    "the x - ray transient xte  j1752@xmath0223 was discovered by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) on 2009 october 23 . the 2010 outburst of xte  j1752@xmath0223 was monitored by the _",

    "the outburst exhibited an evolving behavior in agreement with what would be expected from a stellar mass black hole binary .    in the preceding low - hard x - ray state ,",
    "the radio counterpart was identified by the atca ( australia telescope compact array ) with a flux density of @xmath12  mjy and a flat spectrum consistent with that of a compact jet @xcite .",
    "xte  j1752@xmath0223 started to transit toward a high - soft x - ray state around 2010 january 20 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a 10-fold increase of radio flux density and a flat spectrum were observed by the atca on 2010 january 21 @xcite .",
    "the increased flux density suggested that a major ejection was imminent @xcite and , indeed , a transient jet was detected by the rapid - response evn ( european vlbi newtork ) observations on 2010 february 11 .",
    "the transitions from a low - hard x - ray state toward a high - soft x - ray state are in fact , commonly associated with discrete ejection events @xcite .",
    "together with follow - up vlba ( very long baseline array ) observations in 2010 february , the transient jet was found to show significant deceleration , possibly due to the jet interaction with the surrounding medium ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) .     +    in this paper we present results from the additional three epochs that show a new transient ejection event and later a stationary feature which we identify as the core .",
    "the observations and data reduction are briefly described in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "the very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) as well as the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) imaging results are presented in section  [ sec3 ] . the proper motion of a transient ejecta detected in one of our earlier observations is analyzed in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "we discuss our results on the compact jet region , the proper motion of the transient ejecta and their possible interaction with the large - scale medium in section  [ sec5 ] .",

    "the observations before march 2010 were already presented in paper  i. additional evn observations were carried out on 2010 march 22 , including effelsberg , the phased array wsrt , onsala , medicina , noto , toru , and the lovell telescope . there were two epochs of vlba observations on 2010 april 25 and 29 using the whole telescope array .",
    "all the experiments used the same phase - referencing source ( pmn  j1755@xmath02232 ) and the same duty - cycle .",
    "the vlbi calibration procedure was identical as well , and it is described in paper  i. we note that the new evn observations show a weak extended jet in the calibrator source , but since the radio core accounts for @xmath190% of the emission , this extension did not have a significant effect on the phase calibration in the first four epochs . in the wsrt data , we did self - calibration on pmn  j1755@xmath02232 and applied the solutions to the target .",

    "component d was found to have no detectable proper motion with respect to the reference source at the last two vlbi epochs .",
    "the only explanation for this is that component d is the radio core of the system .",
    "we note that @xcite arrived to the same conclusion first : they independently analyzed data from the last two vlba epochs , and showed that component d was positionally consistent with the optical counterpart of xte  j1752@xmath0223 , within a @xmath4  mas error circle .",
    "they had only a 3.5@xmath5 detection on 2010 february 29 . in our analysis",
    ", we obtained a considerably higher significance of the detection reaching 5@xmath5 , firmly establishing that component d is related to the core region / compact jet in xte  j1752@xmath0223 and not related to a new transient ejecta .    compared with the most sensitive evn observations of 2010 march 22 during the x - ray soft state ,",
    "the radio core re - brightened by a factor of @xmath610 .",
    "the non - detection in the earlier soft state is unlikely caused by the fast variability because the core was not detected on short time scales .",
    "the re - appearance provides a rare case of direct detection of the re - activation of radio emission in the compact jet during the soft to hard x - ray state transition , as described by the unified model for the coupling of accretion and ejection in black hole x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "in fact , _ rxte _ observations on 2010 march 27 have revealed xte  j1752@xmath0223 in transition from the soft to the hard state @xcite .",
    "the compact jet appears highly variable .",
    "however , we note that the declination of the source is low and the strong apparent variation might be due to poor tropospheric conditions especially at the beginning and end of the observations , when the source elevation was very low",
    ". however the atca observations did show significant variations on timescales of days ( brocksopp et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . in literature",
    ", strong daily variations were also observed in xte  j1720@xmath0318 in the post low hard state @xcite .",
    "significant flux density variation on shorter ( @xmath7  day ) time scale were seen in grs  1915@xmath8105 @xcite and xte  j1650@xmath0500 @xcite .      according to the new proper motion measurements ,",
    "component b is a transient jet component moving toward the same direction as component a ( cf .",
    "paper  i ) , in agreement with the core location discussed above .",
    "although we could not measure the proper motion of component c in the same way as component b , it lies between components a and b which indicates that there were at least three ejection events revealed by the vlbi observations during the 2010 outburst of xte  j1752@xmath0223 .",
    "the source shows a profound one - sided morphology , unprecedented for x - ray black hole binaries with transient ejecta .",
    "we searched for the receding jet in the vlbi images including the deep evn image .",
    "there were no receding ejecta found .",
    "if component a was ejected during the major x - ray outburst around mjd  55218 , a mean proper motion of @xmath128  masd@xmath3 is required to explain the large angular separation from the assumed core .",
    "considering the low proper motion of @xmath910  masd@xmath3 observed at the later stage , component a must have an extremely high proper motion at the early stage . the high proper motion observed in component b , an ejecta much closer to the core than component a",
    ", indirectly supports the association of component a with the major outburst . as a relativistic jet usually evolves with a decaying luminosity after the ejection , the non - detection of component b observed three days earlier is unlikely due to the insufficient sensitivity . assuming component b was ejected around mjd  55250.6 ( during another flare , brocksopp et al . in prep .",
    ") , its average proper motion is @xmath158  masd@xmath3 , in agreement with our measurements .",
    "component b has a high apparent speed of @xmath10.7  c if it is at 3.5  kpc as estimated by @xcite via the spectral - timing correlation scaling technique ( model - dependent ) .",
    "however , if the source is located at a larger distance , e.g. near the galactic centre , then xte  j1752@xmath0223 might be another example of superluminal galactic jets , such as grs  1915@xmath8105 @xcite and gro  j1655@xmath040 @xcite .",
    "taking into account that component b might have already somewhat decelerated by the time it was detected , xte  j1752@xmath0223 is a promising galactic superluminal source candidate .",
    "the resulting doppler deboosting effect may be responsible for the non - detection of the receding transient jets , a rarely - seen property in stellar mass black hole binaries .",
    "there might be an extended emission in rough agreement with the position angle of the transient jet between xte  j1752@xmath0223 and g006.3904@xmath801.9844 in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "such the extended emission might be a large - scale diffuse relic emission associated with the transient .",
    "as the limited sensitivity @xmath10  mjy  beam@xmath3 , deep observations at lower frequencies are required to confirm its existence .",
    "a jet - blown bubble , @xmath15  pc in diameter , is found in  cygnus x-1 @xcite .",
    "it is inferred that there exists a cavity surrounding microquasars @xcite .",
    "as xte  j1752@xmath0223 showed strong jet decelerations , it is a promising candidate for the deep observations to hunt for the extended emission region .",
    "we investigated the proper motion of the closest ejecta to the assumed core among the detected transient jet components in the 2010 outburst of xte  j1752@xmath0223 .",
    "besides measuring proper motion through splitting the experiment into a few time bins , we looked for a proper motion via monitoring the variation of the image peak brightness of the proper motion - corrected visibility data .",
    "both ways give a very high proper motion and imply that the ejections are at least mildly relativistic .",
    "we also reported the detection of another new ejecta observed at the end of 2010 march .",
    "we provided another independent vlbi identification of the compact jet and have shown that it might be highly variable .",
    "moreover , we found a hint on the large - scale extended emission in the field of xte  j1752@xmath0223 with the wsrt observations .",
    "we thank the evn programme committee and the vlba proposal selection committee for prompt approval of our observations .",
