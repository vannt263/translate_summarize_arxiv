    "@xcite this observation was confirmed by weight measurements after dissolving the chains and their monomer matrix.@xcite consequently , the opto - electronic properties of the pdas result from the electrons mutual interaction and their interaction with the lattice potential , while the influence of disorder is negligible .",

    "@xcite the comparison shows that electronic exchange and correlations account for a substantial fraction of the single - particle gap .",
    "in contrast to inorganic semiconductors , the exciton binding energy in pdas amounts to about 20% of the single - particle gap .",
    "such large binding energies suggest that the electron - electron interaction must be treated accurately for the calculation of the optical properties of the pdas .    in order to describe the optical excitations in pdas",
    ", two approaches have been taken .",
    "the first approach starts from an ab - initio density - functional theory calculation of the bare band structure in local - density approximation ( lda ) , which is then supplemented by an approximate treatment of the residual electron - electron interaction , e.g. , the @xmath11 approximation for the single - particle bands and the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) for the excitons ( lda+@xmath11+bse ) .",
    "@xcite actual calculations for the pdas often omit the @xmath11  step ( wannier theory ) .",
    "@xcite within this approach , a number of experimental data can be reproduced , e.g. , the @xmath12 exciton binding energy and its polarizability .",
    "this approach is less successful for the triplet sector .",
    "@xcite typically , the energy of the triplet ground state is too high .",
    "recall that , if the electron - electron interaction is absent , the energy of the triplet ground state is identical to the single - particle gap . starting from a weak - coupling description of the electron - electron interaction on the chains ,",
    "it is difficult to obtain the experimentally observed energy renormalization by a factor of almost three .",
    "@xcite moreover , polaronic effects are not considered in the lda+bse approach .",
    "the second approach to a theoretical description of the primary excitations in polymers starts from a many - particle model hamiltonian that describes only the @xmath13-electrons and their mutual interaction .",
    "typically , empirical parameters are used for the tight - binding band structure and for the pariser - parr  pople ( ppp ) potential .",
    "@xcite with the help of the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) method,@xcite the ground state and elementary excitations for such models can be calculated for large chains with very high accuracy . in this way",

    "the local hubbard repulsion potential is substantially larger than the corresponding ohno interaction .",

    "some preliminary studies show that the energy difference between the singlet and triplet ground states is not influenced by the introduction of a local potential for the carbon atoms which are linked to the side groups .",
    "we presume that the dominant influence of the side groups comes from the presence ( or absence ) of strain in the chains . as can be seen from the data for 3bcmu and 4bcmu , different ligands and the resulting strain results in small energetic differences , of about @xmath15 for the nbcmu family .",
