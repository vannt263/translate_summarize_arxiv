    "an idea that the observable acceleration of the universe could be a result of large - distance modification of gravity is attractive , and is experimentally testable @xcite@xcite .",
    "moreover , large - distance modifications of gravity give rise to a conceptually new approach to the long - standing cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "hence , development of the models of modified gravity becomes an important task .",
    "the dgp model @xcite is a covariant theory of the large - distance modification of gravity ( see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "interactions in this model are mediated by a single graviton that lives in infinite - volume five - dimensional space - time .",
    "this graviton resembles a massive 4d spin-2 state since it has five polarizations .",
    "experimental constraints on extra light states with gravitational interactions are rather severe , therefore , the question of how these extra polarizations interact with observable matter and with themselves becomes crucial for the consistency of the model .    from a 4d perspective",
    ", the graviton behaves as a state of a nonzero decay width . as such it shares certain properties of a massive graviton ( and massive non - abelian gauge fields ) .",
    "if non - abelian gauge fields are prescribed mass @xmath0 by hand ( i.e. , without using the higgs mechanism ) , then the nonlinear amplitudes of the theory become strong at a scale @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a gauge - coupling constant .",
    "a similar effect exists in a theory of gravity in which mass @xmath3 is introduced by hand as in ref .",
    "this was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , by calculating nonlinear corrections to a spherically symmetric static body of the gravitational radius @xmath4 , in which case the weak - field approximation breaks down at a scale @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this breakdown is a universal property of the perturbative expansion in the massive theory as it can be understood by looking at tree - level trilinear graviton vertex diagrams @xcite .",
    "a simplest trilinear ( graviton)@xmath6 diagram gives rise to the @xmath7 singularity @xcite . for small @xmath3 this diagram is enhanced even though it is multiplied by an extra power of the newton constant .",
    "this can also be understood in terms of interactions of the longitudinal polarizations becoming strong @xcite . for the pure gravitational sector itself",
    "the corresponding scale @xmath8 reduces to @xmath9 , which can be made only as big as @xmath10 by adding higher nonlinear terms @xcite .",
    "the reason for the breakdown of perturbation theory at a low scale can be traced back to terms in the graviton propagator that contain products of the structure [ sing ] with similar structures or with the flat space metric .",
    "these terms do not manifest themselves in physical amplitudes at the linear level since they are multiplied by conserved currents , however , they enter nonlinear diagrams leading to the breakdown of perturbation theory for massive non - abelian gauge fields or massive gravity .    in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite the graviton decay width is introduced by adding to general relativity a term that is reparametrization invariant ( see the action ( [ 1 ] ) ) . as a result ,",
    "the terms similar to ( [ sing ] ) in the propagator are gauge dependent . in a simple gauge adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite they read as follows : , [ singdgp ] where @xmath11 is a counterpart of @xmath3 and @xmath12 is a root of the euclidean momentum square . because of the singularity in @xmath13 in ( [ singdgp ] ) , perturbation theory breaks down precociously @xcite .",
    "however , this breakdown is an artifact of an ill - defined perturbative expansion  the known exact solutions of the model have no trace of the breakdown scale ( see ref .",
    "this shows that if one sums up all the tree - level perturbative diagrams , then the breakdown scale should disappear .",
    "a more ambitious program is to asks for quantum consistency of the model as an effective theory with a cutoff .",
    "such a consistency can only be established within the perturbation theory .",
    "the latter is ill - defined above the scale @xmath10 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , because of the same nonlinear diagrams that make the weak - field expansion ill - defined already at the classical level @xcite . however , it is not clear whether the new scale that emerges in perturbation theory has any physical significance .",
    "the perturbative breakdown at the quantum level could be an artifact of the technical method itself .",
    "as was recently argued by dvali @xcite , in a certain toy sigma model a similar breakdown takes place , however , the full resumed solution of the theory is valid well above the naive breaking scale .    in the next section",
    "i will discuss in detail the reasons for the breakdown of perturbation theory in the dgp model . then , in section 3 i will show how one can _ define _ a different perturbative procedure such that the singular terms like ( [ singdgp ] ) are eliminated from the propagator and the uv behavior of the amplitudes is regular all the way up to the cutoff of the theory .",
    "the effective one - graviton exchange amplitude between two sources with the stress - tensors @xmath14 that i will calculate in section 3 takes the form : = 1p^2+m_cp ( t_^2- 12t^2 p^2 + 2m_cp p^2 + 3m_cp ) .",
    "[ adgp0 ] this amplitude interpolates between the four - dimensional behavior at @xmath15 and the five - dimensional behavior at @xmath16 .",
    "it has no poles on a physical riemann sheet and satisfies requirements of unitarity , analyticity and causality .",
    "notice that the naive perturbation theory in the dgp model has no strong coupling scale if the localized 5d einstein - hilbert term is used on the brane worldvolume @xcite and in the `` dielectric '' regularization of the dgp model @xcite . in higher dimensional generalizations of the dgp model @xcite ,",
    "the perturbation theory is well - defined and there is no problem in the first place as was recently shown in @xcite .",
    "the concern of the present work is the five - dimensional model with the four - dimensional induced term ( see the action ( [ 1 ] ) below ) .",
    "a brief answer to the above question is as follows .",
    "the dgp model has two _ dimensionful _ parameters : the newton constant @xmath17 and the graviton lifetime @xmath13 . as a result ,",
    "the naive perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath17 is contaminated by powers of @xmath18 .",
    "hence , for small values of @xmath13 perturbation theory breaks down for the unusually low value of the energy scale .",
    "the question is whether this breakdown is an artifact of perturbation theory , or it could be that the breaking scale is truly a physical scale at which the model needs certain uv completion .",
    "depending on a concrete model at hand , the either of above two possibilities could be realized .    to study these issues in detail",
    "we consider the action of the dgp model @xcite s=^2 d^4xr(g)+ ^3 d^4xdy r_5(|g ) , [ 1 ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the four - dimensional and five - dimensional ricci scalars , respectively , and @xmath21 stands for the gravitational scale of the bulk theory .",
    "the analog of the graviton mass is @xmath22 .",
    "the higher - dimensional and four - dimensional metric tensors are related as ( x , y=0)g(x ) .",
    "[ bargg ] there is a boundary ( a brane ) at @xmath23 and @xmath24 symmetry across the boundary is imposed .",
    "the presence of the boundary gibbons - hawking term is implied to warrant the correct einstein equations in the bulk .",
    "matter fields are assumed to be localized on a brane and at low energies , that we observe , they do not escape into the bulk .",
    "hence , the matter action is completely four - dimensional @xmath25 .",
    "our conventions are : @xmath26\\ , ; a , b = 0,1,2,3,{\\it 5}\\,;\\mu,\\nu = 0,1,2,3.$ ]    the simplest problem is to calculate the green s function @xmath27 and the amplitude of interaction of two sources @xmath14 on the brane _ 1-graviton t_d^ ; t_. [ a ] in order to perform perturbative calculations one has to fix a gauge .",
    "a simple way adopted in @xcite is to use harmonic gauge in the bulk @xmath28 . in this case",
    "the one - graviton exchange amplitude on the brane ( in the momentum space ) takes the form : _",
    "1-graviton(p , y=0)=t^2_1/3 p^2+m_cp , [ a13 ] where we denote the euclidean four - momentum square by @xmath29 : p^2-p^p_=-p_0 ^ 2+p_1 ^ 2 + p_2 ^ 2+p_3 ^ 2p_4 ^ 2+p_1 ^ 2 + p_2 ^",
    "2+p_3 ^ 2 , [ psquare ] and t^2_1/3 8g_n ( t^2_-13tt ) .",
    "[ t1third ] we can see that @xmath30 in ( [ a13 ] ) is non - singular in the @xmath31 limit ( moreover , the pole in the amplitude is on a nonphysical riemann sheet , see discussions in the next section . ) .",
    "however , the gauge dependent part of the propagator @xmath27 contains terms proportional to ( [ singdgp ] ) .",
    "these terms do not enter the one - graviton exchange amplitude , but , they do contribute to higher - order tree - level non - linear diagrams which blow up in the @xmath31 limit @xcite .",
    "the same fact is reflected in the expression for the trace of @xmath32 which in the harmonic gauge takes the form @xcite : ^_(p , y=0 ) = -t 3m_cp .",
    "[ trace ] ( hereafter the tilde - sign denotes fourier - transformed quantities and we put @xmath33 . ) . from this expression",
    "we learn that : ( i ) @xmath34 is a propagating field in this gauge ; ( ii ) @xmath34 propagates as a 5d field , i.e. , it does not see the brane kinetic term ; ( iii ) the expression for @xmath34 is singular in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "the gauge dependent part of the momentum - space propagator @xmath35 contains the terms @xmath36 , which , due to ( [ trace ] ) , give rise to the singular term ( [ singdgp ] ) .",
    "hence , to understand the origin of the breakdown of perturbation theory , one should look at the origin of the @xmath18 scaling in ( [ trace ] ) .    the singular behavior of @xmath34 is a direct consequence of the fact that the four - dimensional ricci curvature @xmath37 in the linearized approximation is forced to be zero by the @xmath38 and/or @xmath39 equations of motion .",
    "this can be seen by direct calculation of @xmath19 and of those equations , but it is more instructive to see this by using the adm decomposition .",
    "the @xmath38 equation reads : r=(k^_)^2-k_^2 , [ adm ] where @xmath40 denotes the extrinsic curvature . since @xmath41 the above equation implies that the four - dimensional curvature @xmath42 and in the linearized order @xmath19 vanishes .",
    "let us now see how this leads to the singular behavior of @xmath43 in ( [ trace ] ) .",
    "the junction condition across the brane contains two types of terms : there are terms proportional to @xmath13 and there are terms that are independent of @xmath13 .",
    "the former come from the bulk einstein - hilbert action while the latter appear due to the worldvolume einstein - hilbert term . in the trace of the junction condition",
    "the @xmath13independent term is proportional to the four - dimensional ricci scalar @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "as we argued above , @xmath19 has no linear in @xmath43 term in the weak - field expansion , simply because these terms cancel out due to the @xmath38 and/or @xmath39 equations .",
    "therefore , in the linearized approximation the junction condition contains only the terms that come from the bulk .",
    "these terms are proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "this inevitably leads to the trace of @xmath43 ( [ trace ] ) that is singular in the @xmath31 limit and triggers the breakdown of the perturbative approach as discussed above .",
    "the above arguments suggest that the two limiting procedures , first truncating the small @xmath43 expansion and only then taking the @xmath31 limit , do not commute with each other .",
    "therefore , the right way to perform the calculations is either to look at exact solutions of classical equations of motion , as was argued in @xcite , or to retain at least quadratic terms in the equations .",
    "the obtained results wo nt be singular in the @xmath31 limit .",
    "however , neither of the above approaches addresses the issue of quantum gravitational loops .",
    "since the loops can only be calculated within a well - defined perturbation theory , one needs to construct a new perturbative expansion that would make diagrams tractable at short distances .    in the next section",
    "we will propose to rearrange perturbation theory in such a way that the consistent answers be obtained in the weak - field approximation .",
    "this can be achieved if the linearized gauge - fixing terms can play the role similar to the nonlinear terms .",
    "we will see that this requires a certain nontrivial procedure of gauge - fixing and choosing of appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "below we develop a perturbative approach that allows to perform calculations in the weak - field approximation without breaking the expansion at a low scale .",
    "we recall that in the dgp model the boundary ( the brane ) breaks explicitly translational invariance in the @xmath45 direction , as well as the rotational symmetry that involves the @xmath45 coordinate . however , this fact is not reflected in the linearized approximation  the linearized theory that follow from ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant under five - dimensional reparametrizations .",
    "this line of arguments suggests to introduce constraints in the linearized theory that would account for the broken symmetries .",
    "it is clear that an arbitrary set of such constraint can not be consistent with equations of motion with boundary conditions on the brane and at @xmath46 .",
    "however , by trial and error a consistent set of constraints and gauge conditions can be found .",
    "below we introduce this set of equations step by step .",
    "we start by imposing the following condition : b _ _ h_55 + ^h _ = 0 .",
    "[ bmu ] furthermore , to make the kinetic term for the @xmath39 component invertible we set a second condition : b_5^h_5=0 .",
    "[ b5 ] at a first sight , the two conditions ( [ bmu ] ) and ( [ b5 ] ) fix all the @xmath47-dependent gauge transformations and make the gauge kinetic terms non - singular and invertible .",
    "however , at a closer inspection this does not appear to be satisfactory .",
    "one can look at the @xmath48 component of the equations of motion and integrate this equation w.r.t .",
    "@xmath45 from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , with @xmath51 . after the integration ,",
    "all the terms with @xmath52 and @xmath53 vanish . the resulting equation ( which is just the israel junction condition ) taken by its own , is invariant under the following four - dimensional transformations h^_(x^ , y)|_y=0=h_(x , y)|_y=0 + _ _ |_y=0 + _ _ |_y=0 .",
    "[ branetransf ] this suggests that in the @xmath31 limit the gauge kinetic term on the brane is not invertible . as a result , the problem of a precocious breakdown of perturbation theory discussed in the previous section arises . to avoid this difficulty one can introduce the following term on the brane worldvolume : s - ^2d^4x dy ( y ) ( ^h _ - 12 _ h^ _ ) ^2 .",
    "[ gauge ] this makes the graviton kinetic term of the brane invertible even in the @xmath54 limit . at this stage ,",

    "the second pole in ( [ poles ] ) can be interpreted as a `` metastable ghost '' with a momentum - dependent decay width that accompanies the fifth polarization and cancels its contributions at short distances .",
    "remarkably , this state does not give rise to the usual instabilities because it can only appear in _ intermediate states _ in feynman diagrams , but does not appear in the _ in _ and _ out _ states in the s - matrix elements . in this respect , it is more appropriate to think that the scalar graviton polarization acquires the form - factor @xmath77 ( [ gp ] ) .",
    "the above results seem somewhat puzzling from the point of view of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) decomposition .",

    "the kllen - lehmann representation for the amplitude as a sum w.r.t .",

    "however , this is not so",
    ". the crucial difference of the present approach from the conventional kk theories is that the effective 4d states are mixed states of an infinite number of tensor and scalar modes .",
    "what is responsible for the mixing between the different spin states is the brane - induced term and the present procedure of imposing the constraints . in the covariant gauge",
    "that we discuss the trace of @xmath43 propagates and mixes with tensor fields . from the kk point of view this would look as an infinite tower of states with wrong kinetic terms .",
    "however , at least in the linearized approximation , the trace is a gauge artifact ( similar to the zeroth component of the gauge field in covariantly gauge - fixed qed or qcd ) .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of the trace part is that the true physical eigenmodes do not carry a definite four - dimensional spin of a local four - dimensional theory ( see also @xcite ) . because of this there is no reason to split the amplitude ( [ adgpsplit ] ) into the term that is proportional to @xmath78 and the rest .",
    "the question of interactions of these states in the full nonlinear theory is not addressed in the present work .",
    "what happens with the diagrams in which the `` metastable ghosts '' propagate in the loops ( the unitarity cuts of which should give production of these multiple states ) remains unknown .",
    "however , since the theory possesses 4d reparametrization invariance , we expect that these questions will find answers similar to those of non - abelian gauge fields .",
    "further studies are being conducted to understand these issues .",
    "to summarize briefly , a new , _ constrained perturbative expansion _ was proposed . in this approach perturbation theory is well - formulated .",
    "the resulting amplitude interpolates between the 4d behavior at observable distances and 5d behavior at super - horizon scales .",
    "this is due to the scalar polarization of the graviton that acquires a momentum - dependent form - factor . as a result , the scalar decouples with high accuracy from the observables at sub - horizon distances .",
    "the model can potentially evade the no - go theorem for massive / metastable gravity @xcite , that states that for the cancellation of the extra scalar polarization one should introduce a ghost that would give rise to instabilities @xcite . in the present model , at least in the linearized approximation",
    ", such instabilities do not occur .",
    "the convenient ( although not precise ) picture is to think of a `` metastable ghost '' that exists only as an intermediate state in feynman diagrams which does not appear in the final states at least in the linearized theory . since this state can not be emitted in physical processes , it does not give rise to the usual instability .",
    "the latter property is similar to the observation made in the `` dielectric '' regularization of the dgp model in @xcite .",
    "the questions that remain open concern the gauge - fixing and interactions in the full non - linear theory where the faddeev - popov ghosts are expected to play a crucial role . these issues will be addressed elsewhere .",
