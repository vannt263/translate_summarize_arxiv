    "in an optically non - linear atomic medium , dispersion and absorption of a classical light beam depend on powers of its amplitude @xcite . at the quantum level ,",
    "dispersive optical non - linearities translate into effective interactions between photons .",
    "the ability to achieve such strong quantum optical non - linearities is of prominent importance in quantum communication and computation for it would allow to implement photonic conditional two - qubit gates .",
    "the standard kerr dispersive non linearities obtained in non - interacting atomic ensembles , either in off - resonant two - level or resonant three - level configurations involving electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , are too small to allow for quantum non - linear optical manipulations .",
    "to further enhance such non - linearities , eit protocols were put forward in which the upper level of the ladder is a rydberg level . in such schemes ,",
    "the strong van der waals interactions between rydberg atoms result in a cooperative rybderg blockade phenomenon @xcite , where each rydberg atom prevents the excitation of its neighbors inside a blockade sphere .",
    "this rydberg blockade deeply changes the eit profile and leads to magnified non - linear susceptibilities @xcite .",
    "in particular , giant dispersive non - linear effects were experimentally obtained in an off - resonant rydberg - eit scheme using cold rubidium atoms placed in an optical cavity @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we theoretically investigate the quantum statistical properties of the light generated in the latter protocol .",
    "note that , contrary to other theoretical works , e.g. @xcite , here , we are interested in the dispersive regime .",
    "moreover , since we place the atoms in a cavity rather than in free - space , the theoretical framework and calculations we perform also differ from @xcite .",
    "in particular , a technical benefit of our approach is that we are not restricted to considering only photon pairs but could , in principle , investigate higher - order correlations .",
    "we first write the dynamical equations for the system of interacting three - level atoms coupled to the strong control field and the non - resonant cavity mode , fed by the probe beam .",
    "we show that , under some assumptions , the system effectively behaves as a large spin coupled to the cavity mode @xcite .",
    "we then compute the steady - state second - order correlation function to characterize the emission of photons out of the cavity .",
    "our numerical simulations suggest that the bunched or antibunched nature of the outgoing light as well as its coherence time may be controlled through adjusting the detuning between the cavity mode and probe field frequencies .",

    "finally , we introduce @xmath23 and @xmath24 which are the single - atom coupling constant of the transition @xmath13 with the cavity mode and the rabi frequency of the control field on the transition @xmath14 , respectively . in the following paragraphs , we study the dynamics of the system which , under some assumptions , is equivalent to a damped harmonic oscillator , _ i.e. _ the cavity mode , coupled to an assembly of spins @xmath25 , _ i.e. _ the rydberg bubbles corresponding to the super - atoms delimited by the rydberg blockade spheres .",

    "note that the result we obtain coincides with the lowest - order of eit model ",
    "the non - linearity of the three - level atoms is neglected , and the leading non - linear effect comes from the rydberg - rydberg collisional effects .",

    "the quantity @xmath37 is the van der waals interaction between atoms @xmath38 in their rydberg level  when atoms are in the ground or intermediate states , their interactions are neglected , while @xmath39 is the effective coupling strength of the two - photon transition @xmath40 driven by the cavity mode and the control laser .    at this point ,",
    "following @xcite , we introduce the rydberg bubble approximation . in this approach ,",
    "the strong rydberg interactions are assumed to effectively split the sample into @xmath41 bubbles @xmath42 each of which contains @xmath43 atoms but can only accomodate a single rydberg excitation , delocalized over the bubble .",

    "the plot corresponding to ( a ) always remains on the antibunched side , though asymptotically tending to @xmath111 .",
    "the features observed can be understood and satisfactorily accounted for by a simple three - level model .",
    "indeed , due to the weakness of @xmath22 , the system , in its steady state , is expected to contain at most two excitations ( either photonic or atomic ) . after a photon detection at @xmath70",
    ", it contains at most one excitation which can be exchanged between the cavity field and atoms , as it has been known for long @xcite . in other words ,",

    ", it is worth mentioning that the two - boson approximation , though strictly speaking not applicable here  the parameters considered in this section indeed correspond to a number of bubbles @xmath115 , yields , however , the qualitative behaviour for @xmath2 . the minimum is correctly located , though slightly higher than in the spin model ; the antibunching peak is slightly shifted towards positive detunings and is weaker than in the previous treatment .",
    "these discrepancies result from too low a value of the non - linearity parameter @xmath116 ; they can be corrected through replacing @xmath117 by @xmath118 in the two - boson hamiltonian .",
    "we first note that @xmath116 and @xmath119 coincide in the regime of large number of bubbles .",
    "moreover , @xmath119 makes sense in the regime of low number of bubbles : in particular , when @xmath120 , _ i.e.",
    "_ when only one bubble is available , the non - linearity , proportional to @xmath119 , diverges accordingly , therefore forbidding the boson field to contain more than one excitation .",
    "finally , let us mention that @xmath119 can also be recovered via a perturbative treatment of the full model which will be presented in a future paper .",
    "in this work , we studied how the strong rydberg - rydberg van der waals interactions in an atomic medium may affect the quantum statistical properties of an incoming light beam . in our model ,",
    "atoms are located in a low finesse cavity and subject to a weak signal beam and a strong control field .",
    "these two fields non - resonantly drive the transition from the ground to a rydberg level .",
    "the system was shown to effectively behave as a large spin coupled to a damped harmonic oscillator , _",
    "i.e. _ the assembly of rydberg bubbles and the cavity mode , respectively .",
    "the strong anharmonicity of the atomic spin affects the quantum statistics of the outgoing light beam . to demonstrate this effect",
    ", we performed analytical and numerical calculations of the second - order correlation function @xmath121 .",
    "the results we obtained on a specific physical example with rubidium atoms show indeed that the transmitted light presents either bunched or antibunched characters , depending on the detuning between the cavity mode and the probe field .",
    "this suggests that , in such a setup , one could design light of arbitrary quantum statistics through appropriately adjusting the physical parameters .    in this work",
    ", we performed the rydberg bubble approximation , which allowed us to derive a tractable effective hamiltonian .",
    "this scheme is , however , questionable : interactions between bubbles are indeed neglected , and the different spatial arrangements of the bubbles in the sample are not considered .",
    "though challenging , it would be interesting to run full simulations of the system , rejecting those states which are too far off - resonant due to rydberg - rydberg interactions . besides validating the assumption of the present work , this would indeed enable us to consider other regimes , such as , for instance , the case of resonant transition towards the rydberg level .",
    "we also implicitly made the assumption that the cavity mode and control beam were homogeneous .",
    "spatial variations should be included in the model and their potential influence studied in a future work .",
    "finally , due to the very weak probe field regime considered in this paper , we only presented results on the function @xmath0 : the production of @xmath122 correlated photons is indeed very unlikely . in principle , we can , however , numerically compute @xmath123 for any @xmath124 , which might be relevant in a future work , if addressing stronger probe fields .",
