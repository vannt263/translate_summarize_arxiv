    "consequently , errors in the measurement of the flow and the density due to a neglection of correlations partly account for the observed scattering of flow - density data in the congested regime .",

    "when kerner started to question all traffic models with a fundamental diagram , physicists were used to simulate traffic in closed systems with periodic boundary conditions . with the kerner - konhuser model , it was possible to produce free traffic , emergent stop - and - go waves , and triggered wide moving jams @xcite .",

    "moreover , let us assume the model has ranges of stable traffic flow at small and high densities , a range of linearly unstable traffic flow at medium densities , and ranges of metastable traffic flow in between .",

    "this is in agreement with empirical observations @xcite .",
    "most cases of traffic congestion on an @xmath36-lane freeway are observed upstream of on - ramps or other bottlenecks .",

    "one can distinguish the following cases @xcite ( see fig .",

    "`` pinch effect '' _",
    "in contrast to oct , stop - and - go traffic is characterized by a sequence of moving jams , between which traffic flows freely .",
    "each traffic jam triggers the next one by inducing a small perturbation at the ramp , which propagates downstream as long as it is small , but turns back when it has grown large enough ( _ `` boomerang effect '' _ , cf .",

    "<S> we critically discuss the concept of `` synchronized flow '' from a historical , empirical , and theoretical perspective . </S>",
    "<S> problems related to the measurement of vehicle data are highlighted , and questionable interpretations are identified . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we propose a quantitative and consistent theory of the empirical findings based on a phase diagram of congested traffic states , which is universal for all conventional traffic models having the same instability diagram and a fundamental diagram . </S>",
    "<S> new empirical and simulation data supporting this approach are presented as well . </S>",
    "<S> we also give a short overview of the various phenomena observed in panicking pedestrian crowds relevant from the point of evacuation of buildings , ships , and stadia . </S>",
