    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is one of the most important properties to understand the low - energy phenomena of qcd in the real world .",
    "this chiral symmetry is expected to be restored in qcd at several extreme conditions such as qcd with a large number of massless quarks , large @xmath0 qcd ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and qcd in hot and/or dense matter ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the infrared ( ir ) fixed point existing at a two - loop beta function for a large number of massless quarks ( @xmath1 )  @xcite , it was found through the improved ladder schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation that chiral symmetry restoration takes place for @xmath0 such that @xmath2 , where @xmath3(@xmath4 for @xmath5 ) .",
    "then , in ref .  @xcite this chiral restoration at @xmath6 was further identified with `` conformal phase transition '' which was characterized by the essential singularity scaling . moreover ,",
    "such chiral restoration is also observed by other various methods such as lattice simulation  @xcite , dispersion relation  @xcite , instanton calculus  @xcite , effective field theoretical approach  @xcite , etc ..    more attention has been paid to the property of the phase transition .",
    "especially , it is interesting to ask what are the light degrees of freedom near the phase transition point in the large @xmath0 qcd : for example , in the manifestation of the chiral symmetry restoration  la the linear sigma model , the scalar bound state becomes a chiral partner of the pseudoscalar bound state and becomes massless at the phase transition point . on the contrary , in the vector manifestation ( vm )",
    "@xcite obtained by the effective field theoretical approach based on the hidden local symmetry model  @xcite , it is the vector bound state which becomes massless as a chiral partner of the pseudoscalar bound state . besides , from the viewpoint of the conformal phase transition  @xcite , it is natural to suppose that all the existing bound states become massless near the phase transition point when approached from the broken phase ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    then , it is quite interesting to study which types of the bound states actually exist near the phase transition point , and investigate the critical behavior of their masses directly from qcd",
    ". such studies from the first principle will give us a clue to understand the nature of the chiral phase transition in large @xmath0 qcd .    a powerful tool to study the bound states of quark and anti -",
    "quark directly from qcd is the homogeneous bethe - salpeter ( hbs ) equation in the ( improved ) ladder approximation ( see , for reviews , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . when the mass of the quark is regarded as a constant",
    ", we can easily solve the hbs equation by using a so - called fictitious eigenvalue method  @xcite .",
    "however , for consistency with the chiral symmetry , the quark propagator in the hbs equation must be obtained by solving the sd equation with the same kernel as that used in the hbs equation  @xcite , and as a result , the quark mass becomes a certain momentum dependent function .",
    "then , in order to obtain the masses and the wave functions of the bound states , it is necessary to solve the hbs equation and the sd equation simultaneously .",
    "when we try to solve these two equations in real - life ( @xmath7 ) qcd , however , we encounter difficulties .",
    "first of all , for the consistency of the solution of the sd equation with qcd in a high energy region , we need to use the running coupling which obeys the evolution determined from qcd @xmath8-function in the high energy region ( see , for reviews , refs .",
    "since the running coupling diverges at some infrared scale , @xmath9 , we have to regularize the running coupling in the low energy region , for which there exist several ways ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "even if we fix the infrared regularization in such a way that we can solve the sd equation on the real ( space - like ) axis , another problem arises when we try to solve the hbs equation .",
    "since the argument of the quark mass function in the hbs equations for the massive bound states becomes a complex quantity after the wick rotation has been made , we have to solve the sd equation on the complex plane , which requires an analytic continuation of the running coupling .",
    "several works such as in refs .",
    "@xcite proposed models of running couplings for a general complex variable which are consistent with perturbative qcd for large space - like momentum .",
    "however , they still have branch cuts on the complex plane , and it is a complicated task to obtain the solution of the sd equation for a general complex variable .",
    "one way to avoide a such complication is solving the inhomogeneous bs equation for vertex functions to obtain the current correlators in the space - like region which we can fit the mass of the relevant bound state to ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . another way might be replacing the entire running coupling with an ad hoc analytic function ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "anyway , it is impossible to solve the sd equation on the complex plane without modeling the running coupling .    in this paper",
    ", we point out that the situation dramatically changes when we increase the number of massless quarks .",
    "when @xmath0 becomes larger than @xmath10 , the running coupling obtained from the renormalization group equation ( rge ) with two - loop approximation takes a finite value for all the range of the energy region due to the emergence of the non - trivial ir fixed point .",
    "then , we need no infrared regularization , and we do not have any ambiguities coming from the regularization scheme which do exist in the case of small @xmath0 . moreover , an explicit solution of the two - loop rge can be written in terms of the lambert @xmath11 function  @xcite , and when @xmath0 is close to @xmath6 the solution of the rge has no singularity on the complex plane except for the time - like axis  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we can solve the sd equation on the complex plane without introducing any models for the running coupling .",
    "based on these facts , we solve the hbs equations for the bound states of quark and anti - quark in large @xmath0 qcd with the improved ladder approximation in the landau gauge . the mass function for complex arguments needed in the hbs equation",
    "is obtained by solving the sd equation with the same kernel as that used in the hbs equation .",
    "we find the solution of the hbs equation in each of the scalar , vector , and axial - vector channels , which implies that the scalar , vector , and axial - vector bound states are actually formed near the phase transition point .",
    "our results show that the masses of the scalar , vector , and axial - vector bound states go to zero as the number of quarks @xmath0 approaches to its critical value @xmath6 where the chiral symmetry restoration takes place .",
    "this may suggest the existence of a new type of manifestation of chiral symmetry restoration in large @xmath0 qcd other than the linear sigma model like manifestation and a simple version of the vector manifestation proposed in ref .",
