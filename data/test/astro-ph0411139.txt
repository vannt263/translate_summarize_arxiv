    "the tunka eas cerenkov array is located in tunka valley , at an altitude of 675 m a.s.l . , and was described in [ 1 ] .",
    "the new fitting function ( ldf ) for the eas cerenkov light lateral distribution , derived from corsika code simulation [ 2 ] , has been applied to tunka data .",
    "the primary energy @xmath0[@xmath1 has been obtained from the measured cherenkov light flux at a distance 175 m from the shower core @xmath2[@xmath3 with corsika sumulated relation : @xmath4 the absolute energy calibration is based on the results obtained with the quest experiment [ 3 ] .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of the experiment has shown that the energy resolution is better than 18% .",
    "the spectrum is derived from data taken in 300 hours , spread over 51 clear moonless nights , with a trigger rate of about 1.8 hz . to construct a spectrum with energy threshold @xmath5 ev , showers with zenith angles @xmath6 and",
    "a core position inside the geometrical area of the array have been selected .",
    "for the range from @xmath7 to @xmath5 ev , events with zenith angles @xmath8 falling inside a 5 times smaller area around the array center have been selected .",
    "lateral and time distributions of eas cherenkov light provide two independent methods to estimate the maximum depth .",
    "the simulation shows , that the ldf steepness @xmath9 is related to the linear distance ( in [ km ] ) from the array to the eas maximum position : @xmath10 .",
    "the cherenkov light pulse fwhm [ ns ] at distances larger than 200 m from the eas axis is related to the relative position of the eas maximum by @xmath11 [ g/@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the total depth of the atmosphere and @xmath14 is the zenith angle of the shower .",
    "this relation depends only on the distance to the eas axis .",
    "for example , for distance of 250 m : @xmath15 .",
    "this method gives a better theoretical accuracy , than the first one .",
    "moreover , the @xmath16 estimate does not depend on assumptions about the primary nucleus .",
    "figure 2 presents the mean depth of the eas maximum , derived with the two methods described above , as a function of primary energy .",
    "it is seen that the threshold of the fwhm method is higher than that of the ldf steepness method , but the mean depths , obtained with the two different methods are in good agreement .",
    "the mean values of @xmath16 from fig.2 can be easily transformed to the mean logarithmic mass @xmath17 of primary particles .",
    "figure 3 represents the result . a slight correction , derived from mc simulations of the experiment ( assuming a 4-group mass composition , p : he : cno : fe = 0.3:0.3:0.2:0.2 ) has been applied .",
    "according to these data the mass composition has almost no energy dependence in the range from @xmath5 to @xmath18 ev and is compatible with the hypothetical composition with @xmath19 mentioned above . at energies above @xmath18 ev , however , a steep increase of the average mass is observed . a similar increase in average mass",
    "is observed in almost all experiments .",
    "points of the present work coincide with kascade data [ 4 ] at the energy of the knee .",
    "authors are thankful to professor gianni navarra and eas - top collaboration for the opportunity to carry out the calibration experiment quest at the eas - top array ."
