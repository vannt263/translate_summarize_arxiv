    "one of the most important properties of complex systems is community structure .",
    "real - world complex systems are organized in a modular way , with clusters of units sharing similar dynamics or functionality . however , while the clusters are internally cohesive , they can maintain contrasting dynamics .",
    "the problem of resolving and identifying these mesoscopic structures , without any prior information , is extremely challenging . in financial markets",
    ", the mesoscopic scale corresponds to sets of stocks that share similar price dynamics .",
    "the knowledge of the market structure is highly valuable , and can assist in hedging risks and for better understanding of the market .",
    "consequently , over the past years , scientists have deployed and developed many time series techniques to retrieve qualitative information regarding the hierarchy and structure of financial markets @xcite .",
    "+ a promising approach is that of employing community detection techniques , developed in network theory @xcite , on empirical correlation matrices ( resulted from multiple time series ) .",
    "however , the methods are originally constructed to detect dense clusters of nodes within graphs ( networks ) , and are not adapted to deal with correlation matrices .",
    "recently , a novel method was proposed , which has been specifically designed to detect communities from correlation matrices of multiple time series @xcite .",
    "when applied to financial time series , the method was able to capture the dynamical modularity of real markets . remarkably , the method identified clusters of stocks which are correlated internally , but are anti - correlated with each other . + traditionally , the main object of time series analysis is the characterization of patterns in the amplitude of the increments of the quantities of interest ( stock price in our case ) .",
    "the analysis requires a weighted description of the system , i.e. both the amplitude and the sign of the activity .",
    "indeed , a time series of increments enclose complete information about the amplitude of the fluctuations of the original signal .",
    "however , a significant part of this information is encoded in the purely ` binary ' projection of the time series , i.e. its sign .",
    "recent studies have shown various forms of statistical dependency between the sign and the absolute value of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "recently , a study has shown a robust empirical relationship between binary and non - binary properties of real financial time series @xcite .",
    "the research shows that binary signatures , which retain only the sign of fluctuations , encode significant information regarding the full behaviour of the stock ( both amplitude and direction ) .",
    "motivated by these recent results , here we further explore the higher - order relations between financial time series and their corresponding binary signatures , in a more complex setting .",
    "here we study whether the binary signatures of assets can reproduce the same complex community organization of financial markets , as the weighted information .",
    "+        to this end , we use the daily closing prices of the stocks of three indexes ( s@xmath0p500 , ftse100 and nikkei225 ) over the period 2001 - 2011 . for each index",
    ", we restrict our sample to the maximal group of stocks that are traded continuously throughout the selected period .",
    "this results in 445 stocks for the s@xmath0p500 , 78 stocks for the ftse100 and 193 stocks for the nikkei225 .",
    "given a stock price @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes one of the @xmath3 stocks in the index , and @xmath4 denotes one of the @xmath5 observed temporal snapshots ( days ) , the log - return is defined as @xmath6.\\ ] ] for each stock in the system we use the time series of it s log - returns for our analysis .",
    "this is the construct we refer to as the `` weighted time series '' throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "in contrast , the `` binary signatures '' only reveal the direction of the fluctuation ( sign ) in the price and are defined as @xmath7= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{rr } + 1&r_i(t)>0\\\\ 0&r_i(t)=0\\\\ -1&r_i(t)<0 \\end{array}\\right .. \\label{eq : sign}\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : binarize ] we show a simple example of a weighted time series , along with the corresponding binary projection .",
    "+ the two types of information are in fact different descriptions of the same system , and are used to construct cross - correlation matrices . in turn , we deploy three popular community - detection algorithms @xcite specifically adapted , where necessary , for the correct use of cross - correlation matrices @xcite .",
    "we examine and quantify similarities and variations in the organization of the markets for these two representations .",
    "this approach reveals some interesting results .",
    "first , we can quantify the level of information encoded within the binary signatures , with respect to the full weighted time series .",
    "secondly , we observe that both the binary and weighted representations yield very similar structures , which indicates that most of the information regarding the structure of financial communities is already encoded within the sign of a stock . +",
    "is not shown in the plots , but the its value is reported in each panel . ]    in this section we analyse the eigenvalue density distribution of the cross - correlation matrices for the two representations of the data ( binary and weighted ) . when plotting the density distribution one can identify specific spectral properties that have structural implications .",
    "in other words , it is possible to identify distinct eigenvalues in the spectrum , which correspond to correlated clusters of stocks , and typically indicate a non - trivial structure .",
    "+ to begin , we first need to discuss a filtering technique , based on random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite , which is used to identify non - random properties of empirical correlation matrices .",
    "the majority of the eigenvalues present in the spectrum of an empirical correlation matrix result from randomly induced correlations between the time series . in the generic case , where one measures the correlation between @xmath3 independent random time series for @xmath5 time steps ( the observed period )",
    ", then the resulting correlation matrix would be an @xmath3 by @xmath3 wishart matrix , whose statistical properties are well known @xcite . in the limits",
    "where @xmath8 and @xmath9 the eigenvalues of the wishart matrix are distributed according to a marchenko - pastur distribution @xmath10 and @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "the boundaries @xmath12 and @xmath13 are dependent on the data size and given by @xmath14 ^ 2.\\ ] ] this analytic curve represents the boundaries of the bulk eigenvalues , which predominantly represent noise , and so have little meaning assigned to them . the eigenvalues outside this range",
    "however have structural implications , and correspond to groups of correlated stocks @xcite . as a result",
    ", any empirical correlation matrix @xmath15 can be identified as a sum of of two matrices : + @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the random part aggregated from the eigenvalues in the random spectrum ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19 we refer to @xmath20 as the `` structured '' component , which is composed from those eigenvalues above the boundary of the bulk eigenvalues . @xmath21 .",
    "+ moving forward , in financial markets it well established that stocks typically move up or down together , an effect known as the market mode .",
    "this effect is indicated by the presence of a very large eigenvalue @xmath22 , orders of magnitude larger than the rest .",
    "since this eigenvalue represents a common factor influencing all the stocks in a given market , from a structural perspective , the market mode eigenvalue signifies the presence of one single super - community , containing all the stocks in the market .",
    "+ thus , the other eigenvalues ( not including the market mode ) , which deviate from the bulk , @xmath23 are the ones corresponding to mesoscopic clusters , i.e. groups of stocks with similar dynamics .",
    "this observation results in a further decomposition of the empirical correlation matrix @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the market mode , and @xmath26 represents the remaining correlated groups .",
    "these sub - groups of correlated stocks comprise the mesoscopic structure of the market .",
    "they are also referred as `` group modes '' in some of the literature @xcite .",
    "+ our focus here is to detect these eigenvalues in the spectrum of both the binary and weighted data .",
    "moreover , we want to explore the similarities and differences between the two spectra to inform us about the corresponding structures yielded by each type of data .",
    "+        in figure [ dist1 ] we plot the eigenvalue density distribution for the three different indices .",
    "the top row corresponds to the weighted representation ( log - returns ) , and the bottom row corresponds to the binary representation ( binary signatures ) .",
    "we can observe the known structure of the financial markets in the weighted data , however this complex structure also exists in the binary data .",
    "this result is non trivial . we can observe a market mode , and several deviating eigenvalues also in the `` simpler '' binary data ( with the same order of magnitude ) . + we also want to inspect whether both descriptions of the system function the same under randomization .",
    "the returns of each stock were separately permuted randomly , therefore preserving the total return of the stocks and destroying the daily correlation between the returns .",
    "once the time series entries are shuffled , both binary and weighted correlation matrices end up as elementary random matrices .",
    "as discussed before , the eigenvalues of such matrices will be distributed with a marchenko - pastur distribution .    in figure [ dist2 ]",
    "we plot the density distribution of the shuffled data for the three different indices .",
    "the top row corresponds to the weighted representation ( log - returns ) , and the bottom row corresponds to the binary representation ( binary signatures ) .",
    "as expected , in both cases we observed the known characteristics of a random matrix .",
    "the spectra of both representations collapsed to the known analytic curve .",
    "+ to sum up this section , we identified a sub - group structure both in the weighted and the binary representation of the three indices .",
    "each of the binary spectra we studied retain all the known properties of a `` regular '' ( weighted ) spectrum ( random bulk , market mode and group modes ) .",
    "this result propels us to do a more refined analysis , and to further explore ( and compare ) the sub - group structure of the different indices . in the next section we will apply community detection algorithms to extract a more detailed structure for both representations , so that we can better quantify the similarities and the variations .",
    ".the 10 industry sectors in the global industry classification standard ( gics ) , with the color representation used to highlight the sectors in the following figures . [ cols=\"<,^,<,^ \" , ]     once we obtain the community structure using the different algorithms , our goal is to quantify the dissimilarities ( or similarities ) between the different partitions ( binary and weighted ) .",
    "for this task we apply the variation of information ( vi ) measurement @xcite .",
    "the variation of information is an information - theoretic measure of the distance between two partitions .",
    "the different partitions @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent @xmath3-dimensional vectors where the @xmath2-th component @xmath29 denotes the set in which node @xmath2 is placed by that particular partition .",
    "the variation of information involves the mutual information @xmath30 which is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the joint probability distribution , and @xmath33 the marginal distribution of @xmath34 . the mutual information measures the overlap between the two partitions , however it is not a metric ( does not obeys the triangle inequality ) nor is it normalized .",
    "thus , for this study we use the ( normalized ) variation of information which is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the joint entropy and is defined as @xmath37        the variation of information ranges from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , where @xmath38 indicates two identical partitions , and @xmath39 a complete dissimilarity between the partitions .",
    "first , we measure the variation of information between two partition vectors , generated by the weighted and binary time series . respectively",
    ", this approach enables us to quantify the difference in group structure ( for 2001 - 2011 ) , and compare the performances of the different algorithms .    in table",
    "[ tab : varinfo ] we plot the measured vi between the different partitions , which resulted from the binary and weighted data .",
    "these measurements are for the community structures resulting from 10 years ( 2500 time steps ) of data , for each of the three different indices .",
    "we run the algorithms 1000 times ( for louvain and potts , while the spectral is deterministic ) and extract the partitions that maximize the modularity .",
    "we measure the vi between two different partitions : the most frequent one , and the one that minimizes the vi ( the most similar ones ) .",
    "one can consider this to be the best result ( subject to the best partition ) .",
    "again we should note that all the partitions maximize the modularity , and therefore are optimal . since the vi is not linear ( and not intuitive )",
    ", we also included a simpler measurement of the percentage of stocks that are not occupying the same community in the different partitions .",
    "+ we can observe that both the potts and louvain algorithms consistently perform better then the spectral method , i.e. they yield partitions with higher modularity .",
    "we should note that , one can only compare the value of the modularity for the same representation ( binary or weighted ) , while there is no meaning in comparing modularity between the different representations .",
    "generally , we can observe that the binary information and the weighted information result in very similar structures , as we showed in the previous section .",
    "the exception to this is the ftse index , where the binary information consistently yields a greater number of communities .",
    "it is interesting to note that the binary information always results in either the same or a greater number of communities over the weighted time series .",
    "next , we will explore the evolution in time of the vi between the different types of information .",
    "we considered a sub - period of 600 time steps ( about two and a half years ) , and apply the same procedure as before .",
    "however , here we use a sliding window technique , where in each step we input a new day and ignore the previous information .",
    "this results in 1900 time steps ( from the original 2500 ) , where each point is the frequent vi calculated from the correlation matrix using the given 600 time step . in figure",
    "[ fig : vislide ] we plot the different measurements for the different algorithms .",
    "the potts and the louvain methods present a more stable dynamics , while the spectral method yield higher vi . furthermore , there is no systematic effects of the financial crisis on the similarity between the binary and the weighted representations .",
    "over the last few years community detection methods have revealed themselves as useful tools to study the structure of complex systems . in this context , we have introduced a new approach aiming at analysing structural dependencies , which result form different descriptions ( weighted and binary activity ) of a complex system .",
    "our approach enables us to quantify the level of `` structural information '' encoded within the binary projection of weighted time series , and measure variations and similarities between the different partitions .",
    "+ the analysis reveals that in financial markets both the binary and weighted information yield very similar structures , which also manifest themselves in similar spectral properties .",
    "the algorithms find complex mesoscopic structure of internally correlated clusters , which are residually anti - correlated with each other @xcite .",
    "moreover , the clusters are populated by stocks from various sectors .",
    "remarkably , we show that the simple knowledge of the direction of increments of each stock can reproduce this complex structure very successfully .",
    "+ our findings suggest that the binary signatures of financial time series carry significant structural information .",
    "these results are far from trivial , as one might expect that the full knowledge of the amplitudes of price fluctuations is a key component in clustering the markets into correlated groups .",
    "however , here we explicitly showed that purely binary information can replicate the main features obtained from complete information .",
    "thus , we conclude that the majority of the market structure induced by the binary dynamics of the stocks .",
    "even when the two representations differ by some extent , the binary description provides very sensible information ( as exemplified by the financials sector in the ftse ) . in any case ,",
    "binary projections are much more robust to noise then the original fluctuations , by definition .",
    "we adopt modularity - based community detection methods , which are adapted to correlation matrices . respectively , this restrict us to undirected networks , as a result of sharing by definition the same symmetry property as correlation matrices .",
    "let us consider a network with @xmath3 nodes , one can introduce a number of partitions of the @xmath3 nodes into non - overlapping sets .",
    "the different partitions will be represented by an @xmath3-dimensional vector @xmath40 where the @xmath2-th component @xmath29 denotes the set in which node @xmath2 is placed by that particular partition .",
    "now , we introduce the modularity measure @xmath41 which indicates the quality of a specific choice of partition @xmath40 measured by high degree of inter community connectivity and a low degree of intra community connectivity .",
    "the modularity optimization algorithms look for the specific partition that maximizes the value of @xmath41 , the objective function .",
    "it is defined as @xmath42\\delta(\\sigma_i , \\sigma_j)\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a delta function ensuring that only when @xmath44 ( nodes within the same community ) does it contribute to the sum , and @xmath45 is the adjacency matrix that indicates whether a link exists between the nodes , @xmath46 or not , @xmath47 ( in the binary representation ) .",
    "the pre - factor @xmath48 serves to normalize the value of @xmath41 between @xmath49 and @xmath39 , where @xmath50 is twice the number of total links in the network .",
    "the term @xmath51 is vital to the outcome of the community detection process .",
    "it represents the expectation of whether a link exists or not , according to the specific null model that you consider .",
    "so far the majority of the methods use null models ( hypotheses ) , which are suited only for networks .",
    "for example the configuration model , that preserves the degree sequence ( or strength sequence ) of the network .",
    "it has been shown that such null models can introduce biases when applied to correlation matrices @xcite .",
    "instead , a recent method proposed a redefinition of the modularity , which takes into account the existence of known spectral properties in correlation matrices ( see section [ sa ] ) .",
    "+ now , instead of the previous adjacency matrix @xmath45 , we input the empirical correlation matrix @xmath52 .",
    "the first is the global mode @xmath53(market mode in a financial setting ) , which represents the common movement of the market . in other words , in order to clearly differentiate between the mesoscopic groups , one must subtract out the main drift of the market .",
    "the second is the random bulk @xmath17 @xmath54 which corresponds to random correlation between the different time series . in order to filter this noise",
    ", one must use random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite , to identify the random properties of empirical correlation matrices .",
    "the method define the modularity as @xmath55 constituted from the eigenvalues @xmath56 less than or equal to @xmath57 ( usually , the eigenvalues smaller than @xmath58 are included as well ) and their corresponding eigenvectors @xmath59 .",
    "the new method modified three popular community detection algorithms , customizing where necessary to be effective with correlation matrices @xcite .",
    "the three algorithms we use in this paper are known as the potts ( or spin glass ) method @xcite , the louvain method @xcite and the spectral method @xcite    99 s. sinha , a. chatterjee , a. chakraborti , and b.k.chakrabarti . _",
