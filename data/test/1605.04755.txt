    "generally speaking , we know that if the energy of a massive particle is sufficiently high , its predicted nonrelativistic quantum dynamics , as given by schrdinger equation , leads to inconsistent results . but to what extent ?",
    "can we quantify , or at least establish a lower bound for the lack of covariance of the schrdinger probability density ?",
    "of course , if one is capable of solving the appropriate relativistic equation , this can be done by direct comparison of measurable quantities in the two scenarios . however",
    ", this is often not the case .",
    "let us start by considering a somewhat deceptive example which , however , illustrates the kind of situation we intend to address .",
    "it involves the spreading of free wave packets and goes as follows : given that the particle s wave function is a gaussian with initial width @xmath0 at @xmath1 , for later times the width will be @xmath2 .",
    "if the particle s wave length is sufficiently small , @xmath3 , then we have @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "thus , we would have a finite probability to measure the particle in a position that would violate the postulates of special relativity . although there is nothing in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics that prevents this sort of unphysical prediction ,",
    "the reasoning is misleading .",
    "although the central region with characteristic scale @xmath0 presents the highest probability density , from the very beginning , the probability to find the particle at any region of space is nonvanishing , for the gaussian is nonzero everywhere .",
    "so , even if we measure the particle outside the light cone associated to the wave - packet _ centroid _ , one can always argue that there was a finite probability for the particle to `` be '' near the detection position all the time .",
    "it is clear from this example that a situation in which one can consistently evaluate to what extent special relativity is being violated by schrdinger dynamics should involve an initially confined system , so that the probability to measure the particle outside the confining region is rigorously null for @xmath1 , the confinement conditions posteriorly changing . confined quantum particles subjected to constraints that become time dependent have been studied in a variety of scenarios .",
    "perhaps the most widely known problem in this class is the fermi - ulam bouncer @xcite that concerns a particle that moves between two reflective walls , one of which is oscillating .",
    "here we are interested in models with one receding wall , as the ones addressed in @xcite in the one - dimensional case . in three dimensions there are solutions for expanding cylindrical @xcite and spherical @xcite wells . of course , if the moving wall has a velocity wich is smaller than the speed of light , then the boundary conditions themselves prevent schrdinger dynamics from predicting violations in local causality .",
    "but then , a wall moving at a superluminal velocity is a crying unphysical system .",
    "therefore , for our purposes , the most natural scenarios to address are those in which one of the walls is suddenly removed @xcite , as in the free expansion of a classical gas .",
    "we will consider these situations in detail in sec .",
    "let us define what we mean by a set of compatible light cones and then propose our quantifier as a probability of violation in local causality .",
    "let @xmath6 be a bounded region in @xmath7 ( the reasoning is the same for regions in @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 its outer boundary .",
    "assume that a quantum particle of mass @xmath11 is confined inside @xmath6 , @xmath10 corresponding to the walls of a rigid box .",
    "for simplicity , let us assume that the particle is in one of the stationary states of this infinite well , say , the fundamental state @xmath12 .",
    "now , let @xmath13 ) be a larger region in space bounded by @xmath14 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "next , consider that the wall @xmath10 is suddenly removed ( at @xmath1 ) .",
    "the wave function @xmath12 is no longer an eigenstate of the hamiltonian and , thus , will evolve according to its expansion in terms of the new eigenfunctions associated with the well delimited by @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , we get @xmath16 , where @xmath17 may denote a set of quantum numbers depending on the dimensionality of the system . this situation , as we will see ,",
    "leads to non - covariant results , since , in general , the previous summation includes modes of _ arbitrarily high momenta_.    we define @xmath18 as the points interior to the surface @xmath19 , which is built by the propagation of each point in @xmath10 in the local normal direction , with the speed of light , see fig . [ fig1](b ) .",
    "this definition is sufficient for smooth wells ( its generalization for wells containing corners is straightforward ) .",
    "note that , differently from @xmath10 , @xmath20 does not represent an actual physical constraint for @xmath21 , but only a reference surface .",
    "now one is in position to define the set of compatible light cones as the union of all future light cones referring to the space - time events @xmath22 which are interior to @xmath14 .",
    "we finally define the failure of the schrdinger wave function in delivering results compatible with relativistic causality at a time @xmath23 through the probability @xmath24 to measure the particle outside the set of compatible light cones .",
    "that is     part of the wave function is outside all possible time - like positions the particle could be measured on .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]   part of the wave function is outside all possible time - like positions the particle could be measured on .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is an element of volume .",
    "note that for @xmath1 , @xmath28 because @xmath29 vanishes in @xmath30 ( the set of all points the are in @xmath31 and not in @xmath6 ) .",
    "also , since @xmath31 is bounded , there exists a finite time , say @xmath32 , for which @xmath33 , leading to @xmath28 for @xmath34 [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ] .",
    "one important point , that must be clearly understood from the outset , is that there is no relation between genuine bell nonlocality ( which requires entanglement ) and the quantity in eq .",
    "( [ pv ] ) .",
    "while the former is a true physical effect , the latter is related to the error of schrdinger dynamics in relativistic situations due to its galilean covariance . in other words ,",
    "the probability @xmath24 gives a lower bound for the amount of _ fake _ nonlocality that arises in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "it is a lower bound because the part of the wave packet which is inside the set of compatible light cones not necessarily yields precise predictions on experimental results .",
    "however , for this part of the wave function at least local causality is preserved .",
    "in this work we will address what could be named `` the free expansion of a single particle in one dimension '' @xcite .",
    "it consists of the simplest instance of the general process described in the previous section .",
    "we consider a particle in an infinite one - dimensional well of width @xmath35 which , at @xmath1 , is released to expand within a larger well with size @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , in this case , @xmath6 and @xmath31 correspond to the intervals @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the boundary of @xmath6 is given by the two points @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , @xmath42 is the stationary solution for @xmath43 , while the basis in terms of which @xmath44 has to be decomposed for @xmath45 is @xmath46 the exact solution for the schrdinger dynamics of this problem appeared in this journal in 2008 @xcite .",
    "the wave function for an arbitrary time @xmath23 reads @xmath47 where the sum runs from @xmath48 to @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the revival time in the larger wall .",
    "as we will se , this is a relevant time scale in our analysis , especially due to the symmetry property @xcite : @xmath51      we are interested in situations where the particle s kinetic energy @xmath52 ( the energy of the fundamental state of the inner box ) is relevant in comparison to its rest energy @xmath53 .",
    "the relation between the initial size of the well and the particle s lorentz factor can be conveniently expressed as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the particle s compton wave length and @xmath56 is the velocity of a classical particle with kinetic energy @xmath57 [ @xmath58 . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show numerically calculated @xmath24 , eq .",
    "( [ pv ] ) , as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath59 for different system sizes .",

    "( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) the failure of galilean covariance to preserve local causality in quantum mechanics is very small , as can be seen in figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) .",
    "even for such a fast particle the chances that non - relativistic quantum mechanics would predict a violation in local causality is no larger than @xmath66 . as the size of the initial confinement region",
    "is decreased , @xmath24 starts to display a broad peak which is related to the initial , faster - than - light ballistic motion of the wave packet soon after the change in the boundary conditions .",
