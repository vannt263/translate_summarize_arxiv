    "i will often use that language here .",
    "the analogue in hydrodynamics is the mach cone .",
    "the future ( past ) light cone consists of the radially outward ( inward ) characteristics parameterized by @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "there is a 2-parameter set of characteristics through each point corresponding to the sphere of angular directions @xmath60 at that point .",
    "this leads to some arbitrariness in formulating an evolution algorithm for cauchy data based upon the method of characteristics .",
    "there are an infinite number of characteristics and associated propagation equations which can be used to evolve cauchy data from time @xmath54 to time @xmath61 .    for a practical numerical scheme ,",
    "it is thus necessary either to average these propagation equations appropriately over the sphere of characteristic directions at or select out some finite number of characteristics whose propagation equations comprise a nonredundant set .",
    "the latter approach has been successfully carried out by butler  @xcite .",
    "for the case of plane flow of an inviscid fluid ( a problem in two spatial dimensions ) , he formulates an algorithm based upon four `` preferred '' characteristics . in this problem ,",
    "the geometry is further complicated because the characteristics are dynamically dependent upon the fluid variables , in contrast to the essentially time independent characteristic cones of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cones ] ) . in the numerical scheme ,",
    "the characteristics must themselves be determined by some finite difference approximation .    that summarizes the cauchy problem and its solution by the method of characteristics .",
    "i now present a procedure which avoids the arbitrariness and awkwardness of the method of characteristics in a 3-dimensional cauchy evolution .",
    "it is based upon a characteristic initial value approach rather than a cauchy approach . in order to understand the distinction , it is essential to view space - time as 4-dimensional , with initial data given on a three - dimensional hypersurface . the cauchy approach is based upon evolution of initial data given on a spatial hypersurface in space - time , i.e. points of space at the same instant of time @xmath62 , to data at a later time @xmath63 . in the characteristic approach",
    ", data is initially posed on an outgoing characteristic cone ( light cone ) , which defines a hypersurface at constant retarded time @xmath64 .",
    "characteristic evolution then proceeds iteratively to characteristic cones @xmath65 .",
    "the numerical grid is intrinsically based upon these outgoing characteristic hypersurfaces .",
    "the algorithm for evolving from retarded time @xmath66 to @xmath67 is based upon characteristics which are uniquely and intrinsically picked out by the geometry of the retarded time hypersurfaces .",
    "this characteristic evolution procedure radically differs from cauchy evolution .",
    "it uses concepts developed in the 1960 s for studies of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "these were prompted by the inability of the major mathematical tools such as green s functions and fourier analysis to overcome the difficulties posed by nonlinearity of the equations and the ambiguity of the general coordinate freedom in the theory .",
    "its success later motivated a more extensive mathematical treatment of the characteristic initial value problem  @xcite .",
    "these new techniques were especially designed for investigation of gravitational waves .",
    "a computational algorithm based on this approach has been the most successful in simulating the production of gravitational waves from black holes .",
    "@xcite    the approach has two novel ingredients :    * the use of _ characteristic hypersurfaces _ to formulate a characteristic initial value problem ( civp ) and * the use of _ compactification methods _ to describe on a finite grid the waves propagating to infinity .",
    "_ characteristic hypersurfaces _ are 3-dimensional sets traced out in space - time by characteristic worldlines or , equivalently , by their wavefronts .",
    "they provide a natural coordinate system to describe waves  @xcite .",
    "it is very fruitful to use an initial value scheme which describes time evolution by means of the retarded time coordinate defined by characteristic hypersurfaces as a substitute for the familiar cauchy scheme based upon constant time hypersurfaces .",
    "as will be shown , this approach uses a completely different form of the mathematical equations and the free initial data .",
    "_ compactification methods _ provide a rigorous description of the radiation field of a source observed in the asymptotic limit of going to infinity along a characteristic worldline.@xcite .",
    "the key idea is to introduce a new coordinate which ranges over values from 0 to 1 as the actual distance from the source ranges from 0 to @xmath68 .",
    "the hyperbolic equations are rewritten in terms of these new coordinates .",
    "asymptotic behavior at the `` points at infinity '' can then be studied in terms of the new coordinate which ranges over finite values . in this way",
    ", the concept of the radiation zone as an _ asymptotic limit at infinity _ is given rigorous meaning .",
    "characteristic hypersurfaces are important here since waves travel to infinity along characteristic worldlines , not along cauchy hypersurfaces of constant time . even for field equations as complicated as those of general relativity , this procedure provides a finite geometrical description of waves travelling to infinity .",
    "the limit points at infinity form a boundary to the compactified space - time , which i will refer to as _ radiative infinity_. at a given retarded time , this boundary has the topology of a sphere , representing a sphere of observers at infinity .    it should be emphasized that _ radiative infinity _ differs drastically from _ spatial infinity _ ( the limit of going to infinity holding time constant ) .",
    "early considerations of compactifying infinite space for computational purposes were discarded because they were based upon spatial infinity  @xcite . an attempt to cover infinite space this way by a finite grid at constant time fails in a hyperbolic problem because there is necessarily an infinite physical distance between a grid point at infinity and its neighbors .",
    "this makes it impossible on a spatial grid at fixed time to resolve radiation with finite wave length which propagates to infinity .",
    "in contrast , for a grid constructed on a characteristic hypersurface , the grid points ride the wave without noticing its finite wavelength in the approach to radiative infinity .    in terms of characteristic",
    "coordinates @xmath69 and @xmath70 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1wav ] ) becomes @xmath71 here @xmath72 satisfies the propagation equation @xmath73 along the characteristics in the @xmath74-direction .",
    "this is the essence of how the use of characteristic coordinates simplifies the treatment of waves .",
    "these ideas provide the physical basis for a new computational algorithm  @xcite .",
    "i will illustrate how it applies to a nonlinear version of the wave equation in 3 spatial dimensions .",
    "however , this evolution algorithm can be taken over intact to other hyperbolic physical systems , including electromagnetic fields , the yang - mills gauge fields of elementary particle physics , as well as general relativity , because of the common mathematical structure of these theories as second differential order hyperbolic equations .",
    "although it has not been explored how this approach might be implemented in the case of a first differential order hyperbolic system , such as hydrodynamics , the general ideas should be applicable .",
    "as a simple illustration of the characteristic initial value problem , consider the nonlinear scalar wave equation ( swe ) in 3-spatial dimensions , which we write in spherical polar coordinates @xmath75 as @xmath76\\phi         = { 1 \\over c^2}\\partial_t^2 \\phi -{1 \\over r}\\partial_r^2 ( r \\phi )",

    "@xcite here i illustrate the application of ccm to the nonlinear wave equation ( [ eq : pde ] ) .",
    "this problem requires boundary conditions at infinity which ensure that the total energy and the energy loss due to radiation are both finite . in a 3-dimensional problem , these are the conditions responsible for the proper @xmath134 asymptotic decay of the radiation fields .",
    "however , for practical purposes , in the computational treatment of such a system by the cauchy problem , an outer boundary is artificially established at some large but finite distance .",
    "some condition is then imposed upon this boundary in an attempt to approximate the proper asymptotic behavior at infinity .",
    "such an artificial boundary condition ( abc ) typically causes partial reflection of the outgoing wave back into the system  @xcite , which contaminates the accuracy of the evolution and the radiated signal .",
    "furthermore , nonlinear wave equations often display backscattering so that it may not be correct to try to entirely eliminate incoming radiation from the numerical solution .",
    "the errors introduced by abc s are of an analytic origin , essentially independent of the computational discretization . in general , a systematic reduction of the error can only be achieved by simultaneously refining the grid and moving the computational boundary to a larger radius , which is computationally very expensive for three - dimensional simulations .",

    "have been proposed . for recent reviews ,",
    "see ref s . @xcite . during the last two decades ,",
    "local abc s in differential form have been extensively employed by several authors @xcite with varying success .",
    "some local abc s have been derived for the linear wave equation by considering the asymptotic behavior of outgoing solutions @xcite ; this approach may be regarded as a generalization of the sommerfeld outgoing radiation condition .",
    "although such abc s are relatively simple to implement and have a low computational cost , their final accuracy is often limited because their simplifying assumptions are rarely met in practice @xcite .",
    "systematic improvement of the accuracy of local abc s can only be achieved by moving the computational boundary to a larger radius .",
    "the disadvantages of local abc s have led to implementation of nonlocal abc s based on integral representations of the infinite domain problem @xcite . even for problems where the green s function is known and easily computed , such approaches were initially dismissed as impractical @xcite ; however , the rapid increase in computer power has made it possible to implement nonlocal abc s for the linear wave equation even in 3 space dimensions @xcite . for a linear problem , this can yield numerical solutions which converge to the exact infinite domain problem as the grid is refined , keeping the artificial boundary at a fixed distance .",
    "however , due to nonlocality , the computational cost per time step usually grows at a higher power of grid size ( @xmath135 per time step in a 3-dimensional problem with @xmath136 spatial grid points ) than in a local approach @xcite , which is demanding even for today s supercomputers .",

    "nonlinear problems are often treated by linearizing the governing equations in the far field , using either local or nonlocal linear abc s @xcite . besides introducing an approximation at the analytical level",
    ", this procedure requires that the artificial boundary be placed sufficiently far from the strong - field region , which sharply increases the computational cost in multidimensional simulations .",
    "there seems to be no currently available abc which is able to produce numerical solutions which converge ( as the discretization is refined ) to the infinite domain exact solution of a strongly nonlinear 3-dimensional wave problem , keeping the artificial boundary at a fixed location .    for such nonlinear problems",
    ", ccm produces an accurate solution out to radiative infinity with effort @xmath136 per time - step .",
    "ccm increases the total computational cost only by a factor @xmath137 with respect to a pure cauchy algorithm with a local abc .",
    "the use of numerical methods based upon matching a characteristic initial - value formulation and a cauchy formulation can effectively remove the above difficulties associated with a finite computational boundary .",
    "there is no need to truncate space - time at a finite distance from the sources , since compactification of the radial coordinate makes it possible to cover the whole space - time with a finite grid . in this way",
    ", the true radiation zone signal may be computed .",
    "although the characteristic formulation has stability limitations in interior region where the characteristic hypersurfaces can develop caustics , it proves to be both accurate and computationally efficient in the treatment of the exterior , caustic - free region .",
    "ccm is a new approach to global numerical evolution which is free of error at the analytic level .",
    "the characteristic algorithm provides the _",
    "boundary condition for the interior cauchy evolution , while the cauchy algorithm supplies the _ inner _ boundary condition for the characteristic evolution .",
    "since ccm consists of discretizing an exact analytic treatment of the radiation from source to radiative infinity , it generates numerical solutions which converge to the exact analytic solution of the radiating system even in the presence of strong nonlinearity .",
    "thus , any desired accuracy can be achieved by refining the grid , without moving the matching boundary . in practice",

    "normally a light cone keeps expanding forever .",
    "what makes a black hole light cone unique is that gravity halts this expansion and eventually the black hole just hovers in equilibrium at a fixed size .",
    "each point on the spherical black hole still moves along a light ray , but the sphere of light rays is in a delicate gravitational balance between growing and shrinking .",

    "the binary black holes , rather than initially forming as a point caustic in the schwarzschild case , form as a cross - over surface where light rays collide .",
