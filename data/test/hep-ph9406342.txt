    "the existence of some uncertainties both in the experimental and in the theoretical information concerning the form factors in the amplitudes of various pion decays [ 1 ] stimulated the development of a plethora of models for these processes .",
    "the most popular are the quark - loop models , whose central problem is the definition of the quark - meson coupling . in some of these models",
    "the quark - meson coupling is introduced via effective lagrangians and pcac [ 1,2,3 ] .",
    "these models have a hybrid character due to the simultaneous presence of quarks and mesons .",
    "more consistent than these models are those based on the bethe salpeter equation [ 4 ] , which assume that a meson is a bound state of a quark and an antiquark ; however , they have some defficiences related to the form of the interaction kernel , the validity of the instantaneous approximation and the appearance of the relative time variable .    recently , without defining any special binding mechanism , simple models of mesons , like products of free quark and antiquark states with a suitable relativistic coupling of the spins and a particular distribution of the relative momentum have been proposed [ 5 ] .",
    "horbatsch and koniuk went a step further by adding a gluon to the @xmath4 state [ 6 ] in order to incorporate some confining effects and possible gluon exchange .",
    "some time ago we also proposed [ 7 ] a form of this kind , but , instead of the gluon , we introduced a scalar vacuum - like field @xmath5 intended to represent globally the fluctuations of the quark - gluonic field which can not be described in terms of a few elementary excitations .",
    "apppearing under different names like condensates in the shifman , vainshtein and zakharov approach [ 8 ] , or bag in the the bag models [ 9 ] , nonelementary excitations have been formely introduced in many quark models . in deep inelastic processes",
    "[ 10 ] they got the name of sea , because they looks like a sea    of highly virtual particles which becomes a real source of new particles at high energy .",
    "the main point is that it is almost always necessary to consider besides the valence quarks some nonperturbative effects which are essential in the description of the binding and of the generation of new particles .    in the following section we present the particular features of the model and derive the expressions of the pion decay amplitudes .",
    "the comparison of our results with the experimental data is performed in section 3 . in section 4 our conclusions",
    "are presented .",
    "the appendix contains some useful notations and integrals used throughout the paper , as well as the expression of the partial width of the weak radiative decay and the inadvertencies found by us here .",
    "the model used for calculating the decay amplitudes is based on the following picture we have now for hadrons .",
    "hadrons look like bags , cavities or bubbles containing a few bound valence quarks in equilibrium with the excitation of the surrounding quark - gluonic field .",
    "the equilibrium is stable and the internal distribution of momenta does not change as long as the hadrons remain free . during the interaction , the equilibrium breaks down , the fluctuations of the quark - gluonic field become very intense and new states can emerge .",
    "a long experience proves that perturbation theory is unable to describe both the binding effects and the hadron interaction at low energy .",
    "this fact shows clearly that the fluctuations of the quark - gluonic field generating these effects are far from being elementary .",
    "for this reason we avoid considering some elementary excitations like a small number of quarks or gluons besides the valence quarks and introduce a phenomenological field @xmath5 to describe globally the fluctuations of the quark - gluonic field inside the hadrons .",
    "the field @xmath5 has the quantum numbers of the vacuum and carries its own momentum which is not subject of any mass shell constraint because @xmath5 does not represent an elementary excitation .",
    "also , in order to bypass the perturbative treatment of the interaction , we do not start from the elementary quark gluon coupling but we prefer looking to the time translation operators , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are more appropiate in a phenomenological , nonperturbative approach .",
    "we describe by @xmath6 and @xmath7 the modifications produced in the structure of the free hadronic states by an external interaction .    in the cases studied in this paper ,",
    "the pion is the single hadron involved and nothing can change its structure up to the emission of a weak or electromagnetic quanta .",
    "therefore , the time translation operator @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the momentum of the first emission , acting on the single pion state leaves it unchanged since there was no external interaction to perturbe the internal equilibrium .    in the case of",
    "the radiative decays , the emission of the second quanta takes place in a state already perturbed by the recoil of the first emission . due to the smalness of the involved momenta",
    ", we assume however , that the perturbation of the equilibrium state can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the time translation operator @xmath9 , describing the effect of the quantum fluctuations in the time interval between the two emissions will also be approximated by unity .    according to the ideas outlined above , we propose the following expression for the @xmath0-meson state :    @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the creation operators of the valence quark and antiquark",
    "whose colour , spin and flavour are denoted by the collective indices @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the quark creation and",
    "annihilation operators satisfy the free field canonical anticommutation relations , the only nonvanishing being @xmath16_+= \\left [ b^+_\\alpha({\\bf p } ) , b_\\beta({\\bf q})\\right]_+= ( 2\\pi)^3 { e\\over m}\\delta^{(3)}({\\bf p } - { \\bf q } ) \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}. \\eqno(2)\\ ] ] @xmath17 denotes the creation of a nonelementary excitation having the internal quantum numbers of the vacuum and carrying the momentum @xmath18 .",
    "it represents the quantum fluctuations of the quark gluonic - field in equilibrium with the valence quarks.it is an independent component of the pion wave function and hence it is supposed to commute with the quark operators .",
    "the physical meaning of the phenomenological field @xmath19 allows us to assume that @xmath20    in the same time , keeping into account that in any process the conservation of the quark momentum is ensured by the commutation relations ( 2 ) and that @xmath21 is an independent component of the hadrons , one must impose from outside the separate conservation of its 4-momentum .",
    "we assume then @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant having the dimension of mass introduced for dimensional reasons .",
    "the binding effects in the expression ( 1 ) of the pion state are introduced by means of the internal wave function @xmath24 which must cut off the large relative momenta in order to allow the fulfilment of the orthogonality relation @xmath25 the factor @xmath26 in equation ( 5 ) is due to the equation ( 4 ) following from the nonelementary character of the phenomenological field @xmath5.it forces us to modify the phase space density as it follows @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the probability distribution of the pion mass around a central value @xmath29 . if @xmath28 has a small width , like in our case , the integral over m can be performed from the beginning and one can return to the old phase space density .",
    "we pass now to the calculation of the pion decay amplitudes .",
    "@xmath30    in the lowest order of the weak interaction , the @xmath31 matrix element of pion decay into leptons is @xmath32 where the weak hamiltonian @xmath33 @xmath34 is written in the limit of local quark - lepton interaction.in equation ( 8) @xmath35 is the fermi constant , @xmath36 is the cabibbo angle , @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the up and down quark fields and @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the lepton fields .",
    "the time translation operators @xmath41 , @xmath42 in equation @xmath43 represent the global effect of the quantum fluctuations due to some strong external interactions which are absent both in the single pion and in the final state where only leptons are present.then , as we have already mentioned above , it follows that the time translation operators @xmath41 , and @xmath44 in equation @xmath43 can be replaced by unity .    after introducing in equation ( 7 ) the plane wave decomposition of the free fields ( a1,a2 ) , the expression ( 7 ) of the @xmath31 matrix element can be written as it follows @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the dirac spinors for the leptons .",
    "the matrix element of the quark current in equation ( 9 ) is calculated using the expression ( 1 ) of the pion state.one gets easily @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 .    in equation",
    "( 10 ) , the condition ( 4 ) has been used.in this case it means that the annihilation of the valence quark and antiquark of the pion into leptons proceeds in a `` bare '' state , i.e. in the absence of other excitations of the quark - gluonic field described by the phenomenological field @xmath5 .",
    "using the definition of the pion decay constant @xmath55 , ( a6 ) , one gets from equation ( 10 ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and @xmath58~[1-{(m_u - m_d)^2\\over m^2}]}$ ] .",
    "the factor 3 in equation ( 11 ) is due to the quantum number of colour and is present whenever one encounters a quark loop .",
    "it is worth noticing that equation ( 10 ) looks like those appearing in other quark loop models , with the difference that the spin projectors are replaced there by propagators . in our model",
    "the valence quark and antiquark are real , on mass shell particles and , because of this fact , the integral over their momenta in equation ( 10 ) leads to the finite result ( 11 ) .",
    "this is an essential difference between the present model and other quark loop models [ 2 ] , where @xmath59 is infinite and hence can not be calculated directly in the absence of a consistent renormalization procedure .",
    "proceeding in the same manner , we calculate the neutral pion constant @xmath60 defined by ( a5 ) and obtain @xmath61 where @xmath62    obviously , the values of @xmath63 and @xmath60 coincide in the limit of equal quark masses .",
    "we associate the diagram in fig . 1 to the expression of the matrix element ( 10 ) .",
    "it is important to notice that in our diagram the quark lines correspond to projectors on the states of positive and negative energy , not to propagators like in most quark - loop models [ 2 ] .    _",
    "@xmath64    in the lowest order of perturbation with respect to the weak and electromagnetic interactions , the element of the @xmath31 matrix corresponding to the decay of the positive charged pion can be written @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 where the electromagnetic hamiltonian is @xmath68 @xmath69~a^\\lambda(x)\\eqno(14)\\ ] ] and @xmath70 denote the quark charges .",
    "then , just like in @xmath71 case , the time translation operators @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be replaced by unity.we also replace by unity the operators @xmath74 and @xmath75 because the perturbation produced in the equilibrium state by the emission of a quanta can be neglected , as outlined in the introduction , due to the smalness of the involved momenta .",
    "we shall comment more about this approximation in the last section .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath31 matrix element proceeds then as usually , leading to the following expression : @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78g^{\\mu\\nu } \\eqno(15)\\ ] ] where the first term is called the bremsstrahlung term and the second one -the structure dependent term.the first one describes the emission of the photon by the charged lepton , while the second one describes the emission of the photon by the meson itself .    after using wick s theorem to pass from time ordered to normal ordered products of quark operators , we can write the matrix elements involving two currents in equation ( 15 ) in the following manner @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87\\ .\\right . \\eqno(17)\\ ] ] the bremsstrahlung and the structure dependent terms can be represented diagramatically like in figures ( 2a ) and ( 2b ) .    after performing the integrals over the spatial coordinates and over the internal momenta ( a10,a11,a15,a20 ) in equations ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 17 )",

    "this result is a direct consequence of the consistent treatment of the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "it is also important to notice that , contrary to the current opinion , our form factors ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) depend essentially on the photon energy .",
    "both of them have poles at @xmath105 , i.e. at vanishing photon energy , which lead to an infrared divergence in the axial contribution to the decay width .",
    "although this fact is not surprising since it appears in the bremsstrahlung part too , it requires a careful analysis of the soft photon limit , which is beyond our purpose now .",
    "@xmath106    the calculation of the neutral pion decay amplitude can be treated in the same manner we did in the case of weak radiative decay of the charged pion .",
    "then , just like in that case , one has @xmath107",

    "writing the @xmath31 matrix element of the neutral pion decay into its usual form @xmath116 and performing the trace and the integration over the spatial coordinates and internal momenta , one gets from ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) @xmath117 \\eqno(23)\\ ] ] where @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "as it can be seen from the relations ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) and ( 23 ) , the expressions obtained for @xmath55,@xmath60,@xmath96,@xmath95 and @xmath120 depend on the quark masses and on the value of the internal wave function in a given point @xmath121.in order to reduce as much as possible the dependence on the particular form of the internal function , we shall consider the ratios @xmath122,@xmath123,@xmath124 , @xmath125 which are functions of the quark masses only , to be compared with the experimental values .",
    "we recall that , contrary to most quark loop models , in our case the valence quarks are real , on mass shell particles and their momenta must fulfill the condition @xmath126 , which is impossible to be satisfied by the constituent quarks .",
    "we try therefore to fit the experimental data with current quark masses and analyse our results in the range of masses @xmath127 , @xmath128 as quoted in particle data [ 10 ]",
    ".    first we consider the function    @xmath129 and plot its contour lines in this domain ( fig.3a ) .",
    "the plot shows a very quick variation of @xmath130 over the mass range .",
    "it also shows that there is a continuous sequence of masses with @xmath131 leading to a perfect agreement between our result and the experimental one .    as concerns the form factors occuring in the weak radiative decay",
    ", we notice that one can not perform a direct comparison with the experimental values because , as pointed above , in our case the form factors @xmath95 and @xmath96 depend significantly on the photon energy , while the experimental data [ 11,12 ] have been fitted with some constant values .",
    "however , in order to test the predictive power of the model , we treat these constant values like mean values of the form factors over the space region where the measurements have been made .",
    "accordingly , we have to compare @xmath132 with @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the mean value of @xmath135 over the phase space region .",
    "since there are two different kinematical weights @xmath136 and @xmath137 given by the equations ( a26 ) and ( a27 ) which correspond to the left and right photons , one can define two mean values @xmath138 and @xmath139 : @xmath140 where @xmath141 [ 1 ] , @xmath142 and @xmath143 are given in the appendix and @xmath144 is the volume in phase space . following v. n. bolotov et al .",
    "[ 12 ] , we choose @xmath145 with @xmath146 and find that @xmath147 .",
    "in fig.3b we ploted the contur lines of the function @xmath148    @xmath149 .",
    "just like in @xmath130 case one observes a very quick variation over the quark mass range .",
    "also , for @xmath150 one finds @xmath151 which represents a quite good agreement with the values quoted for @xmath95 [ 11 ] .",
    "we try the same procedure for the axial form factor but in this case the comparison is not so relevant because of the existence of two contributions to the axial form factor : one with a simple pole and the other with a double pole at @xmath105 . defining as above @xmath152 and @xmath153 we find @xmath154 for the volume @xmath144 .",
    "as it can be seen from figs.3c and 3d , the values of @xmath155 and @xmath156 are rather large for the quark masses in the above range , where the agreement is reasonable in the previous cases .",
    "it follows then that it is very hard to reach a small mean value for @xmath157 as quoted in particle data [ 11 ] , unless there is an almost perfect compensation of the two contributions which are of different signs .",
    "the compensation would roughly occur for @xmath158 , but , as it can be seen from fig.3e , the function    @xmath159 does not reach this value in the above range of current quark masses .",
    "then the difference between our prediction and the experimental value of @xmath96 can not be reduced under an order of magnitude , which is quite bad .",
    "the model presented in this paper has some attractive features when compared with other quark models for pion decays .",
    "it is essentially relativistic and allows the consistent treatment of the pion structure and of the electromagnetic interaction , leading to manifest gauge invariant amplitudes for radiative decays .",
    "it also leads to finite expressions for the pion decay constants @xmath55 and @xmath60 which could in principle be compared with the experimental values .",
    "however , taking into account their dependence on the internal wave function which could in principle be different in the two cases , a comparison between @xmath55 and @xmath60 is not relevant for the predictive power of the model .",
    "the dependence of the results on the particular internal function of the pion is significantly reduced by considering the ratios @xmath160 which are functions on the quark masses only .",
    "the first of these ratios is in agreement with the experimental value for current quark masses in the range quoted in particle data [ 11 ] . as concerns the other two ratios ,",
    "a significant comparison would require some information about the eventual dependence of the form factors on the photon energy . in this sense ,",
    "a new fit of the measurements with @xmath161 dependent form factors including also the interference term which was neglected up to now , would be most interesting and could possibly remove the uncertainty in the quoted value of @xmath96 [ 12 ] .    in the preceding section we pointed out a very quick variation of @xmath162 and of @xmath163 in the region of masses selected for the best fit due to the presence in the expressions ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) of logarithms of nearly zero arguments .",
    "it must be however stressed that this fit can not be used for the precise determination of current quark masses without a quantitative analysis of the recoil effects on the internal equilibrium in the quark system after the first emission of a quanta .",
    "the last comment concerns the infrared behaviour of the form factors . as it can be seen from the appendix , only the axial contribution to the structure dependent",
    "part leads to an infrared catastrophe , i.e. to a divergence in the expression of the decay width .",
    "according to the standard procedure used in quantum electrodynamics , the infinities of this kind in the cross section are eliminated by compensation with those appearing in the interference term between the amplitude with radiative corrections and without them [ 14,15 ] . in our case",
    "this compensation mechanism does not work because of the particular form of the decay amplitude .",
    "the problem deserves a further study following closely the arguments of bloch and nordsieck [ 16 ] which are more appropriate in this case .",
    "appendix          using the criterion of covariance we write the integrals @xmath179 as it follows @xmath180 we observe that @xmath181 @xmath182 and obtain @xmath183 in a similar way , using covariance , one has @xmath184 and , proceeding as above , one gets for @xmath185 @xmath186 @xmath187 @xmath188 we solve the above system and write the integrals @xmath189 as it follows @xmath190 @xmath191 \\ { k_\\mu\\over\\omega}{k_\\nu\\over\\omega}.\\eqno(a20)\\ ] ] _ c _ ) .",
