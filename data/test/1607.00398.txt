    "@xcite , where the authors considered the appearance of stationary points in @xmath58 modified gravity theories . as shown in this works , the inclusion of an infinity number of terms in the power series , together with the requirement of maximal flatness , translates into the appearance of a starobinsky - like potential with exponentially suppressed corrections and into a displacement of the saddle point towards @xmath59 . in the large @xmath17 limit , both @xmath7 and the scalar theory",
    "give rise asymptotically flat einstein frame potentials .",
    "note however that the scalar sector generates a different einstein frame potential than the one obtained by requiring extreme flatness in @xmath7 . in the @xmath7 approach ,",
    "it is not possible to write the ricci scalar as an analytical function of the scalaron field .",
    "the einstein frame potential can be expressed only as a function of @xmath60 .",
    "the supergravity embeddings considered in ref .",
    "@xcite may lead to non - canonical kinetic terms for the scalar field playing the role of the inflaton .",
    "the associated einstein - frame lagrangian density reads @xmath61 with @xmath2 a free parameter taking any positive value . in order to obtain a canonically normalized kinetic term",
    "one can perform the field redefinition @xmath62 as a function of the new field , the potential stretches around the pole in and becomes _ locally _ flat . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , this interesting property can be extended to higher order poles and to models containing more than one scalar field .",
    "the basic assumption about the potential is that it is must be a regular function of @xmath63 around the pole .",
    "something similar happen in our case .",
    "for seeing this explicitly , consider the field redefinition @xmath64 this field transformation gives rise to the following kinetic term for the @xmath15 function , which plays now the role of the inflaton , @xmath65 as in eq .",
    ", the denominator of this expression contains a pole of order @xmath66 which stretches the potential for the canonically normalized field @xmath3 .",
    "this stretching is localized in the vicinity of @xmath67 which is precisely the value of @xmath15 at the stationary point @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath68 , see eq .  .",
    "the stretching of the potential around the pole is therefore equivalent to the existence of a stationary point in @xmath24 . in both cases ,",
    "the shape of the potential is irrelevant as long as it is regular and positive in the vicinity of the pole / stationary point .",
    "exponentially flat potentials appear when the pole in eq .",
    "is quadratic , i.e. in the @xmath69 limit . in order to employ that limit",
    ", the function @xmath24 must be well defined , which is not guaranteed for a general @xmath28 . among the cases and ,",
    "the particular choice that provides us with a finite and regular @xmath24 at @xmath69 is @xmath70 . in this case , eq .",
    "becomes @xmath71 which is very similar to the kinetic term of the @xmath2-attractors . to obtain the form appearing in this equation",
    "it is enough to perform an additional field redefinition @xmath72 since we have not assumed much about @xmath73 , we can still keep it as a general function of @xmath63 after this change of variables .",
    "note that the equivalence between the appearance of poles of kinetic terms and the flatness of the potential in terms of a canonically normalized field has been also analysed in ref .",
    "nevertheless , the approach presented here is significantly different .",
    "in particular , we took a model building perspective based on the existence of a multi - stationary point able to ensure the flatness of the potential rather than invoking a particular pole structure on the kinetic terms .",
    "in this paper we considered a general scalar potential @xmath13 with @xmath74 . by requiring the existence of the @xmath1-order stationary point at a field value @xmath14",
    ", we obtained a specific form for @xmath24 containing three free parameters @xmath23 , @xmath26 and @xmath17 .",
    "we showed that around the stationary point @xmath21 , the inflationary potential is flat and suitable for inflation provided that @xmath75 .",
    "nevertheless not all of the resulting flat potentials allow for a graceful inflationary exit .",
    "the relation between our results and the theory of @xmath2-attractors was also considered .",
    "we explicitly showed that using @xmath15 as a scalar field it is possible to obtain a non - canonical kinetic term , which after a trivial field redefinition , takes the form of the @xmath2-attractor kinetic term .",
    "there is therefore a deep connection between the two approaches : asking for the existence of a stationary point in a scalar potential with canonical kinetic term is equivalent to ask for the existence of a kinetic term with a pole .",
    "both formulations leads to flat regions within general potentials which can be responsible for inflation .",
