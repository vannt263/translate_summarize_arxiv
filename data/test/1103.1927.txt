    "under the unified scheme of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , seyfert 1 nuclei with broad line regions ( blrs ) would be classified as seyfert 2 if the blrs were obscured by encircling dust tori [ 1 ] . as nearly all of the parsec - sized dust tori can not be spatially resolved ( note that jaffe et al . reported interferometric mid - infrared observations that spatially resolve the dust torus in ngc 1068 [ 2 ] ) , the size and geometry of torus are not well understood .",
    "recent researches measured the inner radius of dust torus by observing the time - delayed responses of the @xmath2 band flux variations to the @xmath1 band flux variations , as the bulk of the @xmath2 band flux should originate in the thermal radiation of hot dust surrounding the central engine [ 3,4,5 ] .",
    "the iron k@xmath0 emission line at @xmath4 6.4 kev was first identified as a common feature in the x - ray spectrum of agns by _ ginga _ [ 6,7 ] .",
    "the line can be promptly interpreted as fluorescence emission following photoelectric absorption of the hard x - ray continuum [ 8 ] .",
    "recent _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations revealed narrow ( unresolved by _ xmm _ ) iron k@xmath0 lines at @xmath4 6.4 kev in the x - ray spectra of most agns [ 9,10,11 ] however , the origin of the narrow iron k@xmath0 line is still poorly understood .",
    "possible origins of the narrow line include the outermost regions of the accretion disk , the blr , and the dust torus .",
    "nandra found that the average fe k@xmath0 core emission width in a sample of type 1 agns is about a factor of two narrower than the broad emission line width ( specifically h@xmath5 ) , and there is no correlation between them [ 12 ] .",
    "this suggests that the iron k@xmath0 emission lines are likely , in many cases , originated in the torus at larger scales but not the blrs .",
    "reverberation mapping [ 13,14 ] of blrs is one of few methods that can directly derive the masses of super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) in agns . in tracing the response of the gas in blrs to the variable ionizing continuum of agns , the time delay between the variations in the continuum and the broad emission lines",
    "gives a characteristic radius of the blr gas . with the orbital velocity estimate based on the width of the broad emission line",
    ", the black hole masses can be derived as : @xmath6 the scaling factor @xmath7 is determined by the geometry and velocity distribution of the blr gas .",
    "one of the uncertainties in this technique is that the geometry and velocity distribution of the blr is unknown , and independent techniques are required to test and calibrate the derived black hole masses .",
    "another technique to weigh smbhs in agns is based on the tight relationship between the smbh mass and the velocity dispersion of the bulge or spheroid [ 15,16 ] .",
    "the @xmath8 relationship was primarily discovered in quiescent galaxies ; however , recent studies have suggested that active smbhs have the same correlation [ 17,18,19 ] .    in this paper",
    "we compare the virial products of the infrared time lags and the narrow fe k@xmath0 widths for 10 type 1 agns with the black hole masses from other techniques .",
    "such study can put strong constraints on the origin of the narrow fe k@xmath0 line .",
    "we search for archival _ chandra _ hetg observations for agns , as _ chandra _ is the only instrument currently capable of resolving narrow iron k@xmath0 lines .",
    "we only choose the objects with narrow fe k@xmath0 lines detected at a confidence level @xmath9 3 @xmath10 .",
    "we also restrict our sample with blr reverberation mapping data available .",
    "the resulting sample consists of ten seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "all the archival _ chandra _ hetg observations of these agns are listed in table 1 .",
    "the process of data reduction and spectrum fitting is described in [ 11 ] . to improve the measurement of line widths , for sources with more than one hetg exposure",
    ", we fitted multiple spectra simultaneously with invariable line center energy and fwhm .",
    "the fitting results are shown in table 2 .    from literature ,",
    "we find infrared time lags for six of the sources ( see table 2 ) . from fig .",
    "30 in [ 4 ] , we see a tight correlation between the infrared lag and the @xmath1 band luminosity , with a scatter of 0.2 dex .",
    "such a relationship was adopted to estimate the infrared lags for the remaining four sources without infrared reverberation mapping observations in our sample .",
    "peterson et al . presented black hole masses for 35 agns based on broad emission - line reverberation mapping data [ 20 ] .",
    "the black hole masses are derived as @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( the scaling factor for blr reverberation mapping ) is a zero - point calibration determined using the @xmath8 relationship [ 19,24,25 ] .    since the narrow fe k@xmath0 line",
    "is always modeled by a single gaussian component , in this research we calculate the virial products as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the scaling factor , @xmath15 the infrared lag and @xmath16 the fwhm of the narrow iron k@xmath0 line . for a gaussian , fwhm/@xmath17 .",
    "note although the fe k@xmath0 line consists of two components ( k@xmath18 and k@xmath19 ) , with the spectral resolution of the hetg , its impact on the measurement of the line width with a single gaussian is negligible [ 26 ] .    as shown in figure 1 , nine of the derived @xmath20s are consistent with @xmath21s , but a scaling factor is required . the solid line is the best - fit line ( slope fixed to 1 ) for all ten sources , derived using the orthogonal regression program gaussfit ( version 3.55 ; [ 27 ] ) .",
    "the asymmetric statistical errors in the masses were symmetrized as the mean of the positive and negative errors since gaussfit can not work with asymmetric errors .",
    "the best - fit scaling factor @xmath14 is @xmath22 . while excluding the outlier ngc 5548",
    ", the best - fit value is @xmath23 .",
    "however , we note the correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is insignificant . the spearman s correlation test yields a confidence level of only 86.5% ( rho = 0.528 ) , even after excluding ngc 5548 .    in figure 2 , @xmath20/@xmath14 is plotted versus @xmath24 for seven sources with @xmath24 available in literature ( see table 2 ) .",
    "a best - fit was made to the filled points @xmath25 where we adopt @xmath0 = @xmath26 and @xmath5 = 4.02 as reported by tremaine et al .",
    "for quiescent galaxies [ 28 ] . the best - fit yields a scaling factor @xmath14 of @xmath27 . while excluding ngc 5548 , we obtained @xmath28 , and a confidence of the correlation of 83.3% ( spearman s rho = 0.617 ) .",
    "assuming a torus origin of the narrow fe k@xmath0 line , we obtained the virial products of the narrow iron k@xmath0 widths and the infrared time lags for 10 seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "we found nine out of ten derived virial masses were consistent with those masses measured based on reverberation mapping of optical broad emission lines [ 20 ] ; however , a scaling factor @xmath29 is required . for seven sources with @xmath30 measurements ,",
    "six of them showed virial masses consistent with the m-@xmath30 relationship , assuming a similar scaling factor @xmath29 .",
    "the most common assumption for converting a virial product to @xmath31 is : @xmath32 which implicitly assumes an isotropic velocity distribution [ 29 ] .",
    "the scaling factor we obtained indicates that the narrow fe k@xmath0 core is in average 2.6@xmath3 times broader than expected assuming an isotropic velocity distribution of the torus at the distance measured by the infrared lags .",
    "one possible explanation is that the narrow iron k@xmath0 line originates from smaller radius than the infrared radiation does .",
    "for instance , the obscuring torus might span a large range of scale ; the narrow iron k@xmath0 line originates from a smaller scale where the temperature is too high and dust does not exist , while the infrared radiation comes from a larger scale with lower temperatures .",
    "alternatively , the narrow iron k@xmath0 line might be contaminated by the blr / disk component , thus causing the line width of the torus component to be overestimated .",
    "if this is true , we would expect a variation of the narrow fe k@xmath0 line at time scales @xmath4 6.8 times smaller than the infrared lags .",
    "we note rapid variations of the narrow fe k@xmath0 line has been reported in ngc 7314 [ 30 ] and mrk 841 [ 31 ] but not detected in other sources .",
    "another possibility is that the velocity distribution for dust torus might not be virial . here",
    ", we consider the dust torus as a thick disk [ 32 ] .",
    "the thick disk would be sustained vertically by a pressure which is most probably provided by turbulence with a characteristic velocity @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the radius from the central black hole at the equator and @xmath35 is the local keplerian velocity at @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the observed value of @xmath16 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the inclination of the equator to our line of sight .",
    "the observed mass ( virial product without any scaling factor ) is : @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 hence , @xmath41 the observed ratio of seyfert 2 to seyfert 1 galaxies of about 4 [ 33 ] would imply a relative torus thickness of @xmath42 , if the distinction is solely due to the orientation of the torus .",
    "thus a scaling factor @xmath43 1 is plausible under this scheme .",
    "it is also clear from the last equation that @xmath14 is less sensitive to the inclination for h / r @xmath9 1 .",
    "this suggests that if this model for the narrow fe k@xmath0 line can be confirmed , the narrow fe k@xmath0 line could be used as a good tool to weigh the central smbh since it is insensitive to the inclination .    in both fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 , the only outlier ngc 5548 shows an relatively underestimated @xmath44 .",
    "cackett & horne analyzed 13 years results of optical spectrophotometric monitoring of the ngc5548 and gave a luminosity - dependent model of blrs to explain the variable width of h@xmath5 lines and its variable time - delayed lags [ 34 ] .",
    "it is possible that the size of torus also varies with luminosity in this source .",
    "we note that the narrow iron k@xmath0 line width varied significantly between two individual exposures ; from @xmath45 km s@xmath46 in 2000 to @xmath47 km s@xmath46 in 2002 .",
    "the line intensity also decreased from @xmath48 photons @xmath49 s@xmath46 to @xmath50 photons @xmath49 s@xmath46 . meanwhile",
    "the continuum luminosity ( 2.0  10.0 kev ) increased from @xmath51 ergs s@xmath46 to @xmath52 ergs s@xmath46 .",
    "this suggests a variable origin of the narrow iron k@xmath0 line .",
    "the line width presented in table 2 is dominated by the second observation with longer exposure time .",
    "if simply taking the line width from the first exposure , we can obtain a black hole mass four times higher , well consistent with the best - fit lines in fig . 1 and 2 .",
    "for the remaining sources with multiple available hetg exposures , no narrow iron k@xmath0 line variation was found to be significant .    while the correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is statistically insignificant ( at a confidence level of 87% excluding ngc 5548 ) , we argue that this may be attributed to the large uncertainties in the measurements of @xmath20 because of the large errorbars in the iron k line widths . in fig . 1 and 2",
    "we can see that the large scattering of data points from the best - fit lines are mainly due to the large uncertainties in the measurements of iron k@xmath0 line width . the scattering of data points in fig .",
    "1 can be measured by the standard deviation of log(@xmath53 ) , which is 0.50 for ten sources and 0.38 with ngc 5548 excluded .",
    "this is comparable to the typical 1@xmath10 uncertainty of log(@xmath54 ) which is @xmath4 0.35 .    to verify the reliability of this new technique",
    "to weigh smbh , more data points and better measurements of iron k@xmath0 line widths are required .",
    "given the difficulty in obtaining lengthily hetg observations with the required s / n to constrain the iron line width , we have to await the next generation of x - ray observatories that are able to measure the iron k line at higher spectral resolutions ( i.e. of the order 100 km / s ) with calorimeter - based detectors . before that",
    ", we need future x - ray observations to verify the origins of the narrow iron k@xmath0 line by better resolving the line profile and x - ray reverberation - mapping .    the work is supported by the chinese nsf through nsfc10773010 and nsfc 10825312 .",
