    "field theoretical models in external electromagnetic fields are of great interest and have attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "they are relevant to the study of many physical systems whose properties depend on the effects produced by external fields , especially when such effects are non - perturbative in nature .",
    "a particular example of such a situation is the so - called magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite ( see also @xcite for some earlier studies ) which has many potential applications in condensed matter physics @xcite and in studies of the early universe @xcite",
    ".    it is well known that a sufficiently strong attractive interaction between massless fermions can result in a chiral symmetry breaking condensate and a dynamically generated fermion mass . in the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , for example , this occurs when the interaction strength is at a particular large critical value .",
    "it is also now known that the presence of an external magnetic field can be a strong catalyst for this effect , leading in some cases to the generation of a dynamical mass for fermions even by very weak attractive interactions .",
    "for example , in an external magnetic field , the critical value of the njl coupling is reduced to zero .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that this magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking is a rather universal phenomenon and that its main features are model independent .",
    "the arguments were based on the observation that the effect is primarily due to the dynamics of the fermions from the lowest landau level which are gapless and should therefore dominate the behavior of the system at long wavelengths .    in this paper",
    "we will develop this idea further .",
    "we shall investigate the low - energy dynamics of chirally symmetric models with a short range interaction in an external magnetic field .",
    "the idea is to construct an effective action for the low energy degrees of freedom . in strong external magnetic fields ,",
    "these are the modes of charged particles in the lowest landau level . in the absence of interactions ,",
    "their effective dynamics is described by a field theory whose dimensionality is two less than the spacetime dimension .",
    "we shall take the hypothesis that , at least for strong magnetic fields and short ranged interactions , the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking can be understood in the lower dimensional effective theory .    as an illustration",
    ", we shall argue that this assumption is very natural in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "there , the modes of the lowest landau level are non - propagating , and in the absence of interactions , the ground state is highly degenerate and contains both chirally symmetric and chirally non - symmetric states .",
    "interactions , even with infinitesimally small coupling constants , will split this degeneracy , and whether chiral symmetry breaking occurs or not depends on whether the interaction favors the chirally non - symmetric or chirally symmetric ground states .",
    "one by - product of our analysis will be the fact that the dynamical generation of parity violating masses seems to be suppressed by magnetic fields .    in the more complicated case of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory",
    ", we shall argue that the infrared dynamics is governed by an effective ( 1 + 1)-dimensional gross - neveu like theory with an infinite number of flavors of fermions .",
    "we derive the most general low energy effective action which is compatible with the symmetries of the four dimensional theory .",
    "we then study the resulting model using the renormalization group .",
    "we will present a plausible argument for our main conclusion : that the presence of chiral symmetry breaking depends crucially on the sign ( but not the magnitude ) of one particular moment of the coupling constants which we denote by @xmath0 .",
    "if it is of the appropriate sign , its infrared renormalization group flow is to strong coupling and chiral symmetry is broken . with",
    "the other sign it flows to zero coupling and chiral symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "consider a system of relativistic ( 2 + 1)-dimensional fermions with the dirac hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the covariant derivative and @xmath3 are the first two pauli matrices .",
    "this hamiltonian is obtained in the continuum limit of some tight - binding lattice models relevant to condensed matter physics  on a square lattice with half of a quantum of magnetic flux through each plaquette ( see @xcite and references therein ) or on a honeycomb lattice without a magnetic field @xcite.it has also been discussed in the context of the continuum limit of the _ d_-wave state of high @xmath4 superconductors @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 commutes with any linear combination of the matrices @xmath6 which generate the lie algebra of a @xmath7 flavor symmetry which we will call chiral symmetry .",
    "possible mass terms which can be added to @xmath5 must be matrices which anti - commute with it .",
    "the basic matrix which anti - commutes with @xmath5 and which commutes with all of the flavor generators is @xmath8 and a mass term which one could add to @xmath5 which would preserve the flavor symmetry is @xmath9 .",
    "generally , in 2 + 1 dimensions , fermion mass terms violate parity symmetry . a parity transformation which is a symmetry of the massless dirac equation @xmath10 and which commutes with the flavor symmetry generators @xmath11 is @xmath12 the mass term @xmath9 is odd under this transformation and it would therefore violate parity symmetry .",
    "more generally , all mass terms of the form @xmath13 are odd under the parity defined in eq .",
    "( [ pparity ] ) .",
    "moreover , there is no modification of the parity transformation which would make the mass @xmath9 parity symmetric .",
    "it is possible to get a parity invariant mass by breaking the flavor symmetry . for this",
    ", we must define parity as a combination of the transformation ( [ pparity ] ) and a discrete flavor transformation , for example , @xmath14 this is a symmetry of @xmath5 and it also commutes with the mass term @xmath15 .",
    "this mass term breaks the @xmath7 flavor symmetry to @xmath16 .",

    "this fact depends only on the total magnetic flux and is independent of the profile of the magnetic field .",
    "the result , which we have found by explicit computation , is also a result of the atiyah - singer index theorem generalized to open spaces@xcite .",

    "all negative energy states of the fermions are full and all positive energy states are empty . for overall charge neutrality , half of the fermion zero modes must be occupied  but the occupation of zero modes is otherwise unconstrained .",

    "first of all , this means that in a magnetic field the expectation value of the parity violating mass operator vanishes , @xmath57 regardless of the occupation of zero modes . this has the implication that external magnetic fields do not enhance the generation of parity violating mass terms .",

    "however , this does not mean that chiral symmetry is necessarily broken .",
    "it only implies that the ground state is degenerate and there are chirally non - symmetric ground states which are degenerate with chirally symmetric ones .",
    "if there are additional weak interactions , of course , the correct ground state should be found by resolving the degeneracy using degenerate perturbation theory . in this case , all that is required to break chiral symmetry is an interaction which favors a chirally non - symmetric population of the zero modes .    if the interaction favors the breaking of chiral symmetry , symmetry breaking occurs for even an infinitesimal value of its coupling constant .",
    "this is the reason why the critical value of the interaction can be at zero coupling in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "in fact , in the absence of external magnetic fields a critical coupling necessary to break chiral symmetry is typically large . in the presence of the magnetic field",
    "it is reduced to zero .",
    "for example , it is well known that an interaction of the njl model , @xmath66 when added to the hamiltonian will break the chiral symmetry if the coupling constant is attractive and is greater than a particular critical value .",
    "this is seen by analyzing solutions of the schwinger - dyson equation for a mass condensate .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , in the presence of a magnetic field , the critical coupling moves from some finite value to zero  even an infinitesimal coupling will break the chiral symmetry . that observation is consistent with our finding here .",
    "an interesting test of this idea would be to examine the effect on system with the interaction @xmath67 which can break parity by generating a parity violating fermion mass if @xmath68 has the appropriate sign and is of large enough magnitude @xcite .",
    "our analysis seems to suggest that a large magnetic field should in fact tend to increase the magnitude of the critical coupling .",
    "in 3 + 1 dimensions , the situation is more complicated .",
    "the zero modes of the dirac hamiltonian in a background magnetic field still have some dynamics which is non - trivial and there are more possibilities for interactions .    to understand the general strategy that we will take , begin with the lagrangian which describes dirac fermions interacting with an external electromagnetic field , @xmath69 where @xmath70 . for concreteness",

    "we will assume that this is not the case .",
    "it would be straightforward to extend the present work to models with dynamical @xmath75 fields , by introducing more species of fermions so that there exist chiral symmetries which are unaffected by the axial anomaly .",

    "[ of course , this mass gap is not lorentz invariant from a four - dimensional point of view .",

    "our approach to the problem in the following sections can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we consider the theory of four - dimensional fermions in a magnetic field as described above , with some interactions which should be local and respect ( 3 + 1)-dimensional poincar and chiral symmetry but are otherwise unspecified .",
    "we then consider the effective field theory which is obtained by integrating out all of the massive modes of the fermions in eq .",
    "( [ massless ] ) and momentum states of the massless modes above an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "we assume that the resulting effective lagrangian is local . to guarantee locality",
    ", we generally have to assume that the interactions between fermions in four dimensions are short ranged .",
    "furthermore , the ultraviolet cutoff for the effective theory should be less than the mass gap of the lightest massive mode , @xmath100 .",
    "we consider all relevant operators which could be added to the effective lagrangian which are consistent with the symmetries of the theory . since they should be relevant in the sense of two dimensional field theory , these are all possible four - fermion operators which are consistent with symmetry .",
    "there are an infinite number of such operators .",
    "we compute the beta function for the coupling constants of the relevant operators and look for infrared stable fixed points .",
    "these fixed points should govern the behavior of the very long - wavelength degrees of freedom of the theory . 6 .",
    "if the coupling constants flow to an infrared stable fixed point , then an infrared limit of the massless theory exists and there is no symmetry breaking . if , on the other hand , the coupling constant flow is not in the domain of attraction of any infrared fixed point , so that it flows to strong coupling in the infrared , we postulate that this implies the dynamical generation of a mass gap  and spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "we shall find examples of both kinds of behavior .",
    "an example of a local four dimensional interaction which preserves the @xmath101 chiral symmetry is the njl interaction @xcite , @xmath102 .",

    "the constraints of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional lorentz invariance and @xmath103 chiral symmetry allow four - fermion coupling constants as in the effective theory , @xmath104 the coupling constants @xmath105 obey further constraints from charge conjugation , parity and time reversal ( cpt ) symmetry and the symmetry of the underlying theory under translations and rotations about the axis of the magnetic field which are summarized in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "a general solution of those constraints would yield the most general allowed structure of the low - energy effective action in eq .",

    "similarly , there is a solution with @xmath109 ( with @xmath106 ) symmetry , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is real again .",
    "in addition a large class of solutions could be found by the reduction of the interactions in the original ( 3 + 1)-dimensional model to the lowest landau level .",
    "after such a reduction of the njl interaction ( [ lagnjl ] ) , we arrive at @xmath112 since it descends from a lorentz and chirally invariant interaction in 3 + 1 dimensions , it must necessarily satisfy the constraints of symmetry [ see eqs .",
