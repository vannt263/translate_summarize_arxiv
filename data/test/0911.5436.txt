    "an _ orbitope _ is the convex hull of an orbit of a compact algebraic group @xmath2 acting linearly on a real vector space .",
    "the orbit has the structure of a real algebraic variety , and the orbitope is a convex , semi - algebraic set .",
    "thus , the study of algebraic orbitopes lies at the heart of _ convex algebraic geometry _  the fusion of convex geometry and ( real ) algebraic geometry .",
    "orbitopes have appeared in many contexts in mathematics and its applications .",
    "orbitopes of finite groups are highly symmetric convex polytopes which include the platonic solids , permutahedra , birkhoff polytopes , and other favorites from ziegler s text book @xcite , as well as the coxeter orbihedra studied by mccarthy , ogilvie , zobin , and zobin  @xcite .",
    "farran and robertson s regular convex bodies  @xcite are orbitopal generalzations of regular polytopes , which were classified by madden and robertson  @xcite .",
    "orbitopes for compact lie groups , such as @xmath0 , have appeared in investigations ranging from protein structure prediction  @xcite and quantum information  @xcite to calibrated geometries  @xcite .",
    "barvinok and blekherman studied the volumes of convex bodies dual to certain @xmath0-orbitopes , and they concluded that there are many more non - negative polynomials than sums of squares @xcite .",
    "this paper initiates the study of orbitopes as geometric objects in their own right .",
    "the questions we ask about orbitopes originate from three different perspectives : _ convexity _ , _ algebraic geometry _ , and _ optimization_. in convexity , one would seek to characterize all faces of an orbitope .",
    "in algebraic geometry , one would examine the zariski closure of its boundary and identify the components and singularities of that hypersurface . in optimization , one would ask whether the orbitope is a spectrahedron or the projection of a spectrahedron .",
    "spectrahedra are to semidefinite programming what polyhedra are to linear programming .",
    "more precisely , a _ spectrahedron _ is the intersection of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices with an affine space .",
    "it can be represented as the set of points @xmath3 such that @xmath4 where @xmath5 are symmetric matrices and @xmath6 denotes positive semidefiniteness . from a spectrahedral description many geometric properties , both convex and algebraic , are within reach .",
    "furthermore , if an orbitope admits a representation ( [ eq : lmi ] ) then it is easy to maximize or minimize a linear function over that orbitope .",
    "here is a simple illustration .",
    "[ ex : hankelsmall ] consider the action of the group @xmath7 on the space @xmath8 of binary quartics and take the convex hull of the orbit of @xmath9 .",

    "carathodory orbitope_. this orbitope is a spectrahedron : it coincides with the set of all binary quartics @xmath11 such that @xmath12 this representation ( [ 3by3hankel ] ) will be derived in section 5 , where we will also see that it is equivalent to classical results from the theory of positive polynomials @xcite .",
    "the hankel matrix shows that the boundary of @xmath10 is an irreducible cubic hypersurface in @xmath13 , defined by the vanishing of the hankel determinant .",
    "it also reveals that this four - dimensional carathodory orbitope is @xmath14-neighborly : the extreme points are the rank one matrices , and any two of them are connected by an edge .",

    "the spectrahedral representations of the schur - horn orbitopes , stated in theorems [ thm : symspec ] and [ thm : skewsymspec ] , rely on certain schur functors also known as the _ additive compound matrices_.    given a compact real algebraic group of @xmath17-matrices , we can form its convex hull in @xmath18 .",

    "every point in the orbit @xmath147 is exposed in its convex hull .",
    "in particular , every extreme point of the orbitope @xmath148 is an exposed point .    since @xmath2 acts orthogonally on @xmath32 , the orbit @xmath147 lies entirely in the sphere in @xmath32 that is centered at @xmath146 and contains the point @xmath47 . as every point of the sphere is exposed , the entire orbit consists of exposed points and hence extreme points .",

    "a necessary condition is that the polar body ( see below ) has all faces exposed ( cf .",

    "for example , the four - dimensional barvinok - novik orbitope in section  [ s : caratheodory ] has triangular exposed faces for which the three vertices are exposed but the edges are not .",
