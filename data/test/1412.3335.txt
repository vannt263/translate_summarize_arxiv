    "in part 1 of this lecture series we discuss two topics :    * computational models based on the concept of the continuum * extended proof systems for more efficient certificates of optimality    in the part 2 of this lecture series , we describe efficient evaluation methods for the effect of exponential number of constraints in the context of continuum based algorithms.we illustrate these ideas by considering concrete examples of finding maximum independent set in a graph and the satisfiability problem .",
    "objective function for these problems is treated by non - convex optimization methods covered in part 3 .",
    "a model of computation provides mathematical abstractions of basic data objects and operations on those objects , available as building blocks .",
    "this effectively decouples design of algorithms for complex tasks from lower level details of how the underlying hardware implements the basic primitives .",
    "the turing machine model uses strings of 0 s and 1 s and finite state machines .",
    "careful study of the work of early pioneers ",
    "turing , von neumann and godel  shows that they were acutely aware of the limitations of this model for comprehensive understanding of the fundamental aspects of computation .",
    "bss model(blum , shub , smale ) uses real or complex numbers as data objects and algebraic operations ( including comparisons in real case ) .",
    "this is more natural for many algorithms in numerical analysis , whereas turing machine model might seem more appropriate for discrete applications .          *",
    "numerical simulation of natural phenomena or engineered systems based on differential equations * estimation of probabilities , assessing strength of association between various entities in social networks * interior point algorithms in optimization which are based on embedding discrete configurations in a multidimensional continuous space and constructing trajectories converging to the solution        * standard digital computers * analog computers explored in the past e.g. shannon s differential analyzer * quantum computers * biological systems that appear to do information processing / computing * computers inspired by biological systems and partially mimicking some aspects of those systems + e.g. neural networks , neuromorphic computing , etc .      * * alan turing * was interested in understanding the origin of intelligence in biological systems he believed it is due to some form of computing happening in these systems .",
    "however , there does nt seem to be anything similar to turing machines in these systems .",
    "many years after developing the discrete model of computation , turing started exploration of partial differential equations modelling biological functions these are clearly continuum based models of biological systems . *",
    "* von neumann * defined architecture of a digital computer using many ideas from turing machine model . however , he was particularly critical of the limitations imposed on the theory of automata by its foundations in formal logic , combinatorics .",
    "he articulated the need for a detailed , highly mathematical , and more specifically , analytical theory of computation based on mathematical analysis . * * shannon * worked on analog computer called differential analyzer .",
    "however , direct implementation of differentiation in analog system is highly error prone as it involves subtraction of two nearly equal continuous quantities .      * * role of integration and integral transform * * * it s well known that for certain non - linear differential equations which are difficult to solve numerically , it helps to convert them into equivalent integral equations . * * biological systems seem to use integral transform .",
    "e.g. human ear essentially computes the magnitude of fourier transform of speech signal.the transform of the derivative is then obtained by scaling , a simpler algebraic operation than differentiation in analog setting . *",
    "* some optical computers are implementing fourier transform directly for computing differential operators required in computational fluid dynamic * * form of integration or convolution restricted to non - negative real functions is easier to provide in a physical system . * * robustness * * * in digial systems , the mapping from +   + * physical states * / * quantities * @xmath0 * information states*/*quantities * +   + is many to one , in fact , each information state has infinite pre images . *",
    "* this is to gain robustness in the face of small variations in physical states , due to noise , thermal effects , variations in manufacturing etc . * * however , this does not necessarily require information states to be discrete .",
    "e.g. an ideal low pass filter also provides infinity to one mapping but the output signal still belongs to the continuum .",
    "logical and physical processes underlying computation involves several levels of abstractions , both continuous and discrete .",
    "let us examine a specific application ",
    "solution of a non - linear differential equation .",
    "* this application and algorithm used for solution are both based on continuous model .",
    "* real numbers in the continuous model are approximated by floating point arithmetic for mapping onto the discrete turing machine model . *",
    "the computer implementing discrete turing machine model is actually a network of transistors . as a circuit",
    ", it is modeled by a system of non - linear differential equations .",
    "restricted interpretation is applied to continuous quantities .",
    "e.g. continuous time is divided into clock cycles bigger than settling time of the transient solution to the differential equations , to create discrete time steps.voltage greater than certain threshold voltage represents logical one . in this way ,",
    "the discrete logical model is supported by the underlying circuit - level continuous model . *",
    "this continuous circuit model is itself approximating underlying discrete phenomenon : * * continuous , fluid - like model of current flow , for approximating the statistical mechanics of large number of discrete particles ( electrons and holes in a semiconductor ) * * continuous energy bands ( valence and conduction bands ) representing large number of closely spaced quantized energy levels * the underlying quantum mechanical phenomenon is modelled mathematically by the concept of hilbert space which is based on the continuum concept .",
    "similarly , more recent and on - going model of physics is based on string theory , which again requires the concept of the continuum .",
