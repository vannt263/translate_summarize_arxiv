    "the h.e.s.s . collaboration has performed a survey along the galactic plane in very - high energy ( vhe , @xmath0100 gev ) gamma rays ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . with this program several vhe sources have been discovered and it has further been found that these objects are concentrated at the galactic plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "some of these sources lack counterparts in other wavelength @xcite .",
    "recently , a source with no obvious counterpart in other wavelength has been found with a significant off - set of 3.5 degree from the galactic plane : hess j1507 - 622 @xcite .",
    "this source is detected with an integral flux ( @xmath0 1 tev ) of @xmath1 @xmath2 s@xmath3 and a spectrum given by @xmath4 with @xmath5 and a flux normalization of @xmath6 tev@xmath3",
    "@xmath2 s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the angular distance of hess  j1507 - 622 to the plane results in some interesting constraints on the nature of the source .",
    "either it is rather nearby or if the distance of the object is larger than about one kpc it would be also physically located outside the galactic disk .",
    "its rather compact angular size in comparison to the apparent extension of other vhe sources would suggest a multiple - kpc distance @xcite .",
    "vhe gamma - rays can be generated mainly by two different channels : through inelastic collisions from hadronic cosmic rays with thermal target protons and nuclei and subsequent @xmath7 decay ( hadronic channel ) or by inverse compton up - scattering from low energy photons by high energy electrons ( leptonic channel ) .",
    "additional mechanisms which can produce vhe gamma - rays include interactions of cosmic ray protons with low energy photons and subsequent @xmath7 production and decay and photo - disintegration of heavy nuclei ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for hess j1507 - 622",
    "the gamma - ray emission scenario is not clear at the moment . for the purpose of this paper a hadronic origin",
    "is assumed .",
    "this scenario seems to be more plausible due to the absence of a clear low - energy counterpart . a hadronic model involving interactions between high - energy protons with the ambient inter - stellar medium ( ism ) is adopted to investigate the influence of a location at low density environments on the properties of such sources .",
    "the gamma - ray luminosity in this picture depends on the density of target material which is monotonically decreasing with increasing distance from the galactic plane @xcite .    in many cases the sources of hadronic vhe gamma rays",
    "will be linked to the remnants of catastrophic events at the end of stellar evolution",
    ". objects with significant physical distances from the galactic plane are expected to belong to an old stellar population .",
    "supernovae ( sn ) type ia are typical representatives for stellar explosions connected to such a stellar population .",
    "a vhe gamma - ray emission from the remnant of sn 1006 , which was of type ia , has already been detected @xcite .",
    "this remnant is located at a distance from the galactic plane of 500 pc in an environment with a very low density of target material of 0.085  @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "further sources of gamma - rays with potential off - plane locations might be the remnants of compact binary mergers @xcite and the remnants of low luminosity grbs @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery @xcite of a nearby close white dwarf - neutron star binary ( but see * ? ? ? * for a different interpretation ) and the high rate of mergers of these objects deduced from this discovery @xcite might represent an additional channel for producing gamma - ray sources connected to an old stellar population .",
    "in a hadronic gamma - ray production scenario the gamma - ray luminosity scales linear with the energy in cosmic rays and the density of the target material .",
    "objects without strong stellar winds like white dwarf binaries should not alter their environment and therefore the density of target material is given by the ambient ism .",
    "for off - plane sources the density of target material is expected to drop monotonically with distance since larger distances would place the object at larger physical off - sets from the galactic disk . in the direction of hess j1507 - 622",
    "there is some evidence of molecular gas at a distance of 400 pc but with no clear connection to the gamma - ray source @xcite . at larger distances than this",
    "there is no other indication for further clouds seen .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of this section , to estimate the density of target material the galactic density profile perpendicular to the galactic disk of @xcite is used . since hess j1507 - 622 is located at a galactic latitude of about 317@xmath9 the closest galactocentric distance of the line of sight is about 5.8 kpc and for distances smaller than 10 kpc its galactocentric distance will always be in the range of 4  8 kpc .",
    "hence the best fitting model of the ism density in this galactocentric distance range of @xcite is assumed to obtain the distance dependent density of target material along the line of sight for hess j1507 - 622 . in this framework",
    "this is a conservative approach since this model gives the highest density of all estimates up to a distance of about 5 kpc in the direction of the vhe source ( see fig .",
    "10 of * ? ? ?",
    "the best fitting model is given by    @xmath10    to calculate the number density @xmath11 at the position of hess  j1507 - 622 as a function of distance @xmath12 a physical off - set from the disk @xmath13 of @xmath14 is used .",
    "the density of target material as a function of distance is plotted in fig.1 .",
    "the energy in cosmic rays @xmath15 needed to explain the flux of the vhe source is calculated according to :    @xmath16    here @xmath17 is the integral gamma - ray flux above an energy of 1 tev , @xmath18 is the cooling time of hadronic cosmic rays ( given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 is the distance dependent number density , @xmath21 is the proton - proton cross section of about 40 mb , @xmath22 is the in - elasticity parameter and @xmath23 is the speed of light @xcite ) , @xmath24 is the fraction of the energy of the hadronic interaction channeled into gamma rays and @xmath25 accounts for cosmic rays which produce gamma rays below 1 tev ( @xmath26 , for a cosmic ray spectral index @xmath27 = 2 down to a low energy cut - off of the cosmic ray energy of 1 gev ) .",
    "the energy in cosmic rays as a function of distance can again be seen in fig .",
    "1 . a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for a hadronic model is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    a typical energy of 10@xmath28 ergs produced by a sn would place hess  j1507 - 622 below a distance of about 2 kpc .",
    "if the source would contain 10@xmath29 ergs in hadronic cosmic rays it would be located at a distance of 4 kpc . since",
    "relativistic shock waves are expected to convert a considerable fraction of their initial energy into cosmic rays @xcite a hypothetical grb remnant could be located roughly at such a distance . for distances larger than 5 kpc the energy requirements are getting unrealistically large .",
    "this results from a superposition of increased distance and decreased ambient density . for",
    "an increase in distance from 2 kpc to 6 kpc the energy in cosmic rays will increase by a factor of 40 .",
    "the contribution to this factor due to the increased distance is a factor 9 and the contribution of the decreased density is about 4.4 .    to summarize , the main results from this section are that a typical energy in cosmic rays produced by a supernova of 10@xmath28 ergs would place hess  j1507 - 622 at a distance of less than 2 kpc while distances to this source of up to 5 kpc would still be possible for exceptionally energetic events .",
    "high mass stars typically exhibit strong stellar winds and can therefore create region with enhanced density around them . in general massive stars are usually found close to the galactic plane but runaway stars dynamically ejected from young clusters can travel to off - plane locations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this section",
    "it is explored how a progenitor star which featured a strong stellar wind in the past can alter the properties of the embedding medium into which it explodes as a sn .",
    "the number density of the wind material as a function of distance to the star @xmath30 can be expressed by :    @xmath31    with @xmath32 is the mass loss rate of the star , @xmath33 the mean particle mass in the wind and @xmath34 is the volume of a shell at radius @xmath35 from the star and a thickness @xmath36 which the wind traverses with its velocity @xmath37 in unit time .",
    "the angular radius of hess j1507 - 622 is 0.15@xmath38 @xcite and consequently @xmath39 with @xmath12 being the distance to the source .",
    "the number density of a massive stellar wind ( @xmath40/yr , @xmath41  kms@xmath3 ) at the extension of the vhe source is plotted in fig.3 as a function of distance .",
    "it can be seen that even for such a conservative case the number density of the embedding medium of hess j1507 - 622 would drop to the level of the large scale ism distribution at a distances of about 2 kpc .",
    "the density of a wind - created ambient medium is also compared to the density of target material which would be required if the energy in cosmic rays is fixed for all distances to 10@xmath28 ergs ( see fig .",
    "it is found that a stellar wind can only provide a high enough number density of target material for distances smaller than about 2 kpc for such a case .",
    "the age of the hypothetical remnant can be estimated according to its extension .",
    "there are two different ways how the age of a remnant is linked to its extension . in the first model it is assumed that the remnant follows the typical evolution of a snr which starts with free expansion and then , after the ejecta has pushed away a comparable mass of the ism ,",
    "enters the pressure driven sedov phase . in this scenario",
    "the size of the gamma - ray source corresponds to the expanding shell of the remnant . in the second scenario",
    "it is adopted that cosmic rays were injected in a point - like explosion and the extension results from diffusion of the cosmic rays away from the location of the injection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      for a snr the transition time @xmath42 between the free expansion phase and the sedov phase is given by :    @xmath43{\\frac{3\\ , m_\\mathrm{ej}}{4 \\ , \\pi \\ , n \\ , m_\\mathrm{p}}}\\ ] ]    with @xmath44",
    "the velocity and @xmath45 the mass of the ejecta , @xmath46 the number density and @xmath33 the mean particle mass of the ambient medium . for the case of a sn ia ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 km  s@xmath3 , e@xmath49ergs ) at a distance of 2 kpc and thus a number density given by the large scale ism distribution of 0.3 @xmath8",
    ", the transition time @xmath42 would be about 290 years . for a massive progenitor star with @xmath50 , @xmath51 km  s@xmath3 ( e@xmath49ergs ) located in the same ambient medium at the same distance",
    "the transition time would be about 2250  years .    to estimate the age according to the sedov expansion it is assumed that 10% of the initial kinetic energy of the shock wave @xmath52 is channeled into cosmic rays equivalent to @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the distance dependent energy in cosmic rays from sec .",
    "[ energetics ] .",
    "it is further assumed that the remnant evolves in an ambient medium with the distance dependent density @xmath20 from sec .",
    "[ energetics ] .",
    "the age according to the sedov solution @xmath55 is :    @xmath56    here @xmath57 is the distance dependent radius of the remnant . for a distance of 2 kpc and the corresponding @xmath58 of about @xmath59ergs from section [ energetics ]",
    "the sedov age would be about 340 years .",
    "this is larger than the transition time for the case of a sn ia but smaller than this time scale for a massive progenitor .",
    "thus a remnant of a sn ia would be already in the sedov phase whereas the remnant of a massive progenitor would still be freely expanding .",
    "a remnant with the observed extension of hess  j1507 - 622 at a distance of 2 kpc resulting from the massive progenitor scenario with @xmath51 km  s@xmath3 would have an age of about 1650 years . since snrs are considered to be efficient accelerators of cosmic rays at the beginning of the sedov phase the sn ia scenario with the pressure driven age is considered here .",
    "the age of a hypothetical pressure driven remnant as a function of distance with the extension of hess j1507 - 622 can be seen in fig .",
    "a remnant which produced the typical sn energy in cosmic rays of @xmath60  ergs at a distance of about 2 kpc would have a pressure driven age of less than 1000 years . thus it seems that a sn ia remnant interpretation of hess  j1507 - 622 would only be possible for a remnant with similar age as sn 1006 . since sn 1006 is a prominent source in a wide multiwavelength range it would be surprising for such an interpretation that hess  j1507 - 622 lacks comparable signatures .",
    "in general , the sedov age for hess  j1507 - 622 for any given distance never exceeds about 1000 years .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that for larger distances larger energetics are involved ( see fig . 1 ) and therefore the hypothetical remnant expands accordingly faster .      for the case of a grb remnant",
    "it is assumed that cosmic rays were accelerated in the relativistic shocks created by the central engine @xcite .",
    "after @xmath61 1 year these shocks will become non - relativistic and the cosmic rays which were accelerated in the relativistic shock waves will diffuse away from the injection site . hence for time - scales @xmath62  1  year the evolution of such a remnant can be described by cosmic ray diffusion following point - like injection .",
    "the age of a remnant @xmath63 with extension @xmath57 determined by diffusion of cosmic rays can be expressed by :    @xmath64    with @xmath65 @xmath66 s@xmath3 is the energy dependent diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that this diffusion coefficient was obtained for locations in the galactic plane and that the diffusion coefficient may differ at off - plane locations from this value . with the galactic diffusion coefficient and adopting the source extension of 0.15@xmath67 an age of the remnant of @xmath68 years",
    "is found @xcite .",
    "the distance dependent age of such a remnant can again be seen in fig .",
    "4 .    for a remnant",
    "which size is defined by the diffusion of cosmic rays like it was proposed for grb remnants , the age will be smaller than @xmath69 years for distances which would involve reasonable energetics ( @xmath70 ergs ) and thus are smaller than 5 kpc .",
    "this diffusion based age estimate can be shorter than the galactic rate of rare events .",
    "for example the galactic neutron star - neutron star merger rate was estimated to one event per ( 0.5 - 7)@xmath71 years @xcite .",
    "therefore such a scenario appears to be possible but rather unlikely .    to summarize , in a scenario where the extension of the remnant is determined by cosmic ray diffusion the rather compact size of hess  j1507 - 622 would favor a reasonable frequent astrophysical event ( galactic rate @xmath72 10@xmath73 per year ) as its origin .",
    "with the example of hess  j1507 - 622 it has been shown how constraints could be placed on a hadronic model for off - plane gamma - ray sources if the vhe emission is generated by the remnants of stellar explosions . for hess  j1507 - 622",
    "it has been found that only a young snr ( @xmath61 1000 years ) could explain the extension of the source if it is linked to the size of the entire remnant .",
    "for such a scenario the absence of prominent multiwavelength counterparts seem to be puzzling . especially x - ray emission produced by synchrotron radiation of primary electrons accelerated in the same blast wave as the hadronic cosmic rays would be expected . from limits on the x - ray flux constraints on the electron to proton ratio can be obtained if a magnetic field strength is assumed . for a conservative magnetic field strength of 3 @xmath74 g and using the flux of the closest source from the rosat all - sky survey ( 1rxs j150841.2 - 621006 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a comparison it is found that the electron to proton ratio should not significantly exceed 10@xmath75 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . however , it has to be noted that the caveat for such a comparison is the different extension of the vhe and the x - ray source . for a higher upper limit on any diffuse x - ray emission the constraints on the electron to proton ratio",
    "is more relaxed .",
    "higher values for the magnetic field would constrain the ratio of electrons to protons to even lower limits .    to summarize , a typical value for the energy in cosmic rays for a supernova of 10@xmath28 ergs would place hess  j1507 - 622 at a distance of less than 2 kpc .",
    "such a distance constraint would require a pressure driven age of the remnant of less than 1000 years .",
    "for such a young remnant a small electron to proton ratio of 10@xmath75 would be surprising . also for the case of a hypothetical grb remnant the distance of the source would be limited by constraints on the energetics to @xmath61  5  kpc . in this scenario",
    "the size of the remnant would result from the diffusion of cosmic rays away from the explosion site and the remnant would be relatively young ( @xmath76 years ) .",
