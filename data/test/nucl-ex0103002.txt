    "among the physical methods of importance for archaeological applications , dating techniques occupy a special place .",
    "historians need a variety of information regarding their objects : structure , provenance , culture or authenticity@xmath1 . at the same time there is a great need of dating with precise and objective techniques of the historically valuable material .",
    "there are two categories of physical methods of dating , namely one in which the measured quantity decreases with time , and one in which the physical quantity accumulates in the sample with time .",
    "to the first category belong the methods in which the information on age is given by the disintegration rate of a radioactive nucleus , ranging from @xmath2k , th and u ( relatively abundant isotopes ) to more rare isotopes such as @xmath0c , @xmath3be , @xmath4al , @xmath5si , @xmath6cl , @xmath7ca , @xmath8mn , @xmath9pb .",
    "the second category includes the methods that are based on the measurement of the accumulated defects produced by radiation in the environment , using various techniques : thermoluminescence , electron paramagnetic resonance , fission traces in rocks .    among dating methods ,",
    "radiocarbon dating is the most frequently used . in recent decades accelerator mass spectrometry ( ams)@xmath10 , which constitutes",
    "a highly sensitive method for counting atoms , has been used for the detection of @xmath0c .",
    "the fact that ams counts atoms and not decays results in great advantages compared to radiometric techniques , requiring smaller samples and shorter measuring times .    in the present work we have studied using the ams technique a fossil bone found in the course of the archaeological excavation of a workshop for the processing of flintstones at malu rosu , giurgiu , near the danube river , in romania .",
    "this archaeological assembly is believed to have an age of about 20,000 years , as based on an historical assessment .",
    "other specimens of fossil bones from malu rosu have earlier been analyzed by a relative chemical method .",
    "the age was estimated by determining the fluorine content@xmath11 using neutron activation analysis ( naa ) .",
    "_ pretreatment of the bone sample _ + the first step concerns the extraction of collagen from the bone structure .",
    "collagen is the native , biochemically intact triple - helical macromolecule .",
    "we will use collagen to refer to collagen that has undergone a degree of diagenesis .",
    "alterations during diagenesis are considered to include humification of parts of the molecule , attachment of exogenous humic materials , and hydrolysis with loss of some amino acids .",
    "we have essentially applied the longin method@xmath12 : + a dried bone specimen of about 1 g is powdered using a hard knife .",
    "the bone powder is put into a glass vessel with a rubber cork , which is then connected to a vacuum pump .",
    "about 70 - 80 ml of 2% hcl is added in drops to the bone powder to remove the carbonates .",
    "the co@xmath13 released is evacuated by pumping for 2 - 5 minutes .",
    "the bone is left in this solution for 15 - 24 h. collagen is then retrieved as a sediment in the vessel .",
    "the acid is poured off and the bone sample is washed with distilled water three times ( until the solution is neutral ) .",
    "the collagen is transferred to a 50 ml vessel .",
    "20 - 30 ml of distilled water is added together with some drops of 2% hcl to obtain a ph in the range 2 - 3 .",
    "this solution is kept at a temperature of 90 @xmath14c overnight .",
    "the ph must remain in the range 2 - 3 for the whole period of heating , which ensures that the collagen is dissolved .",
    "+ the collagen solution is filtered to remove all the impurities , and put in the oven at 110 @xmath14c until is completely evaporated .",
    "the collagen , in gelatin form is thus concentrated at the bottom of the test tube .",
    "+ _ transformation to elemental carbon _",
    "+ the next step in the preparation of the bone sample is the transformation of the collagen into pure carbon in the experimental set - up , presented in detail in refs . 6 , 8 and 9 .",
    "the conversion to elemental carbon is done in two steps : the formation of co@xmath13 by the combustion of the collagen , and the reduction of co@xmath13 to carbon . + .",
    "about 200 mg of cuo as oxidation agent is added to the collagen sample in the test tube in order to attain a 100% combustion .",
    "the system is evacuated and the test tube containing the sample is heated with a flame .",
    "the water vapor that is released during the combustion is caught in a cold trap . + .",
    "about 10 mg of metallic iron is put into a double - legged test tube as catalyst for the reduction of the co@xmath13 to carbon .",
    "prior to the reduction process , the catalyst is heated under vacuum to 650 @xmath14c . with co@xmath13 transferred to and frozen in the cold trap of the reduction part of the apparatus , hydrogen gas is let into the system .",
    "it is suitable to have 3 times more hydrogen gas than carbon dioxide .",
    "the reduction process takes about 4 h. when the reduction is complete , the carbon sample is dried by pumping for about 20 minutes .    the carbon sample and the iron catalyst",
    "are pressed into a copper holder with a stainless steel piston .",
    "the iron catalyst provides a good thermal conduction of the sample , which is important for the sputtering process into the ion source .",
    "the copper holder with the pure carbon sample is put into the ion source of the accelerator .",
    "the sample of bone , as pure carbon in the copper holder is arranged in a wheel with 20 positions in the following sequence : 2 standards of oxalic acid , 1 standard of anthracite , 15 carbon samples , with the other 2 positions being for a graphite and an optimizing sample .",
    "anthracite , being a very old coal is considered to contain no traces of @xmath0c traces and by its measurement the background for @xmath0c is obtained both of the accelerator and of the preparation procedure of the samples .",
    "oxalic acid is a standard srm prepared by the usa national bureau of standards , with an accurately known activity of @xmath0c .",
    "the oxalic acid is used to normalize the value of the @xmath0c/@xmath15c ratio of the sample .",
    "the wheel with samples and standards is put into the ion source of the accelerator .",
    "the central part of the lund ams system is a pelletron tandem accelerator , model 3udh , produced by nec , wisconsin usa , and is shown in fig .",
    "the accelerator is run at 2.4 mv during ams experiments , which is optimal for the c@xmath16 charge state when using 3 @xmath17g/@xmath18 carbon stripper foils . on the experimental beam line a magnetic quadrupole triplet , a velocity filter and a second analyzing magnet",
    "have been installed .",
    "the @xmath15c@xmath16 beam current is usually @xmath19 80 na .",
    "the particle identification and measuring system consists of a silicon surface barrier detector of @xmath20=25 mm . part of the accelerator system is operated and controlled by a pc - based system .",
    "the computer system analyses alternately the data of the @xmath15c current received from a current integrator and the @xmath0c counts arriving from the particle detector , to obtain , finally , the ratio @xmath0c/@xmath15c for each sample .",
    "this ratio is corrected for the background ( obtained from the anthracite and oxalic acid standards ) for every sample .",
    "each sample has been measured 7 times .",
    "the precision of the measurements is around 1 % .",
    "the age of the bone was determined in two steps : first the _ conventional radiocarbon age _ was calculated and then the age was converted to calendar years , taking into consideration the fluctuations of the @xmath0c concentration in the atmosphere over time .",
    "the conventional radiocarbon age was calculated by the equation @xmath21 : @xmath22}}{0.9558\\,(^{14}c/^{13}c)_{ox[-19]}}\\biggr)\\ , { \\rm years } \\ , { \\rm bp}\\ ] ] where @xmath23}$ ] is the isotopic ratio for the sample , corrected for the background , normalized to @xmath24=-25 @xmath25 + and @xmath26}$ ] is the isotopic ratio for the oxalic acid standard , corrected for the background , normalized to @xmath24=-19 @xmath25 , + with @xmath24 being : @xmath27\\,\\times\\,1000\\,\\,\\%_0\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the @xmath15c/@xmath29c isotopic ratio for the sample and the oxalic acid , respectively , and @xmath30 is the @xmath15c/@xmath29c isotopic ratio of the @xmath31 standard .",
    "the conventional radiocarbon age of the bone is expressed in years bp , where present is defined to be ad 1950 .",
    "the conventional radiocarbon age for the analyzed bone from malu rosu has been determined to be : 4790@xmath3290 bp .",
    "the conversion into calendar years was done using the oxcal software @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , using data from ref . 14 . from the processing of the data one obtained the age of the bone from malu rosu to be in the interval :      [ [ comparison - of - the - radiocarbon - age - with - the - age - estimated - by - fluorine - content ] ] comparison of the radiocarbon age with the age estimated by fluorine content",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the method of dating by measuring the fluorine content has been used since the end of the 19@xmath33 century .",
    "the increase of the fluorine content is the result of the contact of the fossil bone with underground water which contains fluorine@xmath34 .",
    "the main inorganic component of the bone , hydroxyapatite is slowly altered by the exchange of hydroxyl ions ( oh@xmath35 ) with ions f@xmath35 :",
    "the rate of accumulation of fluorine in bones depends on the environmental conditions of the burials , the temperature and the content of fluorine in underground waters . + some specimens of bones from malu rosu have been analyzed before by naa to determine their fluorine content@xmath11 .",
    "the irradiations were done at the vvr - s nuclear reactor at ifin bucharest , at a flux of 10@xmath29 neutrons/@xmath40s@xmath41 .",
    "samples of bones together with standards of pbf@xmath13 and caf@xmath13 were irradiated for a period of 4 s , for producing the isotope @xmath42f , with a half life of t@xmath43=11 s and the main @xmath44-ray of 1633.6 kev . the periods of decays and times of measurement for the sample were : t@xmath45=40 s , t@xmath46=20 s , and for the standard : t@xmath45=80 s , t@xmath46=20 s. for 8 specimens of bones from romanian regions , c1 , c2 , c4 , c5 , c6 , c8 and c9 , dated by radiocarbon at groeningen , the following correlation was established : fluorine concentration - age ( radiocarbon ) . for other bones : b1 ( cave bear ) , b2 ( cave bear ) , b3 ( cave bear ) , b4 ( mammoth ) and mr ( animal bone from malu rosu ) was evaluated the age , from the content of fluorine , determined by naa , using the calibration curve . in fig .",
    "3 are presented the results of naa of analyzed bones .",
    "also represented are the fluorine concentrations and the ages for some bones from carribean zone@xmath15 . in this region",
    "the climate is warmer and therefore the rate of accumulation of fluorine in the structure of bones is higher than in bones with the same age , from romanian regions .",
    "from the diagram shown in fig . 3 one can estimate for the bone from malu rosu , sample mr , with a content of fluorine of 400 ppm , an age @xmath19 6000@xmath322000 years bp .",
    "for the bone b1 one could estimate an age around 11000@xmath322000 years bp . for the bear b2 and the mammoth b4 , and for the bear b3 , one could estimate an inferior limit of 35000 , respectively 37000 years bp , given by the calibration curve .    taking into consideration a possible saturation of the curve",
    ", the bones b2 and b4 , and b3 could have an age of around 40000 , respectively 45000 years bp .",
    "+ the age of the bone from malu rosu of 5510@xmath32200 bp , determined by @xmath0c measurements using ams in the present study is in agreement with the estimated value of the age of 5000@xmath321000 years bp , determined in other fossil bones from the malu rosu , by measuring their content of fluorine , using naa .",
    "the stratigraphy of the settlement is very complex , containing , besides the four cultural aurignacian levels ( workshops for processing flintstones have been found with some hearths in the central parts ) and cultural levels from the final middle neolithic ( boian culture ) , eneolithic ( gumelnia culture ) , la tne period , early middle age ( dridu culture , ix - xi centuries ) ( fig .",
    "4 ) .    due to the specific conditions ,",
    "namely open areas , the vegetal deposit and the loessial deposit , which start at a depth of approximately one metre , are affected by rodent passages both contemporary and fossil , reaching in some cases a depth of 6 m. under these conditions some archaeological objects have been disturbed and moved from their initial position . furthermore , the neolithic , eneolithic and medieval archaeological complexes have sometimes affected the aurignacian cultural layers .    the fragment of bone studied by ams in the present study originates from the superior part of an aurignacian layer i @xmath47 , surface iii/1995 , the workshop for the processing of flintstones nr . 1",
    ", square d/11 , depth 1.98 m ( fig .",
    "the inferior part of this aurignacian layer , the oldest one in malu rosu , has been dated by ams , at groeningen , on the basis of charcoal fragments from hearths , to have an age of 21,140@xmath32120 bp ( gra-5094 ) and 22,790@xmath32130 bp ( gra-6037 ) .",
    "the value of 3560@xmath32200 bc for the age of the bone determined by ams in the present work associates the bone with the neolithic level of the malu rosu settlement , attributed by us to the final stage of evolution of the boian culture . in the layer mentioned one finds , at a depth of between 0.80 - 1.10 m , the archaeological remains of three houses belonging to the final stage of the boian culture .",
    "some radiocarbon datings for the boian culture can be quoted for some settlements from the danubian region : for the cascioarele settlement , with a layer dated at 4035@xmath32125 bc ( bin-800 ) and 3620@xmath32100 bc ( bin-796 ) and the settlement at radovanu , from the oldest layer ( transitional stage to eneolithic ) , dated to 3820@xmath32100 ( bin-1233)@xmath48 .",
    "thus the fossil bone analyzed in the present work , found in the palaeolithic layer of the malu rosu settlement is dated to have an age of 3560@xmath49 bc , and belongs in fact to the neolithic layer , situated above the palaeolithic one .",
    "this result can be explained by the existence of a dynamics of archaeological objects , by which they can be moved from their original places by an interference with the biosphere .",
