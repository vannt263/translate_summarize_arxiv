    "eclipsing binaries have historically contributed a wealth to stellar astrophysics .",
    "they have been used to determine distances , compute fundamental stellar parameters , and test stellar evolution models .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission @xcite and its unprecedented precise photometry of @xmath0 stars , has allowed us to create a catalog of 2605 eclipsing binaries ( hereafter ebs ) in the _ kepler _ field @xcite .",
    "this catalog is rich in interesting objects for individual study and also presents a large sample of ebs for statistical analysis . in studying this sample , we can attempt to determine the occurrence rate of ebs , circumbinary planets , and multiple star systems .    some theories for short - period binary star formation call for the presence of a third - body .",
    "in these scenarios , the close binary was not created _ in situ _ , but rather at a larger separation as a part of a multiple star system @xcite .",
    "tidal friction and kozai cycles between the inner - binary and a companion can cause the inner - orbit to shrink over time @xcite , and result in a hierarchical multiple system @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopy and imaging studies by @xcite and @xcite have found 40% of binaries with periods less than 10 days , and 96% with periods less than 3 days , have a wide tertiary companion .",
    "the general interpretation of these findings is that the tightest binaries likely became hardened over time through interactions with the tertiary companion , and the system evolves toward an increasingly hierarchical configuration .",
    "indeed , the slowpokes study of ultra - wide binaries in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite found that the widest visual pairs with physical separations of 0.011 pc , in fact contain a tight binary @xmath180% of the time @xcite , again confirming the general picture that tight binaries are nearly always accompanied by wide tertiaries and that the tightest binaries are accompanied by the widest tertiaries .",
    "discovery and study of these multiple systems gives new insight into the physics of ebs .",
    "statistically , we can compare observed rates of multiple systems to theoretical models for short - period binary formation .",
    "we can also model each system individually to study the disruptive dynamical effects seen in some cases .",
    "@xcite determines ephemerides for the entire _ kepler _ eclipsing binary catalog .",
    "if there are no external effects , a linear ephemeris will correctly predict all eclipse times of an eb . by measuring the exact time of each eclipse for a particular binary and comparing it to the calculated time from the linear ephemeris",
    ", we can create an etv curve ( ` eclipse timing variations ' ; sometimes also referred to as an o - c diagram ) .",
    "any trend in these timing residuals may be the result of one or more physical effects occurring in the system .    using transit timings and eclipse timings to find exoplanets is a well - known method @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite used transit timings to detect and study multiple planetary systems , while _ kepler _ 16 @xcite , 34 , and 35 @xcite were validated , in part , through their eclipse timing variations .",
    "the processes that can induce etvs , which are the focus of this paper , include the following :    * light time travel effect ( ltte ) : a third - body perturbing the center of mass of the binary system creates a light - time delay along the line of sight which can cause eclipses to appear earlier or later than expected . *",
    "non - hierarchical third - body : the presence of a third - body actually changes the period of the binary over time . * mass transfer : mass transfer between the components in the binary changes the period . * gravitational quadrupole coupling ( applegate effect ) : spin - orbit transfer of angular momentum in a close binary due to one of the stars being active produces period changes up to @xmath2 times the binary period @xcite . *",
    "apsidal motion : the rotation of the line of apsides causes a change in the time between primary and secondary eclipses even though the period remains unchanged ( requires an eccentric orbit ) .",
    "* spurious signals : due to spots and other effects that distort the eb light curve .",
    "@xcite previously published a list of 39 candidate third - body _ kepler _ systems using eclipse times and @xcite published a preliminary study on timing variations in 41 _ kepler _ eclipsing binaries .",
    "@xcite will provide eclipse times for detached binaries , and this paper provides eclipse times for close binaries .",
    "together , these two papers will comprehensively cover all 2605 binaries in the catalog .",
    "s essentially uninterrupted observing over a long time baseline presents the opportunity to precisely time the eclipses and detect any underlying signals due to third bodies , apsidal motion , dynamical interaction , etc . due to the large number of ebs in the entire catalog , it is necessary to create an automated method for timing eclipses across the catalog .",
    "short period and overcontact systems present a particular challenge due to spot activity and data convolution , due to a relatively long integration time .    in this paper",
    "we discuss our method for automating eclipse timings for close _ kepler _ ebs in section 2 .",
    "eclipse timings are reported for 1279 binaries in the catalog in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "light time travel effect models for the 236 that are flagged as potential third - body candidates are also provided .",
    "we discuss our findings in section 5 in the context of binary formation and evolution theory , and summarize our conclusions as well as information for accessing the products of our comprehensive eclipsing timing measurements in section 6 .",
    "@xcite will update the _ kepler _ eclipsing binary catalog , raising the count of ebs from 2165 to 2605 .",
    "the database is kept up - to - date with future data and revisions at ` http://keplerebs.villanova.edu ` . as changes and updates are made to the catalog , etvs",
    "are being recomputed and updated automatically and made available in real - time through the online catalog .",
    "@xcite will provide eclipse times for binaries with flat out - of - eclipse regions , covering most of the detached binaries with periods greater than 1 day .",
    "there we locally detrend each eclipse and use a piecewise hermite spline template to determine the time of mid - eclipse .",
    "this technique performs well on the set of detached systems but is not optimal for overcontact systems , systems with strong reflection effects or tidal distortion , or short - period binaries with only a few points in each eclipse due to _ kepler _",
    "s 30 minute cadence .",
    "for this reason , we divide the catalog based on the morphology parameter as described in @xcite .",
    "this parameter is a value between 0 and 1 which describes the `` detachedness '' of an eclipsing binary , with 0 being completely detached and 1 being overcontact or ellipsoidal .",
    "@xcite report timings for binaries with a morphology parameter less than 0.5 .",
    "our method addresses and determines eclipse times for the remainder of the _ kepler _ eclipsing binary catalog .",
    "the distribution of the catalog between these two methods is shown in fig .",
    "[ etvcat ] , with 1279 binaries in the sample for this paper .",
    "we detrend and phase `` sap '' ( simple aperture photometry ) _ kepler _ data through q16 as described in @xcite .",
    "the upper envelope of the raw data is fit with a chain of legendre polynomials using a sigma - clipping technique and manually setting the breaks between sections and orders of the polynomials .",
    "the data are then divided by this fit , resulting in a flat baseline .",
    "these detrended data are then phased on the linear ephemeris as reported in @xcite , and used as input into the etv code , described below .",
    "we fit a polynomial chain to the phased light curve data as described in @xcite .",
    "this analytic function is a chain of four polynomials that is continuous , but not necessarily differentiable , at knots which were optimized to find the best overall solution .",
    "this function does not represent a physical model , but rather analytically describes the mean phased shape of the binary light curve , an example of which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ecl_bounds ] .",
    "we then take this analytical representation and , using a combination of heuristic and bisection approaches , determine the horizontal shift required to minimize the @xmath3 ( cost function ) for each individual eclipse as shown in fig .",
    "[ bisection ] . in order to minimize the effect due to spots or imperfect detrending ,",
    "a vertical shift is first determined using linear least squares for each eclipse and is applied before computing cost functions for horizontal shifts .",
    "the cost function is initially sampled at 20 evenly - spaced phase shifts between -0.05 and 0.05 phase .",
    "the minimum of this sampling is then used as the center of the bisection algorithm to quickly find the local minimum of the cost function .",
    "the resulting @xmath4 values are unusually large because the errors on the _ kepler _ data are only formal and do not include any absolute calibration effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , for each eclipse , we normalize the entire cost function such that the minimum cost is set to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of data points used for that eclipse and @xmath7 is the degrees of freedom , which we take to be 1 .",
    "this reduced cost function is then used to compute 1-sigma errors on each timing to correspond to the @xmath8 contour .    for the shortest binaries in the catalog ,",
    "however , the long - cadence data result in significant phase - smearing and limits our method to a very minimal number of points per cycle to determine a fit .",
    "if there were to be a third - body , the signal would likely be buried in the noise induced by these factors .",
    "for this reason , we include as many data points as possible in each eclipse timing . each data point is considered to belong to an eclipse if its phase as determined by the initial linear ephemeris is within bounds .",
    "we initially set these bounds to be the mid - point between polyfit knots in the out - of - eclipse region as shown in fig .",
    "[ ecl_bounds ] . to improve results for particular objects being studied individually , changing these bounds to use the knots ( instead of the mid - points ) can sometimes lower the systematics in the signal . for",
    "any given eclipse , if the region between these bounds is not fully sampled or does not have at least 3 data points , then timings are not computed for that eclipse .",
    "eclipse timings are then compared to the values expected from the linear ephemeris as reported by @xcite to compute the residuals and test for the presence of an etv signal .      due to a typically small number of points per eclipse ,",
    "our timings are sensitive to various imperfections in the data processing , affecting the measured eclipse time and potentially introducing noise and/or fictitious signals in the etv signal . instrumental or astrophysical pulsations on top of the binary signal can change the shape of a single eclipse which can mimic a timing variation .",
    "the detrending process attempts to remove these additional signals , but is not perfect , struggles at removing signals that happen during eclipse , and can also introduce spurious signals . also , all polyfits in the current version of the catalog use chains of four second - order polynomials , which does not always result in the ideal fit and can leave slight phase - dependent residuals . for the purpose of pipeline processing , we limit ourselves to second order polynomials , but note that , for special cases and in - depth studies , higher precision timings can be obtained by increasing the order of the fit .",
    "until all polyfits are updated to a higher order in the future , we will use the second - order fits and manually run etv signals with a higher order for any individual etv signals that warrant further study . in the cases",
    "when a binary has a period that is near - commensurate to _ kepler _ s 29.44 minute cadence , the period and cadence may beat , which results in a separate spurious signal .",
    "any combination of these effects can cause issues in determining true and precise eclipse times when dealing with only a few data points .    fig .",
    "[ anti - phase ] demonstrates how the cost function for the phase shift is affected by the vertical discrepancy in the out - of - eclipse region , creating a fictitious signal in which the etvs of the primary and secondary eclipse are in anti - phase .",
    "the left of fig .",
    "[ anti - phase ] plots four different eclipses , showing that over time the data in the out - of - eclipse region can be higher on either the right or the left .",
    "when measuring timings for the primary and secondary separately , the cost function will artificially be minimized by `` pulling '' the analytic function towards the region with lower flux . since this will affect the primary and secondary in the opposite direction , we can mitigate for this effect by also running the fit over the entire phase .",
    "this effectively averages out the anti - phase effect in the primary and secondary eclipses , projecting the real etv signal of the entire system .",
    "[ anti - phase - beforeafter ] shows two cases where the anti - phase signal was removed , clearly showing whether there is a presence of any underlying etv signal .",
    "these signals that show a `` random walk '' nature are discussed by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , since there is no rigorous way to discriminate between true and fictitious anti - phase signals , this process would also hide a physical etv signal such as apsidal motion .",
    "since we are dealing with short - period binaries , most of these orbits will be quite circular so we do not expect to be able to detect any systems with apsidal motion anyway .",
    "if a binary has short - cadence data available , they are usually limited to a short time baseline .",
    "since we are generally looking for long period trends in the etv signal , we measure timings from the full long cadence dataset .",
    "we also run timings on any available short cadence data in case some signal can be detected .    a few short period binaries in the catalog that appear to be overcontact or ellipsoidal variables",
    "could actually be detached systems whose light curves are convolved by _ kepler _",
    "s 30 minute long cadence exposure .",
    "since these systems are less prone to timing noise due to spots or mass transfer than true overcontact systems , the phase smearing and limited data points per eclipse are the main issues preventing us from recovering any etv signal .",
    "for this reason , short cadence data were requested and obtained via director s discretionary time for 31 short - period detached ebs in the catalog without previous short - cadence observations in the hope of detecting third - body etv signatures which were not visible in the long - cadence data .",
    "unfortunately , none seem to exhibit any significant etvs .",
    "eclipse times are computed for all available short - cadence data , but due to the longer baseline , long - cadence timings are used for detection and fitting of potential third - body orbits .",
    "eclipse timing variations on the individual eclipses and the entire phase have been run for all objects with a morphology parameter greater ( less detached ) than 0.5 in the latest _ kepler _ eclipsing binary catalog .",
    "our method requires at least 3 data points per timing , which allows us to get primary and secondary eclipse timings individually for long cadence data of binaries with periods as short as 3 hours and full phase timings for binaries as short as 1.5 hours .",
    "we are able to determine timings for any binary with short cadence data , but since short cadence data availability is sparse and generally not for the whole length of the mission , short cadence etvs are determined separately .",
    "plots and data for detrended light curves and eclipse times for the entire sample are available as a part of the _ kepler _ eclipsing binary online catalog at ` http://keplerebs.villanova.edu ` .",
    "an excerpt of the eclipse times is shown in table [ tableetvs ] . with the third version of the catalog",
    "being released shortly , the database will be updated as new data become available and ephemerides are further refined .",
    "this etv code is incorporated into the pipeline : as objects are updated or added , their etvs are recomputed and updated in real - time .",
    "as etvs are computed , the ephemerides in the catalog are refined by fitting a linear fit through the entire - phase timings and adjusting the values as necessary to get a `` flat '' trend . for any etv with a long - term sinusoidal trend ,",
    "this could introduce systematics depending on the part of the sine curve observed and used to fit the linear trend .",
    "in particular , for very long etv signals ( of the order of 1000 days and more ) , the measured orbital period of the binary will be anomalous because the variation can not be accounted for from available data .",
    "all etv measurements were examined by eye for the presence of any interesting signal , discarding any that seem to be spurious based on their individual primary and secondary eclipse timings .",
    "we do not expect to see evidence of apsidal motion in many of our targets due to their short periods and , consequently , circular orbits .",
    "we also do not expect to be able to detect any signals due to gravitational quadrupole coupling .",
    "this mechanism is able to create period changes with amplitudes on the order of @xmath2 times the period of the binary , meaning a maximum of 3.5 seconds for a binary with a period of 4 days , falling well within our noise limits .",
    "etv signals that are sinusoidal in nature or show any sign of curvature are flagged and fit for both a third - body signal and a parabolic mass transfer model . for the cases where we only see a sign of curvature and not a full cycle",
    ", we could either be seeing a section in a long period third body signal or mass transfer . to determine whether we consider the signal as a candidate third body or mass transfer",
    ", we compare the two models using the bayesian information criterion @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the data , @xmath11 the model , @xmath12 the number of data points , and @xmath13 is the number of parameters used in the fit . in the case of the eccentric ltte model @xmath14 , for the circular ltte model @xmath15 , and for the mass transfer model @xmath16 .",
    "the better fit , as determined by the lower bic value , then determines whether we consider the signal as a candidate third body or mass transfer .",
    "thirty - one etv signals were better fit by a parabola than an ltte orbit , and are possibly caused by mass transfer or the applegate effect instead of the presence of a third body @xcite . a selection of these signals are shown in fig .",
    "[ etv_mt ] , all kics are listed in table [ tablemt ] , all of which are available on the online catalog .      236 binaries ( of the sample )",
    "were flagged as candidate third bodies .",
    "the results of the model fits are reported in table [ tablerapp ] with a selection plotted in fig .",
    "[ etv_ltte ] . based on the fitted period",
    ", we then divided these third body candidates into three sections .",
    "the first group contains third body signals with periods less than 700 days , such that there are at least two full cycles of the signal present in data through q16 .",
    "these systems have the highest confidence and are most likely due to the presence of a tertiary component .",
    "the second group contains signals with periods between 700 and 1400 days , such that there is at least one full cycle present .",
    "the last group contains signals with periods longer than 1400 days .",
    "often these detections merely show some sign of curvature in the etv signal and so a full sinusoidal signal can not yet be confirmed .",
    "for this reason the fits generally have large errors and many of these may not even be true triple systems , particularly the signals on the closest binaries which are more likely to be due to mass transfer .",
    "@xcite presented an initial study of eclipse timings in 41 _ kepler _ binaries .",
    "of their entire sample of 41 binaries , 40 are still in the _ kepler _ eb catalog ( kic 4678873 has since been removed from the catalog as a false positive ) , 32 fall under the scope of this paper ( have a morphology less detached than 0.5 ) , and 9 appear in our list of third - body signals .",
    "they identified 14 out of their original 41 as candidate third - body systems , with others being identified as likely caused by starspots , pulsations , and apsidal motion . of their 14 candidate third - body systems ,",
    "all 14 are still in the _ kepler _ eb catalog , 12 fall under the scope of this paper , and 9 appear in our list of third - body signals . those that appear in both lists",
    "are noted in table [ tableresults ] .",
    "binaries that they list as candidate third - body systems , but we do not , either show significant noise or would be very long period ltte orbits .",
    "@xcite recently reported 39 triple - star _",
    "binaries due to etv signatures . of these 39 , 21 fall under the scope of this paper , 19 of which also appear in our list of third - body signals , with the other two determined to be unlikely caused by a third - body due to their very short periods and notable spot activity .",
    "the detections that overlap both of these studies are also noted in table [ tablerapp ] . in most cases ,",
    "the model fits from both studies are consistent . in general ,",
    "due to our treatment of the full _ kepler _ dataset now available , tertiary parameters should now be more precise and longer period third body signals are now more apparent .",
    "any disagreement is likely due to a slightly differ inner - binary ephemeris or the addition of the physical delay in their models ( discussed further below ) .",

    "this expression was then used to fit all etvs flagged as potential third body signals .",
    "the period was first estimated using lomb - scargle periodogram and used as input into a series of levenberg - marquardt fits , each using a different starting guess for eccentricity .",
    "the fit with the lowest chi - squared was then kept and the errors estimated from the covariance matrix . if the final fit had an eccentricity consistent with 0 , then @xmath24 was set to 0 , @xmath25 to @xmath28 , and the fitting was redone with circular constraints to get appropriate error estimates on the remaining parameters .",
    "this gives values and estimated errors for @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath29 ( table [ tableresults ] ) .",
    "a sample of some of these etv signals and their respective fits can be seen in fig .",
    "[ etv_ltte ] , with fits for all candidate third body signals available in the online version of the _ kepler _ eb catalog",
    ". we can only provide estimate periods for the sample of etv signals with less than one full cycle in the data .",
    "even these periods can be significantly biased based on the section of the cycle that is in the observed baseline and should be treated with reservation .",
    "these very long period cases are provided separately at the end of table [ tableresults ]      @xcite included physical delays in their models of 39 _ kepler _ binaries with possible third - body etvs , sometimes contributing largely to the overall model .",
    "this dynamical effect occurs when the presence of a third body changes the period of the inner binary .",
    "[ phys_hist ] shows the distribution in their targets and the overlapping targets of the ratio of the amplitude of the physical delay compared to the total amplitude in the etv signal .",
    "21 of their targets overlap with ours , but due to the short - period inner - binary , the physical delay rarely contributes significantly to these model . from their results , it seems that the ltte effect dominates over the physical delay for binaries with periods less than 3 days , which covers the vast majority of our targets .",
    "for some of these binaries with ltte signals , tertiary eclipses have also been found that confirm the presence and third body period , and significantly constrain the inclination of the third body .",
    "any binary which was identified to have a possible third body due to its etv signal and also has a detected tertiary eclipse is noted as such in table [ tableresults ] .",
    "kic 2856960 , for instance , has an inner - binary period of 0.259 days with an etv signal resulting in a ltte fit with a period of @xmath30 days .",
    "this period is consistent with the previously determined period for the tertiary events of 204.25 days ( fig .  [",
    "2856960 ] ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the ltte period of @xmath31 days reported by @xcite , and the tertiary event period of @xmath32 days by @xcite .    in the case of kic 2835289 ( fig .",
    "[ 2835289 ] ) , we have only observed one potential tertiary event in q9 . without at least three consecutive events",
    ", we can not rigorously confirm that the eclipse is a third - body as opposed to a blended eclipsing binary .",
    "however , the eclipse seems to show the eclipse of both stars in the inner - binary and etv signal shows a possible long - term third body orbit suggesting a period of approximately 800 days .",
    "if this proves to be a true third body , then _ kepler _ just missed an event before the beginning of the mission and may have observed another event in q17 , which has yet to be processed .",
    "kic 6543674 also shows a single tertiary eclipse in q2 .",
    "a second tertiary eclipse was missed during a break in the _ kepler _ data , but we were able to observe an additional tertiary event from the ground , giving a third body period of @xmath33 days @xcite .",
    "in this case , we do not have a full orbit of the etv signal and the ltte model period is quite uncertain .",
    "nine binaries that show third - body etv signals ( kic 3936357 , 4069063 , 5310387 , 6629588 , 7375612 , 8122124 , 8758716 , 10014830 , and 10855535 ) also show constant changes in their eclipse depths ( fig .  [ dv ] ) , which could either be caused by a change in inclination or apsidal motion perhaps induced by the third body .",
    "we plan to follow these up later with full photodynamical models .",
    "it is also possible that some of these etvs could be composed of multiple signals .",
    "kic 5310387 , 6144827 , 8145477 , 11612091 , and 11825204 , for example , may have both an ltte and quadratic component or two ltte signals as is shown in the residuals in fig .",
    "in general , the stronger signal is fitted and noted .",
    "in this study we find a third body rate of in our sample of close binaries , nearly all of which have inner binary periods shorter than 3 days ( fig .  [ ptrip ] ) .",
    "this is much lower than the third body rate of 96% found by the previous studies mentioned .",
    "however , our identification of tertiary companions is certainly a lower limit for several reasons .",
    "first , our ability to detect a third body is very sensitive to both inclination and mass of the third body , such that low - mass tertiaries and/or tertiaries whose orbital planes are highly inclined relative to the inner binary orbital plane do not present detectable ltte effects . of our total sample of 1279 binaries , 3 ( )",
    "show an ltte orbit and visible tertiary eclipses .",
    "111 ( ) have ltte orbits with periods shorter than the span of our photometric data but do not show tertiary eclipses , suggesting that the eclipses fell in a gap in the data or the orbits are not well enough aligned to show eclipses .",
    "thus there is evidence from these examples that in a few percent of cases we are indeed missing true third bodies because of inclination non - alignments .",
    "94 ( ) have ltte orbits with periods longer than the photometric baseline . in these cases",
    "we do not have well constrained periods and our chances of detecting a tertiary eclipse are slim .",
    "a second reason that our determination of the third - body occurrence is likely a lower limit is that the very close binaries that comprise our sample here generally present more noise in the etv signal , which could easily bury a weak ltte signal .",
    "we have employed a method that minimizes false positives due to spurious etv signals , and thus necessarily have eliminated some potentially true ltte signals .",
    "third , and perhaps most important , the limited timespan of the currently available _ kepler _ data ( @xmath11400 days ) significantly restricts us to detect third bodies with orbital periods comparable to or shorter than 1400 days . relative to the full span of tertiary separations found in previous works @xcite , with separations as large as @xmath11 pc , we are at present sampling only the relatively closest tertiary companions .",
    "indeed , @xcite found among tight binaries that the rate of third bodies with orbital periods less than @xmath13 years ( comparable to our limit based on the duration of the available _ kepler _ data ) is 15% @xmath34 3% .",
    "thus our finding of a third - body occurrence rate with a period less than 1400 days of is compatible with the expected rate , though it appears we are likely still missing a fraction of some systems for the reasons already mentioned .    the distribution of periods of potential third body orbits is also shown in fig .  [ ptrip ] .",
    "we can clearly see a falloff in detection past the current length of the _ kepler _ mission of @xmath1 1400 days , as expected .",
    "however , for third - body periods shorter than @xmath1 1400 days , for which our detectability is relatively good , the occurrence rate does appear to increase toward longer third - body periods , consistent with the period distribution of third bodies among tight binaries found by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find that the triples on the widest orbits are found around the shortest period binaries , which is consistent with models that tighten the inner binary orbit through the presence , and gradual widening , of a companion .",
    "we presented our technique for computing precise eclipse timings for 1279 close eclipsing binaries in the _ kepler _ eclipsing binary catalog .",
    "these precise eclipse timings are complemented by the eclipse timings to be reported by @xcite for longer period , detached ebs . for the ebs",
    "whose timings are reported here , our method has been developed specifically to deal with the challenge of constantly changing light levels arising from spots and other phenomena that distort the light curves and could cause spurious eclipse timing variation ( etv ) signals .",
    "ebs with etv signals suggesting the possible presence of a third body have been identified and have been fit with a ltte orbit model in order to determine the likely parameters of the third bodies . in the current sample of 1279 close ebs , we have identified 236 that likely have tertiary companions .",
    "the parameters of these fits are also available online and are updated as new data become available .    our measured occurrence rate of of close binaries with tertiary companions with periods up to @xmath35 days ( limited by the current timespan of _ kepler _ data ) , appears to be broadly consistent with the expectation that @xmath36% of close binaries will have tertiaries of such periods @xcite .",
    "indeed , we already find in our data that the periods of third bodies rise among the tightest binaries , consistent with previous work that has found a very high rate of third bodies in very wide orbits around the tightest binaries , presumably the result of dynamical tightening of inner binaries through widening of the tertiary .",

    "<S> 236 systems for which we find a timing variation signal compatible with the presence of a third body are identified . </S>",
    "<S> these are modeled for the light time travel effect and the basic properties of the third body are derived . </S>",
    "<S> this study complements @xcite , which focuses on eclipse timing variations of longer period binaries with flat out - of - eclipse regions . </S>",
    "<S> together , these two papers provide comprehensive eclipse timings for all binaries in the _ kepler _ eclipsing binary catalog , as an ongoing resource freely accessible online to the community . </S>"
