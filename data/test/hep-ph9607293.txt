    "reliable estimates of heavy - light meson decay constants are important , since they appear in many processes from which fundamental quantities can be extracted @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations have focused on estimating decay constants for the weakly decaying pseudo - scalar meson and its hqet ( heavy quark effective theory ) related vector meson . whereas the decay constant of the weakly decaying pseudo - scalar meson is of paramount importance for determining fundamental quantities , the decay constant of the @xmath2-wave vector meson plays a role in exclusive @xmath3 transitions @xcite and in radiative leptonic decays of heavy - light mesons @xcite .    while those decay constants have been and continue to be studied intensively ,",
    "the decay constants of the more highly excited heavy - light states have been normally ignored .",
    "this note attempts to rectify this situation , by predicting decay constants for many higher - excited resonances .",
    "that could be important phenomenologically on several accounts .",
    "first , cleo recently observed a significant wrong charm contribution in @xmath4 decays @xcite , @xmath5 governed essentially by the @xmath6 quark transitions .",
    "the @xmath7 transitions were overlooked in all previous experimental analyses . under the factorization assumption @xcite , wherein the virtual @xmath8 hadronizes independently to the rest of the system , a quantitative modelling of the @xmath7 transitions can be undertaken once theory provides the decay constants for @xmath9 .",
    "second , reliable estimates for decay constants of @xmath10 allow one to test whether color - allowed and color - suppressed decay amplitudes interfere constructively for the @xmath11 modes , as has been seen for the @xmath12 transitions @xcite .",
    "third , such estimates enable us to better predict subtle cp violating phenomena .",
    "decay constants are defined through matrix elements of vector and pseudo - vector currents between meson states and the vacuum . therefore , in order to calculate them , one has to find a way to evaluate hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the mock - meson method @xcite has been frequently used in the literature for that purpose @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow the same approach , and use the mock - meson method in order to obtain expressions for the decay constants of heavy - light mesons , in terms of integrals over momentum - space bound - state wave functions . for numerical estimates we decided to use the simplest relativistic generalization of the schr@xmath13dinger equation @xcite , sometimes called the spinless salpeter equation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the mock - meson method in section [ mock ] .",
    "our approach is based on the @xmath14-@xmath14 coupling scheme , since it is more appropriate for heavy - light mesons than the usual @xmath15-@xmath2 scheme .",
    "expressions for the decay constants of heavy - light meson states are given in section [ dcon ] .",
    "the relativistic quark model and our numerical estimates are described in section [ nres ] .",
    "there we also comment on recent calculations of pseudo - scalar and vector decay constants @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ conc ] .",
    "as already mentioned , the mock - meson approach @xcite has been widely used for calculations of hadronic matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the method is simple .",
    "the mock meson is defined as a collection of free quarks weighted with a bound - state wave function .",
    "the mock - meson matrix elements @xmath16 can then be calculated using full dirac spinors . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical matrix elements @xmath17 can always be expressed in terms of lorentz covariants with coefficients @xmath18 , which are lorentz scalars . in many simple cases ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath16 will be of the same form .",
    "the mock - meson prescription then says that in those cases one should simply take @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , this correspondence is exact in the zero - binding limit and in the meson rest frame . away from this limit",
    "the mock amplitudes are in general not invariant by terms of order @xmath20 .    in this paper",
    "we are primarily concerned with the decay constants of heavy - light @xmath21 mesons . in the @xmath22 limit",
    ", heavy quark symmetry tells us that the angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom ( ldf ) in the heavy - light meson decouples from the spin of the heavy quark , and both are separately conserved by the strong interaction @xcite .",
    "therefore , total angular momentum @xmath14 of the ldf is a good quantum number .",
    "for each @xmath14 there are two degenerate heavy meson states ( @xmath23 ) , which can be labeled as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "this implies that in the case of heavy - light mesons the @xmath14-@xmath14 coupling is more appropriate than the @xmath15-@xmath2 coupling scheme .",
    "for this reason , we first define the ldf states @xmath26 as clebsch - gordan ( cg ) combinations of the eigenstates of orbital angular momentum @xmath27 , and those of the spin of the light quark @xmath28 , with cg coefficients denoted as @xmath29 . combining the ldf states with those of the heavy antiquark @xmath30 ( with cg coefficients @xmath31 ) , we get the @xmath21 mock meson state in its rest frame , @xmath32 in the above expression @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the mock - meson mass , and the color wave function ( subscript c denotes color ) is written explicitly . also , @xmath35 is a normalized momentum wave function , where @xmath36 denotes all other quantum numbers of a state not connected to angular momentum ( e.g. , radial quantum number ) .",
    "the factor @xmath37 appears due to our normalization convention for creation and annihilation operators @xcite , @xmath38 , etc .",
    "the mock - meson states as given in ( [ mmes ] ) are normalized to @xmath39 .",
    "as already observed in @xcite , the mock - meson approach suffers from a number of ambiguities , such as the choice for quark masses , or the definition of the mock - meson mass @xmath34 . in the spirit of the method",
    ", the mock - meson mass should be defined as @xmath40 . however , as pointed out in @xcite , the mock - meson mass has been introduced to give the correct relativistic normalization of the meson s wave function , and hence the use of the physical meson mass @xmath41 instead of @xmath42 may be more appropriate .",
    "we adopt the same approach , and write @xmath43 .",
    "we also note that the heavier the mesons are , the less important it is how the mock - meson mass is defined , since the relativistic effects and binding energies become less significant . as far as quark masses are concerned , the self - consistency of the model requires the use of constituent quark masses . in our error estimates",
    "we have included variations of constituent light quark masses over a range of about @xmath44 , and also of heavy quark masses over a range of about @xmath45 , so that we believe that uncertainties introduced by a particular choice of quark masses are being properly taken into account .",
    "decay constants of heavy - light mesons are defined through matrix elements of vector @xmath46 and pseudo - vector @xmath47 currents between a meson state and the vacuum . following standard definitions in the literature @xcite , for pseudo - scalar ( p ) , vector ( v ) , scalar ( s ) , and pseudo - vector ( a ) mesons , we write @xmath48",
    "note that in the heavy quark limit @xmath49 and @xmath50 states are degenerate ( @xmath2-waves ) , and so are @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath0-wave states ) . the spin 2 members of @xmath0-wave ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath1-wave ( @xmath54 ) doublets do not couple leptonically due to conservation of angular momentum .    in order to obtain expressions for decay constants in terms of integrals over momentum - space meson wave functions ,",
    "we evaluate the matrix elements ( [ fps])-([fv32 ] ) in the meson rest frame using ( [ mmes ] ) .",
    "of course , any choice of polarization for spin 1 mesons should yield the same result .",
    "as mentioned earlier , current matrix elements between states defined in ( [ mmes ] ) and the vacuum can be evaluated exactly with full dirac spinors .",
    "because of spherical symmetry , the momentum - space wave function can be written in the form @xmath55 in the above @xmath56 are the usual spherical harmonics , and @xmath57 is the radial part of the wave function , where @xmath58 denotes @xmath59 henceforth . using ( [ wf ] ) , and keeping track of the relevant cg coefficients",
    ", we find that all heavy - light meson decay constants in the mock - meson approach can be written in the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 r_{n0}(p)\\ , \\label{fi1}\\\\ f_{v_{1/2}}(p ) & = & \\left [ 1 + \\frac{1}{3 } \\frac{p^{2}}{(m_{q}+e_{q})(m_{\\overline{q}}+e_{\\overline{q } } ) } \\right ] r_{n0}(p)\\ , \\label{fi2}\\\\ f_{s}(p ) & = & \\left [ \\frac{1}{(m_{q}+e_{q } ) } - \\frac{1}{(m_{\\overline{q}}+e_{\\overline{q } } ) } \\right]p r_{n1}(p)\\ , \\label{fi3}\\\\ f_{a_{1/2}}(p ) & = & \\left [ \\frac{1}{(m_{q}+e_{q } ) } + \\frac{1}{3 } \\frac{1}{(m_{\\overline{q}}+e_{\\overline{q } } ) } \\right]p r_{n1}(p)\\ , \\label{fi4}\\\\ f_{a_{3/2}}(p ) & = & \\left[\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3 } \\frac{1}{(m_{\\overline{q}}+e_{\\overline{q } } ) } \\right]p r_{n1}(p)\\ , \\label{fi5}\\\\ f_{v_{3/2}}(p ) & = & \\left[\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3 } \\frac{1}{(m_{q}+e_{q } ) } \\frac{1}{(m_{\\overline{q}}+e_{\\overline{q } } ) } \\right]p^{2 } r_{n2}(p)\\ . \\label{fi6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expressions ( [ fi1 ] ) and ( [ fi2 ] ) were found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to observe that in the limit @xmath22 ( [ fi])-([fi6 ] ) become @xmath62 with @xmath63 equality of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and also that of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , as well as vanishing of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , are in the heavy quark limit expected from the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "in order to obtain numerical estimates for the decay constants of heavy - light mesons , we consider the simplest and widely used generalization of the non - relativistic schr@xmath13dinger equation @xcite with hamiltonian given by @xmath70 where for @xmath71 we take the qcd - motivated coulomb - plus - linear potential @xcite @xmath72 for the sake of simplicity , we take @xmath73 to be a fixed effective short range coupling constant .",
    "the effective string tension of the model can be determined from the requirement that the linear regge structure of the model in the light - light limit agrees with the observed slope of the @xmath74 trajectory @xcite .",
    "fixing @xmath75 , other parameters can be chosen so that the model reproduces the observed spin - averaged spectrum of the known heavy - light states .",
    "one such set of parameters includes constituent quark masses @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , and also @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . and @xmath83 mesons ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 states ) of about @xmath86 .",
    "] as can be seen in table [ spectrum ] , these parameters yield an excellent description of the observed spin - averaged heavy - light spectrum .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of pseudo - scalar and vector decay constants .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite used ( [ srqm ] ) with six different potentials , and with current quark masses from @xcite , minimized the hamiltonian with respect to the variational parameter @xmath87 of a single harmonic oscillator ( ho ) wave function , @xmath88 and then used the wave function obtained in this way to get pseudo - scalar and vector decay constants from ( [ fi ] ) , ( [ fi1 ] ) and ( [ fi2 ] ) .",
    "however , a single harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis state is not a suitable approximation for the meson wave function .",
    "namely , lattice simulations @xcite show that heavy - light wave functions fall exponentially with large @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , and therefore ho wave functions ( @xmath91 ) can not be expected to reflect the correct dynamics of heavy - light mesons .",
    "if single basis states are used , a much better choice would be pseudo - coulombic ( pc ) basis states @xcite which fall exponentially with large @xmath89 and appear to be in a good agreement with the lattice data , as can be seen in figure [ wfplt ] .",
    "models such as the one we are using here are usually solved by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix in a particular ( truncated ) basis , with basis states depending on some variational parameter @xcite .",
    "as one increases the number of basis states , the dependence of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions on the variational parameter should vanish for the lowest states . in the case of qcd - motivated potentials",
    "the solutions obtained with the pc wave functions converge much more rapidly with an increase in the number of basis states , than those obtained with the ho wave functions .",
    "we illustrate that in figure [ bplt ] , by plotting the dependence of energy of the lowest @xmath92 state on the variational parameter for @xmath93 , 5 and 15 basis states , for both pc and ho wave functions .",
    "one can clearly see that the lowest @xmath92 ho wave function is not a very good trial wave function in a variational calculation of ( [ srqm ] ) ( with qcd - motivated potentials ) . furthermore , even if one believes that the @xmath93 ho result for a state energy is acceptable ( it is roughly @xmath94 higher than the exact solution , as can be seen in figure [ bplt ] ) , that still does not justify the use of a single ho basis state as a meson wave function .",
    "this issue is clearly important in calculations where a correct description of meson dynamics is needed , such as calculations of meson decay constants .",
    "results obtained by varying a single ho basis state are thus to be interpreted as non - relativistic estimates of some effective harmonic oscillator potential , and not as the results of a qcd - motivated relativistic quark model .",
    "one can now observe that if one uses enough basis states , the choice of basis wave functions should not matter , and pseudo - scalar and vector decay constants should be obtainable from the relativistic quark model considered here .",
    "the problem is , however , that the @xmath92 wave function is divergent at the spatial origin @xcite , i.e. , @xmath95 the singularity for @xmath96 is related to the singularity of the short - range coulomb potential . by increasing the number of ( usually finite at @xmath97 ) basis states",
    ", one is gradually beginning to see that singularity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from ( [ div ] ) one can see that the degree of divergence highly depends on the choice of @xmath73 .",
    "because of that , one can expect that pseudo - scalar and vector decay constants can not be reliably estimated within the model we are considering . in figures",
    "[ fpsplt ] and [ fvplt ] we demonstrate the dependence of the pseudo - scalar ( @xmath1-meson ) and vector ( @xmath98-meson ) decay constants on the number of basis states ( @xmath99 ) , for both pc and ho wave functions .",
    "as one can see , for small @xmath99 both @xmath64 and @xmath65 are significantly increasing with an increase in @xmath99 . by including enough basis states ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath99 would eventually vanish . )",
    "the results for @xmath64 are better behaved than those for @xmath65 .",
    "for example , @xmath64 obtained with @xmath100 pc states are usually larger than those obtained with @xmath101 by only a few @xmath102 . on the other hand , the same increase in @xmath99 in general leads to increase in @xmath65 by several hundred @xmath102 .",
    "] however , as implied by ( [ div ] ) , both @xmath64 and @xmath65 are quite sensitive to the particular choice of parameters of the model . in our calculations",
    "we have observed that results obtained with fixed @xmath99 can vary up to a few hundred @xmath102 . because of that , we were not able to obtain reliable estimates of @xmath64 and @xmath65 from the model considered in this paper . and",
    "[ fvplt ] it should be clear that in the model considered here the ratio @xmath103 also can not be determined with reasonable errors . ]    one possible solution of the problem discussed above would be to replace the @xmath104 potential with the one - loop single gluon exchange potential , i.e. , @xmath105 .",
    "the @xmath92 solution of ( [ srqm ] ) in that case is still divergent , but the divergence is only logarithmic @xcite .",
    "this should lead to much more stable results than the ones shown in figures [ fpsplt ] and [ fvplt ] .",
    "these results should also be much less dependent on the specific choice of the model parameters .",
    "in fact , such a calculation for @xmath64 ( for @xmath1 , @xmath106 , @xmath4 , and @xmath107 mesons ) was already performed by capstick and godfrey in @xcite using the model of @xcite .",
    "the dependence of their results on the number of basis states was not shown , but the authors of @xcite stated that they believed that the model overestimates pseudo - scalar decay constants ( e.g. , for @xmath1 meson they found @xmath108 with uncertainty of 20% ) . even though it is important to investigate what really happens with both @xmath64 and @xmath65 in such a model",
    ", we shall not consider it in the present paper .",
    "we next discuss the heavy - light @xmath0 and @xmath1-wave decay constants . while we were not able to obtain reliable results from ( [ srqm ] ) and ( [ pot ] ) for the @xmath2-waves ,",
    "the situation for @xmath0 and @xmath1-waves is completely different . in figures",
    "[ fsplt ] , [ fpvplt ] , [ fpv2plt ] and [ fv2plt ] we show the dependence on the number of basis states ( @xmath99 ) , for scalar ( @xmath2 ) , two pseudo - vector ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) , and vector ( @xmath111 ) decay constants , respectively .",
    "all the results shown are for the @xmath10 mesons .",
    "as one can see in those figures , in general only a few basis states are needed for results to become independent of @xmath99 , even though the derivatives of the actual @xmath112 and @xmath113 wave functions are singular at spatial origin @xcite .",
    "mev for @xmath66 and @xmath69 as little as 10 pc basis states usually were needed , while to achieve the same accuracy for @xmath67 and @xmath68 requires in general about 50 to 75 pc basis states .",
    "] furthermore , as @xmath99 increases the ho results approach the pc results ( always from below ) which shows that the difference between the two basis sets is slowly vanishing .",
    "however , even with 15 basis states ( when the state energy obtained from the model is essentially equal for both pc and ho wave functions ) , we can still see the difference for @xmath67 ( figure [ fpvplt ] ) and for @xmath68 ( figure [ fpv2plt ] ) .",
    "this reflects the difference in the wave functions obtained from the two basis sets .",
    "the reason why both pc and ho basis states yield almost the same results for @xmath66 ( figure [ fsplt ] ) , even though @xmath84 state is also a @xmath0-wave , is the minus sign in ( [ fi3 ] ) . of course ,",
    "because of the much more rapid convergence , the @xmath114 results are to be preferred over the ho results .",
    "our calculations of @xmath0 and @xmath1-wave decay constants showed that their dependence on the particular choice of the model parameters is significantly smaller than the corresponding dependence of @xmath66 and @xmath65 .",
    "we present the results for @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 mesons in tables [ td ] , [ tds ] , [ tb ] , and [ tbs ] , respectively . through [ tbs ] were obtained with 25 pc basis states , which was more than enough for the accuracy of less than @xmath117 in all cases considered . ] to obtain these results the effective string tension @xmath118 of the model was determined from the observed slope of the @xmath74 trajectory . for a fixed @xmath75 other parameters",
    "were obtained from the spectrum of the known heavy - light states .",
    "experimental meson masses were used in ( [ fi ] ) only when their quantum numbers were unambiguously determined .",
    "else , we used model predictions for the appropriate spin - averaged masses , which are also shown in tables [ td ] through [ tbs ] .    in order to estimate uncertainties introduced by a particular choice of the constituent mass of @xmath119 and @xmath120 quarks",
    ", we have varied @xmath75 in the range from @xmath121 to @xmath122 . for a given @xmath75 , by adjusting @xmath123",
    "we have also varied constituent heavy quark masses in the range of about @xmath45 ( e.g. , @xmath124 was varied in the range from about @xmath125 to about @xmath126 ) .",
    "we emphasize that a good description of the spin - averaged heavy - light meson spectrum was always maintained .",
    "results for the decay constants obtained in this way depend on the assumption for the unknown spin - averaged mass of @xmath127 and @xmath83 mesons ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 states ) . to take into account ambiguities introduced in our results in that way , we have repeated all calculations for this unknown mass in the range from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "errors quoted in tables [ td ] through [ tbs ] reflect the uncertainty due to the unknown @xmath0-wave mass , as well as the uncertainties related to the choice of constituent quark masses discussed above .    as one can see from those tables , in spite of the fact that our calculations are performed for a broad range of constituent quark masses , and also for a wide range of the unknown @xmath0-wave mass , as long as a good description of the observed heavy - light meson spectrum",
    "is maintained , the @xmath0 and @xmath1-wave heavy - light decay constants are all predicted rather precisely .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that the decay constants of strange @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath130 states are slightly smaller than those of the corresponding non - strange states .",
    "the main reason is ( besides the @xmath131 dependence of ( [ fi ] ) ) the light quark dependence of ( [ fi3 ] ) , ( [ fi4 ] ) and ( [ fi6 ] ) . on the other hand , ( [ fi5 ] )",
    "does not depend on the light quark mass , so that @xmath132 factor in ( [ fi ] ) plays a much more significant role , and as a result @xmath68 for the strange states are larger than the ones for non - strange states .",
    "also note that @xmath66 for @xmath133 and @xmath134 are larger than those of the corresponding @xmath127 and @xmath135 states , while it is the other way around in the case of @xmath67 .",
    "the reason for this are the minus and plus signs in ( [ fi3 ] ) and ( [ fi4 ] ) , respectively .",
    "finally , the fact that @xmath136 and @xmath130 @xmath115 states have decay constants smaller than those of the corresponding @xmath10 states , can be easily explained with the @xmath137 dependence of ( [ fi5 ] ) and ( [ fi6 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have examined decay constants of heavy - light mesons within the mock - meson approach @xcite .",
    "we obtained all the relevant expressions in the @xmath14-@xmath14 coupling scheme . for numerical estimates",
    "we employed a simple and widely used relativistic quark model @xcite .",
    "it is based on a spinless salpeter equation with qcd - motivated coulomb - plus - linear potential .",
    "the effective string tension is chosen so that the regge structure of the model in the light - light limit is consistent with experiment , and other parameters are based on the good description of the known spin - averaged heavy - light meson masses .    due to the singular nature of the @xmath138 wave functions at spatial origin @xcite , we were not able to obtain reliable estimates of pseudo - scalar and vector decay constants . on the other hand ,",
    "even though we have allowed for large variations of input parameters , our results show that the model predicts a rather narrow range for all lowest @xmath0 and @xmath1-wave heavy - light decay constants .",
    "such precisely predicted decay constants allow us to estimate the @xmath139 production fractions in @xmath118 decays governed by the @xmath6 transitions under the factorization assumption .",
