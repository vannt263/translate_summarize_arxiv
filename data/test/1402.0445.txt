    "the discovery of a 125 gev scalar boson  @xcite marks a milestone in our understanding of the mechanism of electroweak ( ew ) symmetry - breaking . in order to unambiguously decipher the role exactly played by the corresponding scalar field in breaking the ew symmetry , it is mandatory to measure as accurately as possible the couplings between the higgs boson and all other sm particles we already know , as well as the higgs self - coupling .",
    "this programme has already started and , as new data becomes available , results are continuously updated by the atlas and the cms collaborations  @xcite , as well as by the theoretical community  @xcite .",
    "if no striking direct evidence for new physics will be found within the first few years of the next lhc phase , an accurate extraction of the higgs couplings will become even more important than it is already now : looking for deviations from the sm values will then be our main route to probe ( indirect ) manifestations of new physics .",
    "in other words , if no other new particle beside the higgs is found , one of the main goals in the near future will be precision physics in the higgs sector , using data from the lhc as well as from other experiments ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for discussions ) .    the extraction of the higgs mass , quantum numbers and couplings ( and the related confidence levels ) from lhc data is usually performed by minimizing a chi - squared distribution associated with a global fit to the data .",
    "although theoretically debatable , it is common practice to choose the coefficients representing deviations from the sm values of the higgs couplings as free parameters in this procedure  @xcite .",
    "the results of such fits can be used to directly constrain the parameter space of specific extensions of the sm , or to map deviations from the sm onto the coefficients of higher - dimensional operators , using an effective field theory language .",
    "the ultimate accuracy of this approach will be limited by systematics , statistics , and theoretical uncertainties in the prediction of signal and background cross sections and branching ratios ( these are the quantities used to define the so - called signal strengths , _",
    "i.e. _ the quantities used to obtain the set of higgs couplings for which the best fit to data is obtained ) .",
    "a precise ( in)direct measurement of the top yukawa coupling @xmath1 ( or at least direct sensitivity to it ) is of fundamental importance .",
    "the large mass hierarchy between the different quark generations is not explained in the sm and the top mass being close to the electroweak scale can be interpreted as a hint for tev - scale physics beyond the sm .",
    "well - known examples of modified higgs - top interactions are the two higgs doublet model , the mssm and composite higgs scenarios where the size of the top mass is explained by linear mixing effects with new tev - scale top partners  @xcite . in the latter models ,",
    "the contribution from the higgs vacuum expectation value is less constrained , and the top yukawa can be smaller than the sm value , @xmath4 .    in the light of the currently available data , the aforementioned fits are sensitive to @xmath1 mainly via the measurement of the cross section for higgs production in gluon fusion as well as the higgs to diphoton branching ratio .",
    "both the @xmath5 and @xmath6 processes are loop - mediated , and therefore the extraction of @xmath1 from these measurements is potentially very sensitive to effects of to yet - to - be discovered states ; large deviations from the sm expectations in these channels would be a strong hint of new physics . however , if the higgs is indeed a pseudo - nambu goldstone boson , the effective @xmath7 and @xmath8 couplings can still be sm - like , because higher dimension operators are suppressed by the approximate shift symmetry of the goldstone higgs doublet . in such a case ,",
    "a direct measurement of the top yukawa coupling provides valuable information necessary to break the measurements degeneracy in the extended top sector , where an enlarged ( global ) symmetry is responsible for the `` conspiracy '' to sm - like @xmath7 and @xmath8 couplings  @xcite .",
    "this is especially true when the top partners fall outside the lhc coverage or are masked by experimental systematics .",
    "similar phenomenological implications also hold for exotic models with higgs triplets , see _ e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "the above examples clearly show that , despite being extremely interesting and seminal to higgs physics , the presence of potentially unknown loop effects ( in addition to the lhc being unable to directly measure the total higgs width to satisfactory accuracy ) makes the @xmath7 and @xmath8 not ideal to set theoretically solid bounds on the tree - level @xmath9 coupling in a model - independent way .",
    "it is therefore important to complement these indirect measurements with direct observations of processes where @xmath1 enters already at tree - level .    at the lhc",
    "there are two basic processes which serve this purpose : @xmath10 associated production ( @xmath11 ) and higgs + single - top production ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "an experimental observation of these production channels is challenging because cross sections are in general quite small ( @xmath9 has the smallest cross section among the standard higgs - production processes ) , and , moreover , backgrounds are generically hard to suppress .    not surprisingly , until new techniques were introduced few years ago  @xcite , there were serious doubts even about being able to observe the @xmath13 signal on top of the dominant backgrounds  @xcite in the first place .",
    "associated single - top production  @xcite has an even slightly smaller cross section , and , for similar reasons , has received little attention  @xcite until recently . despite of the aforementioned experimental difficulties , given the importance of the top yukawa as a parameter potentially probing new physics , it is worthwhile to investigate the signatures that might allow its direct extraction .",
    "although current projections indicate that a direct measurement will be challenging ( at least with traditional analysis techniques ) , studying the extent to which @xmath1 can be directly bounded remains a relevant and timely question .",
    "feynman diagrams for tree - level production of single - top + higgs .",
    "the diagram on the left ( right ) is proportional to @xmath14 ( @xmath15).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the purpose of this paper is to perform a phenomenological analysis of a signal based on associated single - top production , and to discuss in how far we can use a successful signal and background analysis to constrain @xmath1 . we will show that despite the fact that the top semileptonic and the @xmath3 branchings are not the dominant ones , it is still possible to obtain limits for the high - luminosity lhc .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] we briefly overview the phenomenology of higgs + single - top production . in sec .",
    "[ sec:14tev ] we detail our analysis and present our results , before we summarize our findings and conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "at the lowest order in perturbation theory , the hadroproduction of higgs + single - top arises from the feynman diagrams shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fd].-quark . for this reason ,",
    "we neglect diagrams with the higgs being emitted off @xmath16-quarks . in the single - top literature",
    ", it is known that a 5-flavour approach compares well with a computation in the 4-flavour scheme , that would allow in turn a better description of the spectator @xmath16-jet  @xcite . ]",
    "these two diagrams show that the top yukawa enters at tree - level , and , moreover , because of the interference taking place at the amplitude level , the squared matrix - element contains a term linear in @xmath17 , where we have parameterized the deviations from the sm higgs couplings @xmath18 as @xmath19 since the higgs insertion at a fermion line introduces a chirality flip , dialling @xmath15 away from its sm value is tantamount to populating different ( anti-)top helicity states that in turn result in different top decay patterns in comparison to the sm .",
    "it is the combination of these effects that motivates the @xmath20 channel as a unique tool for establishing a direct measurement of sign and size of the top yukawa as opposed to @xmath11 .",
    "hence it is no surprise that @xmath20 production has recently received considerable attention from the theory community  @xcite .",
    "recent global fits of the higgs couplings are now ruling out the @xmath21 possibility well above the 95% cl  @xcite , and start constraining the @xmath22 parameter region with available higgs data .",
    "very recently it has also been noticed that a @xmath23-violating component to the top yukawa coupling ( @xmath24 ) can be studied in this channel  @xcite , complementing bounds obtained from low - energy experiments  @xcite .",
    "we do not include this possibility in this paper , but we expect that similar implications can be formulated in the @xmath23-violating context , too .",
    "if also @xmath14 is assumed to be a free parameter , then deviations from the sm expected cross section could be used to set bounds in the @xmath25 plane . here however , we work in the assumption of having a precise measure of @xmath26 : this is a reasonable and realistic assumption , since there are several other processes which will allow to probe @xmath14 independent from the process we are interested in  @xcite , and definitely with a shorter time scale with respect to that needed to accumulate the luminosity required to observe @xmath20 .",
    "as mentioned above , we are interested in the possibility to observe and measure the @xmath20 cross section by looking at the @xmath27 decay .",
    "because this branching ratio depends on @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the measurement of the total cross section with a diphotonic final state can not be straightforwardly translated into a limit on the top yukawa coupling .",
    "we consider two ways to deal with this issue .",
    "the first possibility is to just rely on the fact that by the time when this measurement will be possible , the lhc will have completed a `` legacy '' measurement of the @xmath28 branching , which can be used as an input for our proposed analysis .",
    "alternatively , one can also include the dependence on the @xmath29 factor entering in @xmath28 , assuming that only the top yukawa is allowed to float ( in which case the total higgs width stays approximately unchanged once @xmath14 is fixed , because the dominant @xmath30 and @xmath31 partial widths are fixed ) .",
    "we will report two different confidence limits for the yukawa coupling : the first limit follows form a sm - like @xmath27 branching ratio and the second one includes the back - reaction of the modified top yukawa coupling on the higgs decay phenomenology .",
    "we will derive these constraints from characteristic angular observables of the exclusive @xmath20 final state after showering , hadronization and signal vs. background enhancing selection cuts .",
    "in our study we have identified several variables sensitive to the size of @xmath29 . for this paper , we have chosen @xmath32 , _ i.e. _ the distance between the @xmath16 jet and the reconstructed higgs boson in the @xmath33 plane as a single discriminating variable , since this observable optimizes the discriminative power between different signal hypothesis in the presence of realistic cuts , as we will show in the next section .",
    "we will also discuss the sensitivity of @xmath34 to the value of @xmath29 .    to understand the typical kinematics of the final state , we start by reminding the reader that the cross section for @xmath20 production is minimal for a sm - like top yukawa value ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this is due to destructive interference between the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] becoming maximal  @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to study some leading - order parton - level distributions  @xcite in presence of very generic cuts : @xmath36 jets are obtained clustering the final state partons with  @xcite , using the anti-@xmath37 algorithm  @xcite with @xmath38 .",
    "first of all we notice that the light jet associated to the light quark current is typically produced at relatively small transverse momentum ( @xmath39 peaks at @xmath40gev ) and high rapidity @xmath41 .",
    "hence cutting away events with central light jets will not deplete significantly the signal , helping therefore in enhancing the signal vs. background ratio .",
    "we also notice that typically the top quark and the light jet lie in opposite hemispheres , and as a consequence the heavy objects in the final state are distributed such that the top quark is typically further away in rapidity from the light jet than the higgs boson . in the next section , we will make use of these properties of the signal s kinematics to design a cut flow that affects the signal rates as less as possible .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : yt_dyth_lo ] the leading - order distribution of the reconstructed top ( and anti - top ) rapidity is shown and @xmath42 production . ] for the two representative values of @xmath29 that will be used in the following , after applying the cuts in eq .",
    "[ eq : basiccuts ] .",
    "since we want to concentrate on shape differences , here we show unit - normalized curves , but we stress that the total cross - section for @xmath43 is a factor @xmath44 1.5 larger than the sm value . together with this observation , the plot in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : yt_dyth_lo ] shows that the interference term is significantly bigger in size , and negative , when tops are central : consequently it is clear that the smaller @xmath29 is , the more central the top quarks are , and , conversely , tops are fairly uniformly distributed in the central rapidity region when @xmath35 .",
    "these observations apply as well for the reconstructed higgs ( not shown ) : in the sm scenario , @xmath45 is essentially flat for @xmath46 $ ] , whereas for `` bsm '' scenarios the higgs rapidity tends to peak at 0 .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : yt_dyth_lo ] we show how this pattern translates to the rapidity distance between the top and the higgs , which is related to the observables in which eventually we will be interested , _ i.e. _ distances between the reconstructed higgs and the hardest @xmath16-jet . in the sm case",
    "the negative interference affects very sizeably the @xmath47 region , creating a visible shape difference between the two signal hypothesis . as we will observe in sec .",
    "[ sec:14tev ] , the slope shown in the ratio panel on the right persists even in presence of the other cuts that will be introduced to enhance @xmath48 , and affects also @xmath49 and @xmath50 too , which we will use to set exclusion limits .    in anticipation of the main results",
    ", we also show how the @xmath51 distributions look when we split the total cross section by requiring the @xmath16-jet to be harder ( softer ) than the light jet .",
    "[ fig : dyth_jb_bj_lo ] shows that , when @xmath52 , the above picture is not qualitative changed .",
    "however , for @xmath53 , the higgs boson and the top quark are much closer in rapidity when @xmath43 , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dyth_jb_bj_lo ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that to have hard @xmath16-jets , the parent tops need to be more central : when @xmath35 , this situation is strongly disfavored by the negative interference , as commented above , whereas a large part of the cross section in the @xmath43 case is concentrated in this phase - space region , as shown in the main panels . in the next section",
    "we will use this very large shape differences in @xmath54 distributions , in the regime where @xmath53 , as an extra - handle to set stronger constraints on the top yukawa .",
    "in the following we perform a hadron - level analysis of the process @xmath55 , @xmath56 , at 14  tev with a target luminosity of 3/ab .",
    "this will allow us give an estimate of the discriminative power that is encoded in angular observables after realistic selection criteria have been applied .",
    "we investigate an exclusive final state that is obviously the cleanest channel to observe @xmath20 production yet statistically limited due to the small @xmath28 branching ratio .",
    "side - band analysis techniques are applicable and we can expect that systematic uncertainties in this final state are small compared to multi @xmath16-tagged events that have been discussed in the literature in the context of parton - level analyses  @xcite . we include the following dominant irreducible and fake ( jet faking @xmath16-jets , jets faking photons ) backgrounds : @xmath57+jets , @xmath58+jets , @xmath59+jets , @xmath60+jets , @xmath61+jets , @xmath62+jets , @xmath63+jets , and @xmath64+jets .",
    "all event samples are generated with  @xcite , using the default @xcite parton densities , and are subsequently showered with  @xcite .",
    "quite obviously , a lot of systematic limitations that are discussed in the context of @xmath65 analyses also impact this analysis , most notably the issues of heavy flavor contributions that are still under investigation presently  @xcite .",
    "the final state we consider in this section will clearly minimize the sensitivity to these effects compared to multi @xmath16-tagged final state , but heavy flavor production and tagging still deserves a more detailed investigation in the context of @xmath20 production once the theoretical and experimental questions raised in  @xcite are settled .",
    "a realistic in - depth analysis of the corresponding uncertainties is currently not available and beyond the scope of this section , therefore our results need to be understood with a pinch of salt .",
    "our selection criteria closely follow the event topology that results from the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] : we typically deal with a central @xmath16 jet and a forward jet that are balanced by the higgs .",
    "since we only have electromagnetic calorimetry in the central part of the detector ( @xmath66 ) , we lose a fraction of the signal due to the reconstruction in the central part of the detector .",
    "this is unavoidable also for other decay modes , _",
    "e.g. _ for @xmath67 , because @xmath16-jet identification relies on vertexing in the central part of the detector too",
    ". we will continue to focus on @xmath43 for illustration and also comment on @xmath68 at a later stage .",
    "the latter case is typically more complicate to constrain when the back - reaction on @xmath6 is included .         in the actual analysis",
    ", we define isolated leptons and photons for tracks which have less than 10% energy deposit relative to the tracks transverse momentum in a cone of size @xmath69 .",

    "we ask here for _ exactly _ one lepton , two photons , and two jets ( this reduces the reducible backgrounds but also the signal ) .",

    "<S> after the discovery of the 125 gev scalar boson with gauge properties similar to the standard model higgs , the search for beyond the sm interactions will focus on studying the discovered particles coupling properties more precisely and shedding light on the relation of fermion masses with the electroweak vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the large mass of the top quark and the sm - predicted order one top yukawa coupling is a natural candidate for bsm physics , though experimentally challenging to constrain . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that investigating angular correlations in @xmath0 production provides an excellent handle to constrain the top yukawa coupling @xmath1 via direct measurements , even when we focus on rare exclusive final states . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a hadron - level analysis and show that we may expect to constrain @xmath2 at 95%-99% confidence level at the high luminosity lhc using semi - leptonic top decays and @xmath3 alone , by employing a two - channel measurement approach . </S>"
