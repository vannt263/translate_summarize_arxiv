    "it is easy to know that the weak form ( [ vf1])-([vf2 ] ) is also equivalent to the following variational problem : find @xmath28^d\\times l_0 ^ 2(\\omega)$ ] such that @xmath29 for all @xmath23^d$ ] and @xmath24 .",
    "the unique solvability of ( [ vf3])-([vf4 ] ) follows directly from that of the ( [ vf1])-([vf2 ] ) .",
    "the wg method refers to a general finite element technique for partial differential equations where differential operators are approximated as distributions for generalized functions .",
    "this method was first proposed in @xcite for second order elliptic problem , then extended to other partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "weak functions and weak derivatives can be approximated by polynomials with various degrees .",
    "the wg method uses weak functions and their weak derivatives which are defined as distributions .",
    "the most prominent features of it are :    * the usual derivatives are replaced by distributions or discrete approximations of distributions . *",
    "the approximating functions are discontinuous .",
    "the flexibility of discontinuous functions gives wg methods many advantages , such as high order of accuracy , high parallelizability , localizability , and easy handling of complicated geometries .",
    "the above features motivate the use of wg methods for the stokes equations .",
    "it can easily handle meshes with hanging nodes , elements of general shapes with certain shape regularity and ideally suited for hp - adaptivity . in @xcite , wang",
    "considered wg methods for ( [ vf1])-([vf2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , in @xcite , they presented wg methods for the brinkman equations , which is a model with a high - contrast parameter dependent combination of the darcy and stokes models .",
    "the numerical method of @xcite is based on the traditional gradient - divergence variational form for the brinkman equations . in @xcite",
    ", we presented a new wg scheme based on the gradient - gradient variational form .",
    "it is shown that this scheme is suit for the mixed formulation of darcy which would present a better approximation for this case .",
    "in fact , for complex porous media with interface conditions , people often use brinkman - stokes interface model to describe this problem , which is an ongoing work for us now . in order to present a more efficient wg scheme ,",
    "we prefer to utilize this gradient - gradient weak form to approximate the model . in order to unify the weak form of this interface problem , we need the numerical analysis results of this form for stokes problem .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the numerical analysis of methods based on the variational form ( [ vf3])-([vf4 ] ) has never been done before .",
    "therefore in this paper , we propose a wg method based on the weak form ( [ vf3])-([vf4 ] ) of the primary problem .",
    "in addition , if we choose high order polynomials to approximate the model and use schur complement to reduce the interior dof of the velocity and pressure by the boundary dof , the total dof of this new method is less than the scheme of @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shall introduce some preliminaries and notations for sobolev spaces .",

    "this section also contains some local @xmath30 projection operators and then derives some approximation properties which are useful in a convergence analysis . in section 5 , we derive an error equation for the wg finite element approximation .",
    "optimal - order error estimates for the wg finite element approximations are derived in section 6 in an @xmath31-equivalent norm for the velocity , and @xmath30 norm for both the velocity and the pressure . in section 7",
    ", we present some numerical results which confirm the theory developed in earlier sections .",
