    "x - rays from cool stars are a manifestation of magnetic fields generated by the internal dynamos . this by now classical view has not changed despite the discovery of new x - ray phenomenology and the development of new theoretical concepts with which to explain the production of x - rays around stars ( e.g. , accretion , outflows , fluorescence , etc ) .    however , with increasing detector sensitivities and the advent of high - resolution spectroscopy , `` stellar environmental issues '' have become of central interest in the area of pre - main sequence stars . the interplay between accretion disks and stellar magnetic fields leads to disk instabilities , ionization and heating of circumstellar material , chemical reactions in cool molecular gas , accretion flows from the disk to the star , outflows , and jets , in all of which x - rays either play a key role or at least provide important diagnostic access .    limitations of present - day instrumentation are , however , evident .",
    "the following sections summarize selected topics of x - rays from cool stars that have been addressed in recent years using high - resolution spectroscopy from _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra_.",
    "to derive location , structure , and extent of stellar magnetic fields , only radio interferometric methods are available for direct imaging , with their own severe limitations .",
    "x - ray photometric studies have made use of rotational modulation or of eclipses ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while appealing for specific studies of individual objects ,",
    "such methods are constrained to exceptional cases or the fortuitous eclipse geometry of binaries , and are complicated by intrinsic variability ( flares , new emerging flux ) or the superposition of x - rays from two objects . on the other hand ,",
    "x - ray spectroscopic density measurements have opened a new avenue toward assessing coronal structure .",
    "he - like triplets show ratios between the `` forbidden '' and the `` intercombination '' line fluxes that are sensitive to the electron density @xmath0 , the forbidden line being suppressed in high - density environments @xcite .",
    "under coronal temperature and density conditions , transitions of cv , nvi , ovii , neix , mgxi , and sixiii are diagnostically useful , with some caveats .",
    "first , the density - sensitive range for the latter two exceeds @xmath1",
    "@xmath2 , values that are probably uncommon to most solar - like stellar coronae .",
    "second , the densities to which he - like transitions are sensitive increases with the formation temperature of the ion .",
    "low densities can not be explicitly measured in very hot plasmas . and third , the maximum formation temperatures of all ions mentioned above are in the range of 110  mk , while active stars reveal dominant electron temperatures up to several tens of mk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several fe lines are also sensitive to @xmath0 ( e.g. , prominent lines of fexvii and fexxi ; @xcite ) although blends and inaccuracies in the atomic physics parameters make their application challenging .",
    "fe lines were already accessible to euv spectroscopy performed by the euve satellite @xcite .",
    "triplet flux ratios measured in low - activity stars point to densities common to the solar corona , i.e. , @xmath3  @xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) at temperatures of a few mk .",

    "@xmath6 most high - density measurements straddle the low - density limit of the respective ion .",
    "this circumstance makes the measurements extremely vulnerable to inaccuracies in the atomic physics tabulations , and to unrecognized blends in some of the lines .",
    "slight modifications then have a dramatic effect on the implied @xmath0 , as can be nicely seen in the analysis presented by ref .",
    "this work concluded , from a detailed study of the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum of capella , that @xmath0 measured by the most reliable fexxi line ratio , @xmath7 , is compatible with the low - density limit of this diagnostic ( i.e. , @xmath8  @xmath2 ) .",

    "excess line broadening ( above thermal and rotational broadening , fig .",
    "[ fig : chung04_f6 ] ) can be ascribed to a radially extended corona , with a coronal scale height of at least one stellar radius , which is consistent with expected scale heights of hot coronal plasma on this star .",
    "it is quite well established that the solar corona and the solar wind show elemental compositions at variance with the composition of the solar photosphere . in the solar corona ,",
    "elements with a first ionization potential ( fip ) above @xmath15  ev ( e.g. , c , n , o , ne , ar ) show photospheric abundance ratios with respect to hydrogen , while elements with a smaller fip ( e.g. , si , mg , ca , fe ) are overabundant by a factor of a few ( `` fip effect '' , @xcite ) .",
    "current thinking is that a fractionation process , probably involving electric and/or magnetic fields , waves , or pressure gradients , occurs at chromospheric levels where low - fip elements are predominantly ionized and high - fip elements are predominantly neutral ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
