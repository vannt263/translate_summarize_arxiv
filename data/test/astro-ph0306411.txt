    "x - ray astronomy is at the very heart of the enormous progress that our astrophysical knowledge of the universe has undergone over the last decades .",
    "x - rays are emitted in a wide range of physical situations in the universe , invariably linked to the presence of hot gas and strong gravitational fields .",
    "these phenomena , largely unsuspected in the early days of x - ray astronomy , are nowadays seen to be ubiquitous in a variety of astronomical objects .",
    "x - ray observations of previously known objects have often revealed phenomena ( e.g. , the presence of an accreting black hole ) just not seen at other wavelengths . in addition , new sources serendipitously discovered in x - ray surveys have uncovered new classes of objects , totally inconspicuous at optical wavelengths .",
    "one datum that illustrates the impact of x - ray observations in astronomy is that 20% of the papers published by the 3 main astrophysics journals in 2002 ( astrophysical journal , monthly notices of the royal astronomical society and astronomy & astrophysics ) contain the `` x - ray '' keyword in the abstract .",
    "the 2002 nobel prize in physics given to riccardo giacconi ( father and leader of x - ray astronomy ) , is also a sign of the good health reached by this discipline , as it is one of the very few granted to astronomers .",
    "x - ray astronomy began in 1962 , when a rocket flown to detect the moon in scattered x - rays from the sun , discovered instead the first extra - solar x - ray source ( sco x-1 ) and the cosmic x - ray background ( giacconi et al . 1962 ) .",
    "this already showed that the universe out there could be radically more energetic than what was known before , as sco x-1 had a much larger x - ray to optical flux ratio than the sun .",
    "more rockets followed this pioneering discovery , but there was a basic limitation in the amount of observing time available for observations in a single flight .",
    "_ uhuru _ ( which means _ freedom _ in swahili ) was the first orbiting x - ray observatory .",
    "it was launched from italy s san marco station in kenya on the 12th of december of 1970 , coinciding with the independence day of this country ( thence the name ) .",
    "the _ uhuru _",
    "payload weighed less than 60 kg .",
    "it scanned the sky for over 2 years and produced the first all - sky catalogue of x - ray sources , containing a few hundred of them .",
    "subsequent work demonstrated that outside the galactic plane , most of the sources were active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and clusters of galaxies . in the galactic plane , _ uhuru _ found x - ray binaries , supernova remnants and other diffuse structures .",
    "this rough picture ( but with varying fractions of objects ) still describes to zero - th order the present knowledge of the x - ray universe .",
    "this early generation of x - ray orbiting observatories ( which also included _",
    "heao-1 _ and more recently _ ginga _ , japanese word for milky way ) were equipped with a mechanical collimator as the only means to limit the field of view covered by the ( usually gas - filled proportional counter ) detectors , without any further optics .",
    "this provided a very rough angular resolution , of the order of several degrees , which ultimately limited the sensitivity of the observatory because of confusion of fainter sources .",
    "proper imaging x - ray optics was featured for soft x - rays ( below 4.5 kev ) with the _ einstein observatory _ first . with an angular resolution of a couple of arc minutes , _ einstein _ discovered many new x - ray sources ( including many at cosmological distances ) , showing that the word _",
    "experiment _ was in the way of being replaced by _ observatory _ in x - ray missions . _",
    "einstein _ made it possible to discover new classes of sources by their x - ray emission , resolved the spatial structure of the intracluster gas in galaxy clusters and produced large catalogues of x - ray sources that were subsequently used to conduct detailed astrophysical studies .",
    "it also showed , for the first time , that a significant fraction of stars are x - ray emitters .",
    "_ rosat _ , in some sense a successor to _ einstein _ , deepened our knowledge of the x - ray universe , by conducting first an all - sky survey ( this yielded the , so far , largest catalogue of x - ray sources , exceeding 50000 ) , and for almost a decade , targeted observations of a full range of astronomical objects , from comets to distant qsos .",
    "focusing x - ray photons is not an easy task . in a standard reflecting optical telescope , photons are directed almost normally to the reflector s surface and collected in the focal plane .",
    "if the same setup is used for x - rays , they end up either transmitted or absorbed , but never reflected .",
    "grazing incidence is needed to achieve total reflection for x - rays , the maximum angle with respect to the surface being of a few degrees for a photon of @xmath0 .",
    "reflection becomes more difficult at higher photon energies , as the angle for total reflection becomes smaller and the mirrors need to be placed almost parallel to the optical axis .",
    "it is easy to see that the effective area that a photon sees is very small with a mirror placed in grazing incidence , and therefore several ( or many ) mirrors are nested one inside each other to increase the collecting area .",
    "it is also clear that an x - ray focusing telescope of higher energy photons will have less effective area and longer focal length than a similar one focusing soft x - ray photons .",
    "the start of the nineties brought x - ray observatories able to produce images with photons of up to 10 kev , such as the japanese _ asca _ were launched .",
    "_ asca _ also opened the door to a more modern type of x - ray detector ( the _ charge coupled device _ or ccd ) that ended up burying the proportional counters .",
    "ccd - based detectors deliver an order of magnitude better spectral resolution for single photons than proportional counters . at the energy of the fe k@xmath1 line ( 6.4 - 6.7 kev ) ,",
    "the resolution of @xmath2 achieved by these detectors enables a detailed study of the physical environment where it is produced .",
    "other x - ray observatories have been launched during the 1990 s , including _ bepposax _ ( which also featured higher energy detectors sensitive to many tens of kev ) and _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) which is tailored to timing analysis of bright sources .",
    "however , at the turn of the new millenium , both _",
    "nasa _ and _ esa _ decided to launch their respective large x - ray observatories : _ chandra _ ( launched july 1999 ) and _ xmm - newton _",
    "( launched december 1999 ) .",
    "the coincidence of operations between both missions ( being just by chance , as _ chandra _ was over - delayed for several years ) has brought what can be called the _ golden age _ of x - ray astronomy . by virtue of their respective designs _",
    "is mostly an imaging observatory , while _ xmm - newton _ has its major capabilities at spectroscopy .",
    "having both of them operating at the same time has opened a huge window to x - ray astrophysics , whose dimensions are just beginning to be realized after the first few years of operations .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ is an x - ray observatory launched and operated by the european space agency ( esa ) , with instruments contributed and funded by esa member states and nasa ( usa ) .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ was successfully launched by an ariane 5 on the 10th of december of 1999 .",
    "its orbit is highly eccentric with a period of @xmath3 days .",
    "although the original _ xmm - newton _ project was approved for 2 years of scientific operations , all systems and payloads are designed to last for @xmath4 years . specifically , fuel ( hydrazine ) is currently thought to last for more than that .",
    "in fact , an extension of the _ xmm - newton _ operations has already been approved to 2006 with a further 2 year period being revised by mid 2003 . for comparison with early missions , the full _ xmm - newton _",
    "satellite weighs more than 3000 kg .",
    "currently , the _ xmm - newton _ spacecraft is operated by esoc at darmstadt ( germany ) , but the instruments and science operations in general are managed from vilspa ( villafranca del castillo , spain ) .",
    "[ xmm ]    _ xmm - newton _ consists of 3 co - aligned grazing incidence x - ray telescopes ( jansen et al . 2001 ) , with angular resolution of 4 - 6 arcsec ( fwhm ) and 13 - 15 arcsec ( half energy width ) . each x - ray telescope nests 58 grazing incidence mirror pairs , with a total collecting area of @xmath5 ( see fig  [ xmm ] for a schematic of the x - ray optics in the xmm - newton x - ray telescopes )",
    ". one of these telescopes focuses all x - rays into a single spectroscopic imaging detector ( epic - pn , strder et al .",
    "2001 ) , which has a pixel size of 4 arcsec and covers a field of view of about 30 arcmin in diameter .",
    "about half of the x - rays focused by the other two telescopes go undispersed to similar imaging spectrographs called epic - mos ( turner et al .",
    "the epic instruments can measure the energy of individual photons with a resolution of @xmath6 .",
    "epic is sensitive to photons from 0.2 to 12 kev and can detect x - ray sources as faint as @xmath7 in the 0.5 - 2 kev band in a few tens of kiloseconds ( ks ) .",
    "its main limiting sensitivity in soft x - rays is caused by confusion , due to the modest angular resolution of the x - ray telescopes . at higher photon energies",
    "the main limiting factor is photon counting , with an expected confusion limit in the 2 - 10 kev band reached in a several ms exposure only .",
    "the two x - ray telescopes that focus the x - rays into the epic - mos detectors are equipped with difraction gratings working by reflection .",
    "these disperse the remaining x - rays according to their wavelength and these are recorded in a further chain of ccd detectors .",
    "this wavelength - dispersive instrument is called the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) and delivers a spectral resolution @xmath8 in first order dispersion ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) in the soft x - ray domain ( 5 - 35  , or 0.3 - 2.4 kev ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the rgs can be viewed in terms of a source with 0.5 - 2 kev flux of @xmath10 producing peak s / n@xmath4 per spectral resolution element in 100 ks .",
    "it is therefore an instrument designed to observe bright sources with relatively high spectral resolution .",
    "the moderate angular resolution of the xmm - newton mirrors makes it possible to obtain integrated moderate resolution of _ extended _ sources , a capability that is producing extremely interesting results ( see later ) .    besides that",
    ", _ xmm - newton _ has a co - aligned optical / uv telescope ( the optical monitor - om ) which operates in the range from 1600 to 6600@xmath11 . at its focal plane",
    "the om has a photon counting device ( mason et al .",
    "2001 ) , which delivers time - resolved information for the detected photons .",
    "the field of view of the om is 17 arcmin , with a point - spread - function of fwhm between 1.3 and 2.5 arcsec , with a limiting sensitivity of 23.5@xmath12 for 1000 sec integration .",
    "the om is equipped with a number of uv and optical filters , plus low resolution uv and optical grisms , whose calibration is being conducted at the time of writing this report .",
    "all three _ xmm - newton _ instruments ( epic , rgs and om ) are simultaneously operated .",
    "the ground segment operations of _ xmm - newton _ are conducted by the soc at villafranca del castillo ( spain ) with the assistance of an esa member - state funded consortium called _ survey science centre _ ( ssc ) .",
    "the ssc tasks include the development of science analysis software tasks in collaboration with the soc ; the pipeline processing of all _ xmm - newton _ data and the identification of the _ serendipitous _ sources discovered by _ xmm - newton_. this last task is specially demanding , as it is likely that _ xmm - newton _ will find about 50000 new x - ray sources per year . identifying and cataloguing these data will constitute a major legacy of _ xmm - newton _ ( see watson et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "esa has already released the first version of the _ xmm - newton _ catalogue provided by the ssc , which contains over 30000 good - quality x - ray sources .",
    "some of these sources are identified thanks to the extensive archival search conducted by the ssc . at the time of writing this report the ssc has imaged in various optical filters a large fraction of fields that contain the catalogued sources . besides that",
    ", well over 500 of these x - ray sources have been spectroscopically identified . all this optical imaging and spectroscopic information",
    "will be included in future versions of the _ xmm - newton _ catalogue , delivering an extremely powerful tool to investigate the x - ray sky .",
    "one of the areas where the impact of _ xmm - newton _ has been strongest is the study of x - ray emission from `` normal '' stars .",
    "the possibility that stars without compact companions could be x - ray emitters had not been initially foreseen . though some normal stars had been detected by previous experiments ( e.g. , topka et al . 1978 ) , only after the observations by _",
    "einstein _ was it fully realised that many solar - type stars emitted soft x - rays ( vaiana et al .",
    "equally surprising was the discovery that hot ob stars also appeared to be substantial soft x - ray sources .",
    "the x - ray emission from low - mass stars was quickly interpreted in terms of coronal activity , similar to that observed in the sun , but on a much larger scale .",
    "many m - type stars were found to display relatively strong x - ray emission , which correlated with other indicators of activity , such as emission in h@xmath1 or the caii doublet ( noyes et al .",
    "1984 ; vilhu 1984 , fleming et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "it was also found that there was a strong correlation between age and x - ray activity . in this sense ,",
    "the all - sky survey by _ rosat _ greatly changed the previous view on the evolution of low - mass stars towards the main sequence .",
    "it was seen that many stars not displaying the typical characteristics of t tauri stars could be identified as very young objects because of their x - ray emission ( e.g. , neuhuser 1997 ) .",
    "this lead to the discovery of whole new associations of young stars . as previous missions lacked spectral resolution in the soft x - ray range , _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ offer the possibility of obtaining , for the first time , information about the physical causes of this emission .",
    "coronal activity in chromospherically active low - mass stars is thought to result in x - ray emission through mechanisms similar to those observed in the sun .",
    "observations with _ xmm - newton _ provide spectra showing lines from a large variety of elements ( o , ne , mg , fe , n , etc ) , many of them in at least two different ionisation states . from them ,",
    "coronal abundances , which are in many cases very different from the stellar atmospheric abundances , are derived . in the sun ,",
    "elements with low first ionisation potential are overabundant with respect to their photospheric abundances , while elements with high first ionisation potential are not . in a survey of rs cvn binaries (",
    "tidally locked binaries containing a highly active slightly evolved g - k star ) , audard et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find that the most active stars display a behaviour opposite to that seen in the sun , suggesting that fractionation mechanisms should be revised .",
    "they indicate that this opposite effect is seen in all stars with high coronal activity , while stars with lower activity seem to present an effect similar to the sun .",
    "simultaneous observations of @xmath13 gem , an rs cvn binary with a k1iii primary , with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and the vla have allowed the discovery of a correlation between the radio luminosity of a large flare and the time derivative of the x - ray luminosity ( gdel et al .",
    "this relationship is observed in solar flares , where it is known as the neupert effect , and supports flare mechanisms causing chromospheric evaporation .",
    "the presence of x - ray emission from young ( pre - main - sequence ) stars is now recognised as a widespread phenomenon ( feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) . it is assumed to be a consequence of the same magneto - centrifugal processes that drive the outflows and winds associated with classical t tauri stars ( e.g. , shu et al .  1994 ) .",
    "large - scale surveys with _ xmm - newton _ will allow an understanding of these phenomena . as a first example , favata et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have observed the l1551 star forming complex .",
    "they find that the characteristics ( both temporal evolution and spectrum ) of classical t tauri stars and weak - lined t tauri stars are very different , suggesting that while weak - lined t tauri stars show an enhanced version of the coronal activity seen at older ages , classical t tauri stars have a different x - ray emission mechanism , related to their accretion disks .",
    "although emission from low mass stars can be understood in terms of coronal activity , the existence of relatively soft x - ray emission from massive stars came as a bit of a surprise ( harnden et al .",
    "models trying to explain it invoke hydrodynamic shocks resulting from intrinsic instabilities in their radiatively driven winds ( see feldmeier et al .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ rgs spectra have allowed the exploration of physical conditions in the regions where the emission is produced .",
    "observations of the o4ief star @xmath14 puppis have provided confirmation that the x - ray emission consists mostly of broad emission lines from h - like and he - like charge states of n , o , mg and si , as well as ne - like ions of fe ( kahn et al .  2001 ) . in this object with a very strong radiative wind , x - ray emission reaching us seems to be produced at large distances from the star .",
    "[ zpup ]    conversely , the x - ray spectrum of the b0.2v mk standard @xmath15 scorpii is not very consistent with standard models .",
    "emission lines in its _ xmm - newton _ rgs spectrum are as narrow as the instrumental profile , suggesting that they are produced much closer to the star ( mewe et al .",
    "x - ray emission shows a hot component corresponding to a temperature in excess of @xmath16k .",
    "this is supported by a _",
    "observation of the same star by cohen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who suggest that the spectrum of @xmath15 scorpii is intermediate between those of o - type stars and coronal emitters . as there is rather strong evidence against the possibility of a cool companion for @xmath15 scorpii , a model in which dense clumps in the wind stall and decelerate , perhaps falling back onto the stellar surface , such as that presented by howk et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , is preferred .",
    "the hard x - rays would then originate in bow shocks around those clumps .    in some cases ,",
    "emission from relatively hot stars seems to be due to late - type companions .",
    "simultaneous observations of castor with _",

    "castor c is a pair of m1v stars , both of which appear to be moderately active ( stelzer et al .",
    "both castor a and castor b contain an a - type star and a low - mass companion , but their emission appears typical of coronal activity in the low mass stars ( stelzer & burwitz 2003 ) .    another interesting result obtained with _",

    "an example is wr 110 , detected with _",
    "xmm - newton _ by skinner et al .",
    "surprisingly , the x - ray spectrum of this very hot star also shows a hard component which can not be explained with current models .    in some cases ,",
    "a relatively hard x - ray spectrum is produced when the winds of two massive stars forming a close binary collide .",

    "( rauw et al .  2002 ) .",
    "x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) are systems in which high energy radiation is emitted as a consequence of the accretion of material from a donor star ( in most cases , a hydrogen - burning `` normal '' star ) onto the surface of a compact object ( see lewin et al .  1995 , for extended reviews ) .",
    "binary systems in which the accreting compact object is a white dwarf are generally considered as a separate subclass , known as cataclysmic variables , though there are no strong physical reasons for this separation .",
    "xrbs emit most of the x - ray flux detected from normal galaxies , including the milky way .",
    "they have been discovered in large numbers by previous satellites and now a sufficiently large sample exists for population studies to be statistically significant ( e.g. , helfand & moran 2001 ) .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ offers several potentialities for their study . on the one hand",
    ", it opens up the opportunity of obtaining spectra of galactic sources with moderate resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio . on the other hand , because of its large collecting area and moderately high spatial resolution , it provides an excellent opportunity for studying the populations of nearby galaxies .",
    "last but not least , _ xmm - newton _ offers the possibility of obtaining x - ray spectra of faint galactic sources , opening the door to studies of low - luminosity accreting binaries .",
    "xrbs are generally divided into two main subclasses , high mass ( hmxbs ) and low mass ( lmxbs ) , depending on the nature of the donor star ( either an ob star or g@xmath18 m spectral type ) . additionally ,",
    "depending on the temporal behaviour , they can be divided in persistent and transient sources .",
    "lmxbs containing an accreting neutron star can be either persistent or transient , but systems with black holes are generally transient .",
    "classical low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) consist of a neutron star with a moderately strong magnetic field ( @xmath19 g ) accreting from a low - mass star .",
    "the light - curves of these objects are rather complex ( displaying temporal features such as eclipses and dips ) .",
    "there is a large variety of behaviours among lmxbs , likely due to the complexity of their accretion geometries , which has prevented the creation of a unified model . as a matter of fact , while all lmxbs observed with _ asca",
    "_ could be well fit with a two component model , a blackbody representing the accretion disk and an extended comptonising region ( church & balucinska - church 2001 ) , this model failed to fit observations of several lmxbs with _",

    "2001 ) .",
    "many lmxbs also display bursts , very rapid increases in the x - ray flux followed by exponential declines ( typically lasting seconds to minutes ) .",
    "the bursts are interpreted as thermonuclear explosions on the stellar surface , after material has accumulated due to accretion ( lewin et al .  1993 ) . during this bursts ,",
    "x - ray emission from the vicinity of the neutron star dominates that coming from the disk .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ has allowed the study of the accretion environments of low mass x - ray binaries , with the discovery of complex narrow absorption features in their x - ray spectra , corresponding to h - like and he - like ions of o and fe , and likely other elements ( cottam et al .",

    "they derive very high n / o ratios , which they interpret as proof of strong interactions during the formation history of this binary .",
    "lmxbs containing a black hole ( and a few transient sources containing neutron stars ) are generally termed soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) or x - ray novae .",
    "this is because they display very strong x - ray and optical outbursts ( generally also accompanied by radio emission ) separated by long periods of quiescence ( see tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) .",

    "these sources are variable on short timescales , but their luminosities are typically much higher than those observed in galactic and magellanic cloud xrbs , approaching in many cases @xmath26erg s@xmath25 . as this luminosity is much higher than the eddington limit for a neutron star or a low - mass black hole , it seems to require massive black holes with masses of the order of @xmath27 ( generally called intermediate - mass black holes , as their masses are between those of stellar - mass black holes and the supermassive objects at the heart of galaxies ) .",
    "severe problems are found when trying to understand the formation mechanism of such black holes , leading to the thought that perhaps ulxs can be explained as normal xrbs in which the x - ray emission is beamed towards the observer , requiring thus much lower fluxes ( king et al .",

    "a very important result obtained with _ xmm - newton _ has been the discovery of quasi - periodic modulation in the flux from an ulx in m82 ( strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ) .",
    "such modulation must arise in the immediate vicinity of the compact object and represents evidence against beaming .",
    "unfortunately , because of the relatively low spatial resolution , the identification of the ulx is not completely certain and a simultaneous observation with _",
    "seems desirable .",
    "further evidence supporting intermediate - mass black holes has been collected from analysis of the spectra of two ulxs in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 1313 .",
    "the blackbody temperatures inferred from the fits are a factor of ten lower than those of typical sxts , suggesting rather more massive black holes ( miller et al .",
    "one of the very first discoveries of x - ray astronomy was that clusters of galaxies are strong x - ray emitters ( see sarazin 1986 for an early review and mushotzky 2001 for a much more up - to - date compilation ) .",
    "their x - ray spectrum is well fitted by plasma emission at a temperature of @xmath28 , which includes thermal bremsstrahlung and line emission , most notably the fe k emission line at @xmath29 .",
    "the inferred fe abundance is about @xmath30 solar , with possible gradients across the cluster , but remarkable homogeneity across the cluster population .",
    "clusters ( and groups ) of galaxies are therefore filled with enriched gas ( likely deposited by the mass loss of the member galaxies ) , which appears to be trapped in the cluster potential well .",
    "the intracluster medium appears to be close to hydrostatic equilibrium except for the core ( with a few @xmath31 ) , cluster gas is isothermal ( or perhaps with a slowly decaying temperature ) out to the distances where x - ray emission can be detected ( less than the virial radius ) .",
    "relaxed clusters often exhibit a _ cooling flow _ phenomenon , whereby the gas in the central part of the cluster is significantly cooler and the density higher probably due to a highly subsonic inflow amounting typically to @xmath32 ( see fabian 1994 for an extensive review ) .",
    "one of the best studied clusters with _ xmm - newton _ is a1795 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "this cluster shows a smooth gas density profile along the lines of the @xmath34 profile adopted for many clusters ( arnaud et al .",
    "the temperature of the gas is seen to be constant from 0.1 to 0.4 virial radii , but dropping significantly at smaller distances from the cluster centre .",
    "this is now seen as a common feature in many clusters , like a496 ( tamura et al .",
    "2001 ) , a1413 ( pratt & arnaud 2002 ) .",
    "the possibility of mapping the intracluster gas structure with unprecedent detail is now also opening big questions on its physical state . in their detailed analysis of the @xmath35 a1413 cluster ,",
    "pratt & arnaud ( 2002 ) argue that the gas departs from hydrostatic equilibrium when approaching the virial radius , as expected from the very long timescales involved .",
    "they also find evidence for a cuspy central density profile ( at variance of the usually assumed @xmath34-profile ) .",
    "the mass profile of the cluster , as derived under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , is not far from the predictions of standard cold dark matter computations",
    ".    another important contribution of _ xmm - newton _ to cluster science has been illustrated with the observations of the @xmath36 cluster cl0016 + 16 , a working horse for the use of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect to determine accurate values of the hubble constant .",
    "worrall & birkinshaw ( 2003 ) have been able to derive accurate values for the gas temperature ( to within 2.5% ) and of the emission measure ( electron density integrated along the line of sight ) to within a similar accuracy .",
    "the subsequent revised value of @xmath37 is now in agreement with the latest determinations using the _ hubble space telescope _ and the cosmic microwave background power spectrum obtained by wmap .      for many years it has been thought that clusters build up from smaller structures , as predicted by popular cosmological scenarios .",
    "for instance , evidence for hierarchical merging in the coma cluster was provided by _",
    "observations of x - ray emission of a merging sub - structure ( white , briel & henry 1993 ) .    with its much improved sensitivity , _",
    "xmm - newton _ is able to map intracluster gas down to very low surface brightness limits and therefore to strengthen or disprove the merging hypothesis .",
    "indeed , the very first epic images of the coma cluster ( briel et al .",
    "2001 ) confirm the presence of the probably infalling lump from the sw ( around ngc 4839 ) already detected by _ rosat _ , but they also find a further lump probably ahead of this one on its infall into the coma cluster .",
    "n - body simulations do predict indeed that the infall into large clusters of galaxies proceeds along filamentary structures !",
    "the structure of the gas around ngc 4839 does show clear traces of being into its first infall into coma ( neumann et al .",
    "the tail of the x - ray emission is very hot ( @xmath38 ) and indeed hotter than the temperature of the galaxy itself .",
    "together with a displacement of the x - ray emission with respect to the galaxy ngc 4839 ( well placed at the centre of the optical group ) this provides confirmation of the subgroup gas being ram pressure stripped in its infall into the coma cluster .",
    "evidence for filamentary structures infalling onto clusters is also seen in _ xmm - newton _ observations of the cluster a 85 ( durret et al 2003 ) .",
    "early _ rosat _ reports on a large @xmath39 filamentary structure towards the south of the central cd galaxy of a 85 are confirmed , together with a determination of the gas temperature of around @xmath40 .",
    "this suggests that the filamentary structure is made of a chain of several galaxy groups .",
    "further evidence in favour of clusters being built by merging blocks comes from observations of distant clusters .",
    "de filippis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) observed the cluster cl 0939 + 4713 at @xmath41 and showed that it exhibits significant gas structure , with the gas in between the two dominant galaxies being the hottest .",
    "this implies a largely non - relaxed state with a likely collision between the two merging blocks within a few million years .",
    "hashimoto et al . ( 2002 ) observed the very distant cluster rx j1053.7 + 5735 at @xmath42 and also detected a double structure suggestive of a merger .",
    "therefore , _ xmm - newton _ has brought evidence for merging activity in clusters of galaxies , particularly at significant redshifts . assessing the incidence of mergers in the building up of galaxy clusters ( there are examples of dynamically relaxed clusters at high redshift , see arnaud et al .",
    "2002 , for observations of rx j1120.1 + 4318 at @xmath43 ) has just started but will ultimately provide the most direct evidence on how large - scale structure forms in the universe .",
    "perhaps one of the most unexpected discoveries by _ xmm - newton _ has been the challenge to the standard picture of the cooling flow phenomenon .",
    "the cooling time in the centres of galaxy clusters is significantly smaller than the age of the universe , and therefore that gas will cool if no other phenomena prevent it ( see , e.g. , fabian 1994 for a comprehensive review ) . maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium with the hotter outer gas",
    "implies that gas should be steadily flowing inwards , increasing the density towards the cluster centre .",
    "mass deposition rates are of the order of @xmath44 , which integrated over a hubble time result in a substantial contribution to the mass of a large galaxy .",
    "cooling flows manifest themselves as a peaked surface emissivity at the centre of the cluster , where the x - ray spectrum shows cooler gas .",
    "they occur almost invariably in cd clusters ( i.e. , those dominated by a large central - dominant early type galaxy ) , but very rarely happen in more non - relaxed structures , possibly due to the disruption of cooling flows by mergers .",
    "[ m87 ]    previous to the operation of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ there were doubts about the physics governing cooling flows .",
    "conduction need to be suppressed to prevent the gas from thermalising in the hotter cluster environment , but lower temperature gas was unambiguously seen . the most intriguing question was ( and still is ) where does all this gas go .",
    "cd galaxies present at the centres of cooling flow clusters are red and , although they do form some stars ( see the extensive work by cardiel 1999 on star formation in cooling flow clusters ) , they certainly do not form @xmath45 _ normal _ stars every year . a high pressure ambient as that present in cooling flows",
    "could favour the formation of low - mass stars .",
    "a major _ xmm - newton _ result has been to show that the gas in cooling flow clusters does not cool below a temperature which is 1/2 to 1/3 of the outer intracluster medium temperature ( see , e.g. , kaastra et al .",
    "2001 , peterson et al .",
    "2001 , tamura et al .",
    "2001 , peterson et al .",
    "2003 , sakelliou et al .",
    "cluster gas at temperatures @xmath46  kev should cool mostly through fe l lines , which should be very strong .",
    "instead they are almost absent of the _ xmm - newton _ rgs spectra .",
    "the amount of gas that cools is probably 1/10 of the gas expected from simple cooling flow models ( fabian & allen 2003 ) , suggesting a much modest role of cooling flows in galaxy formation ( see also molendi & pizzolatto 2001 ) .    the reasons for that are still unclear .",
    "both conduction and heating by the central source ( usually a powerful agn ) have been revived .",
    "conduction should probably be decreased by the presence of magnetic fields , as a temperature gradient is indeed seen .",
    "heating is also non - trivial , as it should deposit heat uniformly over a large volume , but on the contrary _ chandra _ images show lots of structure in cluster cores .",
    "a further complicating point is that , despite the fact that the amount of gas seen at temperatures of millions of degrees is much smaller than predicted by the simplest cooling flow models , _ fuse _ observations reveal in some cooling flow clusters large ovi emission lines ( oegerle et al .",
    "2001 , bregman 2003 , priv comm ) .",
    "the amount of gas cooling at a few @xmath47k is paradoxically in agreement with the _ cooling flow _ models , but the few million degree gas is missing .",
    "there is clearly much to learn in the coming years from this phenomenon .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are the most populous class of x - ray sources in the universe , particularly at high galactic latitude . the large variety of agn manifestations results in distinctive x - ray emission properties .",
    "radio - loud agns were early claimed to have flatter x - ray spectra than radio - quiet ones ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ) , with flat spectrum radiosources having an even flatter x - ray spectrum ( canizares & white 1989 ) .",
    "this is now understood in terms of radio - loud agns being absorbed by cold gas ( sambruna et al .",
    "1999 ) , plus relativistic beaming affecting the x - ray emission in core - dominated radio sources .",
    "radio - quiet type 1 agn ( seyfert 1 galaxies and qsos ) where optical broad emission lines are seen and type 2 agn ( seyfert 2s ) where these broad components are not seen in unpolarized light , should have different x - ray properties . indeed , the simplest version of the agn unified scheme ( antonucci 1993 ) , where the type 1/type 2 dichotomy results from different viewing directions of the same ( or very similar ) central engine , predicts that x - rays emerging from the nucleus would be directly seen in type 1 agns but absorbed / scattered in type 2 agns .    the standard agn model , i.e. , that of a supermassive black hole fed by a geometrically thin accretion disk and collimated jets along the rotation axis , has found some of its best support in the x - ray observations .",
    "hard x - ray photons at a rate of @xmath48 are very difficult to produce by other means in a galactic centre .",
    "additionally , some spectral features , as a broad relativistic fe k@xmath1 emission discussed below , are distinctive tracers of accretion onto massive compact objects .",
    "x - ray emission from agn is characterised by an underlying power law with photon index @xmath49 ( on the steep side for radio - quiet agn ) , which probably rolls over at energies @xmath50 ( see the review by mushotzky et al .",
    "1993 summarizing the situation pre-_xmm - newton _ ) . for radio - quiet objects and those which are radio - loud but",
    "the beaming towards the observer is not important , this power law is interpreted as the compton up - scattering of the uv photons produced in the accretion disk by the disk s relativistic electron atmosphere .    an fe k@xmath1 emission line at 6.4 - 6.7 kev is the most prominent emission feature , along with a high - energy ` bump ' at @xmath51 ( pounds et al . 1990 ) , both of them probably arising from reflection of the x - rays in some thick material . for seyfert 1 galaxies",
    "the equivalent width of the fe line lies in the range 100 - 300 ev , while for seyfert 2 galaxies the emission line is much stronger ( up to 1 kev of equivalent width ) , in particular in compton - thick seyfert 2s .",
    "the most striking feature of the fe line is that it is very broad ( inferred doppler velocities up to @xmath52 ) . in the best studied case of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 it exhibits a relativistically broadened shape interpreted in terms of doppler shifts produced by the disk rotation , aberration and gravitational redshift in the red horn due to the proximity to the black hole s event horizon ( tanaka et al .",
    "similar shapes were observed in other seyfert 1 galaxies , suggesting that this is a relatively general feature of type 1 agns . in the",
    "best studied seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. ngc 1068 ) , _ asca _ showed a more complex emission line structure ( iwasawa et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "agn often exhibit photoelectric absorption features in excess of those produced by cold gas in our galaxy .",
    "radio - loud agns at high redshifts , often exhibit large cold ( neutral ) absorbing gas columns ( cappi et al .",
    "1997 ) but in radio - quiet agn the situation is more complex . in this case ,",
    "type 1 agn appear to have little neutral absorbing gas ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) , but they often exhibit signs of ionised gas along the line of sight in the form of absorption edges , most notably ovii k at 0.74 kev and oviii k at 0.87 kev ( reynolds 1997 , george et al . 1998 ) . on the contrary",
    "seyfert 2 agn usually display large absorbing columns of neutral gas ( smith & done 1996 ) , which is attributed to the `` dusty torus '' that the unified agn scheme predicts to hide the broad line region .",
    "the average good correlation between optical spectral properties of radio quiet agn and the amount of neutral absorbing gas along the line of sight has been clearly shown in risaliti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the basis of an [ oiii]-selected sample of agn ( the [ oiii ] emissivity is believed to originate further away than any obscuring material in agn , and therefore is regarded as an isotropic measure of the true intrinsic agn luminosity ) .",
    "_ chandra _ and to a larger extent _ xmm - newton _ have provided a qualitative leap forward in the study of fe k lines , due to the large increase ( in particular for _ xmm - newton _ ) of effective area at @xmath53 with respect to previous missions while preserving or improving the spectral resolution .",
    "the best - studied seyfert 1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 has indeed been the subject of several long _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "fabian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) discuss a 300 ks observation , where they confirm the existence of a very broad fe line feature .",
    "a careful physical modeling of this feature shows that the line emissivity comes in two parts : the blue part of the line arises from the outer accretion disk ( radius @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the gravitational radius of the black hole with mass @xmath56 ) , but to account for the very extended red tail displayed by the line ( extending down to 4 kev ) a very concentrated emission at much lower radii is required .",
    "this unambiguously confirms early claims based on _ asca _ that reflection features arise from radii as close as @xmath57 from the black hole , requiring a rapidly rotating ( kerr ) hole .",
    "in fact wilms ( 2001 ) caught the same source in the `` low '' state where the red wing of the fe line dominates , suggesting extraction of energy from the spinning black hole through magnetic fields . in any case",
    "it is clear that the fe line diagnostic of mcg6 - 30 - 15 can only be understood in the context of reflection in an accretion disk around a kerr black hole .",
    "observations of many other seyfert galaxies have shown that the profile of the fe line varies very much from source to source .",
    "in general , the reflection fe line arises either in the inner part of the accretion disk , where it is likely to be highly ionised and broad , and/or at much more distant regions ( perhaps the `` dusty torus '' ) where it betrays mostly neutral fe with a narrow line .",
    "prototypical cases showing both a narrow component at 6.4 kev and a broad component centered at 6.7 kev are mkn 205 ( reeves et al . 2001 ) and ngc 5506 ( matt et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "[ mcg ]    interestingly , one of the cases claimed to have a broad fe line with _ asca _ data , ngc 5548 , does only show a neutral narrow line in _ xmm - newton _ observations ( pounds et al .",
    "although the fe line appears to vary less than the continuum in some of the best - studied seyferts ( such as mcg6 - 30 - 15 ) , there are reports of varying fe lines .",
    "guainazzi ( 2003 ) studies non - simultaneous _ asca _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ bepposax _ observations of eso198-g24 , and he reports a broad component appearing and then fading away along with a narrow component .",
    "it must also be stressed that the `` holy grail '' of using reverberation mapping ( i.e. , the response of reflected components , such as the fe line , to continuum variations ) to measure the mass of the black holes involved in agn , has turned out to be rather complex .",
    "the fe line intensity does not trivially follow the continuum variations and therefore much work is needed before this technique can be applied .",
    "a very lively debate has arisen since the launch of _ xmm - newton _ on whether or not there are weak , relativistically broadened emission lines corresponding to c , n and o at soft x - ray energies .",
    "this stems from the use of the grating spectrographs both in _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , which provide spectral resolutions of the order of 200 - 500 .",
    "branduardi - raymont et al .",
    "( 2001 ) were the first to suggest the presence of these features in the rgs spectra of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and mkn 766 , as an alternative to a standard warm absorber picture . using a _ chandra _ observation of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) identified a number of spectral features that were expected from a warm absorber , and even some of them only expected in fe atoms trapped in dust grains , supporting the dusty warm absorber picture and no evidence for broad emission lines .",
    "mason et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have recently reported an analysis of rgs data on mkn 766 , where it is shown that broad relativistic emission lines of c , n and o give a better fit to the data than a dusty warm absorber .",
    "as of today , higher signal to noise _ xmm - newton _ data over a larger bandpass appear to favour the presence of relativistic soft x - ray emission lines , and higher spectral resolution _ chandra _",
    "data appear to favour the dusty warm absorber interpretation .",
    "but the story continues @xmath58      the higher spectral resolution provided by rgs has enabled the possibility of studying the ionized absorbers in agn with much more detail .",
    "sako et al .",
    "( 2001 ) conducted the first of such detailed analyses on the qso iras 13349 + 2438 , which was already suspected from the combined _ rosat _ , _ asca _ and optical data to have a complex absorption structure along the line of sight .",
    "the rgs spectrum shows a large number of absorption lines of c , n , o , ne with one and two electrons , as well as a number of fe lines in various ionisation states .",
    "most remarkably , an unresolved transition array ( uta ) of inner - shell lines of fe m is detected for the first time at x - ray wavelengths , which might be confused , at the lower resolution of non - dispersive ccd imaging spectrographs , with an absorption edge .",
    "absorption lines of fe are detected in fe vii - fe xii and in fe xvii - fe xx , but not in the intermediate ionisation states fe xiii - fe xvi .",
    "this suggests the existence of two distinct absorbers , a low ionisation one , which happens to be outflowing with a velocity @xmath59 and a high ionisation absorber basically at rest with the qso .",
    "the low ionization outflowing absorber implies ( for normal dust to gas ratio ) a reddening coincident with the optical one , but the high ionisation absorber , with a much larger column density , does not appear to have any dust .",
    "[ iras ]    similar deep studies have been conducted on other targets ( e.g. , blustin et al .",
    "2002 ) , revealing almost invariably the presence of utas , and a complex ( at least two - phase ) ionisation structure for the absorbers .",
    "it must be stressed that we are likely probing the gas in between the broad - line region and the `` obscuring torus '' in a manner that no other observational strategy could do .",
    "the existence of a cosmic x - ray background ( cxrb ) was among the very first discoveries of x - ray astronomy ( giacconi et al .",
    "its spectrum was well measured by the heao-1 mission ( marshall et al .",
    "1980 , gruber 1992 ) and fits remarkably well a thermal bremsstrahlung model at a temperature of @xmath60 . at galactic latitudes",
    "@xmath61 the cxrb is remarkably isotropic claiming for a true cosmological origin ( see fabian & barcons 1992 for a review ) .",
    "most of the energy density in the cxrb resides at @xmath60 , an energy which is not accessible to sensitive enough instrumentation in the current era .",
    "below 1 kev the galaxy ( and probably a local hot bubble ) dominates the x - ray intensity , and the extragalactic component is shielded by the interstellar medium , making it difficult to measure . in spite of this ,",
    "deep _ rosat _ observations resolved @xmath62 of the cxrb in the 1 - 2 kev ( hasinger et al . 1998 ) while _ chandra _ has resolved practically 90% of this and @xmath63 of the 2 - 7 kev cxrb ( mushotzky et al . 2000 ) .    the lack of spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background ruled out the presence of substantial amounts of intergalactic gas at the very high temperatures needed to produce the cxrb through thermal bremsstrahlung ( barcons et al .",
    "1991 ) . finding the sources that produce the cxrb , their astrophysical nature , their cosmic evolution , spatial clustering and so on has been since then the main objective of cxrb studies .",
    "the most popular models for the cxrb make use of the unified model for agn , and assume a mixture of unabsorbed ( presumably type 1 ) and absorbed ( presumably type 2 ) objects as a function of redshift @xmath64 ( comastri et al .",
    "1995 , gilli et al .",
    "2001 ) .    medium sensitivity ( mason et al .",
    "2000 ) and deep ( lehmann et al . 2002 ) surveys carried out with _ rosat _ revealed that at soft x - ray energies the x - ray sky is dominated by agns , most of which are type 1 seyferts and qsos . a small fraction of the agn were type 2 and other narrow emission line galaxies ( e.g. , starburst galaxies ) .",
    "however , due to its bandpass limited to soft x - ray photons _ rosat _ missed most of the sources absorbed by h columns in excess to @xmath65 .",
    "the large field of view of the epic cameras ( @xmath66 in diameter ) makes _ xmm - newton _ a very powerful tool to conduct x - ray surveys .",
    "the survey science centre ( ssc ) is carrying out a series of serendipitous surveys in order to characterise the content of the x - ray sky at different depths .",
    "at high galactic latitudes , 3 samples of @xmath67 sources each , selected at 0.5 - 4.5  kev fluxes of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 will provide a major handle on this task .",
    "a number of surveys are being conducted besides the ssc ones , most of which are discussed in the proceedings of the workshop _ x - ray surveys , in the light of the new observatories _ held in santander during 4 - 6 september 2002 ( astronomische nachrichten , vol 324 , issues 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the axis programme is providing a substantial leap forward in the _ xmm - newton _ ssc medium sensitivity survey .",
    "this is a flux limited survey at @xmath71 , in the 0.5 - 4.5 kev band , with a source density of @xmath72 , which has the goal of covering @xmath73 both in the north and in the south .",
    "preliminary results were presented in barcons et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and an update can be found in barcons et al .",
    ".    [ lh ]    the deepest x - ray survey conducted by _ xmm - newton _ so far is in the lockman hole area , with a total exposure approaching 1000 ks ( adding the payload verification , ao-1 and ao-2 data ) .",
    "the scope of this survey is not only to detect the faintest sources , particularly at hard x - ray energies where confusion is still unimportant and _ xmm - newton _ is 5 - 10 times more efficient than _ chandra _ , but more importantly to obtain x - ray spectra of the faintest sources .",
    "a preliminary account , based on 100 ks data , is presented in hasinger et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ is also providing evidence that the one to one association of type 1 agns with unabsorbed sources and type 2 agns with absorbed sources fails clearly in some cases .",
    "for example barcons et al .",
    "( 2003b ) have shown that the h1320 + 551 z=0.068 seyfert 1.9 galaxy ( and therefore with a broad line region putatively obscured ) does not show any signs of neutral or ionised gas along the line of sight .",
    "this is in direct contradiction to the unified agn model .    on the opposite side ,",
    "type 1 qsos are found which display large absorbing columns of neutral gas ( e.g. , georgantopoulos et al .",
    "2003 ) , while none or very little was expected .",
    "a possible explanation to this is that x - ray absorption occurs very close to the central engine where dust just sublimates and therefore the optical spectrum is unaffected by the surrounding material .",
    "this might be a non - isolated situation , as explained by mateos et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in an analysis of the x - ray spectra of xms sources , where a fraction of type 1 agns do require absorbing columns along the line of sight .      if anything , the deep observation of hasinger et al .",
    "( 2001 ) demonstrates that the basic picture for the origin of the cxrb , based on absorbed sources , is roughly correct .",
    "indeed , some @xmath74 of the faint sources detected show some hint of absorption in their x - ray colours , in agreement with the general expectations .",
    "quantitatively , however , the situation is still far from clear .",
    "one of the most striking results obtained from the optical identification of _ chandra _ deep surveys is that the redshift distribution of type 2 agn is peaked at significantly lower redshifts ( @xmath75 ) than that of type 1 agn ( @xmath76 ) ( hasinger 2002 ) .",
    "similarly , in the xms all type 2 agns are concentrated at low redshifts , while the type 1s reach @xmath77 .",
    "this probably means that the models for cxrb need some revision . following this , franceschini , braito & fadda ( 2002 )",
    "have suggested that type 1 agn arise in the rare highest peaks of the density field in the universe , but that type 2 agn result from the evolution and merging of the very massive galaxies , a process that occurs later in the cosmic history .      a still intriguing issue raised by the new observatories and studied in detail by _ xmm - newton _ is the existence of optically inactive but x - ray luminous galaxies .",
    "such objects were first highlighted in a _",
    "_ deep survey by mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , as early type galaxies with a large x - ray to optical ratio .",
    "comastri et al .",
    "( 2002 ) conducted a multi - wavelength study of one of these objects discovered in their hellas2xmm survey , which shows no optical or infrared emission lines , but does show a rather hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "they concluded that the counterpart galaxy at @xmath78 hosts a completely obscured active nucleus .",
    "severgnini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have recently reported on the study of 3 of these objects discovered in the ssc bright source survey .",
    "their x - ray properties are varied , but in all cases reflecting clearly the presence of an x - ray luminous agn . in that work",
    "it is shown that the emission lines related to the more or less obscured agn are diluted with the galaxy light and therefore very weak and inconspicuous in some cases .",
    "all this appears to support previous suspicions that most , if not all , galaxies host a black hole in their center , many of them active but obscured .",
    "obscured accretion is probably 3 times more frequent in the universe than unobscured accretion , if the cxrb models are roughly correct . a detailed accounting on the black hole density",
    "can then be inferred by assuming a radiative efficiency of the black holes ( typically 10% ) and compared to other independent estimates of the local black hole density .",
    "fabian ( 2003 ) concludes that the estimate based on the cxrb and with what is known from the redshift distribution of obscured sources , converges towards @xmath79 , a value which is consistent with local estimates .",
    "obscured accretion onto black holes is therefore important , although the `` hidden '' black hole mass is of the same order than that seen in unobscured agn .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ is making a big effort in observing gamma ray bursts ( grb ) following alerts provided by other higher - energy observatories .",
    "the absolute minimum reaction time reached is 6 - 8 hours after the alert . in all observations",
    "( conducted as target of opportunity observations , and therefore immediately public ) the grb afterglow has been detected and much has been learnt on this phenomenon from the x - ray data .",
    "perhaps the most interesting case is that of grb011211 ( identified to occur in a galaxy of @xmath80 at @xmath81 ) observed by _ xmm - newton _ for 27 ks , 11 hours after its detection by _",
    "bepposax_. during the first 10 ks of that observation , the epic x - ray spectrum showed emission lines which reeves et al .",
    "( 2002 ) identified as mg xi , si xiv , sxvi , ar xviii and ca xx but at a significantly blueshifted velocity @xmath82 ( the detection confidence of these lines has been challenged by rutledge & sako 2003 though ) . if the reeves et al .",
    "( 2002 ) interpretation is correct , then this would provide direct evidence for outflowing material , favouring the model of the collapse of a massive star for grbs .",
