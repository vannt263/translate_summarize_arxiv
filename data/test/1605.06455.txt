    "synchronization is a dynamical process where two or more interacting oscillatory systems end up with identical movement . in 1665 huygens experimented with maritime pendulum clocks and discovered the anti - phase synchronization of two pendulums clocks mounted on the common frame  @xcite .",
    "since then , synchronization has become a basic concept in nonlinear and complex systems @xcite .",
    "such systems include , but are not limited to , musical instruments , electric power systems , and lasers .",
    "there are numerous applications in mechanical  @xcite and electrical  @xcite engineering .",
    "new applications are found in mathematical biology such as synchronous variation of cell nuclei , firing of neurons , forms of cooperative behavior of animals and humans  @xcite .",
    "recently , huygen s experiment has been widely discussed and several experimental devices were built  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that two real mechanical clocks when mounted to a horizontally moving beam can synchronize both in - phase and anti - phase  @xcite . in all these experiments synchronization",
    "was achieved due to energy transfer via the oscillating beam , supporting huygen s intuition  @xcite .",
    "one of the rapidly developing areas in between physics and mathematics , is the topic of @xmath1-symmetry , which has started as a way to characterize non - hermitian hamiltonians in quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the key idea is that a linear schrdinger operator with a complex - valued potential , which is symmetric with respect to combined parity ( @xmath2 ) and time - reversal(@xmath3 ) transformations , may have a real spectrum up to a certain critical value of the complex potential amplitude . in nonlinear systems ,",
    "this distinctive feature may lead to existence of breathers ( time - periodic solutions localized in space ) as continuous families of their energy parameter .",
    "the most basic configuration having @xmath1 symmetry is a dimer , which represents a system of two coupled oscillators , one of which has damping losses and the other one gains some energy from external sources .",
    "this configuration was studied in numerous laboratory experiments involving electric circuits  @xcite , superconductivity  @xcite , optics  @xcite and microwave cavities  @xcite .    in the context of synchronization of coupled oscillators in a @xmath1-symmetric system ,",
    "one of the recent experiments was performed by bender et al .",
    "these authors considered a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian system describing the motion of two coupled pendula whose bases were connected by a horizontal rope which moves periodically in resonance with the pendula .",
    "the phase transition phenomenon , which is typical for @xmath1-symmetric systems , happens when some of the real eigenvalues of the complex - valued hamiltonian become complex .",
    "the latter regime is said to have _ broken _ @xmath1 symmetry .    on the analytical side ,",
    "dimer equations were found to be completely integrable  @xcite .",
    "integrability of dimers is obtained by using stokes variables and it is lost when more coupled nonlinear oscillators are added into a @xmath0-symmetric system .",
    "nevertheless , it was understood recently @xcite that there is a remarkable class of @xmath0-symmetric dimers with cross - gradient hamiltonian structure , where the real - valued hamiltonians exist both in finite and infinite chains of coupled nonlinear oscillators .",
    "analysis of synchronization in the infinite chains of coupled oscillators in such class of models is a subject of this work .    in the rest of this section , we describe how this paper is organized .",
    "we also describe the main findings obtained in this work .",
    "section [ model ] introduces the main model of coupled pendula driven by a resonant periodic movement of their common strings .",
    "see figure [ pendulapic ] for a schematic picture . by using an asymptotic multi - scale method , the oscillatory dynamics of coupled pendula",
    "is reduced to a @xmath0-symmetric discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation with gains and losses .",
    "this equation generalizes the dimer equation derived in @xcite .",
    "section [ symmetry ] describes symmetries and conserved quantities for the @xmath0-symmetric dnls equation .",
    "in particular , we show that the cross - gradient hamiltonian structure obtained in @xcite naturally appears in the asymptotic reduction of the original hamiltonian structure of newton s equations of motion for the coupled pendula .",
    "section [ breathers ] is devoted to characterization of breathers , which are time - periodic solutions localized in the chain .",
    "we show that depending on parameters of the model ( such as detuning frequency , coupling constant , driving force amplitude ) , there are three possible types of breather solutions . for the first type",
    ", breathers of small and large amplitudes are connected to each other and do not extend to symmetric synchronized oscillations of coupled pendula . in the second and third types ,",
    "large - amplitude and small - amplitude breathers are connected to the symmetric synchronized oscillations but are not connected to each other .",
    "see figure [ branches ] with branches ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , where the symmetric synchronized oscillations correspond to the value @xmath4 and the breather amplitude is given by parameter @xmath5 .",
    "section [ zero - equilibrium ] contains a routine analysis of linear stability of the zero equilibrium , where the phase transition threshold to the broken @xmath0-symmetry phase is explicitly found .",
    "breathers are only studied for the parameters where the zero equilibrium is linearly stable .",
    "section [ variational ] explores the hamiltonian structure of the @xmath0-symmetric dnls equation and characterizes breathers obtained in section [ breathers ] from their energetic point of view .",
    "we show that the breathers for large value of parameter @xmath6 appear to be saddle points of the hamiltonian function between continuous spectra of positive and negative energy , similar to the standing waves in the dirac models .",
    "therefore , it is not clear from the energetic point of view if such breathers are linearly or nonlinearly stable . on the other hand",
    ", we show that the breathers for smaller values of parameter @xmath6 appear to be saddle points of the hamiltonian function with a negative continuous spectrum and finitely many ( either three or one ) positive eigenvalues .    section [ stability ] is devoted to analysis of spectral and orbital stability of breathers . for spectral stability",
    ", we use the limit of small coupling constant between the oscillators ( the same limit is also used in sections [ breathers ] and [ variational ] ) and characterize eigenvalues of the linearized operator .",
    "the main analytical results are also confirmed numerically .",
    "see figure [ spectra ] for the three types of breathers .",
    "depending on the location of the continuous spectral bands relative to the location of the isolated eigenvalues , we are able to prove nonlinear orbital stability of breathers for branches ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "we are also able to characterize instabilities of these types of breathers that emerge depending on parameters of the model . regarding branch ( a ) , nonlinear stability analysis is not available by using the energy method .",
    "our follow - up work @xcite develops a new method of analysis to prove the long - time stability of breathers for branch ( a ) .",
    "the summary of our findings is given in the concluding section [ conclusion ] , where the main results are shown in the form of table 1 .",
    "a simple yet universal model widely used to study coupled nonlinear oscillators is the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model @xcite .",
    "it describes a chain of classical particles coupled to their neighbors and subjected to a periodic on - site potential . in the continuum approximation",

    "the fk model is known to describe a rich variety of important nonlinear phenomena , which find applications in solid - state physics and nonlinear science  @xcite .",

    "figure [ pendulapic ] shows schematically that each array of pendula is connected in the longitudinal direction by the torsional springs , whereas each pair of pendula is connected in the transverse direction by a common string .",
    "newton s equations of motion are given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 correspond to the angles of two arrays of pendula , dots denote derivatives of angles with respect to time @xmath9 , and the positive parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe couplings between the two arrays in the longitudinal and transverse directions , respectively .",
    "the type of coupling between the two pendula with the angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 is referred to as the _ direct coupling _ between nonlinear oscillators ( see section 8.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "we consider oscillatory dynamics of coupled pendula under the following assumptions .    *",
    "the coupling parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are small .",

    "a similar derivation for a single pair of coupled pendula is reported in @xcite .    using the algorithm in @xcite and restricting the scopes of this derivation to the formal level , we write the truncated system of equations for the remainder terms : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are uniquely defined . bounded solutions to the linear inhomogeneous equations ( [ linear - equation ] ) exist if and only if @xmath29 for every @xmath30 .",
