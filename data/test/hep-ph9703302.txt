    "in @xmath0 scattering at hera interactions between photons of small virtuality @xmath2 and protons produce jets of high transverse energy @xmath3 .",
    "the presence of this hard scale @xmath3 allows the application of perturbative qcd to predict cross sections for the production of two or more high-@xmath3 jets which can be confronted with experimental data .",
    "this offers the opportunity to test qcd and to constrain the structure of the colliding particles .    at leading order ( lo ) qcd two distinct processes",
    "are responsible for the production of jets . in the direct photon process",
    ", the photon interacts as a point - like object with a parton in the proton , whereas in the resolved process the photon acts as a source of partons which then scatter with the partons coming from the proton .",
    "both lo processes are characterized by having two outgoing jets of large transverse energy .",
    "studies of dijet photoproduction at hera have shown that both classes of processes are present for the case of quasi - real photons , i.e. photons of extremely small virtuality @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the comparison of theoretical predictions @xcite with these @xcite and more recent experimental data @xcite have given us some confidence that the parton distribution functions for the real photon available in the literature @xcite are consistent with the dijet production data .",
    "the parton content of photons with virtuality @xmath5 is reasonably constrained by data from deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this is not the case for a photon target with non - zero , although small , virtuality @xmath2 .",
    "the only measurement for the virtual photon structure function available so far has been performed by the pluto collaboration at petra @xcite .",
    "they measured the structure function @xmath6 for @xmath7 gev@xmath8 and @xmath9 gev@xmath8 as a function of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the virtuality of the probing virtual photon , whereas @xmath2 always denotes the virtuality of the probed virtual target photon ) .",
    "more and better data should come from lep2 @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    "several models exist for describing the @xmath11-evolution equations of the parton distributions and the input distributions at @xmath12 with changing @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these constructions use essentially the same methods as have been applied for the parton distributions of real photons .",
    "this way some smooth behavior towards @xmath5 , where previous results for the real photon should hold , is guaranteed . in @xcite",
    "this construction allows a calculation of the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) for virtual photons in lo and nlo .",
    "it incorporates a purely perturbative contribution and a non - pointlike hadronic contribution .",
    "unfortunately these pdf s for @xmath13 are not available in a form that parametrizes the @xmath11 evolution . such parametrized pdf s for virtual photons have been presented recently by two groups @xcite , but unfortunately only in lo .",
    "these two models differ somewhat in their method of extrapolation to @xmath14 , in the choice of the input distribution and the choice of the input scale @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore the pdf s of glck , reya and stratmann ( grs ) @xcite present distributions only for @xmath15 flavors , whereas schuler and sjstrand ( sas ) give pdf s for @xmath16 flavors @xcite .",
    "we expect these two structure function sets to be detailed enough so they can be tested in photoproduction experiments with virtual photons .",
    "first preliminary data have been presented by the zeus @xcite and the h1 @xcite collaborations .",
    "zeus studied the dijet cross section for @xmath17 gev in the range of @xmath18 .",
    "events with @xmath19 are assumed to be dominated by the direct process whereas events with @xmath20 give the resolved component",
    ". then the ratio of the direct - enriched and resolved - enriched cross section is measured as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath21 gev@xmath8 . in the h1 experiment",
    "the inclusive one - jet cross section is measured as a function of @xmath3 and rapidity @xmath22 for various @xmath2 bins @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the resolved component decreases relative to the contribution from the direct photon processes as the virtuality of the photon increases .",
    "some theoretical studies of the single inclusive and dijet inclusive cross section in lo have been presented recently @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that in nlo calculations the distinction between direct and resolved photoproduction becomes ambiguous . in this order , a large contribution in the nlo direct cross section",
    "is subtracted from the direct component and combined with the lo resolved term thus producing the scale ( @xmath23 ) dependence of the pdf s of the photon .",
    "therefore both components are related to each other through the factorization scale @xmath24 at the photon leg which determines the part of the nlo direct contributions to be absorbed into the resolved component .",
    "the @xmath24 dependence of the remaining nlo direct contribution cancels to a large extent against the dependence in the resolved cross section coming from the photon structure function .",
    "this connection has been worked out in detail @xcite and studied numerically for real photoproduction with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "it is clear that this cancellation of the scale dependence must take place also for @xmath14 .",
    "so , for a consistent calculation up to nlo one needs to superimpose both contributions , the nlo direct and at least the lo resolved cross section , both computed with the same scale .",
    "the subtraction of the large contribution in the direct cross section which is shifted to the resolved term is defined only up to finite , non - singular terms in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "these finite terms may be fixed in a way that a smooth behavior towards the limiting case of real photons ( @xmath25 ) is achieved where these finite terms are usually defined in the @xmath27 subtraction scheme . for a complete nlo calculation",
    "we must include the nlo hard scattering parton - parton cross sections for the direct ( here one of the ingoing partons is the photon with virtuality @xmath14 ) and for the resolved process together with the two - loop evolved structure function of the proton and photon with virtuality @xmath14 .",
    "in this paper we shall work out the subtraction in the nlo direct contribution and superimpose the remaining direct contribution and the resolved cross section up to nlo .",
    "we study this cross section and the two contributions as a function of @xmath2 for various inclusive one- and two - jet cross sections .",
    "of particular interest is the behavior of the resolved component as a function of @xmath2 and the question at which @xmath2 the sum of direct and resolved cross sections approaches the unsubtracted direct cross section which one expects to give the correct description at sufficiently large @xmath2 .",
    "the outline is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe how to subtract the singular terms in the nlo direct cross section connected with the collinear singularity of the @xmath28 contribution . here",
    "we also define the finite terms which depend on the subtraction scheme used for @xmath25 .",
    "our result concerning the @xmath2 dependence of various one- and two - jet cross sections are presented in section 3 . in this section",
    "we also compare with the preliminary data from zeus @xcite .",
    "section 4 contains a summary and an outlook for future investigations .",
    "the nlo corrections to the direct process become singular in the limit @xmath25 . for real photoproduction these photon initial state singularities",
    "are usually evaluated , i.e. regularized , with the dimensional regularization method in which they are finite for @xmath29 .",
    "the singular contributions appear as poles in @xmath30 multiplied by the splitting function @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "these initial state singularities are absorbed into the pdf of the real photon ( @xmath5 ) . with",
    "no further finite terms subtracted ( for @xmath32 ) this defines the @xmath27 factorization scheme which must be consistently applied also for the nlo evolution of the photon pdf .",
    "for @xmath14 the corresponding contributions appear as terms proportional to @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the c.m .",
    "energy of the photon - parton subprocess .",
    "these terms are finite as long as @xmath14 and can be calculated with @xmath35 dimensions . since for small @xmath2 these terms are large they are absorbed as in the case @xmath5 into the pdf of the virtual photon which is present in the resolved cross section . concerning finite terms ( for @xmath26 ) which may also be subtracted together with the singular terms we have the same freedom as in the case @xmath5 .",
    "we fix these finite terms such that they agree with the @xmath27 factorization in the real photon case . to achieve this",
    "we must compare the contributions originating from the photon initial state singularities in the two cases @xmath5 and @xmath14 , which we shall do in the following .",
    ".classification of @xmath36 matrix elements [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the procedure for virtual photons with virtuality @xmath2 is completely analogous .",
    "first one calculates the @xmath36 matrix elements , but now with @xmath14 and decomposes them into terms with the characteristic denominator from @xmath28 splitting which become singular in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "these terms after phase space integration up to a cut - off @xmath37 as in ( 1 ) have the same structure as ( 2)(5 ) with the lo parton - parton matrix elements factored out .",
    "the integration can be done with @xmath38 since @xmath14 . the phase space in ( 1 ) then contains the additional @xmath2-dependent factor @xmath39 @xmath40 which reduces to @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "the factor @xmath43 in the equations ( 2)(5 ) takes the simple form @xmath44 which is singular for @xmath5 as to be expected .",
    "this singularity is absorbed into the pdf of the virtual photon with virtuality @xmath2 . instead of ( 8)",
    "the subtraction term is : @xmath45 after this subtraction the remaining finite term ( for @xmath26 ) in @xmath43 yields @xmath46 in addition to the singular term @xmath47 we have subtracted in ( 12 ) two finite terms in order to achieve in ( 13 ) the same result as in ( 9 ) for @xmath5 .",
    "therefore we call this form of factorization the @xmath27 factorization for @xmath14 .",
    "it is defined by the requirement that the remaining finite term is equal to the finite term in ( 2)(5 ) with @xmath43 replaced by @xmath48 as was obtained in the calculation for real photons . with this definition of factorization in the case",
    "@xmath14 we make sure that we obtain the same nlo corrections as in @xcite , where @xmath42 , when in the @xmath14 calculation we choose @xmath2 extremely small .",
    "so , for the actual calculations we apply the formulas ( 2)(5 ) where @xmath43 is now given by ( 13 ) .",
    "we note that for averaging over the spin of initial gluons and photons we apply a factor @xmath49 , that gives rise to some additional finite terms which should be included in ( 9 ) when expanded in @xmath30 .",
    "we have taken these terms into account also in our calculation .",
    "this completes the calculation of the contribution from the photon initial state singularity .",
    "it is clear that in nlo the pdf for the virtual photon must be given also in the @xmath27 factorization scheme . in ref .",
    "@xcite the pdf is constructed in the so - called dis@xmath50 scheme , which is defined as for real photons ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this distribution function is related to the @xmath27 scheme pdf in the following way @xcite : @xmath51 where for @xmath52 or @xmath53 : @xmath54 \\\\      { \\delta}f_{g/{\\gamma}}(x , m_{\\gamma}^2 ) & = & 0 \\quad . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the pdf in this scheme is used to calculate the resolved cross section one must transform the nlo finite terms in the direct cross section .",
    "this produces a shift of @xmath55 as given in ( 13 ) by the same expression as ( 15 ) .",
    "then the relation is : @xmath56 \\quad .\\ ] ]    all other singular terms in the real corrections , i.e.  final state singularities and the contributions from parton initial state singularities have been calculated by graudenz in connection with the nlo corrections for jet production in deep inelastic ep scattering .",
    "they can be taken from his work @xcite together with the virtual corrections up to @xmath57 .",
    "( for related work see @xcite . )",
    "all these contributions are calculated in dimensional regularization .",
    "the appearing singularities in @xmath58 cancel when all singular terms are added .",
    "the remaining finite terms enter the nlo corrections for the jet cross sections .",
    "these finite terms depend on the phase space slicing parameter @xmath37 which is introduced to separate the singular regions of final and initial state infrared and collinear divergences .",
    "in this section , we present some characteristic numerical results for one- and two - jet cross sections as a function of the virtuality @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the contributions of the direct and resolved components and their sum .",
    "partly we shall compare the nlo results with lo predictions .",
    "the input for our calculation is the following .",
    "we have chosen the cteq3 m proton structure function @xcite which is a nlo parametrization with @xmath27 factorization and @xmath59 mev .",
    "this @xmath60 value is also used to calculate @xmath61 from the two - loop formula at the scale @xmath62 .",
    "the factorization scales are also @xmath63 .",
    "we also need the parton distribution of the virtual photon @xmath64 . for this",
    "we choose either the grs @xcite set or the sas1 m set of schuler and sjstrand @xcite .",
    "both sets are given in parametrized form for all scales @xmath65 so that they can be applied without repeating the computation of the evolution .",
    "unfortunately both sets are given only in lo , i.e. the boundary conditions for @xmath66 and the evolution equations are in lo . in @xcite pdf s for virtual photons have been constructed in lo and nlo .",
    "distinct differences occur for larger @xmath2 and @xmath67 which is mainly due to the different nlo perturbative boundary condition at @xmath66 , which does not exist for the real ( @xmath42 ) photon structure function .",
    "since neither of the two pdf s is constrained by empirical data from scattering on a virtual photon target we consider these lo distribution functions as sufficient for our exploratory studies on jet production and treat them as if they were obtained in nlo . in particular , we shall use the transformation formulae ( 14 ) for going from the dis@xmath50 to the @xmath27-scheme pdf , which makes sense only in nlo .",
    "then the parametrization @xcite is considered as the parametrization in the dis@xmath50 scheme . in the pdf of grs the input scale is @xmath68 gev and the restriction @xmath69 is implemented as to fulfill the condition @xmath70 .",
    "in addition the pdf of grs is constructed only for @xmath71 flavors .",
    "the production of the heavier @xmath72 and @xmath73 quarks is supposed to be added as predicted by perturbation theory of fixed order with no active @xmath72 and @xmath73 quarks in the proton and photon pdf s . in",
    "lo this amounts to adding the processes @xmath74 and @xmath75 to the cross section , keeping @xmath76 . since in this work",
    "we are primarily interested in studying the sum of the direct and resolved contributions and the influence of the consistent subtractions of the nlo direct part we refrain from adding the lo or nlo cross sections for direct heavy quark production as suggested in @xcite .",
    "so , our investigations in connection with the grs parametrization of the virtual photon pdf are for a model with three flavors only . for consistency",
    "we take also @xmath71 in the nlo corrections and in the two - loop formula for @xmath77 . to overcome this problem we studied the relevant cross sections also with the virtual photon pdf s of @xcite . here",
    "the @xmath72 quark is included as a massless flavor in the pdf which undergoes the usual evolution as the other massless quarks except for a shift of the starting scale @xmath12 .",
    "this @xmath78 pdf is considered only in the parametrization sas1 m with @xmath79 gev that is in the @xmath27 scheme .",
    "the cross sections we have computed are essentially for kinematical conditions as in the hera experiments .",
    "there , positrons of @xmath80 gev produce photons with virtuality @xmath2 which then collide with a proton of @xmath81 gev .",
    "the momentum transfer to the photon is @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "the energy spectrum of the virtual photons is approximated by @xmath84 with @xmath85 being the fraction of the electron energy transferred to the photon , when the virtuality @xmath86 .",
    "the momentum of the incoming proton is @xmath87 .",
    "the approximation for the virtual photon spectrum is used for the calculation of the resolved and the direct cross section . the expression ( [ ww ] ) factorizes in the cross section for @xmath88 with arbitrary final state @xmath89 if one neglects the longitudinal virtual photon terms . after integration over @xmath2 between @xmath90 with @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the electron mass",
    ", one obtains the weizscker - williams formula as used for calculations with untagged electrons as in @xcite , where @xmath4 dominates . the cross section for the process @xmath88",
    "is then given by the convolution @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the cross section for @xmath95 with transversely polarized photons of energy @xmath96 , if the transverse component of @xmath97 is neglected . to have the equivalent conditions as in the zeus analysis we choose @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "in the computation of the resolved cross section the approximation @xmath100 is inserted for the energy of the virtual photon , whereas for the direct photon cross section the exact relation for @xmath101 is taken into account through the kinematic relations .",
    "all further calculations proceed in the following way . for both , the direct and the resolved cross section",
    ", we have a set of two - body contributions and a set of three - body contributions .",
    "each set is completely finite , as all singularities have been canceled or absorbed into pdf s .",
    "each part depends separately on the phase space slicing parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the analytic calculations are valid only for very small @xmath37 , since terms @xmath102 have been neglected in the analytic integrations . for very small @xmath37 ,",
    "the two separate pieces have no physical meaning .",
    "in this case the @xmath103-terms force the two - body contributions to become negative , whereas the three - body cross sections are large and positive . in @xcite",
    "we have plotted such a cross sections for direct real photoproduction at @xmath104 .",
    "when the two - body and three - body contributions are superimposed to yield a suitable inclusive cross section , as for example the inclusive one- or two - jet cross section , the dependence on the cut - off @xmath37 will cancel .",
    "the separation of the two contributions with the slicing parameter @xmath37 is a purely technical device in order to distinguish the phase space regions , where the integrations are done analytically , from those , where they are done numerically .",
    "we have checked , by varying @xmath37 between @xmath105 and @xmath106 , that the superimposed two- and three - body contributions are independent of @xmath37 for the inclusive single- and dijet cross sections .",
    "first , we study the inclusive single - jet cross section . to calculate it we must choose a jet definition , which combines two nearly collinear partons .",
    "we adopt the jet definition of the snowmass meeting @xcite . according to this definition ,",
    "two partons @xmath107 and @xmath108 are recombined , if @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the rapidity and the azimuthal angle of the combined jet respectively , defined as @xmath112 and @xmath113 is chosen as in the experimental analysis .",
    "so , two partons are considered as two separate jets or as a single jet depending whether they lie outside or inside the cone with radius @xmath113 around the jet momentum . in nlo",
    ", the final state may consist of two or three jets .",
    "the three - jet sample contains all three - body contributions , which do not fulfill the cone condition .",
    "the cone constraint is evaluated in the hera laboratory system as for real photoproduction ( @xmath5 ) and in the experimental analysis .",
    "the calculation of the resolved cross section proceeds as for real photoproduction , i.e. the transverse momentum ( @xmath114 ) of the virtual photon is neglected so that the virtual photon momentum is in the direction of the incoming electron and @xmath100 .",
    "the cross section for direct photons , in which the initial state singularity is subtracted , as specified in the previous section , is given in the center - of - mass system @xmath115 and transformed into the hera laboratory system , again neglecting @xmath114 and other small terms proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "then the relation between the rapidity @xmath116 of the jet in the c.m .- system and laboratory system is as for real photoproduction , which is @xmath117 this @xmath22 and the corresponding azimuthal angle of the partons in the final state is also used for evaluating the jet definition given above .    in fig .",
    "1a , b , c , the results for @xmath118 are shown integrated over @xmath22 in the interval @xmath119 ( these boundaries are employed in the zeus analysis @xcite ) as a function of @xmath3 for the three values of @xmath120 and @xmath41 gev@xmath8 .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath2 has been chosen in such a way that it reproduces the @xmath121 results .",
    "inserting @xmath122 gev@xmath8 into the unintegrated weizscker - williams formula corresponds to the one integrated in the region @xmath123 gev@xmath8 .",
    "for all three @xmath2 the cross section is dominated by the resolved component at small @xmath3 . near @xmath124",
    "gev the direct component , which is the direct cross section without the subtraction term , denoted by dir@xmath125 , is of the same magnitude as the resolved cross section . as a function of @xmath2 the cross section",
    "@xmath118 decreases more or less uniformly in the considered @xmath3 range with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "one can see that this decrease is stronger for small @xmath3 as compared to large @xmath3 . in these and",
    "the following results the cone radius is @xmath126 . the corresponding rapidity distribution for a fixed @xmath3 will be shown later in fig .",
    "5a , b , c , d for the sas1 m photon pdf .    in fig .",
    "2a , b , c we studied the @xmath22 distribution of the dir@xmath125 contribution at fixed @xmath127 gev and the same @xmath2 values as in fig .  1 in comparison with two approximations , namely the lo cross section and the nlo cross section with @xmath14 only in the photon flux equation ( 17 ) and the rest of the cross section evaluated at @xmath42 as in @xcite .",
    "as to be expected this approximation is very good for @xmath122 gev@xmath8 .",
    "at the larger @xmath2 however it overestimates the cross section and should not be used .",
    "this means that the @xmath2 dependence of the direct part , although the strongest logarithmic @xmath2 dependence has been subtracted , should be taken into account .",
    "of course , in the sum of the resolved and the direct cross section the difference is small as long as the resolved part dominates which is true for the smaller @xmath3 s .",
    "the lo prediction , which is evaluated with the same structure functions and @xmath61 value as the nlo result , only the hard scattering cross section is calculated in lo , is smaller than the nlo result , the difference decreasing with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "of course , this finding depends on the chosen value of @xmath113 .",
    "the nlo cross section depends on @xmath113 , whereas the lo curve does not . therefore estimates of the inclusive cross section with lo calculations can be trusted only for large cone radii .",
    "it is clear that the resolved and the direct cross sections decrease with increasing @xmath2 for fixed @xmath22 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is of interest to know how the ratio of resolved and the direct cross section behaves as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "this is a well defined quantity in lo .",
    "the variation of this ratio with @xmath2 up to @xmath128 gev@xmath8 for @xmath127 gev and @xmath129 and @xmath130 is plotted in fig .",
    "3a , b , c , d. as we expected this ratio decreases most strongly for @xmath131 , since in the @xmath132 region the resolved component dominates whereas the direct cross section peaks for negative @xmath22 s ( see fig .",
    "2a , b , c ) .",
    "if we decrease @xmath22 towards the backward direction this ratio diminishes more or less uniformly for all @xmath2 . in nlo",
    "this ratio depends on the scheme chosen for the photon pdf . in the dis@xmath133 subtraction scheme terms in the photon pdf",
    "are shifted to the direct cross section as follows from ( 14)(16 ) in section 2 .",
    "this necessarily changes the ratio of the resolved to the direct cross section , not only in the absolute value but also in the dependence on @xmath2 . for all",
    "@xmath22 s this ratio is quite different from its lo value .",
    "the difference between the @xmath27 and dis@xmath50 scheme is small for @xmath134 moderate for @xmath135 and of the order of @xmath136 at @xmath137 .",
    "except at @xmath137 the ratio is always larger in the dis@xmath50 scheme than in the @xmath27 scheme .",
    "apart from the fact that the ratios plotted in fig .",
    "3a , b , c , d can not be measured directly , they are scheme dependent in nlo and have very large corrections when going from lo to nlo . in fig .",
    "3a , b , c we have also plotted the ratio for the case that the @xmath2 dependence is neglected in the cross section @xmath138 and taken into account only in the photon propagator ( denoted nlo(@xmath42 ) ) .",
    "this approximation gives a result very similar to the lo curve showing that the nlo corrections are more important for @xmath14 .",
    "of course at @xmath26 this approximation is equal to the nlo result in the @xmath27 scheme .",
    "the results shown so far are for a model with three flavors only and therefore should not be compared to the experimental data except when the contribution from the charm quark is added at least in lo .",
    "a more realistic approach is to use the photon pdf s sas1 m of ref .",
    "@xcite which are constructed for four flavors .",

    "the results for the sum of the resolved and direct contributions change between 10% and 30% in the small @xmath3 region and approximately 50% in the large @xmath3 region .",
    "as one can see the larger cross section for @xmath78 results primarily from the direct component . since the direct component is more important for large @xmath3 than for small @xmath3 the increase is stronger in the former region .    of interest",
    "are also the rapidity distributions for fixed @xmath3 .",
    "these are shown for @xmath127 gev as a function of @xmath22 between @xmath142 choosing @xmath143 and @xmath144 gev@xmath8 in fig .",

    "the direct component falls off with increasing @xmath22 quite strongly .",
    "this comes from the subtraction of the @xmath145 terms as is apparent when we compare with the unsubtracted direct cross section , labeled `` dir '' in fig.5a , b , c , d. the sum of the resolved and the direct ( subtracted ) cross section is more or less constant for the smaller @xmath2 values and decreases with increasing @xmath22 for @xmath146 and @xmath144 gev@xmath8 .    for large enough @xmath2",
    "we expect the unsubtracted direct cross section to be the correct one . in this region",
    "the subtraction term ( 12 ) must approximate the pdf of the photon rather well .",
    "we have checked this by a direct comparison . with increasing @xmath2",
    "the full direct cross section ( dir ) approaches the sum = res+dir@xmath125 better and better .",

    "this may be caused by our approximation of neglecting the transverse momentum @xmath114 of the virtual photon in the relation ( 22 ) and in the calculation of the resolved cross section .    in order to compare with preliminary data for the dijet cross section presented by the zeus collaboration @xcite we calculated the inclusive dijet cross section @xmath149 as a function of @xmath2 . here",

    "the calculational procedure is analogous to the inclusive single - jet cross section and follows closely the work presented in @xcite for @xmath42 . since inclusive two - jet cross sections depend on one more variable they constitute a much more stringent test of qcd predictions than inclusive one - jet cross sections .",
    "we could predict distributions in @xmath150 and @xmath151 for fixed @xmath3 or distributions in @xmath3 for various values of the two rapidities @xmath150 and @xmath151 in the same way as in @xcite for @xmath42 . since no such information is expected from the experiment in the near future we calculated only the @xmath3 distribution with the two rapidities integrated over the interval @xmath153 following the constraints in the zeus analysis @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath140 and @xmath141 gev@xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "6a , b , c , where the full curve is @xmath149 as a function of @xmath3 integrated over @xmath150 and @xmath151 in the specified interval and for @xmath154 . the functional dependence on @xmath3 does not change as a function of @xmath2 , only the absolute value of the cross section decreases with increasing @xmath2 .    in fig .",
    "6a , b , c we show also the cross sections for enriched direct and resolved @xmath155 samples .",
    "these cross sections are labeled `` dir '' ( dashed curve ) and `` res '' ( dotted curve ) , respectively .",
    "the two cross sections are defined with a cut on the variable @xmath156 where @xmath156 is defined by @xmath157 this variable measures the fraction of the proton energy that goes into the production of the two hardest jets .",
    "the `` dir '' curve gives the cross section for @xmath158 .",
    "this cut on @xmath156 leads to an enrichment of the direct component of the cross section , since exclusive two - jet events from the direct process have @xmath159 .",
    "the curve labeled `` res '' gives the cross section in the complementary region @xmath160 which characterizes the enriched resolved @xmath155 sample .",
    "the sum of the dir and res curves is equal to the full cross section @xmath149 with no cut on @xmath156 .",
    "it must be emphasized that both cross sections , whether @xmath161 or @xmath162 , contain contributions from the direct and resolved part .",
    "actually the resolved contribution in the enriched direct sample ( @xmath161 ) is non - negligible .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "6a , b , c are for the grs parton distributions in the @xmath27 scheme .",
    "as to be expected , with increasing @xmath2 the full cross section is more and more dominated by the dir component , in particular at the larger @xmath3 .",
    "this means that the cross section in @xmath160 decreases stronger with @xmath2 than in the @xmath158 region .",
    "this could be studied experimentally by measuring the ratio of the two cross sections as a function of @xmath2 for fixed @xmath3 .",
    "this has not been done yet . instead , the zeus collaboration @xcite measured the ratio @xmath163res@xmath164dir , where res and dir are the cross sections as defined above , but integrated over @xmath165 gev . with this integration cut on the transverse momenta of the two hardest jets ,",
    "the transverse momentum of the third jet may vanish which affords particular constraints on the remnant jets .",
    "this is treated as in @xcite .",
    "furthermore we replaced the grs photon pdf by the sas1 m photon pdf which is for @xmath78 flavors . with these assumptions we calculated the ratio @xmath166 as a function of @xmath2 up to @xmath167 gev@xmath8 and compared it with the zeus @xcite data in fig .  7 in lo",
    "( dotted curve ) and nlo ( full curve ) .",
    "the theoretical nlo curve agrees quite well with the data at @xmath168 gev@xmath8 but not with the measured point at @xmath169 gev@xmath8 and at @xmath170 gev@xmath8 corresponding to the photoproduction case .",
    "of course the ratio @xmath166 for @xmath4 is much more precise and lies 30 % higher than the predicted cross section .",
    "this disagreement at @xmath4 is to be expected since at this value of @xmath2 the measured inclusive dijet cross section for the enriched resolved @xmath155 sample is larger than the predicted cross section for a small @xmath3 cut @xcite . as in @xcite",
    "we attribute this difference between theory and experimental data to additional contributions due to multiple interactions with the proton remnant jet in the resolved cross section not accounted for by our nlo predictions .",
    "this underlying event contribution is reduced with increasing @xmath171 and/or smaller cone radii @xmath172 .",
    "as it seems , for larger @xmath2 , the underlying event contribution is also reduced . of course",
    "this could be studied more directly by measuring rapidity distributions for the enriched resolved @xmath173 sample as was done at @xmath4 in @xcite .",
    "we have calculated inclusive single jet and dijet cross sections for photoproduction with virtual photons .",
    "the direct and resolved contributions were calculated in next - to - leading order qcd using the phase - space slicing method .",
    "they were folded with the unintegrated weizscker - williams approximation and existing lo parametrizations for the virtual photon parton densities .",
    "the collinear singularity in the direct photon initial state was integrated analytically up to an invariant mass cut - off @xmath37 .",
    "contrary to real photons , this specific singularity is not regulated in the dimensional regularization scheme but by the mass of the virtual photon @xmath2 leading to a logarithmic dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "this logarithmic term is absorbed into the virtual photon structure function rendering the latter scheme and scale dependent .",
    "the remaining finite contribution is constructed in such a way that the corresponding real photon term is obtained in the limit @xmath42 in the @xmath1 scheme .",
    "similarly to the construction of virtual photon structure functions by grs and sas , our calculation of the hard scattering cross section then provides a consistent extension from @xmath42 to small , but non - zero @xmath2 .",
    "we presented @xmath37-cut independent results using the snowmass jet definition and hera conditions for distributions in the transverse energy and the rapidity of the observed jet and in the photon virtuality .",
    "for the case of very small @xmath2 , we found good numerical agreement with the predictions for real photoproduction . at @xmath147 gev@xmath8 ,",
    "the unsubtracted direct contribution corresponding to the case of deep inelastic scattering approximates the sum of the subtracted direct and resolved contributions quite well .",
    "a small discrepancy remains in the forward region , where the resolved contribution is dominant .",
    "as in the case of @xmath42 , the resolved component dominates at low @xmath3 and in the forward region .",
    "the nlo effects were demonstrated to be important in the ratio of resolved and direct cross sections as a function of @xmath2 . since the theoretical separation between direct and resolved is artificial , some scheme dependence remains here unless both contributions are defined by an experimental cut on @xmath174 in dijet cross sections .",
    "then the corresponding ratio shows significant nlo effects and good agreement with the available zeus data for @xmath175 gev@xmath8 .",
    "the disagreement below this value can be attributed to additional contributions coming from , e.g. , multiple scattering between the photon and proton remnants .",
    "future investigations on virtual photoproduction will require more data on single inclusive jet production as they exist for @xmath42 and at larger transverse energies .",
    "with luminosity permitting , a detailed dijet analysis of an infrared safe cross section such as @xmath176 , where the transverse energies of the two jets are not cut at exactly the same value , will provide a much improved insight into the structure of the virtual photon .",
    "furthermore , choosing a @xmath177-cluster - like jet definition with smaller cone radii will reduce both the uncertainties in the jet algorithm and in the underlying event . on the theoretical side ,",
    "one possible improvement is the correct treatment of the transverse momentum of the incoming photon for larger @xmath2 including a correct transformation from the photonic c.m .",
    "frame to the hera laboratory system . for a consistent nlo treatment ,",
    "the inclusion of nlo parton densities for the photon is necessary .",
    "these are , however , needed in a parametrized form and should also be studied in correlation with deep inelastic @xmath178 scattering data .                  for reviews see : a. vogt , proceedings of the workshop on two - photon physics at lep and hera , lund , may 1994 , eds .",
