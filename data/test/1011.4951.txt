    "@xcite studied star - formation processes in low - mass molecular cloud cores using one - dimensional ( 1d ) spherically symmetric hydrodynamic simulations . in his work , a transient , quasi - hydrostatic object is formed in the early phase of the proto - stellar collapse , a so - called first ( adiabatic ) core .",
    "the first core evolves via accretion from the natal core and it collapses again when it attains a temperature high enough to dissociate hydrogen molecules .",
    "although first cores are transient , they are essential to understand star formation processes because they assume a crucial role in the two major problems in the star formation process , the angular momentum and the magnetic flux problem .",
    "the first cores are interesting sites of diverse phenomena related to these problems such as driving molecular outflow @xcite , binary formation @xcite , planet formation @xcite , circumstellar disk formation @xcite , and so on .",
    "more than 40 years have passed since larson s theoretical prediction , but it has not been robustly confirmed yet by observations due to its observational difficulties .",
    "the lifetime of a first core is so short , on the order of 1001000 yrs , compared to the dynamical time - scale of its natal cloud , which can be about @xmath0 yrs depending on its initial density , that the detection probability of the first core is considered to be small .",
    "the first core is also deeply obscured in the infalling envelope with very large column density ; hence it is believed to be difficult to observe with current instruments . however , if we could observe first cores directly , they will significantly contribute to our understanding of star formation processes .",
    "the evolution of cloud cores with masses around @xmath1 has been well studied using three - dimensional ( 3d ) numerical simulations @xcite . in those cases ,",
    "the first cores evolve over very short dynamical time - scales because accretion from their natal cores controls the evolution .",
    "rotational support extends the lifetime of the first cores , but it is still brief compared to the dynamical time - scales of the clouds @xcite .",
    "however , we can expect that the first cores formed in very low - mass cloud cores do not evolve into the second collapse stage over these short dynamical time - scales because most of the gas in the envelope quickly falls into the first core and the accretion rate rapidly decreases .",
    "these first cores survive longer before the second collapse starts than do cores formed in more massive clouds . in the long - term evolution of these systems , radiation cooling plays an important role in disk stability and angular momentum transport @xcite .",
    "to handle the gas thermodynamics properly , radiation hydrodynamics ( rhd ) simulations are required .    very recently , several groups reported possible detection of first core candidates .",
    "@xcite found a very faint and compact core and claimed that it was a good first core candidate .",
    "their object must be very young , but it seems to be more evolved than a first core because it is associated with a well - collimated and high - velocity outflow , which is thought to be driven from a protostar after the second collapse .",
    "@xcite reported another candidates in the r corona australis cloud .",
    "@xcite found a good candidate for a first core whose spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is consistent with a theoretical model . a japanese group ( kawabe et al .",
    ", in preparation ) also reported a peculiar dense core which is a good first core candidate .",
    "these objects need to be confirmed by more precise observations , but these observations imply that first cores are more common than expected . the observed candidates commonly have faint seds and some of them seem to have small masses . considering observed core mass function ( cmf ) ,",
    "there are so many low - mass cores whose masses are less than @xmath1 @xcite . in the initial mass function ( imf ) , there are still many low - mass stars and brown dwarfs @xcite , although the relationship between the two mass functions is still unclear",
    ". therefore it seems reasonable and interesting to study the evolution of low - mass cores which have masses less than @xmath1 .",
    "the observational properties of first cores such as their seds were predicted on the basis of 1d rhd simulations @xcite and post - processing radiation transfer calculations by using the results of 3d hydrodynamic simulations with barotropic approximation @xcite .",
    "first cores have faint , low - temperature black - body - like seds in wide wavelengths from mid - infrared to centi - meter - length radio wave .",
    "first cores are faint but detectable with modern facilities such as the _ herschel _ space observatory , the submillimeter array ( sma ) , the expanded very large array and the atacama large millimetre / sub - millimetre array ( alma ) . with alma in full operation",
    ", it is expected that we will be able to resolve the structure of first cores such as spiral - arms formed via gravitational instability in the disk and driving region of the molecular outflow driven by magnetic fields predicted with magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new scenario for the evolution of first cores formed in very low - mass cloud cores .",
    "we prove that first cores in the very low mass molecular cloud cores have significantly long lifetimes .",
    "we also calculated seds and visibility amplitude distributions of our model , and compared them with the models of both a typical first core and a starless core .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe our method of rhd simulations and models used in the simulations .",
    "we show the results of the numerical simulations in section 3 and the observational properties of those simulated first cores in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "we perform 3d nested - grid self - gravitational rhd simulations .",
    "radiation transfer is treated with gray flux limited diffusion ( fld ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the details of our simulation code are described in our previous work @xcite , but we neglect magnetic fields in this work because initially we just intend to prove the concept .",
    "we use an idealized equation - of - state ( eos ) with adiabatic index @xmath2 which is different from that used in our previous work , @xmath3 , to make the calculations easier .",
    "we use the compiled tables of rosseland and planck mean opacities of @xcite and @xcite , as in our previous paper .",
    "the number of grid points in each level of the nested - grids is @xmath4 , and the finer grid is generated around the center of the computational domain to resolve the local jeans length with at least 16 grid cells to prevent artificial fragmentations @xcite .",
    "we calculated three models for comparison : _ s1 _ is a non - rotating @xmath1 model , _",
    "r1 _ is a rotating @xmath1 model , and _",
    "r01 _ is a rotating very low - mass model whose mass is @xmath5 . as the initial conditions",
    ", we take critical bonnor - ebert - like spheres with uniform rotation , and increase the density by a factor of 1.6 to make them unstable .",
    "the initial gas densities at the center and the radii of the clouds are @xmath6 in _ s1 _ and _ r1 _ , and @xmath7 in _ r01_. it is not trivial how we should scale the angular velocity between models with different masses , but here , we assume that both _ r1 _ and _ r01 _ initially have the same amount of rotational energy , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is a constant of order unity ) .",
    "the initial angular velocities are @xmath10 and @xmath11 in _ r1 _ and _ r01 _ , respectively .",
    "we adopt the boundary conditions that all the cells outside the sphere of the cloud radius maintain their initial values .",
    "the initial gas temperature and boundary conditions for radiation transfer are set to 10k . here",
    ", we note that our boundary conditions allow the gas to inflow into the computational domain through the boundaries , and at the end of the simulations about 30% of the initial mass increased in the low - mass case and less than 10% increased in the @xmath1 cases .",
    "we show the cross sections of the gas density and temperature of model _",
    "r1 _ and model _ r01 _ at the epoch when they have the same first core masses , @xmath12 , in figure  [ fig1 ] . here , the first core mass @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the volume of the cell and @xmath16 is the critical density defined as the minimum density in the gas that experienced the shock , which we identified as the region where the radial velocity is smaller than the local sonic speed , @xmath17 .",
    "the age of the first core at this epoch , @xmath18 , is 3,100 yrs in _",
    "r1 _ and 10,600 yrs in _",
    "r01 _ from the core - formation . model _",
    "r01 _ has a significantly larger ( @xmath19 au ) first core disk because it is more evolved and the gas with a larger specific angular momentum from the outer region has accreted onto the core .",
    "another outstanding difference between the models can be seen in the gas density and temperature in their envelopes . for the low mass core model , almost all the materials in the natal core",
    "have already accreted onto the first core , and therefore , the gas density in the envelope is reduced drastically .",
    "two factors cause the lower temperature in the envelope of _ r01 _",
    ": the smaller accretion rate in the very low - mass core results in the weaker shock at the surface of the first core , and thus , less entropy is produced at the shock ( in other words , the first core is intrinsically colder and fainter ) , and the smaller optical depth of the envelope contributes to the efficient radiation transport and cooling . in figure",
    "[ time ] , we show the time - evolution of physical quantities in each model such as central gas density ( a ) , temperature ( b ) , first core mass ( c ) and accretion rate onto the first core ( d ) .",
    "it is obvious that _ r01 _ has a smaller accretion rate and its mass increases more slowly than it does in other models . as a result , the gas density and temperature at the center of the first core evolve significantly slower .",
    "the lifetime of the first core , from its formation to the second collapse , reaches more than @xmath20 yrs in _",
    "r01_. both @xmath1 models achieved similar accretion rates because the initial structure of the cloud core determines the accretion rate @xcite , although the non - rotating model evolves faster than the rotating model .",
    "these results clearly indicate that centrifugal force supports a considerable mass and prevents the first core from collapsing .",
    "we note that the lifetime of the non - rotating model is longer than previous predictions @xcite , by about a factor of two , because we assume a simple stiff eos of @xmath2 , and our model has a smaller accretion rate due to stable initial conditions .",
    "but in the rotating models , the difference of eos affects the results less significantly because the centrifugal force dominates the structure of the first core disk .",
    "we show the thermal evolution tracks of the gas elements at the center of the clouds in the @xmath21 plane in figure  [ rhot ] .",
    "all the models show the effects of radiation cooling , but it appears most significantly in the low mass model .",
    "we also plot the evaporation temperatures of each dust component , which affect the thermal evolution of the gas .",
    "when the gas temperature reaches the evaporation temperature of iron and silicates , @xmath22 , the opacity drops substantially and the core collapses violently , similar to the second collapse due to the endothermic reaction of hydrogen molecule dissociation .",
    "however , if we adopt a soft eos with @xmath3 , the impact of dust evaporation becomes less important because the gas density ( and therefore the optical depth ) at the same temperature is higher .",
    "thus the effect of radiation cooling is important in the low mass core where dynamical accretion does not dominate the evolution .",
    "rhd simulations are required for these systems because the barotropic approximation fails to reproduce the realistic thermal evolution .",
    "our results show that the low - mass model has a longer lifetime compared to the dynamical time - scale of its natal core .",
    "this suggests that a large fraction of low - mass cores can harbor the first core when we carry out an unbiased survey of collapsing starless cores .",
    "although only a small fraction of the low - mass cloud cores may be gravitationally bound and will collapse into stars , there are a lot of low mass cores in star - forming regions , and we can , therefore , expect that a considerable number of elfs can form .",
    "we calculated the seds of first cores in the rhd simulations by performing post - processing radiation transfer .",
    "we solve the following radiation - transfer equation in one direction to draw an intensity distribution map for various inclination angles and wavelengths : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the planck function of temperature @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the monochromatic ( absorption ) opacity . here",
    ", we assume that the temperature @xmath25 obtained in the rhd simulations is correct , and we ignore scattering , which is a valid assumption in mid - infrared or longer wavelengths .",
    "we adopt the monochromatic dust opacities provided by @xcite , using the homogeneous aggregates model of normal abundances . in figure",
    "[ sed ] , we show the seds of our rhd models in the face - on configurations . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the sed of @xmath27 bonnor - ebert sphere , a model of a low mass starless core , and observed sed of l1521f - irs @xcite , which is a very low - luminosity object ( vello ) in the taurus molecular cloud .",
    "the distance towards the targets is set to @xmath28 and the seds are measured with a @xmath29 aperture . the flux in the far - infrared wavelengths increases when the first core forms and it can be observed with _",
    "herschel_. compared to l1521f - irs , model _",
    "r1 _ has similar brightness in submillimeter region but it disagrees in mid - infrared region .",
    "in contrast , model _",
    "r01 _ is fainter than l1521f - irs in all the wavelengths . in radio wavelengths , in spite of having a mass 10 times larger than that of _ r01 _ , _ r1 _",
    "is only about twice as bright as _",
    "r01_. however , the peak flux around the far - infrared wavelengths is significantly larger in _",
    "r1_. this is because it has a warmer first - core disk and envelope , as we mentioned before ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , _",
    "r01 _ is more luminous in the mid - infrared wavelengths because it has a thinner envelope .",
    "if we follow the more long - term evolution of the low mass cloud model , this tendency is enhanced .",
    "our models may explain the weak emission in mid - infrared wavelengths in some observed first core candidates @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the time - evolution of observational properties of first cores in a subsequent paper .",
    "first cores emit larger flux in the infrared region than starless cores , but it is still difficult to identify the existence of a first core only from the sed , because it is so faint in the infrared wavelengths and the differences in radio wavelengths between the first cores and the starless cores are not so prominent . another good method to distinguish first cores from starless cores is high resolution observation measuring visibility amplitude ( fourier components of the intensity map ) distributions with ( sub)millimeter interferometers .",
    "we show simulated visibility amplitude profiles of model _",
    "r01 _ measured in @xmath30 , obtained with the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) in figure  [ va ] .",
    "the visibility amplitude of the starless core decreases steeply in the small scale because it contains no fine structure .",
    "in contrast , the first core clearly shows a shallow distribution .",
    "this feature is not solely seen in the elf but common in first cores .",
    "this is firm evidence of the existence of the first cores .",
    "current observations with sma is not sufficient to resolve the first core directly , but sufficient to identify the first core .",
    "alma in full operation will reveal the detailed structure of the first core .",
    "we performed 3d rhd simulations of low - mass cloud cores and showed that first cores formed in very low mass ( @xmath27 ) cloud cores live more than @xmath20 yrs .",
    "those first cores have thin envelopes , therefore we name this first core an `` exposed long - lifetime first core ( elf ) . ''",
    "elfs experience different evolution from ordinary first cores whose evolution is dominated by accretion from the natal core .",
    "elfs use up the gas in the envelope in the early stages of its evolution , and then the mass and angular momentum redistribution in the disk control the evolution of elfs .",
    "radiation cooling plays a critical role there similar to the kelvin - helmholtz contraction , dominating the disk stability and angular momentum transport with the time - scale longer than the dynamical time - scale of accretion .",
    "thus , the evolution of elfs is different from that of the first cores formed in ordinary mass cloud cores , which have been well studied so far .",
    "the gas in elfs does not behave adiabatically anymore and the barotropic approximation breaks down .",
    "we also calculated the observational properties of elfs .",
    "we found that in radio wavelengths ( @xmath31 ) they have slightly fainter but quite similar seds to ordinary mass first cores .",
    "this fact suggests that elfs are detectable as well as ordinary first cores and they can be detected even with current instruments like sma . on the other hand ,",
    "elfs are more luminous in mid - infrared region because they have less massive envelopes than those of typical first cores .",
    "very low - mass cores will not collapse so often by self - gravity and the formation probability of elfs may be low .",
    "elfs are still worth considering because there are a number of low - mass cores both in observations @xcite and in theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "elfs are long - lived compared to the dynamical time - scale of their natal cloud cores , so observation possibilities are higher than for usual first cores .",
    "therefore , we can expect a considerable number of elfs exist in the star - forming regions .",
    "other mechanisms such as external pressure , cloud - cloud collision , radiation driven implosion @xcite , and dynamical ejection @xcite may help the formation of elfs .",
    "we will study the effects of magnetic fields and realistic eos in future works .",
