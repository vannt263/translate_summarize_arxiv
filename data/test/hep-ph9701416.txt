    "cosmic strings are effectively one - dimensional topological defects which may form at a phase transition in the early universe ( see ref . @xcite for a review ) .",
    "although much of the early interest in cosmic strings has centered on the possibility that they might have served as seeds for the formation of large - scale structure , cosmic strings are interesting physical objects in any case , and they have analogues in the study of condensed matter @xcite .",
    "any investigation of the evolution and cosmological consequences of cosmic strings must begin with the study of the initial cosmic string configuration , a study which was first undertaken by vachaspati and vilenkin @xcite , and re - examined by many others ( @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "although subsequent cosmic string evolution will erase many of the details of the initial configuration , one fundamental property of the initial conditions is crucial to the subsequent evolution : the existence of infinite strings . without the existence of infinite strings , the cosmic strings produced at the phase transition may all decay via gravitational radiation long before they can have any interesting cosmological effects .",
    "vachaspati and vilenkin found in their simulation that roughly 80% of the string was in the form of infinite strings @xcite . using a very different type of simulation for the string formation process , borrill @xcite claimed that this fraction was , in fact , zero , while robinson and yates @xcite , in a study of the dependence of this fraction on the power spectrum of the initial field , argued that for power spectra of the form @xmath0 , the infinite string fraction @xmath5 drops to zero for @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , this result is not obvious from their simulations ; it is based on fitting @xmath5 to an analytic function for @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the simulations of robinson and yates in two ways .",
    "first , we include the effects of long - wavelength modes which are absent from earlier simulations .",
    "second , we examine the effect of smoothing the initial field to remove lattice effects .",
    "we find that the former change has a dramatic effect on @xmath5 , sharply reducing @xmath5 for @xmath1 .",
    "smoothing also affects @xmath5 , leading to  lattice - free \" estimates of the fraction in infinite strings . in the next section we present our numerical results , and in section 3 we discuss briefly our main conclusions",
    "with one exception @xcite , simulations of cosmic string formation typically make use of a lattice . a value of the field @xmath8 associated with the string is assigned to each of the cells of the lattice , and the location of the cosmic string",
    "is then identified with edges of the lattice around which the field winds through 360@xmath9 .",
    "the original simulations of vachaspati and vilenkin @xcite were performed on a cubic lattice with no correlations between values of the field in different cells .",
    "subsequent researchers investigated changing the probability of string formation by  biasing \" the distribution of the values of the field @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , by allowing the field to be divided into domains of variable size @xcite , or by allowing long - range correlations between the field values @xcite .",
    "all simulations on a cubic lattice suffer from the problem that an ambiguity exists with regard to the string assignments at the vertices of the cubes ; this problem can be eliminated by going to more exotic lattices , such as the tetrakaidekahedral lattice , for which only four edges meet at every vertex @xcite,@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we simulate the formation of cosmic strings using a cubic lattice and a complex gaussian field @xmath8 with long - range correlations , where the strings are taken to lie along the zeros of @xmath8 .",
    "a gaussian field is completely characterized by its power spectrum , defined by @xmath10 we take @xmath8 to have a power - law power spectrum : @xmath11 models of this sort were first examined by vishniac , olive , and seckel @xcite , who proposed that cosmic strings with @xmath12 could be produced due to quantum fluctuations of the field @xmath8 during inflation .",
    "vishniac et al .",
    "showed that the mean string length per unit volume , @xmath13 is given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 note that some sort of smoothing or cutoff is required for convergence at large @xmath16 , but this is provided automatically by the lattice cut - off in numerical simulations .",
    "as @xmath17 , equation ( [ l / v ] ) gives @xmath18 ; this result is confirmed by our numerical simulations .",
    "physically , what happens is that within arbitrarily large regions of space the field @xmath8 has re(@xmath19 ( for example ) .",
    "an expression similar to equation ( [ l / v ] ) is also given in reference @xcite .    in our model ,",
    "we assign values of @xmath8 to the sites on a cubic periodic lattice , and the string is assumed to lie along the location of the zeros of this complex field .",
    "this model , as we have described it , is identical to that of reference @xcite , but we make two improvements in the model , both of which have to do with the limitations in dynamic range inherent in such a simulation .",
    "consider first the largest scales . because our simulation volume is finite , the simulation loses power on all scales larger than the box size , a problem which was noted by robinson and yates @xcite . in the simulations",
    ", this corresponds to the fact that the mean value of @xmath8 averaged over the entire box is zero .",
    "this problem can be resolved by adding a random uniform background field @xmath20 to every cell in the box ; this field represents the contribution to the field value from all fourier modes which are larger than the box size .",
    "the variance of @xmath20 can be determined from equation ( [ power ] ) , and in our simulations it is chosen to have a gaussian distribution with this variance .",
    "our second addition to the simulation involves the behavior of the field on small scales .",
    "the use of a lattice to simulate string formation is obviously unphysical , and numerical simulations clearly show that @xmath5 depends on the lattice being used .",
    "( compare , e.g. , the results of reference @xcite for a cubic lattice with those of @xcite and @xcite for a tetrakaidekahedral lattice . ) on the other hand , we do expect the field @xmath8 to be correlated on the smallest scales , leading to some sort of domain structure .",
    "we resolve this problem by smoothing the field on a scale larger than the cell size to eliminate lattice effects .",
    "our simulations were performed on a cubic lattice of size @xmath21 .",
    "a gaussian , complex - valued random field @xmath8 having the power - law power spectrum given in equation ( [ power ] ) was set down on the lattice .",
    "the strings were identified as vortices of the field @xmath8 . in tracing a closed path around the four cells bounding each edge of the lattice",
    ", the field was assumed to change values by moving in the shorter of the two possible directions in the complex plane .",
    "a cosmic string was then placed along an edge if the field traced out a 360@xmath9 circle in the complex plane as a path was traced around the four cells bounding that edge .",
    "we define an infinite string as one which crosses all the way from one end of the box to the other in at least one of the three directions .",
    "note that this definition differs from that used by robinson and yates @xcite , who used a cutoff in the string length .",
    "consider first the simplest case , for which we have no smoothing , and the mean field value is set to zero .",
    "this corresponds exactly to the simulations of reference @xcite . to find the value of @xmath5 and its variance",
    ", we performed 32 simulations for each value of @xmath22 , grouped into eight groups of four simulations . within each group",
    "of four , we derived an average value for @xmath5 by dividing the combined length of infinite strings in all four simulations by the total length of string in that group .",
    "this procedure corresponds to considering each of the four simulations in a group as sampling a different region of space .",
    "we then averaged @xmath5 for the eight groups of simulations to derive a final mean @xmath5 and variance .",
    "[ note that in deriving figures 3 - 6 , we used 4 groups of 4 simulations rather than 8 ] .    in figure 1a",
    ", we present our results for no smoothing with zero mean field .",
    "( all error bars are 1-@xmath23 ) .",
    "these results agree closely with those of reference @xcite , as they should .",
    "this indicates that @xmath5 is relatively insensitive to the exact definition of infinite string , since this is the only difference between our simulations and those of reference @xcite .",
    "now we repeat the simulations , but add a random uniform background field @xmath20 to the entire box .",
    "this background field has a gaussian distribution with a variance which can be determined , in principle , from equation ( [ power ] ) . in practice",
    ", we use a simpler method : we embed our simulation volume in a larger @xmath21 box with the same power spectrum , in which our entire simulation volume occupies a single cell of the larger box .",
    "the mean field @xmath20 in the simulation volume is then simply the value of @xmath8 in a single ( randomly - chosen ) cell of the larger box .",
    "note that this method still causes a loss of power at the largest scales ( i.e. , fourier modes with wavelengths longer than the size of the larger box ) , but it provides an effective dynamic range of @xmath24 , which represents a considerable improvement over the zero mean field case .    in figure 1b",
    ", we show our results for this case .",
    "the greatest difference between figures 1a and 1b occurs for @xmath6 : the addition of the background field produces a larger variance between runs , and it reduces @xmath5 sharply .",
    "the graph in figure 1b is consistent with the suggestion of reference @xcite that @xmath5 goes to zero when @xmath22 is less than some critical value @xmath25 , where @xmath26 ; i.e. , the average string density is still non - zero when the infinite strings disappear . in reference",
    "@xcite , it was claimed that @xmath27 , but this is inconsistent with our results .",
    "if we exclude points for which @xmath5 is more than 3-@xmath23 from zero , then we find @xmath28 .",
    "although our results are consistent with the possibility that @xmath29 , they do not rule out the possibility that @xmath4 ( i.e. , the infinite strings do not disappear until all the strings disappear ) .    in figure 2 , we plot the total length in closed loops and infinite strings as a function of @xmath22 with the inclusion of the background field .",
    "( all of the results presented in this paper , with the exception of figure 1a , include this background field ) .",
    "although the length in infinite strings is significantly reduced below that obtained without a background field ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , we can not tell with certainty at which value of @xmath22 the infinite strings disappear .    in figure 3 , we show the size distribution of closed loops for two representative cases ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) when the background field is included . in both cases , @xmath32 follows a power law in @xmath33 , but the slope changes noticeably with @xmath22 . fitting the points with @xmath34 , we find that @xmath35 these fits are shown as dashed lines in figure 3 .",
    "neither of these is consistent with the frequently assumed @xcite behavior @xmath36 , but even the original ( @xmath37 ) simulations of vachaspati and vilenkin @xcite found that @xmath38 .",
    "now consider the effect of smoothing the @xmath8 field on small scales .",
    "for a window function @xmath39 , the smoothed field @xmath40 is the convolution of @xmath41 with @xmath39 : @xmath42 the effect of smoothing is to reduce the magnitude of the small - scale fluctuations by averaging them out over the window function .",
    "we calculate @xmath5 when @xmath8 is smoothed with three different window functions , the spherical gaussian window function , @xmath43 the spherical tophat , @xmath44 and a sharp cut - off in @xmath16-space , which corresponds , in physical space , to the smoothing @xmath45 where we then normalize each window function to give @xmath46 .",
    "we now examine the variation of @xmath5 with @xmath47 .",
    "we consider only the case @xmath37 because it resembles the most likely scenario for string formation ( i.e. , no long - range correlations in the @xmath8 field ) , and for the range of @xmath22 values we have examined , it has the most short - range power and should therefore show the largest sensitivity to smoothing .",
    "our results are shown in figure 4a for the spherical gaussian , in figure 4b for the spherical tophat , and in figure 4c for the sharp cut - off in @xmath16-space .",
    "note that @xmath47 represents something different for each of our three window functions , so it is meaningless to compare @xmath5 for the same value of @xmath47 in each figure .",
    "however , the important point is whether there exists a range of values of @xmath47 for a given window function which produces a relatively constant set of values for @xmath5 . for the case of gaussian",
    "smoothing , @xmath5 decreases with @xmath47 but eventually  plateaus \" for @xmath48 , suggesting that the value of @xmath5 in this region is the  true \" value of @xmath5 for gaussian smoothing . averaging @xmath5 for @xmath49",
    ", we obtain @xmath50 .",
    "as @xmath47 is increased , the size of the smoothing volume grows compared to the size of the box , and we see larger fluctuations from one run to the next .",
    "however , the rms fluctuations in @xmath5 remain within @xmath51 of our mean value ( @xmath52 ) over the entire range of @xmath47 values we have examined ( @xmath53 . an average of @xmath54 over the range @xmath55 gives @xmath56 .    for spherical tophat smoothing , we again see that @xmath5 decreases with @xmath47 , but no obvious plateau is visible in figure 2b .",
    "in fact , tophat smoothing fails to eliminate lattice effects .",
    "if we substitute the smoothed version of the power spectrum into equation ( [ k2 ] ) , we find that for the spherical tophat window function with @xmath37 , the integral in the numerator in equation ( [ k2 ] ) fails to converge at @xmath57 , indicating that it is the cubic lattice , rather than the spherical tophat , which provides the cutoff in this case .",
    "this is confirmed by the loop distribution for the spherical cutoff ; unlike our other two window functions , the spherical tophat produces a loop distribution which retains a large number of loops with size of order the cell size .",
    "the sharp @xmath16-space cut - off shows qualitatively similar behavior to the gaussian window function .",
    "the value of @xmath5 decreases slightly as a function of @xmath47 , and reaches a plateau for @xmath58 . averaging @xmath5 for @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    ", we get @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .    in figure 5",
    ", we demonstrate the effect of smoothing on the size distribution of the loops , by showing @xmath32 for the closed loops with gaussian smoothing and @xmath63 .",
    "note that smoothing does not eliminate the closed loops smaller than the size of the window function ; rather , it reduces the number of loops to a constant as a function of @xmath33 for small @xmath33 .",
    "of course , the total length in closed loops is then dominated by loops with size near the point at which the power law behavior begins ( in this case , @xmath64 ) .",
    "smoothing allows us to test the analytic formula for the total string density given in equations ( [ l / v ] ) and ( [ k2 ] ) . for the power spectrum given by equation ( [ power ] ) smoothed with the gaussian window function given by equation ( [ gauss ] )",
    ", the expression for @xmath13 reduces to @xmath65 ( note that in this case , it is obvious that @xmath66 as @xmath17 ) . to compare with our simulations on the lattice ,",
    "@xmath13 must be multiplied by the number of cells ( 128@xmath67 in our case ) times the number of independent lattice edges per cell ( 3 for a cubic lattice ) .",
    "the expected string length derived in this way from equation ( [ analytic ] ) is compared to our simulation results in figure 6 , for a smoothing length @xmath63 .",
    "the agreement is excellent , within the expected statistical fluctuations . whether one views this as",
    "a confirmation of the analytic expression or of the validity of our numerical simulations is a matter of personal preference .",
    "our results are consistent with the possibility that a transition occurs in the string network at some value @xmath68 , with @xmath3 ; when @xmath69 the infinite strings disappear from the network , leaving only closed loops .",
    "robinson and yates @xcite argued that @xmath70 , but this value is not consistent with our results .",
    "furthermore , we can not rule out the possibility that @xmath4 , i.e. , the infinite strings do not disappear until the mean string density goes to zero .",
    "in fact , the following argument suggests that infinite strings should not disappear for @xmath71 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath8 are independent gaussian fields , and the zeros of each of these fields form a set of two - dimensional surfaces .",
    "consider first the surfaces defined by re@xmath72 . since the volumes of space occupied by the regions with positive and negative re(@xmath8 ) are equal , we expect both regions to percolate to an infinite distance .",
    "hence , the boundaries dividing these regions should contain at least some infinite surfaces .",
    "this argument holds for both the surfaces defined by re(@xmath73 and im(@xmath73 .",
    "the intersection of these two sets of surfaces gives us the location of the cosmic strings .",
    "since infinite surfaces must exist in both sets of surfaces , it appears that there must also be infinite cosmic strings .",
    "note that it is possible to imagine rather arcane distributions of the fields which violate this argument .",
    "for example , the regions with re@xmath74 and re@xmath75 could be nested inside of each other in larger and large finite volumes , producing a fractal distribution with arbitrarily large but finite surfaces of re@xmath72 .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that a gaussian field could lead to such a distribution . the crucial point in this argument",
    "is the fact that the distribution is symmetric with respect to positive and negative values of re(@xmath8 ) and im(@xmath8 ) ; if we relax this assumption and  bias \" the distribution , the argument no longer holds .",
    "in fact , infinite strings are observed to disappear in simulations with such a  bias \" @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the aim of our simulations with a smoothed field @xmath8 was to obtain a lattice - independent estimate of @xmath54 .",
    "we considered only the white noise spectrum , @xmath37 , and found @xmath76 for spherical gaussian smoothing and @xmath77 for a sharp cut - off in @xmath16-space .",
    "these values are comparable to those obtained in earlier lattice simulations without smoothing @xcite .",
    "the variation of @xmath54 for different choices of smoothing is not surprising , since , for example , the total string density @xmath13 in equations ( [ l / v ] ) and ( [ k2 ] ) clearly depends on the short - wavelength behavior of the spectrum @xmath78 ( which is affected by the smoothing ) .",
    "this variation is again comparable to the variation between the values of @xmath54 in simulations without smoothing on different types of lattice @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we find no evidence supporting the hypothesis @xcite that the presence of infinite strings is due entirely to the lattice and that they should disappear in lattice - free simulations .",
    "the smoothing length we used was sufficiently large to ensure that the loops making the largest contribution to the total string length had sizes much greater than the lattice cutoff , so that the lattice effects were minimal .",
    "still , we found a substantial fraction of the total length to be in infinite strings .",
    "we are currently investigating the formation of domain walls and monopoles with correlated fields . given that a parallel literature on this subject exists in condensed matter physics @xcite",
    ", these results may have applications beyond the purely cosmological .",
    "it is conceivable , for example , that the decline of the infinite string density with the decrease of the spectral index @xmath22 can be tested experimentally .",
    "what one needs is a condensed matter system ( such as liquid he@xmath79 ) in which linear defects are formed at a second - order phase transition .",
    "defect formation can then be observed by a rapid temperature ( or pressure ) quench from above to below the transition point @xcite .",
    "near the critical temperature @xmath80 , the order parameter develops long - range fluctuations . at @xmath81 ,",
    "the fluctuation spectrum is a power law of the form ( [ power ] ) with @xmath82 , where the critical exponent @xmath83 is typically a small number , @xmath84 @xcite ( @xmath85 for he@xmath79 ) .",
    "if the system is allowed to equilibrate very close to the critical point and is then rapidly quenched to subcritical temperatures , one can expect the length in infinite strings to be suppressed compared to a quench from a temperature well above @xmath80 ( where the fluctuation spectrum is close to @xmath30 ) .",
    "2 suggests a suppression roughly by an order of magnitude , while the value of @xmath70 conjectured by robertson and yates @xcite would give a much more dramatic suppression .",
    "it should be noted that a realistic quench is a rather complicated process , and its outcome can depend on a variety of physical effects ( for a recent discussion see @xcite ) .",
