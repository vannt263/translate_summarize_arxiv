    "however , the effective attractive form ( @xmath20 , favoring @xmath2-wave sc ) is also possible ( as well as an enhancement of the magnitude of @xmath21 ) and it can originate from the coupling of electrons with intersite ( intermolecular ) vibrations via modulation of the hopping integral or from the on - site hybridization term in the general periodic anderson model ( cf .",

    "<S> in this paper we determine the phase diagrams ( for @xmath0 as well as @xmath1 ) of the penson - kolb - hubbard model for two dimensional square lattice within hartree - fock mean - field theory focusing on investigation of superconducting phases and possibility of the occurrence of the phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that the phase separation , which is a state of coexistence of two different superconducting phases ( with @xmath2-wave and @xmath3-wave symmetries ) , occurs in define range of the electron concentration . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , increasing temperature can change the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter ( from @xmath3-wave into @xmath2-wave ) . </S>",
    "<S> the system considered exhibits also an interesting multicritical behaviour including bicritical points . </S>"
