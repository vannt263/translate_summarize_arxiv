    "one of the widely studied model to describe network dynamics , barab@xmath1si- albert ( ba ) , is based on preferential attachment mechanism @xcite . according to this model , over time",
    "new nodes join system and link to the earlier nodes , with probability proportional to the degree of preexisting nodes .",
    "nodes with higher degree have greater chance to attract more new connections .",
    "this leads to the emergence of hubs with very large degree .",
    "therefore , ba model characterizes one of the important features in real networks , namely , scale invariance @xcite .",
    "ba model has been very successful in describing many properties of real networks @xcite , however , its unlimited growth prediction for degree of nodes is not always in line with reality @xcite .",
    "in fact , in real networks other factors work against a node s growth which ba model fails to account for @xcite . for instance , in realistic networks like citation and scientific collaboration network @xcite , world - wide web network @xcite and network of movie actors collaboration @xcite , there are some important phenomena such as aging , screening and censorship to be included @xcite .    in network of movie actors for example , overtime ,",
    "hubs are replaced by new ones .",
    "superstars get promoted for some time period as they get to their height of popularity and eventually loose their attractiveness in eyes of media and decay gradually .",
    "new generation of stars will replace the old generation and repeat the same cycle again .",
    "an other example is political network @xcite , influence of people in politics grow and eventually decreases over time , political hubs are replaced by other people .",
    "no one experience unbound growth in politics .",
    "as opposed to many realistic situations where aging process causes the hubs to be replaced by newcomers , in ba model an emergent hub will always remain powerful and prevent newcomers from becoming strong hub .",
    "in other word , we need to consider the effect of losing power for old hubs and emergence of new hubs .",
    "number of studies have been done in this area and some strategies have been proposed @xcite . as a common issue with most of these approaches ,",
    "the outcome has been requested manually from the model , i.e , it is imposed on the network by adding some new terms to ba equation .",
    "the objection against these approaches is that , new terms that they added are not capable to demonstrate the main issue ; even more , it is not always possible to find a closed form solution .",
    "according to ba model nodes can connect to each other without any restriction , hence their degree can grow boundlessly .",
    "however , in many real systems , each node has limited capacity for joining other nodes .",
    "for example number of active friends a person can have is limited as a person would denote part of his / her time to each of those friends .",
    "since we have limited amount of time per day / weak , one can not simply have infinite friends .",
    "a scientist or actor has just enough time to collaborate with small number of partners .",
    "therefore , having some connections makes the space and opportunity scarce for more connections .",
    "it s current connections do not allow the node to join other nodes easily .",
    "this is similar to the phenomenon in fermi systems known as screening effect , reduction in effective electronic potential because of the cloud of electrons around one electron @xcite . to extend the preferential attachment mechanism",
    ", the model has to also pay attention to these kind of effects",

    "fractional calculus , the generalized form of ordinary differentiation and integration to non - integer order @xcite has unique features such as nonlocality and memory , making it highly applicable in many fields of science and engineering @xcite .",
    "with respect to the presence of kernel for history in fractional operators , the results from this model carries the system memory .",
    "in other word , memory of the system plays a substantial role in determining the future path .",
    "the proposed approach in this work to generalize ba model is based on fractional calculus . in this approach , the equation governing",
    "the dynamic of network growth is a non integer order differential equation .",
    "hence , operators from fractional calculus appear .    by working in fractional realm ,",
    "the time distances are no longer identical .",
    "in fact in the growth process , some nodes can face long time delays before jumping to the next time step .",
    "in other words , they become freezen in time . at the same time",
    "some other nodes experience very short waiting period and pass more time steps relative to the frozen ones .",
    "a simulated network based on fractional order ba differential equation approach has also been developed in which an old node looses effectiveness of its degree .",
    "therefore its attractiveness to absorb new links will decrease over time .",
    "figure ( [ fig : schem ] ) schematically represents dynamical growth of a network evolved based on preferential attachment mechanism .",
    "moreover , aging and screening effects have been considered .",
    "as a node gets older , its probability to attain more links from new members decreases .",
    "existing hubs will decay eventually and new hubs can emerge .",

    "in the ba model for network growth , the governing equation system , @xmath2 is an integer order equation for each node @xmath3 , does not include the past history of the considered node . only node s degree in previous step affects its present degree . in order to consider the history on the growth process",

    "this factor shows contribution of the previous degree of @xmath3th node on its present value . with increasing the lifetime ( increasing @xmath17 )",
    ", @xmath32 becomes smaller .",
    "in other words , over the time old links of a node will loose their effect on its growth process based on @xmath32 s coefficients .",
    "therefore , the effective degree of a node ( eq .",
    "( [ eq_num ] ) ) will decrease .",
    "for @xmath23 the @xmath32 converges to unity and we get back to the standard ba model in which old degrees all have the same weight . by numerically solving equation system ( [ disk ] )",
    ", we found interesting results confirming the effect of history on network evolution .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "( [ fig : num1 ] ) for various amounts of @xmath15 , show time dependence of @xmath35 ( effective degree has been left for @xmath3th node at time @xmath36 ) .",
    "it can be seen that for all values of @xmath37 , effective degree of node @xmath3 increases at first .",
    "it reaches the maximum value , then starts to decay .    this behavior could be as a result of competition between two mechanisms governing the network dynamic .",
    "on one hand , nodes absorb new links according to preferential attachment algorithm , on the other hands , aging process will reduce the probability of being selected by new members by reducing its effective degree at that moment .",
    "the older the member , the smaller is its portion from past history .",
    "however , on the same time period , node with higher degree would receive less impact from aging than node with smaller degree .",
    "many real world networks exhibit the above mentioned behavior . here as a well known example which will be studied in particular in section ( [ section4 ] ) , network of movie actors collaboration could be mentioned . in this network , we can see that superstars do collaborate with many actors as they become popular .",
    "however , because of screening effect one can just have the ability to cooperate with finite number of actors .",
    "there is not enough room for collaboration with every one .",
    "the rate of collaboration will reach a peak and then decline gradually over time as a result of aging process .    the growth and decaying rates depend on the order of fractional equation .",
    "smaller @xmath15 reaches the peak quickly but larger @xmath15 takes more time .",
    "the smaller the exponent is , the more aging can reduce growth rate . getting closer to exponent @xmath38 aging effect",

    "this time decreases exponentially with increasing the exponent . by considering even a very small effect of memory on evolution , which means any deviation from @xmath23",

    "because fractional order derivatives by applying a kernel over time involve the effect of elapsed time , it indicates the fact that every member has an end and will be isolated . in many real networks",
    ", members do not remain in the system for ever .",
    "as time passes , they will be set aside from the community .",
    "the results from fractional equation ( [ disk ] ) remarks this fact .",
    "along side solving fractional order dynamic equation governing the network , we have simulated a network with aging process . in this simulation",
    "we start by a fully connected network with @xmath39 members , hence each node has initial degree of @xmath40 . in each time",
    "step @xmath3 , node @xmath3 is introduced to the network , which is linked to @xmath40 previous nodes proportional to their degree .        to include aging process in the growth dynamic",
    ", the effectiveness of old links for a node is lessened .",
    "a link between two nodes , is less effective for old node , however it preserves its influence for younger one ; similar to a connection between two nodes in a directed weighted network . as a consequence",
    ", the probability of being selected by newly arrived members will be reduced for members with more old links .",
    "this reduced effectiveness of older links in growth dynamic has been applied by using @xmath41 coefficients which are proportional to link s life time as weight factors in calculating probability of receiving new links .",

    "the observed behavior is in good agrement with numerical results , ( fig .",
    "( [ fig : num1 ] ) ) , obtained from fractional order differential equation ( [ disk ] ) . just like numerical solution , initially , effective degree per time of a node increases , after reaching its maximum value it decays gradually .    in figure ( [ fig : image2 ] ) , we have shown some statistical proprieties of the network simulation with aging concept along side ba model .",
    "small @xmath15 represents severe aging effects , therefore behavior of quantities with smaller @xmath15 shows greater deviation from ba model .",
    "degree distribution reveals major characteristics of a model . for preferential attachment",
    "it follows a power law form @xcite , however in presence of aging it shows deviation from power law .",
    "this deviation from power law could be as a result of competition between aging process and preferential attachment mechanism . according to preferential attachment nodes with high degree",
    "absorb most of new links , however , getting older over the time reduces probability of high degree nodes to be selected @xcite , since aging reduces the effective degree of nodes .",
    "this reduces growth rate of older nodes which gives nodes with smaller degree a higher chance to receive new links .",
    "the average shortest path to all nodes in a network @xcite known as closeness centrality is a criteria to measure power of centrality for nodes in network .",
    "this quantity has been studied for different orders of fractional ba equation .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ plot_meana ] ) that closeness centrality for nodes has raised for aged system compared to ba model .",
    "this figure shows that older nodes in ba model have more central position in network respect to olders in aged system .",
    "moreover , in an aged system , older members are more close to others than younger nodes .",
    "aging process also has impacts on clustering coefficient of nodes , fig .",
    "( [ plot_clust ] ) .",
    "it is an indicator that displays tendency of a node s neighbors to connect to each other @xcite .",
    "senior members are associated with communities which have high degree of connectivity as opposed to recently added members .",
    "although aged nodes lose their importance , they still preserve their strategic position among others .",
    "however , in ba model older nodes have smaller clustering coefficient than olders in system by including aging effect .",
    "one significant consequence of considering aging is that new members can have the opportunity to grow and become a hub , as opposed to ba model where only early members have a chance of fast growth .",
    "hence tendency of nodes to connect to their similar nodes , what is called assortativity @xcite will increase .",
    "this can be seen in degree - degree correlation palette in figs .",
    "( [ plot_core_3]-[plot_core_10 ] ) . despite ba model that considerable connections are with hubs or older nodes , in aged networks remarkable correlation can be found between similar nodes in degree .",
    "in order to verify the above results for a real network , collaboration network of hollywood movie actors have been studied .",
    "we extracted list of actors from the internet movie database available at www.imdb.com .",
    "the table of all movies and star actors of those movies have been collected .",
    "tv series and tv movies are not included in our data .",
    "nodes in the intended network are actors and they have a common link if they have acted in the same movie . as a case study in this network , total number of collaboration of oscar winners with other actors per year has been derived as shown in figure ( [ plot_actors ] ) for some of them .",
    "it is the total number of staring actors that an actor / actress played with in each year .",
    "it can be seen that almost all the actors presented in the above network have the same pattern in their career . at start of acting career ,",
    "collaboration rate is increased till it reaches a maximum .",
    "after that , collaboration rate will decrease gradually . despite some exceptions , it is a general behavior that collaboration rate will decrease ultimately .",
    "the average collaboration rate of @xmath42 actors and @xmath43 actresses show the mentioned pattern in the network , fig .",
    "( [ plot_ave_actors ] ) .",
    "although the general behavior is similar for both curves , the mean value for number of collaboration for actresses reaches the maximum sooner .",
    "it behaves as if its dynamic equation has smaller order of differentiation , @xmath15 , than the curve for actors collaboration . in other words , history effects and aging process",
    "have more severe impacts on actresses growth .",
    "besides , studying the mean rate of collaboration on first and second half of the whole period shows no noticeable difference in dynamical behavior .",

    "complexity and collective behavior are key characteristics of many natural and social systems .",
    "the past of a realistic systems can not be ignored in its dynamics and what is happening now .",
    "even it could be said , since future expectations of a system are reselections of system goals , a complex system dynamic can be characterized by its goals too .",
    "some mathematical models have been proposed to expand ba model by adding new terms to it s differential equation , however , since these additional terms are not unique , there is no clear method to prefer one over the other .",
    "more over often these additional terms do not often have analytical solution .    in attempt to describe how the history play role in the current events and growth dynamic of networks",
    ", we apply a kernel function as a average of the history on the standard equation in ba model .",
    "this choice for the kernel shows interwoven of past events that leads to dynamic of the system .",
    "this approach leads to a fractional order ba differential equation governing network dynamic .",
    "according to results , this approach predicts a boundary for growth of members .",
    "just by generalizing governing equation in ba model to an equation with fractional order derivative , a more realistic dynamic for systems is achieved .",
    "as it can be seen in many real systems such as movie actors collaboration , networks of scientific papers , friendship networks and etc , degree of nodes progress for a certain period of time and then decay gradually after that .",
    "this change in topology of the system causes redistribution in the members power .",
    "moreover , even future goals of a system be it minimizing system energy or adaptability with nature ( in evolution ) could shape its dynamic too .",
    "future projection of kernel could be tough of as the way that future goal might effect one s present decisions .",
