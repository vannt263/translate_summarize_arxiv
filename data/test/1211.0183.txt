    "the intuitive meaning of _ heat _ and _ work _ in thermodynamics is that of two types of energetic resources , one fully controllable and useful , the other uncontrolled and wasteful . an impressive effort has been devoted to provide a consistent mathematical characterisation of these notions within a quantum mechanical description of physics @xcite",
    "this is a challenge since in contrast to other thermodynamic quantities , such as internal energy and entropy , heat and work are not properties of individual states of a system .",
    "they are defined for _ continuous processes _ connecting different states  @xcite , implying that their statistical fluctuations can not be described in terms of a single system observable .",
    "two - point correlation functions characterising the correlations along process paths are required - a problematic territory for quantum mechanics where definite trajectories can not be fixed unless the system is continuously measured . resolving these issues",
    "has been the topic of a number of publications that have formulated quantum trajectory approaches @xcite .",
    "in contrast here we focus on the _ mean _ values of heat and work where the analysis simplifies but still requires careful thought .",
    "we will adopt the identification of the system s internal energy with @xmath0 $ ] where @xmath1 is the density matrix describing the state of the system at given time , and @xmath2 is its instantaneous hamiltonian .",
    "clearly , a proper definition of this hamiltonian is in general problematic !",
    "if the system is coupled to an environment the non - equilibrium behaviour of a general open system makes the definition of the system s hamiltonian ambiguous @xcite both , mathematically and experimentally",
    ". ultimately the choice of the hamiltonian one assigns to the system must rely on the set of operations and observables one can access experimentally . in many situations of physical interest @xmath2",
    "can be identified with the bare system hamiltonian or an effective system hamiltonian that incorporates the effect of the environment .",
    "while the environment degrees are in principle uncontrolled , full control can be exerted over the temporal  variation \" of the system hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , the size of a container in which steam is pumped can be freely chosen and a piston can be attached to the container that can push the wheels of a train . a formal definition of mean heat and work is then obtained by considering an infinitesimal change of the internal energy @xmath3 =   { { \\rm tr}}[\\rho \\ , { d}h ] + { { \\rm tr } } [ { d}\\rho \\ , h]\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] associated with the time evolution of the system which brings its density matrix from @xmath1 to @xmath4 while the hamiltonian varies from @xmath2 to @xmath5 . the origin for the change of @xmath1 may here be due to both , the variation of @xmath2 induced by the experimenter and by the dynamics due to the coupling with the environment .",
    "the possibility of externally controlling @xmath2 suggests to identify the first term on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ firsteq ] ) with the average work done by the experimenter during the evolution .",
    "the second term describes the internal energy change due to a reconfiguration of the system , i.e. a variation of the system s density matrix .",
    "this is an energy contribution over which the experimenter has no direct control and this is why it is associated with heat .",
    "the infinitesimal average _ heat absorbed by the system _ and the infinitesimal average _ work done on the system _ @xcite are therefore defined as @xmath6 \\quad \\mbox{and } \\quad { { \\delta}}w : = { { \\rm tr } } [ \\rho \\ ,   { d}h]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the symbol @xmath7 indicating that heat and work are in general no full differentials , i.e. they do not correspond to observables .    while the first law of thermodynamics states that the sum of the two average energy types is the average internal energy , @xmath8 the _ split _ into these two types of energies is crucial as it allows the formulation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "a fundamental law of physics , it sets limits on the work extraction of heat engines and establishes the notion of _ irreversibility _ in physics .",
    "the second law can be phrased in form of clausius inequality : @xmath9 stating that the change in a system s entropy must be larger than the average heat absorbed by the system during a process .",
    "while the first law of thermodynamics is fundamental for any process , the second law was originally stated for processes that _ start and end in equilibrium_. recently , the non - equilibrium work relation due to jarzynski has been used to argue that the second law should also hold for any process starting from equilibrium , at temperature @xmath10 , but ending in an arbitrary non - equilibrium state @xcite . however",
    ", no conclusive argument has yet established the most general set of dynamical processes that obey the clausius inequality @xcite .    extending the infinitesimal scenario to _ finite , continuous processes _ in which the temporal evolution of @xmath11 and @xmath12 in time @xmath13 is known , the mean heat and work can be found by integrating over the trajectory taken from @xmath14 and @xmath15 to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : q } \\\\",

    "there are two paradigmatic examples of _ all work _ and _ all heat _ processes that we introduce here and which will become important in the later part of the manuscript .",
    "the first process is a unitary process , which we will also refer to as _ closed _",

    "w_{unitary } & = & \\delta u\\ ; , \\label{example1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consistent with the physical intuition that _ no _ heat has been provided to the system during the evolution .",
    "the second example is a system that evolves through the action of a dissipative , i.e. _ open _ , markov process via a master equation  @xcite , @xmath22 + { \\cal l}(\\rho(t))\\ ; , \\label{ddf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 being the dissipative lindblad term . under the assumption that the typical time scales associated with the time - independent @xmath2 are much shorter than those associated with @xmath23 we can treat the system as almost isolated and use eq.([firsteq ] ) to compute its internal energy . in this limit eq .",
    "( [ eq : q+w ] ) is valid with the hamiltonian just being the time - independent @xmath2 , @xmath24 - { { \\rm tr}}[\\rho(0 ) \\ , h ] = \\delta u , \\,\\ , \\label{identity111}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is in full agreement with the physical intuition that no work has been performed on the system .",
    "while these examples constitute special cases of continuous processes the heat and work in a general process depend intimately on the exact details of the process .",
    "however , the caveat with this viewpoint is that in most real life applications one does _ not _ know what the dynamics of the state of the system is nor what the appropriate local hamiltonian is at all times .",
    "importantly , this is not just due to our ignorance of what happens at the quantum level .",
    "quantum physics has strong fundamental limitations on what we _ can know _ without choosing a measurement apparatus , measuring the system and interpreting the data .",
    "moreover , if the system is indeed measured then the experimenter s choice of what degrees of freedom she actually measures will effect what the _ measured _ heat and work will be .",
    "in other words , we propose that there is no _",
    "one _ average heat and work for a particular process , there are different sensible outcomes to this question and the answer depends on the choice of system hamiltonians in time , @xmath12 , that corresponds to specific measurement choices .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that it is possible to formulate a general second law independently of these choices . to achieve this",
    "we will depart entirely from the traditional continuous trajectory approach and propose a rather drastic but pragmatic change of perspective .",
    "we develop a consistent framework of mean heat and work for _ discrete thermodynamic processes_. the rationale for this approach is that while the true process is continuous , observations we make on the system are almost always discrete .",
    "( we will neglect here the possibility of monitoring through continuous weak measurements . ) for discrete snapshots of the dynamics , we find that by decomposing the transition into possible sequences of two fundamental primitives , it is possible to define heat and work for the discrete process in a way that is experimentally and mathematically clear .",
    "this allows us to establish a general second law for discrete processes between equilibrium and non - equilibrium states and the analysis of a discrete carnot cycle , where we uncover the usual carnot efficiency .",

    "clausius inequality establishes the existence of an upper bound to the heat received by the system .",
    "clearly , clausius s goal was to characterise different forms of _ energy _ and their interconversion . however , by formulating the second law of thermodynamics he defined a new quantity : entropy .",
