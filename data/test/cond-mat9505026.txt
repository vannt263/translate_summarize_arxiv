    "since the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect@xcite , the properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) interacting electron systems in a strong magnetic field have attracted persistent attention . historically , almost all the efforts were directed toward the study of the strong magnetic field case when only the lowest landau level is occupied .",
    "some attempts were undertaken @xcite to extend the analysis to a larger filling factor @xmath5 .",
    "however , they were all limited to the case when the energy of the electron - electron interaction is much smaller than the inter - landau level spacing , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 being the magnetic length and the background dielectric constant respectively . under this condition",
    ", one can describe the system in terms of one landau level only ; the effect of mixing of the other landau levels was either neglected or taken into account by perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "in a weak magnetic field , the typical coulomb energy exceeds the cyclotron energy @xmath2 . in this case , one can start from the fermi liquid theory in zero magnetic field .",
    "the concept of fermi liquid usually enables one to neglect the interactions between quasiparticles when determining their energy spectrum in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "this concept is based , first , on the screening of coulomb interaction , and , second , on the constraint on the phase space allowed for a scattering event@xcite .",
    "landau quantization of the non - interacting quasiparticles in two dimensions creates a system of discrete levels .",
    "the existence of energy gaps between the levels affects adversely the screening , which involves the low - energy excitations of the electron system .",
    "in addition , if the fermi level coincides with a landau level , the system of non - interacting quasiparticles becomes infinitely degenerate , and even a weak interaction lifts this degeneracy .",
    "this may result in a non - trivial fine structure of the partially filled landau level ( pfll ) .    in this paper , we study the low - energy properties of the system with a partially filled high landau level@xcite ( the level index @xmath9 equals to the integer part of @xmath10 $ ] ) . by integrating out all the other degrees of freedom , we derive the effective interaction between the electrons occupying this level .",
    "this procedure is valid for a weakly interacting electron gas @xmath11 , and at sufficiently large filling factors , @xmath12 .",
    "( here @xmath13 is the conventional parameter characterizing the interaction strength . )",
    "the effective hamiltonian enables us to develop a microscopic theory of the thermodynamic and tunnelling densities of states , and a description of spin excitations . in the tunnelling density of states",
    ", we find a pseudo - gap with a characteristic width @xmath14 , which confirms the result of the hydrodynamic approach@xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic density of states and spin excitations are characterized by the energy scale @xmath15 .",
    "both energies are smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "it makes our theory complementary to the conventional fermi liquid picture@xcite which is valid in the energy range @xmath16 .",

    "let us first consider an incompressible electron liquid with an integer filling factor @xmath17 . because of the gap @xmath2 in the spectrum , an external in - plane electric field @xmath18 can not be screened by the 2d electron system .",
    "instead , it causes only a finite polarization per unit area , @xmath19 .",
    "the polarizability of the incompressible 2d electron liquid reduces the interaction @xmath20 between two point charges embedded into it , @xmath21 where the two - dimensional dielectric function @xmath22 is related to the polarizability @xmath23 by@xcite @xmath24    at small wave vectors , the matrix elements of the dipolar moment between adjacent landau levels , @xmath25 , give the main contribution to the polarizability , @xmath26 ; here @xmath27 is the electron density on a landau level . the characteristic spreading of the electron wave function on a high landau level is equal to the cyclotron radius @xmath28 , and",

    "therefore , unlike the bare coulomb potential , the renormalized interaction does not mix landau levels .",
    "this observation enables us to construct an effective theory of the low energy properties of the electron system .",
    "similar to the strong magnetic field case , @xmath44 , the corresponding hamiltonian is just the energy of interaction between the electrons restricted to a single , partially filled landau level .",
    "the main difference is that in our case the interaction potential ( [ potentialq ] ) is much smaller than bare coulomb potential , and the pfll has a high index @xmath9 .",
    "although still unsolvable , this low - energy theory is much simpler than the original one , where all the landau levels were relevant .",
    "armed with the effective theory , we are able to estimate the characteristic energy scales which control the low - energy dynamics . in order to make these estimates",
    ", we employ the hartree - fock trial function , based on the one - electron wave functions of the @xmath45-th landau level .",

    "[ sec : td ] and [ sd ] for more details . ) at small electron concentration on the pfll , @xmath46 , the separation between electrons on this level exceeds the size of the wave function , @xmath47 . in this case",
    "the system under consideration is equivalent to a classical crystal of point charges interacting via potential ( [ potentialq ] ) . in the extremely dilute limit , @xmath48",
    ", the polarization is not important , and the usual coulomb repulsion between the electrons of the pfll is not modified . in this limit",
    "the electron system of the pfll does not differ from a wigner crystal of electrons of the lowest landau level in the strong magnetic field regime .",
    "however , due to the polarization effect , there is a wide region of electron densities in the weak field regime , @xmath49 , where the coulomb repulsion in the crystal is replaced by the logarithmic potential ( [ potlong ] ) . in this case , the static properties of the electron crystal are equivalent to those of the vortex lattice in a thin superconducting film@xcite .",
    "we apply the developed picture to study of the energy dependence of the tunnelling density of states .",
    "we find a suppression of the tunnelling density of states ( one - electron spectral density ) at energies close to the fermi level @xmath50 , which is similar to the known results@xcite for a small filling factor , @xmath51 . in the latter case , despite rather different approaches , all the authors@xcite find a `` gap '' region of width @xmath52 ( here @xmath53 is the total electron density at @xmath54 ) .",
    "such a gap can be easily understood : @xmath55 equals the coulomb interaction energy of an extra electron with a `` frozen '' 2d electron system .",
    "if there were no relaxation of the system at all , the density of states would vanish at energies @xmath56 .",
    "the relaxation processes smear out the threshold in the density of states ; however , the suppression is still strong at these energies , because the characteristic relaxation time exceeds @xmath57 in a strong magnetic field . for a weak magnetic field ,",
    "there are two stages in the evolution of the system after an electron tunnelled in . on the short time scale , @xmath58 , the polarization of the medium",
    "is formed , and the potential induced by the additional electron acquires the form ( [ potentialq ] ) . at larger time scales ,",
    "only the electrons of the pfll can be re - distributed .",
    "the latter processes are slow , which causes the suppression of the tunnelling density of states .",
    "the corresponding gap is determined by the interaction of the tunneled electron with its nearest neighbors , @xmath59 .",
    "for a broad range of the filling factors of the pfll , @xmath60 , the width of the gap is : @xmath61 it is worth noticing that @xmath55 depends on the interaction strength and on the electron density on the pfll only logarithmically .    at larger concentrations , @xmath62 ,",
    "the single electron wave functions are still orthogonal to each other , but the densities corresponding to these wave functions have a significant spatial overlap . because of the strong repulsion between electrons at short distances , one could naively expect that the interaction on these distances gives the main contribution to the energy of the many - electron state .",
    "however , for the fully spin polarized electron system of the pfll , the orbital part of the many - electron wave function is antisymmetric , and vanishes whenever two electrons have the same coordinates .",
    "this suppression of the wave function amplitude compensates the large value of the interaction potential at @xmath63 . at larger distances , @xmath64 , the interaction ( [ potshort ] )",
    "decays rapidly , and the corresponding contribution to the hartree - fock energy turns out to be smaller than the contribution of the long - range interaction ( [ potlong ] ) , see secs .  [ sec : td ] and [ sd ] .",
    "this results in the saturation of the logarithmic growth of the gap @xmath55 with the electron density : at @xmath62 the gap in the tunnelling density of states is @xmath65 this estimate was obtained previously in the framework of the hydrodynamic approach@xcite .",
    "we turn now to the discussion of the spin - flip excitations .",
    "the orbital part of the many - electron wave function of such an excited state is no longer antisymmetric .",
    "therefore , the energy of such an excitation , @xmath66 , is determined not only by the bare zeeman energy but also by the extra interaction energy associated with the change in the structure of the orbital wave function . because the orbital part of the wave function is not antisymmetric , the interaction on a short range ( @xmath67 ) now does contribute to the energy of the state .",
    "this corresponds to the well known exchange enhancement of the @xmath68-factor@xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "we analyze the exactly solvable case of a pfll which has a completely filled spin - polarized sublevel . flipping the spin of a single electron",
    "affects the exchange interaction of this electron with all the other electrons of the _ same _ landau level .",
    "all the lower landau levels carry equal number of electrons of both spin polarizations , and do not contribute to the energy associated with the spin flip .",
    "therefore , only @xmath69-th fraction of the total electron density participates in the exchange enhancement , and the corresponding contribution to @xmath66 is approximately @xmath45 times smaller than the exchange energy per electron at zero magnetic field . for a 2d electron gas with fermi wave vector @xmath70 ,",
    "the latter energy is of the order @xmath71 , and the contribution to @xmath66 is of the order @xmath72 .",
    "the rigorous result obtained in sec .  [ sw ] differs from this estimate only by a logarithmic factor . for the effective @xmath68-factor defined by the relation",
    "@xmath73 we obtain @xmath74 if the filling factor @xmath75 is odd . here",
    "@xmath76 is determined by the zeeman splitting in the absence of the interaction , and it is usually small ( in @xmath77 the value of @xmath76 is only @xmath78 ) . for the even filling factors , the value of @xmath66 is determined solely by @xmath76@xcite .",
    "we see that in the weak magnetic field , the energy scale of charge excitations @xmath79 is parametrically smaller than the energy scale for spin excitations @xmath15 .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the situation at low filling factor , @xmath51 , where both these excitations are characterized by the same energy scale @xmath80 .",
