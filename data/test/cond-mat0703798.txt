    "nanotechnology , as well as biology , biophysics and chemistry are using or studying setups and objects which are smaller and smaller . in these systems , one is usually interested in mean values , but thermal fluctuations play an important role because their amplitude are often comparable to the mean values .",
    "this is for example the case for quantities such as the energy injected in the system or the energy dissipated by the system .",
    "these fluctuations can lead to unexpected and undesired effects : for instance , the instantenous energy transfer can be reversed by a large fluctuation , leading energy to flow from a cold source to a hot one .",
    "these events , although rare , are quantitatively studied by the recent fluctuations theorems ( fts ) .",
    "these theorems give fluctuation relations ( frs ) that quantify the probability of these rare events in systems which can be arbitrarily far from equilibrium .",
    "fts have been demonstrated in both deterministic systems  @xcite and stochastic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "experiments searching for frs have been performed in dynamical systems  @xcite , but interpretations are very difficult because a quantitative comparison with theoretical prediction is impossible .",
    "other experiments have been performed in stochastic systems described by a first order langevin equation : a brownian particle in a moving optical trap  @xcite and an out - of - equilibrium electrical circuit  @xcite in which existing theoretical predictions  @xcite were verified .",
    "interesting comments on the langevin equation can be found in @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we study a thermostated harmonic oscillator described by a second order langevin equation .",
    "we experimentally search frs for the work done by an external operator and for the heat dissipated by the system , and present analytical derivations of fts based on experimental observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : system : description ] , we present the experimental system , write its energy balance to define the work given to the system together with the heat dissipated .",
    "we then introduce the fluctuation relations ( frs ) and the fluctuation theorems ( fts ) . in sections",
    "[ sec : tftexp ] , [ sec : ssftrampexp ] and [ sec : sinusexp ] , we present experimental results on the fluctuations of first the work and then the heat . a short discussion on experimental results in given in [ sec : expconc ] .",
    "then , in sections [ sec : worktheo ] and [ sec : heattheo ] , we present some analytical derivations of fts based on hypothesis inspired by experimental observations .",

    "our system is a harmonic oscillator and we measure the non - equilibrium fluctuations of its position degree of freedom .",
    "the oscillator is damped due to the viscosity of a surrounding fluid that acts as a thermal bath at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "our oscillator , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pendulum]a , is a torsion pendulum composed of a brass wire ( length @xmath1  @xmath2 , width @xmath3  @xmath2 , thickness @xmath4  @xmath5 ) and a glass mirror glued in the middle of this wire ( length @xmath6  @xmath2 , width @xmath7  @xmath2 , thickness @xmath8  @xmath2 ) .",

    "the angular displacement of the pendulum @xmath18 is measured by a differential interferometer  @xcite .",
    "the measurement noise is two orders of magnitude smaller than thermal fluctuations of the pendulum .",
    "@xmath19 is acquired with a resolution of @xmath20 bits at a sampling rate of @xmath21  @xmath13 , which is about 40 times @xmath22 .",
    "we drive the system out - of - equilibrium by forcing it with an external torque @xmath23 by means of a small electric current @xmath24 flowing in a coil glued behind the mirror ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pendulum]b ) .",
    "the coil is inside a static magnetic field .",
    "the displacements of the coil and therefore the angular displacements of the mirror are much smaller than the spatial scale of inhomogeneity of the magnetic field .",

    "the angular displacement @xmath18 of this harmonic oscillator is very well described by a second order langevin equation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the thermal noise , delta - correlated in time of variance @xmath8 and @xmath29 the boltzmann constant and @xmath0 the temperature of the system which is the one of the surrounding fluid .",
