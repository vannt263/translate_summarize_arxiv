    "the electronic fate of a carbon nanotube ( cn ) is in general determined once it has been grown .",
    "depending on the radius and the chiral angle it can be semiconducting or metallic .",
    "the electronic properties of cn can however be modulated by coaxial magnetic field via the bohm - aharonov ( ba ) effect which can turn a metallic cn into a semiconducting one and vice versa .",
    "this has been predicted by ajiki and ando @xcite and observed recently in three independent measurements @xcite .",
    "cn have an ideal structure for studying the effect of the ba flux on the energy spectrum . a magnetic field * b * introduces a phase factor in the electron wave function in the circumferential direction and leads to a shift in the energy bands .",
    "the value of the energy shift depends on the strength of the applied field and on the orbital magnetic moment .",
    "this can be observed e.g. as a change in the band gap structure by measuring the conductance of a single nanotube suspended between two electrodes @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field influences the motion of electrons around the circumference of cn , giving rise to persistent currents @xcite which at low temperatures do not decay .",
    "persistent current multiplied by the cn cross section give the orbital magnetic moment @xmath0 directed along the axis .",
    "+ in the present paper we calculate @xmath0 in single - wall cns in the tight binding approximation for various chiralities , lengths and radii ( provided that @xmath2 ) , for a range of electron or hole doping values .",
    "we study both isolated nanotubes , where the number of electrons @xmath3 and nanotubes connected to a particle reservoir ( e.g. as a part of a circuit ) , where the chemical potential @xmath4 .",
    "+ we find that in undoped nanotubes the character of the magnetic moment depends only on the cn s conducting properties ( i.e. whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting ) , its length and the temperature of the system . on the other hand , in hole- or electron doped nanotubes",
    "the behaviour of @xmath5 depends strongly on the chirality of the nanotube , on its size , and on the degree of hole or electron doping . + in our model calculations we study nanotubes in the ballistic regime and we work in the non - interacting electrons approximation which has yielded good agreement with experimental results in mesoscopic rings @xcite and in carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "carbon nanotubes are commonly considered and analysed as rolled - up graphene planes .",
    "we follow here the same approach , working in the basis in which the lattice generators are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and the length unit is the length of the @xmath8 bond , 1.42 @xcite .",
    "a nanotube is uniquely defined by four parameters @xmath9 , which define its circumference and length vectors : @xmath10 in most theoretical works on carbon nanotubes the tube under examination is considered to be infinitely long , resulting in a continuous spectrum of momenta along the cn . since the real cns are very long but finite , we consider @xmath11 . therefore ,",
    "the momentum is quantized in both directions .",
    "we chose the longitudinal boundary conditions to be cyclic : @xmath12 where @xmath13 stands for the direction parallel to the length of the nanotube .",
    "we found no significant differences between currents in cyclic and open longitudinal boundary conditions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "+ the magnetic field is applied parallel to the axis of the cn .",
    "the aharonov - bohm phase factor modifies the transverse boundary condition ( in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for the direction parallel to the circumference of the nanotube , @xmath16 is the magnetic flux and @xmath17 is the quantum flux unit .",
    "the momentum vector @xmath18 can be defined either in the @xmath19 or @xmath20 basis .",
    "we use the second one throughout our calculations , the first only in the dispersion relation .",
    "when @xmath21 , the currents carried by states with @xmath18 and @xmath22 do not cancel out , and a net current appears . at fields accessible in labs",
    "only a part of the bohm - aharonov period @xmath23 could be observed in nanotubes of small diameter .",
    "for example , in a cn with radius @xmath24 a magnetic field @xmath25 of the order of 210 t is required to observe the full @xmath23 period . + currents running along the circumference of the cn",
    "induce in the nanotube a magnetic moment parallel to its axis .",
    "the magnetic moment of an electron close to the fermi level can also be calculated by the following reasoning .",
    "+ the energy gap between conduction and valence states close to the fermi surface ( fs ) is @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the fermi points where the valence and conduction bands of graphene meet .",
    "the bohm - aharonov effect shifts the allowed @xmath28 by @xmath29 , @xmath30 resulting also in the energy shift @xmath31 @xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the orbital magnetic moment of an electron at ( or the closest to ) the fermi surface @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the unit vector along the cn axis ) .",
    "this shift of the energy states results in the change of the band gap and can convert a metallic cn into a semiconducting one and vice versa .",
    "therefore , from now on by metallic and semiconducting we understand cn s which display this behaviour at @xmath36 .",
    "+ the change of the band gap with the magnetic field has been investigated in three independent measurements @xcite and in the first one helped to determine the magnitude of the orbital magnetic moment of an electron at the fs , @xmath37 . a good agreement between the experimental and the theoretical values",

    "whose length is commensurate with their circumference , the period of the aharonov - bohm oscillations is a fraction of @xmath23 .",
    "the full dependence of @xmath5 on the doping , both in isolated ( @xmath3 ) and connected ( @xmath51 ) nanotubes shows several interesting features .",
    "+ first , as long as the doping does not exceed @xmath108 , the orbital magnetic moments fall in two distinct classes , depending on whether the nanotube was originally metallic or semiconducting .",
    "this feature appears in both conditions , in fig .",
    "[ fig : smallcone - constn ] we show it for @xmath3 .",
    "it is due to the fact that the fermi surface for small dopings is a set of nearly circular loops , meeting at the same angle the momentum lines of any chirality ( cf .",
    "[ fig : bzones]b ) . +     +    as the fermi surface loses the circular symmetry , at larger values of doping , differences appear between nanotubes of the same type of conduction and different chiralities ( cf . fig . [",
    "fig : bzones]c ) .",
    "this effect shows both in the case of nanotube isolated and forming part of a circuit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : carpets ] we show it for @xmath51 . the doping level at which the maximum amplitude of the magnetic moments is reached ( marked by straight lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : carpets ] ) depends on the chirality of the cn .",
    "cns can be one of the basic ingredients of the future nanoelectronic devices .",
    "therefore their behaviour in the magnetic field is of big importance .",
    "the magnetic field has a strong effect on the electronic structure of the cn  it can be used to tune the energy spectrum .",
    "this raises the possibility of controlling the energy levels through an external field , opening the door to further studies of fundamental properties of nanotubes as well as technological applications .",
    "+ when applied parallel to the tube axis , the magnetic field creates orbital magnetic moments , which depend strongly on the chirality , length and doping level of the cn .",
    "+ the results of our model calculations show that the behaviour of the orbital magnetic moment in single - wall nanotubes has the following features : + 1 ) the temperature diminishes its amplitude and smoothes out sharp features in the @xmath86 dependence , which in doped nanotubes can even change the character of the response from diamagnetic at low t to paramagnetic at high t ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : armch ] ) .",
    "+ 2 ) its dependence on @xmath16 is the same in electron- and hole - doped cns in temperatures up to 300k , in nanotubes both isolated and forming part of a circuit + 3 ) is nearly independent of @xmath80 in half - filled cns and depends on @xmath80 in the doped ones + 4 ) scales with length in both pure and doped cns + 5 ) is independent of chirality for pure cns and depends strongly on chirality in doped nanotubes .",
    "+ it is well known that in the magnetic field parallel to the axis a metallic cn can be converted into a semiconducting one and vice versa @xcite .",
    "this has been recently demonstrated as a change of the band gap in a series of experiments @xcite .",
    "this extraodrinary feature can be clearly seen also in the @xmath16 dependence of the orbital magnetic moment .",
    "+ the nanotubes for which @xmath42 exhibits a steep rise are metallic , otherwise they are semiconducting .",
    "inspection of e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : chirality - independent ] shows that the nanotube denoted by ( m ) , metallic at @xmath109 transforms into a semiconducting one at @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) , whereas the semiconducting nanotube denoted by ( s ) becomes metallic at @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath0 in the range of 0 - 20 t are given in tables [ tab : constm ] and [ tab : constn ] .",
    "+ the relation between @xmath37 calculated and measured in @xcite and @xmath42 discussed in this paper is the following .",
    "@xmath37 , being the magnetic moment of an electron at ( or close to ) the fermi point , is calculated in the energy range where its dispersion relation is a linear function of @xmath18 , therefore @xmath37 is independent of the flux .",
    "the total magnetic moment @xmath42 is calculated as a sum over all @xmath18 states , thus containing terms with nonlinear dispersion relation which cause the flux dependence of the magnetic moment .",
    "moreover , @xmath42 calculated from eq .",
    "( [ muorb - with - t ] ) takes into account the temperature dependence of the energy level occupation .",
    "this effect has been neglected in the calculation of @xmath37 . + whereas the measurements of the band gap as a function of @xmath25 give the information about @xmath37 ( which is actually the orbital moment unit , @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the unit of the persistent current ) , the full @xmath86 could be measured in other experiments which will be sensitive to it . + in our opinion this measurement may be possible in a setup with a double walled cn .",
    "the outer shell can be used as a field detector .",
    "the current running along it would be modified by the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the precise measurement of this current , compared with the current in identical but single - walled cn could reveal the magnetic moment produced by the inner tube .",
    "+       in this paper we have given a survey of the properties of the orbital magnetic moments for single - wall nanotubes of different chiralities with different radii and length , and for various values of electron or hole doping , at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "in multiwall nanotubes these dependences are more complex , since all shells are penetrated by the magnetic field and all must be taken into account .",
    "the magnetic moments are then a superposition of moments from different shells . some aspects of this problem have recently been discussed in @xcite .",
