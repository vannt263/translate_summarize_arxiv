    "in hydraulics , deterministic numerical modelling tools based on approximating solutions of the 2d shallow water equations ( swe ) system are commonly used for flood hazard assessment @xcite .",
    "this category of tools describes water free surface behavior ( mainly elevation and discharge ) according to an engineering conceptualization , aiming to provide to decision makers information that often consists in a flood map of maximal water depths . as underlined in @xcite , good practice in hydraulic numerical modelling",
    "is for modellers to know in detail the chain of concepts in the modelling process and to supply to decision makers possible doubts and deviation between what has been simulated and the reality .",
    "indeed , in considered swe based models , sources of uncertainties come from ( @xmath2 ) hypothesis in the mathematical description of the natural phenomena , ( @xmath3 ) numerical aspects when solving the model , ( @xmath4 ) lack of knowledge in input parameters and ( @xmath5 ) natural phenomena inherent randomness .",
    "errors arising from @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 may be considered as belonging to the category of epistemic uncertainties ( that can be reduced _",
    "e.g. _ by improvement of description , measurement ) .",
    "errors of type @xmath5 are seen as stochastic errors ( where randomness is considered as a part of the natural process , _",
    "e.g. _ in climatic born data ) @xcite . at the same time , the combination of the increasing availability of high resolution ( hr ) topographic data and of high performance computing ( hpc ) structures , leads to a growing production of hr flood models @xcite . for non - practitioner",
    ", the level of accuracy of hr topographic data might be erroneously interpreted as the level of accuracy of the hr flood models , disregarding uncertainty inherent to this type of data use , not without standing the fact that other types of above mentioned errors occur in hydraulic modelling .",
    "topographic data is a major input for flood models , especially for complex environment such as urban and industrial areas , where a detailed topography helps for a better description of the physical properties of the modelled system @xcite . in the case of an urban or industrial environment ,",
    "a topographic dataset is considered to be of hr when it allows to include in the topographic information the elevation of infra - metric elements @xcite .",
    "these infra - metric elements ( such as sidewalks , road - curbs , walls , _ etc .",
    "_ ) are features that influence flow path and overland flow free surface properties . at megacities scale ,",
    "hr topographic datasets are getting commonly available at an infra - metric resolution using modern gathering technologies ( such as lidar , photogrammetry ) through the use of aerial vectors like unmanned aerial vehicle or specific flight campaign @xcite .",
    "moreover , modern urban reconstruction methods based on features classification carried out by photo - interpretation process , allow to have high accuracy and highly detailed topographic information @xcite .",
    "photo - interpreted hr datasets allow to generate hr dems including classes of impervious above ground features @xcite . therefore generated hr dems can include above ground features elevation information depending on modeller selection among classes .",
    "based on hr classified topographic datasets , produced hr digital elevation model ( dem ) can have a vertical and horizontal accuracy up to @xmath6 @xcite .    even though being of high accuracy , produced hr dems are assorted with the same types of errors as coarser dems .",
    "errors are due to limitations in measurement techniques and to operational restrictions .",
    "these errors can be categorized as : ( @xmath2 ) systematic , due to bias in measurement and processing ; ( @xmath3 ) nuggets ( or blunder ) , which are local abnormal value resulting from equipment or user failure , or to occurrence of abnormal phenomena in the gathering process ( _ e.g. _ birds passing between the ground and the measurement device ) or ( @xmath4 ) random variations , due to measurement / operation inherent limits ( see @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "the amount of data that composes a hr classified topographic dataset is massive .",
    "consequently , to handle the hr dataset and to avoid prohibitive computational time , hydraulic modellers make choices to integrate this type of data in the hydraulic model , possibly decreasing hr dem quality and introducing uncertainty @xcite .",
    "as recalled in the literature @xcite , in hr flood models , effects of uncertainties related to hr topographic data use on simulated flow is not yet quantitatively understood .      to evaluate uncertainty in deterministic models , uncertainty analysis ( ua ) and sensitivity analysis ( sa )",
    "have started to be used @xcite and @xcite and become broadly applied for a wild range of environmental modelling problems @xcite .",
    "ua consists in the propagation of uncertainty sources through model , and then focuses on the quantification of uncertainties in model output allowing robustness to be checked @xcite .",
    "sa aims to study how uncertainty in a model output can be linked and allocated proportionally to the contribution of each input uncertainties .",
    "both ua and sa are essential to analyze complex systems @xcite , as study of uncertainties related to input parameters is of prime interest for applied practitioners willing to decrease uncertainties in their models results @xcite .    in 1d and 2d flood modelling studies , approaches based on sampling based methods",
    "are becoming used in practical applications for ua . for sa , depending on applications and objectives , different categories of variance based approaches have been recently applied in flood modelling studies ( mainly in 1d ) such as local sensitivity analysis ( lsa ) @xcite or more recently , a global sensitivity analysis ( gsa ) based on a screening method has been implemented in 2d flood modelling application @xcite .",
    "lsa focuses on fixed point in the space of the input and aims to address model behavior near parameters nominal value to safely assume local linear dependences on the parameter .",
    "lsa can use either a differentiation or a continuous approach @xcite .",
    "lsa based on differentiation approach performs simulations with slight differences in a given input parameter and computes the difference in the results variation , with respect to the parameter variation .",
    "lsa based on continuous approach differentiates directly the equations of the model , creating sensitivity equation @xcite .",
    "the advantages of lsa approaches are that they are not resource demanding in terms of computational cost , drawback being that the space of input is locally explored assuming linear effects only .",
    "linear effects means that given change in an input parameter introduces a proportional change in model output , in opposition to nonlinear effects .",
    "lsa approaches perform reasonably well with swe system even if nonlinear effects occur punctually ( see @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , important nonlinear effects in model output might arise when parameters are interacting and when solution becomes discontinuous .",
    "lsa consequently becomes not suited @xcite in such a context , which is likely to occur in case of 2d swe based simulation of overland flow .",
    "gsa approaches rely on sampling based methods for uncertainty propagation , willing to fully map the space of possible model predictions from the various model uncertain input parameters and then , allow to rank the significance of the input parameter uncertainty contribution to the model output variability @xcite .",
    "gsa approaches are well suited to be applied with models having nonlinear behavior and when interaction among parameters occurs @xcite .",
    "these approaches going through an intensive sampling are computationally demanding , as they most often rely on monte - carlo ( mc ) approach , even though some more parsimonious sampling method such as latin hypercube or pseudo - monte carlo are sometimes applied ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "most commonly , gsa approaches rely on :    * screening methods , such as morris method @xcite ; * sobol indices computation , that considers the output hyperspace ( @xmath7 ) as a function ( @xmath8 ) and performs a functional decomposition @xcite or a fourier decomposition ( fast method ) of the variance .",
    "as fully detailed in @xcite , screening techniques ( _ e.g. _ morris method ) allow to classify uncertain input parameters in three categories : those that have negligible effect ; those that have linear effect ; and those that have nonlinear effects or effects in interaction with other input parameters .",
    "sobol indices ( or variance - based sensitivity indices ) will explain the share of the total variance in the space of output due to each uncertain input parameter and/or input interaction .",
    "gsa has started to be applied in 1d hydraulic modelling in practical applications for hierarchical ranking of uncertain input parameters @xcite . as for 1d , applying a gsa to flooding issues in 2d modelling requires method awareness among the community , practical tools development and computational resources availability .",
    "moreover an analysis on spatialization of input uncertain parameters and on output variable is specifically needed in 2d @xcite .",
    "recently , gsa using a screening method has been implemented in 2d flood modelling application @xcite tackling ranking of uncertain input parameters using points and zonal approaches .",
    "computation of sensitivity maps such as maps of sobol index is a promising outcome that has been achieved for other types of water related issues @xcite .      to date ,",
    "ua and sa have not yet been performed to specifically study uncertainty in 2d urban flood simulations related to hr classified topographic data integration . indeed , due to the curse of dimensionality , sa methods have seldom been applied to environmental models with both spatially distributed inputs and outputs @xcite .",
    "such a problematic raises needs of specific tools , computational resource and methods application . among sa methods , a global sensitivity analysis ( gsa ) is implemented in this study .",
    "gsa approach is selected over lsa as 2d overland flow process simulation through swe system of partial differential equations , is viewed as being largely nonlinear , with discontinuous solution and interactions between parameters .",
    "this paper aims to study uncertainty related to hr topographic data integration in 2d flood modelling approach .",
    "the objective of the study is to perform an ua and a sa on two categories of uncertain parameters ( measurement errors and uncertainties related to operator choices ) relative to the use of hr classified topographic data in a 2d urban flood model having spatial inputs and outputs . among sa methods , a global sensitivity analysis ( gsa )",
    "is implemented to produce sensitivity maps based on sobol index computation .",
    "carrying out these objectives will demonstrate the feasibility , the added values and limitations of ua and sa implementation in 2d hydraulic modelling , in a context where spatial variability and interaction are likely to occur .",
    "moreover , modeller knowledge about challenges and expectations related to hr classified data use in hr urban flood modelling will be enhanced .",
    "the study case is the low var river valley ( nice , france ) where flooding events occurred in the last decades in the highly urbanized downstream part of the valley @xcite .",
    "the output of interest is the overland flow water level ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the used hr dems are based on classified 3d dataset created from photointerpretation procedure .",
    "a proof of concept of gsa application to 2d hydraulic modelling voluntary choosing a resource requiring problem has been developed and the method applied over an innovative concern related to the use of hr topographic data .    following this introduction ( part [ sec : intro ] ) , the next part of the paper ( part [ sec : method ] ) introduces the test case context for sa methods uses , then enhances description of used hr topographic dataset , gives overview of implemented methodology for the spatial gsa and introduces developed tools . the third part ( [ sec : results ] ) of",
    "the paper presents results of ua and gsa , first at punctual then at spatial levels .",
    "the last parts ( part [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : summary - and - conclusions ] ) discuss outcomes and limits of our approach , providing concluding remarks .",
    "the study area is a @xmath9 domain that represents the last five downstream kilometers of the low var valley , located in nice , france ( figure [ fig1 ] ) . in the test basin ,",
    "two major river flood events occurred in last decades ( @xmath10 of november @xmath11 ; @xmath12 of november @xmath13 ) . a hr topographic data gathering campaign fully covered the domain in @xmath14 .",
    "the characteristics of the river basin and of the @xmath11 flood event are described in @xcite . between @xmath11 and @xmath14 ( date of event used for simulation and the date of the hr topographic data gathering campaign ) ,",
    "the studied area has considerably changed .",
    "indeed , levees , dikes and urban structures have been implemented , changing physical properties of the river / urban flood plain system .",
    "thus , the objective is not to reproduce the event , but simply to use the framework of this event as a case study to carry out the ua and the sa . as mentioned in the introduction section",
    ", a gsa approach using sobol index is suitable to compute sensitivity maps @xcite .",
    "the method implemented to carry out the spatial gsa is presented in detail in @xcite , and the upcoming description of the implemented gsa gives to the reader a summary of key elements for understanding .",
    "the design and the quality of a photo - interpreted dataset are highly dependent on photogrammetry dataset quality , on classes definition , and on method used for digitalization of vectors @xcite .",
    "reader can find details regarding principle of modern aerial photogrammetry technology in @xcite .",
    "the photogrammetric campaign carried out over the lower var valley , at a low flight elevation , allowed a pixel resolution at the ground level of @xmath6 and had a high overlapping ratio ( @xmath15 ) among aerial pictures .",
    "consequently , these characteristics allowed the production of a high quality photogrammetric dataset . using the photogrammetric dataset ,",
    "the photo - interpretation process has been carried out , to create a classified vectorial dataset through digitalization of classes of polylines , polygons and points .",
    "this photo - interpreted dataset has been designed with a total number of @xmath16 different classes representing large and thin above ground features ( _ e.g. _ buildings , concrete walls , road - gutters , stairs , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "the specificities of the given photo - interpretation process can be found in @xcite . for hydraulic modelling purpose ,",
    "@xmath17 classes over the @xmath16 are considered to represent above ground features impacting overland flow path , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( a , b ) .",
    "classified data mean horizontal and vertical accuracy is @xmath18 .",
    "errors in photo - interpretation which results from feature misinterpretation , addition or omission are estimated to represent @xmath19 of the total number of elements . to control average level of accuracy and level of errors in photo - interpretation ,",
    "the municipality has carried out a terrestrial control of data accuracy over @xmath20 of the domain covered by the photogrammetric campaign .        for our application ,",
    "the 3d classified data of the low var river valley is used to generate specific dem adapted to surface hydraulic modelling . for the gsa approach ( see next section ) , only the input dem changes from one simulation to another and the hydraulic parameters of the model are set identically for the simulations .",
    "hydraulic conditions of the study case implemented in the models can be summarized as follow : a constant discharge of @xmath21 is applied as input boundary condition to reach a steady flow state condition almost completely filling the var river bed .",
    "this steady condition is the initial condition for the gsa and a @xmath22 hours estimated hydrograph from the @xmath11 flood event is simulated @xcite .",
    "the manning s friction coefficient ( @xmath23 ) is spatially uniform on overland flow areas with a standard value of @xmath24 , which corresponds to a concrete surface .",
    "no energy losses properties have been included in the 2d hydraulic model to represent the bridges , piers or weirs .",
    "downstream boundary condition is an open sea level ( neumann boundary condition ) to let water flows out .",
    "falling within category of gsa approaches , screening methods allow in a computationally parsimonious way , to discriminate among numerous uncertain input parameters those that have little effect from those having linear , nonlinear or combined effects in output variance @xcite . screening methods principle consists in fixing an input parameters set and performing an initial run .",
    "then , for one parameter at a time , a new value of the parameter is randomly chosen and a new run is performed .",
    "variation in the run output is checked .",
    "this operation is completed for all the parameters , @xmath23 times with @xmath23 equals to the total number of input parameters .",
    "screening methods perform well to discriminate influencing parameters on output variability with 2d flood modelling studies @xcite .",
    "gsa approaches relying on sobol index computation go one step further , allowing to quantify the contribution to the output variance of the main effect of each input parameters @xcite .",
    "sobol index is based on functional decomposition of variance ( anova ) , considering @xmath25 the model output of interest as follow : @xmath26 ; where @xmath27 is the model function , @xmath28 are @xmath2 independent input uncertain parameters with known distribution .",

    "the implemented gsa follows standard steps used for such type of approach as summarized in @xcite or in @xcite .",
    "the steps of the method are presented in the figure [ fig2 ] : specification of the problem notably by choosing uncertain parameters and output of interest ( step a ) ; assessing probability density function ( pdf ) of uncertain parameters ( step b ) ; propagating uncertainty , using a random sampling approach in our case ( step c ) ; ranking the contribution of each input parameters regarding the output variance ( step d ) .",
