    "the hipparcos catalogue of parallaxes ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) will improve this distance measurement .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present an estimate based on the comparison between the red clump giants measured by hipparcos and by ogle ( optical gravitational lensing experiment , cf .",
    "udalski et al .",
    "these stars are the metal rich equivalent of the better known horizontal branch stars , and theoretical models predict that their absolute luminosity only weakly depends on their age and chemical composition ( seidel , demarque , & weinberg 1989 ; castellani , chieffi , & straniero 1992 ; jimenez , flynn , & kotoneva 1997 ) .",
    "indeed the ogle color - magnitude diagram of stars in baade s window ( udalski et al .",
    "1993 ; paczyski et al .",
    "1994 , their fig.1 ; kiraga , paczyski & stanek 1997 , their fig.6 ) , and the hipparcos absolute magnitude - color diagram ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 , their fig.3 ) clearly show how compact the red clump is . in this paper",
    "we determine the variance in the absolute i band magnitude to be only @xmath12 mag .",
    "any method of the galactocentric distance determination which is based on stars suffers from at least four problems :    1 .",
    "the accuracy depends on the absolute magnitude determination for the nearby stars .",
    "interstellar extinction has to be determined for the stars near the galactic center as well as for those near the sun .",
    "3 .   the masses , ages , and chemical composition may be different for the stars near the galactic center and for their counterparts near the sun .",
    "the statistical error is large if the number of objects is small .",
    "the red clump giants are the only type of stars which do not suffer from the fourth problem . in spite of their large number and sound theoretical understanding",
    "these stars have seldom been used for the galactic structure studies",
    ". however , recently stanek ( 1995 ) and stanek et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) used these stars to map the galactic bar , and also to map the interstellar extinction in baade s window ( woniak & stanek 1996 ; stanek 1996 ) . in this paper",
    "we compare the absolute magnitudes of @xmath0 nearby red clump stars with accurate ( better than 10% ) trigonometric parallaxes measured by hipparcos with the apparent magnitudes of the red clump stars measured by the ogle in baade s window .",
    "this comparison gives the galactocentric distance in a single step .",
    "in the last section we discuss various effects which have to be evaluated in order to reduce the systematic error .",
    "inspection of the color - magnitude diagrams based on hipparcos and ogle data reveal a strong dependence of the visual magnitude of red clump giants on their color , while their @xmath13-band magnitudes reveal no color dependence .",
    "thus , on purely observational grounds , the @xmath13-band turns out to be the best in the applications in which the red clump stars are used as standard candles .",
    "it is possible that bolometric corrections to the @xmath13-band are very small for these moderately cool stars , and theoretical models show only weak dependence of @xmath14 on either age or chemical composition ( seidel , demarque , & weinberg 1989 ; castellani , chieffi , & straniero 1992 ; jimenez , flynn , & kotoneva 1997 ) .    using the extinction map of stanek ( 1996 ) with the zero point determined by gould , popowski & terndrup ( 1997 ) and by alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) we selected the region of baade s window with @xmath15 , to minimize the effects of a possible error in the ratio @xmath16 . the @xmath17 color - magnitude diagram for this part of baade s window",
    "is shown in fig.1 .",
    "we divided the red clump region into five color bins and we fitted the observed distribution of the stars in each bin with a function @xmath18,\\ ] ] where the first two terms describe a fit to the `` background '' distribution of the red giant stars , and the gaussian term represents a fit to the red clump itself .",
    "the locations of five points with the vertical error bars in fig.1 correspond to the values of @xmath19 and their formal @xmath20 errors for the five color bins .",
    "no statistically significant color trend is apparent in @xmath19 .",
    "the hipparcos based absolute magnitude - color diagram is shown in fig.2 for the stars with parallaxes measured to better than 10% .",
    "the cousins @xmath21 colors in the catalog come from various sources . for this study we used only those stars for which the source of @xmath22 was labeled a , c , e , f , or g , i.e. those for which i - band photometry was available .",
    "there are 664 such stars within the dashed rectangle in fig.2 .",
    "we divided them into two color bins and fitted their distribution with the formula analogous to that given in eq.1 , with the @xmath23 replaced with the @xmath24 .",
    "there is no significant color trend in @xmath24 .",
    "given the fact that the average luminosity of the red clump stars appears to be independent of their color in baade s window ( fig.1 ) and in the solar neighborhood ( fig.2 ) , it seems safe to determine the distance to the galactic center by comparing these two populations .",
    "it is also very fortunate that even though the bulk of the bulge population is redder , and hence it seems to be more metal rich than the solar neighborhood , there is a full overlap in the colors . in this first approximation",
    "we neglect the extinction of the hipparcos red clump giants as their average distance is only @xmath25 .",
    "we selected the red clump stars in the color range @xmath26 in baade s window ( there were 7174 of them ) and @xmath27 in hipparcos catalog , and we fitted both distributions with eq.1 .",
    "we obtained @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "therefore the distance modulus is @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , with the formal statistical error of only @xmath32 .",
    "the distribution of the two groups of the red clump stars as a function of their absolute i - band magnitude is shown in fig.3 with two histograms as well as with two analytical fits of the type described by the eq.1 .",
    "all these distributions are normalized .",
    "the gaussian fitted to the ogle red clump distribution has @xmath33 and the gaussian fitted to the hipparcos distribution has @xmath34 .",
    "the distribution of the red clump stars as a function of their @xmath22 color is shown in fig.4 .",
    "it is clear that the bulge population is redder , and presumably more metal rich than the nearby disk population .",
    "the very small formal statistical error for our galactocentric distance follows from the very large number of red clump stars measured by hipparcos and ogle .",
    "the number of these stars is several orders of magnitude larger than the number of either rr lyrae or mira variables , and the observed dispersion in their magnitudes is only @xmath35 .",
    "however , in addition to very small statistical errors there are much larger systematic errors , some of which we try to estimate and correct for .",
    "we checked if the 10% error limit adopted by us was not too generous , and we repeated the analysis with a more stringent 5% upper limit to the parallax errors .",
    "this reduced the number of stars within the rectangle shown in fig.2 from 664 to 240 , and gave @xmath36 , well within small statistical errors of @xmath37 obtained for the 10% sample .",
    "the dispersions were also similar : @xmath38 mag for the 10% sample and @xmath39 mag for the 5% sample .    by selecting stars with accurate parallaxes from the hipparcos catalog we introduced a distance bias which depends on the absolute magnitude :",
    "the stars which are intrinsically brighter can be accurately measured out to a larger distance . therefore , there are relatively more bright stars in our hipparcos sample than in our ogle sample , as it is apparent in fig.3 .",
    "the difference in the slope of the red giant `` background '' , i.e. the different value of the ` b ' coefficient in eq.1 , introduces a shift in the location of the gaussian peak describing the red clump . in order to correct for the differences in the two samples we multiplied the number of hipparcos stars in each magnitude bin by the factor @xmath40 following this procedure the new normalized fit to the modified hipparcos histogram gave new values of the @xmath41 coefficients consistent with their baade s window values , and also a new value of the gaussian peak : @xmath42 , which differs by @xmath43 from our original estimate .    in order to estimate the effect of interstellar extinction we selected a sub - sample of 228 hipparcos stars with the distance @xmath44 pc , and we determined the parameters of the best fit to the luminosity function described with eq.1 , correcting for the ( now reduced ) distance bias in the way described in the previous paragraph .",
    "we found that @xmath45 , and @xmath46 mag for these nearby stars , with the average distance @xmath47 .",
    "for the remaining 437 hipparcos red clump giants with the distance @xmath48 we obtained @xmath49 , @xmath50 mag and the average distance @xmath51 .",
    "the more distant stars are fainter by 0.098 mag , with the difference in average distance being @xmath52 .",
    "the most obvious explanation for this difference is the interstellar extinction . extrapolating these results to the distance @xmath53 , and therefore to zero extinction",
    ", we obtain @xmath54 .",
    "our final estimate of the correct average magnitude of the nearby red clump stars is 0.088 mag brighter than our original crude estimate .",
    "we adopt this difference as our crude estimate of the possible systematic error in the absolute magnitude determination of the nearby red clump giants .",
    "the centroid of the gaussian distribution of red clump giants in baade s window corresponds to the distance which differs from the galactocentric distance for two reasons .",
    "first , because of bar asymmetry the point with the highest space density of the red clump stars seen in the direction @xmath55 is somewhat closer than the galactic center .",
    "second , the volume within the observed solid angle increases with the distance , which implies that we see more stars on the far side than on the near side of the bar , and the observed centroid is shifted to a somewhat larger distance than the location of the highest space density of the bar stars .",
    "we used the e2 bar model of stanek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to calculate the two opposing effects , and we found that the galactocentric distance modulus is larger by @xmath56 than the distance modulus obtained by us for the apparent centroid of the star distribution in baade s window .",
    "therefore , the apparent magnitude of red clump giants at the galactic center distance , corrected for reddening , is @xmath57 mag , with the error due to our model estimated at 0.02 mag .",
    "a larger contribution to the error comes from zero point in the interstellar extinction , estimated to be @xmath58 mag ( gould , popowski & terndrup 1997 ; alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) .    combining the corrected values of the absolute magnitudes of the nearby red clump stars , @xmath59 , with the apparent magnitude of the red clump stars at the galactocentric distance ,",
    "@xmath60 , we obtain the corrected distance modulus to the galactic center : @xmath61 , and the corresponding distance @xmath62 .",
    "there is yet another type of a systematic error possible : the age , the chemical composition , and the masses of red clump giants may be systematically different in the bulge / bar and near the sun .",
    "the apparent systematic difference in the colors implies that the two populations are in fact different .",
    "recent stellar evolutionary models ( jimenez et al . 1997 ) indicate that in the age range @xmath63 billion years the effective temperature is dominated by the metallicity .",
    "this suggests that the bulge population is on average more metal rich than the solar region .",
    "this seems to be in conflict with mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) , who found that giants in the bulge and locally have similar metallicity .",
    "it also seems that among the bulge and local giants the most extreme stars are about equally super metal - rich ( castro et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "it is not clear at this time what is the reason for the major difference in colors between the bulge and the local clump giants , but at least two possibilities may be considered .",
    "the spectroscopic samples are relatively small , and the selection criteria are not clear . on the other hand ,",
    "the photometric samples are more complete , or at least they should have no color bias .",
    "it is possible , that while the range of metallicity in the bulge and near the sun is similar , the distributions are different , with the super metal - rich stars more common in the bulge .",
    "another possibility is that photometry and spectroscopy refer to different metallicities .",
    "the @xmath64 color is determined mostly by the effective temperature , which in turn depends on the photospheric continuum opacity in stars with deep convective envelopes , such as the red clump giants .",
    "it is not obvious that the spectroscopic metallicity based on line opacities is weighted in the same way as the photometric metallicity based on continuum opacity . in any case , the issue of color difference has to be resolved for the distance estimate based on the clump giants to be trusted .",
    "we found empirically that the average absolute magnitude of the red clump stars as measured in the cousin s i - band is independent on their @xmath22 color .",
    "it is important to reproduce this property with theoretical models , to have a better assessment of the robustness of our assertion , i.e. to have theoretical values of @xmath24 calculated for a broad range of stellar ages and chemical compositions .",
    "note that stellar populations are different in the galactic bulge and in the solar neighborhood , and a theoretical understanding of the @xmath65 relation is highly desirable .    among the various stellar distance indicators the red clump giants are likely to be the best for determining the galactocentric distance because there are so many of them .",
    "in particular hipparcos provided accurate distance determinations for almost 2,000 such stars , but unfortunately i - band photometry is available for only @xmath66 of them .",
    "it is important to obtain i - band photometry for all hipparcos red clump giants in order to make a better correction for at least two effects : the distance bias in the catalog and the interstellar extinction .",
    "it would be useful to make accurate i - band photometry for all @xmath67 stars in the tycho catalogue ( h@xmath68 g et al .",
    "another important work which will be done soon with the forthcoming ogle-2 @xmath69 photometry of @xmath70 stars in the bulge ( udalski , kubiak & szymaski 1997 ) , is a better bulge / bar model and a better extinction map of that region .",
    "this will reduce the uncertainty in the ogle / hipparcos comparison ."
