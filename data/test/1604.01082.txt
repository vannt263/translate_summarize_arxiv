    "the markovian quantum master equation ( qme )  @xcite provides a key paradigm for the study of nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
    "the structure of this framework is transparent , the generality of its derivation is sufficient , and the approximations applied are well defined , especially when the system hamiltonian is time - independent . in the last decades , therefore , the markovian qme has allowed a broad range of applications for the study of open quantum systems that have _ time - independent _ system hamiltonians  @xcite . in recent years , however , the quantum dynamics driven by _ time - dependent _ external field ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] ) has been an area of growing importance in various contexts , such as adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc )  @xcite , quantum annealing ( qa )  @xcite , quantum heat engines  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices  @xcite , and semiconductor quantum dots  @xcite because the external driving is essential for the use of the quantum systems as nontrivial physical resources .",
    "nevertheless , no general way of rigorously constructing the markovian qme is currently known for the time - dependent system hamiltonian , @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "one therefore often comes across a fundamental problem of describing the open quantum dynamics simultaneously subject to the external driving .    one possible way to circumvent",
    "this difficulty is the floquet formalism if the system hamiltonian is driven periodically in time  @xcite .",
    "however , this approach is obviously inadequate in situations with no periodicity .",
    "another natural approach is then to assume the slow temporal change of @xmath1 .",
    "however , the following two questions immediately arise in turn : how can we quantify the temporal change timescale of @xmath1 , which we denote by @xmath0 , and what is the other timescale to be compared with @xmath0 when we say slow ? in relation to these questions , various different statements can be found in literature . in particular ,",
    "an important assumption employed by many authors is the adiabatic regime that satisfies the ordinary adiabatic theorem  @xcite , in which any non - adiabatic transitions between instantaneous eigenstates are suppressed  @xcite .",
    "however , under this assumption , any non - adiabatic effect can not be discussed despite the recent experimental demand ; in the context of the qa , for example , it is essential to consider the non - adiabatic transitions with dissipation in practice  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , another assumption sometimes encountered is the slow temporal change of @xmath1 compared to the decay timescale of the bath correlation function , @xmath2 .",
    "however , due to the lack of the general definition of @xmath0 , there is no consensus for this condition even if simple systems , e.g.  the dissipative landau - zener ( dlz ) models , are considered  @xcite .",
    "the conditions for the markovian qme are thus subject to long - standing debate when the system hamiltonian depends on time , originally started from davies and spohn  @xcite .    in this article ,",
    "our purpose is two - fold .",
    "first , under the weak - coupling approximation ( wca ) , we settle this long - standing debate by studying the conditions to justify the markovian qme with @xmath1 in a general manner .",
    "we introduce an explicit definition of @xmath0 and approximations required to obtain the qme under the wca . as a result , we shall see that the markovian qme is naturally derived _ without the adiabatic theorem_. our route of the formulation successfully removes the ambiguities of the relevant conditions .",
    "second , in a broad range of situations , we further find that there is no need to even assume the slow temporal change of @xmath1 compared to @xmath2 .",
    "this is in contrast to the common belief that the markovian description breaks down when the system hamiltonian changes more rapidly than @xmath2  @xcite . in consequence ,",
    "the non - adiabatic regime becomes definitely accessible by the markovian qme .",
    "our route of the formulation and the well - defined approximations allow us to clearly understand the structure of the framework with sufficient generality .",
    "hence , the approach is immediately applicable to a wide range of physical systems . as an example",
    ", the results are demonstrated by applying the framework to the dlz model .",
    "our scheme thus resolves the contentious issue , achieves an extension of the applicable range , and as a result opens up a new avenue for exploring the frontier in driven open quantum systems beyond the adiabatic regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : adiabaticity ] , we introduce @xmath0 that quantifies the temporal change of @xmath1 by assuming the _ closed system_. we also discuss the similarities and differences between the adiabaticity of @xmath1 and the ordinary adiabatic theorem .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : qme ] , we study the general derivation of the markovian qme under the wca . to help explain the framework clearly",
    ", we shall make a brief review of the _ time - independent _ hamiltonian case .",
    "we then introduce an approximation based on the instantaneous eigenbasis and illustrate the validity beyond the adiabatic regime . in section  [ sec : dlz ] , we demonstrate the results by applying the framework to the dlz model . finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , we conclude and give an outlook . throughout the paper",
    ", we set @xmath3 for simplicity .",
    "we consider an open quantum system with the time - dependent system hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "although this topic has been studied by many authors in the past  @xcite , there is no discussion on how to quantify the temporal change timescale @xmath0 of the system hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , in this section , we start with the definition of @xmath0 by considering the _ closed system_. for this purpose , it is convenient to consider a problem about in what condition @xmath4 remains unchanged from @xmath1 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an arbitrary time .",
    "we note that this problem is different from the traditional adiabatic theorem  @xcite in the following sense . in the adiabatic theorem ,",
    "the time evolution of the system s state @xmath7 is considered according to the schrdinger equation @xmath8 .",
    "then , one finds that the transitions between the instantaneous eigenstates are suppressed when @xmath1 changes sufficiently slowly if there is no degeneracy .",
    "in contrast , in eq .  , we do _ not _ focus on the time evolution of @xmath7 but our attention is paid to the time dependence of @xmath1 itself .",
    "therefore , it is always possible to find @xmath9 that satisfies eq .",
    ", no matter how fast @xmath1 changes when @xmath1 is analytic . in this context",
    ", @xmath9 would be arbitrary as long as it is sufficiently small compared to a certain timescale . here",
    ", in fact , it is natural to introduce @xmath10 by this certain timescale because , if @xmath10 denotes the temporal change timescale of @xmath1 , eq .",
    "should be satisfied when @xmath9 is much shorter than @xmath10 , @xmath11 therefore , we can say that @xmath1 is adiabatic , or `` slow '' , within the time @xmath9 when @xmath9 satisfies the condition of eq .  .",
    "in this sense , @xmath0 would give a clear measure for the adiabaticity of @xmath1 itself .",
    "however , eqs .   and alone do not make much practical sense because we do not know how to estimate @xmath0 . as a convenient way to obtain @xmath10 ,",
    "therefore , we use the instantaneous eigenbasis , defined by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the @xmath15-th instantaneous eigenstate and eigenenergy , respectively ; @xmath16 labels the ground state .",
    "the states @xmath13 are assumed to be normalized and nondegenerate .",
    "we then read eq .   in this basis as @xmath17 for all @xmath15",
    ". here , in a similar manner to eq .",
    ", we can separately introduce @xmath18 and @xmath19 that describe the temporal change timescales of the instantaneous eigenenergy and eigenstate .",
    "hence , the first and second approximations in eq .",
    "are appropriate , respectively , when @xmath20 as a result , @xmath10 is given by @xmath21 because @xmath22 and @xmath23 should both be satisfied for @xmath24 .",
    "since the taylor expansion of @xmath25 up to the first order yields @xmath26 , we obtain @xmath18 as @xmath27 then , one can indeed obtain @xmath22 if @xmath28 . on the other hand , for @xmath29 , @xmath30 should be satisfied when @xmath23 because @xmath31 . therefore , since @xmath32 , @xmath19 is given by @xmath33 where the maximum is taken over all @xmath34 and @xmath15 except for @xmath35 .",
    "thus , @xmath10 can be estimated from eqs .   with the instantaneous eigenbasis .",
    "for the convenience of the reader , the timescales and the situations discussed in this paper are summarized in tables  [ tbl : timescales ] and [ tbl : conditions ] .",
    "while there are a multitude of timescales , we should mention that @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the only timescales essentially introduced in this paper .",
    "the other timescales are just straightforward extensions of previously known timescales .    at this stage ,",
    "let us discuss the time evolution of @xmath7 .",
    "this is actually equivalent to discuss the evolution operator defined by @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) denotes the chronological ( anti - chronological ) time ordering operator .",
    "the formal solution of the schrdinger equation is then given by @xmath39 with the initial time @xmath40 because @xmath41 satisfies    [ eq : evprop2 ] @xmath42    for @xmath43 later than @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we note , in addition , that the evolution operator also satisfies    [ eq : evprop1 ] @xmath46    by definition .",
    "then , if @xmath6 satisfies eq .",
    ", the evolution operator from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , i.e.  @xmath49 , can be approximated by @xmath50 where the integral variable is changed to @xmath51 [ see also eq .",
    "] in the first line and eq",
    ".   has been used in the second line .",
    "this equation means that the evolution of the eigenstates can be approximated just by the dynamical phase shift , @xmath52 when @xmath9 is much shorter than @xmath0 .",
    "these discussions based on the concept of the adiabaticity of @xmath1 will play an important role when we develop the markovian qme with @xmath1 in the following sections .    here , it would be instructive to see the similarities and differences between the adiabaticity of @xmath1 and the ordinary adiabatic theorem .",
    "for this purpose , we introduce an _ intrinsic evolution timescale _ of @xmath1 by @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the instantaneous energy gap .",
    "hence , @xmath55 also corresponds to the longest timescale of the intrinsic oscillation period in the off - diagonal density matrix elements .",
    "one can then easily confirm that the adiabatic theorem is validated if @xmath56 is satisfied for all relevant time @xmath48 ( see ref .",
    ", for example ) by using @xmath57 .",
    "equation   means that all the eigenstates @xmath13 should be adiabatic with respect to @xmath58 . in other words , the eigenstates @xmath13 should remain unchanged at least within the intrinsic oscillation period @xmath58 to satisfy the adiabatic theorem . in that case , the evolution operator @xmath41 can be approximated by @xmath59 with  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 denotes the berry connection .",
    "notice that , according to eq .  , the @xmath15-th eigenstate @xmath63 at time @xmath44 will evolve to the @xmath15-th eigenstate @xmath64 at time @xmath43 with the phase shift @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , eq .   directly means that there are no transitions between the instantaneous eigenstates .",
    "we refer to this type of dynamics as the _",
    "adiabatic evolution_. by comparing eq .   with eq .",
    "[ eq .   with eq .  ]",
    ", the adiabaticity of @xmath1 is formally similar to the adiabatic theorem .",
    "however , they are conceptually different from each other , as described below eq .  .",
    "according to eq .  , we can indeed always find @xmath9 even if @xmath0 becomes short due to a rapid change of @xmath1 . as a result , eq .",
    "is validated , in which the eigenstates are left unchanged except for their phase factors . in contrast , eq",
    ".   fails when @xmath19 becomes short due to the rapid change of @xmath1 .",
    "this is because @xmath55 is fixed once the structure of @xmath1 is determined .",
    "therefore , the adiabatic evolution [ eq .  ] is valid only when @xmath1 varies slowly to satisfy eq .  .",
    "with the help of this distinction , we shall see below that the markovian qme is naturally derived without the adiabatic theorem .",

    "we now turn to the study of the markovian qme under the wca . here , in order to fix our notations as well as to give a self - contained presentation , let us shortly review the standard steps to obtain the markovian qme . in the schrdinger picture ,",

    "case_equation   can be rewritten in a more tractable form when the system hamiltonian is time - independent ; @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 . to see this ,",
    "let us define @xmath109 where the summation in eq .",

    "therefore , the secular approximation ( sa ) , or equivalently the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , is often applied , where rapidly oscillating terms in eq .",

    "we note that this approximation is based on the oscillating forms of @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "then , we finally arrive at @xmath131 with @xmath132 which indeed results in the lindblad form .",
    "note however that the sa is justified only when all the differences of the bohr frequencies , i.e. @xmath133 for @xmath128 , are larger than the relaxation rate of the system  @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "the relaxation rate of the system @xmath134 is characterized by @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "on the other hand , we can define an intrinsic timscale @xmath137 by using the minimum of @xmath133 for @xmath128 ; @xmath138 therefore , the condition for the sa is described by @xmath139 , or equivalently , @xmath140 here , we refer to @xmath137 as the intrinsic beat timescale to distinguish from eq .  , while @xmath137 is also called the intrinsic evolution timescale  @xcite .",
    "this is because the differences of the bohr frequencies correspond to the beat frequencies of the intrinsic oscillation of the off - diagonal density matrix elements .",
    "if the condition is not satisfied , the sa sometimes leads to unphysical results and one often has to use @xmath125 or alternatively approximated lindblad qme  @xcite .",

    "although this equation can be solved numerically in principle , the numerical cost would not be low in practice because eq .",
    "requires the numerical @xmath119-integration at each time step .",
    "it is therefore desirable to analytically reduce eq .   into a similar form to @xmath125 [ eq .  ] or @xmath141 [ eq .  ] . in this context",
    ", one often assumes that @xmath1 is slowly varying , and then , replaces the bohr frequencies @xmath111 , the eigenenergies @xmath142 , and the eigenstates @xmath143 in the dissipators by the corresponding time - dependent ones , @xmath144 , @xmath14 , and @xmath13 , respectively .",

    "therefore , the summation over all possible @xmath144 yields the decomposition similar to eq .  , @xmath147 again due to the completeness of the ( instantaneous ) eigenbasis .",
    "as illustrated in the previous section , the advantage to use such a decomposition was to separate the @xmath119-dependence from @xmath100 , based on the explicit calculation of the time dependence in the interaction picture [ see eq .  ] .",
    "then , the time convolution between @xmath99 and @xmath100 becomes possible [ eq .  ] .",

    "therefore , the sa is again required to obtain the lindblad form in a similar manner to the time - independent case .",
    "however , we remark that @xmath165 in @xmath160 even though @xmath130 holds true in @xmath125 because the interaction picture can not be explicitly obtained when the system hamiltonian is time - dependent .",
    "actually , this difference between @xmath160 and @xmath125 makes the application of the sa more difficult than the time - independent case since the sa is based on the oscillating forms of @xmath166 and @xmath116 , as seen above eq .  .",
    "nevertheless , we can show that the sa is still possible ( see also appendix  [ sec : sa ] ) when @xmath167 are simultaneously satisfied .",

    "physically speaking , therefore , eq .",
    "means that @xmath98 and @xmath1 must remain unchanged until the beat oscillations of @xmath166 and @xmath116 are sufficiently developed .",

    "we can obtain @xmath172 with @xmath173 which is again formally the same as @xmath141 [ eq .  ] .",
    "thus , the dissipator can be described in the lindblad form .    finally , for practical use , it is better to transform back into the schrdinger picture . with the help of eq .  , eq .",

    "these markovian qmes are the direct generalizations of the standard markovian qmes for the time - independent hamiltonian .",
    "obviously , the obtained qmes recover the standard qmes if we assume @xmath106 .      in the previous section  [ subsec : iea ] ,",
    "we have derived the markovian qmes within the iea .",
    "however , we have to mention that the forms of the dissipators [ eqs .   and ]",
    "have already been known or expected from a long time ago  @xcite .",
    "this is _ not _ surprising because the derived dissipators can be obtained just by intuitively replacing the time - independent variables by the corresponding time - dependent ones .",
    "however , it has been believed that the applicable range is limited to the adiabatic - evolution regime that satisfies the ordinary adiabatic theorem .",
    "following the recent arguments in ref .  , for example , the evolution operator @xmath179 has been approximated by the ` ideal ' adiabatic - evolution operator @xmath180 [ eq .  ] to avoid the difficulty originating from the time convolution between @xmath99 and @xmath181 .",
    "however , such an approximation is _ not _ needed at all in the formulation shown above . in this sense",
    ", the applicable range is already extended beyond the adiabatic regime .",
    "this is our first important result .",
    "however , based on the formulation above , the iea is still limited to the time regime of @xmath48 satisfying @xmath182 .",
    "this means that @xmath1 should remain unchanged at least within @xmath2 to justify @xmath175 .",
    "nevertheless , in a broad range of situations , our claim of the validity is _ not _ restricted to just the regime of @xmath182 for the iea ; the @xmath175 is still well justified even if @xmath182 fails .    to show this result , we consider the time regime satisfying @xmath183 in this regime , @xmath1 is driven much more rapidly than the relaxation time scale .",
    "this means that @xmath175 [ the second term in eq .",
    "] has only a minor effect on the dynamics , compared to the hamiltonian dynamics [ the first term in eq .  ] .",
    "in such a situation , only a rough evaluation of the superoperator @xmath175 would be sufficient .",
    "in other words , the effect of the relaxation is negligible if we focus on the dynamics in the timescale of @xmath0 when @xmath184 .",
    "we can therefore state that the qme with @xmath175 [ eqs .   and ]",
    "strongly breaks down only when the iea is invalid [ @xmath185 , and simultaneously , the effect of the relaxation is non - negligible [ @xmath186 , namely , @xmath187 however , this condition can never be satisfied as long as the sufficient condition for the wca holds , as shown below .    for the wca , which is correct in the second order of @xmath81 , the fourth order contribution must sufficiently be small in comparison to the second order  @xcite because the third order contribution vanishes due to the assumption of eq .  . here",

    "the important point is that such a situation is generally guaranteed as long as we are in the weak coupling regime ; the dlz model corresponds to one prominent example .",
    "thus , the dlz model has been discussed to demonstrate the ability of the markovian qme in this section .",
    "finally , it would be worth digressing from the main subject to point out that the spontaneous emission ( the vacuum fluctuation ) has a great importance in the context of the aqc and the qa . in this case",

    "this fact indicates that the problem is non - trivial , while one may think it straightforward at first glance . in our view ,",

    "it would be worth noting that such an approach generally enables an easy estimation of whether the individual approximations are justified or not at a certain time @xmath48 .",
    "finally , a short digression has been made to discuss the importance of the spontaneous emission in the context of the aqc and the qa .",
    "we discussed the possibility that the spontaneous emission provides the self - healing mechanism that naturally corrects the computational errors .",
    "the results presented in this paper would be of interest to those who try to control quantum systems as a function of time  @xcite because in reality the quantum systems can not be free from uncontrolled interactions with environmental degrees of freedom ( bath ) .",
