    "quantum walks provide a quantum extension of the ubiquitous classical random walks and have important applications in a broad range of fields including solid - state physics , polymer chemistry , biology , astronomy , mathematics and computer science @xcite . due to their coherent nature , the behavior of quantum walks can differ significantly from that of the classical random walks , as corroborated by measures of mixing times , hitting times and exit probabilities of quantum walks @xcite .",
    "the continuous - time version of quantum walks ( continuous - time quantum walks , ctqws ) has been extensively studied as effective model of energy transport in molecular systems such as chromophoric light - harvesting complexes @xcite . in photosynthesis ,",
    "excitation energy is absorbed by pigments present in the antennas and subsequently transferred to a reaction center where an electron - transfer event initiates the process of biochemical energy conversion .",
    "this process has been studied for decades due to its impressive efficiency ( even over @xmath0 in certain bacterial systems and higher plants ) , nonetheless a full description of the mechanism leading to such a remarkable efficiency has not been achieved yet @xcite .",
    "also , the overall effect of the environment , of its ( quenched ) disorder and of the relative position of the reaction center are expected to play a central role @xcite . indeed , understanding how such a process works might be useful for the nano - engineering of optimized solar cells @xcite .",
    "the success rate of an energy transfer process can be investigated by studying the interaction between a quantum walk ( mimicking the rather coherent propagation of the exciton ) with a reaction center ( being it an impurity atom or molecule ) , which irreversibly traps the moving particle .",
    "consequently , a great deal of recent theoretical work has focused on investigating essential features of basic trapping models , wherein a quantum particle moves in a medium containing different arrangements of traps . the trapping problem on a one - dimensional structure has already been investigated in @xcite , where distinct configurations of traps ( ranging from periodical to random ) where shown to yield strongly different behaviors for the quantal mean survival probability , while classically , at long times , the exponential decay is always recovered . in this context the case of substrates displaying random topological inhomogeneity has not yet been investigated , notwithstanding their experimental importance @xcite .",
    "such random structures , typically modeled by erds - rny ( er ) graphs , have attracted a great deal of interest in the last years also due to new tools introduced for their investigation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we study the survival probability of a ctqw moving on an er graph in the presence of a fixed concentration of traps randomly placed .",
    "the number of traps @xmath1 as well as the substrate connectivity encoded by the average number of neighbors per node @xmath2 , are properly tuned in order to account for their role in affecting the trapping performance . indeed , since er networks lack hubs and display an overall homogeneous topology , the transport properties are controlled mainly by the average degree .",
    "hence , for a given realization of the system we measure the survival probability @xmath3 as a function of time @xmath4 , which , for sufficiently large systems , turns out to display a ( qualitatively ) robust behavior with respect to the realization of the system ; however , due to the intrinsic randomness of the system ( involving both the substrate topology and the trap arrangement ) in order to properly outline the typical behavior , we generated several realizations ( for given @xmath1 , @xmath2 and graph size @xmath5 ) , over which we averaged to get @xmath6 .",
    "analogous calculations have been performed for the case of a classical particle modeled by a continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) in order to figure out possible genuine quantum - mechanical effects .",
    "analysis are performed both numerically and analytically relying on matrix diagonalization algorithms and on perturbation theory , respectively .",
    "our results highlight that at long times and when the trap concentration is small , for large size ( @xmath7 ) and intermediate degrees of dilution ( @xmath8 ) , both quantal and classical survival probabilities typically decay exponentially with time .",
    "however , while the classical decay rate increases monotonically with @xmath2 , the quantal decay rate displays a subtler dependence .",
    "indeed , when the degree of dilution is either very large or very low , stationary states , not affected by traps , get more likely and this makes the quantal survival probability to decay to a finite value related to the number of localized eigenmodes . as a result , given a fixed number of randomly arranged traps , in order to enhance the trapping efficiency we need to thicken the substrate connectivity , independently of the current degree of dilution , while quantum mechanically",
    "the strategy does depend on the current degree of dilution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we define ctrw and ctqw and we describe the substrate where they move on ; then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we reports our results and finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we discuss them and possible extensions .",
    "the incoherent transport occurring over a discretizable environment can be modeled by continuous - time random walks ( ctrws ) described mathematically by a master equation . however , when dealing with quantum particles at low densities and low temperatures , decoherence can be suppressed to a large extent",
    ". therefore , the study of transport in this regime requires abandoning the classical , master - equation - type formalism and adopt a quantum - mechanical oriented picture , where the local description of the complex network of molecules involved in the transport can be retained through a tight - binding approach .",
    "interestingly , the ctrw picture can be mathematically reformulated to yield a quantum - mechanical hamiltonian of tight - binding type ; the procedure uses the mathematical analogies between time - evolution operators in statistical and in quantum mechanics : the result are continuous - time quantum walks ( ctqws ) .    in the following",
    "we provide the formal tools for the study of both ctrws and ctqws .",
    "let us consider a graph @xmath9 made up of @xmath5 nodes and algebraically described by the so - called adjacency matrix @xmath10 : the non - diagonal elements @xmath11 equal @xmath12 if nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 are connected by a bond and @xmath15 otherwise ; the diagonal elements @xmath16 are @xmath15 .",
    "we define the coordination number , or degree , of a node @xmath13 as @xmath17 .",
    "an erds - rnyi random graph is built as follows : starting with @xmath5 disconnected nodes , every pair , say @xmath13 and @xmath14 , is connected , namely @xmath18 , with probability @xmath19 , being @xmath20 ; multiple connections are forbidden and the extreme cases trivially correspond to a completely disconnected graph ( @xmath21 ) and to a fully connected graph ( @xmath22 ) . in the limit of large size @xmath5 , the coordination number of an arbitrary node follows a binomial distribution with average @xmath23 . due to their rigorous mathematical definition ,",
    "er graphs have been studied in details , from a topological point of view @xcite , as well as for what concerns the properties of statistical mechanics models defined on them ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the molloy - reed criterion for percolation @xcite shows that , in the limit @xmath24 a giant component exists , namely the graph is overpercolated , if and only if @xmath19 is larger than @xmath25 .",
    "now , the laplacian operator @xmath26 of an arbitrary graph @xmath9 is defined as @xmath27 , its spectrum , i.e. the set of all @xmath5 eigenvalues of @xmath26 , being denoted as @xmath28 ; it follows from gergorin s theorem @xcite that @xmath26 is positive semi - definite and , because its rows sum to @xmath15 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , is the row @xmath31-tuple each of whose entries is @xmath12 , therefore , the minimum eigenvalue is @xmath32 and it is afforded by @xmath30 .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of laplacian matrix @xmath26 ( also referred to as the admittance matrix , the stiffness matrix , or the kirchhoff matrix ) basically form the backbone of any discussion of dynamic behavior of the networks represented by our graphs ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the degeneracy of the null eigenvalue represents the number of disconnected components making up the whole graph ( in the following we will always consider connected graphs made up of one single component ) , while the second smallest eigenvalue , also called spectral gap , controls the synchronization time .",
    "moreover , the characterizations of eigenvectors are needed for a range of decentralized controls and dynamical - network analysis / design applications , including e.g. , network partitioning , synchronization design , and optimal network resource allocation . despite such need ,",
    "graph theoretic studies of the laplacian eigenvectors are sparse ( see @xcite for some reviews of these literature ) , and do not provide exact general characterizations of eigenvector - component values in terms of graph constructs for arbitrary graphs .    in the following",
    ", we will refer to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath26 as the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath9 .    to reveal the decay behavior of survival probabilities of the ctqw and ctrw we focus on systems of large size for which the spectral density of the laplacian spectrum follows wigner s law @xcite and converges to the semicircle distribution @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 . moreover , for highly diluted ( @xmath36 ) networks we can write @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "can be expressed as a function of @xmath2 only .",
    "continuous - time random walks ( ctrws ) @xcite are described by the following master equation : @xmath39 being @xmath40 the conditional probability that the walker at time @xmath4 is on node @xmath41 when it started from node @xmath14 at time @xmath15 . if the walk is unbiased the transmission rates @xmath42 are bond - independent and the transfer matrix @xmath43 is related to the laplacian operator through @xmath44 ( in the following we set @xmath45 ) .",
    "we now define the quantum - mechanical analog of the ctrw , i.e. the ctqw , by identifying the hamiltonian of the system with the classical transfer matrix , @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "hence , given the orthonormal basis set @xmath47 , representing the walker localized at the node @xmath14 , we can write @xmath48 where in the second term we sum over all connected couples @xmath49 . the operator @xmath50 is just the tight - binding hamiltonian which applies to a large class of quantum transport systems such as excitons and charges in molecular and quantum dots @xcite .",
    "now , the quantum mechanical time evolution operator is defined as @xmath51 $ ] , so that the transition amplitude @xmath52 from state @xmath53 at time @xmath15 to state @xmath54 at time @xmath4 reads @xmath55 , and it obeys the following schrdinger equation : @xmath56 formally very similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : master_cl ] .",
    "then , the classical and quantum transition probabilities to go from state @xmath53 to state @xmath54 in a time @xmath4 are given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .    in the absence of traps and other impurities ,",
    "the operators describing the dynamics of ctqws and of ctrws share the same set of eigenvalues and of eigenstates ; denoting with @xmath59 and @xmath60 $ ] the @xmath31th eigenvalue and orthonormal eigenvector of @xmath26 , we can write @xmath61 and @xmath62      let us introduce a set @xmath63 of @xmath1 traps placed randomly on nodes @xmath64 . in the incoherent ,",
    "classical transport case trapping is incorporated into the ctrw according to @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the unperturbed operator without traps while @xmath67 is the trapping operator defined as @xmath68 the capture strength @xmath69 determines the rate of decay for a particle located at trap site and here it is assumed to be equal for all traps .",
    "the transfer operator @xmath43 is therefore self - adjoint and negative definite ; we denote its eigenvalues by @xmath70 and the corresponding eigenstates by @xmath71 .",
    "the mean survival probability for the ctrw can be written as @xmath72 from eq .",
    "[ eq : p ] one may deduce that @xmath73 attains in general rather quickly an exponential form ; furthermore , if the smallest eigenvalue @xmath74 is well separated from the next closest eigenvalue , @xmath73 is dominated by @xmath74 and by the corresponding eigenstate @xmath75 @xcite : @xmath76    as for quantum transport , in the presence of substitutional traps the system can be described by the following effective ( but non - hermitian ) hamiltonian @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the unperturbed operator without traps .",
    "due to the non - hermiticity of @xmath50 , its eigenvalues are complex and can be written as @xmath79 ; moreover , the set of its left and right eigenvectors , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , can be chosen to be biorthonormal ( @xmath82 ) and to satisfy the completeness relation @xmath83 . therefore , according to eq .",
    "[ eq : schrodinger ] , the transition amplitude can be evaluated as @xmath84 from which @xmath85 follows .    of particular interest , due to its relation to experimental observables ,",
    "is the mean survival probability @xmath86 which can be expressed as @xcite @xmath87 the temporal decay of @xmath86 is determined by the imaginary parts of @xmath88 , i.e. by the @xmath89 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , at intermediate and long times and for @xmath90 , the @xmath86 can be approximated by a sum of exponentially decaying terms : @xmath91 and is dominated asymptotically by the smallest @xmath89 values .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the long - time decay of the survival probabilities @xmath73 and @xmath86 is controlled by the `` spectra '' @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively . when the capture strength is small ( @xmath94 ) , some insights into such spectra can be obtained following a perturbative approach to get the correction to the unperturbed eigenvalues .",
    "for instance , the first - order correction to @xmath95 , corresponding to the ( unperturbed ) eigenvector @xmath96 , reads as @xmath97 where , recalling that the graph is connected , we applied the perturbative theory for non - degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "let us first focus on the classical case . from eq .",
    "[ eq : first ] one can also write @xmath98 and , similarly , for the remaining eigenvalues @xmath99 . now , for large system size the smallest non - null eigenvalue @xmath100 can be estimated as @xmath101 ( see eq .  [ eq : wigner ] ) , which for large average degree @xmath2 , is well separated by @xmath102 , even if corrected by a term order of @xmath69 . therefore , in this case the survival probability is controlled by @xmath103 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the dilution gets lower the spectral gap also decreases and the smallest perturbed eigenvalue @xmath104 can get smaller than @xmath105 . of course , the lower @xmath2 and the smaller the expected @xmath104 , in such a way that the survival probability decreases with a smaller rate .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical calculations : as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : special ] the numerical data pertaining to a given realization of the substrate are well fitted by the function @xmath106 moreover the exponent @xmath107 gets lower when the link probability is drastically reduced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] ) .",
    "average classical and quantum survival probability as a function of time on a semilogarithmic scale - plot ; while @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are kept fixed , different values of @xmath19 are considered , that is , @xmath111 ( darker color for the quantal probability and @xmath112 , for the classical probability ) , @xmath113 ( intermediate color for the quantal probability and @xmath114 , for the classical probability ) , and @xmath115 ( brigheter color for the quantal probability and @xmath116 , for the classical probability ) .",
    "the dashed , clear line represents eq .",
    "[ eq : classic ] with @xmath117 and is in full agreement with numerical data . in the inset",
    "we show only @xmath118 on a semilogarithmic scale plot in order to highlight the exponential decay ; the dashed line represents the best fit with @xmath119 .",
    "these data refer to a particular realization of the substrate.,height=207 ]    the quantum - mechanical case is more subtle as in general the first eigenstate @xmath120 is not sufficient to determine the smallest perturbed eigenvalue of the complex spectrum .",
    "first of all , we notice that graphs displaying either high or low link dilution are more likely to present ( at least one ) laplacian eigenvector displaying a large number of null entries .",
    "this is easy to see by recalling , respectively , the `` edge principle '' @xcite and the fact that for a complete graph @xmath121 the eigenvectors show a monotonic trend in confinement , that is , as we go toward faster modes , the eigenvector is more localized and the region of support decreases by one node in the graph .",
    "another , intuitive , way to see this point is by noticing that the so - called faria vectors are more likely to be laplacian eigenvectors in the above mentioned regimes .",
    "indeed , we recall that , in the `` valuation notation '' @xcite , a faria vector @xmath122 is a vector with nonzero entries only on two vertices @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath123 ; moreover , a faria vector is an eigenvector of the laplacian of the graph @xmath9 if and only if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are twins , i.e. , if every vertex @xmath124 is either adjacent to both @xmath13 and @xmath14 or to neither one of them .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath125 if @xmath126 and @xmath127 if @xmath128 .",
    "now , the probability that such conditions are fulfilled can be written as @xmath129^{n-2-k}\\\\   = ( 1-p)^{2n-4 } + [ 1 - 2(1-p)p]^{n-2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is not negligible only in the region of very high and very low dilution and for relatively small sizes ; in particular , when @xmath19 scales like @xmath130 , being @xmath42 a finite value , from eq .  [",
    "eq : faria ] we get @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "hence , a faria vector is more likely to be an eigenvector as @xmath19 approaches either @xmath12 or @xmath15 , namely when there exists relative ( local ) homogeneity for the two nodes corresponding to the non - null entries .",
    "comparison between the mean average classical and quantum survival probability @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively , for a system made up of @xmath135 nodes in the presence of a random distribution of @xmath136 ( upper panel ) and @xmath137 ( lower panel ) traps .",
    "several degrees of dilutions are considered as shown in the legend , common for both panels .",
    "notice that curves corresponding to the classical case are overlapped .",
    "averages have been performed over @xmath138 different realizations.,height=264 ]    according to formula in eq .",
    "[ eq : first ] , the first - order correction is zero whenever the traps are positioned in any node other than the two twin sites ; analogously , one can verify that higher order corrections are null , indeed , such highly localized states do not see the traps at all .",
    "consequently , the average survival probability decays to a finite value , similarly to what evidenced in @xcite when deterministic and regular arrangements of traps were considered .",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath134 is given by the normalized number of stationary modes not intercepting the traps which , neglecting higher order terms , can be estimated by the number of disjoint faria twins @xmath139 times the probability that they are not occupied by traps , namely @xmath140 .",
    "the above picture is confirmed by numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : special ] , where the qualitative difference with respect to the classical case can also be noticed . on the other hand , for large sizes and intermediate degree of dilution , all the simulations performed recover the expected exponential decay at long times ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : pi_asym ] ) .",
    "indeed , numerical data can be properly fitted by the function @xmath141     ratio between the mean average classical and quantum survival probabilities @xmath133 and @xmath134 , pertaining to different degree of dilutions , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , for a system with @xmath144 and @xmath109 .",
    "we choose as reference value @xmath145 , while @xmath143 is taken either very small or comparable with the system size , as shown in the legend .",
    "notice that the case @xmath113 gives rise to relatively small survival probability in the quantal case , while classically it corresponds to an intermediate trapping efficiency in agreement with intuition.,height=377 ]    finally , we performed averages over several realizations of the underlying graph , so to get the mean average probabilities @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v40 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] ; in the latter figure we also plotted the ratios @xmath146 and @xmath147 . by fixing @xmath148 , hence corresponding to an intermediate dilution , and @xmath149 or @xmath150",
    ", we see that , classically , by reducing the dilution , the survival probability gets larger and vice versa , as expected . on the other hand , in the quantal case , both high and low dilution regimes prove to be less efficient in trapping the particles .",
    "the slow decay we highlighted for low- and high - connectivity networks is consistent with results found previously @xcite for the long time average @xmath151 of a ctqws embedded in er random graphs .",
    "it is worth recalling that @xmath151 is defined as @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the long time averaged transition probability which , classically , equals to the equal - partionend probability @xmath25 , while quantum - mechanically is given by @xmath154 now , @xmath151 is found to be larger than @xmath25 and to be almost a constant value in a wide range of average degree @xmath2 but increases slightly as @xmath19 approaches from above the percolation threshold and it increases fast when the network approaches a fully connected one where @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "otherwise stated , high ( and smaller ) connectivities correspond to a large degree of localization hence reducing the probability to get trapped .",
    "in this work we considered a continuous - time quantum walk ( ctqw ) propagating on erds - rnyi random graphs of size @xmath5 endowed with a tunable link probability @xmath19 , in such a way that the average coordination number is @xmath156 ; moreover , @xmath1 sites extracted randomly are occupied by traps .",
    "we measured the survival probability @xmath3 and we compared it to the analogous survival probability @xmath157 found for a classical continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) . as expected from analytical arguments ,",
    "when @xmath90 and the graph displays a relatively large size with intermediate degree of dilution , in the long - time regime both functions typically decay exponentially with time .",
    "however , when the dilution degree is either very low or very large , while @xmath157 still decays exponentially , @xmath3 can decay to a finite value due to the existence of localized eigenmodes not `` perceiving '' the traps ; of course , this effect gets less likely as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "we stress that the crossover evidenced in the behavior of @xmath158 for different regions of @xmath2 stems from a different degree of localization exhibited by the quantum walk . indeed , in networks with either large or very small mean degree",
    ", the quantum excitement is on average most likely to be found at the initial node @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the substrate topology allows the establishment of eigenstates supported by a restricted subset of nodes ; this is of course a quantum - mechanical effect : the classical particle quickly reaches an equipartition condition being equally spread on the whole substrate .    as a result , while the efficiency ( in terms of likelihood of trapping ) of classical transport is rather robust with respect to the degree of dilution but it can be substantially reduced by cutting links , for quantum transport , improving the efficiency by adding / removing links is more a subtle operation , as it sensitively depends on the starting topology .",
