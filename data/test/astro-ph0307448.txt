    "despite considerable progress obtained over the last century , astrophysicists are still far away from a thorough understanding on how magnetic fields are produced in the sun and other cool active stars ; the picture gets even worse when it comes to explain quantitatively how these fields generate the plethora of active phenomena observed both at their surface ( e.g.  dark spots ) and in their immediate surrounding ( e.g.  corona , wind ) . particularly interesting in this respect is the case of fully convective stars for which conventional dynamo processes ( supposed to concentrate mostly in the interface layer between the radiative interior and the convective envelope , i.e.  the only place where the field can be stored for a time comparable to the period of the activity cycle ) can not be invoked to justify , not only the presence of a large - scale magnetic field ( e.g.  johns - krull & valenti 1996 ) , but also their very intense activity level .",
    "the most recent observational results in this field , consisting of temporal series of magnetic maps obtained by indirect tomographic imaging from sets of rotationally modulated spectropolarimetric data ( donati et al .",
    "1992 ; donati & cameron 1997 ; donati 1999 ; donati et al .  1999 ; donati et al .  2003 ; petit et al .  2003a , 2003b ) , are particularly intriguing and thus potentially very fruitful for providing new clues to what may be happening in the convective layers of these stars .",
    "all reconstructed magnetic maps to date indeed show the presence of large magnetic regions in the stellar photosphere where the field is mostly azimuthal ( i.e.  parallel to the surface and oriented along parallels ) ; moreover , these regions are often observed to form partial , or even complete , rings of azimuthal field encircling the star at various latitudes , and are thus interpreted as the direct detection , at photospheric level , of the quasi - axisymmetric toroidal component of the large - scale dynamo field .",
    "these results suggest in particular that dynamos operating in very active stars are likely to be significantly different than that of the sun .",
    "the observations indeed reveal that such dynamos are able to produce large scale field ( and especially toroidal field ) very close to the surface ( since we would not observe toroidal field in the photosphere otherwise ) , and presumably even throughout the whole convective zone ; dynamo processes in these stars are therefore likely distributed within the convective envelope , rather than being confined at its base as in the sun .",
    "this conclusion raises however a number of subsequent , and yet unresolved , problems ; we can no longer understand , for instance , how the magnetic field can be stored within the convective zone for periods of time as long as decades . at the same time",
    ", it may provide new insight for a number of long standing mysteries , and in particular for our comprehension on how dynamos operate in fully convective stars .",
    "one of these mysteries concerns the long - term fluctuations observed in the orbital period of close binary stars in which one member is at least a cool active star ( e.g.  hall 1990 ) , and occurring on a time scale of a few decades , i.e.  much shorter than what would be required for tidal coupling between system components to operate ( zahn 1989 ) .",
    "the least unreasonable interpretation for this phenomenon remains that proposed by applegate ( 1992 ) ; he suggests that dynamo processes at work in one star of the binary system activate a periodic exchange between magnetic and kinetic energy within the convective zone of this star , and thus a cyclic fluctuation of its quadrupolar moment as well as of its gravitational field .",
    "given the amplitude of the observed fluctuations in orbital period , one can easily infer that such magnetic to kinetic energy exchanges specific to dynamo processes must occur throughout the whole convective zone and not only within a thin layer ( lanza et al .",
    "1998 ; donati 1999 ) , i.e.  that dynamo processes in these stars should indeed be distributed .",
    "if applegate s ( 1992 ) idea is true , it therefore implies that very active stars such as those found in close binary stars , but also young single stars that did not dissipate most of their angular momentum yet and still exhibit very energetic active phenomena , should feature a convective zone that globally undergoes such periodic exchanges between magnetic and kinetic energy .",
    "it means in particular that the internal velocity field within the convective zone of very active stars , and therefore both their radial and surface differential rotation profiles , should vary with time in a way correlated to the magnetic cycle . detecting such variations in the differential rotation of active stars",
    "thus appears as a very interesting observational challenge , as it would provide a definite confirmation of both applegate s ( 1992 ) mechanism and of the existence of distributed dynamos .",
    "it would also bring into a much wider astrophysical context the recent discovery that the solar angular rotation at the base of the convective zone is undergoing temporal fluctuations ( howe et al .",
    "2000 ) as a probable consequence of the activity cycle .    measuring surface differential rotation of very active stars is however a rather tricky task ; detecting changes of this differential rotation is even more difficult .",
    "several methods have been proposed to estimate surface differential rotation .",
    "some of them try to make use of the subtle changes that differential rotation induce in the profile of spectral lines ( brunning 1981 ; reiners & schmitt 2002 ) ; this method can however not be used for the stars we are interested in , the spectral lines of which being heavily distorted by the presence of cool spots at their surfaces .",
    "other methods ( e.g.  donati & cameron 1997 ) propose to take advantage of these surface features , and use them as tracers to derive some information on how their rotation periods depend on latitude .",
    "the most recent of such techniques , that of cameron et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , succeeded , not only in estimating surface differential rotation of one active star , but also in suggesting that temporal changes in the amount of differential rotation were indeed occurring in this star ( cameron & donati 2002 ) .    in this paper , we propose to make use of yet another technique , first proposed by donati et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to estimate the differential rotation of a young pre - main - sequence star , then by petit et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003a , b ) both for simulation purposes and application to spectropolarimetric data .",
    "the aim of this paper is to apply this method to the extensive spectropolarimetric data set that we collected in the last seven yr for three stars , namely the young ultra - fast rotator ab  doradus , the young k0 star lq  hydrae and the k1 subgiant of the rs  cvn system hr  1099 , and from which yearly brightness and magnetic maps were obtained and published in the literature ( donati & cameron 1997 ; donati 1999 ; donati et al .  1999 , 2003 ) .",
    "in sect .  [ sect : modelling ] , we recall the main aspects of both observational material and modelling tool , then describe its application to the three selected stars in sect .  [",
    "sect : diffrot ] ; after discussing at length the implication of our results for the understanding of the global dynamics of convective zones of cool stars ( in sect .  [",
    "sect : discussion ] ) , we finally conclude and propose in sect .  [",
    "sect : conclusion ] a few directions in which this work could be fruitfully extended .",
    "the data we use are the spectropolarimetric observations collected at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) with a visitor polarimeter mounted at cassegrain focus and fibre linked to the high resolution ucl echelle spectrograph ( ucles ) .",
    "this material , and in particular the observing logs , the observing procedures and the data reduction details , are described extensively in a series of published papers that present the results obtained up to now ( donati et al .",
    "1997 ; donati & cameron 1997 ; donati 1999 ; donati et al .  1999 , 2003 ) .",
    "the data we use in this paper are all observations of ab  dor , lq  hya and hr  1099 collected since epoch 1995.9 , i.e.  obtained in a similar spectrograph configuration .",
    "this makes a maximum amount of 7 data sets ( corresponding to epochs 1995.94 , 1996.99 , 1998.03 , 1999.00 , 1999.97 , 2000.93 and 2001.99 ) for each of the three stars ; we however anticipate that several of them ( and in particular those with very few data or collected over a timespan of no more than a few days , e.g.  those at epoch 1999.97 ) will be unusable for our purpose , according to the conclusions of petit et al .",
    "note that all data were reprocessed with the newest version of the reduction software ( donati et al .",
    "2003 ) to ensure the highest possible internal accuracy in radial velocity as well as the best level of homogeneity .",
    "all data were run through least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ) , a multiline tool developed by donati et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found to extract successfully the average rotationally broadened shape of unpolarised or circularly polarised lines ( called stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 lsd profiles in the following ) at each observed phase of the stellar rotational cycle , from the thousands of moderate to strong spectral features present in the recorded wavelength domain .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the method we chose to estimate surface differential rotation for the selected stars is that introduced by donati et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the validity of which was confirmed through an extensive sets of simulations by petit et al .",
    "recently , petit et al .  ( 2003a ,",
    "b ) applied it successfully to large data sets collected over several years on a different telescope and with a different ( though similar ) instrumentation for two different stars , one of them being our third object of interest ( the k1 subgiant of hr  1099 ) and the other a giant star of fk  com type ( hd  199178 ) .",
    "this method consists in assuming a given surface differential rotation law ( that we implement in our indirect stellar surface imaging code ) and producing brightness or magnetic images of the stellar surface from all unpolarised or circularly polarised data available for this star at a given season ; we then take as most probable the differential rotation law that generates the images with lowest information content ( given a certain data fit accuracy ) , or equivalently the images that provide the best fit to the data ( given a certain image information content ) . in practice ,",
    "both options yield very similar results ; the second one happens to be more convenient as it provides an easy way of estimating error bars on the differential rotation parameters ( see petit et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the stellar surface imaging code that we use is that of brown et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and donati & brown ( 1997 ) , applied quite extensively to real data in the last decade ( the latest examples being donati et al .",
    "2003 and petit et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "it includes in particular the possibility of reconstructing images of stars that are differentially rotating , i.e.  of taking into account explicitly the differential rotation pattern in the imaging process .",
    "the surface differential rotation law we assume in this paper is given by the following equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the rotation rate at colatitude @xmath4 ,  the rotation rate of the equator and  the difference in rotation rate between the pole and equator .",
    "at each season , one brightness and one magnetic image is produced from the full stokes @xmath0 and stokes @xmath1 data sets respectively , for each selected pair of differential rotation parameters within a reasonable search domain of the   plane .",
    "this typically means that we have to compute a few hundred brightness and magnetic images for each star at each season , which therefore requires large amount of computing time ; for instance , in the particular case of the stokes @xmath0 data set of ab  dor at epoch 2001.99 where as much as 27,400 data points must be fitted simultaneously , we typically need a few days of computing time on the fastest available workstations to derive how the reduced  of the fit to the data varies with the differential rotation parameters at a good enough resolution .",
    "a typical example of the reduced  maps we obtain from stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : csqmaps ] .",
    "it could be argued that , in the sake of computing time , we could actually derive the optimal differential rotation parameters as part of the imaging process itself , since this would mean no more than fitting another two parameters in addition to the thousands of image pixels we already have to deal with .",
    "however , our experience is that the  maps we obtain are not always as nice as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : csqmaps ] , and sometimes do not feature any physically meaningful minimum .",
    "we therefore preferred to keep our initial procedure , and check in each case whether the obtained reduced   maps showed a clear enough minimum to be able to claim safely that differential rotation is indeed detected at the corresponding epoch .",
    "another very important advantage of producing reduced  maps is that they can also be used in a very straightforward way to obtain error bars on our estimates of the differential rotation parameters .",
    "following press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , we indeed know that the 1  @xmath5 confidence interval for each differential rotation parameter taken separately can be obtained by searching for all points of the   plane for which the  increase ( with respect to the minimum value in the map ) is smaller than 1 to [ fig : hrdriv ] , which includes all points of the map for which the  increase is smaller than 2.3 ] ( or equivalently for which the reduced  increase is smaller than @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of fitted data points ) , and projecting this ellipsoid onto the  and  axes respectively . the simplest way to evaluate these projections ( and thus the formal error bars for each parameter ) is to compute the curvature radii of the  paraboloid at its minimum and the correlation coefficient between the two parameters ; for a  paraboloid with linear and quadratic terms given by @xmath8 , the value of the optimal parameters and the associated error bars simply write : @xmath9 @xmath10    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : param ]    the conservation of angular momentum within the convective zone therefore implies , in our first test case , the following relation between  and : @xmath11  being a constant , equal to the rotation rate the stellar convective zone would have if spinning as a solid body . in our second test case , this relation becomes : @xmath12 implying in particular that the linear relationship between   and  is significantly less steep than in our first test case ( see table  [ tab : param ] ) .",
    "it may be worthwhile to note that , although   and  refer specifically to the differential rotation parameters at the surface of the star , eq .",
    "[ eq : rela ] still holds when replacing  and  by their equivalents estimated at radial distance @xmath13 from the centre of the star ( and noted respectively @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) since both do not show any dependence with @xmath13 in this particular case ; however , this is not true in the second test case , where eq .",
    "[ eq : relb ] becomes , when expressed as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is equal to @xmath18 with @xmath19 denoting the squared fractional radius @xmath20 . in our second test case",
    ", we therefore expect the relationship between @xmath15 and @xmath14 to change ( turning steeper with decreasing @xmath13 ) depending on the depth at which the tracers used to estimate differential rotation are anchored .",
    "we can also derive by the same method an expression giving the kinetic energy @xmath21 within the convective zone . the general formula , writing : @xmath22 becomes , in our first test case : @xmath23\\ ] ] and in the second test case : @xmath24\\ ] ] where @xmath25 stands for : @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the sixth order moment of the fractional radius @xmath28 . in both cases",
    ", we obtain that @xmath21 can be written as the sum of two terms , one that we know is constant ( given eqs .",
    "[ eq : rela ] and [ eq : relb ] , reflecting the conservation of angular momentum ) and a second , potentially variable , one , directly proportional to @xmath29 . to compute the actual variation in kinetic energy @xmath30",
    ", one must note that  can itself be written as the sum of two terms : @xmath31 where  and  respectively represent the minimum value of the observed photospheric shear ( that corresponding to the state closest to solid body rotation ) and the variable contribution to . in this context , the variation of kinetic energy induced by the differential rotation changes writes : @xmath32 ( @xmath25 being replaced by 8/175 in our first test case )",
    ".    it could be tempting to consider that the whole variation in kinetic energy is transformed into magnetic energy as part of the magnetic cycle ( as proposed by lanza et al .",
    "however , this conclusion first requires that we obtain an expression similar to that derived above for @xmath30 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dk ] ) , but for the associated changes in potential energy that result from the fluctuations in the internal angular velocity field and thus to the variations in the shape of the star .",
    "we could then derive which fraction of the kinetic plus potential energy is converted into magnetic energy during the activity cycle .",
    "similarly , we could also obtain estimates of the fluctuations in the in the stellar quadrupole moment ( as done for instance by applegate 1992 ) , but in the specific context of our study ( i.e.  with the internal velocity fields assumed above in eqs .",
    "[ eq : drsun ] and [ eq : drufr ] ) .",
    "we however keep this out of this initial study and postpone it for future papers ; it is nevertheless rather safe to claim that the amount of kinetic energy transformed into magnetic energy is of the same magnitude as ( though not strictly equal to ) @xmath30 .      if we now compare the model predictions obtained in sect .",
    "[ sect : momentum ] with our observations , we straightforwardly obtain that the second test case ( featuring constant angular velocity along cylinders within the convective zone ) seems much more appropriate .",
    "it is indeed only in this case that different depths in the convective zone correspond to different angular shears ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : drsun ] and [ eq : drufr ] ) , thus providing a natural explanation of the discrepancy between the  and  estimates derived from stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 data .",
    "if this is indeed the correct interpretation , it would imply that magnetic features , showing the strongest shear , are in general anchored closer to the surface ( where @xmath15 is maximum ) than cool spots .",
    "this is at least in qualitative agreement with the conclusions of , e.g. , donati et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , claiming that magnetic features ( and in particular those hosting predominantly azimuthal fields ) must be formed very close to the surface in these stars .",
    "further support about the idea that dynamo magnetic fields ( and in particular their toroidal components ) can be produced very close to the stellar surface comes from the recent discovery that the sun features a subphotospheric layer with a strong radial gradient in angular rotation ( corbart & thompson 2002 ) that seems at least able to trigger dynamo action ( dikpati et al .  2002 ) .    however , there is already a number of potential problems with this simple description .",
    "it implies for instance that the range of possible latitudinal shears we should observe on a given star at a given epoch goes from  at the surface , down to @xmath33 at the bottom of the convective zone , i.e.  that the maximum ratio between the shears we measure from stokes @xmath1 and stokes @xmath0 data should be @xmath34 .",
    "although this is verified for ab  dor ( for which the measured ratio varies from 1.25 to 1.8 and thus remains always smaller than the maximum predicted value of @xmath35 ) , the situation is different for lq  hya where we observe ( at epoch 2001.99 ) differential rotation shears in stokes @xmath1 and stokes @xmath0 that differ by a factor of about 6 ( see table  [ tab : lqhya ] ) , much larger than the theoretical maximum of 1.9 .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is not clear yet ; the fact that only one point ( out of the seven for which measurements from stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 data are available ) exhibits this problem tells at least that the model we propose , although probably oversimplified , is not necessarily a complete nonsense .",
    "one possibility is that the model we consider does not take into account the additional shears that probably exist in the interface layer between the convective envelope and the radiative interior , nor that associated with a potential subsurface shear similar to that of the sun ( corbard & thompson 2002 ) ; we may thus imagine that , in some rare cases , the bulk of the differential rotation tracers we use is anchored in these thin shear layers , producing a small number of observations in disagreement with our simple picture .",
    "it may also indicate that the differential rotation estimate secured for lq  hya at epoch 2001.99 from stokes @xmath0 data is affected by some spurious contribution that we have not yet identified ( values derived from stokes @xmath1 data being always more reliable and less prone to systematic effects ) ; although we are of course fully aware that is a rather unsatisfying and potentially worrying statement , we can not yet rule out this possibility completely until a larger sample of estimates are available for us to check if this problem is truly an exception or rather a regular occurence . in the rest of the study , we exclude this point from the analysis and further investigate how compatible is the toy model we propose with the rest of our data .",
    "a quantitative test consists in measuring the slope of the  versus  relations that we obtain for each star by taking into account all estimates derived in sect .",
    "[ sect : diffrot ] ( and shown on figs .",
    "[ fig : abdriv ] to [ fig : hrdriv ] ) and comparing it to those the model predict ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : rela ] to [ eq : relc ] ) . to determine the optimal linear relationship that provides the best fit through all data points and their associated confidence ellipses for each star ( something that a conventional least - squares fit , not taking into account the correlated errors on both axes , can not properly achieve )",
    ", we iteratively consider a large number of such relationships ( i.e.  a large number of @xmath36 and  pairs ) and compute , for each of them , the closest approach ( in terms of ) to all error ellipses and the associated overall goodness of fit ( defined as the sum of the minimum square distances to each ellipse ) . from these values , we derive a  map ( in the @xmath37 plane ) , look for a minimum and fit the map by a bi - dimensional paraboloid in the neighbourhood of this minimum ( by a method similar to that described in sect .",
    "[ sect : modelling ] ) to obtain both the optimum values of @xmath36 and  as well as the corresponding error bars .    for ab  dor and using all the estimates listed in table  [ tab : abdor ] ( 10 points altogether with their associated error ellipses ) ,",
    "we obtain from this procedure that the minimum achievable reduced  is 10.5 , already indicating that the model provides a rather poor explanation of our observations .",
    "when 2 ( out of the 10 available ) differential rotation estimates are removed from the full sample ( those obtained from stokes @xmath0 data at epoch 1995.94 and from stokes @xmath1 data at epoch 2001.99 ) on the reason that they deviate most from the fit including all points ( at a level of about 5  @xmath5 ) , the minimum achievable reduced  decreases to a smaller , but still uncomfortably high , value of 4.8 , yielding values of @xmath36 and  equal to @xmath38 and @xmath39   respectively ( with 1  @xmath5 error bars enhanced by a factor of @xmath40 to reflect the poor fit obtained with this model ) .",
    "note that the value of @xmath36 we derive agrees well with that predicted for the second test model ( equal to 0.52 , see table  [ tab : abdor ] ) .",
    "if we now impose @xmath36 to be equal to 0.2 ( the value predicted for our first test model ) , the minimum reduced  that we can now achieve is about 2.6 times larger than that obtained without constraining @xmath36 .",
    "this strongly suggests that our first model ( assuming solar - like differential rotation within the convective zone ) is a much less probable option than the second one ( assuming constant angular velocity along cylinders within the convective zone ) , event hough the accuracy to which the observations are fitted with this second model is still not satisfactory .    to investigate whether the agreement with the data can be improved",
    ", the best way is to attempt exploiting all built - in characteristics of our simple model , for instance by taking explicitly into account , when comparing with the data , the fact that the different types of tracers may be anchored at different convective depths . to achieve this , we proceed along the lines presented in sect .  [",
    "sect : momentum ] and try to measure the differential rotation estimates corresponding to stokes @xmath0 and stokes @xmath1 data with different linear relationships ( using eqs .",
    "[ eq : relc ] and [ eq : lambdap ] ) .",
    "more specifically , we proceed as explained in the paragraphs above , except that we now have three independent parameters , @xmath36 ( the slope of the  versus   relationship in the stokes @xmath1 data , presumably referring to the surface layers ) , @xmath41 ( the slope of this relationship in the stokes @xmath0 data , presumably referring to deeper convective layers ) and one value of .",
    "the only difference from the previous procedure is that we now fit a three dimensional ( instead of a two dimensional ) paraboloid to the   map .",
    "this new modelling attempt ( with the same two data points excluded ) yields a minimum reduced  of 3.2 , along with values of @xmath36 , @xmath41 and  respectively equal to @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44  ( error bars being again scaled up in proportion to the square root of the reduced ) .",
    "although the fit to the data is now more satisfactory and the derived value of @xmath41 falls within the expected range ( between 0.13 and 0.40 , given the inverse squared fractional anchoring depths @xmath45 obtained from ratioing the estimated shears at each epoch , see above ) , the value of @xmath36 we extract is poorly compatible with that we expect for the surface layers ( equal to 0.52 ) , with a mismatch of about 3  @xmath5 . repeating the procedure with @xmath36 being fixed to the expected value of 0.5 yields no improvement in the accuracy level to which the data are fitted with respect to the two parameter fit described above .",
    "we therefore conclude that the estimates of differential rotation and of its temporal variations at the surface of ab  dor suggest that the distribution of angular velocities within the convective zone is closer to that we expect for rapid rotators than to that of the sun .",
    "however , the simple model we propose , in addition to the fact that the accuracy level to which it fits the data is only rough , also predicts some features that are not reproduced in the observations , and in particular the different slopes of the linear  versus  relationships expected for tracers anchored at different convective depths .",
    "what it may simply indicate is that our test models are still far too simple to match the observations at that level of detail .",
    "further attempts , with more realistic large scale angular velocity fields in the convective zone will be the subject of forthcoming papers .",
    "the first part of this experiment can also be applied to our lq  hya data . using the two parameter fitting procedure described above through the available measurements ( 4 points with associated error ellipses , once discarded the estimate from stokes @xmath0 data obtained at epoch 2001.99 , see above ) , we obtain values of @xmath36 and  that are respectively equal to @xmath46 and @xmath47  and provide a nice fit to the data , with an associated reduced  level of 0.84 . for this star",
    "again , we obtain that the slope of the observed versus  linear relationship is not compatible with a solar like differential rotation within the convective zone ; repeating the same procedure with @xmath36 fixed to 0.2 ( as required by our first test model ) increases the minimum reduced  up to 7.2 , i.e.  8.4 times that achieved with the unconstrained fit . assuming now constant angular velocity along cylinders , the model would then require the tracers to be anchored at about mid depth within the convective zone ( at a fractional radius of about 0.86 ) to agree with the observations .",
    "another possibility is of course that the internal velocity field of lq  hya is somehow intermediate between that of a very fast rotator like ab  dor and that of a slow rotator like the sun , reflecting the fact that the rotation rate of lq  hya ( 3.9  ) is bracketed by that of ab  dor ( 12.2  d ) and that of the sun ( 0.25  ) . in this context ,",
    "contours of constant angular rotation within the convective zone should start deviating from being aligned with the rotation axis , and get slightly tilted towards the radial direction . once again , we caution that these conclusions are still highly speculative and require more observational material ( in particular measurements on other stars rotating slower and faster than lq  hya ) to be settled more firmly .    carrying out a similar investigation in the particular case of hr  1099",
    "would also be very interesting , as our second model predicts a significantly higher slope for the  versus  linear relation ( equal to about 0.68 , see table  [ tab : param ] ) due to the fact that the convective zone ( pertaining more than 99% of the total stellar volume ) is much deeper in this star",
    ". the smaller rotation rate of hr  1099 ( 2.2  ) may also act at the same time to decrease the value of @xmath36 with respect to the predicted one .",
    "since no temporal variations of differential rotation are however yet detected on hr  1099 , all this remains essentially a matter of speculation , until more accurate estimates ( such as those of petit et al .",
    "2002 , but covering a longer time span ) are available .",
    "another important aspect of this problem concerns the amount of kinetic energy that the star either withdraws from or releases into the total energy reservoir of the convective zone when switching from one state of differential rotation to another .",
    "in particular , we should make sure that the total power associated with the energy transfer from or into kinetic energy is significantly smaller , or at the very least not larger , than the stellar luminosity itself , to ensure that the process we invoke to explain our observations ( which in principle should apply to the vast majority of rapidly rotating cool stars ) does not implicitly require at the same time that the star looses its energy at a very fast rate .",
    "of course , we reckon that the energy transfers we invoke likely correspond to some redistribution process between the various reservoirs in which the convective zone can store energy ( i.e.  kinetic , potential and magnetic energy wells ) ; however , we suspect that these transfers are inevitably associated with some energy dissipation , i.e.  that a significant fraction ( the exact proportion being poorly known ) of the energy transfered is lost ( and thus radiated ) in the process .    the changes in kinetic energy associated with the differential rotation fluctuations can easily be estimated from eq .",
    "[ eq : dk ] . in the case of ab",
    "dor , the results reported in sect .",
    "[ sect : abdor ] suggest that   and  are respectively equal to 60 and 40  , implying that @xmath30 should be equal to @xmath48 or about @xmath49  erg . assuming this transfer occurs progressively over a typical timespan of a few years ( @xmath50  s )",
    ", we obtain that the power required to operate the change we invoke corresponds to about 1% of the total stellar luminosity .",
    "( note that @xmath30 is only weakly dependent on the assumed internal velocity field , varying only by a factor of about two between our two test models ) .",
    "for lq  hya , our observations indicate that  is probably close to zero while  gets as large as 200  , implying that @xmath30 should now be equal to @xmath51 or about @xmath52  erg .",
    "if we again consider that the corresponding evolution occurs on a time scale of a few years , we find that the associated power corresponds to 10% of the total stellar luminosity .",
    "although this sounds rather large already , one must keep in mind that only a small fraction of this amount is actually lost ( i.e.   radiated ) in the process ; it suggests that , even in the case of the star that exhibits the most drastic effect ( i.e.  lq  hya ) , the corresponding power dissipated in the process does probably not exceed 1% of the stellar luminosity . since no temporal changes were detected in the case of hr  1099 , we thus can not obtain a similar estimate without any ( hopefully reasonable ) assumption on  and .",
    "taking @xmath53 and @xmath54   as a guess ( and to remain grossly compatible with the differential rotation changes that the orbital period fluctuations observed on this system request , donati 1999 ) , we obtain that @xmath30 reaches as much as @xmath55  erg and that the associated power required to drive this change corresponds to about 3% of the stellar luminosity ( provided the change in  occurs over a few years ) .",
    "if we finally assume that most of the changes in kinetic energy associated with the fluctuations in differential rotation are associated with equal ( and opposite ) variations in magnetic energy occurring throughout the whole convective zone , we can obtain a very rough estimate of the average magnetic field strength required to drive these changes .",
    "we caution that this estimate is necessarily very rough for at least several reasons .",
    "the first reason is of course that the magnetic field is expected to be very intermittent throughout the convective zone and to exhibit a strong gradient in the radial direction ( comparable to the one that the gas pressure undergoes ) , implying that an average magnetic field strength over the whole convective volume is not extremely meaningful ; the second reason ( already mentioned above ) is that fluctuations in potential energy are also expected to occur ( as a consequence of the changes in the shape of the star ) and probably participate as well in the total energy budget .",
    "however , a rough estimate being better than no estimate , we decided to mention in the paper the derived average magnetic strengths , to at least convince the readers that the magnitude of these fields is physically plausible . for ab",
    "dor and lq  hya , we obtain magnetic intensities of 9 and 23  kg respectively ; using the above guesses in the case of hr  1099 yields a field strength of 5  kg .",
    "this is clearly larger that the magnetic strengths estimated at the surface ( e.g.  donati 1999 ; donati et al .",
    "2003 ) , and reflects the strong radial gradient of field strength ( pointing inwards ) that probably exists within the convective zone .",
    "this paper reports positive detections of surface differential rotation on two rapidly rotating cool stars at several epochs , by using stellar surface features ( both cool spots and magnetic regions ) as tracers of the large scale latitudinal shear that distorts the convective envelope in this type of stars .",
    "we also report definite evidence that this differential rotation is different when estimated from cool spots or magnetic regions , and that it undergoes temporal fluctuations of potentially large amplitude on a time scale of a few years .",
    "we consider these results as further evidence that the dynamo processes operating in these stars are distributed throughout the convective zone rather than being confined at its base as in the sun . with the help of two very simple models of the angular velocity field within the convective zone ( one that resembles that of the sun and one supposed to represent that of ultra fast rotators ) , we explore the quantitative implications that angular momentum conservation within the convective zone imposes on potential variations of surface differential rotation with time .",
    "this modelling suggests , from comparison with our observations , that the rotation velocity field within the convective zone of the stars we investigated is not like that of the sun , and may resemble that we expect for rapid rotators , with constant angular velocity along cylinders aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "the power required to drive the observed changes in the differential rotation of the convective zone are estimated to be of the order of 1 to 10% of the total stellar luminosity ; we speculate that these changes result from the dynamo processes ( and from the underlying magnetic cycle ) that periodically converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy and vice versa .    the technique outlined in this paper corresponds to the first practical method for investigating the large scale rotation velocity field in convective zones of cool active stars .",
    "in particular , we note that it can already provide us with more information than what one could obtain with other existing techniques such as asteroseismology ( expected to yield rather poor resolution on the internal rotation profile in the radial direction , even when operated from space , at least in the next decade ) .",
    "we therefore strongly argue in favour of renewing the experiment reported here , in order to explore more extensively the full capabilities of this new method",
    ". monitoring continuously the same star for time spans as long as several months every year for several years would be especially interesting if one wants to disclose short term chaotic variability ( presumably due to the natural randomness inherent to turbulence and differential rotation ) from the long term supposedly periodic evolution driven by the magnetic cycle .    in this context ,",
    "the new spectropolarimeter espadons , designed for maximum efficiency and being built for the 3.6  m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( commissioning scheduled for spring 2003 ) , represents the optimal instrumental facility for carrying the observations that this new method requires .",
    "we expect in particular that the large gain in sensitivity that this new tool will provide over older generation instruments should give us the opportunity of both extending the available data set to a much larger sample of stars and studying the physical processes of interest to us in much more details .",
    "this research program will also strongly benefit from having similar instruments on smaller telescopes to allow the long , repeated and if possible multisite , observational campaigns that are necessary for optimising the performances of the investigation we suggest . in this respect ,",
    "the 2  m bernard lyot telescope atop pic du midi in france , that will soon be equipped with narval ( a carbon copy of espadons , whose construction just started ) and dedicated to spectropolarimetric studies , should be extremely useful for this kind of research .",
    "we warmly thank corinne charbonnel for kindly providing us with some models of the internal structure of the three stars on which this study is focused .",
    "we are also grateful to the referee , rob jefferies , for making very detailed and relevant comments that allowed us to improve the paper substantially ."
