    "the detection of the heart disease is very important .",
    "one of the measurements used for checking the condition of the heart is the electrocardiogram ( ecg ) signal .",
    "the components of each ecg beat consist of the p wave , the qsr complex , and the s wave .",
    "however , the manual analysis of ecg signal is tedious and time consuming . therefore , a computer - assisted system for analyzing ecg signals has been developed to solve these problems .",
    "the detection algorithm for r peak in the qrs complex is a preliminary step in the computer - assisted system to other ecg signal analysis such as arrhythmia analysis @xcite , and heart rate variability ( hrv ) analysis @xcite .",
    "the algorithm for detecting r peak in the qrs complex is generally divided into three main steps , i.e. noise removal , envelope signal determination , and r peak detection . in noise removal step ,",
    "a variety of noises in the ecg signal , such as the muscle noise , the power line noise , and the baseline drift noise are removed .",
    "one of the most popular methods used for noise removal in the ecg signal is the wavelet transform technique including continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) @xcite , discrete wavelet transform @xcite , and wavelet package decomposition @xcite . after noise removal",
    ", the envelope signal is obtained from the ecg signal after noise removal and the threshold is defined to determine the time period where the r peak in qrs complex locates .",
    "generally , there are four types of thresholding techniques , i.e. , a single level fixed threshold @xcite , multiple levels fixed threshold @xcite , a single level adaptive threshold @xcite , and multiple levels adaptive threshold .",
    "the r peak can be detected from the time position where the amplitude of the ecg signal after noise removal is maximal .",
    "generally , more complicated threshold techniques such as multiple levels fixed threshold and the single level adaptive threshold are used because the ecg signals after noise removal from different beat types , such as normal beat and premature ventricular contraction beat , have significant difference in their amplitudes due to their difference in frequency components .",
    "all wavelet functions in previous publications were selected based on their efficiency in removing noise .",
    "however , their effects on qrs signal to noise ratio and the detection accuracy are not yet considered .",
    "therefore , the proposed comparison measurements of the wavelet function in cwt are presented in this paper to demonstrate both qrs signal to noise ratio enhancement and detection accuracy so that the reduction in the computational complexity of the algorithm in the r peak detection step can be obtained .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the cwt theory .",
    "section 3 describes the qrs detection algorithm , the performance measures for the selection of wavelet functions , as well as the measures for detection accuracy .",
    "results and discussion are given in section 4 .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "the cwt has been gained popular uses for decomposing signals in many applications including noise removal in ecg signals . given the input signal @xmath0 , which is the ecg signal in this paper , the cwt of @xmath0 can be expressed as    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the cwt of @xmath0 , @xmath3 is the dilation or scale parameter , @xmath4 is the location parameter , and @xmath5 is the complex conjugate of the wavelet function .",
    "the scale and the wavelet function are two important parameters affecting the performance of noise removal in ecg signals .",
