    "atoms and molecules find wide applications in fundamental tests of physics and as field and inertial sensors .",
    "their quantized energy levels permit their use as clocks and frequency references , while the special role of measurements in quantum mechanics imposes fundamental sensitivity limits . in a quantum measurement",
    "the outcome is governed by probabilistic rules , and the optimal estimation of physical parameters by measurement data becomes a statistical inference problem . in this article",
    ", we address the problem of continuous quantum measurements and the optimal use of full measurement records in parameter estimation .",
    "the fluorescence signal from a laser excited two - level atom has a mean intensity , which in steady state is a known function of the field - atom detuning , the rabi - frequency and the atomic decay rate - but the full record of photon count events contains much more information than the mean signal . in the quantum trajectory picture of resonance fluorescence @xcite , each detector click is accompanied by an atomic quantum jump into the ground state and a subsequent transient evolution which leads to a modulation of the probability distribution for subsequent detection events .",
    "the time record of intervals between detector clicks or the cumulants of the counting statistics @xcite , therefore allow better discrimination between different values of the rabi - frequency than the steady state mean intensity .",
    "in recent works @xcite , the derivation of likelihood functions by application of bayes rule to continuous measurement records has been shown to follow in a quite straightforward manner from the theory of stochastic master equations and quantum trajectories . in @xcite a numerical procedure to achieve this goal , through simulation of the stochastic master equation , was presented with explicit attention to the cases of homodyne / heterodyne detection and photon counting .",
    "the expected asymptotic accomplishment of parameter estimation by stochastic measurement records was furthermore addressed in @xcite , and it was shown that monte carlo simulations of quantum trajectory ensembles can be used to estimate the fisher information and cramr rao bound @xcite associated with any particular detection scheme . for numerical examples of the fisher information in the case of photon counting , obtained by such simulations , see @xcite , and for a comparison between the fisher information and cramr rao bound for photon counting and homodyne detection ( as well as a theoretical optimal limit of sensitivity ) , see @xcite .",
    "due to the combined action of the hamiltonian and measurement back action on the system evolution , measurement records obtained in experiments generally depend on the system parameters in a complicated manner , and one should not expect any analytical expression for the fisher information connected to a particular detection scheme . in this article , however , we exploit a specific property of the quantum trajectories associated with fluorescence records from two - level emitters : the signal is a discrete set of detection times , and after each detection event the system populates the same state and recommences the same evolution .",
    "this implies that the distribution of delay times between detector clicks yields the same information as the full detection record .",
    "since this distribution can be determined analytically , our method permits analytic calculations and interpretation of the results in different limits along with a straightforward incorporation of finite detector efficiency in the analysis .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] we review the connection between stochastic quantum measurement dynamics and the bayesian parameter estimation problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stat ] we present the specific statistical analysis of the fisher information based on delay times between detector clicks in photon counting experiments . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] we conclude and present an outlook .",
    "a quantum measurement process can be regarded as a filter that allows particular components of the system wave function or density matrix to pass as representative of the state of the system if they are in accordance with the outcome of the measurement .",
    "such a quantum filter is readily augmented to include the identification of unknown classical parameters by treating them as physical properties of ancillary system degrees of freedom .",
    "a constant , unknown parameter can thus be formally described in the same way as a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) variable , @xcite , of an ancillary quantum system , and the evolution of the joint system by quantum measurement theory may effectively accomplish a qnd measurement of that parameter @xcite .",
    "an equivalent approach assigns possible candidate values to a _ particle filter _ , where separately evolved quantum states , assuming different parameter values , carry weight factors which are changed conditioned on the measurement outcomes @xcite .    in this section",
    "we recall the quantum jump dynamics of a laser driven two - level atom subject to fluorescence detection , and we present examples of how the observation of very few photons serves to distinguish between different values of the unknown rabi - frequency .",

    "the last term in the master equation ( [ masterligning_middel ] ) is related to the process of photon emission , yielding an incoherent increase in the ground state population .",
    "the other terms in ( [ masterligning_middel ] ) are associated with the atomic state component in the absence of emitted photons .",
    "monitoring the fluorescence signal conditions the state evolution on the resulting measurement record .",
    "photon detection causes a jump to the ground state @xmath10 , while the effect of detecting no photon in the field is to merely omit the contribution from the last term in ( [ masterligning_middel ] ) .",
    "the probabilities for these events to occur are given by the trace of the respective terms , which yields the expected probability @xmath11 for jumping into the ground state and @xmath12 for continuous no - jump evolution during time intervals with no photon detection @xcite .",
    "the field is reset to the vacuum state , the atomic state is renormalized and the evolution proceeds after the projection of the system on the one- and zero - photon components .",
    "an initially pure state remains pure , i.e. , it can be described by a state vector during this dynamics , and a wave function simulation scheme , where one uses random numbers to synthesize typical detection records , averaged over many such evolutions , yields the same results as the master equation eq .",

    "22 jumps are registered , consistent with an average excited state population of @xmath17 .",
    "while the number of clicks is statistically compatible with a rather wide range of values of @xmath8 , the time intervals between detector clicks provide sharper information about @xmath18 than the total number of clicks .",
    "the no - jump and jump dynamics are associated with detection of photons , and the probabilities of the respective detection events depend on the solution of the stochastic dynamics , which in turn depends on the parameters in the master equation .",
    "the measurement process therefore continuously provides information about these parameters .",
    "the formal treatment of this acquisition of information follows bayes rule : the probability for an unknown parameter to have a given value @xmath19 , conditioned on the stochastic measurement outcome @xmath20 , is given by the probability for that outcome conditioned on the value @xmath19 together with their unconditional ( prior ) probabilities , @xmath21 for our application , @xmath20 is the click or absence of a click in a time interval @xmath22 .",
    "the click , e.g. , occurs with a probability @xmath23 , conditioned on the value of the coupling strength in the master equation through its influence on the excited state population .",
    "bayes rule hence yields an update of the probability @xmath24 , assigned to different values of @xmath19 prior to detection in the time interval @xmath22 .",
    "the update rule is applied at every time step and thus acts as a filter on the values of the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "note that the denominator in eq .",
    "bayes rule is independent of @xmath19 , and it is in practical calculations not necessary to compute it at every step of the update protocol .",
    "one may , thus , describe the knowledge about the variable @xmath19 by ( un - normalized ) likelihood functions , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are merely proportional to the probability distribution .",
    "the final conditional likelihood function is given by simply multiplying together all the probability factors assigned by quantum measurement theory to the count and no - count events _ actually occurring _ during the experiment @xcite .",

    "[ fig : likelihood_3 ] by propagating stochastic wave functions assuming two alternative values , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , for the rabi frequency .",
    "the results in the second and third panel reveal slower and faster rabi oscillations between the jumps , which are selected in conformity with the ( simulated ) experimentally observed detector clicks , i.e. according to the dynamics governed by the true value @xmath13 of the rabi frequency .",
    "consequently in both the second and third panel we observe jumps at times , where the excited state population is small .",
    "such jumps are not very probable , and through bayes rule the conditional probabilities for the values @xmath27 and @xmath28 are correspondingly suppressed .",
    "assuming that only @xmath27 , @xmath18 , and @xmath28 are allowed values for the rabi frequency , and that they are a priori equally probable , panel 4 in fig.([fig : likelihood_3 ] ) shows the evolution of the respective probabilities as the detection record unfolds .",
    "let us go into detail with some of the features of the plot .",
    "one notices how non - click periods lead to smooth , continuous evolution while the clicks demand more pronounced changes .",
    "the first jump is in conflict with a rabi frequency of @xmath27 , while it favors @xmath28 which has the largest excited state amplitude here .",
    "the probability for @xmath29 , indeed , dominates for a while until further detection events signify that the clicks are actually selected according to the evolution with the correct value @xmath18 .",
    "the true value acquires a probability close to unity after merely 20 detector clicks .",
    "[ fig : likelihood_kontinuert ] shows the results of applying the same procedure for a wider range of candidate values of the rabi frequency on a fine grid and for longer time .",
    "the upper panel shows the excited state population associated with the simulation of a detection record , and the color plot shows how the likelihood function gradually develops a narrow peak around the correct value of the rabi frequency .     and @xmath14 .",
    "the two middle panels show the evolution conditioned on the same detection events as in the upper panel , but assuming @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the lower panel shows the evolution of the probabilities @xmath30 for the candidate values , @xmath31 ( solid , black , upper curve at @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 ( dashed , blue , middle curve at @xmath32 ) and @xmath29 ( dotted , red , lower curve at @xmath32 ) , conditioned on the measurement record . _",

    "our theory relies on two observations : ( _ i _ ) the full data record is unambiguously represented by a list of the instants of time @xmath42 where a photon is detected , ( _ ii _ ) the atom jumps to the same state after each detection event , and the waiting times , i.e. , the time intervals @xmath43 between subsequent jump events are therefore uncorrelated stochastic variables with the same probability distribution .",
    "it follows from ( _ ii _ ) that there is no information in the actual order of the different intervals recorded .",
    "thus , the only relevant information in the detection record is the distribution of registered intervals between jumps . in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay_test ] we show the distribution of 10000 time intervals between simulated quantum jumps ( blue dots ) .",
    "the comparison with the theoretical waiting time distribution ( red curve ) constitutes the basis of the parameter estimation since a higher or smaller value of the rabi frequency would change the oscillation period in the distribution of waiting times .     and @xmath44 .",
    "the red curve is the corresponding theoretical waiting time distribution @xmath45 for time intervals between detector clicks . _ _ ]    the data record @xmath20 is without loss of information reduced to the registered distribution of waiting times between jumps .",

    "the fisher information associated with a counting signal sampled from uncorrelated poisson distributions plays a role , e.g. , in microscopy where position dependent signals of scattered coherent light are used to track the position of scatterers with high resolution @xcite .",
    "the fisher information in that problem is known , and translating the position argument to the waiting time argument @xmath50 , we conclude that the sensitivity of sampling is governed by eq.([crb ] ) , where the fisher information reads @xcite @xmath51 if @xmath52 is known , only a one - dimensional integral has to be computed - a trivial task in comparison with the calculation envisaged in eq .",

    "it is remarkable that we obtain such a simple expression , which readily confirms that while the mean scattering rate saturates for strong driving , @xmath77 , the sensitivity per detected photon becomes constant , and we can resolve large rabi frequencies as accurately as intermediate ones .",
    "the expression for the fisher information per detected photon diverges for small rabi frequencies , the scattering rate , however , depends quadratically on small values of @xmath8 , so per time , the accumulated fisher information is finite and even independent of the rabi frequency when the two - level system is driven on resonance .",
    "it is easy to incorporate the effect of finite detector efficiency @xmath78 in the calculation of waiting time distributions : the information retrieved by detection of light with an efficiency @xmath79 is equivalent to the one held by an observer , who is told with a probability @xmath79 , whenever the detector clicks in a perfect experiment .",
    "when a detector click is reported such an observer knows with certainty that the atom is in the ground state ( the `` quantum jump '' occurs ) , while in the absence of reported clicks she can not be certain that no photons were actually detected .",

    "all curves show probability densities and are normalized to unity , but the time scale for the first detection increases when the detector efficiency is reduced . due to the possibility of missed earlier events the exact nodes in the waiting time distribution for perfect detection disappear , and while a detection within the first few @xmath88 is likely to report the first actual emission event by the atom , a later detection is almost certainly preceded by unobserved emission of photons by the atom .",
    "this explains why the modulation in the waiting time distribution is maintained for short times and gradually replaced by a smooth exponential curve for long times . since even small but finite @xmath79 yields a finite fraction of the detection events at short times where the delay function is strongly modulated in time by the rabi frequency , the sensitivity to the value of @xmath8 is still significantly improved by considering the actual waiting times rather than only the mean signal .",

    "for example , quantum ladder systems with decay from an intermediate state to the ground state are interesting probes , because electric and magnetic fields easily shift the energy of their excited state and significantly influence the system dynamics , e.g. , through the mechanism of electromagnetically induced transparency , @xcite .    following the general arguments in sec .",
    "iii , we have developed theory for systems with several distinguishable decay channels , leading to quantum jumps into different , distinct final states @xcite .",
    "we believe that in addition to their potential use for concrete precision measurements , the two - level systems studied in this article and extended models , tractable by similar means , may provide insights and tests for parameter estimation within a number of more complicated scenarios , including estimation of time dependent parameters and of sets of several unknown parameters .",
