    "the broad mechanism for radiation emission from a hot tenuous plasma is simple .",
    "thermal kinetic energy of free electrons in the plasma is transferred by collisions to the internal energy of impurity ions , @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes an excited state and @xmath2 the ground state of the impurity ion .",
    "this energy is then radiated as spectrum line photons which escape from the plasma volume @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the emitted photon energy and @xmath5 its frequency .",
    "similarly ions in general increase or decrease their charge state by collisions with electrons @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the next ionisation stage of impurity ion @xmath2 .",
    "the situation is often referred to as the _ coronal picture_. the coronal picture has been the basis for the description of impurities in fusion plasmas for many years .",
    "however , the progress towards ignition of fusion plasmas and to higher density plasmas requires a description beyond the coronal approximation . models of finite density plasmas which include some parts of the competition between radiative and collisional processes are loosely called _ collisional - radiative_. however , collisional - radiative theory in its origins ( bates , 1962 ) was designed for the description of dynamic plasmas and this aspect is essential for the present situations of divertors , heavy species , transport barriers and transient events . the present work is centred on _ generalised collisional radiative _ ( @xmath8 ) theory ( mcwhirter and summers , 1984 ) which is developed in the following sections .",
    "it is shown that consideration of relaxation time - scales , metastable states , secondary collisions etc . -",
    "aspects rigorously specified in collisional - radiative theory - allow an atomic description suitable for modelling the newer areas above .",
    "the detailed quantitative description is complicated because of the need to evaluate individually the many controlling collisional and radiative processes , a task which is compounded by the variety of atoms and ions which participate .",
    "the focus is restricted to plasmas which are optically thin and not influenced by external radiation fields , and for which ground and metastable populations of ions dominate other excited ion populations .",
    "the paper provides an overview of key methods used to expedite this for light elements and draws illustrative results from the ions of carbon , oxygen and neon .",
    "the paper is intended as the first of a series of papers on the application of collisional - radiative modelling in more advanced plasma scenarios and to specific important species .",
    "the practical implementation of the methods described here is part of the adas ( atomic data and analysis structure ) project ( summers , 1993 , 2004 ) .",
    "illustrations are drawn from adas codes and the adas fundamental and derived databases .",
    "the lifetimes of the various states of atoms , ions and electrons in a plasma to radiative or collisional processes vary enormously .",
    "of particular concern for spectroscopic studies of dynamic finite density plasmas are those of translational states of free electrons , atoms and ions and internal excited states ( including states of ionisation ) of atoms and ions .",
    "these lifetimes determine the relaxation times of the various populations , the rank order of which , together with their values relative to observation times and plasma development times determines the modelling approach .",
    "the key lifetimes divide into two groups .",
    "the first is the _ intrinsic _ group , comprising purely atomic parameters , and includes metastable radiative decay , @xmath9 , ordinary excited state radiative decay @xmath10 and auto - ionising state decay ( radiative and auger ) , @xmath11 .",
    "the intrinsic group for a particular ion is generally ordered as @xmath12 with typical values @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ion charge .",

    "these time - scales imply that the dominant populations of impurities in the plasma are those of the ground and metastable states of the various ions .",

    "this assumption is made throughout the present paper , but is relaxed in the next paper of the series ( bryans , 2005 ) .",
    "the basic model was established by bates ( 1962 ) .",
    "the ion in a plasma is viewed as composed of a complete set of levels indexed by @xmath37 and @xmath38 and a set of radiative and collisional couplings between them denoted by @xmath39 ( an element of the _ collisional - radiative matrix _ representing transition from @xmath38 to @xmath37 ) to which are added direct ionisations from each level of the ion to the next ionisation stage ( coefficient @xmath40 ) and direct recombinations to each level of the ion from the next ionisation stage ( coefficient @xmath41 ) .",

    "there are two kinds of derived coefficients associated with individual spectrum line emission in common use in fusion plasma diagnosis",

    "radiated power is the most relevant quantity for experimental detection . for modelling , it is the _ electron energy loss function _ which enters the fluid energy equation .",
    "the contribution to the total electron energy loss rate for the @xmath14-times ionised ion associated with ionisation and recombination from the @xmath43-times ionised ion is @xmath92 where the @xmath93 and @xmath94 are absolute energies of the metastables @xmath45 of the @xmath14-times ionised ion and of the metastables @xmath47 of the @xmath43-times ionised ion respectively .",
    "thus the electron energy loss is a derived quantity from the radiative power coefficients and the other generalised collisonal - radiative coefficients .",
    "note that cancellations in the summations cause the reduction to relative energies and that in ionisation equilibrium , the electron energy loss equals the radiative power loss .    in the following sections",
    ", it is shown how the quasi - static assumption and population categorisation allow us to solve the infinite level population structure of each ion in a manageable and efficient way .",

    "( l - s ) coupling is appropriate and it is sufficient to consider only terms , since although fine structure energy separations may be required for high resolution spectroscopy , relative populations of levels of a term are close to statistical .",

    "<S> the paper presents an integrated view of the population structure and its role in establishing the ionisation state of light elements in dynamic , finite density , laboratory and astrophysical plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> there are four main issues , the generalised collisional - radiative picture for metastables in dynamic plasmas with maxwellian free electrons and its particularising to light elements , the methods of bundling and projection for manipulating the population equations , the systematic production / use of state selective fundamental collision data in the metastable resolved picture to all levels for collisonal - radiative modelling and the delivery of appropriate derived coefficients for experiment analysis . </S>",
