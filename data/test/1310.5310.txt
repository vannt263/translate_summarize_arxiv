    "in the present - day view , mergers are a common and important way of building up massive elliptical galaxies . with the presence of supermassive black holes in the centers of most galaxies ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) , merger processes are thought to have left signatures on the central structure of the remnant galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggest that a binary black hole that is formed by the merger of two galaxies scours the stars from the center of the newly created system as the binary shrinks .",
    "the energy liberated by the hardening of the binary evacuates the central part through the ejection of surrounding stars , causing less light in the center",
    ".    _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) observations of galaxy nuclei see two kinds of behavior in the central light profiles of ellipticals , traditionally classified as `` power - law '' and `` core '' galaxies @xcite .",
    "the power - law profiles took their name from their approximation by a single power law at small radii ( @xmath6 or 20 ) .",
    "more modern interpretations have emphasized that these profiles can be better understood as the inward continuation of the galaxy s overall srsic profile , usually modified by an additional , nuclear - scale stellar component @xcite .",
    "the core galaxy , in contrast , displays a surface brightness profile with a distinct break from a steep outer slope to a shallower inner cusp .",
    "core profiles mainly occur in very luminous elliptical galaxies and are considered the result of dissipationless mergers of two galaxies that have central black holes .",
    "much numerical work has been done to explore the binary black hole idea .",
    "the work of @xcite suggests that the stellar mass ejected from the core is comparable to the mass of the central black hole @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite find that core radius roughly doubles after each major merger .",
    "@xcite , using isothermal king models , suggest that the core size should scale with the final @xmath0 .",
    "simulations performed by @xcite show for the first time that merging two galaxies with steep cusps can result in a merger remnant with a shallow power - law cusp in the inner part ( core ) .",
    "@xcite is the first to quantify the magnitude of the mass deficit ( or the mass ejected by the binary ) with respect to the galaxy s merger history . by following the binary evolution up to the stalling radius , he formulates the mass deficit to be @xmath7@xmath0  with @xmath8 is the number of major merger events .",
    "an investigation into the post - coalescence stage of the binary suggests that the mass deficit could still be larger .",
    "this is because the coalescing binary emits gravitational waves which impart a kick on the merged black hole and eject it from the center .",
    "due to dynamical friction , the resulting oscillations of the black hole would gradually damp , returning it to the center of the galaxy and ejecting more stars from the core .",
    "this process could increase the mass deficit existing before the binary coalescence by up to 5@xmath0  for a single merger @xcite .",
    "several publications in the past have performed function fitting to galaxy profiles in order to quantify the core parameters such as the core size , the deficit in light or mass , and to analyse the correlation between these core properties and @xmath0  or the global properties of the galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , kormendy et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter kfcb09 ) , kormendy & bender ( 2009 , hereafter kb09 ) , @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "these studies are based on different samples , datasets , approaches , parametrizations , and assumptions , which apparently lead to different , partly systematic , core quantities .",
    "the most important difference is the amount of central mass deficit with respect to the black hole mass that can be expected in core galaxies . @xcite and @xcite find an average mass deficit of around twice the black hole mass , @xcite derive central mass deficits of about 0.54 @xmath0  while find their mean mass deficit to be 10.5 @xmath0 . aside from that ,",
    "each of these studies has a drawback in at least one of three aspects crucial to achieve high accuracy .",
    "the first is the radial range of the surface brightness profiles .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite fit galaxy profiles that extend typically to only 1020 .",
    "moreover , it appears that some galaxy profiles in @xcite , which are taken from lauer et  al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter l05 ) , suffer from oversubtraction of the sky that biases the core - srsic fits ( see section [ previousfits ] ) .",
    "a full galaxy profile is necessary to properly measure the outer profile , to optimally remove the sky background , and thus to provide better constraints on the light and mass deficit .",
    "the second is the determination of the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath9 ) to convert the light deficit to the mass deficit . in the past studies ,",
    "either different values are assigned to the galaxies according to their luminosities ( @xcite , ) or a constant value is assumed for all the galaxies in the sample ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this of course introduces additional uncertainties and biases in deriving the mass deficits .",
    "the last important aspect lies in the black hole masses , which are mostly derived from outdated black hole - bulge relations , especially the ones between @xmath0  and the velocity dispersion of the host bulge ( @xmath0@xmath3relation ) .",
    "the majority of core galaxies are bright massive elliptical galaxies . for this class of galaxies",
    "@xcite find that the @xmath10-@xmath11  relation predicts a higher density of massive black holes ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ) compared to the @xmath0@xmath3  relation .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0@xmath3  relation used in these papers also fails to predict the existence of the largest black holes ( @xmath14@xmath13 ) that are found in distant quasars @xcite in the sample of local galaxies .",
    "the recent finding of black holes of 10 billion solar masses @xcite , which might be the missing link between the local black holes and the massive distant quasars , further supports the indications that the previous @xmath0@xmath3  relations for massive bright early type galaxies need to be reevaluated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , most previous studies have used @xmath0  measurements ( or @xmath0@xmath3relations based on @xmath0  measurements ) which did not include dark - matter halos in the modeling .",
    "values typically increase by @xmath15% @xcite or 30% ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) when dark matter is included in the modeling , but the increase can be as large as a factor of 6 when the black hole s sphere of influence is not well resolved @xcite . in the particular sample that we use in this paper , which includes bcgs , we find that the measured black hole mass is on average more than 3 times higher than that predicted by the @xmath0@xmath3  relation ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper , we combine improved core - property measurements with new measurements and present the analysis of possible relations between the core and black hole mass or the galaxy properties .",
    "we use only directly measured black hole masses and consequently avoiding scatter and possible biases inherent in using proxy measurements .",
    "we use dynamically - determined , individual stellar mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath2 ) to estimate the mass deficit , instead of relying on a scaling function or a constant value .",
    "we also use full galaxy profiles in the fitting and the quantification of the core parameters .",
    "our analysis is based on a sample of 20 galaxies ; seven of these galaxies are taken from , in which the black hole masses and @xmath2  are derived taking into account the presence of dark matter halos . for completeness , we add a further 3 galaxies to the sample ; they are not included in the main sample due to the lack of reliable literature sources for the black hole masses . in order to derive the mass deficit ,",
    "we assume that the original ( pre - scouring ) profile is the extrapolated srsic  profile that fits the light distribution at large radii . in section  [ themethod ] ,",
    "we describe the method that we use to identify the core galaxies and to fit the observed surface brightness profiles . in section  [ corefitting ]",
    ", we present the best - fitting models for each galaxy ; cases where galaxies are best fit with the addition of an outer envelope are discussed in section  [ multi - component - fits ] .",
    "we compare the fitting results with previous studies in section  [ previousfits ] .",
    "section  [ coredeficit ] presents the details of how the luminosity and mass deficit in the core are computed based on the best - fitting models .",
    "the core - related quantities derived in section  [ corefitting ] and [ coredeficit ] are compared with the black hole mass , velocity dispersion and galaxy luminosity in section [ bhcore ] .",
    "the last section discusses and summarizes the results .",
    "all of the photometric profiles examined in this work are quite extended , reaching out to at least 9 kpc .",
    "therefore , we base our analysis on a function that is designed to fit not just the inner or the outer part of galaxies , but rather the galaxy as a whole . to identify core galaxies , we follow the criteria in @xcite and @xcite , who define the core as `` a downward deviation from the inward extrapolation of the outer ( srsic ) profile '' .",
    "this involves fitting the galaxy in question with both the srsic  and the core - srsicfunctions .",
    "the srsic  profile @xcite is written as : @xmath16 \\right\\}. \\label{sersiceq}\\ ] ] @xmath17 is the intensity at @xmath18 , the projected half - light radius .",
    "@xmath19 is called the srsic  index which describes the shape or curvature of the light profile .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is a function of @xmath19 , defined in such a way that @xmath18 encloses half of the total luminosity .",
    "we approximate @xmath21 by using the asymptotic expansion of @xcite , eq . 18 for @xmath22 .",
    "many other approximation formulas are available and are summarized in @xcite . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the srsic  function reduces to an exponential function and for @xmath24 , it becomes the de vaucouleurs profile @xcite .",
    "the core - srsic  function introduced by @xcite and @xcite is expressed as : @xmath25^{\\gamma/\\alpha}\\,{\\rm exp}\\left[-b_n\\left(\\frac{r^\\alpha+r_b^\\alpha}{r_e^\\alpha}\\right)^{1/n\\alpha}\\right ] \\label{coresersiceq1}\\ ] ] with @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{coresersiceq2}\\ ] ] this profile consists of a srsic  profile in the outer part , specified by the projected half - light radius @xmath18 and the srsic  index @xmath19 , and a power - law profile in the inner part with a slope of @xmath27 . the change from one to another regime occurs at the break radius @xmath28 and the sharpness of the transition is specified by the parameter @xmath29 .",
    "higher values of @xmath29 mean sharper transitions .",
    "@xmath20 is approximated in the same way as for the srsic  function .",
    "we summarize four criteria in @xcite that we use to identify core galaxies below . in section [ corefitting ]",
    "we examine each criterion .    1",
    ".   a characteristic pattern should be visible in the residuals when fitting a srsic  profile to an idealized core galaxy .",
    "this serves as a qualitative evidence .",
    "2 .   a core - srsic  function gives a significantly better fit than a srsicmodel .",
    "quantitatively , it is expected that the reduced @xmath30 value for the srsic  fit @xmath31 is larger than twice that of the core - srsicfit @xmath32 .",
    "3 .   to avoid an ambiguous core detection , the potential core must be well - resolved by the data .",
    "quantitatively , @xmath28 should be @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the second innermost datapoint in the observed profile .",
    "4 .   the power - law slope has to be consistently less than the slope of the srsic  fit inside @xmath28 .",
    "we decided to adopt an additional criterion based on resolution limits .",
    "trujillo et al .  did not include such a limit , partly because many of their profiles did not probe radii smaller than the _ hst _ resolution limit due to dust , etc . ; however , they did note that one of their `` possible core '' galaxies ( ngc 3613 ) had a break radius smaller than the resolution limit of 0.16  originally suggested by @xcite .",
    "the latter limit is @xmath35 times the fwhm of most of the pc data used by @xcite ; generalizing this , we suggest the following additional criterion :    1",
    ".   the potential core should have @xmath36 the fwhm of the imaging data used for the innermost part of the profile . for most of the galaxies considered in this paper , which use optical wfpc2 or acs / wfc data",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath37 ; for two galaxies using nicmos2 data ( ngc 4261 and ngc 4374 ) , the limit would be @xmath38 , and for ngc 1550 , where we use sinfoni data with a fwhm of 0.17 , the limit would be 0.34 .",
    "we construct a one - dimensional light profile along the circularized radius ( mean profile ) , instead of along the semi major radius as is commonly done .",
    "the circularized radius is defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the semi major and semi minor axes radius of the isophote .",
    "this way , we take into account the variation of ellipticity with radius , giving a fair representation of the isophotes .",
    "the use of this mean profile is consistent with the implementation of the psf ( point spread function ) correction ( section [ psfconv ] ) .",
    "the fitting is done using a one - dimensional profile fitting software written by p. erwin .",
    "an initial model is generated based on user - given starting values .",
    "it is compared to the observed profile and the @xmath30 is calculated .",
    "the best - fitting solution is achieved by minimizing the @xmath30 of the fit , using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm @xcite .",
    "the user provides a starting value and its range of allowed values for each free parameter of the model .",
    "there are three free parameters in the srsic  model , i.e. @xmath19 , @xmath18 , @xmath17 and there are six free parameters in the core - srsic  model , i.e. @xmath19 , @xmath28 , @xmath18 , @xmath42 , @xmath29 , @xmath27 .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the inner region of the galaxy , the blurring of the central light profile by the psf becomes important and has to be taken into account . for several galaxies ,",
    "the photometric profiles are derived from deconvolved images ( see table  [ tab : coresample ] ) .",
    "we fit these profiles as described in the previous paragraph . for the other galaxies we incorporate a psf correction routine , described in the next section , into the fitting program such that the initial model is convolved first before being compared to the observed light profile . in this case",
    ", the minimised @xmath30 represents the difference between the convolved model and the data .",
    "the psf convolution is done at every iteration .",
    "equal to 1/40 of the half - light radius of the srsic model .",
    "dashed lines and diamonds show the case of a circular srsic  image ; the solid lines and rectangles are for an elliptical srsic image ( ellipticity = @xmath43 ) .",
    "the red lines are the unconvolved srsic  models .",
    "the black symbols are the results of one - dimensional convolution ( equation [ equ5]-[equ7 ] ) and the blue lines are the radial profiles of the convolved images , derived using ellipse - fitting . *",
    "bottom panel : * the flux ratio or the difference in surface brightness ( @xmath44 ) between the one - dimensionally convolved srsic  profile ( @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) and the radial profile of the convolved srsic  image ( @xmath47 or @xmath48 ) for both the circular and elliptical cases .",
    "+ ]    for galaxies whose light profiles are not seeing - corrected , we take the psf into account in the fitting by means of convolution .",
    "we use the psf corresponding to the galaxy image used to derive the innermost galaxy isophotes .",
    "for the galaxies from , the psf image is the same one which was used in the deprojection .",
    "for the other galaxies , the psf image is generated using tinytim by supplying the appropriate filter and camera . from the image , we generate a circularized profile of the psf by averaging its radial profile at different azimuthal angles ( done using midas ) .",
    "we further normalize the psf profile such that the total flux is one .",
    "the implementation of the convolution follows @xcite ( their appendix a ) .",
    "below , we review the method .",
    "the psf convolution is carried out by multiplying the galaxy surface brightness profile and the psf in the fourier space . on the sky ,",
    "the galaxy surface brightness is a function of a two - dimensional position * r * and so is the psf .",
    "if @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the surface brightness and the psf distribution , then the convolved surface brightness profile becomes : @xmath51 where @xmath52    since we use a one - dimensional , circularized surface brightness profile , i or p are a function of only the radius @xmath53 . in this case , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the bessel function of order zero .",
    "then , equation [ eqq ] becomes : @xmath56 with @xmath57 @xmath58    in this way , although the surface - brightness and the psf profiles are one dimensional , the convolution is implemented such that the light coming from different angles is also taken into account .",
    "this is important because the light is scattered , due to the seeing , not only in the radial but also in the azimuthal direction .",
    "equations [ equ5]-[equ7 ] are also called the hankel transform .",
    "we compute the convolved surface brightness profile numerically , making use of integration routines in the gnu scientific library .    fig .",
    "[ testconv ] shows how well this convolution works in the case of circular ( upper profiles ) and non - circular ( lower profiles ) images .",
    "for the former , we generate a galaxy image which follows a srsic  law with @xmath24 and zero ellipticity everywhere using the ` makeimage ` program from the two - dimensional image - fitting package imfit ( erwin , in preparation ) . for the psf",
    ", we create a circular gaussian image with @xmath3 = 1/40 of the half - light radius of the galaxy model .",
    "we extract the radial profile of both images and use these to perform the one - dimensional convolution as described above . as an independent check",
    ", we separately convolve the galaxy image with the gaussian image in imfit . the radial profile of this convolved image ( @xmath47 )",
    "is compared to the result of the 1d convolution ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the ratio is shown in the lower panel of the figure by the dashed line .",
    "this process is then repeated for a srsic image with an ellipticity of 0.4 .",
    "the circularized profile of the convolved elliptical image is shown by the solid blue line and this is compared to the 1d convolution result ( the rectangles ) ; the ratio of both is displayed as the solid line in the lower panel .",
    "the method works well in the case of circular galaxy and shows a deviation of less than 0.02 mag arcsec@xmath59 for an elliptical image ; we have repeated this exercise for different srsic indices , resulting in similar conclusions . since the ellipticity of 0.4 is larger than the ones measured in the majority of galaxies in our sample , we expect smaller errors in the actual galaxy case .",
    "the list of galaxies examined in this section is given in table  [ tab : coresample ] , along with the data sources .",
    "we compiled this list taking into account all galaxies which had both dynamically measured central black hole mass and evidence for cores , but in the end retained only those with clear evidence for a core _ and _ good enough data for measuring the core properties .",
    "the recent compilation of @xcite lists 9 more galaxies which we do not include : a1836-bcg , a3565-bcg ( ic 4296 ) , ngc 524 ngc3607 , ngc4473 , ngc5077 , ngc5128 , ngc5576 , ngc7052 .",
    "strong nuclear dust in a1836-bcg , ic 4296 , ngc3607 , ngc 5128 and ngc7052 makes it very difficult to robustly compute the core properties , so these galaxies are not included .",
    "ngc  4473 has been shown not to be a core galaxy by @xcite , , and @xcite , while the same is true for ngc  5576 @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite were only able to classify ngc  5077 as a `` possible core '' galaxy , so we exclude it as well . ngc  524 is a particularly problematic case , since there is evidence for very complex morphology ",
    "e.g. , @xcite fit a ground - based image using a srsic bulge , an exponential disk , and two `` lens '' components .",
    "this means that a simple core - srsic fit  or even core - srsic + outer envelope , as we use for some galaxies  is probably not appropriate .",
    "in addition , the best available high - resolution data is _ hst_-nicmos2 , and the fit to this data by @xcite suggests a core break radius @xmath60 , which is smaller than our adopted resolution limit for nicmos2 data ( see section [ identifycore ] ) .",
    "( wfpc2 images are not usable due to the extensive circumnuclear dust lanes . )",
    "we reluctantly exclude this galaxy as well .",
    "ngc1374 represents a case where the core detection is ambiguous , so it is discussed independently in a separate section .",
    "this galaxy was classified as a non - core galaxy in @xcite using a limited dataset from , and also by @xcite using a more extended acs - wfc profile from @xcite ; in section  [ n1374 ] we show the fit using our surface brightness profile which is slightly more extended in radius and which does not suffer the possible sky - subtraction uncertainties of the acs - only turner et al .",
    "table  [ tab : csparams ] summarizes the list of galaxies for which the presence of core is confirmed .",
    "the best - fitting core - srsic  parameters are also given in the same table .",
    "the best - fit srsic  and core - srsic  functions of these galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fittingplots ] and the criteria which lead to the core identification are discussed below .      when possible , we use all the available datapoints in the fitting . for all galaxies ,",
    "the core - srsic  function gives a much better fit to the whole profile than the srsic .",
    "in several galaxies , however , we find that the fit residuals become rather large at several outermost datapoints .",
    "since these datapoints do not seem to be well - described by a srsicfunction , they are excluded from the fit .",
    "we keep only the datapoints where the fit residual is less than 0.15 mag .",
    "the deviation from the srsic model at large radii by more than 0.15 mag may be caused by imperfect sky subtraction or it may represent a real departure from the srsic  profile , for example when where an outer halo is present ; see section  [ multi - component - fits ] for details on fits using extra components .",

    "[ fittingplots ] . in this figure ,",
    "the surface brightness profiles shown are not corrected for galactic extinction .    in all the galaxies in fig .",
    "[ fittingplots ] we see a pattern in the residuals of the srsic  fit that qualitatively suggests the presence of the core ",
    "compare to fig .  3 in @xcite .",
    "this residual pattern disappears when the galaxy is fitted with the core - srsic  profile .",
    "so the first criterion in section [ identifycore ] is secured . in each case , the rms of the residuals for the best srsic  fit is much larger than that for the core - srsic .",
    "the @xmath30 values for each galaxy are calculated by adopting the residual rms of the best core - srsic  fit as the error on the surface brightness measurements . as discussed in ,",
    "this estimate for the real error is reasonable as long as the rms is of order of the profile measurement error , i.e. , a few hundredths of a mag arcsec@xmath59 , which is indeed the case for all the galaxies that we examine . using this error approximation , the @xmath30 of the core - srsic  fit",
    "is artificially set to 1.0 .",
    "note that the rms and @xmath30 values are dependent on the radial extent and the radial sampling ( logarithmic sampling is used here ) .",
    "we find that the ( reduced ) @xmath30 value for each srsic  fit is much more than twice that of the core - srsic .",
    "the average ratio of @xmath61 is around 49 , with a minimum of 6.8 , easily fulfilling the second criterion . to assess the third criterion",
    ", one can compare the position of the second innermost datapoint to the position of the dotted vertical line which marks the break radius .",
    "it is thus clear that we have cases of resolved cores .",
    "the fourth point is also satisfied , since inside the break radius the core - srsic  function shows a consistent deficit in light compared to the extrapolated srsicprofile ( shown by the blue line ) . for the cases where we exclude some datapoints ,",
    "the core is already well identified when fitting all the datapoints , i.e. fulfilling the four criteria simultaneously .",
    "limiting the fitting range only improves the distinction .",

    "several exhibit more complex structures . inside @xmath62 ,",
    "the surface - brightness profile of ic1459 seems to show a small excess of light .",
    "we model this nuclear excess as an extra gaussian component in the center on top of the core - srsic  function , which after psf convolution provides a good fit to the data .",
    "( in the cases of ngc1407 and ngc4552 , it is not clear that their inner excesses can be modeled with a gaussian , so we exclude the data at @xmath63 for ngc1407 and @xmath64 for ngc4552 . ) for six galaxies ( including ngc1407 ) , we find that significantly better fits are achieved by including one or two extra srsic  or exponential components , representing outer halos .",
    "this approach is discussed in more detail in section  [ multi - component - fits ] .",
    "the parameter values of the best - fit core - srsic  model for each galaxy are provided in table  [ tab : csparams ] .",
    "the uncertainties of the core - srsicparameters are determined through a monte carlo simulation ( see next section ) .",
    "the srsic  indices for these galaxies are almost all larger than 4 , something which is common for giant ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite , ) .",
    "the exceptions are four of the galaxies which we model with multiple components ( see section  [ multi - component - fits ] ) .",
    "the best - fit @xmath29 parameter for ngc7768 is found to be 16.6 .",
    "this large value indicates a very sharp transition between the srsic  and the power - law profile .",
    "when the fit is repeated with @xmath65 , which is a good approximation for @xmath66 @xcite , the best - fit values for the other five parameters hardly change .",
    "since for large @xmath29 ( @xmath67 10 ) the profile becomes insensitive to the exact value of @xmath29 , we prefer to use the latter fit ( fixing @xmath29 to 100 ) to the light profile of ngc7768 .",
    "this choice prevents wildly varying values of @xmath29 that are not physically meaningful in the monte carlo simulations .    for six galaxies whose",

    "the ellipticity of the srsic  model is fixed to the ellipticity at the inner limit of the fitted radial range . since some of our light profiles are not psf - deconvolved , we instead compute the difference between the best - fitting core - srsic  function and the extrapolated srsic  component .",
