    "it was shown by schwinger@xcite that electrons get an anomalous magnetic moment @xmath0 ( being @xmath1 the bohr magneton ) due to qed radiative corrections . by considering the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in vacuum in presence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "shabad @xcite showed the drastic departure of the photon dispersion equation from the light cone curve near the energy thresholds for free pair creation .",
    "three different modes of photon propagation were found according to the eigenvalues of the polarization operator in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "some years later , the same property was obtained @xcite in the vicinity of the threshold for positronium creation . as a result ,",
    "the problem of the propagation of light in empty space , in presence of an external magnetic field is similar to the problem of the dispersion of light in an anisotropic medium@xcite , where the role of the medium is played by the polarized vacuum in the external magnetic field .",
    "an anisotropy is created by the preferred direction in space along @xmath2 . in this context",
    "we can mention other characteristics of magnetized quantum vacuum , as the birefringence@xcite , ( which plays an important role in the photon splitting and capture effect ) , and the vacuum magnetization @xcite .    from the previous paragraph",
    "we may conjecture that , similar to the case of the electron@xcite , a photon anomalous magnetic moment might also exist , as a consequence of its radiative corrections in presence of the magnetic field .",
    "we want to show in what follows that this conjecture is true : the photon having a non vanishing momentum component orthogonal to a constant magnetic field , exhibits such anomalous magnetic moment due to its interaction with the virtual electron - positron pairs in the magnetized vacuum where it propagates .    in order to calculate this photon intrinsic property",
    "we recall that schwinger s",
    "result @xcite was obtained by a weak field approximation of the electron green s function in the self energy operator . in place of using such approximation in the calculation of the photon anomalous magnetic moment",

    "we get the photon equation of motion , in which we may take the weak as well as the strong field limits . in any case , we get that the photon acquires a magnetic moment along the external field , which is proportional to the electron anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "for the zero field case the photon magnetic moment strictly vanishes , but for small fields @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 g is the schwinger critical field ) it is significant for a wide range of frequencies . this might be interesting in an astrophysical context , for instance , in the propagation and light deflection near a dense magnetized object .    moreover",

    "we discuss mainly the so - called second mode of propagation near the first pair creation threshold @xmath7 , since as it was studied in @xcite , in the realistic conditions of production and propagation of @xmath9 quanta the third mode decays into the second mode via the photon splitting @xmath10 process @xcite .",

    "in paper@xcite it was shown that the presence of the constant magnetic field , creates , in addition to the photon momentum four - vector @xmath14 , three other four - vectors , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the electromagnetic field tensor and @xmath19 its dual pseudotensor .",

    "moreover it causes a drastic departure of the photon dispersion equation from the light cone curve near the energy thresholds for free pair creation .",
    "this characteristic stems from the arising of bound states in the external field , leading to a singular behavior of the polarization operator @xmath49 near the pair creation thresholds for electrons and positrons .",
    "these particles , coming from the photon decay in the external field , appear in landau levels @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( cyclotron resonance ) , or either still stronger singular behavior of @xmath57 near the thresholds of an @xmath58 bound state ( due to positronium formation ) .    to understand the different behavior of @xmath49 in presence of an external magnetic field , as compared to the zero field case , we recall that in the latter problem the polarization operator is rotationally invariant with regard to the only significant four - vector , @xmath14 , whereas in the magnetic field case this symmetry is reduced to axial .",
    "thus , it is invariant under rotations in the plane perpendicular to the external field @xmath2 .",
    "the presence of the interaction energy of the photon with the electron - positron field opens the possibility of defining a magnetic moment for the photon , for this we expand the dispersion equation in linear terms of @xmath59 around some field value @xmath60 , @xmath61    this means that , in the rest frame , where no electric field exists the photon exhibits a longitudinal magnetic moment given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an unit vector in the direction along the magnetic field @xmath64 .",
    "the modulus of the magnetic moment along @xmath2 can be expressed as @xmath65 where the factor @xmath66 is a sort of gyromagnetic ratio . as in the case of the electron@xcite @xmath67 is not a constant of motion , but is a quantum average .",
    "as different from the classical theory of propagation of electromagnetic radiation in presence of a constant external magnetic field , it is expected that @xmath68 be different from zero due to radiative corrections , which are dependent on @xmath69 .",
    "the magnetic moment is induced by the external field on the photon through its interaction with the polarized electron - positron virtual quanta of vacuum and is oriented along @xmath70 .",
    "the gauge invariance property @xmath71 implies that the function @xmath72 vanishes when @xmath73 , this means that the anomalous magnetic moment of the photon is a magnitude subject to the gauge invariance property of the theory and therefore when the propagation is parallel to @xmath74 , @xmath75 , is cancelled . in every mode , including positronium formation @xmath76 therefore the magnetic moment of the radiation is determined essentially by the perpendicular photon momentum component and this determines the optical properties of the quantum vacuum .",
    "particularly interesting is the case when @xmath77 .",
    "if @xmath74 is assumed small @xmath78 , the dispersion law can be written as @xmath79 the first term of ( [ de0 ] ) corresponds to the light cone equation , whereas the second contains the dipole moment contribution of the virtual pairs @xmath80 .    by substitution of ( [ de0 ] ) in ( [ wavectors2 ] ) and ( [ wavectors3 ] )",
    "we obtain that the electric and magnetic fields of the radiation corresponding to the second and third modes are increased by the factors @xmath81 @xmath82.\\ ] ] therefore , the magnetic moment of the photon leads to linear effects in quantum electrodynamics and in consequence the refraction index @xmath83 in mode @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 the gauge invariant property ( [ gauge ] ) implies that the refraction index for parallel propagation , @xmath75 , be exactly unity : for any mode @xmath86 .",
    "this can be reinterpreted by saying that for parallel propagation to @xmath87 the refraction index is equal to unity due to the vanishing of the photon magnetic moment .",
    "the components of the group velocity , ( @xmath88 ) , @xmath89 can be written as @xmath90 and @xmath91    it follows from ( [ vper ] ) and ( [ vpara ] ) that the angle @xmath92 between the direction of the group velocity and the external magnetic field satisfies the relation @xmath93 being @xmath94 the angle between the photon momentum and @xmath2 , with @xmath95 .",

    "the first and third modes with energies range less than the first cyclotron resonance , whose energy is given by @xmath101 , does not show any singular behavior and in this sense they behave similarly to the eigenvalues does not contribute .",
    "it follows that the dispersion law for the first and third modes are given by @xmath102 .",
    "nevertheless , from the calculations made in appendix a it is seen that the second eigenvalue can be expressed as in the low frequency limit @xmath103 as @xmath104 here @xmath105 is the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron .",
