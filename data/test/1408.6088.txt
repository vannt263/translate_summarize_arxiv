    "the thermodynamic analogue of the casimir effect originating from the confinement of vacuum fluctuations @xcite is the critical casimir effect due to the presence of long - ranged thermal fluctuations in a fluid close to its critical point at @xmath0 .",

    "experimentally , critical casimir forces have been studied only during the last decade when first measurements were performed indirectly via monitoring the thickness of wetting films upon approaching a critical end point @xcite .",

    "this generic preference of the surfaces confining the liquid can be described by effective surface fields . upon approaching @xmath4 , the critical adsorption profiles , which describe the concentration enhancement near the surface , become long ranged due to the concomitant divergence of the bulk correlation length @xcite . in semi - infinite systems , the transition from the phase in which only the region near the single surface is ordered to the one",
    "in which also the bulk is ordered is known as the extraordinary or normal transition @xcite . for two surfaces opposing each other , depending on the mutual combinations of boundary conditions ( bcs ) critical casimir forces are either attractive or repulsive .",

    "it was found that , for large distances between a sawtooth - shaped wall and a planar wall , the critical casimir force effectively corresponds to the one between two planar walls ; on the other hand , for short distances between the two surfaces , the tips of the ridges dominate the order parameter profile and the characteristic power law behavior of the critical casimir force differs from that for planar surfaces @xcite .",

    "second , in section  [ sec : force ] we study the critical casimir forces acting on such geometrically structured substrates .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] we summarize our main findings .",
    "according to the theory of finite - size scaling , the singular contribution to the critical casimir force is described by a universal scaling function , which is independent of the molecular details of the binary liquid mixture and depends only on the bulk universality class of the associated critical point @xcite . here , we focus on the ising universality class characterized by a scalar order parameter @xmath3 , which encompasses the experimentally relevant binary liquid mixtures and simple fluids . upon approaching the critical point of the fluid ,",
    "the bulk correlation length diverges as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 in spatial dimension @xmath21 and @xmath22 in spatial dimension @xmath23 @xcite ; @xmath24 are nonuniversal amplitudes characterized by the universal ratio @xmath25 in @xmath21 and @xmath26 in @xmath23 .",
    "the sign of the reduced temperature @xmath27 is chosen such that @xmath28 corresponds to the mixed ( disordered ) phase of the fluid , whereas @xmath29 corresponds to the ordered phase , corresponding to spontaneous phase separation .",
    "for an upper critical point the homogeneous phase is found at high temperatures , and one has @xmath13",
    ". however , many experimentally relevant binary liquid mixtures exhibit a lower critical point ; in this case @xmath30 .    in general , the sign and the amplitude of the critical casimir force depend on the types of effective chemical bcs at the walls and on the geometry of the confining surfaces . here",
    "we focus on the case of equal , symmetry - breaking @xmath31 bcs , which corresponds to the generic case of preferential adsorption of one of the two species of a binary liquid mixture .",
    "this leads to an attractive critical casimir force @xcite .",
    "inspired by experiments encompassing binary liquid mixtures of water and lutidine ( with a lower critical point at @xmath32 ) @xcite , here a binary liquid mixture with a lower critical point is considered at fixed pressure and at its critical composition .",
    "first , we briefly review the film geometry . in this case",
    "the liquid is confined between two parallel , macroscopically extended walls at a distance @xmath33 . according to renormalization group theory",
    "the critical casimir force @xmath34 per area of one wall , which is acting on the parallel walls ( @xmath35 ) , scales as @xcite @xmath36 the scaling function @xmath37 depends only on a single scaling variable given by the film thickness @xmath33 in units of @xmath38 , raised to the power @xmath39 . for equal chemical bcs , as discussed here , @xmath40 is negative , so that the critical casimir force is attractive . for @xmath41",
    "the scaling function of the critical casimir force reduces to a universal constant value , the so - called critical casimir amplitude @xcite : @xmath42 accordingly , at @xmath4 the critical casimir force decays algebraicly @xmath43 .",
    "away from criticality , the critical casimir force decays exponentially as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath37 has been calculated exactly in @xmath45 @xcite , for @xmath46 using a perturbative field - theoretical method @xcite or a local - functional method @xcite , and in @xmath21 numerically via monte carlo simulations @xcite .      in the following we consider a crenellated wall located at a minimal surface - to - surface distance @xmath17 from a planar wall as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .",
    "the width and depth of the crenels are given by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , and the structure is periodic along the lateral @xmath47-direction with period @xmath7 , so that the width of the merlons , i.e. , the surface - to - surface separation between two neighboring crenels , is given by @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , the corresponding universal contribution to the critical casimir force @xmath48 per area of the planar wall scales as @xmath49 where the geometrical parameters form the following scaling variables : @xmath50    the critical casimir force between a crenellated and a planar wall attains the value of the corresponding force between two planar walls in various limits .",
    "for very shallow crenels , i.e. , in the limit @xmath51 or @xmath52 , the following relation holds : @xmath53 as will be discussed in more detail below , we find that for narrow crenels with @xmath54 , the order parameter profile attains the form of the planar wall geometry , _ independent _ of the value of @xmath55 : @xmath56 similarly , for @xmath57 , one has @xmath58    for very broad crenels compared with the film thickness , i.e. , @xmath59 , the limiting behavior of the scaling function of the critical casimir force is given by the average of the scaling functions for two planar walls at distances @xmath17 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to the so - called proximity force approximation ( pfa ) , which we discuss in the following . within the pfa",
    "the surfaces are subdivided into infinitely small elements parallel to each other , and the resulting force is obtained by pairwise adding the individual contributions to the force .",
    "the derjaguin approximation is a special case of the pfa for smoothly curved surfaces .",

    "] acts along the @xmath62-direction and is the sum of two contributions : ( i ) the force between the fraction @xmath63 of the upper flat wall and the top surfaces of the merlons separated by the distance @xmath17 , and ( ii ) the force between the fraction @xmath64 of the upper flat wall and the bottom surfaces of the crenels separated by the distance @xmath60 : @xmath65 accordingly , the scaling function of the critical casimir force within the pfa is given by @xmath66 the scaling function @xmath67 is independent of @xmath68 because within pfa the effective interactions between the steps and the upper wall are ignored .",
    "that is , as long the values of @xmath64 and @xmath55 are fixed , steps may be arbitrarily added to or removed from the structured substrate ( e.g. , via a transformation @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 ) without changing the force within pfa , independent of the value of @xmath68 .",
    "analogous to the case of chemically striped surfaces , discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , every isolated geometrical step gives rise to a contribution to the scaling function of the critical casimir force per area which is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior for @xmath59 of the universal scaling function for the critical casimir force between a planar wall and a crenellated surface is therefore given by @xmath73 where we define @xmath74 as the universal contribution of a pair of geometrical steps as sketched in fig .",

    "this may not only be useful for the analysis of critical casimir forces in such experimentally relevant , designed geometries , but could also help in understanding unavoidable roughness corrections in the case of planar geometries .",
