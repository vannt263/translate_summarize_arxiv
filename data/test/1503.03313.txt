    "when an energetic quark or gluon propagates through a dense partonic system such as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , it interacts with the hot medium through multiple scattering and induced gluon bremsstrahlung , leading to transverse momentum broadening and energy loss of the propagating parton . as a consequence , spectra of large transverse momentum hadrons and jets in high - energy heavy - ion collisions should be suppressed if a dense partonic matter is formed in the early stage of the collisions . this phenomenon is called jet quenching and has been proposed as a powerful tool for the study of properties of the qgp in high - energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it has been observed in experiments at both the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite as evidence for the formation of strongly interacting qgp in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "investigators observed not only the suppression of single inclusive hadron spectra at large transverse momentum @xcite but also back - to - back dihadron @xcite and gamma - hadron correlations @xcite .",
    "the jet quenching phenomenon becomes even more dramatic in heavy - ion collisions at lhc when one observes the onset of dijets and gamma jets with large asymmetries in transverse energy @xcite .",
    "these patterns of jet quenching can all be understood quantitatively within the picture of multiple scattering and parton energy loss @xcite-@xcite .    within the picture of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , the interaction between an energetic parton and the medium is dominated by small - angle scattering and induced gluon radiation .",
    "the transverse momentum broadening and energy loss of the propagating parton depend on the transverse momentum transfer from the medium during each scattering which in turn encodes the interaction among medium partons at the scale as probed by the energetic parton .",
    "the jet transport parameter defined as the averaged transverse momentum broadening squared per unit length of propagation represents a fundamental property of the medium @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recent phenomenological studies of single - hadron suppression in high - energy heavy - ion collisions within collinear factorized pqcd models give extracted values of the transport parameter @xmath0 gev@xmath1/fm and @xmath2 gev@xmath1/fm at an initial time @xmath3 fm/@xmath4 for a 10 gev quark at the center of most central au+au collisions at @xmath5 gev and pb+pb collisions at @xmath6 tev , respectively @xcite .",
    "these values are about two orders of magnitude higher than in large cold nuclei @xcite .    given such large values of the jet transport parameter , the energy lost to the medium by a propagating parton is also very large .",
    "dissipation of this large amount of lost energy in the medium can lead to jet - induced medium excitations such as supersonic waves or mach cones @xcite .",
    "study of such jet - induced medium excitations can shed light on the transport properties of the bulk medium which complements that obtained from analyses of anisotropic flows due to collective expansion .",
    "several types of models can be employed to study jet - induced medium excitations such as hydrodynamical models @xcite , string theory @xcite and parton transport models @xcite .",
    "the linear boltzmann transport ( lbt ) model @xcite combines a kinetic description of parton propagation and hydrodynamic description of the underlying medium evolution .",
    "since it also keeps track of thermal recoil partons from each scattering and their further propagation in the medium , the lbt model can be used to study both jet transport in medium and jet - induced medium excitations .",
    "jet - induced medium excitations in the form of thermal recoil partons and their further propagation are also important for the study of jet quenching through reconstructed jets and the corresponding jet profiles . reconstructed jets defined through a jet - finding algorithm @xcite in experiments are collections of collimated showers of hadrons within a jet cone . neglecting nonperturbative effects through hadronization ,",
    "jets reconstructed through jet shower partons and final hadrons are equivalent and have approximately the same energy .",
    "since interaction in pqcd between an energetic parton and the thermal medium is dominated by small - angle scatterings , a large fraction of thermal recoil partons from jet - medium interaction fall within the jet cone and therefore should become a part of the reconstructed jet .",
    "these thermal recoil partons within the jet cone can contribute to a non - negligible fraction of the total jet energy and modify both the jet transverse profile ( transverse energy distribution inside the jet cone ) and fragmentation functions ( particle distributions in longitudinal momentum inside the jet cone ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , a diffusion wake generated behind a propagating parton effectively modifies the underlying fluid background and therefore also affects jet reconstruction , the final jet energy , and the jet profile .",
    "these effects can all be studied within the lbt model and are important for understanding the medium modified jet cross section and jet profiles @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we describe in detail the lbt model that has been developed over the last few years and improvements to the early versions that have been used for the study of jet - induced medium excitations @xcite , jet transport , and medium modifications @xcite .",
    "we also employ the model to study elastic energy loss through multiple scattering , propagation of jet - induced medium excitations , and their contributions to parton distribution and jet profiles of reconstructed jets using the anti-@xmath7 algorithm in fastjet @xcite .    instead of using the small - angle approximation for parton scatterings in the early versions of the lbt model",
    ", we have included the complete set of @xmath8  elastic \" parton scattering processes with full scattering matrix elements including large - angle scatterings , annihilation processes , and flavor conversion .",
    "these are necessary for more accurate description of parton transport in medium .",
    "simulations of parton transport according to the boltzmann equation in the lbt model are based on local rates of scattering in a medium that evolves according to relativistic hydrodynamic equations .",
    "we keep track of medium recoil partons from each parton - medium scattering and neglect interactions among jet shower partons and thermal recoil partons , wherein lies the meaning of  linear \" in lbt .",
    "the model is therefore lorentz covariant and can avoid difficulties of implementing the test - particle method in a full - fledged parton transport model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it also allows us to study jet transport and jet - induced medium excitations based on event - by - event simulations with full fluctuations and correlations .",
    "this article is devoted to a general description and test of elastic scatterings in the lbt model and the corresponding jet transport and jet - induced medium excitations in a uniform qgp medium .",
    "the final medium modification of jets and the effect of jet - induced medium excitations will depend strongly on the inelastic parton - medium scatterings and the dynamical expansion of the medium . these will be described in the future when we carry out realistic studies of jet transport and medium modification in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",

    "transverse momentum distributions of both leading partons and reconstructed jets are shown to have a power law tail underneath gaussian distributions from multiple scattering .",
    "these power law tails come from a single large angle parton - medium scattering during the jet propagation .",
    "study of these power law tails in heavy - ion collisions can shed light on the microscopic nature of the qgp medium at different scales .    for a realistic description of jet transport in the qgp medium in high - energy heavy - ion collisions",
    ", we will have to implement inelastic processes such as gluon bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton - medium scattering @xcite and couple lbt monte carlo simulations with bulk medium evolutions from 3 + 1d hydrodynamic model calculations , which should be constrained by bulk hadron spectra from existing experimental data .",
    "these parts of the lbt model and the phenomenological study of jet suppression in heavy - ion collisions will be discussed in subsequent publications .",
    "we thank wei chen for helpful discussions , in particular on the elliptic paraboloid shape of the shock wave induced by a propagating parton .",
