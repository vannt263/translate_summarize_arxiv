    "the mellin  barnes approach has proven to be a versatile and successful approach to evaluating higher - loop integrals , both analytically and numerically  @xcite .",
    "its early successes included the analytic computation of the planar  @xcite and nonplanar  @xcite two - loop double - box integrals . in this approach ,",
    "one first introduces a feynman parametrization into loop integrals , performs the loop integrals , and then uses mellin ",
    "barnes representations for the integrands to allow the feynman parameter integrals to be computed .",
    "the integrals are typically infrared - divergent , and may have ultraviolet divergences as well .",
    "these divergences are usually regulated dimensionally ; the resulting singularities are hidden inside the integrands of the mellin ",
    "barnes integrals .",
    "one can move the contours to make these singularities manifest , yielding a representation in which the poles in the regulator @xmath0 are manifest , and in which the coefficients are finite mellin  barnes integrals which can be computed analytically or numerically .",
    "czakon s package  @xcite automated the process of moving contours to resolve singularities ; a related algorithm was later implemented in by smirnov and smirnov  @xcite .",
    "other publicly available packages connected with the mellin  barnes evaluation of feynman integrals are available on the webpage  @xcite :  @xcite , which assists in creating mellin  barnes representations ;  @xcite , which performs parametric expansions of mellin  barnes integrals ; and  @xcite , which automates the application of barnes lemmas .    the mellin ",
    "barnes approach has been used extensively for numerical cross - checks of analytic results in the euclidean region , including in two - loop massive bhabha scattering in qed  @xcite ; in three - loop massless form factors  @xcite and static potentials  @xcite ; in massive two - loop qcd form - factors  @xcite ; in @xmath1-physics studies  @xcite ; in hadronic top - quark physics  @xcite ; and for angular integrations in phase - space integrals  @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to obtain direct numerical results in computations in supersymmetric yang - mills theories : for the four - loop cusp anomalous dimension  @xcite and two - loop five - point amplitudes  @xcite ; as well as in @xmath2 chern  simons theory at six loops and beyond  @xcite . very recently",
    ", it has been applied to integrals in chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .    the and packages yield numerically convergent integrals in the euclidean region for integrals arising from a mixture of massless and massive propagators .",
    "the same integrals are typically only conditionally convergent in the minkowski region , and hence fail to converge numerically . for feynman integrals that arise at one loop",
    ", one can ultimately perform the integrations analytically , and assemble these results into numerical software libraries  @xcite .",
    "the convergence failure is then an annoyance , and prevents use of numerical approaches as cross checks , but it is not a critical problem .    at two loops and beyond , not all desired integrals are available analytically , and the obstruction is of greater importance . a variety of other techniques can be applied to the numerical calculation of feynman integrals in the minkowski region .",
    "these include sector decomposition  @xcite ( as implemented , for example , in  @xcite and  @xcite ) ; numerical subtraction of singularities in loop - momentum space  @xcite , along with appropriate complex contour deformations of the feynman - parameter integrations .",

    "barnes integrals produced by the and packages use standard contours , parallel to the imaginary axis .",
    "the representation was re - examined by freitas and huang  @xcite , who pointed out that using tilted contours of integration different from the textbook contours chosen by can make minkowski - region massive integrals convergent .",
    "these authors did not specify exactly how these tilted linear contours should be chosen . a recent mellin ",
    "barnes based numerical package ,  @xcite , takes a different approach , shifting and rotating contours , re - mapping integrands , and dropping small contributions to compute multi - dimensional integrals with multiple scales in the minkowski region  @xcite .",
    "it has been applied to the two - loop bosonic contributions to @xmath3  @xcite .    in this article , we re - examine the choice of contours , and show how to detemine contours that are in a certain sense close approximations to optimal contours of integration .",
    "we study one - dimensional mellin ",
    "barnes integrals both in the euclidean and minkowski regions .",
    "our contours improve the numerical efficiency of computation in the former region , and provide an efficient and convergent representation in the latter .",
    "we also present a connection to the tilted contours suggested by freitas and huang  @xcite .",
    "while these contours are not computationally optimal , they do have the virtue of simplicity .",
    "we believe that the approach described here will generalize to higher - dimensional mellin  barnes integrals ; but the generalization is not trivial nor completely straightforward , and accordingly we postpone any discussion of it to future work .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we study an example of a one - dimensional massive integral in the euclidean region .",
    "we also discuss the differential equation drawn from the mathematics literature which determines an exact contour of stationary phase . in , we present several approximations to the exact contour , for parameter values in the euclidean region . in ,",
    "we show how to match contours to their asymptotic forms , and in , we give examples of various use cases exemplifying the utility of using approximate contours and matching to their asymptotic forms .",
    "we use as examples integrals that may arise in feynman diagrams . in ,",
    "we study approximations to contours of stationary phase for parameters in the minkowski region . in",
    ", we examine one important special case , of integrals with no stationary point along the real axis even for parameters in the euclidean region . in , we examine briefly the evaluation of integrals using the various contour approximations discussed in earlier sections . we give some concluding remarks in .",
    "let us begin by studying mellin ",
    "barnes integrals in the euclidean region . in this region ,",
    "the standard contours used in the definition of the integrals  as well as by the package  are usually suitable for numerical integration as well .",
    "but we can improve upon them , and the improvements offer a stepping stone to the modifications required to obtain a numerically convergent form in the minkowski region .",
    "we begin with a one - dimensional integral , @xmath4 where @xmath5 this integral was considered in refs .  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned there , it can be evaluated analytically , with result , @xmath6 in the euclidean region @xmath7 ; @xmath8 below threshold ( @xmath9 $ ] ) in the minkowski region ; and , @xmath10\\ , , \\label{int1abovethreshold}\\ ] ] above threshold .",
    "( the forms in correspond to when @xmath11 is given a small imaginary part . )     of for @xmath12 along the ` textbook ' ( and ) contour , @xmath13 . ]    in the euclidean region , @xmath7 , and hence the integrand is real for real @xmath14 .",
    "the reflection symmetry",
    "@xmath15 then ensures the integral is real as well .",
    "the package , left to its own devices , will choose @xmath16 .",
    "let us consider the integral for @xmath12 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the integrand along the contour are shown in .",
    "both oscillate around zero , though the oscillations are damped as one moves away from the real axis , and the resulting numerical integral converges nicely .",
    "( obtaining the vanishing result for the imaginary part does require non - trivial cancellations in a numerical integration , of course . )    nonetheless , let us ask : why choose this particular contour ? or , more pointedly : can we do any better ?",
    "is there a more efficient contour ?     of with @xmath12 , with contours for phases @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 also shown .",
    "the contour with phase 0 is the boundary between the darkest and lightest shade . ]",
    "complex - analysis textbooks would tell us that the answer is yes : we should choose the contour of steepest descent .",
    "this will yield the most - rapidly convergent integral , because it is also a contour of stationary phase and hence minimizes oscillations in the integrand . shows a variety of contours of stationary phase for the integrand @xmath21 ; in the case at hand , we should pick the contour of phase 0 . as in the case of parton - distribution evolution  @xcite",
    ", we must face the questions of whether we can find a good approximation to this contour without undue computational effort ; and whether we can easily adapt the contour to different values of the parameter @xmath11 . as we shall see",
    ", we can provide affirmative answers to both questions .",
    "our first task in finding the contour of stationary phase in this case is to find a local minimum along the real axis .",
    "the minimum closest to @xmath22 is given by the solution to , @xmath23 which is at @xmath24 for @xmath12 . because we have the analytic form of the integrand",
    ", we can easily obtain this equation analytically , and then use an efficient algorithm ( e.g. newton  raphson ) to find a numerical solution .    before looking at a sequence of approximations to the desired contour ,",
    "let us examine the exact contour @xmath25 , anchored at the above minimum . in the present case , @xmath26 will vanish exactly along the contour .",
    "we seek contours described by a meromorphic function ; and @xmath27 itself is meromorphic as well .",
    "the contour then satisfies a differential equation  @xcite , @xmath28 the phase of @xmath27 is given by @xmath29 ; along a contour satisfying , the phase does not vary , @xmath30 \\\\ & = \\frac1{2i } \\biggl [ \\frac{\\partial\\ln f_1}{\\partial z}\\frac{dz}{dt } -\\overline{\\frac{\\partial\\ln f_1}{\\partial z}}\\frac{d\\zbar}{dt } \\biggr ] \\\\ & = -\\frac1{2i } \\biggl [ \\frac{\\partial\\ln f_1}{\\partial z }     \\overline{\\frac{\\partial \\ln f_1}{\\partial z } } -\\overline{\\frac{\\partial\\ln f_1}{\\partial z } }     \\frac{\\partial \\ln f_1}{\\partial z } \\biggr ] \\\\ & = 0\\ , .",

    "the stationary point @xmath32 is also a stationary point of this equation ; a solution which starts at @xmath32 will stay there for all @xmath33 . as boundary data for the differential equation",
    ", we must therefore choose a different point . a suitable choice is given by perturbing away from @xmath32 along one of the two directions of steepest descent .",
    "in general , one can find these by finding the eigenvectors of the hessian of the integrand ; in this case , the required directions are parallel to the imaginary axis , in either the positive and negative direction .",
    "one can then solve the equation numerically ; one must do so separately in the upper- and lower - half planes .",
    "( alternatively , in the euclidean region the lower half - plane contour will be the complex conjugate of the upper half - plane contour . ) the pair of contours together is called the lefschetz thimble @xmath34 associated to the stationary point @xmath32 .    in the case at hand ,",
    "one starts with @xmath32 as given by the solution to , and looks for the tangent to it . for euclidean values of @xmath11 , the line",
    "@xmath35 will be that tangent , because a minimum along the real axis is a saddle point of the integrand in the complex plane .",
    "we can perturb away from the stationary point along the tangent , @xmath36 in order to obtain a suitable starting point for the differential equation .",
    "( the smaller @xmath37 , the more accurate the solution will be . ) we make use of the _ mathematica _ routine ndsolve to solve the differential equation   with starting points @xmath38 .",
    "this yields a numerical representation of the exact contour of stationary phase .",
    "we show examples of exact contours in following sections .    in general",
    ", however , solving the differential equation  ( [ differentialequation ] ) , and then using the solution repeatedly in a numerical integration , may be computationally expensive .",
    "furthermore , we may encounter integrals for which the exact contour of stationary phase is not optimal for numerical integration , and where the mb integral would require special treatment with an exact contour .",
    "this motivates us to seek approximations to the exact contour of stationary phase , which we consider in the next section .",
    "of for @xmath12 along the contour @xmath39 , tangent to the contour of steepest descent . ]    the simplest approximation to the exact contour of stationary phase is given by a straight line tangent to it .",
    "as noted in the previous section , the line @xmath35 will be that tangent .",
    "if we take our contour to be this line , we see that while the integrand still oscillates ( see ) , the oscillations are damped more quickly than along the original contour .",
    "we can improve on the tangent approximation ; to find a better approximation , we follow the same procedure as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "parametrize @xmath40 , choosing @xmath41 if we require the contour to be symmetric under reflection in the real axis ( as is desirable for numerical evaluation ) , @xmath42 will be an even function , and @xmath43 an odd one .",
    "we can rescale @xmath33 to make @xmath44 . taking the contour to be smooth",
    ", we will also have @xmath45 .",
    "the expansion of the integrand around @xmath46 then takes the form , @xmath47 where we drop the @xmath11 argument for brevity .",
    "as all derivatives of @xmath48 are real , the equation @xmath49 is satisfied to this order ; and as @xmath50 is positive , the integrand decreases with @xmath33",
    ". however , the contour will not continue parallel to the imaginary axis ; to see where it goes , we must expand to higher order .",
    "consider the expansion to @xmath51 , @xmath52 to this order , the stationary - phase condition ( @xmath53 ) requires , @xmath54 in the neighborhood of @xmath32 , the approximate contour then has the form , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is real , and given by , @xmath57 because @xmath58 vanishes , the terms of @xmath59 are automatically real , and only at @xmath60 do imaginary terms now appear in the expansion of @xmath61 .

    "barnes integrals @xmath62 ( [ onedimensionalexample ] ) and @xmath63 ( [ noextremumintegral ] ) using both the contour chosen by , as well as the tangent and pad contours , all using the gsl routines mentioned earlier , as well as an evaluation using the pad contour and the gauss - legendre approach . in the euclidean region , the pad contour provides a more efficient evaluation , especially within the gauss - legendre approach . in the minkowski region",
    ", it is again more efficient where other contours can be used , and provides a reliable means of evaluating the integrals even when linear contours fail to provide a numerically convergent result .",
    "in this paper , we have re - examined the numerical evaluation of mellin  barnes integrals .",
    "contours chosen by the or packages are not always suitable for numerical evaluation . using contours of stationary phase , or approximations thereto ,",
    "resolves problems that arise in numerical evaluation .",
    "we discussed the computation of exact contours of stationary descent for one - dimensional integrals , as well as several approximations which are likely of greater practical importance .",
    "the [ 3/2 ] pad approximations  ( [ padecontour],[padecontourm],[extremumfreepade ] ) to contours of stationary phase are likely to be the most robust and widely useful of these approximations .",
