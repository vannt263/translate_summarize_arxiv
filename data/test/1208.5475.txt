    "classically , unsorted database are searched by inspecting each element and checking if they satisfy the desired property . if @xmath1 is the size of the database and @xmath2 is the number of target items , then the time complexity of obtaining the one of the desired element is @xmath3 . in @xcite ,",
    "grover introduced a quantum search algorithm which can speed up the process to @xmath4 operations . a proof that grover s search algorithm is the best possible oracle based search algorithm was developed in @xcite .",
    "the generality of the search based problem makes grover s algorithm one of the interesting field of research in quantum computing .",
    "some research are focused on its application @xcite , while others on its extension @xcite .",
    "one notable property of the quantum search algorithm is its oscillatory nature , i.e. the probability of finding one of the target states oscillates from zero to some maximum value . the number of queries that will give the maximum probability of success is dependent on the number of target states in the database @xcite . searching a quantum database using grover s algorithm without a prior knowledge of the number of target items",
    "poses a problem because the probability of finding a target state successfully does not converge as the number of iterations is increased .",
    "several modifications were proposed to address this dilemma @xcite which , however , can not preserve the @xmath3 signature . an alternative way of solving the problem is proposed in @xcite where the quantum search algorithm is damped by attaching an external spin to the quantum database . in this new scheme ,",
    "knowledge of the number of target items in the database is not needed .",
    "in the damped quantum search algorithm @xcite there exists a critical damping parameter which is introduced using a physical argument .",
    "the critical damping parameter suppresses the oscillations and the error probability from increasing . by simulating the behavior of the critical damping parameter ,",
    "the author was able to propose a damping parameter which varies with each iteration .",
    "the results were then able to suppress the oscillation of the success probability as the search approaches one of the target states .    in this work",
    ", we obtained the optimized damping parameter up to the tenth iteration by calculating the failure probability .",
    "this was done by solving the absolute minima of the failure probability for a given number of target states and database size as a function of the damping parameter per iteration .",
    "we also examined the critical damping parameter by comparing it with the optimized one .",
    "the goal of this work is to analyze if the critical damping is optimized .",
    "we will do this by directly probing the behavior of the probability of obtaining the target state as the number of target states is increased .",
    "suppose we have a total number of states @xmath1 , out of which @xmath2 are target states .",
    "let @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the equal superposition of the non - target states , @xmath7 is the equal superposition of the target states and @xmath8 .",
    "the action of the grover s algorithm is encapsulated in the operator @xmath9 . for a detailed discussion of the grover s algorithm",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the damped quantum search introduced in @xcite modified the grover formulation as follows .",
    "first , an external spin @xmath10 is appended to the initial state @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath12 ) .",
    "then , the following operator is introduced @xmath13 \\left[e^{-i\\phi s_{y}}\\frac{1-z}{2}+\\frac{1+z}{2}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the external pauli spin matrices acting in the hilbert space of the externally appended spin , the oracle @xmath16 acts on the hilbert space of the database and @xmath17 is the damping parameter .",
    "the action of @xmath18 is described as follows : ( i ) the right factor calls the oracle @xmath19 and flips the external spin if @xmath20 , ( ii ) the left factor utilizes @xmath9 only if the external spin has not flipped . in this way ,",
    "the external spin limits the application of @xmath9 as the target state is reached .",
    "each application of @xmath18 is followed by a measurement of the external spin .",
    "if the external spin has flipped , then the iteration stops . without knowing the measurement result , the system composite density matrix assumes the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is initially @xmath23 .",
    "this means that the probability that the system will collapse to @xmath24 , i.e. the target state has been found and the external spin has flipped , is @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , each iteration yields the following : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28^{t}=[\\sin\\theta\\;\\cos\\theta\\;1]^{t}$ ] .",
    "the combination of u and the measurement of the external spin increases @xmath25 as the number of iterations is increased .",
    "the average number of oracle queries to find the target item for small @xmath17 has the quantum search signature @xmath29 , while for @xmath30 , it takes an average of @xmath31 queries , which is the classical search limit .",
    "the existence of a critical damping defined by @xmath32 divides the two regimes . when @xmath33 , the three eigenvalues of the square matrix in eq .",
    "[ eq : mat ] are equal .",
    "it turns out that even for the weakest possible value of @xmath17 , where @xmath2 is set to 1 for arbitrary @xmath1 , the damping is still evident .",
    "however , this smallest value of @xmath17 can only damp the search effectively if @xmath34 . in the absence of the knowledge of @xmath2 and in case @xmath35 , the critical damping varies from iteration to iteration according to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 corresponds to the @xmath38 iteration .",
    "this proposed variation of @xmath17 starts with the largest damping and weakens with increasing number of iterations .",
    "this variation is designed to mimic the behavior of the critical damping .",
    "given the size of the database @xmath1 and the damping parameter @xmath17 , we execute @xmath40 calls to @xmath18 .",
    "the transition of the external spin from @xmath10 to @xmath41 indicates that the target has been found .",
    "however , if the external spin remains unaltered then we perform an additional query to the oracle to check if the target has been found .",
    "if the outcome turns out to be negative , then we start the procedure all over again .",
    "[ fig : fig2_refined ] shows the minimum expected number of calls before success , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the probability of success after the @xmath44 call as given by @xmath45    the linear behavior in the region of large damping parameter portrays the classical result , while the region of small damping parameter shows the quadratic quantum character .",
    "the valley separating these two regimes is interpreted as the region that has the critical damping , @xmath46 , based from the eigenvalues of the square matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mat ] ) .",
    "we analyze the distinct valley to determine if @xmath46 is the same as the damping parameter that gives the smallest possible @xmath47 .",
    "we refer to this as the _ optimum damping _ , @xmath48 .",
    "to start with our analysis , let us define a positive number that serves as an upper bound to the probability that the external spin has not flipped , such that @xmath49 we call @xmath50 the _ failure tolerance_.    suppose we perform @xmath40 iterations , what is the smallest possible failure tolerance , @xmath51 , that we can assign ?",
    "what is the value of the damping parameter @xmath52 that will give a @xmath51 ? is the computed @xmath48 the same as the @xmath46 ? in order to address these questions , we calculate @xmath47 as a function of @xmath53 and @xmath17 after a particular number of iterations via eq .",
    "( [ eq : mat ] ) .    to obtain the value of the damping parameter that will give @xmath51 , we take the derivative of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath17 and set the resulting expression to zero .",
    "we then compare the behavior of the obtained damping parameter @xmath52 with that of @xmath46 by plotting them both as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "replace the trace matrix of eq .   by @xmath54^{t}$ ] .",
    "we will get a column matrix with @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath47 as the first , second and third entry of the final column matrix .",
    "this process will yield @xmath47 for the first iteration @xmath57 where @xmath58 . for a given @xmath53",

    "the calculation of @xmath48 for @xmath70 iterations is carried out numerically as described in the following .",
    "the explicit forms of @xmath47 as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath53 for different iterations are calculated by taking the @xmath44 power of eq . and choosing the third entry after the resulting square matrix is pre - multiplied by @xmath28^{t}=[\\sin\\theta\\;\\cos\\theta\\;1]^{t}$ ] .",

    "the behavior of @xmath48 in each iteration is analyzed by plotting it as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "this method is limited in a sense that the result will depend largely on the resolution of the grid .",

    "[ fig : phi ] for convenience .",
    "the results show that for any number of iterations the critical damping is equal to the optimized damping parameter in the region near @xmath75 , indicating that the critical damping is optimized for a target with a size comparable to that of the database .",
