    "for the past several decades since the discovery of pulsars , many authors have investigated the properties of dense matter which exist inside neutron stars and supernova cores ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "these objects have been shown that they consist of a variety of material phases whose physical properties reflect in many astrophysical phenomena of these objects . especially , the properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions , which is one of the essential topics for understanding the mechanism of collapse - driven supernovae @xcite , the structure of neutron star crusts @xcite and its relating phenomena , have been studied actively .",
    "this subject is also interesting as one of the fundamental problems of the complex fluids of nucleons .    at subnuclear densities",
    ", nuclear matter exhibits the coexistence of a liquid phase with a gas phase due to the internucleon interaction which has an attractive part . at sufficiently low temperatures relevant to neutron star interiors , and sufficiently below the normal nuclear density ,",
    "long - range coulomb interactions make the system divide periodically into gas and spherical liquid drops , adding a crystalline property to the liquid - gas coexistence .    in the density region",
    "where nuclei are about to melt into uniform matter , it is expected that the energetically favorable configuration of the mixed phase possesses interesting spatial structures such as rodlike and slablike nuclei and rodlike and spherical bubbles , etc . , which are referred to as nuclear `` pasta '' .",
    "this picture was originally proposed by ravenhall et al .",
    "@xcite and hashimoto et al .",
    "@xcite independently .",
    "their predictions both based on free energy calculations with liquid drop models assuming some specific nuclear shapes .",
    "these works clarify that the most energetically stable nuclear shape is determined by a subtle balance between the nuclear surface and coulomb energies .",
    "detailed aspects of equilibrium phase diagrams , such as a series of nuclear shapes which can be realized as the energetically most favorable and the density range corresponding to the phases with nonspherical nuclei , vary with nuclear models @xcite .",
    "however , the realization of the `` pasta '' phases as energy minimum states can be seen in a wide range of nuclear models and the phase diagrams possess an universal basic feature that , with increasing density , the shape of the nuclear matter region changes like  sphere @xmath4 cylinder @xmath4 slab @xmath4 cylindrical hole @xmath4 spherical hole @xmath4 uniform @xcite .",
    "this feature is also reproduced by the thomas - fermi calculations by several groups @xcite .",
    "the phases with these exotic nuclear structures , if they were realized in neutron star crusts or supernova cores , bring about many astrophysical consequences . as for those in neutron star phenomena , it is interesting to note the relevance of nonspherical nuclei to pulsar glitches and cooling of neutron stars .",
    "although the question whether the mechanism of pulsar glitches is depicted by vortex pinning model or star quake model has yet to be settled completely , the existence of nonspherical nuclei in neutron star matter ( nsm ) have significant effects in both cases . as for the former , while the force needed to pin vortices has yet to be clarified completely even for a bcc lattice of spherical nuclei mainly due to the uncertain properties of impurities and defects @xcite , the effect of spatial structure of normal nuclear matter on vortex dynamics can not be ignored . as for the latter , the existence of `` pasta '' phases with slablike and rodlike nuclei would change the elastic properties of inner crust matter from those of crystalline solid to those of liquid crystal as indicated by pethick and potekhin @xcite , which results in significant decrease of the maximum elastic energy that can be stored in the inner crust .",
    "the presence of nonspherical nuclei would also accelerate the cooling of the corresponding region of neutron stars by opening semileptonic weak processes which are unlikely to occur for spherical nuclei @xcite .",
    "`` pasta '' phases in supernova matter ( snm ) are expected to affect the neutrino transport and hydrodynamics in supernova cores .",
    "let us first note that the neutrino wavelengths , typically of order 20 fm , are comparable to or even greater than the internuclear spacing , leading to diffractive effects on the neutrino elastic scattering off such a periodic spatial structure of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "these effects , induced by the internuclear coulombic correlations , would reduce the scattering rates and hence the lepton fraction @xmath5 . for the bcc lattice of spherical nuclei ,",
    "such a reduction was examined by horowitz @xcite by calculating the associated static structure factor .",
    "it is also noteworthy that nonspherical nuclei and bubbles are elongated in specific direction . in such direction ,",
    "the neutrino scattering processes are no longer coherent , in contrast to the case of roughly spherical nuclei whose finiteness in any direction yields constructive interference in the scattering .",
    "the final point to be mentioned is that the changes in the nuclear shape are accompanied by discontinuities in the adiabatic index , denoting how hard the equation of state of the material is .",
    "these discontinuities may influence the core hydrodynamics during the initial phase of the collapse @xcite .",
    "though the properties of `` pasta '' phases in equilibrium state have been investigated actively , the formation and the melting processes of these phases have not been discussed except for some limited cases which are based on perturbative approaches @xcite .",
    "it is important to adopt a microscopic and dynamical approach which allows arbitrary nuclear structures in order to understand these processes of nonspherical nuclei . at finite temperatures",
    ", it is considered that not only nuclear surface becomes obscure but also nuclei of various shapes may coexist .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to incorporate density fluctuations without any assumptions on nuclear shape to investigate the properties of `` pasta '' phases at finite temperatures .",
    "although the works done by williams and koonin @xcite and lassaut et al .",
    "@xcite do not assume nuclear structure , they can not incorporate fluctuations of nucleon distributions in a satisfying level because they are based on the thomas - fermi calculation , which is one - body approximation .",
    "in addition , only a single structure is contained in the simulation box in these works , there are thus possibilities that nuclear shape is strongly affected by boundary effect and some structures are prohibited implicitly .    in the present work , we study the structure of cold dense matter at subnuclear densities in the framework of quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite , which is one of the molecular dynamics ( md ) approaches for nucleon many - body systems ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for review ) .",
    "md for nucleons including qmd , which is a microscopic and dynamical method without any assumptions on nuclear structure , is suitable for incorporating fluctuations of particle distributions .",
    "previously , we have reported the first results of our study on nuclear `` pasta '' by qmd , which demonstrated that the `` pasta '' phases can be formed in a dynamical way for matter with proton fractions @xmath6 and 0.5 @xcite . in this full paper",
    ", we present new results for astrophysically interesting neutron - rich matter of @xmath7 in addition to the cases of @xmath6 and 0.5 reported before .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the framework of the qmd model used in the present study .",
    "we then show the results of our simulations in section iii and analyze the structure of matter obtained by the simulations using two - point correlation functions and minkowski functionals in section iv . in section",
    "v , we investigate the properties of the effective nuclear interaction used in this work in order to examine the validity of our results in terms of nuclear forces .",
    "astrophysical discussions are given in section vi .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in section vii .",
    "we have various types of molecular dynamics methods for nucleons including representative ones such as fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) @xcite , antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite and qmd , etc . in the present work , we choose qmd among them balancing between calculation cost and accuracy .",
    "the typical length scale @xmath8 of inter - structure is @xmath9 fm and the density region of interest is just below the normal nuclear density @xmath10 .",
    "the required nucleon number @xmath11 in order to reproduce @xmath12 unit structures in the simulation box is about @xmath13 ( for slabs ) .",
    "it is thus desirable that we prepare nucleons of order 10000 if we try to reduce boundary effects down to a satisfactory level by reproducing several several unit structures in the box . while it is a hard task to treat such a large system with , for example , fmd and amd whose calculation costs scale as @xmath14 , it is feasible to do it with qmd whose calculation costs scale as @xmath15 .",
    "this difference comes from summations in the slater determinants in the trial wave functions of the former models . in qmd ,",
    "on the other hand , the total @xmath11-nucleon wave function @xmath16 is assumed to be a direct product of single - nucleon states @xmath17 : @xmath18 the single - nucleon state is represented by a gaussian wave packet : @xmath19}\\ , \\label{packet}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the centers of position and momentum of the packet @xmath22 , respectively , and @xmath23 is a parameter related to the extension of the wave packet in the coordinate space .",
    "it is also noted that we mainly focus on the macroscopic structures ; the exchange effect would not be so important for them .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the typical values of the exchange energy for the macroscopic scale and of the energy difference between two successive phases with nonspherical nuclei .",
    "suppose there are two identical nucleons , @xmath24 and 2 , bound in different nuclei each other .",
    "the exchange energy between these particles is calculated as an exchange integral : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the potential energy .",
    "an asymptotic form of the wave function is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the binding energy and @xmath31 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the exchange integral reads @xmath32 } \\sim 5 \\times 10^{-6 } { \\rm mev}\\ ] ] for the internuclear distance @xmath33 fm and @xmath34 mev , which is extremely smaller than the typical energy difference per nucleon between the `` pasta '' phases of order 0.1 kev ( for nsm , see fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) - 10 kev ( for snm , see fig .  4 in ref .",
    "therefore , it is expected that qmd , which is less elaborate in treating the exchange effect , is not bad approximation for investigating the nuclear `` pasta '' .",
    "consequently , qmd has the advantages over the other models in the present study . in the future",
    ", we will have to confirm the validity of the results obtained by qmd using other more elaborate model such as amd or fmd to treat the exchange effect more precicely . however",
    ", this problem is beyond the scope of the present work .      to simulate nuclear matter at subnuclear densities within the framework of qmd",
    ", we use a qmd model hamiltonian developed by maruyama et al .",
    "@xcite , which is constructed so as to reproduce bulk properties of nuclear matter and properties of finite nuclei .",
    "this model hamiltonian consists of the following six terms @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the kinetic energy , @xmath37 is the pauli potential introduced to reproduce the pauli principle effectively , @xmath38 is the skyrme potential which consists of an attractive two - body term and a repulsive three - body term , @xmath39 is the symmetry potential , @xmath40 is the momentum - dependent potential introduced as two fock terms of the yukawa interaction and @xmath41 is the coulomb potential .",

    "we here would like to mention the reasons of discrepancies between the present result and the result obtained by maruyama et al .",
    "which says `` the nuclear shape may not have these simple symmetries '' @xcite .",
    "one of the most crucial reasons seems to be the difference in treatment of the coulomb interaction . in the present simulation",
    ", we calculate the long range coulomb interaction in a consistent way using the ewald method . for the system of interest where the thomas - fermi screening length is comparable to or larger than the size of nuclei ,",
    "this treatment is more adequate than that which inctroduces an artificial cutoff distance as in ref .",
    "the other crucial reason is the difference in the relaxation time scales @xmath79 fm/@xmath70 ; we set @xmath80 in the present work , but maruyama et al .",
    "set @xmath81 several@xmath82 fm/@xmath70 @xcite . in our simulation",

    "however , the matter in the density region corresponding to a nucleus - phase is quenched in an amorphous - like state when @xmath85 fm/@xmath70 . in the present work ,",
    "we take @xmath79 much larger than typical time scale @xmath86 fm/@xmath70 for nucleons to thermally diffuse in the distance of @xmath9 fm at @xmath87 and @xmath88 mev .",
    "this temperature is lower than the typical value of the liquid - gas phase transition temperature in the density region of interest , it is thus considered that our results are thermally relaxed in a satisfying level .",
    "phase diagrams of matter in the ground state are shown in figs .",
    "[ phase diagram 1](a ) and ( b ) for @xmath78 0.5 and 0.3 , respectively . as can be seen from these figures ,",
    "the obtained phase diagrams basically reproduce the sequence of the energetically favored nuclear shapes predicted by simple discussions @xcite which only take account of the coulomb and surface effects ; this prediction is that the nuclear shape changes like  sphere @xmath4 cylinder @xmath4 slab @xmath4 cylindrical hole @xmath4 spherical hole @xmath4 uniform , with increasing density . comparing figs .  3 ( a ) and ( b ) , we can see that the phase diagram shifts towards the lower density side with decreasing @xmath89 , which is due to the tendency that the saturation density is lowered as the neutron excess increases .",
    "it is remarkable that the density dependence of the nuclear shape , except for spherical nuclei and bubbles , is quite sensitive and phases with intermediate nuclear shapes which are not simple as shown in figs . 1 and 2",
    "are observed in two density regions : one is between the cylinder phase and the slab phase , the other is between the slab phase and the cylindrical hole phase .",
    "we note that these phases are different from coexistence phases with nuclei of simple shapes , which will be referred to as `` intermediate phases '' .",
    "we have also performed qmd simulations of matter with proton fraction @xmath7 as a more realistic condition for the neutron star matter . in this case , we have to deal with a larger system than in the cases of @xmath0 and 0.3 because enough number of protons for reproducing several nuclei in a simulation box are required to obtain significant results ; protons play an important role in generating the long - range order due to their electric charge .",
    "we have investigated the neutron - rich matter at @xmath7 with 10976 nucleons , in which 1098 protons and 9878 neutrons are contained .",
    "following basically the same procedure that used for the cases of @xmath0 and 0.3 ( see section [ sim p - rich ] for detail ) , we tried to obtain the ground - state matter .",
    "however , in the present case , we quickly relax from the initial state at @xmath90 mev to the state at @xmath91 mev , at which matter is still uniform , with a nos - hoover - like thermostat @xcite which will be discussed in another paper @xcite .",
    "after the relaxation at @xmath91 mev for @xmath92 ",
    "7000 fm/@xmath70 , we then cool down the system with a relaxation time scale @xmath84 fm/@xmath70 using the qmd equations of motion with friction terms ( [ qmdeom fric ] ) .",
    "these simulations are performed by fujitsu vpp 5000 equipped with mdgrape-2 .",
    "some resultant nucleon distributions are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig sphere x0.1 ] and [ fig cylinder x0.1 ] , which correspond to the sphere phase and the cylinder phase , respectively .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig sphere x0.1 ] , dripped neutrons spread over the whole region in the simulation box , which lead to smaller density contrast compared with that for the cases of @xmath0 and 0.3 depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig pasta sym ] and [ fig pasta x0.3 ] , respectively .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath7 are summarized in the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phase diagram 2 ] .",
    "a striking feature is that the wide density region from @xmath93 to @xmath94 is occupied by an intermediate phase .",
    "the structure of matter seems to change rather continuously from that consists of branching rodlike nuclei connected to each other [ obtained in the lower density region of the intermediate phase denoted by ( c , u ) ] to that consists of branching bubbles connected to each other [ higher density region of the intermediate phase ( c , u ) ] .",
    "however , in the present neutron - rich case , `` pasta '' phase with slablike nuclei can not be obtained as far as we have investigated , which will be discussed at the end of the next section .",
    "it is also noted that the density at which matter turns into uniform is lower than those in the cases of @xmath0 and 0.3 , which is consistent with the tendency that matter becomes the more neutron - rich , the saturation density becomes the lower .",
    "to analyze the spatial distribution of nucleons , we calculate two - point correlation function @xmath95 for nucleon density field @xmath96 @xmath97 where @xmath11 stands for nucleons@xmath98 .",

    "[ corr x0.5 ] , [ corr x0.3 ] and [ corr x0.1 ] , respectively .",
    "we can see the general tendency , which is common for the different values of @xmath89 , that the amplitude of @xmath115 decreases with increasing the density .",
    "it is noted that even though the change in the amplitude of @xmath115 is quite noticeable , the smallest zero - point @xmath116 of @xmath115 takes similar values at various densities especially for @xmath0 and 0.3 .",
    "this feature means that the typical length scales of the nuclear structures , i.e. , the internuclear distance and the nuclear radius , keep comparable at subnuclear densities from @xmath117 to @xmath114 , which is consistent with the results obtained by the previous works ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "this behavior just below @xmath114 will be discussed further concerning a problem about the properties of the transition to uniform matter .",
    "we also note that a strong attractive force acting between a proton and a neutron leads to the good agreement of the zero - points of @xmath118 and @xmath119 even for @xmath6 and 0.1 as well as for @xmath0 although the zero - point @xmath120 of @xmath119 is @xmath121 fm ( @xmath122 fm ) larger than that of @xmath118 for @xmath6 ( 0.1 ) at each density .",
    "this shows that the phase of the density fluctuations of protons and neutrons correlate so strongly with each other at zero temperature that they almost coincide .",
    "as can be seen by comparing @xmath111 for different values of the proton fraction @xmath89 , the amplitude decreases and the value of the smallest zero - point @xmath120 increases with decreasing @xmath89 .",
    "this behavior means that , as matter becomes more neutron - rich , not only the nucleon density distribution gets smoother but also the spatial structure becomes larger .",
    "let us then examine @xmath95 for each value of the proton fraction .",
    "for symmetric matter ( @xmath0 ) , protons and neutrons are equivalent except for the mass difference and the coulomb interaction .",

    ", @xmath118 is slightly smaller than @xmath119 because the repulsive coulomb interaction among protons tends to reduce the proton density inhomogeneity especially in the smaller scale . for asymmetric matter ( @xmath6 and 0.1 ) , on the contrary",
    ", the amplitude of @xmath119 is much smaller than that of @xmath118 due to the dripped neutrons which distribute rather uniformly outside the nuclei .",
    "let us here examine the properties of the transition from the phase with spherical bubbles to uniform matter for @xmath0 .",
    "for this purpose , two - point correlation function of the nucleon density fluctuation is useful . in fig .",
    "[ corr2 melt ] , we thus plot the two - point correlation function of the nucleon density fluctuation @xmath111 for several densities around the melting density @xmath114 .",
    "to compute @xmath111 , we use a 1372-nucleon system cooled down until the temperature gets @xmath126 0.05 mev by qmd equations of motion ( [ qmdeom fric ] ) with friction terms .    for uniform phase",
    ", @xmath111 should be zero except for the contribution of short - range correlation .",
    "the behavior of @xmath111 shows that @xmath114 lies between 0.7@xmath127 and @xmath128 at @xmath0 [ see also fig .",
    "[ phase diagram 1](a ) ] above which long - range correlation disappears .",
    "it is noted that the smallest value of @xmath116 at which @xmath129 keeps around 8 fm even at densities just below @xmath114 .",
    "this means that , for @xmath0 , the phase with spherical bubbles whose radii are around @xmath120 suddenly disappear rather than they shrink gradually and the system turns into uniform with increasing the density because the quantity @xmath120 nearly corresponds to the half wave - length of the inhomogeneous density profile .",
    "the discontinuous change in the density profile indicates that the transition between the phase with spherical bubbles and the uniform phase is of first order .",

    "this is because , as @xmath66 increases , the dripped neutron gas becomes more inhomogeneous and tends to distribute close to the nuclear surface leading to a lower proton fraction in the nuclear matter regions .",
    "it is also noted that , as the nucleon density increases , the slope in the intermediate @xmath185 region changes from negative to positive at the density corresponding to the phase of slablike nuclei ( 0.4@xmath127 for @xmath0 and 0.35@xmath127 for @xmath6 ) , which is consistent with what is expected from the sign of @xmath157 for the nuclear surface [ see figs .  [ fig minko 2](a ) and [ fig minko 2](b ) ] .",

    "this shortcoming may result in favoring nuclei of smoothed simple shapes than in the real situation .",
    "* there is a strong possibility that some highly connected structures which have two or more substructures in a period are neglected in these works because only one structure is contained in a simulation box .",
    "it is not unnatural that the phases with highly connected nuclear and bubble regions are realized as the most energetically stable state @xcite .",
    "it is considered that , for example , a phase with perforated slablike nuclei , which has negative @xmath153 , could be more energetically stable than that with extremely thin slablike nuclei . the thin planar nucleus costs surface - surface energy which stems from the fact that nucleons bound in the nucleus feel its surfaces of both sides .",
    "the surface - surface energy brings about an extra energy increase in addition to the contribution of the surface energy .",
    "we have to examine the existence of the intermediate phases by more extensive simulations with larger nucleon numbers and with longer relaxation time scales in the future .      in the case of @xmath7 ,",
    "the criterion for identification of the isodensity surface corresponding to the nuclear surface using the second derivative of @xmath195 does not work at higher densities .",
    "we thus use another method to calculate the normalized minkowski functionals of the nuclear surface for @xmath7 .    in fig .",

    "we can see that this curve consists of three components : the peaks of the lower @xmath185 region , the plateau region and the peaks of the higher @xmath185 region , which are due to dripped neutrons ( thus these peaks can not be observed for @xmath0 ) , nuclear surfaces and nucleons in nuclei , respectively .",
    "these components can also be seen at the other values of @xmath66 lower than @xmath114 . however , we have to mention that the higher the density becomes , the smaller the plateau region gets , which means that the density contrast between the dripped neutron gas region and the nuclear matter region becomes obscure . here",

    "[ fig minko x0.1 ] .",
    "the error bars shown in this figure are the standard deviations of these quantities in the plateau region .",
    "consistency between this method and the one using the second derivative of @xmath195 has been confirmed for @xmath6 .",

    "the steep rise in @xmath1 in the higher neutron density region ( @xmath206 @xmath173 ) compared to those obtained from the hartree - fock theory using various skyrme interactions would help neutron - rich matter , which have larger dripped neutron density of @xmath206 @xmath173 , to be uniform .",

    "+ according to @xmath3 at @xmath237 , the present model is consistent with the other results , and is an appropriate effective interaction for the study of the `` pasta '' phases at @xmath0 . * for neutron - rich cases + for neutron - rich cases such as @xmath243 , in which the dripped neutron density @xmath240 grows @xmath244 @xmath173 just before matter turns into uniform",
    ", the present qmd model can be taken as a conservative one in reproducing the `` pasta '' phases .",
    "its @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 act to suppress the density region of the `` pasta '' phases compared to other skyrme - hartree - fock results . * for intermediate cases",
    "+ at intermediate proton fraction of @xmath245 , @xmath1 of the present model acts to favor the inhomogeneous `` pasta''phases rather than the uniform phase and @xmath3 acts in the opposite way in comparison with other skyrme - hartree - fock results .",
    "here we would like to discuss astrophysical consequences of our results .",
    "pethick and potekhin have pointed out that elastic properties of `` pasta '' phases with rodlike and slablike nuclei are similar to those of liquid crystals , which stems from the similarity in the geometrical structures @xcite .",
    "it can also be said that the intermediate phases observed in the present work are `` spongelike '' ( or `` rubberlike '' for @xmath246 ) phases because they have both highly connected nuclear and bubble regions shown as @xmath247 .",
    "the elastic properties of the spongelike intermediate phases are qualitatively different from those of the liquid - crystal - like `` pasta '' phases because the former ones do not have any directions in which the restoring force does not act ; while the latter ones have .",
    "our results imply that the intermediate phases occupy a significant fraction of the density region in which nonspherical nuclei can be seen ( see figs .",
    "[ phase diagram 1 ] and [ phase diagram 2 ] ) . according to figs .",
    "[ phase diagram 1 ] and [ phase diagram 2 ] , we expect that the maximum elastic energy that can be stored in the neutron star crust and supernova inner core is higher than that in the case where all nonspherical nuclei have simple `` pasta '' structures .",
    "besides , the cylinder and the slab phases , which are liquid - crystal - like , lie between the spongelike intermediate phases or the crystalline solidlike phase , and the releasing of the strain energy would , in consequence , concentrate in the domain of these liquid - crystal - like phases .",
    "the above effects of the intermediate phases should be taken into account in considering the crust dynamics of starquakes and hydrodynamics of the core collapse , etc . if these phases exist in neutron star matter and supernova matter . in the context of pulsar glitch phenomena ,",
    "the effects of the spongelike nuclei on the pinning rate and the creep velocity of superfluid neutron vortices also have yet to be investigated .    for neutrino cooling of neutron stars , some version of the direct urca process which is suggested by lorenz et al .",
    "@xcite , that this might be allowed in the `` pasta '' phases , would be suppressed in the intermediate phases .",
    "this is due to the fact that the proton spectrum at the fermi surface is no longer continuous in the spongelike nuclei .",
    "an important topic which we would like to mention is about the effects of the intermediate phases on neutrino trapping in supernova cores .",
    "the nuclear parts connect over a wide region which is much larger than that characterized by the typical neutrino wave length @xmath248 fm .",
    "thus the neutrino scattering processes are no longer coherent in contrast to the case of the spherical nuclei , and this may , in consequence , reduce the diffusion time scale of neutrinos as in the case of `` pasta '' phases with simple structures .",
    "this reduction softens the supernova matter and would thus act to enhance the amount of the released gravitational energy",
    ". it would be interesting to estimate the neutrino opacity of the spongelike phases and the `` pasta '' phases .",
    "finally , we would like to mention the thermal fluctuations with long wavelengths leading to displacements of `` pasta '' nuclei , which can not be incorporated into the simulations using a finite - size box . even if we succeed in reproducing the phase with slablike nuclei in neutron - rich matter in the future study",
    ", we should remind the above effect of thermal fluctuations to consider the real situation of matter in inner crusts of neutron stars . following the discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite by a liquid - drop model , it is likely that the extension of slablike nuclei is limited to a finite length scale of @xmath249 fm in the temperature regions typical for neutron star crusts and supernova cores .",
    "we have performed qmd simulations for matter with fixed proton fractions @xmath0 , 0.3 and 0.1 at various densities below the normal nuclear density . our calculations without any assumptions on the nuclear shape",
    "demonstrate that the `` pasta '' phases with rodlike nuclei , with slablike nuclei , with cylindrical bubbles and with spherical bubbles can be formed dynamically from hot uniform matter within the time scale of @xmath80 fm/@xmath70 in the proton - rich cases of @xmath0 and 0.3 .",
    "we also demonstrate that the `` pasta '' phase with cylindrical nuclei can be formed dynamically within the time scale of @xmath84 fm/@xmath70 for the neutron - rich case of @xmath7 .",
    "our results imply the existence of at least the phase with cylindrical nuclei in neutron star crusts because they cool down keeping the local thermal equilibrium after proto - neutron stars are formed and their cooling time scale , which is macroscopic one , is much larger than the relaxation time scale of our simulations .",
    "in addition to these `` pasta '' phases with simple structures , our results obtained here also suggest the existence of intermediate phases which have complicated nuclear shapes .",
    "we have systematically analyzed the structure of matter with two - point correlation functions and with morphological measures `` minkowski functionals '' , and have demonstrated how structure changes with increasing density . making use of a topological quantity called euler characteristic , which is one of the minkowski functionals",
    ", it has been found that the intermediate phases can be characterized as those with negative euler characteristic .",
    "this means that the intermediate phases have `` spongelike '' ( or `` rubberlike '' for @xmath246 ) structures which have both highly connected nuclear and bubble regions .",
    "the elastic properties of the spongelike intermediate phases are qualitatively different from those of the liquid - crystal - like `` pasta '' phases .",
    "we have also investigated the properties of the effective qmd interaction used in the present work in order to examine the validity of our results .",
    "important quantities which affect the structure of matter are the energy per nucleon @xmath1 of the pure neutron matter , the proton chemical potential @xmath2 in pure neutron matter and the nuclear surface tension @xmath3 . the resultant these quantities show that the present qmd interaction has generally reasonable properties at subnuclear densities among other nuclear interactions .",
    "it is thus concluded that our results are not exceptional ones in terms of nuclear forces .",
    "our results which suggest the existence of the highly connected intermediate phases as well as the simple `` pasta '' phases provide a vivid picture that matter in neutron star inner crusts and supernova inner cores has a variety of material phases .",
    "the stellar region which we have tried to understand throughout this paper is relatively tiny , but there has quite rich properties which stem from the fancy structures of dense matter .",

    "in calculating a long - range interaction , such as the coulomb interaction , it is necessary to sum up all contributions of particles at a sufficiently far distance .",
    "the ewald sum is a familiar technique for efficiently computing the long - range contributions in a system with the periodic boundary condition ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ; recent mathematically careful discussion relating to the conditionally convergence of the coulomb energy can be seen , e.g. , in ref .",
    "the basic idea of the ewald sum is that the contributions of particles in a long distance in real space can be calculated as contributions in the neighborhood in fourier space : the contributions of particles in a short distance is summed up in real space and those of particles in a long distance is summed up in fourier space .",
    "let us consider a system consisting of charged particles which have a gaussian charge distribution and a uniform background charge which cancels the total charge of charged particles .",
    "these @xmath11 particles are assumed to be in a cubic simulation box with volume @xmath250 which is imposed by the periodic boundary condition .    if every particle @xmath22 with total charge @xmath251 is surrounded by a gaussian charge distribution with total charge @xmath252 , the electrostatic interaction of particle @xmath22 turns into a screened short - range interaction .",
    "thus the total coulomb energy @xmath253 of this system can be decomposed into as follows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig ewald ] ) : @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the sum of the coulomb energy between an each unscreened charged particle @xmath22 and the other charged particles with screening charges , @xmath256 is that between an each unscreened charged particle @xmath22 and compensating charges which cancels the screening gaussian charges , and @xmath257 is the sum of spurious self interactions between an each charged particle @xmath22 and its compensating charge @xmath22 .",
    "charge densities of the real charged particles @xmath184 and of the screening charges @xmath258 can be written as @xmath259 where @xmath260 and @xmath261 are the reciprocals of the widths of charge distributions for a charged particle and a screening charge , respectively , and * n * denotes a position vector of a periodic image normalized by @xmath262 .",
    "thus a distribution of screened charges @xmath263 is @xmath264 the electrostatic potential @xmath265 due to @xmath266 can be obtained as      because a solution of the poisson equation @xmath268\\ ] ] is @xmath269 where erf(@xmath89 ) and erfc(@xmath89 ) are the error function and the complementary error function , respectively , and they are defined as @xmath270 and @xmath271 . here , we determine the constant @xmath272 so that the average value of @xmath273 in the simulation box @xmath154 be zero : @xmath274 thus , @xmath265 leads to              next , we calculate @xmath256 , which is the sum of the coulomb energy between an unscreened charged particle @xmath22 and a charge density @xmath281 which consists of the compensating charges and the background charge : @xmath282 fourier transforming the charge distribution @xmath281 yields @xmath283    using @xmath284 and the poisson equation @xmath285 in the fourier form @xmath286 we can at once obtain the electrostatic potential @xmath287 due to the charge density @xmath288 : @xmath289 the term with @xmath290 is canceled due to charge neutrality . thus the coulomb energy @xmath256 is given by @xmath291",
    "we have to subtract a sum of spurious self interactions @xmath292 between a charged particle @xmath22 and its compensating charge from @xmath256 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) , an electrostatic potential @xmath293 due to a gaussian compensating charge is @xmath294 , thus the self interaction of particle @xmath22 reads to @xmath295 and hence , @xmath296 finally , the total coulomb energy can be calculated by eqs .",
    "( [ coul ] ) , ( [ u_short ] ) , ( [ u1 ] ) and ( [ u_self ] ) . the positive background charge does not appear explicitly because the average value of @xmath273 within the simulation box is set to be zero .    the total coulomb energy per particle @xmath297 and the @xmath89 component of the coulomb force @xmath298 acting on a particle for various values of @xmath261 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig ewald ] . in this calculation",
    ", we use 1024 positive charged particles ( protons ) distributed randomly in a simulation box of @xmath299 fm ( i.e. @xmath300 ) , which is imposed of the periodic boundary condition . figs .",
    "[ fig ewald ] ( a ) and [ fig ewald ] ( b ) show the results for point charges and for gaussian charge distributions , respectively , which are calculated for the same configuration of the particle positions @xmath301 .",
    "the width of the gaussian charge distributions is set to be @xmath302 with @xmath303 @xmath235 , which corresponds to the width of the wave packets in the qmd model used in this work .",
    "we note that there are plateau regions of @xmath297 and @xmath298 whose values do not depend on @xmath261 .",
    "these constant values give results to be obtained .",
    "we note that the range of @xmath304 of the plateau regions become larger with increasing @xmath305 , where @xmath305 is the cutoff radius in the unit of @xmath306 for the summation in fourier space . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig ewald ] , @xmath261 dependences of @xmath297 and @xmath298 for the present qmd model with a finite width of the gaussian charge distributions are weaker than those for the point charges .",
    "these features are also confirmed for different proton number densities of 0.2 and 0.3 @xmath127 . in our simulations , @xmath261 is set 13 or 14 , which are considered to be large enough to calculate the total coulomb energy per particle in accuracy less than @xmath307 kev , which is the typical value of the energy difference between successive `` pasta '' phases in neutron star matter obtained by previous works .",
