    "recently , nonequilibrium phase transitions have been intensively studied in variety of models  @xcite .",
    "in addition to some potential applications , the motivation to study these transitions comes from the belief that they can be categorized into universality classes similarly to equilibrium phase transitions . in this context , models which exhibit transitions between active and absorbing phases  @xcite are of particular interest . there already exists substantial numerical evidence that phase transitions in such models indeed can be classified into some universality classes .",
    "for example , it is believed that models with unique absorbing states should belong to the so - called directed - percolation ( dp ) universality class  @xcite .",
    "moreover , models with double ( symmetric ) absorbing states or with some conservation law in their dynamics , belong to another universality class  @xcite .    similarly to equilibrium systems ,",
    "nonequilibrium continuous phase transitions are not the only possibility - some models are known to undergo discontinuous transitions  @xcite .",
    "although such transitions are not classified into universality classes , they might be more relevant since , discontinuous transitions are , at present , the only type of transitions which can be observed experimentally . on the contrary , the experimental realization of continuous phase transitions still remains an open problem  @xcite .",
    "one reason for a relatively good understanding of equilibrium phase transitions is a wealth of exactly solvable models in this field  @xcite . with this respect ,",
    "the situation is much worse for nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "none of the models with absorbing states and with continuous or discontinuous transitions was solved exactly and all results concerning the critical exponents or the location of a transition point are only numerical .    in the present paper",
    "we study certain models with infinitely many absorbing states . at a certain value of a control parameter @xmath0 ,",
    "these models undergo a transition between active and absorbing phases .",
    "but the interesting point is a novel type of this transition : it seems to combine some features of both discontinuous and continuous transitions .",
    "namely , at @xmath0 an order parameter jumps discontinuously to zero but in addition to that the order parameter has a power - law singularity upon approaching the transition point from the active phase .",
    "moreover , some elementary arguments , supported by monte carlo simulations , prompted us to predict the exact location of the transition point in both models , namely , @xmath1 .",
    "both models have a gauge - like symmetry , which might be responsible for the unusual behaviour of these models .",
    "our first model is a certain modification of a model introduced in a context of modelling biological evolution  @xcite .",
    "it is defined on a two - dimensional ( @xmath2 ) square lattice where for each bond between the nearest - neighbouring sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 we introduce bond variables @xmath5 . introducing the parameter @xmath6 ,",
    "we call the site @xmath3 active when @xmath7 , where @xmath4 runs over all nearest neighbours of @xmath3 .",
    "otherwise , the site is called nonactive .",
    "the model is driven by random sequential dynamics and when the active site @xmath3 is selected , we assign anew , with uniform probability , four bond variables @xmath8 , where @xmath4 is one of the nearest neighbours of @xmath3 .",
    "nonactive sites are not updated , but updating a certain ( active ) site might change the status of its neighbours .",
    "an important quantity characterizing this model is the steady - state density of active sites @xmath9 .",
    "how does @xmath9 change with the control parameter @xmath6 ?",
    "of course , for @xmath10 all sites are active ( @xmath11 ) for any distribution of bond variables @xmath8 .",
    "it is natural to expect that for @xmath12 and not too small there will be a certain fraction of active sites ( @xmath13 ) and this fraction will decrease when @xmath6 decreases .",
    "since the dynamical rules imply that the model has absorbing states with all sites nonactive ( @xmath14 ) , one can expect that at a certain @xmath6 the model undergoes a transition between the active and absorbing phases . on general grounds",
    "one expects that this transition might be either continuous and presumably of ( 2 + 1)dp universality class  @xcite or discontinuous .",
    "the existence of a transition is confirmed in fig.[f1 ] , which shows the density @xmath9 as a function of @xmath6 obtained using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the simulations were performed for the linear system size @xmath15 and we checked that the presented results are , within small statistical error , size - independent . after relaxing the random initial configuration for @xmath16 , we made measurements during runs of @xmath17 ( the unit of time is defined as a single on average update / lattice site ) . from this figure one can also see that the transition point @xmath18 is located very close to @xmath19 and in the following we are going to show that it is very likely that in this model @xmath1 ( exactly ) .",
    "first , we show that for @xmath20 the model is in the absorbing phase .",
    "the argument for that is elementary and based on the following observation : for @xmath20 there exists a finite probability that after updating a given site will become nonactive forever .",
    "indeed , when one of the anew selected bonds satisfies the condition @xmath21 then the sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 become permanently nonactive ( i.e. , no matter what are the other bonds attached to these sites , they will always remain nonactive ) .",
    "for @xmath20 there is a finite probability to satisfy eq .",
    "[ e1 ] and the above mechanism leads to the rapid decrease of active sites and hence the system reaches an absorbing state .",
    "the above mechanism is not effective for @xmath22 since there is no value which would ensure permanent nonactivity of a certain site .    to confirm that for @xmath20 the system is in the absorbing phase , we present in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] the time evolution of @xmath9 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "although these values are very close to @xmath19 , one can clearly see that the system evolves toward the absorbing state .",
    "( for @xmath6 smaller than these values , the approach to the absorbing state would be even faster . ) as we have already mentioned , for @xmath22 the mechanism which generates permanently nonactive sites is not effective .",
    "most likely , this has important consequences : as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , even for @xmath19 the system does not evolve toward the absorbing state but remains in the active phase .",
    "these results indicate that at @xmath19 the model undergoes a first - order transition between active and absorbing phases , characterized by a discontinuity of the order parameter @xmath9 . however , the most interesting feature of the model is the fact that upon approaching the first - order transition point @xmath19 the order parameter exhibits a power - law singularity .",
    "such singularities usually signals a continuous transition .",
    "this singularity , which is already visible in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , is also presented in the logarithmic plot in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . the parameter @xmath25 ( i.e. , the density of active sites for @xmath19 ) in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] was obtained from the least - square analysis of small-@xmath6 ( @xmath26 ) data shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] using the formula @xmath27 where we assumed that the critical point is located at @xmath19  @xcite . from the slope of the data in fig  [ f3 ] , we estimate @xmath28 , which might suggest that the exponent @xmath29 for that model is the same as in the ( 2 + 1)dp  @xcite . however , a characteristic feature of models of the dp universality class is that at the transition point the model falls into an absorbing state .",
    "our model at the transition point ( @xmath19 ) is not in the absorbing phase ( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) , but it enters the absorbing phase as soon as @xmath6 becomes negative .",
    "in addition , scaling behaviour of our numerical data persists on a relatively small interval of @xmath6 and asymptotically a different behaviour might sets in .",
    "further arguments against dp criticality of this model are presented in the next section .",
    "let us notice that the above model is characterized by very large gauge - like symmetry .",
    "indeed , inverting ( @xmath30 ) four bond variables around any elementary square does not change the activity of sites .",
    "the gauge symmetry was examined for many equilibrium lattice models  @xcite .",
    "however , the up - to - now examined models with absorbing states do not possess this kind of symmetry .",
    "it would be interesting to check whether the unusual properties of this model are related with this symmetry . in the following we examine a one - dimensional model which possesses a similar symmetry .",
    "let us examine a model defined on a one - dimensional ( @xmath31 ) ladder - like lattice , where each site also has four neighbours ( see fig .  [ zigzag ] ) .",
    "when defined with the same dynamical rules as the model examined in the previous section , this @xmath31 model also has an analogous gauge symmetry ( see fig .",
    "[ zigzag ] ) .",
    "we examined the properties of this model using the same monte carlo method .",
    "results of our simulations for the steady - state density @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] and fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . as is usually the case of models with absorbing states , monte carlo simulations of the @xmath31 version are much more accurate .",
    "for example , close to and at the transition point @xmath19 we simulated the system of the size @xmath32 and the simulation time was typically @xmath33 . as a result",
    "we were able to probe a much closer vicinity of the transition point .",
    "our results indicate that the behaviour of @xmath31 and @xmath2 versions of this model is very similar .",
    "both models exhibit a qualitatively the same transition at @xmath19 . in the @xmath31 case our estimations of the critical parameters are : @xmath34 and @xmath35 . a relatively good scaling behaviour in this case",
    "is confirmed on over two decades ( see fig .",
    "the obtained value of the exponent @xmath29 clearly excludes the dp value ( in the case of one - dimensional dp @xmath36  @xcite .    to get further insight into the nature of the transition point we examined the size dependence of the relaxation time @xmath37 .",
    "we measured the time needed for the system starting from the random initial configuration to reach the steady - state .",
    "typically , at the continuous transition @xmath37 diverges as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a positive exponent . for the one- and two - dimensional dp @xmath40 and 1.76 , respectively . at the discontinuous transition one",
    "expects that @xmath37 remains finite in the thermodynamic limit ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) . for @xmath19 and @xmath31 results of our measurements , shown in fig .",
    "[ tau ] are , in our opinion , inconclusive .",
    "they may suggest a power - law divergence with a small exponent @xmath42 ) , but positive curvature of our data might asymptotically lead to @xmath41 . on the other hand even if @xmath41 , it is not certain whether @xmath37 remains finite or diverges , but slower than a power of @xmath43 . for @xmath44 ( i.e. , off - criticality )",
    "the numerical data are similar to the @xmath19 , but on general grounds one expects that @xmath37 remains finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in the present paper we studied two models which exhibit remarkably similar and unusual behaviour .",
    "these models have a transition point which , although mainly of discontinuous nature ( jump of the order parameter and @xmath41 ) has a certain feature of continuous transitions ( power - law singularity of the order parameter ) .    the main weakness of our paper is the lack of any theoretical argument which would explain the behaviour of these models .",
    "both models possess certain gauge - like symmetry .",
    "the role of such symmetry in models with absorbing states was not yet explored and it is possible that the behaviour of these models might be related with this symmetry .",
    "are there any indications that such transitions might take place in real systems ? in our opinion , one of the possible applications might be related with phase transitions in nuclear physics . indeed , there are some indications that multifragmentation of heavy nuclei resembles a phase transition which has both first- and second - order features  @xcite .",
    "such systems have been already modeled using ising - like models .",
    "however , such an approach implicitly assumes a thermalization of the system , which is not obvious in these multifragmentation processes .",
    "models with absorbing states might provide an alternative description of such processes .",
