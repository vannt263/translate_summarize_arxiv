    "zamiatin , a.m.  zanetti , j.  zhao ,    measurements of deep inelastic scattering of polarized muons from polarized protons and deuterons determine the spin dependent structure functions of the nucleon which allow fundamental tests of quantum chromodynamics and of models of nucleon structure @xcite .",
    "the precision of these experiments is strongly related to the polarization of the target nucleons .",
    "therefore , the large enhancement of our deuteron target polarization which we discovered during the data - taking for deep inelastic muon scattering @xcite had a significant impact on our experiment at cern .",
    "the discovery was associated with a faulty regulator of the high voltage power supply of a microwave source .",
    "after controllable frequency modulation ( fm ) of the microwave tube was implemented , a gain by a factor of 1.7 in the maximum deuteron vector polarization and of 2.0 in the polarization growth rate were achieved .",
    "these increases have been of crucial importance because data - taking extends over many months and the statistical error is proportional to @xmath8 , in which @xmath9 is the target vector polarization and n is the number of scattered events .",
    "the magnitude of the enhancement has been reported earlier @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to detail the full characteristics of this effect , to present new data on the electron paramagnetic resonance absorption ( epr ) spectrum and to discuss briefly processes which may contribute to the fm phenomenon .    the polarized target @xcite consists of two cells each @xmath10 cm long and @xmath11 cm in diameter located in a large cylindrical multimode microwave cavity .",
    "the two target halves are polarized in opposite directions by dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) .",
    "the target material is glassy , perdeuterated 1-butanol , @xmath12 with @xmath13 by weight of deuterium oxide , doped with the paramagnetic edba - cr(v ) complex @xcite to a concentration of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it is located in a magnetic field of @xmath15 t with a uniformity of @xmath16 over the volume and is cooled by a dilution refrigerator .",
    "the dnp is obtained by applying microwave power near the epr frequency of the paramagnetic complex .",
    "the deuteron vector polarization is measured with nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) probes , each of which is part of a series tuned q - meter circuit @xcite .",
    "the material is sampled by five probes in each target cell .",
    "the polarization is determined from the integrated nmr signals , calibrated in thermal equilibrium at 1k .",
    "the relative accuracy of the measurement @xmath17 is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the microwave power for dnp is produced by two extended interaction oscillators ( eio ) with an emission bandwidth of about @xmath18  mhz .",
    "the rate of polarization is optimized by controlling the microwave power and frequency .",
    "the frequency is controlled by the eio cathode voltage with a sensitivity of about @xmath19  mhz / v or by tuning the eio cavity .",
    "the power is controlled by non - reflective attenuators .    for materials in which the solid effect @xcite dominates as a mechanism for dnp , it has been found that microwave fm can improve the rate of dnp .",
    "this appears to result from the fact that fm counteracts the effect of `` hole burning '' due to epr absorption at a fixed frequency @xcite . in the glassy alcohol materials with cr(v ) complexes ,",
    "where the dynamic nuclear cooling @xcite is the dominant mechanism for dnp , hole burning is not expected .",
    "however a polarization enhancement of @xmath20 to @xmath21 was observed in a fluorinated alcohol leading to polarizations of @xmath22 for protons and @xmath23f @xcite .",
    "references to enhancements of a few percent at polarizations around @xmath24 or of about @xmath25 for a material with only a few percent polarization can also be found in @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "no studies have been reported for the effect of fm on deuteron polarization except in one case where fm was used to compensate for magnetic field inhomogeneity and improve the final polarization by @xmath13 to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the large enhancement of deuteron polarization in our target due to fm came therefore as a surprise .",
    "figure  1 shows the typical time evolution of the deuteron polarization @xmath27 without and with fm . for this figure",
    "the cathode voltages were modulated at @xmath28khz with a @xmath29volt peak - to - peak amplitude leading to a fm amplitude @xmath30mhz for the @xmath31ghz microwave source .",
    "the maximum deuteron vector polarizations under these conditions were @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    the epr spectrum was measured in our target at a constant frequency by scanning the magnetic field .",
    "such a spectrum , shown in figure  2 without fm , was obtained using a @xmath34 speer composite carbon resistor as a bolometer , located in the dilute phase of the mixing chamber outside the target material @xcite .",
    "the input power to the microwave cavity @xmath35 is the sum of @xmath36 , the power absorbed by the material in the epr process , and @xmath37 the non - resonant power absorbed into the cavity .",
    "the power absorbed by the bolometer @xmath38 is a constant fraction @xmath39 of @xmath37 .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the temperature of the bolometer , @xmath42 is the temperature of the dilute phase and @xmath43 is a constant @xcite . during the epr measurement",
    "the input power @xmath35 remains constant and we can neglect the variations of @xmath44 .",
    "consequently the relation @xmath45 shows that @xmath36 is a linear function of @xmath46 .",
    "the broad absorption band seen in figure  2 is due to the anisotropy of the @xmath47factor of the edba - cr(v ) electron spin .",
    "the highest positive and negative polarizations without fm were obtained at frequencies @xmath48ghz and @xmath49ghz , respectively .",
    "the epr spectra with better resolution at the edges of the absorption band are shown in figure  3a and 3b , both with and without fm .",
    "the data points with fm were obtained using a modulation amplitude @xmath50mhz to keep a good resolution in our spectra . in order to measure the small change in epr aborption due to",
    "fm a novel technique of making consecutive measurements of the bolometer resistance with and without fm at each field step was employed . in figures  3c and",
    "3d we display the difference @xmath51 .",
    "these data demonstrate that fm increases @xmath36 in the edges of the epr spectrum .",
    "note that the structures in figure  3a and 3b which extend down to @xmath52ghz and up to @xmath53ghz are almost entirely eliminated in the presence of fm even though the amplitude of fm is small compared to their width .    in figure  4",
    "we show the difference @xmath54 as a function of the frequency of fm for different input power levels @xmath35 with an fm amplitude @xmath55mhz at @xmath56ghz where @xmath54 reaches a maximum .",
    "this difference grows with the modulation frequency up to a maximum value ( indicated by the arrows ) and then remains constant .",
    "the frequencies at which the additional epr absorption reaches its maximum value increase roughly linearly with @xmath35 .",
    "a study of the polarization growth rate was performed at high negative @xmath27 values for a setting of @xmath35 close to the one which was used for curve 2 of fig.4 .",
    "the rate increased with modulation frequency and reached a maximum value of @xmath57 per hour when modulating at @xmath58hz . at this @xmath35 value",
    ", @xmath54 reaches a maximum at this frequency which suggests strongly that the additional epr absorption due to fm is what leads to the enhanced dnp .    in further measurements",
    ", we have established that the highest positive and negative polarizations with fm were obtained using @xmath59mhz at @xmath60ghz and @xmath61ghz , respectively .",
    "the gain in maximum polarization due to fm is 1.7 and the increase in polarizing speed is about two . the homogeneity of the deuteron polarization throughout the target volume was investigated .",
    "two radially superimposed coils measuring polarization at radii of @xmath62 cm and @xmath63 cm showed a deuteron polarization ratio from the small to the large coil of 1.20 before and 1.06 after applying fm @xcite .",
    "a study of the deuteron nmr line asymmetry @xcite provided us with an upper limit @xmath64 for the spatial variation of @xmath27 .",
    "typical values for @xmath64 were @xmath65 without fm and @xmath66 with fm which confirmed that fm improves the uniformity of polarization .    the large enhancement has been confirmed recently in our new @xmath67 target @xcite where maximum deuteron polarizations of 0.46 and -0.60 were observed using fm . in spite of the improved magnetic field uniformity of @xmath68 of the new target , the optimum @xmath69 for fm was about @xmath70 as in the previous target with @xmath16 field uniformity .",
    "also we find that @xmath69 is large compared to the target magnetic field inhomogeneity in both targets .",
    "we conclude that the mechanism by which fm improves polarization has little to do with the field nonuniformity . for protons",
    "fm increased the polarization , typically from 0.75 to 0.85 , and to maximum values as high as 0.95 @xcite .",
    "the existing theory @xcite provides a qualitative understanding of the dnp for our target material ; however , the large polarization enhancement due to microwave fm may require additional mechanisms .",
    "an example is the cross - relaxation within the system of electron spins which has been assumed to be fast .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that a slow cross - relaxation may lead to a lack of thermal equilibrium among electron spins and hence to unequal spin temperatures for different nuclei which results in lower nuclear polarization .",
    "fm may counteract this effect by increasing the number of electron spins which are saturated .",
    "a possibly related effect is the local depletion of the electron spin packets which has been observed for materials whose epr lines are broadened by hyperfine interactions when irradiated at fixed frequency .",
    "with fm , this local depletion can be avoided and a migration of spin packets occurs towards the wings of the epr band @xcite .",
    "this may result in a stronger epr absorption in the wings .",
    "since the aim of our experiment was to measure spin - dependent asymmetries in polarized deep inelastic scattering , we did not attempt a more detailed study of the effect of fm on the target polarization .",
    "our observations of the epr absorption were used as a guide to optimize the parameters of the fm .    in conclusion , we discovered a large increase in deuteron polarization due to frequency modulation which is of great value for our high energy physics experiment .",
    "we found that an amplitude of fm of @xmath71mhz and a frequency of @xmath28khz improved the deuteron polarization growth rate by a factor of 2 and resulted in deuteron polarizations as high as @xmath72 with improved spatial uniformity over the target volume .",
    "relations of this large fm effect to features of the epr absorption mechanism were found and may provide useful information to a deeper understanding of dynamic nuclear polarization .",
