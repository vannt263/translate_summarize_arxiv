    "the presented work takes place in a more general framework : the modelling of unsteady mixed flows in any kind of closed pipe taking into account the cavitation problem and air entrapment .",
    "we are interested in flows occurring in closed pipes with non uniform sections , where some parts of the flow can be free surface ( it means that only a part of the pipe is filled ) and other parts are pressurized ( it means that the pipe is full ) .",
    "the transition phenomenon between the two types of flows occurs in many situations such as storm sewers , waste or supply pipes in hydroelectric installations .",
    "it can be induced by sudden changes in the boundary conditions as failure pumping . during this process",
    ", the pressure can reach severe values and may cause damages .",
    "the simulation of such a phenomenon is thus a major challenge and a great amount of works was devoted to it these last years ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , for instance ) .",
    "the classical shallow water equations are commonly used to describe free surface flows in open channels .",
    "they are also used in the study of mixed flows using the preissman slot artefact ( see for example @xcite ) . however",
    ", this technic does not take into account the depressurisation phenomenon which occurs during a water hammer except in recent works @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the allievi equations , commonly used to describe pressurized flows , are written in a non - conservative form which is not well adapted to a natural coupling with the shallow water equations .    a model for the unsteady mixed water flows in closed pipes and a finite volume discretisation have been previously studied by two of the authors @xcite and a kinetic formulation has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we propose here the * pfs*-model which tends to extend naturally the work in @xcite in the case of a closed pipe with non uniform section .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we do not deal with the deformation of the domain induced by the change of pressure .",
    "we will consider only an infinitely rigid pipe .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the derivation of the free surface model from the @xmath0d _ incompressible _ euler equations which are written in a suitable local reference frame ( following @xcite ) in order to take into account the local effects produced by the changes of section and the slope variation .",
    "the construction of the free surface model is done by a formal asymptotic analysis .",
    "seeking for an approximation at first order gives the model called * fs*-model . in section  [ sectionpfmodel ] , we adapt the derivation of the * fs*-model to derive the pressurized model , called * p*-model , from the @xmath0d _ compressible _ euler equations .",
    "writing the source terms of these two models , * p * and * fs*-model , into a unified form and using the same couple of conservative unknowns as in @xcite , we propose in section [ sectioncoupling ] a model for mixed flows , that we call * pfs*-model .",
    "we state some mathematical properties of this model .",
    "section [ pfsroe ] is devoted to the extension of the vfroe scheme described in @xcite that was used for the case of uniform pipes . in section [ sectionwb ]",
    ", we show how to construct a convection matrix in order to get an exactly well - balanced scheme .",
    "several numerical tests are presented in section [ numericaltests ] .",
    "the classical shallow water equations are used to describe physical situations like rivers , coastal domains , oceans and sedimentation problems .",
    "these equations are obtained from the incompressible euler system ( see e.g. @xcite ) or from the incompressible navier - stokes system ( see for instance @xcite ) by several techniques ( e.g. by direct integration or asymptotic analysis ) .",

    "we start from the @xmath0d incompressible euler equations where we neglect the acceleration following the @xmath1-axis supposing the existence of a privileged main flow axis .",
    "we write then the euler equations in the local serret - frenet reference frame in order to take into account the local effects produced by the changes of section and the slope variation .",

    "the upwinding of the source terms may introduce stationary waves with a vanishing denominator when critical flows occurs i.e. @xmath504 .",

    "nevertheless , at the present time , we are interested in a mathematical kinetic formulation of the * pfs * model and the construction of a numerical kinetic scheme that avoids all these drawbacks @xcite .",
    "the next step is to take into account the air entrainment which may have non negligible effects on the behaviour of the piezometric head .",

    "<S> transition point between the two types of flows is treated as a free boundary associated to a discontinuity of the gradient of pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical simulation is performed by making use of a roe - like finite volume scheme that we adapted to take into account geometrical source terms in the convection matrix . finally some numerical tests are presented .    </S>",
