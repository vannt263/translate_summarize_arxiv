    "the last section is the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we consider the ground state in some limits .",
    "in the @xmath30 case , the system consists of two independent @xmath4 @xmath0 chains , and it was solved exactly @xcite . in the @xmath31 region , there is the ferromagnetic phase . in the @xmath32 region ,",
    "the xy ( spin fluid ) phase appears . in the @xmath33 region",
    ", the nel phase appears .    in the @xmath34 case",
    ", this model can be mapped onto an @xmath35 @xmath0 spin chain .",
    "the @xmath35 @xmath0 spin chain has been studied by many authors @xcite . in this system , there are four phases , i.e. , the ferromagnetic phase , the @xmath1 phase , the haldane phase , and the nel phase .",

    "this phase has the following correlation function : @xmath38 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : stripe](a ) ) .",
    "if @xmath11 is negative , the ground state is the fully ferromagnetic phase .    in the @xmath39 case",
    ", we can expect that antiferromagnetic ( nel ) ordered phases appear in each leg direction . if @xmath11 is positive",
    ", the ground state is the nel phase in the rung direction .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stripe](c ) ) .",
    "if @xmath11 is negative , the ground state is the ferromagnetic correlation in the rung direction .",
    "this phase is called as the stripe nel phase .",
    "the staggered magnetization appears in the leg direction .",
    "this phase has the following correlation function , @xmath40 ( see fig .",

    ", we can expect that the rung - singlet phase appears .",
    "this state is a nondegenerate , massive phase .",
    "we can understand this state as the direct product of singlets in the rung direction .",
    "in this section , we roughly estimate phase boundaries using the variational method in some limits under the periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) .      at first",
    ", we consider the phase transition between the rung singlet phase and the stripe ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the variational energy of the pure rung - singlet state is given as follows : @xmath43 where @xmath12 is the system size ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the number of sites ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the variational energy of the pure stripe - ferromagnetic state is given as follows : @xmath44 so we can roughly estimate that the phase boundary between the rung singlet phase and the stripe ferromagnetic phase is @xmath45 in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 limit .",
    "this phase transition is related to an spontaneously @xmath48 symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore , this is the second order phase transition and its universality class may be the two dimensional ( 2d ) ising type .",
    "next , we consider the phase transition between the nel phase and the rung singlet phase .",
    "the variational energy of the pure nel state is given as follows : @xmath49 so we can roughly estimate the phase boundary between the rung singlet phase and the nel phase is @xmath50 , in @xmath51 and @xmath47 limit .",
    "this phase transition is related to the @xmath48 symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore , this phase transition is the second order phase transition and its universality class may be the 2d - ising type .",
    "in this section , we treat the bipartite systems .",
    "that is , the system size ( @xmath13 ) is even under the periodic boundary condition , or the system size ( @xmath12 ) is arbitrary under the open boundary condition , where @xmath14 is the number of spins .",
    "in the ferromagnetic coupling case ( @xmath52 ) , we found that the ferromagnetic phase appears .",
    "et al . _ have obtained that the phase boundary between @xmath1 phase and the ferromagnetic phase locates at @xmath53 using the instability analysis of the spin wave theory for the ferromagnetic phase @xcite . here",
    "we try to use another approach for this phase transition .",
    "we transform the original hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) using a following unitary operator : @xmath54 \\label{eq : unitary1}\\ ] ] ( see fig [ fig : nrung ] ) .",
    "this unitary operator transform @xmath55 .",
    "especially , in the @xmath53 case , the transformed hamiltonian is described as the pure heisenberg model with a negative coupling constant .",
    "now we can choose a set of basis vectors as eigenvectors which diagonalize @xmath56 .",
    "then all off - diagonal elements of the transformed hamiltonian have a negative sign . from perron - frobenius s theorem ,",
    "the ground state is unique in the fixed @xmath57 space in the finite system , and we can choose that all the coefficients are positive .",
    "since the transformed system has an @xmath58 symmetry in the @xmath53 case , states with @xmath59 are degenerate ( su(2 ) ferro ) .",
    "this means that @xmath60 line is the phase boundary , between the fully ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath31 ) and the @xmath1 phase ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "especially , in the @xmath62 case and the system size @xmath63 , where @xmath12 is even , there are the number of @xmath64 degenerated ground states , since this system has an @xmath65 symmetry .",
    "we can consider that this point is the multicritical point , where the bkt transition line meets the 2d ising type phase transition line .      in this case , we consider the unitary transformation ( [ eq : unitary1 ] ) , ( see fig [ fig : nrung ] ) .",
    "after this unitary transformation , all off - diagonal elements of hamiltonian become negative . from the discussion of the previous subsection , signs of correlation functions",
    "are represented in the original hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) as follows , @xmath66 this corresponds to the ferromagnetic phase , the @xmath26 phase , haldane phase and the stripe nel phase .      in this case , we consider the following unitary transformation : @xmath67 \\label{eq : unitary2}\\ ] ] ( see fig [ fig : prung ] ) .",
    "this unitary operator transform @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "after this unitary transformation , all off - diagonal elements of hamiltonian become negative . from the marshall - lieb - mattis s theorem@xcite , this case has following signs of the correlation function in the original hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) : @xmath70 this corresponds to the stripe ferromagnetic phase , the @xmath28 phase , the rung singlet phase and nel phase .      in this subsection , we consider ( @xmath72 case .",
    "using the unitary transformation ( [ eq : unitary1 ] ) , we can see that the system has an @xmath58 symmetry . from mermin - wagner s",
    "theorem , since there is no long range order with the spontaneously continuous symmetry breaking , the ground state is not the stripe ferromagnetic phase .",
    "since there is no soft mode with the wave number @xmath73 for the transformed hamiltonian , there is no possibility that it is described as a @xmath74 @xmath58 wess - zumino - witten model , which is massless .    from the marshall - lieb - mattis s theorem @xcite ,",
    "the sign of the correlation function transformed by unitary operator ( [ eq : unitary1 ] ) , @xmath75 thus this ground state is not an @xmath58 ferromagnetic phase .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the ground state is the rung singlet phase in the ( @xmath71 ) case .",
    "in this section , we discuss the phase diagram from the exact solutions .",
    "this system with @xmath30 consists of two independent chains . from the exact solution we know that @xmath4 @xmath0 chain with anisotropy @xmath76 is massive , and the ground state is twofold degenerate .",
    "now the system is two decoupled chains , therefore , the ground state is fourfold degenerate . in following subsections",
    ", we discuss the neighborhood of @xmath30 .",
    "in @xmath31 region , we can find two different two ferromagnetic ordered phases , as suggested by vekua _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the usual ferromagnetic ordered phase is two fold degenerate .",
    "however on the @xmath77 line , the ground state is four fold degenerate . in the first case",
    "all spins of both chains are up ; in the second case all spins of both chains are down ; in the third case all spins of 1-chain is up and all spins of 2-chain is down ; and in the forth case all spins of 1-chain is down and all spins of 2-chain is down ( see fig.([fig : stripe])(a ) ) .",
    "these four states have the same energy exactly on the @xmath30 . a nonzero @xmath11 term breaks this degeneracy .",
    "this means that @xmath77 line is the phase boundary .",
    "in addition , the system , which consists of two independent gapped system is gapped .",
    "so this phase transition is the first order transition .",
    "the discussion in the previous subsection can be applied to the antiferromagnetic ordered phase similarly .",
    "firstly , we consider the single @xmath4 @xmath0 chain . from the exact solution , in @xmath78 region ,",
    "the ground state is the antiferromagnetic ( nel ) ordered state , which is two fold degenerate .",
    "secondly , we consider independent double @xmath4 @xmath0 chains .",
    "the ground state is fourfold degenerate in @xmath78 region , since this total system is described as the direct product of the single chain system .",
    "these ground states are shown in fig.[fig : stripe ] ( b),(c ) .",
    "lastly , we consider the coupled @xmath4 @xmath0 chains described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the rung - coupling term breaks the four fold degeneracy in the above case . in @xmath27 case , the ferromagnetic ordered state in the rung direction ( see , fig.[fig : stripe ] ( b ) ) , which is called as the stripe nel phase . in @xmath23 case , the antiferromagnetic ordered state in the rung direction ( see , fig.[fig : stripe ] ( c ) ) , which is called as the nel phase .",
    "both states are antiferromagnetic ordered in the leg direction .",
    "since the system is gapped in the @xmath30 case , this phase transition between the nel phase and the stripe nel phase is the first order transition .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider the weak coupling s=1/2 xxz chain , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    at",
    "first , we consider two independent chains , @xmath30 case .",
    "this case is exactly solved using bethe ansatz@xcite .",
    "one chain in the @xmath81 region is described by tl liquid @xcite .",
    "two independent chains are described by the direct product of two tl liquids .",
    "this model has critical properties in extended regions in the parameter space .",
    "here we consider the case that there are some perturbations for this system .",
    "these systems can be analyzed using the bosonization method @xcite .",
    "then two decoupled chains are described in two bosonic fields , @xmath82 and @xmath83 of each other .",
    "we obey the notation used in ref.@xcite and introduce the symmetric and antisymmetric combination of the bosonic field , @xmath84 we consider the case with @xmath85 .",
    "behavior of the symmetric field is governed by the effective sine - goldon model .",
    "@xmath86 is always relevant .",
    "@xmath87 is relevant for @xmath88 , irrelevant for @xmath89 , where @xmath90 are constant @xcite .",
    "the phase transition between the @xmath1 phase and the nondegenerate massive phase is the @xmath91 bkt type transition when the system has a simple @xmath92 symmetry , where @xmath93 is the tl parameter . in this case , a @xmath94 mode is always massive , and a @xmath95 mode becomes massless .",
    "we can distinguish two different @xmath1 phases .",
    "one @xmath1 phase ( @xmath26 ) is in @xmath27 , another @xmath1 phase ( @xmath28 ) is in @xmath23 region . in the @xmath23 region , from the marshall - lieb - mattis s theorem , @xmath96 . on the other hand , in the @xmath27 region , @xmath97 .",
    "therefore these two @xmath1 phases have different symmetry .",
    "a @xmath30 line is the second order phase transition line .",
    "the system on the @xmath30 line is described as two component tl liquid .",
    "this second order phase transition is explained as that one component of the tl liquid remains massless , but another component become massive .",
    "here we summarize this subsection in the cft language . in the @xmath98 region ,",
    "the system is described by the central charge @xmath99 cft on the @xmath30 line .",
    "and there exists a region which is described as @xmath25 cft in the @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "in this section , we determine the critical points and the universality class .",
    "we show the numerical results of @xmath102 systems using the exact diagonalization , and the level spectroscopy method with the twisted boundary condition @xcite .",
    "we can expect that this phase transition is the bkt type . using the level spectroscopy method , we determine critical points of this phase transition . considering symmetries , we can identify critical points as cross points of two low - lying excitations .",
    "one has quantum numbers @xmath103 under the periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) , another has quantum numbers @xmath104 under the twisted boundary condition ( tbc ) @xmath105 . here",
    "@xmath106 is total magnetizations of the system ( @xmath107 ) , and @xmath108 is the parity defined under the following transformation @xmath109 , @xmath110 is the parity under the tbc .",
    "@xmath111 is the wave number defined under the periodic boundary condition , @xmath12 is the system size which is a half of the number of sites .",
    "we show crossing points in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp - xy - rs ]",
    ".    however values of crossing points have size dependence .",
    "we can remove logarithmic corrections , which is proportional to @xmath112 , using the level spectroscopy method .",
    "however , there remain other corrections which come from the lattice structure .",
    "for example , there are correction terms from the @xmath113 irrelevant field ( @xmath114 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore we extrapolate crossing points as follows , @xmath115 or @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a fitting parameter .",
    "we neglect higher order terms @xmath118 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sizeeff ] , we show the size dependence of the crossing points and its extrapolation",
    ". then we can find the phase boundary under the infinite system limit in fig.([fig : pd - xy - rs ] ) .    in order to confirm the consistency of our results ,",
    "we need check the universality class using cft @xcite . in this case , the critical theory which describes the transition line is the @xmath25 cft .",
    "the central charge appears as an universal finite size correction for the ground state energy under the pbc @xcite , @xmath119 where @xmath12 is the system size , @xmath120 is the ground state energy per site in the infinite system , @xmath121 is the spin wave velocity .",
    "now @xmath122 correction terms are small enough for numerical data , so we neglect it . in order to numerically determine the central charge , we should obtain @xmath121 in addition to the ground state energy .",
