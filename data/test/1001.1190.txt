    "there is a growing interest nowadays to design systems whose hamiltonians have given spectral characteristics . in this context , the idea of designing potentials with prescribed energy spectra is worth investigating .",
    "some progress in this area has been done by restricting the construction of potentials isospectral to a given initial one except a few energy values through the usage of darboux transformation @xcite , factorization method @xcite , supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susyqm ) @xcite and other related techniques .",
    "the underlying idea of most of these procedures has been summarized in an algebraic scheme known as intertwining approach . in general , the objective of the intertwining is to construct the so - called intertwining operator @xmath3 which performs an intertwining between an initial solvable hamiltonian @xmath4 and a new solvable one @xmath5 with slightly modified spectrum such that @xmath6 the ingredients to implement the intertwining are seed solutions of the initial stationary schrdinger equation associated to factorization energies less than or equal to the ground state energy of @xmath4 . if @xmath3 is a first order differential operator , the standard susyqm , with supercharges built of first order darboux transformation operators , and the factorization method are recovered . on the other hand , if higher order differential operators are involved in the construction of @xmath7 , it gives rise to higher order susyqm @xcite .",
    "it is possible to generate families of isospectral hamiltonians by either of the two ways : + ( i ) by iteration of first order darboux transformations .",
    "every chain of @xmath0 first order darboux transformation creates a chain of exactly solvable hamiltonians @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "hence the intertwining operator @xmath9 between the initial hamiltonian @xmath10 and the final hamiltonian @xmath11 can always be presented as a product of @xmath0 first order darboux transformation operators between every two juxtaposed hamiltonians @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( ii ) by looking for the @xmath0-th order intertwining operator directly , expressing the intertwiner as a sum of @xmath14 terms @xmath15 , and solving the system of equations resulting from the intertwining relationship for the @xmath16 s .",
    "at this point it is appropriate to mention that the quantum mechanical systems with position dependent ( effective ) mass @xcite have attracted a lot of interest due to their relevance in describing the physics of many microstructures of current interest such as semiconductor heterostructures @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , helium clusters and metal crystals @xcite etc .",
    "recently , the intertwining operator method has been applied to schrdinger equation with position dependent ( effective ) mass to construct first - order and chains(iterations ) of first - order darboux transformations and the connection between the first - order darboux transformation and effective mass supersymmetry ( factorization ) was shown @xcite .",
    "subsequently darboux transformations of arbitrary order for position dependent mass schrdinger equation was derived and factorization of the n - th order transformation into first order transformations and existence of a reality condition for the transformed potential was shown @xcite . in the standard supersymmetric ( susy )",
    "approach for effective mass hamiltonians @xcite , the ladder operators are taken as first order differential operators similar to constant mass case , but now they depend on both superpotential and mass function . as a result one obtains two partner potentials with the same effective mass sharing identical spectra upto the zero mode of the supercharge .",
    "second order supersymmetric approach ( 2-susy)was used in ref @xcite for describing dynamics of a quantum particle with a position dependent mass . a compact expression for 2-susy isospectral pairs",
    "was derived in terms of senond order superpotential and the mass function .",
    "a detailed analysis has been given about zero mode equations of second order supercharges and possible reduction of 2-susy scheme to first order susy .",
    "recently , a generalization of standard susy known as higher derivative susy or @xmath0-fold susy @xcite was given for position dependent mass hamiltonians .",
    "this method keeps the basic superalgebra intact but differs from the standard first order susy in that the supercharges are represented as @xmath17-th order @xmath18 differential operators .    in this article",
    "an attempt is made to generate isospectral potentials of position dependent mass schrdinger equation ( pdmse ) by applying first and second order intertwining technique .",
    "specifically , the second order intertwiner is constructed by taking it as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the mass function and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are to be determined . substituting this in the intertwining relationship ( [ e60 ] ) ,",
    "we have been able to solve the apparently intricate system of equations for @xmath21 and @xmath22 by assuming an ansatz . as mentioned earlier , the closed form formulas for @xmath0-th order intertwining operators and a pair of isospectral hamiltonians with position dependent mass",
    "was already reported by tanaka @xcite , for an arbitrary value of @xmath0 without recourse to any ansatz .",
    "the motivation for constructing second order intertwining operator directly comes from the observation that although an @xmath0-th order intertwining operator can be expressed formally as a product of @xmath0 first order intertwining operators , it does not necessarily mean that a system constructed by an @xmath0-th order intertwining operator is equivalent to one constructed by @xmath0 successive applications of each @xmath23st order operator .",
    "in fact , it was shown in ref @xcite , by comparing the two approaches in the constant mass scenario , that the former is more general than the latter .",
    "the advantage of the direct method used here over the iterative method is that one can generate second - order isospectral partner potentials directly from the initial potential i.e. one need not go through the first - order intertwining technique .",
    "we shall see that as in the case of constant mass scenario , it is possible to generate isospectral potentials with some spectral modification : ( i ) to add new bound state(s ) ( ii ) to remove bound state(s ) and ( iii ) to leave the spectrum unaffected . in this context a natural question is : what is the utility of finding the isospectral potentials in the position dependent mass background ? to answer this",
    "let us note that in different areas of possible applications of low dimensional structures as already mentioned , there is need to have energy spectrum which is predetermined .",
    "for example , in the quantum well profile optimization , isospectral potentials ( by deleting or creating bound states at a particular energy of the original potential ) are generated through supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "this is necessary because a particular effect ( such as intersubband optical transitions in a quantum well ) may be grossly enhanced by achieving the resonance conditions e.g. appropriate spacings between the most relevant states and also by tailoring the wave functions so that the ( combinations of ) matrix elements relevant for this particular effect are maximized @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important for studying higher order nonlinear processes .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ii and iii we have explained the first and second - order intertwining techniques respectively with possible spectral modifications , with the help of a suitable example given in the appendix .",
    "also , the connection of our approach to type a @xmath0-fold susy is shown in these sections .",
    "section iv is kept for discussions and comments .",
    "we consider the following two one - dimensional effective mass schrodinger hamiltonians ( bendaniel - duke form ) @xcite with the same spectrum but with different potential @xmath24+v(x)\\label{e15}\\ ] ] and @xmath25+\\bar{v}(x)\\label{e16}\\ ] ] we connect the hamiltonians ( [ e15 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] ) by means of the intertwining technique . to this end",
    ", we look for an operator @xmath7 that satisfies the relation ( [ e60 ] ) . without loss of generality",
    "let us consider the first order intertwining operator @xcite , as @xmath26 now using the intertwining relation ( [ e60 ] ) and equating the coefficients of like order of derivatives we obtain @xmath27 and @xmath28 where ` prime ' denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "+ now using ( [ e29 ] ) , equation ( [ e30 ] ) reduces to @xmath30 integrating equation ( [ e36 ] ) we get @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a constant of integration .",
    "now we substitute @xmath33 where k = k(x ) being an auxiliary function , in equation ( [ e31 ] ) we obtain the following riccati equation @xmath34 the equation ( [ e58 ] ) can be linearized by the substitution @xmath35 . substituting this value of @xmath36 in equations ( [ e57 ] ) and ( [ e58 ] ) we get @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "the equation ( [ e18 ] ) is similar to equation ( [ e15 ] ) with @xmath39 , @xmath32 is sometimes called factorization energy and @xmath40 is called seed solution . it should be noted here that @xmath40 need not be normalizable solution of ( [ e18 ] ) . however , for @xmath41 to be well defined ( without singularity ) , @xmath42 must not have any zeroes on the real line .",
    "for this , we shall restrict @xmath43 throughout this article , @xmath44 being the ground state energy eigenvalues of the equation ( [ e15 ] ) . once we can determine the solution @xmath42 of ( [ e18 ] )",
    "then we shall able to construct the intertwiner @xmath3 , the isospectral partner @xmath45 and its bound state eigenvalues @xmath46 with the help of following relations @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49\\psi\\label{e21}\\ ] ] the intertwiner @xmath7 can not be used to generate wave function of @xmath50 at the factorization energy @xmath32 , because @xmath51 .",

    "it is clear from the equation ( [ e69 ] ) that the wave function of @xmath5 at the factorization energy @xmath32 can be obtained by @xmath65 i.e. , @xmath66=\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\mathcal{u}}\\label{e72}\\ ] ] it is to be noted that if @xmath42 corresponds to the bound state of @xmath67 , the wave function @xmath68 defined in ( [ e72])is not normalized so that @xmath32 does not belong to the bound state spectrum of @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath42 corresponds to the ground state wavefunction of @xmath67 then then the potential @xmath45 has no new singularity , except the singularity due to @xmath61 , provided @xmath69 is not singular and @xmath70 however , if we consider @xmath42 to an arbitrary state other than ground state of @xmath67 then @xmath45 might contain extra singularities , which are not present in @xmath61 .",

    "+      to show that the results obtained in the previous section are consistent with the results of type a @xmath0-fold susy , we are going to mention the brief results of type a @xmath17-fold susy formalism ( for details see @xcite and references there ) .",
