    "it is straightforward to construct non - anticommutative versions of ordinary supersymmetric theories by taking the superspace action and replacing the ordinary product by the moyal @xmath12-product@xcite which implements the non - anticommutativity .",

    "@xcite we returned to a closer examination of the non - anticommutative wess - zumino model ( with a superpotential ) in four dimensions , and showed that to obtain correct results for the theory where the auxiliary fields have been eliminated , from the corresponding results for the uneliminated theory , it is necessary to include in the classical action separate couplings for all the terms which may be generated by the renormalisation process ; and in ref .  @xcite we extended this analysis to the gauged @xmath13 case .",
    "there are obstacles to obtaining a renormalisable @xmath0 theory with a trilinear superpotential in the case of adjoint matter ( in the case of matter in the fundamental representation , only a mass term is allowed anyway)@xcite",

    "the problem is that the superpotential contains terms with different combinations of @xmath14 and @xmath13 chiral fields which mix under @xmath0 supersymmetry , but for which the yukawa couplings renormalise differently .",
    "however , recently an elegant solution to this problem has been found@xcite in which the kinetic terms for the @xmath13 chiral fields are modified , in such a way that the @xmath14 and @xmath13 chiral fields ( and consequently their yukawa couplings ) renormalise in exactly the same way . in ref .",

    "it is clearly interesting to ask whether this feature persists at higher orders .",
    "a full two - loop calculation would be extremely complex , and the results we present here are only partial in two respects .",
    "firstly we only check the renormalisation of one , judiciously chosen , term in the action ( of course if different terms in the action required different renormalisations of @xmath16 , this would represent a violation of @xmath0 supersymmetry ) ; and secondly , we only check the terms in the two - loop renormalisation constant for @xmath16 which include the yukawa coupling , omitting the purely gauge - coupling dependent term .",
    "our conclusion is that there are no yukawa dependent terms in the renormalisation constant for @xmath16 through two loops , and we consider it likely that @xmath16 is unrenormalised at this order .",
    "in this section we present the classical form of the adjoint @xmath0 action with a superpotential in the component formalism , including the modifications suggested in ref .",

    "the main reason for setting aside the remaining graphs ( which would contribute @xmath67 terms at this loop order ) is their sheer number , namely around a hundred ; but there are other technical reasons which we shall discuss in due course .",
