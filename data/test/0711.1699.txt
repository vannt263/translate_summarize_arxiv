    "quantum information processing seeks to perform tasks which are impossible or not efficient with the use of conventional classical information processing , by using systems described by quantum mechanics .",
    "we can consider two kinds of quantum information tasks based on the types input states : the classical input tasks and the quantum input tasks . whereas input states of the classical input tasks are quantum states but encode just classical information , input states of the quantum input tasks encodes quantum information , of which unit is described by a qubit @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are unknown complex parameters satisfying @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are a fixed basis of a qubit .",
    "for example , quantum algorithms @xcite are classical input tasks and quantum error correcting codes @xcite and quantum universal optimal cloning @xcite are quantum input tasks .",
    "to investigate yet unveiled full quantum potential of quantum information processing , it is necessary to understand properties of quantum input tasks .    in many quantum input tasks , how quantum information is encoded in the larger hilbert space of composite systems determines the main functionality of the tasks .",
    "for example , in quantum error correcting codes , qubit information is encoded in a subspace of a larger hilbert space such that it can be still recovered after being influenced by certain errors ( or noises ) which map input qubit information into the whole hilbert space .",
    "the encoding process can be described by a transformation of a computational basis @xmath6 where the original quantum information is given into a set of orthogonal states in the larger hilbert space @xmath7 . in this picture , the properties of encoding for a task are captured by the choice of a set of states @xmath7 , which represents _ how _ original quantum information is spread across the hilbert spaces of subsystems .    entanglement , or a non - local quantum correlation , of an _ individual _ state is an essential resource for performing quantum input tasks such as quantum teleportation @xcite , namely , the existence of entanglement is necessary for performing teleportation beyond the classical limit . to analyze _ non - local _ properties of spread quantum information described by the set of states",
    "is a way to characterize how quantum information is spread by encoding . here , we use the word non - local to represent properties which are not fully accessible by just using local operations on the subspaces and classical communications ( locc ) but global operations on the whole systems . for individual states , the existence of this kind of non - locality is accompanied by the existence of entanglement .",
    "however , it is also known that such non - local properties of a set of states can be essentially different from non - locality of individual states .",
    "an important example is a set of nine product states which can not be locally discriminated by using locc presented in @xcite ( the `` non - locality without entanglement '' paper by bennet et al . ) . in this example",
    ", there is no entanglement in the quantum states where classical information is encoded , therefore , no entanglement resource required for encoding classical information , but it is not possible to decode ( i.e. , identify encoded classical information ) deterministically locc , without using entanglement resources .",
    "entanglement properties of each encoded state does not fully capture the non - local property appearing in the decoding process . as it had been also pointed out in the context of local copy and local state discrimination in @xcite , impossibility of tasks involving locc transformation of a set of states",
    "implies _ non - locality beyond individual entanglement_.    for characterizing non - locality of the spread of quantum information , non - local resources required for decoding quantum information should be considered as well as for encoding quantum information , since required minimum resources for encoding process and decoding process are not necessary the same in locc transformations . in this paper , we focus on non - local resources required for decoding processes and investigate properties of an extreme case of spreading quantum information that does not consume non - local resources for decoding .",
    "we study a simple but fundamental case of spreading qubit information into two - party states .",
    "we present necessary and sufficient conditions for spreading qubit information into bipartite states such that qubit information can be extracted by only using locc between the two parties .",
    "we call this task _ remote extraction_. in this task , since we have to investigate simultaneous transformations of _ two _ states @xmath8 under all possible locc , unlike the case of a single known pure bipartite state where lo - popescu theorem @xcite is applicable , the proof of necessity is involved and it consists of seven steps",
    ". we also present the explicit form of the locc for achieving the perfect remote extraction .",
    "interestingly , the obtained conditions indicate that qubit information can be asymmetrically spread into a bipartite state .",
    "[ fig : asymmetricloccextraction ] ) .",
    "there is a way of encoding to spread qubit information where it can be remotely extracted with unit probability at one of the parties but not at the other as long as they are using locc .",
    "thus , we can introduce a non - local property of a set of states in an asymmetric manner for two parties , whereas entanglement properties of an _ individual _ bipartite pure state are always symmetric between the two parties due to schmidt decomposition .",
    "this fact is another indication of the difference of non - locality of a set of states and an individual state .",
    ", width=283 ]    the asymmetric property of spreading quantum information can be used for controlling the transmission of quantum information .",
    "namely , we can distribute quantum information such that one of the party , say alice , can act as a controller of quantum information to support other party to extract full quantum information , but she can not obtain full quantum information for herself , as long as they are acting by locc .",
    "therefore we can consider a simple two qubit device which globally encodes qubit information and also acts as a local `` switch '' for transmission of qubit information to one of the qubits .",
    "from the viewpoint of controlling transmission of quantum information , it is also useful to spread quantum information into two parties such that alice s local operation can _ irreversibly destroy _ quantum information such that the state of bob s qubit after alice s operation is set to a _",
    "pure _ state which does not contain quantum information , i.e. the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 . note that this process is not a randomizing process to transform bob s qubit to be in a completely mixed state . in this task",
    ", a part of classical information of the parameter @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be retrieved .",
    "we call this task _ remote destruction_. ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loccdestruction ] ) such a way for spreading quantum information can be used another kind of `` switch '' for controlling quantum information transmission . using a similar technique for proving conditions of remote extraction",

    "all the measurements that bob carries out @xmath69 are scalar multiplications of unitary operators .    from the theorem",

    "( [ ov ] ) .",
    "the case of @xmath79 presents an interesting picture how qubit information is spread between two parties in terms of symmetry and asymmetry ; for @xmath72 , qubit information is already extracted at bob from the beginning , and no qubit information can be extracted at alice by locc , for @xmath80 , qubit information is symmetrically shared between alice and bob , and for @xmath81 , qubit information is shared but asymmetrically .",
    "we note that bob s operation is restricted to scalar multiplication of unitary operators for extracting qubit information at bob .",

    "the measurement condition also implies that one - way locc , where alice performs a projective measurement on her qubit in the @xmath82 basis and bob performs a conditional unitary operation depending on alice s measurement outcome is sufficient for remote extraction of qubit information .",
    "the task of remote destruction is to _ irreversibly _ destroy spread qubit information by acting one of the party ( alice ) and to prevent extracting quantum information at the other party ( bob ) .",

    ", we evaluate the conditions of the basis states for the existence of e - measurements .",
    "we have derived necessary and sufficient conditions for basis states for encoding and the explicit form of measurements .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for remote extraction indicate the possibility of sharing qubit information between two parties in an asymmetric manner , namely , we can spread qubit information such that it can be remotely extracted to only one of the parties by using locc but not to the other party .",
    "since impossibility of locc tasks implies the existence of a kind of non - locality , the possibility of asymmetric qubit information sharing indicates that such non - locality can be asymmetric between two parties .",
    "the obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for remote destruction indicate that such asymmetric non - locality for irreversibly destroying qubit information can also be introduced , but the conditions for asymmetric cases are not compatible with those for remote extraction .",
    "remote destruction by one of the parties is possible if and only if remote extraction at that party is possible .",
    "if we consider alice s system in our model as an environment , it is a similar situation to _ quantum lost and found _ considered by gregoretti and werner in @xcite . in their paper , they have obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for extracting quantum information spread over the system and environment due to the system - environment coupling , by measuring the environment and performing conditional operations on the system . by using quantum information theoretical analysis , they have proven that extraction is possible if and only if when a map @xmath15 for the system state @xmath427 can be represented by the random unitary channel @xmath428 , where @xmath429 is a set of random unitary operators acting on the system qubit , and @xmath430 is probability satisfying @xmath431 .",
    "we note that our remote extraction can be regarded as a special case where both the system and environment consist of a single qubit , however we consider the conditions for general locc whereas they consider only one - way ( from the environment to the system ) locc for quantum information extraction . in the case of the single qubit system - environment ,",
    "a purification of the map @xmath15 gives a corresponding transformation describing the spread of qubit information to the two parties , the system and environment ; @xmath432 for arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath433 is an orthonormal basis of the environment .",
    "they are equivalent to our locc extraction conditions for basis states given by eqs .",
