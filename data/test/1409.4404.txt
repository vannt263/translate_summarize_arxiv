    "recently , there has been a great deal of activity aimed at studying the synchronization of coupled oscillators of diverse nature @xcite .",
    "the theory of synchronization implies that even in uncoupled state the individual elementary units exhibit self - sustained oscillations",
    ". however no less interesting are the systems where local coupling is essential for the very generation of oscillations and not only for their modulation or phase adjustment .    as far back as in early 1970s , smale @xcite constructed a counterintuitive mathematical example of a biological cell modeled by the chemical kinetics of four metabolites , @xmath0 , such that the reaction equations @xmath1 for the set of metabolites , @xmath2 , had a globally stable equilibrium .",
    "the cell is `` dead '' , in that the concentrations of its metabolites always tend to the same fixed levels .",
    "when two such cells are coupled by linear diffusion terms of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a diagonal matrix with the elements @xmath5 , however , the resulting equations are shown to have a globally stable limit cycle .",
    "the concentrations of the metabolites begin to oscillate , and the system becomes `` alive '' . in smale s words :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ there is a paradoxical aspect to the example .",
    "one has two dead ( mathematically dead ) cells interacting by a diffusion process which has a tendency in itself to equalize the concentrations . yet in interaction , a state continues to pulse indefinitely .",

    ", a number of models have been proposed containing biologically plausible mechanisms by which coupling of identical nonoscillating cells could generate synchronous oscillations . among them",
    "are a model of electrically coupled cells , characterized by an excitable membrane and calcium dynamics @xcite , a model in which coupling a passive diffusive cytoplasmic bulk with an excitable membrane ( having an activator - inhibitor dynamics ) produces a self - sustained oscillatory behavior @xcite , an analog operational - amplifier implementation of neural cells connected by passive coupling ( where conductance of the resistive connection simulates the diffusion coefficient ) @xcite , etc .",
    "the authors of the last model suggested a term awakening dynamics for the phenomenon .",
    "the subject of the present paper is an emergence of collective oscillations in a system of coupled nonoscillatory consumer - resource ( cr ) pairs .",
    "owing to simplicity , this model in a sense may be considered minimal .",
    "our choice of coupled cr equations as a matter of enquiry is dictated primarily by the ubiquity and importance of cr interactions .",
    "cr models are the fundamental building blocks used in mathematical description and simulation of ecosystems . depending on a specific nature of the involved cr interactions",
    ", they can take the forms of predator - prey , plant - herbivore , parasite - host , and victim - exploiter systems @xcite .",
    "however applications of the cr models extend far beyond the ecology and are found wherever one can speak of win - loss interactions . in its broad",
    "meaning , resource is any substance which can lead to increased growth rate of the consumer as its availability in the environment is increased . as this takes place , the resource is certainly consumed .",
    "consuming the resource means tending to reduce its availability .",
    "when carefully examined , cr models are identified in the following fields : epidemiology ( susceptible and infected ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 10 ) ) , laser dynamics ( photons and electrons ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) ) , labor economics ( share of labor and employment rate @xcite ) , theoretical immunology ( antigens and b lymphocytes @xcite ) , kinetics of chain chemical reactions ( lipid molecules and free radicals @xcite ) , and in numerous other studies from diverse disciplines .",
    "we consider the situation when each of two consumer species exploits one respective resource only .",
    "as explained in appendix , terms `` consumer '' and `` resource '' in our model may bear not only their literal ecological meaning , but the physical meaning of photon density and population inversion in a laser cavity as well . both resources",
    "are being supplied with constant rates like in a chemostat and consumed according to a simple mass - action kinetics .",
    "the resources are thought to be noninteractive . when uncoupled , self - inhibition of the individual consumer population is due to intraspecific interference .",
    "the coupling is assumed to originate solely from the interspecific interference competition between the consumers and quantitatively expressed by a bilinear term combining the competitor densities .",
    "the per individual loss rate of either consumer is proportional to the density of its counterpart .",
    "representation of competition between species in terms of loss - coupling dates back to the classical model of lotka  volterra  gause ( lvg ) @xcite .",
    "the lvg model operates with carrying capacities of the species , rather than referring explicitly to any essential resources . as shown by macarthur @xcite ,",
    "lvg equations may be considered as a quasi - steady - state approximation to the cr equations accentuating resource - mediated nature of competition , under the assumption of relatively rapid dynamics of the involved resources .",
    "thereafter trophic competition have developed into a major descriptor of competition in the ecological literature generally , and in conceptualizing ecosystems as systems of coupled cr oscillators specifically @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the prevailing models of competition we consider the case of pure interspecific interference competition between the consumers with no consumption - induced contribution . actually , our model is nothing more nor less than lvg equations augmented with the rate equations for the resources .",
    "another key assumption of the model is that the dynamics of the consumers is much faster than that of the resources .",
    "from a physical perspective , by and large similar equations with the like time hierarchy ( fast consumer and slow resource ) have been in use for coupled longitudinal modes in a semiconductor laser with an intracavity - doubling crystal since the work of baer @xcite .",
    "these equations have been treated mostly numerically .",
    "the notable analytical result belongs to erneux and mandel @xcite who succeeded to show that the system admits antiphase periodic solutions by reducing it to the equations for quasi - conservative oscillator .",
    "however this result has to do with the onset of low - amplitude quasi - harmonic oscillations . unlike their study , our approach deals with well - developed high - amplitude essentially nonlinear oscillations . besides , we propose the model to be valid not only for competing laser modes , but for loss - coupled lasers as well .",
    "we analyze the model using geometric singular perturbation technique according to which the full system of equations is decomposed into fast and slow subsystems .",
    "as we shall see below , the model reveals qualitatively different behavior at intense and weak competition between the consumer species . if coupling is strong , one of the consumers wins and completely dominates .",
    "when coupling is weak , the model exhibits low - frequency antiphase relaxation oscillations with each species alternatively taking the dominant role .",
    "the two - consumer , two - resource model we consider is the following nondimensional system of four ordinary differential equations :    [ coupled - uv ] @xmath6    here dots indicate differentiation with respect to the nondimensional time variable @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are quantities measuring the respective population sizes of @xmath11th resource and @xmath11th consumer , @xmath12 ( @xmath10 ) is the inflow rate of @xmath11th resource , @xmath13 is a parameter representing consumer self - limitation , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) quantifies the inhibitory effect of @xmath17th consumer on the growth of @xmath11th consumer due to coupling , and @xmath18 is a singular perturbation parameter indicating that the dynamics of the consumers is much faster than that of the resources .",
    "it should be mentioned that being proportional to its dimensional prototype , @xmath9 directly represents population density of consumer species and is always nonnegative .",
    "quantity @xmath8 , however , is not a population size in the true sense of the word .",
    "it is rather an affine transformation of a population size of the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are scaling constants .",
    "this is done for reasons of mathematical convenience . unlike a purely linear transformation",
    ", an affine map does not preserve the zero point , so in @xmath22 corresponds to zero population size in reality .",
    "nevertheless , from here on we shall apply the term `` resource '' to @xmath8 for brevity .    for more details and discussion on the derivation of the model from different perspectives the reader",
    "is referred to appendix .",
    "when @xmath23 , the communities are uncoupled and completely independent .",
    "an isolated cr pair is governed by equations    [ isolated - uv ] @xmath24    there exist two nonnegative steady states :    [ steady - uv ] @xmath25    the linearization of takes the form @xmath26 where ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) is one of the above steady states .    at , one eigenvalue is negative and one is positive : @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "thus is a saddle point . at ,",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 , so the steady state is a stable node / focus .",
    "specifically , focus is the case for @xmath33 whence one obtains an asymptotic estimate @xmath34 fig .",
    "[ fig01]c illustrates this focus - node bifurcation numerically .",
    "damped oscillations is a well - known inherent feature of the photon - carrier dynamics in class - b lasers .",
    "an isolated cr system admits therefore , only solution which tends asymptotically towards the unique steady state .",
    "periodic solutions are excluded .",
    "however the temporal dynamics of approaching this steady state essentially depends on the interplay between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and is worth another look .",
    "there are in fact three timescales , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , involved in the cr system when it is overdamped , and two@xmath37 and @xmath38when underdamped .",
    "system is singularly perturbed because the derivative of one of its state variables , @xmath40 , is multiplied by a small positive parameter @xmath35 .",
    "singular perturbation cause two - time - scale behavior of the system characterized by the presence of slow and fast transients in the system s response to external stimuli .    replacing @xmath7 in with a fast time variable @xmath41 and setting @xmath42",
    "we obtain the fast subsystem    [ isolated - fast ] @xmath43    where prime means differentiation with respect to @xmath44 . in the stretched timescale @xmath44 the slow resource variable @xmath45 , according to , is replaced by its initial value and reckoned as constant parameter .",
    "equation is of a logistic type which has the solution @xmath46 valid for @xmath47 .    after a lapse of considerable time ( in the fast scale )",
    "@xmath40 converges to either of two fixed points depending on a sign of @xmath45 : @xmath48 it means that every single trajectory starting within the positive quadrant of @xmath49 plane far enough from the stable steady state will run almost parallel to the vertical axis and hit the line @xmath50 practically in a finite time of order @xmath37 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01]a  b .",
    "now set @xmath42 in to get the slow subsystem    [ isolated - slow ] @xmath51    the equation describes a slow manifold consisting of two lines in the @xmath49 plane : @xmath52 and @xmath53 . by ,",
    "the former attracts all the trajectories in the first quadrant , while the latter  all those in the second .",
    "inasmuch as the quasi - steady state of , @xmath54 , is an isolated root of and @xmath28 is a stable solution of for any @xmath55 , the assumptions of tikhonov s theorem @xcite are satisfied , and one may proceed to approximate @xmath45 and @xmath40 in terms of the solution of the reduced system in the slow timescale .",
    "it means that after arriving at the slow manifold @xmath52 , the representing point of the full system will move along the manifold toward the equilibrium point with a characteristic velocity of order @xmath38 .    in the immediate proximity to equilibrium the behavior of the trajectory",
    "is determined by the type of the fixed point , whether it is a node or a focus .",
    "eventually this depends on the value of @xmath36 .",
    "namely , close to a stable node , the system has two distinct real negative eigenvalues , one fast ( @xmath56 ) , and one slow ( @xmath57 ) : @xmath58 since @xmath59 , trajectories starting off the associated eigenvector 2 ( which is tangent to the slow manifold @xmath52 ) converge to that vector along lines almost parallel to eigenvector 1 ( which is parallel to the vertical axis @xmath40 ) .",
    "as they approach vector 2 they become tangent to it and move along it up to the very nodal point ( fig .  [",
    "fig01]a ) .",
    "the characteristic time constant of this final stage is of order @xmath39 .    in the vicinity of a stable focus",
    "the motion is qualitatively different : trajectories still keep converging to the equilibrium , but no longer follow the slow manifold @xmath52 ( fig .  [ fig01]b ) .",
    "the reason is that for a focus eigenvectors are complex .",
    "recalling that condition must be true for a focus , calculate the eigenvalues in a limit case of @xmath60 : @xmath61 loosely speaking , one may think that near a focal point separation of state variables into slow and fast ones ceases to have its conventional meaning .",
    "there is no point to talk about motion along the slow manifold since there are no reduced one - dimensional systems corresponding to the neighborhood of a focus .",
    "the perturbation parameter @xmath35 affects only the frequency of damped oscillation , but not the damping rate .",
    "the radius of the focal spiral uniformly shrinks with a time constant of order @xmath38 .",
    "to @xmath38 for small @xmath36 there is a way to recast the equations near the focal equilibrium @xmath62 in a convenient form where the perturbation parameter @xmath35 does not multiply any right hand side .",
    "namely , performing the scaling @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , one obtains @xmath67 here dots stand for differentiation with respect to the time variable @xmath68 .",
    "equations represent a weakly perturbed hamiltonian system . for @xmath69",
    "the system is pure hamiltonian and admits the first integral @xmath70 which is a conserved quantity ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the periodic solutions of the hamiltonian system form a one - parameter family with the equilibrium @xmath72 as center point .",
    "the condition @xmath73 makes equations quasi - conservative with phase trajectories slowly spiralling to the equilibrium ( fig .  [ fig02 ] ) .    system can be rewritten as a second order differential equation for @xmath74 only : @xmath75 this is the equation for a nonlinear quasi - conservative oscillator .",
    "as is seen from , for @xmath76 and @xmath77 the oscillator is not only quasi - conservative , but also a quasi - linear with the frequency @xmath78 .",
    "these conditions motivate introducing the new variable @xmath79 . as a result",
    "one obtains @xmath80 this equation of quasi - conservative , quasi - linear oscillator will be used later on when analyzing the onset of synchronous periodicity .      in the following ,",

    "such a kind of transient oscillations is known as `` ringing '' .",

    "@xmath181 is increasing , like @xmath180 did in part 1 ;    @xmath181 surpasses the losses , @xmath183 emerges and the subsequent cross - losses cause @xmath182 to wash out .",
    "the spiking @xmath183 also causes a substantial decrease in the available stock of the associated resource .",
    "the sequence begins again .    presenting",
    "his famous model smale remarked that `` it is more difficult to reduce the number of chemicals to two or even three '' @xcite .",
    "as distinct from smale s example , coupling in our case makes self - sustained synchronous oscillations possible for just two variables .",
    "as we have seen , phase trajectory of the system constantly moves from the neighborhood of unstable boundary equilibrium @xmath92 where only consumer 1 is present , to the neighborhood of @xmath93 where consumer 2 completely dominates , back to @xmath92 , and so on in cyclic alternation .",
    "this kind of trajectory was termed `` heteroclinic cycle '' by kirlinger @xcite .",
    "a heteroclinic cycle occurs when the outflow ( unstable manifold ) from one saddle point is directly connected to the inflow ( stable manifold ) of another saddle point , and vice versa .",
    "it is closely related to another notion of the nonlinear dynamics , a homoclinic cycle , which emerges when the unstable and the stable manifolds of the same saddle coincide and form a closed loop .",
    "homo- and heteroclinic cycles are not robust structures in the sense that infinitesimally small change of system parameters destroy them .",
    "however in the practical sense , any limit cycle passing in close proximity to saddle points will be indistinguishable from a heteroclinic cycle ( fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] ) .",
    "the only difference is strict periodicity , although the period of the limit cycle in a neighborhood of the heteroclinic cycle may be long .",
    "besides , at the threshold of homo-/heteroclinic bifurcation the period is susceptible to external noise .    in the context of our model , as coupling becomes stronger , the stable limit cycle swells and passes closer and closer to boundary fixed points which are node - saddles or focus - saddles ( fig .",
    "[ fig04]d  f ) .",
    "depending on the interplay between the parameters , eventually it may bang into one or both of these equilibria creating either a homoclinic or heteroclinic cycle , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath238 and @xmath239 . on further increasing the coupling , the saddle connection breaks and the loop",
    "is destroyed .",
    "it is worth noting that heteroclinic cycles were first found by may and leonard @xcite in a classical lvg system with competing three species .",
    "however in their model the cycle is not truly periodic : as time goes on , the system tends to stay in the neighborhood of any one boundary equilibrium ever longer , so that the `` total time spent in completing one cycle is likewise proportional to the length of time the system has been running . '' moreover , may and leonard state that `` the phenomenon clearly requires at least three competitors , which is why it can not occur in models with two competitors . ''",
    "this statement is echoed by vandermeer @xcite who extended their theory on higher dimensions : `` it appears to be the case that all cases of an odd number of species follow this basic pattern , whereas all cases of even number of species result in extinction of half of the components , leaving the other half living independently at their carrying capacities . '' in view of our results , the above conclusion is by far and away true providing one stays within the framework of classical lvg equations , which in fact imply a high rapidity of the resource dynamics . in our model of just two competitors",
    "the slowness of the resource relative to the consumer is essential for the oscillations to occur , because it provides the necessary inertia to the system .",
    "physically , our model is most likely feasible because it is based on the well - established rate equations for semiconductor lasers , and therefore should be considered as a model of anti - phase synchronization of two lasers via their loss - coupling .",
    "ecologically , the feasibility of the model is tightly bound to justification of the adopted time hierarchy in system .",
    "time scales are usually inverted in ecosystems , as opposed to lasers , the most common case being rapid consumption of food by species .",
    "however it seems reasonable to propose that our model may describe the first level of an ecosystem , at which the consumers are autotrophs and the resources are mineral nutrients .",
    "the ability to exploit different substrates leads to a possibility of stable coexistence of different organisms descending from the common ancestor .",
    "divergent evolution is just the formation of new species : due to mutations two populations emerge with the same genetic code but having proteins able to process different substrates . providing the environmental conditions are quite stable on the evolutionary timescale ,",
    "the inflows of inorganic substrates from the surroundings may be considered constant and the washout time of a substrate may occur much longer than the life expectancy of a species ( recall the definition of @xmath35 from ) .",
    "we proposed a model of two cr pairs linked by interspecific interference competition .",
    "when uncoupled , an individual cr pair has a unique stable steady state and does not admit periodic solutions . if intraspecific interference within the species is strong enough , the equilibrium is nonoscillatory ( stable node ) , otherwise the steadying occurs by decaying oscillations ( stable focus ) .",
    "when coupled , the model behaves differently at strong and weak competitive interaction between the consumers . when coupling is strong , one of the consumers wins . which consumer wins or loses depends critically on the relative intensities of the resource inflows and coupling strengths . in the case of bistability ,",
    "when the system acts like a bistable multivibrator ( flip - flop circuit ) , the winner may be determined by the initial conditions .",
    "any static coexistence of competing consumers is not possible .",
    "when coupling is moderately weak , the model reveals low - frequency antiphase relaxation oscillations represented by a continuous flow of rectangular pulses .",
    "the system works as an astable multivibrator continually switching between its two states , neither of which is stable .",
    "the consumers can not coexist even dynamically : in each of two alternating states one consumer completely dominates and the other is on the verge of extinction . the most intriguing feature of the model is that each of the participating cr pairs taken separately does not oscillate ; both communities are completely quiescent , however , in interaction , when coupled in a nonlinear way , the resulting system turns into a relaxation oscillator .    one way or the other",
    ", it is believed that the proposed model for coupling - induced oscillations in nonoscillatory cr pairs can be considered as a minimal in that class of population - dynamical systems and its mechanism can be applied to networks with large numbers of nonoscillatory elements and complex architecture .",
    "the author declares that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper .",
    "of all types of interactions between individuals of the same population ( intraspecific interactions ) or individuals of different populations ( interspecific interactions ) of the same trophic level competition is most commonly encountered . in a broad sense , competition takes place when each species ( individual ) has an inhibiting effect on the growth of the other species ( individual ) . an inhibiting effect",

    "cr model assumes that competition within and between consumer species is purely exploitative : individuals and populations interact through utilizing ( or occupying ) common resource that is in short supply .",
    "quite on the contrary , lvg model describes competition strictly phenomenologically , as direct interference where consumers experience harm attributed to their mutual presence in a habitat ( e.g. through aggressive behavior ) .",
    "however we have to stress that neither macarthur s reduction claims that interference competition entirely results from `` more fundamental '' trophic competition , nor it urges us to hastily consider direct competition as some derived concept .",
    "what it actually states is that at slow - time scale associated with dynamics of the consumers , the effects of exploitation competition are indistinguishable from those of interference competition .",

    "since then , a whole series of theoretical papers have been published on two - predator , two - prey systems with interference competition between two self - reproducting prey species based on the lotka  volterra equations .",
    "specifically , kirlinger @xcite describes the model in which each predator specializes on one prey only , while xiang and song @xcite treat a similar model in which each predator is allowed to feed on both prey .",
    "a second assumption of our equations is that the consumers interact only directly , through interference competition , and can not compete through their use of resources , as each consumer specializes on one resource only .",
    "the theory of pure trophic competition in equable models has been developed in the works @xcite .",
    "intraspecific interference competition is allowed within the consumers as well . even though the available amount of any resource happened to be of a constant level , the population size of the associated consumer would remain finite due to self - limitation caused by direct intraspecific interference .",
    "the novelty of model is that it considers time hierarchy of macarthur s cr equations to be reversed by assuming dynamics of the consumers to be much faster than that of the involved resources and articulates the importance of direct competition mechanisms within the framework of this assumption .          the parameters @xmath274 , @xmath275 and @xmath276 reflect the rapidity of the dynamics of @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 with reference to that of @xmath180",
