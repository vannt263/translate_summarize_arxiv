    "quantum protocols outperform their classical counterparts by taking advantage of quantum resources , the most well - known of which is quantum entanglement  @xcite used for quantum key distribution  @xcite , quantum dense coding  @xcite , quantum teleportation  @xcite , and gravitational wave detection  @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is of great importance to have easy approaches for entanglement generation and detection .",
    "arguably , the simplest way of generating entanglement is to use a beam splitter ( bs ) . whether the input beams are two rays of photons  @xcite or two rays of atoms  @xcite , it is of fundamental interest to ask when does a bs generate entangled outputs .",
    "it is also well - known that a bs transforms separable fock states into modal entangled binomial states , while it leaves separable coherent states unentangled  @xcite .",
    "such relations were first considered by kim _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and it was proven by wang  @xcite that the ability of a bs to produce entangled outputs is closely connected to the nonclassical properties of the input states : the entanglement in the output of a linear optical network implies the nonclassicality in the phase - space representation of the inputs .",
    "this , indeed , revealed a necessary relation between the two notions of entanglement detection and nonclassicality , which was used to quantify the input nonclassicality via measuring the entanglement of the output  @xcite . in this direction , a nice study relating distillable entanglement detection to photon statistics nonclassicality is given in ref .",
    "further investigations led to a complete understanding of the entanglement - nonclassicality correspondence from the perspective of gaussian states and distillable entanglement  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has recently been shown that if the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0-functions of pure product inputs to a @xmath1-port connected linear optical network are nonclassical , then the output will almost always exhibit entanglement  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , a peculiar situation exists in which the entanglement  nonclassicality correspondence breaks down : whenever two squeezed states with parallel squeezing axes interact on a balanced beam splitter , they will be transformed into separable product states although they are considered to be highly nonclassical .    to reconsider the mutual relation between entanglement generation ( detection ) and nonclassicality",
    ", we need an appropriate criterion for entanglement detection .",
    "there are several criteria for verification of entanglement ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , probably the most famous one is the partial transposition criterion  @xcite .",
    "there is another extensively studied approach , the so - called entanglement witnessing , which provides a necessary and sufficient condition  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of entanglement witnesses ( ews ) is that they allow us to detect entanglement without full information about the quantum state by measuring statistics of a finite number of quantum observables .",
    "different types of bell inequalities , for instance , are ews to test nonlocality  @xcite .",
    "such observables are relatively easy to construct in low dimensions , while generally very hard in high dimensional hilbert spaces , e.g. for continuous variable ( cv ) systems . despite that there are efficient methods for optimization of ews in bipartite and even multipartite scenarios  @xcite ,",
    "there exist a few methods for ew construction ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", however , we use an ew construction to be applied to our particular problem .    in this contribution",
    ", we derive a _ sufficient _ condition for the phase - space nonclassicality of at least one of the input states to a bs to guarantee the entanglement of the output modes , regardless of the other input state .",
    "remarkably , our criterion immediately removes any assumptions about the purity or the separability of the inputs .",
    "such a simple entanglement generation criterion allows one to easily design schemes for technically difficult tasks such as high particle number entanglement generation .",
    "for example , we prove that a single - photon state of sufficient purity generates entanglement from any state , e.g. an arbitrarily high temperature thermal state , upon incidence on any bs .",
    "we also re - examine entanglement detection stage and show that entanglement can be imprinted onto a single - mode in the form of phase - space negativities . in other words , detecting negativities of marginal phase - space functions , e.g. using homodyne detection , at the output of a bs provides a simple criterion for local entanglement verification .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with introducing our ew construction approach in sec .",
    "[ secii ] together with a detailed account of its properties . in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] we derive our sufficient criterion for transforming nonclassicality to entanglement and vice versa using an arbitrary bs .",
    "the extensive discussion of the results and their implications is given in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] . to study the effect of loss on the generation and detection of entanglement",
    ", we study the explicit example of a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) with lossy arms in sec .",
    "a summary and conclusions are provided in sec .",
    "[ secvi ] .",
    "[ secii ]    let us start with introducing our ew construction procedure .",
    "consider a @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space @xmath3 and the linear vector space @xmath4 of linear operators acting on @xmath3 , endowed with hilbert - schmidt inner product @xmath5 .",
    "denote the subset of @xmath4 consisting of linear operators with finite norm as @xmath6 and the space of quantum states @xmath7 as the subset of @xmath6 for which all members are positive and normalized .",
    "thus , we have the hierarchy of spaces as @xmath8",
    ".    any linear functional from @xmath6 to @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 for some @xmath11 for all @xmath12 via the celebrated riesz theorem .",
    "suppose that the set @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is any basis set for @xmath6 such that @xmath15 .",
    "we call the set of operators @xmath16 dual to @xmath17 if @xmath18 this simple construction allows us to expand any quantum state in either of the bases as @xmath19 for two arbitrary quantum states @xmath20 , the cauchy - schwarz inequality reads as @xmath21 where we have used the facts that density operators are positive and @xmath22 for any quantum state .",
    "now , expanding @xmath23 in @xmath24 basis and @xmath25 in @xmath26 basis using eqs .   and   gives @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , suppose that @xmath30 is a bounded positive definite superoperator defined as @xmath31 such that @xmath32 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath33 are thus given by @xmath34 .",
    "it is clear that the modulus of @xmath35 is bounded by @xmath36 .",
    "multiplying each term of the sum in eq .",
    "with @xmath35 preserves the inequality with the upper bound @xmath36 , and thus , @xmath37 consequently , we state the following ew construction procedure from arbitrary set of local operators .",
    "a.   choose an arbitrary basis set @xmath38 ( @xmath14 ) for @xmath6 corresponding to the set of dual operators @xmath16 .",
    "b.   choose a bounded positive definite superoperator ( pseudo - metric ) @xmath30 with matrix elements @xmath39 .",
    "c.   define the hermitian witness operator to be @xmath40    one can simply verify that a bipartite quantum system living in the @xmath41-dimensional state space @xmath42 is entangled if @xmath43.\\ ] ] this is because , according to the above discussion , for any separable state of the form @xmath44 with @xmath45 one has @xmath46 .",
    "let us investigate the properties of the above class of witnesses under local maps .",
    "for this purpose , suppose that the map @xmath47 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , where @xmath50 is the identity of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , has been applied to the set of separable states so that @xmath53 is an unnormalized separable operator for any separable state @xmath54 .",
    "thus , @xmath55 if and only if the map @xmath56 is a positive map sending quantum states to ( unnormalized ) positive operators .",
    "now , corresponding to any map @xmath57 the adjoint map @xmath58 is defined such that @xmath59 for all @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , positivity of @xmath57 implies the positivity of the adjoint map and vice versa .",
    "this , in turn , implies that @xmath61 : any positive map preserves the witnessing property of @xmath62 with respect to the lower bounded inequality .",
    "what can we say about the upper bound @xmath63 ?",
    "given that @xmath47 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) is a positive map , we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is a legitimate separable quantum state .",
    "consequently , @xmath67 if and only if @xmath68 : we are allowed to apply local maps which are trace - non - increasing positive ( tnip ) to the set of separable states .",
    "passing to the positive adjoint map @xmath69 we have @xmath70 .",
    "in addition , @xmath56 must preserve the hermiticity which imposes the kraus representation @xmath71 with @xmath72 so that the adjoint map will be given by @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "thus , the trace - non - increasing property gives @xmath74 that is the adjoint map must be sub - unital . in summary , we are allowed to apply local maps which are sub - unital positive ( sup ) to any witness of the form   preserving the upper bound in eq .  .",
    "it is also worth noticing that , for both cases discussed above , the map @xmath69 should necessarily be entanglement - non - breaking ( enb ) to preserve the witnessing capability of @xmath62 . in particular , the partial transposition operation is a trace - non - increasing positive but not completely positive ( and thus sup ) map which is also enb , preserving the witnessing property of the operators in eq  .    in the following ,",
    "we show another important property of our construction ; it is basis set independent and it is uniquely determined by the pseudo - metric @xmath33 . consider an invertible map @xmath75 and its dual @xmath76 which is defined so that it preserves the duality condition  : @xmath77 hence , it can be easily verified that @xmath78 thus , the witness operator in eq .   is @xmath79 invariant for any invertible map @xmath58 .",
    "it is also clear that all basis sets for @xmath6 can be transformed to each other via an invertible map @xmath58they are all isomorphic to each other . in other words , by choosing a fixed metric @xmath33 , the outcome of the witnessing procedure is independent of the chosen bases .",
    "the above considerations imply that the hermitian operator @xmath62 in eq .   can be a bipartite entanglement witness for any choice of the basis set @xmath17 .",
    "accordingly , we may consider a typical local orthogonal rank - one ( self - dual ) basis set @xmath80 and construct the ew @xmath81 where the metric is chosen to be the identity superoperator .",
    "any other basis set @xmath17 and its dual set @xmath82 can be obtained from @xmath83 using two dual invertible maps , @xmath58 and @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , we may note that @xmath62 is the choi matrix of the identity map .",
    "notably , all arguments of this section equally hold for infinite dimensional hilbert spaces , because both the riesz theorem and cauchy - schwarz inequality hold for any banach space .",
    "a relevant subtle point here is that , in the infinite or very high dimensional cases , one is not able to measure an infinite number of basis elements in practice .",
    "we close this section by proving that our construction method can be equally applied to a subset of bases elements .",
    "any operator of the form  , constructed from any subset of the basis set , @xmath85 , satisfies the necessary condition of the entanglement witness eq .",
    "provided that it spans a subset of the state space @xmath86 .    without loss of generality , we assume a finite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the set @xmath87 is convex and endowed with a set of rank - one projection generators @xmath88 in a one to - to - one correspondence with @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "let us call @xmath91 the state space generated by the span of the basis set @xmath92 .",
    "in the same way , @xmath91 is the convex hull of rank - one projections @xmath93 .",
    "the whole convex set @xmath7 is generated by @xmath94 .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , there exists a decomposition @xmath96 with @xmath97 $ ] , @xmath98 and @xmath99 for all @xmath100 .",
    "we conclude the proof with noticing that the projection of any state @xmath100 onto @xmath87 is the legitimate density operator @xmath101 , and the proof for the conditions of witness operator   holds for it .",
    "that is , given the witness @xmath102 and for any product state @xmath103 where @xmath104 with",
    "@xmath105 $ ] , @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 , one has @xmath109 the generalization to @xmath44 with @xmath45 is straightforward .",
    "[ seciii ]    in what follows , as the main result of this paper , we construct an ew and apply it to the output of a bs to obtain a sufficient criterion for entanglement generation and detection .",
    "a useful witness operator of type   can be constructed from @xmath110-ordered displacement operator @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "the parameter values @xmath114 correspond to anti - normal , weyl - wigner and normal orderings , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath110-parametrized characteristic function of the state @xmath115 is given by @xmath116 .",
    "we also have the duality relation @xmath117 and thus the dual operator to @xmath118 is @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , we may replace the sum in eq .   by integration over the whole complex plane and",
    "construct the following @xmath110-parameterized witness operator , @xmath120 here , the corresponding pseudo - metric @xmath33 is chosen to be the identity , and @xmath121 and @xmath122 act on @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .    to find a sufficient criterion for entanglement generation by a bs , we apply a specially modified version of the witness   to the output of a bs .",
    "then , using a retrodictive calculation we investigate the violation of the witness inequality in terms of the input sates ; cf .",
    "[ mzint ] ( a ) .",
    "first , we consider the witness operator   for @xmath125 .",

    "notice that , as we will be testing the lower bounded witnessing inequality , positivity of the map @xmath58 is sufficient for the upcoming analysis .",
    "this gives the modified witness @xmath132 finally , given a bs of transitivity @xmath133 and reflectivity @xmath134  in short a ( @xmath135)-bs , we apply the witness @xmath136 to its output .",
    "one finds the expectation value of the witness operator for any input state to be @xmath137 where we have used the beam splitter transformation @xmath138 together with the definition @xmath139 for the @xmath110-parametrized wigner operator such that @xmath140 is the @xmath110-parametrized quasiprobability distribution ( qpd ) of the state @xmath115  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "@xmath141 if and only if @xmath142 . moreover , if @xmath143 at some phase - space point @xmath144 , we may shift the witness operator using an appropriate local displacement operation to the point @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and obtain a negative value for @xmath146 without changing the entanglement content of the state . to obtain the similar condition on the marginal qpds of the first input , we only need to apply the map @xmath58 of eq .",
    "( without the transposition @xmath128 ) to the first mode of @xmath147 to get the modified witness @xmath148 .",
    "a retrodictive evaluation at the input thus gives @xmath149 implying that @xmath150 if and only if @xmath151 which can be further generalized to any phase - space point @xmath144 .    for the case of @xmath152 , although the map @xmath58 of eq .",
    "is no longer positive , we can alternatively apply the legitimate map @xmath153 to the second mode of @xmath127 to get a third witness @xmath154 .",
    "this gives the counterpart of eq .   as @xmath155 and thus , negativity of @xmath156-parametrized marginal of the first input implies the entanglement of the output . to obtain a similar condition on the second input mode in this case",
    ", one should apply @xmath157 to the first mode of @xmath147 to get the appropriate witness .",
    "taking into account the possibility of a complex valued transitivity , we can combine all the conditions above into one negativity condition : @xmath158 .",
    "in short , negativities of at least one of the marginal @xmath110-parametrized qpds for @xmath159 at the input ( output ) to a @xmath160-bs implies the entanglement of the output ( input ) .",
    "there are several interesting implications by the results in previous section which we will discuss one by one .",
    "the first important thing to notice is that , our condition is a sufficient one . that is , for instance , a negative marginal wigner function at the input to a balanced bs guarantees the entanglement of the output modes , nevertheless , it is not necessary for inputs to possess nonclassical wigner functions to produce entangled outputs .",
    "the second important message is that , concerning the properties of the input state , one can see that there is no need to inject pure , product , or separable states into the bs",
    ". the input can even be entangled , and if one of the marginal qpds satisfies the above condition the entanglement will be preserved by the bs .",
    "more interestingly , it is sufficient that the criterion is satisfied by only one of the input modes , regardless of what quantum state is being injected into the other port of the bs .",
    "the conclusion from this fact is that a pure single photon will generates entanglement upon mixing with any quantum state on any bs , because except its @xmath161-function , corresponding to a fully transitive or reflective bs , all of its qpds possess negativities . in particular , in an optical arrangement ,",
    "high photon number entangled states are of special interest , because their large number of photons make them efficient for interactions .",
    "a way for obtaining such states is by mixing a single photon with a coherent state on a bs  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , using our criterion , it turns out that the input state to the other port of the bs can be any state , e.g. a bright thermal state of arbitrarily high temperature . in this scenario ,",
    "the high number of photons from the thermal state split into two classically distinguishable rays while getting entangled due to the negativity of the injected single photon .",
    "this is just like nonclassicality being imprinted onto the output modes as entanglement .",
    "let us also discuss the inverse case , where entanglement of the input state imposes the marginal nonclassicality on the outputs .",
    "the main problem in applying ews to cv systems is the extreme difficulty of coincidence measurements due to the high number of dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , there are entangled states for which one does not need coincidence measurements to verify their entanglement when the verification is done locally .",
    "it suffices to interact the two rays on an arbitrary bs , perform homodyne measurements separately on both outputs and check the negativity of the reduced qpds which is much easier ; cf . fig .",
    "[ mzint ] ( b ) .",
    "that is , we may reverse the generation process and verify the entanglement of the input . in practice",
    ", there is even no need for a full state reconstruction to verify nonclassicality of qpds , as they can also be detected using appropriate witnesses much more simply than entanglement  @xcite .",
    "operationally speaking , this technique contains no measurement of correlated events between the two modes .",
    "another lesson we learn from this fact is that no matter how much nonclassicality has been separably injected into the bs , the output will always exhibit classical @xmath110-parametrized marginal qpds for @xmath162 . in this way",
    ", negativities of the qpds can be considered as information carriers about the entanglement of the source .",
    "[ secv ]    as a final word , we consider the evolution and verification of the entanglement generated via satisfying our nonclassicality criterion when the state traverses through a lossy mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) ( see e.g. fig .  [ mzint ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "suppose that we inject a state with nonclassical wigner function into the first port of a balanced bs to generate entanglement and expect to receive it at the first port of the output ( @xmath135)-bs . it is known that a lossy channel will transform anti - normally ordered displacement operators as @xmath163 where @xmath164 quantifies the loss   represents a completely lossy channel while @xmath165 is used for a perfectly lossless channel . ] .",
    "at the other end of the mzi , we are interested in parameters for the output bs such that most of the effect from the state in the second input port is canceled . we have shown in details in the appendix  [ app ] that the best choice of the output bs parameters , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , are @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the losses of the first and second arms , respectively .",
    "consequently , the detected marginal output is @xmath169 where @xmath170 .",
    "equation   clearly represents a gaussian degrading of the output to a qpd of @xmath171 .",
    "the very interesting situation would then occur if the loss is symmetric in both arms ( @xmath172 ) for which using eq .",
    "the output bs should be balanced , there will be no gaussian smoothing effect , and we get @xmath173 this represents the regime in which the negativity degrades quadratically with loss as @xmath174 goes to zero ( total loss in both arms ) .",
    "in fact , as long as there is not @xmath175 loss in both channels , any negativity at the input will ultimately survive and can be detected at the output , although it can be very small .",
    "the effect shown here is a generalization of the similar phenomena for single photon and gaussian entanglement where very large losses in each mode makes the entanglement vanishingly small , but do not destroy it until the mode is completely blocked .",
    "the example of a lossy single - photon entangled state is given in appendix  [ spapp ] .",
    "[ secvi ]    in conclusion , we found a sufficient nonclassicality condition for an arbitrary beam splitter ( bs ) to generate entanglement .",
    "we also found a sufficient nonclassicality condition for the marginal outputs of a bs to ensure entanglement of the input state . to achieve this goal ,",
    "first , we introduced a proper entanglement witness ( ew ) construction method from arbitrary local bases sets of operators .",
    "we have extensively discussed the properties of our construction scheme under bases transformations and used them to improve ews .",
    "next , we defined a continuous variable ew capable of detecting the negativities of the marginal quasiproability distributions input to an arbitrary bs .",
    "we have proven that negativity of at least one of the @xmath110-parametrized marginal quasiprobabilities for @xmath159 at the input ( output ) of a bs with transitivity @xmath133 implies the entanglement of the output ( input ) state . in particular , we showed that a single photon of sufficient purity can transform _ any _ input state into a bipartite entangled state upon interaction on an arbitrary bs .",
    "we also showed that this entanglement can be imprinted on the marginal output quasiproabilities of a second bs in the form of negativities to certify the entanglement of the input modes .",
    "in other words , our sufficient criterion provides an easy way for the generation and detection of entangled states with arbitrary high number of photons . using general arguments",
    ", we studied the evolution of the entanglement generated and detected by our criterion in a lossy mach - zehnder interferometer and extended the important fact that the entanglement does not diminish as long as both modes are not completely blocked ( lost ) .",
    "last but not least , our results hold true for other bosonic systems such as quantum opto - mechanics and spin ensembles as well .",

    "the overall state will thus be given by @xmath199 where the modes @xmath200 and @xmath201 are the ancillae and @xmath202 .",
    "now , tracing out the ancillae modes gives @xmath203 now , we can apply the partial transposition ( pt ) criterion in which the partially transposed state can be represented in matrix form as @xmath204 where the partial transposition @xmath205 is taken with respect to mode two .",
    "note that for two - qubit states ( @xmath206 quantum systems ) pt criterion is both necessary and sufficient to verify the entanglement .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath207 are given by @xmath208 the eigenvalue @xmath209 takes on negative values for any @xmath210 , since @xmath211 .",
    "this means that for any value of loss below @xmath175 , the lossy output state @xmath212 is npt - entangled and thus distillable .",
