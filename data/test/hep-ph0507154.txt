    "one of the most crucial and difficult tasks of string phenomenologists is now to make , and keep , contact between the high energy theory , and the low energy world .",
    "for that , we need to consider a superstring theory which yields in four dimensions , the standard model gauge group , three generations of quarks , and a consistent mechanism of susy breaking .",
    "our analysis have relies on orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string within the context of supergravity effective theories .",
    "more specifically , we concentrate on those models where the action is dominated by one loop order contributions to soft breaking terms . recently , all one loop order contributions have been calculated @xcite .",
    "the key point of such models is the non universality of supersymmetry breaking term which is a consequence of the beta ",
    "function appearing in the superconformal anomalies .",
    "this non universality gives a specific phenomenology in the gaugino and the scalar sectors , modifying the predictions coming from msugra .",
    "in fact , these string  motivated models show new behavior that interpolates between the phenomenology of unified supergravity models ( msugra ) and models dominated by the superconformal anomalies ( amsb ) .",
    "the constraints arising from accelerator physics , and dark matter aspects have been already studied @xcite . the prospect of direct detection , @xcite and indirect from the galactic center @xcite have been recently published .",
    "it becomes interesting now , to see in which sense experimental limits on supersymmetric particles will be able to bring us informations , or even to rule out some of these models , taking into account the complementarity between accelerator physics ( lepii , future lc ) and astroparticle .",
    "our phenomenological study is based on orbifold compactifications of the weakly  coupled heterotic string , where we distinguish two regimes . in the first one ,",
    "susy breaking is driven by the compactification moduli @xmath0 , whose vacuum expectation values determine the size of the compact manifold . in the second one , it is the dilaton field @xmath1 , whose vacuum expectation value determines the magnitude of the ( unified ) coupling constant @xmath2 at the string scale , that transmits , via its auxiliary fields , susy breaking .",
    "we work in the context of models in which string nonperturbative corrections to the kahler potential act to stabilize the dilaton in the presence of gaugino condensation @xcite .",
    "the origins of breaking terms are diverse .",
    "some coming from the superconformal anomalies are non  universal ( proportional to the beta function of the @xmath3 groups ) some are independent of the gauge group considered ( green  schwarz counterterm , @xmath4 of the condensate ) .",
    "this interplay between universality and non  universality gives a rich new phenomenology , and indicates new trends in the search of supersymmetric particles in accelerator or astroparticle physics .      in the moduli dominated scenario , the supersymmetric susy breaking terms can be written@xcite @xmath5\\eisen f^{t } + \\frac{2}{3}b_{a}{\\overline{m } } \\rbr , \\label{modsoftgaugi}\\\\ a_{ijk}&= & - \\frac{1}{3 } \\gamma_{i}{\\overline{m } } - p \\gamma_{i } \\eisen f^{t } + { \\rm cyclic}(ijk ) , \\\\",
    "m_{i}^{2 } & = & ( 1-p)\\gamma_i \\frac{|m|^2}{9}. \\label{modsoftscal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is the one loop beta  function coefficient of the @xmath7 gauge coupling @xmath8 .",
    "the field @xmath9 is the auxiliary field of the supergravity multiplet related to the gravitino mass by    @xmath10    we clearly see in these formulae the mixing between universal term and non  universal ones .",
    "moreover , scalar mass terms are coming with a loop suppression factor @xmath11 , and the gaugino mass breaking terms have a universal compensation coming from the green  schwarz counterterm ( appearing in order to cancel anomalies ) that can give high value to the chargino or neutralino masses . to sum up",
    ", this regime gives light scalars and relatively heavy gauginos , whose nature depends completely on the value of @xmath12 .      in this region of parameter space",
    ", we can express the soft susy breaking terms as    @xmath13 f^{s } \\rbr \\label{dilatsoftgaugi}\\\\ a_{ijk } & = & -\\frac{k_s}{3}f^s - \\frac{1}{3 } \\gamma_{i}{\\overline{m } } + \\tilde{\\gamma}_{i } f^{s } { \\left\\ { }   \\newcommand{\\rbr}{\\right\\}}\\ln(\\mu_{\\mathrm{pv}}^{2}/\\mu_r^2 ) -p\\ln\\[(t+\\bar{t } ) |\\eta(t)|^4\\ ] \\rbr + ( ijk )    \\\\ m_{i}^{2 } & = & \\frac{|m|^2}{9 }   \\ [ 1 + \\gamma_i -\\(\\sum_{a}\\gamma_{i}^{a } -2\\sum_{jk}\\gamma_{i}^{jk}\\ ) \\ ( \\ln(\\mu_{\\mathrm{pv}}^{2}/\\mu_r^2 ) -p\\ln\\[(t+\\bar{t } ) |\\eta(t)|^4\\ ] \\ ) \\ ] \\nonumber   \\\\   & & + { \\left\\ { }   \\newcommand{\\rbr}{\\right\\}}{\\widetilde{\\gamma}}_{i}\\frac{mf^s}{6}+{\\mathrm{\\ ; h.c .",

    "villars weigths of the regulator fields .",
    "the phenomenology of the dilaton dominated scenario is completly different from the moduli dominated one .",
    "if we look at ( [ dilatsoftscal ] ) and ( [ dilatsoftgaugi ] ) , it is clear that we are in a domain of heavy squarks and sleptons ( of the order of the gravitino scale ) and light gaugino masses , directed by the dilaton auxiliary field @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , the beta  functions @xmath6 are of the order of @xmath19 , which will not be competitive compared to the @xmath20 term of the dilaton in ( [ dilatsoftgaugi ] ) .",
    "in fact , if we look more clearly at ( [ fs ] ) , for not so big values of @xmath15 , we can consider that @xmath21 has a linear evolution as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "increasing @xmath15 means approaching the universal case for the gaugino sector ( and the scalar one , driven by @xmath22 ) .",
    "in the specific context of the class of string models that we have considered , we have seen in @xcite that the prediction regarding dark matter are strikingly different according to the type of supersymmetry breaking considered . in the case of moduli domination , one does not expect any signal in the forthcoming direct or indirect ( neutrino ) detection experiments . on the other hand",
    ", these experiments should not miss the neutralino signal in the case of dilaton domination .",
    "thus , the detection of dark matter or the absence of detection may give key information on the nature of supersymmetry breaking , at least in the context of this given class of models .",
    "we have also studied in @xcite gamma  ray and synchrotron radiation emission from the galactic center in this context . typically , as it is the case for direct detection , models in the dilaton dominated susy breaking scenario lead to a higher annihilation rate than the moduli scenario . concerning the continuum gamma ",
    "ray flux , both scenarios are within the reach of the experimental sensitivities of glast and hess for a nfw halo profile .",
    "for the same profile , the gamma  ray line signal is supressed and beyond the experimental sensitivitiy .",
    "the synchrotron emission is too low to be constrained by experiments even with a more cuspy profile .",
    "obviously , there are connections between these results and the detection of the lsp at colliders .",
    "small direct detection cross sections or small indirect detection fluxes are obviously correlated with small production cross sections at colliders . in any case , it is interesting for collider searches to note the characteristics of the regions that satisfy the criterion of satisfactory relic density . for moduli domination ,",
    "we have identified two regions of interest : one where @xmath23 through the bino and wino content of the lsp ( for sufficiently large value of tan@xmath24 ) , and the other one close to the stau lsp region where @xmath25 . in the case of dilaton domination",
    ", the cosmologically interesting region corresponds to a lsp with a proper higgsino content .",
    "furthermore , the parameter space being closed ( @xmath15 has a maximum value of @xmath26 0.57 ) , this case gives an upper bound on neutralino mass of @xmath27 gev .",
    "we have sum up all these constraints and prospects using the complementarity between accelerator physics and astroparticle in the ( @xmath28 ) plane in fig .",
    "[ figure ] for tan@xmath29 .",
    "we clearly see that all the parameter space can be excluded if no discovery is made in the next generation of collider ( linear collider of 1 tev ) or astroparticle experiments ( indirect detection of neutrino from sun , antares ) .",
    "this methodology can of course be applied in any class of string inspired model , especially the recently developped kklt set - up @xcite .",
    "the author wish to thank all his collaborators for this work .",
    "he also wants to warmly thank p. zerwas for sharing his incredible knowledge and enthousiasm , and the desy theory group for their scientific and financial supports ."
