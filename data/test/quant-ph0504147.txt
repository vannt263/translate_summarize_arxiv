    "interference is recognized as a major mechanism to control quantum dynamics  @xcite .",
    "if a system exhibiting quantum interference is sensitive to the phase of applied driving fields , then the interference itself can often be conveniently controlled .",
    "this is intuitively clear , as the relative phase between the interfering pathways decides whether constructive or destructive interference takes place .",
    "thus it is not surprising that phase - dependent systems have been discussed extensively  @xcite .",
    "the phase - control of quantum interference has also been verified experimentally  @xcite .",
    "one of the first and simplest examples for a phase - sensitive system is a three - level system in @xmath0 configuration , where the upper state decays spontaneously into the two lower states coupled by a classical driving field  @xcite .",
    "the transition dipole moments from the upper state to the two lower states are assumed to be non - orthogonal .",
    "then , due to the driving field , each of the two lower states can be reached via two pathways : either by a direct spontaneous decay , or by a decay into the other state followed by a driving field - induced transition .",
    "the two paths interfere , with a relative phase between the two path amplitudes equal to the driving field phase .",
    "this classical interpretation , however , is unsatisfactory for several reasons .",
    "first , the respective initial and the final states of two interfering pathways are obviously not the same , as one involves an interaction with the driving field , whereas the other does not . thus one could argue that the two paths do not interfere , as they could be distinguished by a measurement .",
    "a typical counter - argument against this is that the photon number distribution of a strong coherent driving field has a large width , such that the two paths can not be distinguished .",
    "this argument , however , can not be verified using a semi - classical description of the system .",
    "second , while it is clear that the two pathways must have either a different initial or a different final state , it is not apparent in the semiclassical description what the exact pathways are . third , the classical description restricts the system to classical driving fields , and thus does not allow to consider non - classical driving fields to further study the system properties . finally , it is not obvious where the phase of the driving field should be considered in a quantized treatment .",
    "for example , in the quantized treatment , both the coupling constants and the initial field state can carry phase information",
    ".    bare - state representation of the considered system .",
    "the multiple lines for each state denote the fock state multiplets induced by the coupling of the atom with a quantized driving field . the upper states @xmath2 decay spontaneously into the two lower state multiplets @xmath3 and @xmath4 . here , @xmath5 is the number of photons in the respective driving field fock modes .",
    "the two lower state multiplets are coupled by the quantized driving field . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are coupling constants for the interaction with the vacuum giving rise to spontaneous emission , @xmath8 is the coupling constant for the driving field.,width=207 ]    thus in this article , we revisit the three - level system in @xmath0 configuration , but treat the driving field as quantized .",
    "this allows to discuss the phase and interference effects on the single photon level .",
    "we derive a set of equations for the two dressed lower states alone , and solve this numerically for different field configurations . for coherent fields , which are closest to classical fields",
    ", we find the same results as in the classical case . by analyzing driving fields consisting of a single fock mode , few adjacent number states , or separated fock states",
    ", it is possible to find the origin of the quantum interference and to identify the interfering pathways .",
    "it turns out that it is not the large total width of the photon number distribution which is crucial for the interference , but rather a fixed phase relation ( coherence ) between adjacent fock modes .",
    "the driving field gives rise to an upper state multiplet , even though it is only coupled to the lower state  @xcite .",
    "then the interference occurs independently in three - level subsystems in @xmath1-configuration , which are formed by two adjacent upper states and a single lower dressed state .",
    "finally , some insight is gained in the role of phase in quantum systems by comparing the quantum treatment with the semiclassical description .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the next section  [ sec - analytic ] , we analytically derive a set of equations for the two dressed ground states alone , which is then solved numerically in section  [ sec - numerics ] for different initial field configurations .",
    "the results of this analysis are discussed and summarized in section  [ sec - discussion ] .",
    "in the following , we consider a three - level system in @xmath0-configuration as shown in fig .  [ fig - system ] .",
    "the upper state @xmath9 decays to the two lower states @xmath10 , @xmath11 with decay rates @xmath12 , @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the two lower states are connected by a coherent field , which in the following we treat as a quantized field . for simplicity , we assume the driving field to be on resonance with the transition frequency @xmath14 between the two lower states . the interaction hamiltonian in the interaction picture may then be written as  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 here , @xmath17 denotes the interaction of the atom with the surrounding vacuum field giving rise to spontaneous emission , and @xmath18 describes the interaction with the quantized driving field .",
    "@xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are atomic transition operators , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are annihilation ( creation ) operators of the driving field , and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are the corresponding operators of the surrounding vacuum mode @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are detunings to atomic transition frequencies @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the energy of state @xmath30 . @xmath31 and @xmath7 are coupling constants . as we are interested in the phase - dependence of the system , these constants are treated as complex entities . in particular , we define @xmath32 note that for simplicity , we treat the transitions between the two lower atomic states as one - photon transitions  @xcite . however , replacing @xmath18 with a corresponding effective hamiltonian containing two - photon transitions proportional to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) does not change the involved physics .",
    "the interference effects in this system crucially depend on the relative orientation of the dipole moments of the transitions @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "if the two dipole moments are orthogonal , then no interference effects are possible .",
    "a simple interpretation for this result is that then the photons emitted spontaneously on the two transitions can be distinguished by their polarizations , such that no pathway interference is possible .",
    "thus in the following , we assume the two dipole moments to be parallel .",
    "note that spontaneously generated coherences between the two lower states which arise if further @xmath14 is smaller than or of the same order as @xmath37 do not play a role in the current system setup .",
    "these coherences , however , become relevant if additional driving fields on transitions @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) couple to them ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    dressed state representation of the system configuration with a quantized driving field .",
    "the two lower bare states @xmath10 , @xmath11 are ac - stark shifted and absorbed into the dressed states due to the driving field .",
    "the numbers at the arrows correspond to the numbers at the peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig - noint].,height=188 ]    to simplify the analysis , we transfer the system to the dressed state representation for the two driven states , which is given by    [ dressedstates ] @xmath40    the dressed - state representation of the system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - system - dress ] for parameters where the ac - stark splitting is larger than the level splitting of the two lower bare states .",
    "the wave function of the system can be written as @xmath41 here , @xmath42 denotes a state with no photons in the surrounding vacuum , @xmath5 photons in the driving field mode and the atom in electronic state @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) . from the schrdinger equation , @xmath45 the equations of motion for the state amplitudes can be evaluated to give @xmath46 as shown in appendix  [ app - derivation ] , in a wigner - weisskopf - like evaluation , and assuming that the atom initially is in the upper state @xmath9 ( @xmath47 ) , one may solve the equation of motion for the upper state amplitudes to give @xmath48 the rate @xmath49 is the total decay rate of the upper state @xmath9 to both lower states .",
    "note that each of the fock number state amplitudes of the driving field decays independently .",
    "the reason is that the spontaneous emission from the upper state is an irreversible process , such that the driving field coupling to the lower states can not influence the decay of the upper states .",
    "as the wigner - weisskopf procedure involves the continuum limit of an infinite quantization volume , in the following , we replace the discrete ground state amplitudes and the detunings by their continuous counterparts : @xmath50 on inserting eq .",

    "[ fig - system - dress ] .",
    "it turns out that the spectrum for a single fock state is identical to the spectrum obtained for a coherent or classical driving field if the interference effects are ignored .",

    "the two initial states , however , have a fixed phase relation with relative phase @xmath75 , which nevertheless allows for interference to take place .",
    "the interfering subsystems are thus independent three - level systems in @xmath1 configuration .",
    "note that independent interference to several final states was also found in other systems  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion can be further verified by noting from fig .",
    "[ fig - decay ] that for each final state , one of the pathways is mediated by the coupling constant @xmath6 , whereas the other path is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "thus the interference effects should also be controllable via the relative phase of these coupling constants just as via the phase @xmath75 .",

    "the interference effects are reduced both if @xmath14 is increased or decreased .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual @xmath1 system with parallel dipole moment , where the interference effects only become smaller if the level spacing is increased .",
    "this upper restriction to @xmath14 warrants that the interfering pathways can not be distinguished by their transition frequencies . in our system , the additional requirement @xmath104 for maximum interference stems from the fact that for total destructive interference , the two amplitudes must have equal weights .",
    "this is the case for @xmath68 .",
    "thus the analogy to spontaneous decay in atomic @xmath1 systems with non - orthogonal transition dipole moments in  @xcite is not complete .",

    "the reason for this is that the decay pathways which do not take part in an interfering @xmath1 subsystem disturb the spectrum . for a narrow distribution with equal weights ,",
    "the relative weight of the disturbing pathways is not negligible as compared to the weight of the interfering pathways such that the quantum spectrum deviates from the classical one .",
    "if the number of adjacent states initially populated grows , the relative weights of the disturbing paths become small , and the spectrum approaches the classical one .",
    "a nice check is possible by considering three adjacent states @xmath109 populated initially as in fig .",
    "[ fig - decay ] , but evaluating the spectrum with amplitudes @xmath110 and @xmath111 only .",
    "the result is a spectrum identical to the classical one up to a normalization factor @xmath112 , as then only the interfering pathways are taken into account , while the contribution of the disturbing final states which are only populated by a single pathway are neglected .    from fig .",
    "[ fig - decay ] and from the definition of the dressed states in eq .",
    "( [ dressedstates ] ) one may also understand why it is not possible to cancel the spontaneous emission completely . on evaluating the transition matrix elements between upper states @xmath2 and the dressed states @xmath113 for spontaneous emissions",
    ", one finds that the relative phase between paths leading to dressed states @xmath114 differs by @xmath115 from the relative phase between paths leading to dressed states @xmath116 .",
    "thus destructive interference is not possible to both dressed state manifolds at the same time , and there is always spontaneous emission .",
    "finally , we discuss the case of distant fock modes initially populated . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig - decay ] , then none of the final states can be reached via more than one pathway , and no interference is possible .",
    "thus it is not a large total width of the initial driving field state , but rather the fixed phase relation between adjacent fock mode states , which accounts for the interference effects .    in summary",
    ", we have discussed the spontaneous - emission spectrum of a three - level system in @xmath0 configuration , which is sensitive to the phase of a quantized electromagnetic field coupling the two lower atomic states .",
    "the quantum treatment together with a specific choice of non - classical initial states for the driving field allows to identify the mechanism leading to interference and the phase dependence .",
    "we found that the quantized driving field creates an upper - state multiplet of fock number states .",
    "the system shows interference signatures if the initial state of the driving field contains adjacent fock number states with a fixed phase relation .",
