    "in 1995 two faculty members , a postdoctoral student , and 3 graduate students at the university of california at davis ( uc davis ) began teaching a series of introductory physics courses@xcite that rapidly became the standard introduction to physics for bioscience ( and many agriculture ) majors here at davis .",
    "these people were strongly influenced by research in education@xcite including research in physics education.@xcite as the references show , these instructors efforts were informed by the constructivist idea that each student builds their own knowledge through discussion and argumentation . toward this end these curriculum developers specific goals were to develop a way to keep the discussions and argumentation at a high intellectual level and to keep the students main focus on concepts rather than calculations , on genuine understanding@xcite rather than rote memorization , and on the few big ideas in physics rather than the very many small details .",
    "essentially all aspects of the class including the physics topics covered in the class , the organization of those topics , the delivery of instruction , and the exam questions and the grading of those questions were changed from the standard introductory physics series that this class supplanted . in the subsequent years many instructors made contributions and this physics series evolved as experience changed ideas of what can be and should be accomplished with a group of students at this stage in their academic careers .",
    "however , the general purpose and the general structure of the course has been consistent throughout its existence .",
    "this paper is a description of this series of introductory courses .",
    "the series of courses that we are discussing are physics 7a , 7b , and 7c at uc davis but we will often refer to these reformed courses generically as our clasp ( collaborative learning through active sense - making in physics ) program .",
    "the paper begins with a discussion of the general structure and pedagogy of the course paying particular attention to how the course is designed to allow peer - peer communication and to keep this communication at the level of making sense of physics and using the ideas , concepts , and models of physics rather than at the level of simple memorization or learning algorithms without understanding .",
    "we then include enough detail of the actual course to make it clearer what the class really looks like to an instructor or a student .",
    "finally , we include a short discussion of some of the things we have discovered or measured in trying to assess the effects of the course . in particular we discuss our students learning of physics , their understanding of physics and science in general , and their abilities in science in general .",
    "one of the most distinct differences between clasp and the series of courses it succeeded is in the order and organization of the physical ideas that we include in the curriculum .",
    "the courses that clasp supplanted were organized in the relatively standard way ( starting with small ideas like particle position and velocity , building to include the ideas of newton and , eventually , building a logical structure including i ) broader ideas like the major conservation laws and ii ) extensions of the basic ideas to more complex phenomena such as wave motion and the force laws of e&m . )",
    "this type of course may not be as useful as we hope to students@xcite who are learning the subject for the first time and who are judging `` what is important to really understand '' by the number of problems that they have to solve using the various ideas and by the overwhelming number of algorithms that seem important . as noted above",
    ", the originators of clasp wanted to keep each student s focus on the main ideas of physics ( i.e. exactly on `` what is important to really understand '' ) and the unity inherent in the structure of physics rather than on the immense number of detailed specific examples and algorithms that are inevitably used to show how these main ideas play out in the world.@xcite toward this end , the three courses in the series are organized around a set of about two dozen models@xcite that physicists use to describe the major features of how the world works . of these models ,",
    "it is probably fair to say that about a half dozen of them are the most important overarching models.@xcite these models , and this organization of ideas , are prominent in all of the work that the students do so we will briefly describe their location in the course .      in an attempt to build on the student",
    "s familiarity with chemistry , the series of courses begins with _ conservation of energy _ ( both internal energies and mechanical energies ) .",
    "this is immediately followed by the _ statistical properties of systems of large numbers of atoms _ and so completes the discussion of _",
    "thermodynamics_. next , conservation of energy ideas are used to analyze _ fluid flow _ and _ electrical charge flow_. after this is a shift to two other conservation laws , _ conservation of momentum _ and _ conservation of angular momentum _ ( this is the introduction to _ newtonian mechanics _ ) . following these discussions in mechanics ,",
    "we introduce _ wave models _ , _ interference _ , and _",
    "optics_. finally , the students discuss _ fields _ ( mainly e&m ) and _ quantum mechanics_.      one important reason for dealing so explicitly with models in clasp is the hope that the students who learn to work with these models end up building a conceptual structure that allow them to make some progress in ( i.e. begin ) understanding almost any physical situation in the real world . to help the students build and use this conceptual structure",
    ", each model comes with a pictorial ( diagrammatic ) or graphical representation that gives them a way to begin working with the model ( i.e. begin understanding a particular physical situation ) before@xcite writing down equations and doing complicated algebra.@xcite the students very readily use these diagrammatic and graphical representations in their discussions@xcite and the representations clearly help them structure the presentations of their ideas to the entire class .",
    "schematic pictures of two of these diagrammatic representations ( one for energy conservation and one for momentum conservation ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "a regular offering of a physics 7 course at uc davis includes a lecture which meets once a week for about 80 minutes and a discussion / laboratory ( dl ) that meets twice a week for about 140 minutes each time . so about 1/5 of the class time is spent in lecture with the rest spent in the dls mostly in intellectually intensive discussions , in small groups ( typically 5 students ) , concerned with either i ) making sense of the models or ii ) using the models to make sense of various important physical situations .",
    "lectures in the clasp courses generally begin the presentation of material but they do not have to be nearly as complete or as self contained as lectures in a standard physics course would be .",
    "for instance , in a clasp lecture , the lecturer may define the appropriate technical words , describe the appropriate physical concepts and models , and ask the students to use them in real - world examples .",
    "however , the lecturer does not need to work out any example problems for the students because the students will be working hard on applying the models in different ( example ) situations during their approximately 5 hours of dl time each week .",
    "many lecturers consider the lecture time to be essentially a `` bonus time '' rather than the time when the students must see all of the material .",
    "this is not only quite different from the usual view of lecture , it also liberates the lecturer to engage the class in whatever activities the lecturer thinks are most useful .",
    "the discussions in dl are what places our clasp course in the category of `` interactive engagement '' classes@xcite and they are as student - centered as we have been able to make them .",
    "the discussions are facilitated by an instructor who helps each group of students figure things out for themselves whenever they get stuck .",
    "the intent is that the pace of these small group discussions is completely controlled by the students and that the discussions are carried out primarily in the student s voice even when an instructor is present .",
    "we provide instructors with notes for each activity , and some of these notes remind the instructor that they are supposed to be a `` guide on the side '' not a `` sage on the stage''.@xcite    [ [ section ] ]    in the discussion / laboratory ( dl ) the students work in small groups on activities aimed at helping each student build their own personal understanding of the constructs of any particular model and the way in which these constructs are used within the model .",
    "the activities are intended to help our students become fully literate in a particular model so the activities generally ask the students to discuss specific physical situations in their own words , discuss them using the technical words and concepts of the appropriate model , diagram the situation using one of the representations discussed above , and , sometimes , translate these discussions into the mathematical language of the model .",
    "we leave much of the mathematics and almost all of the arithmetic for the students to do at home .",
    "attendance in our dls is required so the dl activities require that _ each _ student spends time making sense of the ideas ( hence , clasp ) .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the pace of the discussions is determined approximately by the majority of the students in the class .",
    "after a reasonable number of the small groups ( half of them or more ) have come to their conclusions about the activities that we asked them to work on , the instructor stops the small group discussions and leads a whole class discussion on the activity .",
    "ideally , this whole class discussion is also carried out in the voice of the students ( i.e. student - student discussions of the ideas ) .",
    "we have many goals in our introduction of a discussion with the whole class at the end of an activity .",
    "the first goal will be clear to any teacher .",
    "the whole class discussion aims to leave each student , at a minimum , with a basic understanding of what ideas needed to be used in the activity , how they needed to be used , where these ideas fit into the field of physics , and how the activities relate to other activities that they have done .",
    "however , beyond this learning of physics concepts , we hope that our class gives our students a ( somewhat ) realistic view@xcite of how science proceeds and we see no reason that this can not be done in concert with the first goal .",
    "for instance , a whole class discussion may result in some groups advocating for one way of thinking about things and other groups advocating for another way ( this is actually not uncommon when 5 or 6 groups work on their activities relatively independently ) and then the discussion can bring out differing assumptions , differing viewpoints , and ( of course ) genuine conceptual misunderstandings .",
    "the whole class discussion also gives the students a chance to practice developing proper scientific discussions.@xcite this practice at generating proper scientific arguments should not only help build confidence that they can do well on our exams but also confidence in performing well in their other classes .",
    "we will discuss the details of assessments and grading in a separate paper but , briefly , the culture in the clasp series at ucdavis is that there are many short quizzes ( something like a 20 minute quiz every week or a 30 minute quiz every two weeks ) and a final exam .",
    "there are two main reasons for very frequent quizzes .",
    "the first is that the course emphasizes understanding of physical ideas and their application so we want to give the students a way to monitor their understanding of each idea or set of ideas.@xcite the second is so that students have many chances to learn how to produce a scientifically correct argument and a complete discussion of a problem .",
    "finally , there is also a culture regarding the types of exam questions in the clasp series at ucdavis that is followed by many of the instructors ( perhaps 18 - 20 of the 25 - 30 instructors each year ) .",
    "this culture : i ) values exam questions and problems that are significantly different from those that the students have already seen and , also , are not amenable to algorithmic solution and ii ) prizes the quality of a written scientific discussion given by a student above the algebraic correctness of a mathematical answer .",
    "at uc davis over 1700 students each year complete the physics 7a , 7b , 7c series .",
    "most of these students are in bioscience / agriculture majors where this physics series ( or its equivalent ) is a major requirement .",
    "we offer about 50 dl sections each term divided into about 10 sections for each of five physics 7 ( a , or b , or c ) classes .",
    "thus , each dl section has about 30 students who typically work in about six groups of five students each .",
    "each of these five classes is taught by two co - instructors along with four or five graduate teaching assistants ( tas ) so that the entire series has 10 instructors and 20 - 25 tas associated with it each term .",
    "usually 30 - 50% of the instructors are regular faculty and the rest are either temporary lecturers or advanced graduate students who are known to be excellent clasp tas and would like to gain broader teaching experience .",
    "the two co - instructors divide up the teaching times and responsibilities in any way they decide to .",
    "the most common way is for one instructor to give the two identical 80 minute lectures each week ( approximately half of the 300 + students in each lecture ) and to handle the major administrative duties of the class and for the other instructor to teach the first discussion / lab section , run two ta meetings each week , and deal with the administrative issues associated with the discussion / lab .",
    "because no instructor teaches alone , it turns out that this course is a good way to introduce new instructors to teaching clasp ( in particular , it provides the perfect course for an advanced graduate student to practice lecturing under the mentorship of an experienced faculty member teaching the course with them ) .",
    "both instructors are responsible for the final grades so both work on writing and grading the exams .",
    "the role of the dl instructor ( either a faculty member or a graduate student ) is largely to facilitate the discussions that students have about their assigned activities and/or homework problems and to keep the students on task .",
    "the actual dl activities are usually packaged with course notes and purchased by the students at the beginning of the quarter but , sometimes , activities are given out to the students during the quarter .",
    "the dls are where the students do much of their thinking and get much of their practice with the material so they are the most important part of the course .",
    "graduate tas lead over 90% of these dl sections and we have found that new graduate tas must rapidly learn about both teaching and learning .",
    "for this reason , we have a significant professional development program focused on our new graduate students teaching this course for their first time . for new graduate tas ,",
    "this includes :    \\i ) a mandatory 3-day introduction to teaching in clasp which , besides dealing with nuts and bolts of the job , also puts the new tas in the roles of students working on clasp activities , followed by putting the tas in the roles of getting ready to teach dl , followed by putting the new tas in the roles of teachers ( with reflections / comments on teaching and learning after each ta is finished ) .",
    "these activities are interspersed with more general discussions of teaching and learning , which are taught in the clasp ( group discussion ) style .",
    "\\ii ) a mandatory 1-hour per week ta training course during the first term that the new graduate student is enrolled at uc davis and begins teaching a dl .",
    "this class is generally aimed at the theory and practice of teaching an interactive engagement type of class.@xcite among other things , in this class the new tas visit dls of senior tas and comment on what they have seen , discuss and practice grading , discuss teaching and learning , discuss the use of models in science , work on improving their whole class discussions as well as their small group discussions , and monitor one meeting of one of their fellow new graduate student s class ( using a computer program@xcite to quantify how their fellow ta spends their time in class ) .",
    "\\iii ) we also offer ( non - mandatory ) ta professional development classes after the fall term .",
    "these are generally aimed at studying and improving each tas teaching skills and/or the clasp activities .",
    "one feature of our clasp course is that it introduces physics faculty to interactive engagement classes .",
    "unfortunately , we do nt have a measure of how much our faculty has been changed by the clasp courses.@xcite however , in 2002 , five faculty who had taught in physics 7 but who had not been involved in its development were asked for some of their thoughts about the course .",
    "they were very happy with all the interactive engagement aspects of the course and all of them ( except one who has retired ) continue to teach it .",
    "the main negative comments were about course materials issues that no longer apply so we will skip them and just present these instructors analyses of the some of the successes of the course ( as well as the prompts which led to the comments ) .    in answer to the prompt : ` what were your expectations coming into physics 7 ? ' one faculty member : _ i came into physics 7 with a very negative attitude .",
    "i  had taught physics 5 _ ( the traditional intro - physics for bioscience course at ucd ) _ three times through .",
    "i had a student  who would come in every day and tell me what a fiasco this whole physics 7 was  .",
    "rather than going to a faculty meeting and in complete ignorance try to stop this disaster , i figured the only honest thing to do was to try to teach it myself so that i could then draw my own conclusions .",
    "when i did that i had sort of the complete opposite experience than _ [ my student ] _ had .",
    "i really enjoyed it .",
    "i really felt that it was a much more dynamic learning environment  .",
    "getting the students up presenting their responses to the class really forced them to think their ideas out very clearly .",
    "_    in answer to the prompt : ` what did you find most surprising about teaching physics 7 ? ' a different faculty member : _ how much fun it was .",
    "it s a riot !",
    "i mean you really get to meet  six hours  that s more time than most people spend with their kids at this age , you know , or younger .",
    "and you get to know them all . and that s kind of fun",
    " it s the methodology of the activities .",
    "how you work in little groups , and how the groups present their stuff to the larger group .",
    "it s not the activity per se , but how we go about investigating it and sharing it ( i hate that word )  telling other people it . _    in a discussion following the prompt ` what do you think of the attitudes that students have in physics 7 ? ' a third faculty member : _ the attitude may be unchanged , but because it forces them to talk and participate  at least it draws out something in them that they do nt get drawn out in a lecture class .",
    "i was actually pleasantly surprised at what a large fraction would actually talk , would ask questions , puzzle on things  .",
    "i think that s why this is a successful class , because it forces some mental activity on the students part that is always lacking if they are sitting taking notes in lecture . _",
    "in this section we will discuss some data that we have examined over the years and that help us judge the success of this course .",
    "first , we directly compare students who took the physics 7 series with those who took our previous physics series ( physics 5 ) .",
    "then we discuss scores on concept inventories .",
    "finally , we discuss our students more general understandings of what science ( specifically , physics ) is .",
    "we expect the physics 7 series to help prepare students for later work . in checking this",
    "we have examined two main things , student s work in later courses and students mcat scores .      in the few years after the introduction of this clasp course we had a chance to compare the students taking the physics 7 ( clasp ) series with those who took the previous ucd intro - physics series for bioscience students ( physics 5 ) . as a proxy for the upper division major gpa",
    "we calculate a student s gpa during the 7 quarters ( just over two years ) that preceded their graduation and use those to compare different groups of students .",
    "we only include students who had completed at least 65 quarter units ( about 1.5 years of a normal class load ) and we did not include any students who started their intro - physics series less than 5 quarters before their graduation .",
    "finally , we remove any intro - physics grade points and units that they received in the 7 quarters before graduation .",
    "there are two kinds of comparisons that we have done , i ) a direct comparison between physics 5 students and physics 7 students who had overlapping graduation years and ii )",
    "a comparison between the students who took their intro - physics at ucd in either physics 5 or physics 7 and those students who did not take either of those and so must have taken another intro - physics course ( most students in this group have transferred into a biosci major after two years at a community college ) .",
    "we can directly compare the gpas for the graduating classes of 1998 and 1999 , which are the only years with significant overlap between physics 5 and physics 7 students .",
    "we find mean gpas of@xcite 3.068 @xmath0 0.018 for the 755 students who took physics 5 ( and met the criteria discussed above ) and 3.127 @xmath0 0.018 for the 666 students who took physics 7 .",
    "we conclude that the physics 7 students were ( statistically ) significantly better in their major courses in this direct comparison.@xcite this direct comparison might be criticized because these students have made a decision ( either directly or indirectly ) as to which physics series to take .",
    "this is the reason for our second comparison .    in the second comparison",
    "we calculate the same ( essentially upper - division ) graduating gpas for four groups of students in two sets of years , 1993 - 1997 ( biosci students could only take physics 5 ) and 1999 - 2003 ( only physics 7 was available ) .",
    "the groups of students are : a ) students who took our intro - physics series for biosci majors ( either physics 5 or 7 depending on the graduation years we choose ) because this course was a requirement for their biosci major , ii ) students who graduated with these biosci majors requiring intro - physics but who did not take our intro course ( almost all of these took intro - physics at another college and almost all are transfer students ) , iii ) students who completed non - bioscience majors at ucd and were admitted as freshmen,@xcite and iv ) students who completed non - bioscience majors at ucd and transferred to ucd after completing their lower division work at another college.@xcite    the differences between the gpas of these third and fourth groups of students will be used as a measure of the academic strength of our transfer students compared to the students admitted as freshmen .",
    "for each of these sets of years the non - biosci students admitted as freshmen had an average ( graduating ) gpa that was 0.02 @xmath0 0.01 higher than the average for the non - biosci transfer students .",
    "in other words , in each of these sets of years , transfer students fared about as well as the 4-year students at ucd and the difference did not change from one set of years to the other .",
    "this near equivalence between those students admitted to uc davis as freshmen and those admitted as transfer students allows us to compare the gpas of the bio - sci students graduating in the different sets of years .",
    "for instance , bio - sci students who took physics 5 and who graduated in the years 1993 - 1997 had an average gpa that was 0.057 @xmath0 0.015 larger than those students graduating with the same majors but without having taken our intro - physics courses",
    ". we compare this with bio - sci students who took physics 7 , who graduated in the years 1999 - 2003 , and who had an average gpa 0.115 @xmath0 0.014 higher than those students graduating with the same majors in those same years but without having taken our intro - physics courses .",
    "this much larger gpa gap is another piece of information suggesting that students taking physics 7 were better prepared for their major classes than students who took physics 5 . as an aside",
    ", we note that about 25% of this increase came from an increased average gpa of males and about 75% of it came from the increased gpas of females .",
    "another indication of a positive effect due to physics 7 came from an analysis of uc davis students performance on the medical college admissions test ( mcat ) .",
    "we used about five years of data centered on the point at which we stopped teaching physics 5 and began teaching physics 7 .",
    "we compared our students performance ( n = 386 for students who took physics 5 and n = 347 for students who took physics 7 ) on both the physical science and biological portions of the mcat . for the biological science part of the test the scores ranged from 3 - 15 with an average of 9.71 @xmath0 0.10 whether the students took physics 5 or physics 7 .",
    "the physical science part of the test had a similar range of scores and an average of 9.26 @xmath0 0.10 for the students who took physics 5 and 9.42 @xmath0 0.11 for the students who took physics 7 .",
    "this gap of 0.16 @xmath0 0.15 suggests that the physics 7 students were better prepared for the mcat . for the mcat scores , almost all of the increase in performance came from female students whose mean physical science mcat scores were larger by 0.27 @xmath0 0.2 for the students taking physics 7 ( with male students having the same mean score whether they took physics 5 or 7 ) .      the force concept inventory ( pre - test at beginning of 7a and post - test at the end of 7b ) was given to four different groups of students ( total of 898 students ) in 1999 - 2001 resulting in an average pretest score of 31% correct and an average normalized gain of 0.39 @xmath0 0.01 .",
    "it is probably not surprising that this is well above the range associated by hake@xcite with traditional courses and in the middle of the range of `` interactive engagement '' courses .      over the past two decades",
    ", research@xcite has shown that a majority of students leave introductory physics classrooms not only confused about the conceptual content of physics , but also about nature of scientific knowledge .",
    "these ideas are epistemological in nature and the implicit epistemological message sent in many traditional classrooms is apparently not what we want@xcite our students to learn . indirectly , the students appear to be encouraged toward approaches to learning such as rote memorization of many specific algorithms ( rather than learning to use broad general principles ) and dissuaded from reconciling their everyday experiences with the content presented in the course to form a coherent worldview .",
    "several epistemological surveys have been developed@xcite to categorize these beliefs . in general , these surveys consist of a set of statements , such as `` knowledge in physics consists of many pieces of information , each of which applies primarily to a specific situation . '' , with which the student is asked to agree or disagree .",
    "student responses are coded as favorable ( matching what an expert would say ) , as unfavorable , or as neutral .",
    "the surveys are given twice , once at the beginning of instruction and once at the end and movement in student responses are classified as towards or away from expert - like beliefs ( gains or losses ) .",
    "results from these sorts of surveys have been collected from many large lecture classes , across a variety of educational institutions , and from both ` reformed ' and traditional introductory physics classes .",
    "results are fairly consistent . in general , unless the class has focused explicitly on addressing epistemologies , after one semester of physics instruction , student populations tend to move away from the experts in their opinions ( even for most `` reformed '' classes).@xcite    in the fall quarter of 2008 we administered the mpex - ii ( maryland physics expectations survey)@xcite to two separate lecture sections ( for a total of about 600 students ) of physics 7a .",
    "the results showed that the student epistemologies in this set of classes were statistically unchanged over the course of the quarter : favorable fraction of responses changed from 0.46 @xmath0 0.01 to 0.47 @xmath0 0.01 and the unfavorable fraction changed from 0.27 @xmath0 0.01 to 0.28 @xmath0 0.01 .",
    "thus , unlike most standard classes and even many reformed physics classes whose students seem to end the course with less expert epistemologies , this clasp class seems to leave the students epistemological ideas unchanged on average .",
    "though a radical departure from traditional instruction , the series of introductory physics courses discussed in this paper has been fully institutionalized .",
    "it has outlasted the people who originally developed it , it is positively received by faculty , and it provides a good training arena both for new instructors and for new graduate tas .",
    "it is also positively received by our administration , partly because we use no more resources than other introductory courses even though our exams ask the students to discuss their ideas in writing . over 1700 students",
    "take the course each year .",
    "these students leave the series of courses better prepared for their later studies , with better conceptual physics knowledge , and with more expert epistemologies than they would have left our previous introductory series . for all of these reasons ,",
    "we consider our clasp series to be a successful addition to our curriculum .",
    "the clasp series of courses is a work in progress but most of the recent work has been not on how to change the activities to improve learning but , instead , on how to adjust the amounts of time spent on the various models of physics .",
    "we have been focused on the types of physics that our bioscience students will have to understand in their later courses ( the ideal introductory physics course for these students should , perhaps , be an introductory biophysics course ) and we are currently using some of the recent reports on undergraduate education for bio - science@xcite and premed@xcite students in order to help us with this thinking . because our activities ( rather than a textbook ) drive the course we can readily change the course and rapidly adjust the weights given to the various parts of the course according to the results that we get .    finally , as the activity development efforts wind down ,",
    "our physics education group is freed to use the clasp series as a learning laboratory to investigate fundamental issues of teaching and learning . in other words , we are free to make small modifications in activities , exams , lectures , dl culture , etc . and study the results of those changes or to spend more of our time on ta training and other activities that are likely associated with learning .    at this point ,",
    "the clasp series is published by hayden mcneil as `` college physics : a models approach . ''",
    "anyone interested in learning more about or obtaining some clasp materials may contact david webb ( webb@physics.ucdavis.edu ) or wendell potter ( potter@physics.ucdavis.edu ) .",
