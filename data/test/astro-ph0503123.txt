    "a great encouraging development in modern cosmology is the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe through observations of distant type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) results from balloon and ground experiments @xcite and recent wmap @xcite observation confirmed the result from sne ia and favored a spatially flat universe .",
    "it is well known that all known types of matter with positive pressure generate attractive forces and decelerate the expansion of the universe .",
    "the discovery from sne ia and cmb indicate the existence of a new component with negative pressure , which is now generally called dark energy .",
    "the simplest one of dark energy is a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "an explanation of the cosmological constant is the vacuum energy , however , it is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the naive expectation from quantum field theory . bothering physicists",
    "much , other types of dark energy are proposed , such as quintessence @xcite , which is described in terms of a cosmic scalar field @xmath0 ; or other modified cosmological models are discussed , such as the cardassian expansion model which investigates the acceleration of the universe by a modification to the friedmann equations @xcite , the brane world model which explain the acceleration through the fact that general relativity is formulated in 5 dimensions instead of the usual 4 @xcite and so on .",
    "all of these dark energy cosmological models are based on the big bang cosmology . a model with adiabatic matter creation",
    "was proposed firstly in order to interpret the cosmological entropy and solve the big - bang singularity problem @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to modify the usual energy conservation law in open system in the framework of cosmology , which adds a balance equation for the number density of the created particles to the dynamic equations of the universe .",
    "nevertheless , after the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe , this model was reconsidered to explain it and got some unexpected results .",
    "the matter creation pressure @xmath1 , which is negative as pointed out several decades ago by zeldovich @xcite , might play the role of a dark energy component and lead to the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "lima & alcaniz tested the model without cosmological constant through the lookback time - redshift relation , luminosity distance - redshift relation , angular size - redshift relation and the galaxy number counts - redshift relation @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this model was consistent with the observational accelerating expansion of the universe , and could also alleviate the conflict between the age of the universe and the age of the oldest globular clusters .",
    "zimdahl et al .",
    "employed the sne ia data to test the matter creation scenario and also got the result of accelerating expansion @xcite .",
    "freaza et al .",
    ", however , based on the observational sne ia data and the simulated supernova acceleration probe ( snap ) data , showed the matter creation mechanism was not favored to explain the cosmic acceleration @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use recently 186 sne ia sample @xcite , combined with the observational @xmath2 data from the differential age measurements of galaxies @xcite , the cmb and bao data @xcite , to test the cosmological model with matter creation and make constraints of the parameters . as a comparison , the model with both matter creation and cosmological constant",
