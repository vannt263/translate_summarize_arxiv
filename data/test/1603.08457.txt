    "the benchmark of kpz class is the lateral growth , second term in eq .",
    ", that leads to an excess velocity such that the interface envelop moves faster ( or slower if @xmath7 ) than the rate at which particles are added in the system .",

    "except for the very specific case where @xmath26  @xcite , the shift vanishes as @xmath27  @xcite . despite of the absence of exact results in higher dimensions ,",
    "numerical results show that the kpz ansatz remains valid up to @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "discrete growth models are valuable theoretical tools for the realization of universality classes in surface growth phenomena  @xcite since they permit to flexibly implement specific physical mechanisms .",
    "the ballistic deposition ( bd ) model is a paradigmatic interface growth process initially designed to investigate formation of sediments by the aggregation of small particles from a colloid dispersion @xcite . in the bd model ,",
    "particles move ballistically and normally towards the substrate and are irreversibly attached at the first contact with the deposit , producing , therefore , lateral growth that is a central characteristic of the kpz universality class @xcite .",
    "however , the surface evolution exhibits strong corrections in the scaling traditionally attributed to an intrinsic width  @xcite that hampers the direct observation of the kpz critical exponents in this model .",
    "continuous ( coarse - grained ) limits of the db model in @xmath29 yield the kpz equation to leading order but inconsistencies were found in higher dimensions  @xcite . preceded by studies lying on finite - time and",
    "-size corrections  @xcite and intrinsic width  @xcite , a direct observation of kpz universality class for the bd model in @xmath29 was obtained recently by means of thoroughgoing simulations of very large systems and very long growth times  @xcite .",
    "recently , a connection between the bd model and the kpz class in 2 + 1 dimensions was possible by unveiling the nature of the intrinsic width of the model  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the leading contribution to the intrinsic width comes from the short wavelength fluctuations in the height increments @xmath30 along the deposition events .",
    "besides , it was shown that these effects can be suppressed using a coarse - grained interface built from the original one  @xcite ; see sec .",
    "[ model_methods ] .",
    "an important theoretical problem is the upper critical dimension @xmath31 above which fluctuations become negligible .",

    "the paper is organized as follow . in the next section",
    "the model details and the approach used are presented . in section [ results ] , the results are presented and discussed .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the ballistic deposition growth model is implemented in @xmath39 hypercubic lattices of size @xmath40 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the particles are deposited one at a time at a randomly chosen position of a @xmath41-dimensional substrate .",
    "each particle is released perpendicularly to the substrate and becomes permanently stuck at the first contact with either the deposit or substrate  @xcite .",
    "the original interface is defined as the highest position of a particle at each site of the substrate .",
    "a time unity corresponds to the aggregation of @xmath42 particles to the deposit .",
    "the simulations were carried out on substrates of sizes up to @xmath43 with averages over up to @xmath44 independent samples in @xmath1 . for @xmath45 , we consider systems of size up to @xmath46 and up to @xmath47 samples .",
    "the smaller the size the larger the number of samples .",
    "we also investigate surfaces using the prescription of ref .",
    "the procedure consists in dividing the original surface in bins of lateral size @xmath48 , the binning parameter , and using only the site of highest height inside each bin to build a coarse - grained interface used to compute statistics .",
    "the net effect is that the binned interface is smoother than the original one , the latter characterized by many narrow and deep valleys . in @xmath0 , it was shown that the intrinsic width of the coarse - grained surfaces is strongly reduced and , consequently , the strong corrections to the scaling fall off  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the binning does not change the non - universal constants @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "the non - universal constants in the kpz equation , eq .  , and in its ansatz , eq .  , can be obtained using the approach hereafter called krug - meakin ( km ) method  @xcite that is described as follows . from eq .  , the asymptotic velocity is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "so , plotting @xmath51 against @xmath52 renders a straight line for long times with intercept providing @xmath23 and the angular coefficient @xmath53 .",
    "the latter plays an important role to determine the cumulant ratio @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the notation for @xmath56th order cumulant of @xmath57 ; see subsection  [ sec : hds ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 is obtained by the deposition on tilted large substrates with an overall slope @xmath59 , for which a simple dependence between asymptotic velocity and slope @xmath60 is expected for the kpz equation  @xcite .",
    "we can use the relation  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath14 is the roughness exponent of the kpz class , to determine the amplitude of the fluctuations .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 is obtained from the asymptotic velocity @xmath62 of finite systems of size @xmath40  @xcite using the relation @xmath63    the km analysis requires a prior accurate knowledge of the both growth and roughness exponents . in @xmath1",

    ", we adopt the recent estimate @xmath65 determined by kim and kim  @xcite using a rsos model with an optimal height restriction parameter that improves the corrections to the scaling .",
    "the determination of @xmath24 is extremely sensitive to the value of the roughness exponent since it is used twice in the analysis via eqs .   and .",
    "@xcite , it was used the exponents of dor _",

    ", we revisit the data of ref .",
    "@xcite using a more recent estimate of pagnani and parisi  @xcite given by @xmath70 that was obtained doing a thorough finite size analysis and we find a different value @xmath71 that leads to @xmath72 and @xmath73 which are , in absolute values , 14% and 30% , respectively , above the estimates of ref .",

    "ballistic deposition growth models are characterized by a prominent lateral growth and therefore are considered standards of kpz growth  @xcite . however , strong finite - time and -size corrections make a direct realization of the kpz exponents in higher dimensions extremely hard and , in practice , unaccessible with our current computer resources . however , eliciting the origin of the leading contributions to the corrections as being due to the fluctuations of height increments along the deposition of particles , it was possible to do a connection between ballistic deposition and kpz universality class in @xmath0 dimensions  @xcite . moreover , using the coarse - grained surface where only the highest points inside small bins of size @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the surface correlation length , it was possible to obtain the kpz exponents as well as the universal underlying stochastic fluctuations of the kpz class in @xmath0  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
