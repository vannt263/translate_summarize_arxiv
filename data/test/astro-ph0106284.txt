    "planetary systems are thought to form out of circumstellar disks that are the remnants of star formation ( shu , adams , & lizano 1987 )",
    ". observations of young pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars show that many of them are surrounded by optically - thick disks of solar system dimensions with masses comparable to or greater than the `` minimum - mass solar nebula '' of 0.01 @xmath1 ( see beckwith 1999 for a review ) .",
    "infrared emission in excess of stellar photospheric fluxes provides the most readily measurable signature of such disks .",
    "excesses at @xmath2 10 @xmath3 m are found in @xmath45090% of the low - mass stars in star - forming regions ( strom et al .",
    "1993 ; lada et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that circumstellar disks evolve from optically thick to optically thin structures in about 10 myr ( strom et al .",
    "that transition may mark the assembly of grains into planetesimals , or clearing of the disk by planets .",
    "indeed , low - mass debris disks have now been imaged around several main - sequence stars with ages ranging from 10 myr to 500 myr ( e.g. , jayawardhana et al .",
    "1998 ; holland et al . 1998",
    "; greaves et al . 1998 ) . since age estimates for early - type isolated main sequence stars are highly uncertain , however , the timescale for disk evolution and planet formation is poorly constrained , and may depend critically on the presence or absence of a close binary companion .",
    "the nearby young stellar groups provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of circumstellar disks into planetary systems . because of their proximity",
    ", these groups are ideally suited for sensitive disk searches at near- and mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , their age range of 1 - 50 myrs provides a strong constraint on disk evolution timescales and fills a significant gap in the age sequence between @xmath41-myr - old t tauri stars in molecular clouds like taurus - auriga and chamaeleon and the @xmath450-myr - old open clusters such as ic 2602 and ic 2391 ( jayawardhana 2000 ) .",
    "the tw hydrae association ( twa ) consists of @xmath422 co - moving stellar systems ( webb 2001 and references therein ) with estimated ages of @xmath410 myr at a distance of 4767 pc and dispersed over some 20 degrees on the sky .",
    "the members are mostly late - type stars , typically k and m spectral types , and include several binary systems as well as one remarkable quadruple system ( hd 98800 ) .",
    "there is only one early - type star ( hr 4796a ) .    over the past three years",
    ", we have obtained mid - infrared observations of tw hya stars using the oscir instrument on the keck ii and ctio 4-meter telescopes .",
    "we found that many of the twa stars have little or no disk emission at 10 @xmath3 m . even among the five stellar systems with 10@xmath3 m excesses ,",
    "most show some evidence of inner disk evolution .",
    "we imaged a spatially - resolved dust disk around the young a star hr 4796a ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "1998 ; telesco et al .",
    "2000 ; fig .",
    "the surface brightness distribution of the disk is consistent with the presence of an inner disk hole of @xmath450 au radius , as was first suggested by jura et al .",
    "( 1993 ) based on the infrared spectrum .",
    "the seds of hd 98800 and hen 3 - 600a also suggest possible inner disk holes ( jayawardhana et al . 1999a ; 1999b ) .",
    "the excess we detected for cd -33@xmath57795 is modest , and could well be due to a faint companion .",
    "only tw hya appears to harbor an optically - thick , actively accreting disk of the kind observed in @xmath41-myr - old classical t tauri stars ; it is the only one with a large h@xmath6 equivalent width ( -220  ) .",
    "recent polarimetric images using the adaptive optics system on gemini north confirm a nearly face - on disk around tw hya ( d. potter , private communication ) , previously detected in scattered light by wfpc2 ( krist et al .",
    "2000 ) and nicmos ( weinberger et al . 1999 ) on hst and in millimeter emission by the vla ( wilner 2001 ) .",
    "however , even in tw hya , there is evidence for dust settling in the inner disk ( dalessio 2001 ) and lower accretion rates ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2001 ) compared to classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) in taurus .",
    "if most twa stars are @xmath710 myr old , the above results suggest that their inner disks have already depleted either through coagulation of dust or accretion on to the central star .",
    "the fact that only one ( tw hya ) out of 16 systems we observed shows classical t tauri characteristics ( compared to @xmath45090% of @xmath41-myr - old stars in star - forming regions ) argues for rapid evolution of inner disks in pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "however , it is unlikely that there is a universal evolutionary timescale for protoplanetary disks , especially when the influence of companion stars is taken into account .",
    "for example , we have detected thermal emission from a dusty disk around the primary , but not the secondary , in the hen 3 - 600 binary system ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "comparison with the median spectral energy distribution of classical t tauri stars suggests that the disk around hen 3 - 600a may be truncated by the secondary .",
    "sitko et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that the 10@xmath3 m silicate emission feature in tw hya is similar to that of other ctts whereas it is weaker in hd 988000 and almost non - detectable in hr 4796a .",
    "@xmath0 cha is a compact cluster of about a dozen stars at @xmath497 pc , far from any obvious molecular material ( mamajek , lawson & feigelson 1999 ) . among the 12 previously known members of the @xmath0 cha cluster ,",
    "only 2 have h@xmath6 equivalent widths larger than 10   , suggestive of disk accretion",
    ". preliminary results of our february 2001 mid - infrared observations using the timmi2 instrument on the eso 3.6-meter telescope confirm that none of these 12 stars have large excesses consistent with optically - thick disks .",
    "however , lawson ( 2001 ) reports the identification of a new ctts assciated with the cluster , and another member ( recx 11 ) is listed in the iras faint source catalog as showing a far - infrared excess .",
    "other @xmath0 cha stars may have optically thin disks with central cavities , as is the case in several twa stars , but our analysis is not yet complete .",
    "based on _ rosat _ detections and ground - based follow - up optical spectroscopy , hearty et al .",
    "( 2000 ) identified 8 late - type young stars in the high - latitude cloud mbm12 as well as two main - sequence stars in the same line - of - sight which may or may not be related . while there is some uncertainty in the distance to mbm 12 ( luhman 2001 ) , it is likely to be a younger group than tw hya and @xmath0 cha , perhaps only 1 - 3 myr in age .",
    "recently , we have conducted the first investigation of protoplanetary disks in the mbm 12 group , using mid - infrared imaging with keck and ukirt and optical spectroscopy with the kitt peak 4-meter telescope ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "the ( @xmath8 ) and ( @xmath9 ) colors we derived unambiguosly show significant mid - infrared excess from six mbm 12 stars lkh@xmath6 262 , lkh@xmath6 263 , lkh@xmath6 264 , e02553 + 2018 , rxj0258.3 + 1947 and s18 .",
    "in all six cases , the colors are consistent with thermal emission from optically - thick inner disks .",
    "the other two pms stars rxj0255.4 + 2005 and rxj0306.5 + 1921 do not show a measurable mid - infrared excess within the photometric errors , allowing us to rule out such disks .",
    "hd 17332 and rxj0255.3 + 1915 , the two main - sequence stars in the line - of - sight to mbm 12 , also lack evidence of warm circumstellar material .",
    "four of the objects lkh@xmath6 262 , lkh@xmath6 263 , lkh@xmath6 264 and e02553 + 2018 show two components in the h@xmath6 line , and are probably close binaries ( fig .",
    "an h@xmath6 equivalent width greater than 10    is generally considered to be the accretion signature of a classical t tauri star with a circumstellar disk ( herbig & bell 1988 ) .",
    "a smaller equivalent width signifies chromospheric activity , but no accretion .",
    "therefore , mid - infrared excess we measure should be correlated with large h@xmath6 line widths .",
    "indeed , this generally holds true for mbm 12 stars with one notable exception : e02553 + 2018 has a large mid - infrared excess but weak h@xmath6 line emission .",
    "we tentatively suggest that e02553 + 2018 is a candidate for harboring circumbinary dust .",
    "the disk fraction we find in mbm 12 75% falls in the middle of the range reported for other star - forming regions like taurus and trapezium , but is significantly higher than in twa and @xmath0 cha .",
    "preliminary results of recent 3 mm ovro observations of mbm 12 stars suggest that their disk masses fall in the low - mass tail of the taurus ctts distribution ( hogerheijde et al .",
