    "radio emission is an observational property of @xmath0% of x - ray binaries ( see e.g. hjellming & han 1995 ) .",
    "it is anticorrelated with the property of x - ray pulsations ( fender et al .",
    "1997 ) and displays the nonthermal spectra and high ( t@xmath1 k ) brightness temperatures characteristic of synchrotron emission .",
    "radio jets from x - ray binaries were first discovered in the late 1970s from ss 433 ( spencer 1979 ) in which the ejecta were subsequently observed to have an ejection velocity of 0.26 c ( hjellming & johnston 1981 ) . over the ensuing @xmath0 years radio - jets were discovered from perhaps six further x - ray binary sources , in none of which however accurate proper motions of individual ejecta , or plasmons , could be measured ( see e.g. fender , bell burnell & waltman 1997 for a review of observational properties ) .",
    "in the past three years however , apparent superluminal plasmon velocities , corresponding to true relativistic bulk motions at @xmath2c have been observed from two transient x - ray binaries , grs 1915 + 105 ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ) and gro j1655 - 40 ( tingay et al . 1995 ) .",
    "gx 339 - 4 is an unusual x - ray binary which exhibits distinct and varied x - ray states , but is in all states persistently and clearly observable with x - ray telescopes , unlike the transient radio - jet sources grs 1915 + 105 and gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "the characteristics of the x - ray emission , notably a hard tail , rapid variability and a similarity to cyg x-1 , have lead to classification of the source as a strong black hole candidate ( e.g. makishima et al .",
    "1986 ; miyamoto et al .",
    "1992 ; miyamoto et al . 1993",
    "; nowak 1995 ) . optical studies ( callanan et al . 1992 ) reveal a 14.8 hr modulation , probably orbital in origin , in the light from the 16 - 19th magnitude variable optical counterpart .",
    "distance estimates to the source range from 1.3 kpc ( predehl et al .",
    "1991 ) to @xmath3 kpc ( makishima et al . 1986 ) .",
    "the discovery of radio emission from the source was announced in sood & campbell - wilson ( 1994 ) , and sporadic monitoring has been ongoing over the past @xmath4 months at 36 cm using the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) .",
    "the source was also detected during the southern hemisphere radio survey of x - ray binaries conducted by spencer et al .",
    "durouchoux et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and sood et al .",
    "( 1997 ) discuss the radio behaviour of the source over the past @xmath4 months in the context of x - ray monitoring and similarities to cyg x-1 .",
    "on 1996 july 11 - 14 we observed the source with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , in a high - resolution 6 km configuration .",
    "observations were made simultaneously at 6.3 & 3.5 cm for the first three nights , and at 21.7 & 12.7 cm on the fourth ( in order to obtain broad band spectral coverage ) .",
    "the source was clearly detected on all nights and at all four wavelengths ; the mean flux densities at 21.7 , 12.7 , 6.3 & 3.5 cm are listed in table 1 , and plotted in figure 1 .",
    "gx 339 - 4 has a roughly flat radio spectrum , similar to that of cyg x-3 in quiescence ( e.g. waltman et al .",
    "1994 ) , and indicative of a compact absorbed core . a best fit single power - law ( also indicated in fig .",
    "1 ) has a spectral index ( @xmath5 ) of @xmath6 .",
    "the extension of this relatively flat spectrum to 36 cm was confirmed by most observations on 1996 july 13.5 ( hunstead , private communication ) .",
    "there were clear night - to - night variations in the flux density and spectral index of emission at 6.3 & 3.5 cm ; these will be discussed in the context of simultaneous multi - instrument x - ray observations in a follow - up paper .",
    "there is no evidence in the data for flux variations on timescales of an hour or less of amplitude @xmath7% , unlike the rapid large - amplitude quasi - periodic radio oscillations observed occasionally from grs 1915 + 105 ( pooley 1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "judging by the flux monitoring observations of sood et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the source was in a relatively bright radio state at the time of these observations .",
    "we have mapped the lowest - resolution 21.7 cm data ( figure 2 ) in order to look for arcmin - scale structures such as the extended jets of 1e1740.7 - 2942 & grs 1758 - 258 ( mirabel 1994 ) , the surrounding synchrotron nebula of cir x-1 ( stewart et al . 1991 ) , or bowshocks such as that reported by hunstead , wu & campbell - wilson ( 1997 ) to be be associated with the gro j1655 - 40 jets .",
    "no such structures are evident in our map .",
    "most sources detected at 21.7 and visible in fig .",
    "2 are also in the 36 cm molonglo maps of gx 339 - 4 in durouchoux et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and sood et al .",
    "the nearest reasonably strong source to gx 339 - 4 lies 2 arcmin to the ne .",
    ".mean radio flux densities of gx 339 - 4 at 20 , 13 , 6 & 3 cm obtained with atca over 1996 july 11 - 14 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     however , the most intriguing aspect of the observations was the detection of extended emission from the source in the mapping of the highest - resolution 3.5 cm data ( fig 3 ) .",
    "this feature was first apparent in preliminary mapping of the data at atca , and its existence has subsequently been confirmed by re - mapping of the data both with the miriad software at sussex university , and aips at jodrell bank .",
    "furthermore , the feature is present in maps deconvolved with both the clean algorithm and the maximum entropy procedure , and no similar features appear in the images of any other objects mapped over the period of our entire observing run from july 1 to july 14 .",
    "however , we can not at this stage rule out an origin for the feature in atmospheric phase errors ( though the phase solutions are good ) as the source is not strong enough for self - calibration .",
    "the feature is significant at @xmath8 level , but there is no evidence of a counterjet .",
    "mapping of previous atca observations obtained by spencer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and sood et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reveals no evidence for such a feature , implying a transient nature .",
    "the structure can not be resolved in our lower resolution longer wavelength maps .",
    "removal of a gaussian fit to the core source reveals the plasmon to lie @xmath9 arcsec to the west of gx 339 - 4 , where uncertainties in this process are reflected in the large error estimates .",
    "the lack of an observed counterjet places a lower limit on the ratio of the brightnesses of the approaching and receding components of @xmath3",
    ". both the black - hole candidacy of gx 339 - 4 and the apparent one - sidedness of the jet point to a relativistic ejection . under the assumption of symmetric ejection of identical optically thin plasmons at @xmath2c ( as for grs 1915 + 105 - mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ) , we can place an upper limit on the angle to line of sight of the ejection of @xmath10 .",
    "assuming the observed feature to be the approaching plasmon , we can expect a lower limit on the observed proper motion to be @xmath11(kpc ) arcsec d@xmath12 .",
    "however , caution must be exercised in making these assumptions , in particular as the spectral index of the ejecta is not clear , and ejections from gro j1655 - 40 can reveal an intrinsically asymmetric nature ( hjellming & rupen 1995 ) .",
    "the lack of an observed jet - like structure to a resolution of @xmath13 arcsec in observations made 313 days before ours ( data from spencer et al . 1997 ) , places a lower limit on the velocity of the ejecta of @xmath14 cm s@xmath12 . at a distance of 1.3 kpc",
    "this corresponds to @xmath15c , so even if not relativistic the outflow is clearly high velocity ( but at such a velocity it would need to be intrinsically one - sided as relativistic beaming would not be important ) .",
    "soft x - ray monitoring with the xte asm during the time of our observations is shown in fig 4 .",
    "the source appears to be undergoing an x - ray outburst at the time of the observations , although the overall flux level corresponds to _ off _ , the lowest of the x - ray states ( nowak 1995 and private communication ) .",
    "a poorly - understood but clear relation between x - ray and radio behaviour has already been established for grs 1915 + 105 and gro j1655 - 40 ( foster et al .",
    "1996 ; harmon et al .",
    "1995 ) . given the time required to achieve the observed angular separation , if associated with the outburst the ejection would have needed to occur around the beginning of the x - ray event , which may be consistent with the behaviour of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "note that miyamoto & kitamoto ( 1991 ) have already predicted the existence of a jet in gx 339 - 4 , however this was in order to explain its x - ray properties in the _ very high _ state .",
    "gx 339 - 4 has become the latest black hole candidate x - ray binary to be detected as a variable radio source .",
    "durouchoux et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and sood et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have already discussed possible radio - x - ray correlations in the source , and have compared it to cygnus x-1 , the most famous persistent black hole candidate radio source . in four days of radio observations with atca in high - resolution configuration",
    "we have measured the spectral energy distribution of gx 339 - 4 from 22 - 3 cm and mapped the region of the source on scales from arcmin to arcseconds .",
    "we find a relatively flat ( @xmath16 ) radio spectrum for the emission , indicative of a compact absorbed core .",
    "low - resolution mapping finds no evidence on arcmin - scales for lobes . bow shocks or synchrotron nebulae such as those associated with other radio - jet x - ray binaries .",
    "most intriguingly however we have presented evidence for the existence of a jet - like structure in radio maps of gx 339 - 4 .",
    "if confirmed , this source becomes the first persistent black - hole candidate source to reveal a radio jet .",
    "the importance of the detection of a jet , which is in all likelihood relativistic , from a non - transient black hole candidate x - ray binary can not be understated .",
    "both grs 1915 + 105 and grs j1655 - 40 are transient sources , and while displaying quasi - recurrent behaviour in the 2 - 3 years since their discovery , the lack of detection of these systems by previous x - ray satellites ( lochner & whitlock 1992 ; castro - tirado 1994 ; castro - tirado , private communication ) testifies to prolonged states below detectable levels .",
    "gx 339 - 4 on the other hand is a persistently visible source , both at x - rays and ( at least for past @xmath4 months ) in the radio , and may turn out to be one of our most valuable laboratories in the study of radio jets .",
    "we are happy to acknowledge fruitful and stimulating discussions with ravi sood , philippe durouchoux , mike nowak , alberto castro - tirado , bob sault and vince mcintyre .",
