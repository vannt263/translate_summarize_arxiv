    "chandra _  and _ xmm  newton _",
    "surveys @xcite .",
    "however , even before the launch of _ xmm  newton _  and _ chandra _ , a number of x  ray surveys were carried out using _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , and _ beppo_sax  to investigate the absorbed agn population @xcite .",
    "these surveys covered large areas of sky and so were particularly useful for finding relatively bright , and thus easily studied , examples of the absorbed agn population .",
    "the sources detected in these surveys exhibit interesting , and somewhat surprising properties .",
    "for example , @xcite found that agn from the _ beppo_sax  high energy large area survey ( hellas ) could be divided into two groups according to their optical and near  ir properties .",
    "one group of sources have point - like optical / near  ir counterparts with colours typical of optically selected qsos .",
    "the other group of sources are extended in the optical / near  ir and have colours dominated by the host galaxy stellar population . despite having a wide range of x  ray absorbing column densities up to @xmath4 , none of the sources studied by @xcite appeared to have colours dominated by a reddened agn .",
    "comparison of _ rosat _  and _",
    "beppo_sax  data on hellas sources yielded another unexpected result : @xcite found that a significant fraction of the absorbed objects in hellas have an additional soft component in their x  ray spectra .",
    "this could be due to scattered x ",
    "rays which do not pass through the absorber , alternatively it might indicate a hot gas component as observed in starburst galaxies .",
    "perhaps one of the most puzzling results is that in many agn whose x  ray spectra indicate a substantial absorbing column ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) , the corresponding optical spectrum shows little or no evidence for dust reddening @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the absorbing media of agn typically have much lower dust - gas ratios than the interstellar medium of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "observations of hard x  ray selected , absorbed agn have the potential to reveal much about the dominant , absorbed xrb - producing population of agn . here",

    "periods of high background in the 2001 observation were excised from the event lists , to leave 95 ks of useful exposure time .",
    "there were no periods of high background during the may 2000 observation , so the total useful exposure time of the two observations is 123 ks . at an off axis angle of 8.6 arc minutes",
    ", this corresponds to an effective exposure time of 82 ks at 2 kev .    for the purpose of obtaining an accurate source position ,",
    "images and exposure maps were constructed in the energy band 110 kev .",
    "these images were source searched using the sas routines eboxdetect and emldetect . a linear shift of @xmath11 2 arc seconds , based on the relative position of markarian  766 in the epic images and the 2mass catalogue , was applied to the x  ray position of  to match the optical / ir astrometric reference frame .",
    "we extracted x  ray spectra in the energy range 0.212 kev for the source and background from each exposure , including all valid single , double and triple x  ray event patterns .",
