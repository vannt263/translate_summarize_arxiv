    "quantum information has been attracting computer scientists as a new computing paradigm @xcite . to develop a sound theory for handling such quantum information",
    ", we need to understand the structure of quantum information from the viewpoint of information processing .",
    "some aspect of quantum information is to define a kind of distance between two quantum states .",
    "depending on the specific applications in quantum estimation @xcite , quantum information geometry @xcite , quantum channel capacity @xcite , etc .",
    ", there are many quantum distances , each having meanings in some respective settings .",
    "voronoi diagrams have been playing a central role to represent the proximity relation of point set , etc .",
    ", with a wide variety of applications in many fields .",
    "it is quite natural to investigate the proximity relation via voronoi diagrams of quantum states with respect to such distances .    using the voronoi diagrams of mixed quantum states with respect to the quantum divergence , oto , imai and",
    "imai @xcite introduced a method to calculate holevo capacity .",
    "since there are many kinds of distances between quantum states , we expect that a similar method can be applicable to investigations of other distances .",
    "in addition , to investigate the difference between some two different distances of quantum states , to see if their voronoi diagrams coincide or not can be a good first approach . however , the voronoi diagrams used in @xcite are not defined on pure quantum states .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to investigate if the voronoi diagrams used there can be extended to pure states . in 1-qubit case",
    ", pure states correspond to the surface of bloch ball , and mixed states to the interior .",
    "geometrically , the problem can be express as `` can the voronoi diagram defined only in the interior of the bloch ball be extended to its surface ? ''    moreover , even from other points of view , pure quantum states are quite important and useful . for example , most quantum algorithms have been described using only pure states without using mixed states even if some measurements are performed during the algorithm and quantum states are then better to be treated as mixed ones .    in this paper , we first explain the method to calculate holevo capacity .",
    "this method uses voronoi diagrams for mixed quantum states by the quantum divergence .",
    "secondly , we define voronoi diagrams for pure quantum states on the bloch sphere by the fubini - study distance and the bures distance .",
    "these diagrams are shown to be equivalent to the ordinary voronoi diagram on the sphere .",
    "we also introduce other voronoi diagrams on the sphere which are obtained by taking a limit of the voronoi diagrams used in the calculation of holevo capacity .",
    "finally , all these diagrams  the one by the fubini - study distance , the one by the bures distance , and the one obtained by taking a limit of the diagram in mixed states  are shown to be identical .",
    "consequently , as far as the proximity relation among 1-qubit pure states are uniquely defined for these distances and divergences , it may be regarded to be natural in a sense that geometric structures of pure states are nicer than those of mixed states .",
    "a 1-qubit quantum state is represented by a density matrix @xmath0 : @xmath1 @xmath2 may be identified with a point @xmath3 in the 3-dimensional space , and a ball formed by all such points @xmath4 is called bloch ball . a state with rank 1",
    "is called pure , while a state with rank 2 is called mixed .",
    "points on the boundary of the bloch ball , i.e. , the bloch sphere , corresponds to pure states .    for two pure states @xmath0 and @xmath5 , the fubini - study distance @xmath6",
    "is defined by @xmath7 see hayashi @xcite .",
    "the bures distance @xmath8 @xcite is defined by @xmath9      eigenvalues @xmath10 of @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 . by the eigenvalue decomposition , @xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is @xmath15 for @xmath16 and is 0 for @xmath17 .",
    "then , for a mixed state @xmath11 , @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 in the bloch ball , information - geometric structure can be induced by the von neumann entropy @xmath20 and the quantum divergence @xmath21 .",
    "the von neumann entropy of a state @xmath0 is defined by @xmath22 using the eigenvalues @xmath10 of @xmath0 , it is expressed as @xmath23 i.e. , @xmath20 is the shannon entropy of eigenvalues .",
    "note that @xmath24 .",
    "the quantum divergence @xmath21 for two quantum states @xmath0 and @xmath5 is defined by @xmath25 where @xmath5 is a mixed state .",
    "it is known that @xmath26 , and @xmath27 iff @xmath28 .",
    "now we consider the situation of sending a qubit via a quantum channel @xmath29 with noise and receiving it .",
    "a quantum channel means that @xmath29 is a affine transformation that maps a quantum state to a quantum state .",
    "if @xmath11 is 1-qubit quantum state , the image of @xmath29 @xmath30 is an ellipsoid and included in the bloch ball .",
    "the holevo capacity of this quantum channel is known to be equal to the maximum divergence from the center to a given point and the radius of the smallest enclosing ball .",
    "the holevo capacity @xmath31 of a 1-qubit quantum channel @xmath29 is defined as @xmath32",
    "the method to compute the holevo capacity of a 1-qubit quantum channel is described in @xcite . there ,",
    "the voronoi diagrams of 1-qubit mixed states by quantum divergence are used to solve the smallest enclosing ball problem .",
    "the voronoi diagrams were introduced as a generalization of kullback - leibler divergence @xcite . in this section",
    ", we briefly explain the process of computation and its mathematical background .",
    "we plot sufficiently many points @xmath33 on the sphere and consider the voronoi diagram of the points @xmath34 with respect to the divergence .",
    "if @xmath35 is large enough , we can assume that the radius of the smallest enclosing ball of the points @xmath34 sufficiently approximates the real value of the holevo capacity . to compute the smallest enclosing ball ,",
    "voronoi diagrams are considered as a useful tool .",
    "two voronoi diagrams used here are defined as @xmath36 @xmath37    although our concern is primarily @xmath38 , we first consider @xmath39 because it is easier to compute .",
    "actually , considering the graph of @xmath40 , @xmath41 corresponds to the distance along w - axis between the tangent plain at @xmath42 and the point @xmath3 ( fig.[fig : distance - phi ] ) .",
    "this fact makes it easy to compute the @xmath39 using a lower envelope of the tangent plains ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mes - phi ] ) .",
    "then , we compute @xmath38 as a dual diagram of @xmath39 . to solve the problem",
    ", we consider a dual coordinate system @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath11 such that @xmath44 . their coordinate change is explicitly defined as @xmath45 thus , @xmath38 can be computed from @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , this process to work out @xmath38 from @xmath39 can be extended to a general @xmath46-dimensional case @xcite . now using @xmath38 , the center of the smallest enclosing ball is determined and finally we obtain approximate value of the holevo capacity as the radius of the ball .",
    "we first consider the fubini - study distance @xmath6 for two 1-qubit pure states @xmath2 and @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "first , we have @xmath49 hence , setting @xmath50 to be an angle between two vectors @xmath3 and @xmath42 with @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 in the 1-qubit case , the fubini - study distance between two pure states is a half of the geodetic distance between two corresponding points on the bloch sphere .    concerning the bures distance , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the three - dimensional euclidean distance .",
    "thus , at a first glance , these two distance might look strange , but in the 1-qubit case both are just natural distances .",
    "in fact , one we restrict discussions on pure states only , these are more direct consequences . however , the above formulation is suitable to connect it with mixed states .",
    "this point will be discussed in the concluding remarks .",
    "voronoi diagrams for pure 1-qubit states can be defined by using the fubini - study distance or the bures distance .",
    "suppose @xmath55 pure 1-qubit states @xmath56 @xmath57 are given .",
    "define @xmath58 by @xmath59 which is the voronoi region of @xmath60 with respect to the fubini - study distance .",
    "similarly , @xmath61 with respect to the bures distance can be defined . combining the above - mentioned discussions with results on the ordinary voronoi diagrams on the sphere ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we have the following .    [ th1 ] for @xmath55 1-qubit pure states ,",
    "the following four voronoi diagrams are equivalent :    1 .   the voronoi diagram with respect to the fubini - study distance 2 .",
    "the voronoi diagram with respect to the bures distance 3 .",
    "the voronoi diagram on the sphere with respect to the ordinary geodetic distance 4 .",
    "the section of the three - dimensional euclidean voronoi diagram with the sphere",
    "as described above , the voronoi diagram of 1-qubit states with respect to the quantum divergence plays a very important roll in computation of holevo capacity .",
    "so far , the voronoi diagrams are defined only in mixed states .",
    "actually , while @xmath62 can be defined when an eigenvalue of @xmath0 equals @xmath63 because @xmath64 can be naturally defined as @xmath63 , it is not defined when an eigenvalue of @xmath5 is @xmath63 . here",
    "we show that this voronoi diagram of mixed states can be extended to pure states .",
    "in other words , we prove that even though the divergence @xmath21 can not be defined when @xmath5 is a pure state , the voronoi edges are naturally extended to pure states . to prove this convergence ,",
    "we revisit the geometric structure described in @xcite by presenting explicit expressions .    for a 1-qubit state @xmath2 with @xmath65 ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath0 is given by @xmath66 when @xmath67 , defining a unitary matrix @xmath68 as @xmath69 @xmath0 is expressed as @xmath70 then , @xmath71    for @xmath2 and @xmath47 with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , we have the following : @xmath75\\\\ & & \\qquad +    \\log\\tilde{\\lambda}_2[(1+z)(\\tilde{r}-\\tilde{z})-2(x\\tilde{x}+y\\tilde{y } )    + ( 1-z)(\\tilde{r}+\\tilde{z})]\\\\ & = &   \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2\\tilde{r } }   ( \\log\\tilde{\\lambda}_1[\\tilde{r}+x\\tilde{x}+y\\tilde{y}+z\\tilde{z } ]   + \\log\\tilde{\\lambda}_2[\\tilde{r}-x\\tilde{x}-y\\tilde{y}-z\\tilde{z } ] )   \\smallskip\\\\ & = & \\displaystyle {   \\frac{1}{2}\\log\\frac{1-\\tilde{r}^2}{4 }   + \\frac{\\log(1+\\tilde{r})-\\log(1-\\tilde{r})}{2\\tilde{r } }    [ x\\tilde{x}+y\\tilde{y}+z\\tilde{z } ]   } .\\\\",
    "% = \\frac{1}{2}(\\log\\tilde{\\lambda}_1+\\log\\tilde{\\lambda}_2 ) % + \\frac{1}{2r } [ x\\tilde{x}+y\\tilde{y}+z\\tilde{z } ] %   \\log\\frac{1+\\tilde{r}}{1-\\tilde{r}}\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] when @xmath76 and @xmath77 for this @xmath5 , we have @xmath78 and we now have the following .    for a 1-qubit mixed state @xmath47 with @xmath79 and a general 1-qubit state @xmath2 , @xmath80.\\ ] ]",
    "moreover , @xmath21 converges to @xmath81 as @xmath82 .",
    "this generalize the result and we can naturally assume that the above formula holds for all 1-qubit mixed states .",
    "now we revisit the voronoi diagram defined by the quantum divergence . for a set of mixed states @xmath83 @xmath57 , we can define the voronoi region @xmath84 of @xmath60 .",
    "note that here @xmath85 should be mixed , while @xmath0 can be pure .",
    "suppose a set of pure states @xmath86 @xmath57 is given .",
    "for a small @xmath87 , consider the section of the voronoi diagram of @xmath88 defined by @xmath89 with a sphere of @xmath90 .",
    "define the voronoi diagram @xmath91 of these given pure states for all pure states by the quantum divergence to be the limit of this section with @xmath92 , and denote the voronoi region of @xmath60 in this diagram by @xmath93 .",
    "then , by using the above lemma , we have @xmath94 and see that this diagram is identical with those in the previous section .",
    "similarly as above , we can define @xmath95 for pure @xmath60 , where @xmath0 should be mixed . for the voronoi diagram with respect to the dual divergence @xmath96 , consider its section with a sphere of @xmath90 , and define the voronoi diagram @xmath97 of these given pure states to be the limit of this section with @xmath92 .",
    "the same arguments with @xmath98 can be applied to this case , and we obtain the following .    the voronoi diagrams @xmath98 and @xmath97 for @xmath55 pure states on the bloch sphere are identical to those diagrams in theorem  [ th1 ] .",
    "it should be noted that , for mixed states , the voronoi diagrams @xmath39 and @xmath38 for the same set of quantum states are not identical in general @xcite .",
    "we have shown that in the 1-qubit case the voronoi diagrams defined by various distances and divergences of a finite set of pure states for all pure states are all identical .",
    "this would also hold in the higher - dimensional case , which is left as an open problem .",
    "our investigations on pure states shed light on studying differences among voronoi diagrams with respect to many distances and divergences .",
    "in fact , for pure quantum states , the fubini - study distance is a unique metric once an appropriate differential - geometric invariance is imposed , whereas for mixed quantum states there are so many metrics , such as sld fisher metric , rld fisher metric and bogoljubov fisher metric ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , each having some meaningful implications in some settings . in the case of fundamental information theory and statistics , some relations between the voronoi diagram by the kullback - leibler divergence and that by the hyperbolic distance on the upper half - plane are touched upon @xcite . investigating proximity relations induced by such metrics",
