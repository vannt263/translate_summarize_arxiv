    "during the past decade it has become abundantly clear that there are several sub - classes of two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin liquids .",
    "@xcite perhaps best understood are the topological spin liquids that support gapped excitations which carry fractional quantum numbers . @xcite",
    "another possibility are gapless spin liquids with no topological structure .",

    "these are analogous to the fermi surfaces in a fermi liquid but in such  quantum spin - metals \" a quasiparticle picture will presumably be inapplicable .",
    "spin liquids with a spinon fermi surface are examples of particular interest , and have been studied in a number of rvb works @xcite  most recently as a candidate for a spin liquid phase @xcite in the organic compound @xmath1-(et)@xmath2cu@xmath2(cn)@xmath3 .    developing a theoretical framework for itinerant 2d non - fermi liquids",
    "is arguably even more challenging than for spin liquids . towards this end",
    "recent work@xcite explored the possibility of an uncondensed quantum phase of itinerant bosons in two dimensions which is a conducting fluid but not superfluid .",

    "[ fig : qycuts ] . other examples with critical surfaces have been studied recently in ref .  .",
    "the central idea underlying this paper is that 2d phases of quantum spins and itinerant fermions or bosons with singular surfaces in momentum space should have definite signatures when restricted to a quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) geometry , e.g.  when the system is placed onto an @xmath0-leg ladder . to be concrete ,",
    "suppose we have a singular 2d surface in momentum space in the ground state of some square lattice quantum hamiltonian .",
    "if we put the hamiltonian on an @xmath0-leg ladder , the transverse momentum @xmath5 becomes discrete . with large @xmath0",
    "one would expect that the short - range energetics that stabilizes the 2d phase will still be present on the ladder and will lead to a set of 1d gapless modes where the discrete momenta cut through the singular surface , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : qycuts ] .",
    "the long wavelength physics of these 1d modes will be described in terms of some multi - channel luttinger liquid , behavior different than the parent 2d state .",
    "but the number of gapless 1d modes and their respective momenta characterizing the oscillatory power law decays would provide a distinctive  fingerprint \" of the parent 2d liquid . for example",
    ", the number of gapless 1d modes would grow linearly with @xmath0 and the sum of their momenta could satisfy some generalized luttinger volume .",
    "moreover , these signatures could be potentially exploited to approach the 2d phases from controlled numerical and analytical studies in quasi-1d .",
    "indeed , as we demonstrate explicitly in this paper , the ( putative ) singular surface of the 2d dbl phase is already manifest on the 2-leg ladder",

    "appendix  [ app : gt ] presents a complete low - energy theory of the dbl[2,1 ] which  once the gauge fluctuations are treated  contains two phonon modes and in principle allows calculating all exponents .",
    "since the power laws are affected also by short - range interactions , and there are many parameters allowed in the theory , we do not pursue this calculation in general , but mainly rely on the amperean rules that capture the gauge fluctuation effects ; this is reasonable if the gauge interactions dominate .",

    "the first four involve a particle and a hole of the same species but with opposite group velocities and are therefore expected to be enhanced by the gauge fluctuations ; in the above equations , this is indicated schematically with @xmath48 .",
    "however , these correlators can also be affected  either enhanced or suppressed  by short - range interactions , and without knowing all parameters in the theory , we can not calculate the exponents reliably .",
    "the oscillation at wavevector @xmath46 can be shown to be always suppressed beyond the mean field .",
    "finally , the zero momentum power law remains unchanged .",
    "more details on the dbl[2,1]-phase can be found in appendix  [ app : gt ] . in particular , we show that the two - boson green s function exhibits some internal d - wave character , which originates from the non - trivial wavefunction signs .",
    "it is these signs that prompted the name `` d - wave '' boson liquid ( dbl ) in the 2d continuum setting,@xcite where the wavefunction goes through a sequence of signs @xmath49 upon taking one particle around another .",

    "an obvious virtue of searching for the fingerprint of putative 2d gapless quantum phases in quasi-1d models is the relative numerical and analytic tractability of the latter .",
    "an important requirement of this approach is that the 2d quantum phase has singular correlations along surfaces in momentum space . in this case",
    "the number of 1d gapless modes present on an @xmath0-leg ladder will necessarily scale linearly with @xmath0 . while the particular fingerprint of the 2d quantum phase can already be present on the 2-leg ladder , as was the case for the dbl phase studied exhaustively in this paper , a compelling approach to 2d",

    "but vmc is only as good as the variational wavefunction being employed , and the quality of the wavefunction is hard to assess in the absence of other more accurate methods .",
    "the ground - state energy of all physically reasonable hamiltonians is sensitive almost entirely to very short - range correlations , whereas for gapless quantum systems it is usually the longer range correlations which are necessary in order to distinguish between various competing phases .",
    "quantum states in 2d with gapless critical surfaces in momentum space are somewhat of an exception since the location of such surfaces is presumably due to short - range correlations in the signs and amplitudes of the wavefunction . but the precise singular structure on such surfaces reflects longer range correlations in the wavefunction .",
    "gauge theory@xcite seems to offer one of the few analytic approaches to access putative gapless spin - liquid type quantum phases in 2d that have no quasi - particle description . and",
    "for mean field states having a spinon fermi sea , a controlled inclusion of the gauge fluctuations is problematic , even in the simplest case of a compact @xmath223 gauge field .",

    "but for the ladder systems , gapless fermions ( spinons ) coupled to a @xmath223 gauge field is eminently tractable , although this fact has been exploited rather infrequently.@xcite in 1d the gauge field has no transverse component and the bosonization method can be employed , leading to a gaussian effective field theory for the low energy excitations .",
    "this is another distinctive advantage of studying ladder systems relative to their 2d counterparts .",
    "one extension of this paper involves studying the boson ring hamiltonian on ladders with @xmath224 and larger .",
    "already for @xmath216 there are a number of new features that are not present on the 2-leg ladder .",
    "first , one can consider either periodic or anti - periodic boundary conditions for the bosons in the rung - direction , and it is quite plausible that the phase diagram and the presence / absence of the dbl phase will depend on this choice .",
    "second , while our search for a dbl phase with three gapless modes on the 2-leg ladder was unsuccessful due to instabilities of the dbl[2,2 ] variational state , it seems likely that for @xmath225 a dbl phase with more gapless modes than @xmath0 should be accessible .",
    "this is interesting since in such a case at least two of the 1d modes would have the same transverse momentum .",
    "for a general @xmath0-leg ladder one can construct variational states of the form dbl[@xmath226 , @xmath227 with integer @xmath228 satisfying @xmath229 ( with @xmath230 the number of partially filled bands for the @xmath231 partons , respectively ) . the number of 1d gapless modes in such a phase is @xmath232 , so that dbl[3,2 ] for @xmath216 , say , would have four 1d modes . if @xmath233 the @xmath8 fermion has only one band partially occupied , and assuming the band has @xmath23 , the corresponding variational wavefunction vanishes whenever two or more bosons occupy a rung .",
    "in this case of no - double rung occupancy , the determinant for the @xmath8 fermion can be viewed as a ( strictly ) 1d jordan - wigner string multiplying the @xmath7 determinant . whenever @xmath234 this is no longer the case , and the @xmath8 determinant would have a more subtle effect on the signs of the boson wavefunction .",
    "it would thus be desirable to access a dbl phase with @xmath234 .",
    "as detailed in appendix  [ subapp : dbl22instab ] , the gauge theory suggested an instability of the dbl[2,2 ] state for @xmath235 due to a rather special  nesting \" condition present for @xmath236 . for @xmath237",
