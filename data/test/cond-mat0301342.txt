    "in binary systems , composition - temperature phase diagrams show the regions of phase stability , usually under constant pressure conditions@xcite .",
    "phase transitions in those systems include melting , which is a universal phenomenon in all crystalline materials , eventual phase transitions due to non - miscibility of components and , polymorphous phase transitions that may appear if there is a competition between different crystalline phases of the same material .",
    "the appearance of these latter transitions depends on the atomic scale interactions in the material . in isomorphous alloy systems ( e.g. copper -nickel alloy ) , only a single type of crystal structure is observed .",
    "a more complicated picture appears in alloys with low miscibility of components . in those systems",
    ", clusters having different predominant components may differ in crystalline arrangements .",
    "a known example of an eutectic system is the copper - silver alloy , while that of a monotectic system is given by the copper - lead alloy . .",
    "similarities of melting in different materials allow one to assume that the melting behavior depends on rather general characteristics ( e.g. the particle size , first moments of the interaction potential ) of the interparticle interactions , and that a coarsened statistical model operating with only a few energy parameters may reproduce the main features of those materials . in the present paper , we propose such a coarsened model in terms of structural states of the system small parts .    in",
    "liquids and solids , the interaction of constituent particles is strong and substantially limits the relative positions of particles .",
    "the resulting strong correlation in small volumes of the material is referred to as the local order in condensed systems .",
    "the term  local  refers to a small part of the material , whose size may be estimated from the correlation functions as including one or more coordination shells .",
    "we refer to this small part as a cluster . to account for the limitations imposed on relative positions of cluster particles by the local order",
    ", one describes the particle arrangements in terms of local order parameters .",
    "the concept of local order assumes a coarsening of description to a space scale larger than the interatomic distance .",
    "the resulting model is then a simplification that allows one to understand the global ordering in terms of the local order .    in simple liquids ( e.g. noble gas liquids ) , radial correlation functions @xcite",
    "show some order in the first coordination shell , and a weaker correlation of particles positions in the second and higher correlation shells .",
    "the possibility to describe these liquids in terms of a definite local order is an open question . in liquids with stronger interaction of particles , and especially with covalent or / and hydrogen bonding ,",
    "one expects the local order to be stronger , and closer to the local arrangement in a crystal .",
    "this will be referred to as a crystalline local arrangement .    in the current article",
    ", we consider a material in which the local order is maintained by a strong short range interaction , so that this local order does not significantly change even when the global order is lost by melting . in such a material , the loss of the global order during melting results from proliferation of topological defects , with the density of these defects small enough to allow recognition of the crystalline local structure . in the crystalline state ,",
    "orientations of all clusters almost coincide , while in the liquid the orientations become uncorrelated above some finite distance . for a single component material or an isomorphous system with only one type of local order , a model of melting based on the above physical picture",
    "was studied earlier @xcite .",
    "a more general theory of melting that accounts for amorphous inherent structures is studied in a recent paper@xcite .    in a crystalline two - component alloy with limited miscibility of components , one deals at least with two types of local order corresponding to phases with the predominance of one component . in the materials considered",
    ", the short - range interaction energetically favors , for each sort of atoms , the same sort of particles in the nearest neighborhood .",
    "the physical picture of the alloy is then a cluster - scale solution .",
    "close to the phase separation caused by non - miscibility , the material is a solution of one type of clusters in the matrix of the other type of local structure @xcite .",
    "this suggestion determines the choice of cluster states in our model .    in what follows ,",
    "we propose a model for an alloy based on the above physical picture .",
    "the meta - hamiltonian of the model is written in terms of a local order parameter describing two possible predominant configurations in small elements of the material .",
    "the particle arrangement in such a small element is assumed to be of crystalline type , with orientations of these crystalline arrangements being the fluctuating characteristics .",
    "we study the phase transitions and the phase diagram in this model .",
    "we divide the material in equal small parts ( clusters ) of cubic shape .",
    "the centers of these clusters form a simple cubic lattice with sites having coordinates @xmath0 . in accordance with the discussion in the previous section",
    ", we assume that the relative positions of cluster particles are , within the accuracy of small thermal displacements and possible packing defects , of a crystalline type .",
    "the crystalline local arrangement is anisotropic .",
    "one can characterize the space orientation of this anisotropy by introducing local crystalline axes . in the crystal state ,",
    "the orientations of these axes are close to the corresponding orientations of some global axes characterizing the crystal on a macroscopic length scale . in a non - crystalline state ,",
    "the orientation of local crystalline axes become , together with the type of the local crystalline anisotropy and the local composition , a fluctuating degree of freedom . in our model , we consider only this degrees of freedom . the universal contribution to thermodynamic properties coming from the small oscillations of atoms in the vicinity of an energy minimum configuration",
    "may be found , for a classical system , from a rather general consideration@xcite .    to simplify the modeling , we coarsen the orientation description in a way proposed in @xcite .",
    "namely , we divide the orientation space of a cluster in orientation cells comprising only slightly differing orientations , and characterize the orientation state of a cluster by the number  @xmath1   of the orientation cell .",
    "the size of an orientation cell , and thus the number @xmath2 of orientation states , will be discussed later .",
    "we assign to a cluster situated at the point @xmath0 @xcite an @xmath2-component vector @xmath3 by the condition that @xmath4 when the orientation state of the cluster is @xmath5 , and @xmath6 otherwise .",
    "the global state of the material is characterized by the configuration @xmath7 and described by the field @xmath3 at all points @xmath0 .",

    "the technique of meta - hamiltonians ( effective hamiltonian , nonequilibrium thermodynamic potential ) in the coarsened statistical description of condensed systems was developed in the theory of critical phenomena ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . to obtain @xmath12",

    "one may use these coefficients as new thermodynamic coordinates instead of p and/or t. to be specific , we consider a system at a given pressure p ; the thermodynamic coordinates of the state are the temperature t and component concentrations .",
    "a change of the pressure will change , in general , the meta - hamiltonian .",
    "the form of the meta - hamiltonian follows from rather general physical arguments @xcite .",
    "one expects @xmath16 to include independent contributions from single clusters ( one - cluster part ) , each such contribution @xmath17 depending only on the state @xmath18 of the corresponding cluster .",
    "the interaction of neighboring clusters is described by terms depending on states of more than one cluster . here , we only consider two - cluster interactions .",
    "the reason is that the interacting potentials acting between particles have a range shorter then the cluster size , so the interaction is strong only for clusters sharing a border .",
    "then , for a system in homogeneous external conditions , the general form of the meta - hamiltonian is @xmath19 here and below , the einstein s summation rule is supposed for repeating indices .",
    "let us define the field @xmath20 as @xmath21 the partition function @xmath22 is a sum over all local states in all clusters .",

    "the saddle - point approximation is known to fail at critical points ; for phase transitions of the first ehrenfest order , the saddle - point approximation may be expected to adequately describe the thermodynamics of the system and phase transitions . in the present article",
    "we shall restrict ourselves with the first saddle - point approximation .",
    "the saddle - point configuration @xmath41 minimizes the thermodynamic potential @xmath42 in ( [ z2 ] ) , it obeys the equation : @xmath43 , \\nonumber \\\\ z_0=\\sum_i\\exp [ \\frac 1t(e_{ij}\\psi _ j(r)+\\alpha _ i)].\\label { eq1 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] to obtain the generating functional @xmath24 one substitutes the solution of this equation in ( [ z2 ] ) . for the probability @xmath44 one",

    "because of this probabilistic character of the quantity @xmath47 , we will call the saddle point approximation the mean - probability approximation ( mpa ) .",

    "the equations ( [ mpa ] ) have , in general , more than one solution ; the number of solutions depends on the values of the parameters @xmath55 as mentioned above , the characteristics @xmath56 depend on thermodynamic coordinates of the state ( temperature , pressure etc . ) , and may be used as new thermodynamic variables .",
    "different solutions correspond to different phases of the system . in the vicinity of the first order phase transition , one expects at least two minima of @xmath42 , corresponding to the stable and metastable phases , with the lowest minima corresponding to the stable phase . by specifying the form of the matrix @xmath57 ,",
    "one arrives at different models .",
    "some of these models are discussed in following sections .",
    "in this section , we discuss a coarsened model for melting in a single - component material @xcite .",
    "the discussion serves as an introduction to the modeling in the next section ; a more detailed study of one - component melting may be found in ref.@xcite . here",
    ", the material is supposed to preserve the same crystalline local order both in the crystal and in the liquid state .",
    "the only degrees of freedom described by the model are the local orientations . to give a coarsened description of orientation order - disorder , one divides the cluster orientation space in angular cells . by definition ,",
    "all orientations within a given angular cell correspond to the same cluster orientation state , labelled by the angular cell number . the number of cluster orientation states is then determined by the size of an angular cell . with increase of the angular cell size ,",
    "the description becomes more coarse .",
    "we choose this size to model the main features of the system in a most schematic way .    in accordance with the experimental data , the ground state ( the state having the lowest energy ) is a crystal , with all clusters occupying the same angular cell .",
    "the globally amorphous ( but locally crystalline in materials under consideration ) global state of the material has a higher energy .",
    "this implies an angular attraction between neighboring clusters : the meta - hamiltonian is at minimum when their orientations coincide and all clusters form an ideal crystal .",
    "one could expect that this angular attraction has an angular size , so that the two - cluster contribution to the meta - hamiltonian increases sharply with the disorientation of the clusters , and then substantially flattens when the mutual disorientation becomes larger than the angular attraction size .",
    "we choose the size of the angular cell equal the angular attraction region .",
    "then , a simple schematic way to model the energetics of neighboring cluster interactions is to assign an angular binding energy @xmath58 to two neighboring clusters belonging to the same orientation cell ( having the same orientation state ) .",
    "the interaction energy of two neighboring clusters having different orientation states is chosen as the origin of the energy scale @xmath59 the resulting model with only one angular energy characteristics has the form of an @xmath2 state potts model with the matrix @xmath60 having the form @xmath61 the assumed equivalence of all orientation states leads to a high symmetry .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is now state - independent and may be put equal to zero without loss of generality . in the symmetric high - temperature phase ,",
    "all @xmath2 equivalent states have equal probabilities @xmath62 at lower temperatures , this symmetry is spontaneously broken . at these temperatures ,",
    "one of the states , which we label by @xmath63 , is more probable than the others ( @xmath64 ) , while n-1 states @xmath18=2 , ... , n have equal probabilities @xmath65    from the minimum condition for the non - equilibrium potential f ( see ( [ gamma1 ] ) ) one obtains the mpa equation ( [ mpa ] ) ( see @xcite ) @xmath66 here , @xmath67 with @xmath68 being the effective number of cluster neighbors .",
    "depending on the temperature , the mpa equation has different solutions describing the high - temperature and the low temperature phases . in the high - temperature phase ,",
    "all states have equal probabilities @xmath69 so that the quantity @xmath70 equals zero .",
    "this solution ( @xmath71 ) formally exists at all temperatures but corresponds to a minimum of  @xmath42 , and thus to a stable or metastable state ,  only at  @xmath72 .",
    "the low - temperature solution  @xmath73   exists at  @xmath74 .",
    "the transition from the low - temperature ( @xmath75 ) to the high temperature , symmetric phase ( @xmath71 ) takes place at  @xmath76 @xmath77 ; this transition is of the first ehrenfest order ( discontinuous ) . for  @xmath78   the temperatures @xmath79 may be found in explicit form : @xmath80 the model may be applied to chemical compositions of stoichiometric compounds behaving like pure materials @xcite .",
    "the necessary condition of applicability is that the local order should not be destroyed via melting , including the chemical order ( the material should not dissociate ) .    in multicomponent materials",
    "there may be a competition of several types of local structure . in a binary system",
    "@xmath81  , these competing structures may correspond to pure components and to all intermediate stoichiometric compositions .",
    "the existence of competing structures enhances the set of local states . in the following section ,",
    "we generalize the above model to account for two competing types of local order .",
    "in this section , we propose and discuss an idealized model of a material with two possible local structures . to account for the type of local structure as a new degree of freedom , we introduce two indices for labelling the local state .",
    "the vector @xmath82 is now written as @xmath83 the upper index corresponds to the type of local order , while the lower one numerates the orientations of a cluster .",
    "as in the previous section , we assume division of the orientation space into orientation cells , with @xmath84 orientation states for the first and @xmath85 for the second local structure .",
    "the meta - hamiltonian of the model may be written in the form @xmath86 the parameter @xmath87 describes the internal energy difference between two local structures .",
    "as in the case of a one - component system , we choose the angular cell sizes to comprise the angular attraction regions .",
    "the kernel @xmath88 of interaction is assumed to differ from zero only for nearest neighbors , and to have the form @xmath89 the interaction between clusters of same composition is chosen in the potts form discussed in the previous section .",
    "the interaction between clusters having different local structures ( the term @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) is assumed to be orientation - independent ; the argument here is that if clusters with different structures share a boundary , then the energy of the boundary @xmath92   is mostly due to the difference in the neighboring structures and less due to their relative orientations .",
    "parameters  @xmath93   characterize then the orientational interaction of same type clusters , and  @xmath94 is an inter - structural  surface  energy",
    ". we will denote @xmath95    > from symmetry arguments , one has for the mean values of the parameter @xmath96 ( see the previous section ) : @xmath97 here ,  @xmath98   is the concentration of clusters having the first structure .",
    "the quantities @xmath99and @xmath100 in ( [ sigma ] ) describe the orientational ordering ; the lower index 1 labels the preferred orientation in the orientationally ordered ( crystalline ) state .",
    "now one is able to classify the possible phases in the model :    1 .",
    "@xmath101   - crystal with the first type of local structure ( c1 ) ; 2 .",
    "@xmath102   - liquid with the first type of local structure ( l1 ) ; 3 .",

    "consider a binary system in which the two local structures correspond to phases with predominance of component @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively .",
    "if these phases are stoichiometric compositions , the model describes the material in some range of intermediate concentrations ; we assume that no other stoichiometric composition can add a third type of local order .",
    "we consider systems in which the two types of local order differ sharply ( have different groups of local symmetry or incompatible interatomic distances ) .",
    "systems with limited miscibility usually exhibit a sharp decrease of melting temperature with deviation from the stoichiometric compound @xcite .",

    "the proposed model may be compared with other known models for the melting transition .",
    "an early model of melting is the landau theory with a scalar order parameter ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) in which a cubic term is postulated to result in a first order phase transition . in this approach , the nature of the transition and the short - range order in the material are not considered . on the opposite extreme , one can calculate the thermodynamic potentials for the liquid and crystalline phases using  realistic  interatomic interaction potentials@xcite , by numerical techniques .",

    "similar models are being used to describe magnetic @xcite and ferroelectric @xcite ordering .",
    "these general behaviors can , as we have shown , be understood in terms of a very simple potts - type model that includes only a small number of physical parameters characterizing the energy difference between local crystalline states , and the energy due to interfacial interaction between two neighboring clusters of same or different types .",
    "these parameters are physically meaningful , and they seem to be adequate to discuss the phase diagram of binary systems .",
    "we thank boris i. shumilo , antoni c.mitus and michael v.chertkov for many discussions of crystalline ordering .",
