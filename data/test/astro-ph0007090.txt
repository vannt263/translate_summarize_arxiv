    "overall spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of bl lacs and blazars in general show two broad peaks : the synchrotron one at low energies and the inverse compton scattering peak at high energies .",
    "the position of the synchrotron peak defines different classes of bl lacs : the hbl ( high - peaked bl lacs ) and the lbl ( low - peaked bl lacs ) .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) propose a sequence for blazars in which the energy of the peak is anti - correlated with the bolometric luminosity , and fainter objects , as hbl , should have a peak in the uv  x - ray band .",
    "1es 1101232 ( z=0.186 ) is an extreme case of hbl in which the synchrotron component peaks in the x - ray band ( @xmath0 1 kev ) , as shown by our previous observation ( wolter et al .",
    "1998 ) . even if not as extreme as that of the flaring states of mkn 501 ( pian et al . 1998 ) and 1es 2344 + 514 ( catanese et al .",
    "1998 ) , the sed of 1es 1101232 makes it a good candidate for tev emission .",
    "has observed 1es1101232 on two occasions , on 4 jan 97 and 19 jun 98 . a single power law fit with galactic absorption at low energy",
    "is rejected for both observations , while a broken power law yields an acceptable @xmath1 . in wolter",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) all the details of the fits are reported .",
    "the broken power law model is preferred , from a statistical point of view besides for physical reasons , even over a single power law with intrinsic absorption . the pds observations , being so short , are not of sufficient statistical significance to put a real constraint on the spectrum .",
    "the position of the break energy ( @xmath2 ) and the slope of the low energy part of spectrum ( @xmath3 ) are the same in the two observations within the errors . on the contrary",
    ", the portion of the spectrum at higher energies ( i.e. above @xmath2 ) has changed between the two observations .",
    "we therefore fit the two datasets together , by using an appropriate model ; the best fit of a broken power law model , in which only the high energy index @xmath4 is untied between the two observations , is acceptable ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the fluxes are consistent with those obtained by the separate fits . only the intensity above 2 kev changed ( of @xmath5 ) between the two observations .",
    "even if the flux variation is small , this result might bear an impact on spectral variability models in bl lacs .",
    "0.2 cm    by using the same data as reported in wolter et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and adding the second  observation we construct the sed of figure 1 and 2 . furthermore",
    ", 1es1101 - 232 has been observed on the nights of 19 - 27 may 1998 with the durham university mark 6 atmospheric @xmath6erenkov telescope ( chadwick et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the source was not detected and an upper limit of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 gev ) = 3.7 @xmath9 photons @xmath10 s@xmath11 has been derived from the observation .",
    "this value also has been plotted in figure 1 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,^ , > , > \" , ]     broken p.l . with @xmath12=@xmath13 ; @xmath3 and @xmath2 tied between the two datasets . + @xmath14 unabsorbed flux [ 2 - 10 kev ] in @xmath15 .",
    "[ fit2 ]    we can reproduce the observed sed by using the homogeneous synchrotron  self compton model described in detail in ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . a power - law distribution of electrons with slope @xmath16 and minimum lorentz factor @xmath17 is continuously injected in a spherical region with radius @xmath18 .",
    "the source is in relativistic motion toward the observer and relativistic effects are expressed by the doppler factor @xmath19 .",
    "electrons are free to cool and form the low energy flat spectrum with spectral index @xmath20 .    the model over - imposed on the sed is derived assuming a radius of @xmath21 cm , @xmath22=15 , @xmath23 erg / s ; @xmath24 , with no external photons .",
    "the slope of the injected electrons is @xmath25=2.7 ( 1998 ) or @xmath25=1.95 ( 1997 ) .",
    "@xmath26 = 0.6 gauss ( and @xmath27 ) for the continuous line ; @xmath26 = 1.2 gauss ( and @xmath28 ) for the dashed line .",
    "a small change in the magnetic field , while still consistent with the x - ray ( ) observations ( see figure 1 ) , produces a very different tev emission .",
    "the tev band data can therefore put stringent constraints on the magnetic field .",
    "the tev upper limit indicates that the compton peak can not be higher than the synchrotron peak ( @xmath29 ) ; using the analytical relations discussed in tavecchio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we can calculate the minimum @xmath26 allowed by the observed tev upper limit for different values of @xmath30 and @xmath19 .",
    "the values that produce a sed in agreement with both the x - ray spectra and the tev upper limit are very similar to those found for mkn 501 ( e.g. @xmath31 and @xmath26=0.2 g ; kataoka et al .",
    "1999 ) implying that the physical conditions of the two sources are also quite similar .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 1es 1101 - 232 is fitted by a broken power law ( a single or an absorbed power law are not statistically acceptable ) with a break at 1.3 - 1.9 kev . from the first to the second observation , the spectrum varied at high energies , becoming softer ( steeper ) .",
    "the flux has therefore decreased by about 32% , in the 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "the tev observation has not yielded a detection . however , since the tev emission is largely sensitive to parameters like the magnetic field that produces the synchrotron emission , interesting limits can be put on this quantity .",
    "of course , more sensitive tev instruments will produce more stringent constraints on the higher energy part of the spectrum and therefore on the emission mechanisms .",
