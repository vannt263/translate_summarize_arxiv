    "much attention has been recently devoted to the notion of quantum entanglement for its potential applications in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , quantum entanglement holds a fundamental role in quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , and has been proved to be necessary for an exponential speed  up of quantum computation over classical computation .    for these reasons ,",
    "a lot of efforts have been devoted to characterize entanglement and experimental measurements have demonstrated that it can affect the macroscopic properties of solids @xcite .",
    "for example , chen _ et al .",
    "_ analyzed in @xcite entanglement of the ground states in xxz and dimerized heisenberg spin chains as well as in two  leg ladder by using the spin ",
    "spin concurrence and the entanglement entropy between a selected sublattice of spins and the rest of the system .",
    "et al . _ showed in @xcite the energy spectrum , pair  correlation functions and the degree of entanglement of two  electron states in self ",
    "assembled inas / gaas quantum dot molecules via all  bound  state configuration interaction calculation and compared these quantities in different levels of approximations .",
    "et al _ performed in @xcite the quantitative evaluation of the entanglement dynamics in scattering events between two indistinguishable electrons interacting via coulomb potential in 1d and 2d semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "they followed the idea introduced by schliemann @xcite and extended by other outhors @xcite , @xcite , since it allows to use a density matrix in the spatial coordinates and to compute the von neumann entropy .",
    "such an approach is based on an analogous of the schmidt decompostion for state vectors of two fermionic particles : through an unitary transformation the antisymmetric wave function is expressed into a basis of slater determinants with a minimum number of non  vanishing terms . this number , known as slater rank , is a criterion to identify whether a system is entangled or not , which involves the evaluation of the von neumann entropy of one particle reduced density matrix . in order to exploit entanglement in quantum computation also",
    "more complex molecules are studied .",
    "for example , the researchers of hahn  meitner  institut are working on the realization of molecular quantum computers whose quantum bits could be formed by fullerenes with a single nitrogen or phosphorus atom trapped inside .",
    "for this reason , it is important to investigate the properties of some molecules and the interaction among them .",
    "a study of this kind is carried out in this paper . here",
    ", the starting point is the so  called collin s conjecture @xcite , that is , the correlation energy in molecular systems is proportional to their entropy .",
    "this conjecture was confirmed by numerical evidence by ramirez _",
    "_ @xcite and taken up by huang and kais in @xcite who interpreted the degree of entanglement as an evaluation of correlation energy .",
    "entanglement is in fact a physical observable directly measured by the von neumann entropy of the system .",
    "this concept is used in order to give a physical meaning to the electron correlation energy , which is not directly observable since it is defined as the difference between the total energy of a given molecular system , with respect to the one obtained with the hartree ",
    "fock approximation method .",
    "the hartree  fock method , in fact , is typically used to solve schrdinger equation for a multi  electron atom or molecule described in the fixed  nuclei approximation ( born  oppenheimer approximation ) by the electronic molecular hamiltonian and the calculation of the error due to this approximation is a major problem in many  body theory and a vast amount of work has been done on this subject @xcite .    in this work , we make a measurement of electron entanglement in two different examples of bipartite systems , as @xmath0 molecule and the dimer of ethylene , where each hydrogen atom or each ethylene molecule , respectively , can be considered a qubit . in this article , firstly , we decide the method we use to make a measurement of entanglement comparing the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath1 and the von neumann entropy of the density matrix @xmath2 for the @xmath0 molecule .",
    "after , fixed that the most convenient method to adopt is the second , @xmath3 , we make a measurement of entanglement in a many  body system represented by a dimer of ethylene and we compare it with its electron correlation energy . finally ,",
    "using the klein s inequality for a bipartite system , we define the interaction electron entanglement in order to study the degree of entanglement between the two molecules of the dimer .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in * sec .",
    "2 * we briefly resume what entanglement is @xcite ( equivalently , when a state is separable or entangled @xcite ) and why we choose the von neumann entropy to make an estimate of the degree of entanglement . in * sec .",
    "3 * we first analyze a dimer of ethylene considering it as a multielectrons system , calculate the correlation energy , and then compare it with the entanglement , as a function of the distance between the two molecules . in * sec .",
    "4 * we introduce a new quantity , the _ interaction electron entanglement _ , which is defined as @xmath4 - 2s[c_{2}h_{4}]$ ] , in order to obtain the entanglement between the two molecules of the dimer .",
    "then , we change the relative orientation and the distance between the molecules , in order to obtain the configuration corresponding to maximum entanglement . in this way",
    ", the system can be considered bipartite and each molecule can be seen as a qubit for an application to quantum computing . in * sec .",
    "5 * we explain some computational details describing the package we use and how we prepare the input for the compound systems that we analyzed . finally , in * sec .",
    "6 * some comments and results are discussed .",
    "in quantum mechanics one generally distinguishes between _ pure states _ and _ mixed states _",
    "depending on the information one has on the state in which a physical system actually is @xcite .",
    "pure states are usually introduced whenever one wants to describe a pysical system that is in a given state with certainty , and are represented by unit vectors @xmath5 of the hilbert space associated with the system .",
    "equivalently a pure state can be represented by a density operator @xmath6 which is such that @xmath7 .",
    "whenever one does nt know exactly in which state the system is , but there is only a probability @xmath8 for the system to be in the pure state represented by @xmath9 , then one tipically says that the system is in a mixed state and represents it by the density operator @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the density operator associated with the pure state @xmath14 .",
    "contrary to a pure state , a mixed state is such that @xmath15 .",
    "the most important consequences of the mathematical structure of the state space reveal in the study of compound systems .",
    "in fact , let us consider a physical system @xmath16 made up by the two subsystems @xmath17 and @xmath18 whose states are represented by the elements of the hilbert spaces @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "then , the system @xmath16 is described by @xmath21 and a pure state of @xmath16 can be represented by the unit vector @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be orthonormal bases on the hilbert space @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "a pure state of @xmath25 can be expressed in the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "thus , if the state @xmath22 can be written as a tensor product of an element of @xmath19 and an element of @xmath20 , as in the following , @xmath28 , we say that @xmath29 is a _ product _ ( or _ separable _ , or _",
    "factorizable _ ) pure state",
    ". a pure state of a pair of quantum systems is called entangled if it is unfactorizable . according to a well known theorem due to von neumann @xcite ,",
    "the vector @xmath30 can be expressed in the so  called _ schmidt decomposition _ : @xmath31 .",
    "then , @xmath5 is a product state if there is only one schmidt coefficient different from zero ( if @xmath32 in the sum ) . on the contrary , if there are more than one non ",
    "zero schmidt coefficients ( if @xmath33 in the sum ) the pure state is entangled .    as a simple bipartite system ,",
    "let us consider the @xmath0 molecule , whose hilbert space can be represented by : @xmath34\\otimes \\big[\\mathscr l^{m}(2 ) \\otimes \\mathscr s^{2}(2)\\big]=\\mathscr c^{2m}(1)\\otimes\\mathscr c^{2m}(2),\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the orbital and the spin space , respectively ; in brackets we denote one of the two electrons while the index represents the dimension of the space",
    ".    in the occupation number representation @xcite @xmath37 the subscripts denote the spatial orbital index and with this notation let us introduce an orthonormal basis for each space @xmath38 : @xmath39 a pure two - electron state @xmath40 can be written in this representation as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the vacuum state , the coefficients @xmath43 satisfy , accordingly to pauli exclusion principle the following requests : @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the creation and annihilation operators of single  particle states , respectively , whose action on the vacuum state is @xmath47 the coefficients @xmath43 can be calculated by using the configuration interaction method @xcite , @xcite . in particular , for @xmath0 molecule we use configuration interaction single ",
    "double ( cisd ) method that is limited to single and double excitations : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the ground state hartree ",
    "fock wave function , @xmath50 is the coefficient for single excitation from orbital @xmath51 to @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the double excitation from orbital @xmath51 and @xmath54 to @xmath52 and @xmath55 . in the occupation number representation ,",
    "the cisd wave function is given by @xmath56 where each `` 1 '' represents the presence of the electron and the subscript represents the site where the electron is @xcite .    in order to realize",
    "whether the state of the compound system is entangled or not , we have to construct the corresponding reduced density matrix . indeed , the vector @xmath5 represents a product state of the compound system if and only if the corresponding reduced density operators represent pure states ( equivalently , @xmath5 is an entangled state if and only if the corresponding reduced density operators formally represent mixed states ) .",
    "hence , if we want to measure the degree of entanglement we can calculate the degree of mixedness of the corresponding reduced density operator ( or matrix ) @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that an entangled state gives rise to correlations whose information is lost if we only observe the subsystems , as it results from the fact that we effectively have a mixed state .    of particular significance for describing randomness of a state and mixedness of density operators",
    "is the _ von neumann entropy _ , defined as @xmath57 it is important to note that @xmath58 is a non  negative trace class operator , while @xmath59 is not .",
    "in analogy with classical entropy , @xmath59 measures the amount of randomness in the state @xmath58 .",
    "more precisely , the entropy @xmath59 is zero if and only if the state is pure , and it is maximized when @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the dimension of the hilbert space . in other words , the more mixed is the reduced density operator , the more entangled is the original state and this result can be seen as a justification for the use of entropy as a measurement of quantum entanglement .",
    "thus , the entanglement of a pure state of a pair of quantum systems can be obtained as entropy of either member of the pair , consequently , in order to calculate the degree of electron entanglement in the @xmath0 molecule we have to calculate the von neumann entropy of the density matrix reduced with respect to an electron .",
    "starting from the density matrix @xmath62 , we obtain the reduced density matrix by making the partial trace relative to all the occupation numbers except @xmath63 ( see appendix a ) @xmath64 @xmath65      the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath67 represents the degree of entanglement : @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 in order to make a generalization of this method to multipartite systems , we decide to measure the degree of entanglement as the von neumann entropy of the density matrix corresponding to the compound system : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the so called _ natural spin orbitals _ ( the eigenvalues of @xmath58 ) .",
    "we compare the behaviours of the entanglement obtained with the cisd coefficients method or with the natural spin orbital method , calculated as a function of internuclear distance @xmath74 .",
    "thus , in the basis @xmath77 , @xmath78 reads @xmath79 equation ( [ densitan1 ] ) represents the density operator for the level @xmath80 and it is important to spend some words on the entryes of the matrix : @xmath81 represents the excitations on the second level so , in the two level system that we consider , @xmath81 is associated with the probability that @xmath80 is empty ; @xmath82 is associated with the possibility that the two electrons are in @xmath80 , the coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath84 are associated with the probability that @xmath80 can be occupated by one eletron .",
    "this fact allows us to introduce the following notation : @xmath85 where @xmath86 denoted an empty orbital , @xmath87 denotes two accupied orbitals and @xmath88 denotes one electron occupied orbital . in order to obtain some informations about one of the two electrons",
    ", we have to make tha partial trace of @xmath78 respect one of the sites of the level @xmath80 ( @xmath89 ) :    @xmath90 in terms of cisd expansion coefficients , the transition amplitude @xmath91 can be written as @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , hence @xmath96 becames : @xmath97 eq ( [ reddensh ] ) is obtained as a generalization of this model to a _ _ m__level system .",
