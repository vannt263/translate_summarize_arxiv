    "it is now widely accepted that stars form predominantly within clusters inside dense clumps of molecular clouds that are turbulent and magnetized . however ,",
    "how clusters form in such dense clumps remains poorly understood .",
    "this is due in part to the lack of the observational characterization of processes involved in cluster formation . in particular , the role of magnetic fields in cluster formation is a matter of debate .",
    "recent numerical simulations of cluster formation suggest that a moderately - strong magnetic field is needed to impede star formation in molecular clouds in order for the simulated star formation rates to match observed values @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite claim that the magnetic field in molecular clouds should be significantly weak ( a few @xmath1 g ) and that the turbulent compression largely controls the structure formation in molecular clouds on scales of a few to several parsecs .",
    "such a very weak magnetic field is necessary to reproduce the core mass spectrum that resembles the stellar initial mass spectrum in shape , in the context of their turbulent fragmentation scenario @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "strong magnetic fields sometimes observed in dense clumps and cores are due to local amplification by the turbulent compression .",
    "recent zeeman measurements in molecular clouds and cores appear to support this idea @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the magnetic fields associated with cluster - forming clumps are expected to be distorted significantly by the supersonic turbulent flows .    in order to characterize the magnetic structure of cluster - forming clumps , it is important to uncover the global magnetic field structures associated with as many cluster forming clumps as possible .",
    "polarimetry of background star light is one of the techniques suitable for mapping the magnetic fields in molecular clouds and cores @xcite and the technique is now strengthened with wide - field polarimetry by employing large array detectors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a continuation of our recent polarimetry study of the serpens cloud core @xcite , which revealed an hour - glass shaped magnetic field that implies the global gravitational contraction of the cluster forming clump , we have made near - infrared polarization observations toward serpens south .",
    "serpens south is a nearby ( @xmath2260 pc ) , embedded cluster , discovered by @xcite in the context of the spitzer gould belt legacy survey .",
    "the serpens south cluster appears to be located at the constricted region in a long filamentary cloud or at the joint region of multiple less dense filaments - now referred to as a `` hub - filament '' structure @xcite .",
    "the serpens cloud core resembles such morphology , although the filamentary structures are much more prominent around serpens south . in the central part of the cluster , the fraction of protostars ( class 0/i sources ) reachs 77 % with a high surface density of 430 pc@xmath3 .",
    "this fraction is largest among the cluster - forming regions within the nearest 400 pc .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered 5 class 0 sources in the central core as a part of the herschel gould belt survey .",
    "these observations strongly suggest a very recent initialization of star formation in this region .",
    "therefore , serpens south is one of the best objects to characterize the initial conditions of cluster formation .    here",
    ", we present the results of our near - infrared polarization measurements , and discuss the role of magnetic fields in the formation of this region .",
    "simultaneous polarimetric observations were carried out toward serpens south in @xmath4s - bands on 2009 august 28 and september 3 , and 2010 june 25 , august 9 , 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 ut with the imaging polarimeter sirpol ( polarimetry mode of the sirius camera : * ? ? ? * ) mounted on the irsf 1.4 m telescope at the south africa astronomical observatory .",
    "the sirius camera is equipped with three 1024 @xmath0 1024 hgcdte ( hawaii ) arrays , @xmath4s filters , and dichroic mirrors , which enables simultaneous @xmath4s observations @xcite .",
    "the field of view at each band is @xmath5 with a pixel scale of 0.45 , and a 3@xmath03 mosaic area centered around ( r.a .",
    ", decl.)@xmath6=(18@xmath730@xmath805@xmath9 , -0203 ) was covered , including duplicate field observations .",
    "we obtained 10 dithered exposures , each 10 or 15 s long , at four wave - plate angles ( 0@xmath10 , 22@xmath10.5 , 45@xmath10 , and 67@xmath10.5 in the instrumental coordinate system ) as one set of observations and repeated this nine or six times , respectively .",
    "thus , the total on - target exposure time for each field was 900 s per wave - plate angle .",
    "sky images were also obtained in between target observations .",
    "self sky images were also used with the sky images to make better median sky images .",
    "the average seeing was @xmath111.@xmath124 at @xmath13s during the observations with a range of @xmath111.@xmath1221.@xmath126 .",
    "twilight flat - field images were obtained at the beginning and/or end of the observations .",
    "standard reduction procedures were applied with iraf .",
    "aperture polarimetry was performed at @xmath14 and @xmath13s with an aperture of @xmath11fwhm by using aphot of the daophot package .",
    "no polarimetry for j band sources was done due to their much smaller number , compared with those of @xmath14 and @xmath13s band sources .",
    "the 2mass catalog @xcite was used for absolute photometric calibration .",
    "see @xcite for more details of the data reduction procedure and the method to derive the polarization degree ( @xmath15 ) and its error ( @xmath16 ) , and the polarization angle ( @xmath17 in p.a . ) and its error ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we have measured @xmath14 and @xmath13s polarization for point sources , in order to examine the magnetic field structure .",
    "only the sources with photometric errors of @xmath190.1 mag and @xmath20 were used for analysis .",
    "figures [ f1]a and [ f2]a present the polarization degree versus the @xmath21s color for sources having polarization errors of @xmath22 at @xmath14 and @xmath13s , respectively . there is a tendency for the upper envelope of the plotted points to increase with @xmath21s , and the average polarization degree is slightly smaller at @xmath13s than at @xmath14 for the same @xmath21s color . these are consistent with the origin of the polarization being dichroic absorption .",
    "therefore , here we assume the polarization vectors as the directions of the local magnetic field average over the line of sight of the sources .",
    "these sources , except those of low @xmath21s colors , appear to have the maximum polarization efficiencies of @xmath23 - 0.2 ) = 6.6 $ ] and @xmath24 - 0.2)=4.4 $ ] , where we adopt @xmath25 as an offset of the intrinsic @xmath26 color , because the 2mass point sources with good photometric qualities are mostly located on the reddening belt that begins from the position of ( @xmath27 , @xmath21s)=(@xmath110.7 , @xmath110.2 ) on the @xmath27 versus @xmath21s diagram , within a @xmath28 area centered at serpens south .",
    "figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] present @xmath14 and @xmath13s - band polarization vectors of @xmath20 , excluding sources with polarizations larger than the above maximum polarization , superposed on 3@xmath03 mosaic @xmath14 and @xmath13s - band images , respectively . in general , the global magnetic field structures deduced from the @xmath14 and @xmath13s - band data seem to be the same . most of the vectors are roughly aligned with the ne - sw direction with the exception of those appearing in the ne and sw corners of the map .",
    "two distribution peaks are clearly seen in the histogram of the @xmath13s - band vector angles , although a sub - peak at @xmath14 can be barely seen ( figure [ f5 ] ) .",
    "our two - gaussian fit analysis for the @xmath13s - band vectors indicates that the mean angle of the main peak is @xmath29 with a standard deviation of @xmath30 and that the mean angle of the sub - peak is @xmath31 with a standard deviation of @xmath32 .",
    "the low number density of background stars toward the ne corner area suggests a molecular cloud or filament , other than the serpens south cloud , having a different magnetic field structure . on the other hand , toward the sw corner area , no clear signs of clouds",
    "are seen with high density of background stars . to investigate this",
    "further we examined the sources within a zone enclosed by the dotted lines toward the sw corner of the maps . unlike in the main filament , there is no tendency that the degree of polarization in this zone increases as an increase of @xmath21s color , and the degrees of polarization are relatively low with values @xmath333% at @xmath14 and @xmath332% at @xmath13s ( except a few sources ) in figures [ f1]b and [ f2]b .",
    "thus , the polarization in this sw area may not be dominated by the dichroic absorption of the serpens south cloud and is likely contaminated by either foreground or background interstellar polarization , although it could be also possible that the - line - of - sight component of the magnetic field is dominant toward the sw corner area .",
    "we apply a cut on the degree of polarization of at least 3% in @xmath34 and 2% in @xmath35 in order to insure that we are sampling the magnetic field associated with the dichroic absorption of the material in serpens south .",
    "figures [ f6 ] and [ f7 ] present the polarization vectors for the sources of @xmath36% and @xmath37% , resepctively , superposed on 1.1 mm dust continuum image @xcite , which was taken with the 144 pixel bolometer camera aztec @xcite mounted on the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) .",
    "figure [ f8 ] presents the schematic drawing of the filaments and the magnetic field directions toward the serpens south region .",
    "the illustrations of the filaments were deduced from this continuum image .",
    "the directions of the magnetic field were deduced from the the @xmath14-band polarization vectors in figure [ f6 ] .",
    "the 1.1 mm dust continuum image clearly shows a main filament that is elongated toward the nw and se directions from the central part of serpens south . along this main filament ,",
    "the magnetic field is roughly perpendicular to it , although some small deviation is seen .",
    "this ordered magnetic configuration suggests that the magnetic field is strong enough to regulate the whole structure of the main filament and , therefore , that the formation of the main filament has proceeded under the influence of the magnetic field .",
    "also the 1.1 mm dust continuum image shows sub - filaments that converge on the central part of the cluster or intersect the main filament ( figures [ f6 ] , [ f7 ] and [ f8 ] ) .",
    "these sub - filaments are also seen in the column density map of aquila @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the main filament , the magnetic field appears to be nearly parallel to the elongation directions of the sub - filaments , except in some parts of the sub - filaments .",
    "the southern sub - filament has a more complicated structure than a simple elongated structure and its global elongation seems parallel to the magnetic field , although some parts seem perpendicular or diagonal to the magnetic field .",
    "the east - southeast sub - filament is a long filament that stretches from the central part of the cluster toward the east - southeast direction , and appears to have some parts parallel to the magnetic field and some other parts diagonal to the magnetic field . near the convergent point on the main filament ,",
    "this ese sub - filament appears to change its elongation direction from the ese - wnw direction to the e - w direction and to split into a few , thinner filaments that are connected to the main filament ( see figure [ f9 ] , and also fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . toward this convergent point",
    ", the magnetic field also seems to be nearly perpendicular to the main filament just like the other sub - filaments .",
    "these suggest that all the sub - filaments intersect the main filament along the magnetic field , i.e. these sub - filaments could be outflows from the cluster or inflows toward the main filament .",
    "recent co ( 3 - 2 ) observations toward serpens south suggest that co ( 3 - 2 ) outflow lobes are anti - correlated with the sub - filaments @xcite , preferring the inflow view of the sub - filaments . in case of the inflows ,",
    "these sub - filaments could be important as mass supply agents of the cluster .",
    "looking at the overall magnetic field structure in the entire observed region , we can recognize that the magnetic field is curved toward the cluster , particularly in the southern area of the observed region ( figures [ f6 ] , [ f7 ] and [ f8 ] ) .",
    "although the origin of this large - scale curved magnetic field remains unclear , such morphology is consistent with the idea that the global magnetic field is distorted by gravitational contraction along the main filament toward the northern part of the main filament , which probably contains the majority of the mass in the serpens south cloud .",
    "however , we should wait for the detailed analysis of the dust continuum data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or molecular line data in order to know whether the northern part have enough mass to cause the large - scale curved magnetic field observed here .",
    "we roughly estimate the magnetic field strength toward two ( north , and south ) zones enclosed by dotted lines in figure [ f8 ] , where in the @xmath14-band polarization map ( figure [ f6 ] ) the local number density of the polarization vectors is relatively large and the polarization vectors seem to be locally well - ordered , using the chandrasekhar - fermi ( cf ) method @xcite . here",
    ", we calculate the plan - of - the - sky component of the magnetic field strength , @xmath38 , using the equation of the cf method ( e.g. , eq . 4 of * ?",
    "* ) and a correction factor , @xmath39 , for the cf method @xcite , where we adopt @xmath40 following @xcite . in this calculation , we use the @xmath14-band sources in figure [ f6 ] , due to the sample number larger than that of the @xmath13s - band sources in figure [ f7 ] .    for 21 sources toward the north zone , an average @xmath17 in p.a .",
    "is calculated to be 51.1@xmath419.6@xmath42 , and an average @xmath21s color to be 1.09@xmath430.15 mag . removing the dispersion due to the measurement uncertainty of the polarization angle of 4.7@xmath42",
    ", the intrinsic dispersion of the polarization angle ( @xmath44 ) of 8.4@xmath42 is obtained . from the average @xmath21s color",
    ", we estimate @xmath45 by adopting the color excess equation of @xmath21 color , @xmath46_{\\rm observed } - [ h - k]_{\\rm instrinsic}$ ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "here we adopted @xmath67260 pc , following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , they also mentioned the possibility of a larger distance up to 700 pc . in case of the larger distance , @xmath68 becomes smaller by a factor of @xmath69 in these estimates .",
    "the dynamical state of a magnetized cloud core is measured by the ratio between the cloud mass and the magnetic flux , i.e. , the mass - to - flux ratio , which is given by @xmath70 @xmath11 0.50.7 @xmath71 for these two zones , where @xmath72 is the critical value for a magnetic stability of the cloud ( = @xmath73 ; * ? ? ? * ) . here",
    ", we assumed that the magnetic field is almost perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "the estimated mass - to - flux ratios are close to the critical , implying that the magnetic field is likely to play an important role in the cloud dynamics and , thus , star formation significantly .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath13s - band polarization measurements of near - infrared point sources indicated a well - ordered global magnetic field that is nearly perpendicular to the main filament with a mean position angle of @xmath74 .",
    "this imply that the magnetic field is likely to have controlled the formation of the main filament . on the other hand , the sub - filaments , which converge on the central part of the cluster ,",
    "tend to run along the magnetic field , indicating a possibility that they are inflows or outflows along the magnetic field .",
    "the global magnetic field appears to be curved in the southern part of the observed region .",
    "this curved morphology suggests an idea that the global magnetic field is distorted by gravitational contraction along the main filament toward the northern part where the mass of the serpens south cloud seems to be mostly concentrated .",

    "the magnetic field strength is roughly estimated to be a few @xmath0100 @xmath1 g in two zones along the main filament .",
    "the mass - to - flux rations in these zones indicate that the filamentary cloud is close to magnetically critical as a whole .",
    "all the above results show that the magnetic field appears to significantly influence the dynamics of the serpens south cloud , which is associated with the cluster that is considered to be in the very early stage of cluster formation .",
