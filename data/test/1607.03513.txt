    "derived equivalences between finite dimensional algebras are known to be fundamental in representation theory and applications .",
    "unfortunately , still very few positive results are known about the structure of derived equivalences and about homological invariants .",
    "for instance , it is not known when ( a ) a derived equivalence between algebras @xmath0 and @xmath3 induces derived equivalences between certain centraliser subalgebras @xmath6 and @xmath7 , or in case of group algebras between subgroup algebras .",
    "it is also not known when ( b ) the existence of a derived equivalence implies that @xmath0 and @xmath3 share homological invariants such as global or dominant dimension . for known classes of derived equivalences ,",
    "both questions are known to have dauntingly negative answers .",
    "the aim of this article is to identify large classes of algebras where both problems do have positive solutions . a starting point , and some hope , may be provided by the class of self - injective algebras , which have both global and dominant dimension infinite , except in the semisimple case . under some mild assumption ,",
    "derived equivalences are known to preserve the property of being self - injective , hence also the values of these two homological dimensions . in full generality ,",
    "derived equivalences between self - injective algebras @xmath0 and @xmath3 induce stable equivalences of morita type and thus there are equalities between global and also between dominant dimensions of @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "this motivates considering algebras that are closely related to self - injective algebras and considering derived equivalences inducing stable equivalences of morita type , leading to the following more precise versions of ( a ) and ( b ) :    the key concept to address both questions and to identify suitable and interesting classes of algebras is @xmath1-dominant dimension ( to be defined in [ defn : strong dominant dimension ] ) , where @xmath1 is the nakayama functor sending projective to injective modules over an algebra .",
    "concerning ( a ) , an assumption is needed to identify unique and non - zero associated self - injective centraliser subalgebras ( first used by martinez - villa @xcite ) of @xmath0 and @xmath3 , respectively , which then can be investigated for derived equivalence . in general",
    ", it may happen that an algebra @xmath0 having zero as associated self - injective algebra is derived equivalent to an algebra @xmath3 having a non - zero associated self - injective algebra ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) for an example .",
    "the condition that both algebras have faithful strongly projective - injective modules allows to identify non - trivial associated self - injective centraliser subalgebras ( lemma [ lem : two dominant dimensions coincide ] and definition [ defn : associatedselfinjectivealgebra ] ) , and it is strong enough to solve problem ( a ) :    : _ let @xmath0 and @xmath3 be finite dimensional algebras of @xmath1-dominant dimension at least one , and let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be their associated self - injective centraliser subalgebras . if @xmath0 and @xmath3 are derived equivalent , then also @xmath2 and @xmath4 are derived equivalent . _    the proof is based on a stronger result ( theorem [ thm : restriction theorem ] ) , which shows that the given derived equivalence between @xmath0 and @xmath3 restricts to certain subcategories that are shown to determine the derived categories of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "the class of algebras of @xmath1-dominant dimension at least one contains all self - injective algebras , but also the morita algebras introduced in @xcite , which are characterised in ( theorem [ prop : characterise morita algebras ] ) as the algebras having @xmath1-dominant dimension at least two ; their @xmath1-dominant dimension coincides with the classical dominant dimension .",
    "morita algebras in turn contain gendo - symmetric algebras and hence several classes of algebras of interest in algebraic lie theory such as classical or quantised schur algebras and blocks of the bgg - category @xmath10 of semisimple complex lie algebras ; these algebras usually have finite global dimension , but are related to self - injective algebras by schur - weyl dualities",
    ". special cases of the derived restriction theorem state for instance : ( 1 ) two classical or quantised schur algebras @xmath11 ( with @xmath5 ) are derived equivalent only if the corresponding group algebras of symmetric groups or hecke algebras are so ( for the latter a derived equivalence classification is known by chuang and rouquier @xcite ) .",
    "+ ( 2 ) auslander algebras of self - injective algebras of finite representation type are derived equivalent if and only if the self - injective algebras are so ( the latter derived equivalences are known by work of asashiba @xcite ) , and in this case the auslander algebras moreover are stably equivalent of morita type ( corollary [ cor : restriction theorem for auslander algebras ] ) .",
    "problem ( b ) does not , in general , have a positive answer for algebras of @xmath1-dominant dimension at least one ; only upper bounds for the differences in dimensions can be given ( which are valid in general , proposition [ prop : bound global dimension ] and theorem [ thm : bound the difference ] ) .",
    "to identify subclasses of algebras where problem ( b ) has a positive answer , two approaches are developed here :    one approach identifies special derived equivalences , which do preserve both global and dominant dimensions : these are the ( iterated ) almost @xmath1-stable derived equivalences ( introduced in @xcite ) . these equivalences are known to induce stable equivalences of morita type .",
    "standard equivalences between self - injective algebras are of this form .",
    "the same is true for a larger class of algebras introduced here , the almost self - injective algebras , which include all self - injective algebras and also some algebras of finite global dimension , for instance schur algebras of finite representation type :    the second approach concentrates on directly identifying global and dominant dimension inside some derived category ; in the case of dominant dimension , the associated self - injective centraliser subalgebra occurring in the derived restriction theorem is used .",
    "this approach works ( under the assumption of having dominant dimension at least one ) for all split algebras ( e.g. , algebras over an algebraically closed field ) having an anti - automorphism ( for instance , a duality ) preserving simples :    dualities , i.e. involutory anti - automorphisms fixing simples , exist for instance for all cellular algebras .",
    "the second invariance theorem covers in particular classical and quantised schur algebras and even their blocks .",
    "in fact , the invariance property is strong enough ( theorems [ thm : global dimension of blocks of schur algebras ] and [ thm : dominant dimension of blocks of schur algebras ] ) to determine these dimensions by explicit combinatorial formulae in terms of weights and ( quantum ) characteristics , for all blocks of such schur algebras , using the derived equivalences constructed by chuang and rouquier .",
    "the main results of this article are motivated by various results in the literature , which are extended and applied here :    the idea to use schur - weyl dualities and schur functors to compare homological data of self - injective algebras such as group algebras of symmetric groups and of their schur algebras ( quasi - hereditary covers ) , of finite global dimension , has been developed in @xcite .",
    "there it has been demonstrated that dominant dimension is not only crucial for existence of schur - weyl duality , @xcite , but also for the quality of the schur functor in preserving homological data , although typically on one side of schur - weyl duality there is an algebra of infinite global and dominant dimension and on the other side there is an algebra with finite such dimensions .",
    "these are derived equivalent only in degenerate ( semisimple ) cases . the same approach has been demonstrated to work for hochschild cohomology in @xcite , where also a first instance of the derived restriction theorem has appeared .",
    "the concept of ( iterated ) almost @xmath1-stable derived equivalence and its useful properties have been developed in @xcite , where the focus has been on the resulting stable equivalences of morita type ( which imply invariance of global and dominant dimension ) .",
    "chuang and rouquier s derived equivalence classification of blocks of symmetric groups and of some related algebras provides an important supply of examples .",
    "it turns out , however , that already these equivalences , more precisely those between quantised schur algebras , are not always iterated @xmath1-stable , which forces us to use the second approach to derived invariants , using anti - automorphisms fixing simples , in this case .",
    "after recalling two major homological invariants of algebras , global dimension and dominant dimension , a new variation of dominant dimension , @xmath1-dominant dimension , is introduced that will turn out to provide a crucial assumption in the main results . in the second subsection , the two main classes of algebras considered here will be discussed and related to @xmath1-dominant dimension ; these are the morita algebras , which will get characterised in terms of @xmath1-dominant dimension , and the new class of almost self - injective algebras .      throughout",

    "the following result implies a particular property of the cover ; each block of @xmath844 is a quasi - hereditary cover of the corresponding block of @xmath835 , of the same dominant dimension .",
    "this property may be formulated as saying that the covering is uniform of covering degree @xmath897 .      if @xmath887 , then @xmath871 is semisimple and has dominant dimension infinity .",

    "then the young module @xmath850 belongs to the block @xmath905 and by definition @xmath910 . as a result , by mackey s decomposition theorem @xmath911 here ,",
