    "in one dimension ( 1d ) the ground state of the heisenberg antiferromagnet may be quasi - ordered or disordered , depending on the spin parity s @xcite . when s is an integer , and in particular , when @xmath2 , the ground state corresponds to a magnetically disordered state where spin - spin correlation functions ( cfs ) exponentially decay with distance and with total spin @xmath4 .",
    "this state is called a quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) as the spin - spin cfs are equivalent to the density - density cfs in conventional liquids and because it has total spin @xmath3 and no broken symmetry .",
    "this concept can be generalized to classical systems if the spins are considered as @xmath5 vectors .",

    "naturally , frustrated structures may exist not only for @xmath6 and for over 50 years frustrated lattices have been examined in the search for disordered ground states in higher dimensions ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "one goal of this research into peculiar structures is the study of unconventionnal spectra , not covered by the lieb and mattis theorem @xcite . to date , two particular lattices have been considered as good candidates for spin liquid ground states : the kagom lattice and the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the first one is a two dimensional arrangement of corner sharing triangles , while the latter is a three dimensional structure of corner sharing tetrahedra .",

    "experimentally , all systems that can be well described by the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on these lattices have been found to possess this spin liquid behavior or unconvential behaviors that can be ascribed in part to the underlying `` theoretical '' spin liquid ground state @xcite .",
    "this suggests that both the elementary cells ( triangle or tetrahedron ) and the connectivity ( corner sharing ) are major ingredients for magnetic disorder . in this paper , we study such a lattice , where the elementary cell is a tetrahedron and where connectivity is corner sharing  :  the checkerboard lattice ( see fig .

    "this is exactly the same phenomenon that was previously observed on the kagom as well as on the pyrochlore lattice .",

[ phasediagram],width=291 ]    the second zone corresponds to the range @xmath87 . because of quantum corrections , local magnetization is renormalized to zero , which means that in this approximation , the system does not show magnetic ordering .",
    "even if quantum fluctuations drive the system to disorder , one notes that magnons are still dispersive .",
    "this means that there is no peculiar contribution coming from their structure .",
    "this is no longer the case for the special point @xmath43 . at this point , the lowest branch of spin waves is flat over the whole brillouin zone ( fig .",
    "[ magnons - dispersions ] bottom ) .",
    "this has several consequences .",
    "first , this means that at the level of this approximation , there will always be a critical coupling , whatever the value of the spin .",
    "this comes directly from the non - analytic behavior of @xmath88 when @xmath89 along directions @xmath90 .",
    "because of that the local magnetization diverges as @xmath91 , i.e is renormalized to zero , whatever the value of s. consequently , we obtain a phase diagram ( @xmath92,@xmath93 ) very similar to the one of the @xmath94 square lattice model where @xmath93 plays the role of @xmath95 ( see fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] and fig .  2 of ref .",
    "this problem of flat mode is often encountered in frustrated lattices and it rules out the possibility of studying the @xmath43 point without going to next order of expansion in our model , i.e , without including quartic terms .",
    "whether such an inclusion of quartic terms is relevant is not clear as it corresponds to consider quartic modes as perturbations of _ zero _ quadratic modes .",
    "nevertheless , it is the simplest next step to be done in the frame of spin wave ( holstein - primakoff ) analysis @xcite .",
    "second , it has a meaning very close to mf conclusions .",
    "if the lowest branch of magnons is flat , this means that the system has no spin stiffness .",
    "thus , any local deformation will not propagate through lattice .",
    "this is very close to the argument of continuous degeneracy obtained through the mf approach , i.e the existence of an infinite number of local degrees of freedom ( see eq . [ constraints ] ) .",
    "these degrees of freedom are one of the signatures of frustrated systems and may be counted , in the case of classical spins , through the `` maxwellian counting '' rule @xcite . at the level of the lsw approximation , this means that quantum fluctuations and geometrical frustration may destabilize the nel state for a finite range of @xmath17 .",
    "wether a quantum spin liquid ground state in this range is stable is beyond this approach even if the existence of critical couplings goes in the right direction .",
    "we now turn to the dyson - maleev approach . as for the preceding case ,",
    "the local magnetization has been computed for different value of the spin .",
    "the main result is that for all @xmath96 , there is no critical coupling , i.e the local magnetization of the nel state is always finite in the isotropic limit @xmath97 .",

    "the local magnetization is finite , suggesting that the ground state could be the nel state . for @xmath76 , the local magnetization",
    "is renormalized to zero by quantum fluctuations .",

    "[ dysondispersion ] ) .",
    "case in the limit @xmath89 .",
    "the dispersions are no longer pathological as they are in the lsw approximation and the flat mode is destroyed .",
    "this clearly indicates that destabilization of the nel state is driven here only by quantum fluctuations .",
    "[ dysondispersion],width=302 ]    from the structure of the bosons excitations , it is clear that including quantum fluctuations via the dyson - maleev formalism destroys the pathological structure of the flat mode .",
    "therefore , destabilization of the nel state is only driven by quantum fluctuations within this approximation and not by a zero spin stiffness as it was the case in the lsw approximation in the limit @xmath89 .",
    "these results are quite surprising as they are qualitatively different from the lsw approximation .",
    "this suggests that the more accurately the quantum fluctuations are taken into account , the more the nel state is stable , even in the isotropic limit .",
    "this is unexpected as the checkerboard antiferromagnet was expected to behave like the kagom antiferromagnet . in the latter case",
    ", the reduction of the local magnetization to zero by quantum fluctuations and geometry , within a finite range of couplings , has been shown using two distinct numerical methods @xcite .",
    "it was found that going from the triangular limit to the kagom limit , there is a singular point associated to a critical coupling ( @xmath101 ) , where local magnetization vanishes .",
    "here , we obtain the same conclusion within the lsw approximation but not within the mean field treatment of the dyson - maleev approach .",
    "wether this discrepency comes from the quantum fluctuation that are better incorporated in the latter formalism , or comes from the mean field treatment of the dm representation is not clear .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to note that a recent work @xcite shows the same tendency , i.e a transition from an @xmath3 ground state to a stable nel state with increasing spin size @xmath0 .",
    "if the present calculations treats correctly quantum fluctuations ( which is not proven in this paper ) , the frontier between the expected vbs state and the nel ordering @xcite would then be at @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , it should be stressed that the present work does not test wether other classical ground states could be stable at the isotropic point and have the same or a different energy then the nel ground state .",
    "consequently , an intrinsic or accidental degeneracy of magnetic ground states for @xmath96 is not ruled out by this approach .",
    "as shown in the preceding sections , it seems that only for @xmath76 can the ground state be non - magnetic . to shed light on the behavior of the @xmath76 checkerboard antiferromagnet , it is possible to use a `` fermionic '' su(n ) generalization of the su(2 ) group [ note that @xmath102 does not correspond to a higher spin representation of su(2 ) .",
    "therefore , a mean - field solution of the su(n ) hamiltonian is expected to be much closer to the su(2 ) physics than the classical description of sec .",
    "[ sw - hamiltonian ] ] .",
    "this formalism has been previously introduced by marston and affleck @xcite and applied to the square antiferromagnet .",
    "the advantage of this description is that it works on all lattices , even frustrated @xcite or not bipartite , and that it is well suited for the checkerboard antiferromagnet as spin order never occurs in the exactly solvable large - n limit @xcite , as it is expected in the range @xmath103 for @xmath104 . at large n",

    "the @xmath108 variables may be seen as valence bond operators @xcite as @xmath109 is the number of valence bonds on the link @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , in this formalism , every ground state is described by a map of these complex scalar fields .",
    "several authors have concentrated on the mean - field solutions ( `` @xmath111 '' ) @xcite and in particular , it is possible to apply here a theorem established by d. rokhsar @xcite .",
    "first it is clear that the checkerboard antiferromagnet is `` dimerizeable with respect to @xmath16 '' as `` it is possible to partition the network into disjoint pairs of sites such that ( a ) every site belongs to one and only one pair , and ( b ) for each pair ( i , j ) whe have @xmath112 '' . in the range",

    "[ large - n - solutions ] ) .",
    "taking now into account the @xmath17 couplings , only one of these phases survives , where @xmath17 links are not frustrated .",
    "at this point , it means that _ if _ the su(n ) description of the su(2 ) case is relevant , it suggests that for @xmath76 , in the range @xmath103 , the ground state should be two times degenerate ( because there are two choices for the tiling ) , consisting in a valence bond solid of disconnected squares without crossings ( in the range @xmath121 it is clear that this formalism is not relevant as the local magnetisation is finite ) .",
