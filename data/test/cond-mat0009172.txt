    "once fluidized a vibrated granular medium looks like a gas of particles that can be described using kinetic theory of usual gases . however , granular gases basically differ from ordinary ones mostly due to the inelasticity of collisions , i.e. , nonconservation of energy .",
    "while over the years many attempts based on kinetic theory @xcite have been made to describe such dissipative granular gases , no agreement has been found so far both with experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite , for the dependence of the granular temperature , i.e. , the mean kinetic energy per particle , on the parameters of vibration @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study is to guess possible gas - like state equations for such a dissipative granular gas and to observe new kinetic behaviors which trace back to the inelasticity of collisions , e.g. , the tendency of such media to form clusters .",
    "although this feature has probably been known since the early observation of planetary rings @xcite and although various cluster types in granular flows have been observed numerically @xcite , there exist only a few recent laboratory experiments .",
    "one experiment , with a horizontally shaken 2d layer of particles , displayed a cluster formation , but the coherent friction force acting on all the particles was far from being negligible @xcite .",
    "we performed a similar experiment by exciting a 3d granular medium with a vertically vibrated piston .",
    "we did observe clustering , but we could not rule out a lock - in mechanism involving the time scale connected with gravity and the period of vibration @xcite .",
    "we thus repeated this experiment in a low - gravity environment , where inelastic collisions were the only interaction mechanism , and observed a motionless dense cluster that confirms that the inelasticity of collisions alone can generate clustering @xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to the study of the low - density situation , where clustering does not occur .",
    "it is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the presentation of our experimental setup .",
    "the experimental results are presented in secs .",
    "we report in sec . 3 ( resp .",
    "4 ) the measurements of pressure ( resp .",
    "volume ) of a gas of spherical particles excited by a vibrating piston and undergoing inelastic collisions . at constant external driving ,",
    "we show that the pressure passes through a maximum for a critical number of particles before decreasing for large @xmath0 .",
    "the density of particles as a function of the altitude is studied in sec . 5 , where we observe an exponential atmosphere far enough from the piston .",
    "from measurements of secs . 35 , we show in sec . 6 that the dependence of the granular temperature , @xmath1 , on the piston velocity , @xmath2 , is of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a decreasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in the light of previous works @xcite and give our conclusions in sec . 7 .",
    "the experiment consists of a transparent cylindrical tube , with an inner diameter of @xmath5  mm , filled from @xmath6 up to @xmath7 stainless steel spheres , @xmath8  mm in diameter , roughly corresponding to @xmath9 up to about @xmath10 particle layers at rest .",
    "an electrical motor , with eccentric transformer from rotational to translational motion , drives the particles sinusoidally with a @xmath11 or @xmath12 mm amplitude , @xmath13 , in the frequency range from @xmath14 to @xmath6 hz . a lid in the upper part of the cylinder ,",
    "is either fixed at a given height , @xmath15 ( constant  volume experiment ) or is mobile and stabilized at a given height @xmath16 due to the bead collisions ( constant  pressure experiment ) .",
    "the heights @xmath15 and @xmath16 are defined from the lower piston at full stroke .",
    "when the vibration is strong enough and the number of particles is low enough , the particles display ballistic motion between successive collisions like molecules in a gas ( see fig .  [ fig01]a ) . when the density of the medium is increased , the gaslike state is no longer stable but displays the formation of a dense cluster bouncing like a nearly solid body ( see fig .  [",
    "fig01]b ) .",
    "this paper is devoted to the study of the gaslike state .",
    "its aim is to determine experimentally a state equation  between pressure , volume , particle number and the vibration parameters ( amplitude and frequency ) .    ;",

    "as a function of @xmath0 . from the lower ( @xmath23marks ) to the upper ( hexagrams ) curve , vibration frequency @xmath24 varies from @xmath25 to @xmath6  hz with a @xmath18  hz step .",
    "for all these experiments , @xmath26 mm and @xmath27  mm , @xmath28 being the bed height at rest",
    ". one single layer of particles at rest corresponds to @xmath29 .",
    "lines join the data points ]    time averaged pressure measurements have been performed as follows . initially , a counterwheight of mass @xmath30  g balances the lid mass .",
    "the piston drives stainless steel spheres in erratic motions in all directions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig01]a ) .",
    "particles are hitting the lid all the time , so that to keep it at a given height @xmath15 we have to hold the lid down by a given force , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the mass of a weight we place on the lid and @xmath33 the acceleration of gravity . at a fixed @xmath15 , _ i.e. _ at a constant  volume , fig .  [ fig02 ]",
    "shows the time averaged pressure @xmath34 exerted on the lid as a function of the number @xmath0 of beads in the container , for different frequencies of vibration , @xmath35 being the area of the tube cross - section . at constant external driving , _",
    "i.e. _ at fixed @xmath24 and @xmath13 , the pressure passes through a maximum for a critical value of @xmath0 roughly corresponding to @xmath36 particle layers at rest .",
    "this critical number is independent of the vibration frequency .",
    "a further increase of the number of particles leads to a decrease in the mean pressure since more and more energy is dissipated by inelastic collisions .",
    "note that gravity has a small effect in these measurements that are performed for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the maximum velocity of the piston .",
    "for @xmath0 such that one has less than one particle layer at rest , most particles perform vertical ballistic motion between the piston and the lid .",
    "thus , the mean pressure increases roughly proportionally to @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 is increased such that one has more than one particle layer at rest , interparticle collisions become more frequent .",
    "the energy dissipation is increased and thus the pressure decreases .",
    ", as a function of @xmath0 , for various frequencies @xmath24 of vibration . from the lower ( @xmath39marks ) to the upper ( @xmath40marks )",

    "one single layer of particles at rest corresponds to @xmath29 .",
    "lines join the data points ]",
    "we now consider the bed expansion under the influence of collisions on a circular wire mesh lid placed on top of the beads leaving a clearance of about 0.5 mm between the edge of the lid and the tube . due to the bead collisions ,",
    "the lid is stabilized at a given height @xmath16 from the piston at full stroke .",
    "although the lid mass is roughly @xmath42 times smaller than the total mass of the beads , the lid proves to be quite stable and remains horizontal .",
    "the expansion , @xmath43 , of the bed is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] as a function of @xmath0 for different vibration frequencies .",
    "@xmath28 is the bed height at rest . at fixed @xmath24 ,",
    "the expansion passes through a maximum for a critical value of @xmath0 roughly corresponding to @xmath44 particle layers at rest .",
    "this critical number is independent of the vibration frequency .",
    "when @xmath0 is further increased , the expansion decreases showing , as for pressure measurements , an increase in dissipated energy by inelastic collisions .",
    "note that the height @xmath16 of the granular gas is much larger than for the pressure measurements of fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] . consequently , gravity is important here .",
    "as already found experimentally in 1d @xcite and 3d @xcite and numerically @xcite , we observe that , at @xmath0 fixed , the granular medium exhibits ( see fig .  [ fig04]a ) a sudden expansion at a critical frequency corresponding to a bifurcation similar to that exhibited by a single ball bouncing on a vibrating plate @xcite .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig04]a shows that this critical frequency depends on the number of layers , @xmath45 .",
    "when @xmath45 increases above 0.4 , a transition from the 1d  like behavior to a 3d one is observed : the expansion at the critical frequency becomes less abrupt and tends to increase regularly with @xmath24 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig04]a  b ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the aim of this study was an experimental determination of the state equation of dissipative granular gases .",
    "it is known that for a fixed number of granular layers at rest , one has in the low - density limit @xmath46 @xcite , where @xmath47 is the mean pressure , @xmath48 the volume and @xmath1 the granular temperature . however , the dependence of @xmath1 on the vibration amplitude , @xmath13 , and frequency , @xmath24 , of the piston and on the number of particles , @xmath45 , is still a matter of debate @xcite . kinetic theory @xcite or hydrodynamic models @xcite show @xmath49 , whereas numerical simulations @xcite or experiments @xcite give @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath38 is the maximum velocity of the piston .",
    "these previous conflicting results may be explained by the @xmath2dependence of @xmath1 that we have found from our measurements : @xmath53 , with @xmath4 continuously varying from @xmath54 when @xmath55 , as expected from kinetic theory , to @xmath56 for large @xmath45 .",
    "we emphasize that we have only considered the dependence of the granular temperature on the vibration velocity @xmath2 .",
    "for the dependence on the number of particles , another term of the form @xmath57 should exist , that we can not determine from these measurements .",
