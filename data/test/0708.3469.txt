    "self - assembled semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) have attracted a large interest because the discrete and isolated energy levels due to the 3d confinement can be utilized in high - efficiency and low - threshold current lasers,@xcite single photon emitters@xcite and in quantum computing applications ( qubits ) .",
    "@xcite 1.3 @xmath3 m optical devices have been achieved using inas / gaas quantum dots,@xcite however , it is difficult to push further the inas / gaas qd devices to work at the more desirable @xmath21.55@xmath3 m telecommunication wavelength because the large compressive strain ( 7% ) in the inas / gaas dots enlarges the conduction - valence energy gap of inas too much for this purpose .",
    "intuitively , a inas dot embedded in a less lattice mismatched host material , e.g. inp , should solve the problem . indeed ,",
    "recently there have been reports on 1.55 @xmath3 m inas / inp qds lasers with a high - gain and a low - threshold current,@xcite which opens up the possibility to integrate quantum dot material into an optical cavity@xcite and hence to reliably fabricate a single photon source in the telecommunications wavelength range.@xcite    despite their importance , there are only few studies on the inas / inp system , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite compared to the well studied inas / gaas qds .",
    "although the inas / inp dots and the inas / gaas dots have the same dot material , they differ in three aspects , ( i ) inas / inp has a much smaller lattice mismatch ( 3% ) than inas / gaas ( 7% ) .",
    "( ii ) the inas / inp dots have a less confining potential for electrons , but a stronger confinement for holes than the inas / gaas dots .",
    "( iii ) the inas / inp dots share the same cation ( in ) , while the inas / gaas qds share the same anion ( as ) at the interface .",
    "these differences may lead to different electronic and optical properties of the two systems .",
    "the continuum theories , such as those based on the effective mass approximation ( ema ) and multi - bands @xmath7 method , may in principle capture the first two differences , however , to account for the third aspect , one needs atomistic theories such as the empirical pseudopotential methods @xcite or the tight - binding methods.@xcite the empirical pseudopotential methods have been successfully applied to various systems .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we perform a comparative study on the inas / inp qds and inas / gaas qds using an atomistic pseudopotential method .",
    "we find that there are significant differences in the electronic structure between the two systems , including the single - particle energy levels and optical properties .",
    "these differences , which have not yet been paid enough attention to , could be revealed in the future high - resolution optical spectroscopy @xcite and charging experiments .",
    "@xcite    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we introduce briefly the atomistic pseudopotential method used in the calculations . in sec .",

    "the geometries of the qds studied here are lens - shaped inas dots embedded in the host materials ( gaas or inp ) matrices containing 60 @xmath8 60@xmath8 60 8-atom unit cells .",
    "the dots are assumed to grow along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "we performed the calculations on dots with base diameters @xmath5= 20 , and 25 nm , and for each base diameter , we vary the dot heights @xmath9 from 2.5 nm to 5.5 nm , as the dot height is relatively easy to control in experiments.@xcite we first relax the dot+matrix system by minimizing the strain energy as a function of the coordinate @xmath10 of atom @xmath11 at site @xmath12 for all atoms , using valence force field ( vff ) methods.@xcite once we have the atom positions , we obtain the energy levels and wavefunctions by solving the single - particle schrdinger equation ,",

    "the pseudopotentials of inas / inp dots are given in appendix [ sec : epm ] , whereas the potentials for inas / gaas qds are taken from ref .  .",
    "the schrdinger eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) is solved by expanding the wavefunctions @xmath17 as linear combinations of bulk bands ( lcbb )  @xcite @xmath18 of band index @xmath19 and wave vector @xmath20 of material @xmath21 (= inas , gaas , inp ) , strained uniformly to strain @xmath22 .",
    "we use @xmath23 for the hole states , and @xmath24 for electron states on a 6@xmath86@xmath816 k - mesh .",
    "we use @xmath25 for the matrix material , and an average @xmath22 value from vff for the strained dot material ( inas ) .",
    "it has been shown that the energy levels changes in inas / gaas qds due to the piezoelectric effects are quite small .",
    "@xcite because the lattice mismatch in the inas / inp qds is only half of that of the inas / gaas qds , we expect that the piezo - effect should be even smaller in the inas / inp dots , and therefore is ignored in the present calculations .",
    "the exciton energies are calculated using the configuration interaction ( ci ) method following ref . .",
    "we first compare the strain profiles in the inas / gaas and the inas / inp qds .",
    "figure [ fig : strain_gaas ] ( a ) , ( b ) depict the hydrostatic and biaxial strain along the [ 100 ] direction and the [ 001 ] direction respectively for the inas / gaas dot , whereas fig .",
    "[ fig : strain_inp ] ( a ) , ( b ) depict the strain profiles for the inas / inp quantum dots .",
    "the strain is calculated for the lens - shaped qds with @xmath5=25 nm , and @xmath9=3.5 nm .",
    "the hydrostatic(isotropic ) strain is defined as @xmath26 , reflecting the relative change of volume i.e. , @xmath27 , whereas the biaxial strain is defined as @xmath28 .",
    "as we can see , the hydrostatic strains of the inas / inp and inas / gaas dots have very similar features : both are almost constants inside the dots and decay rapidly to zero in the matrices .",
    "the hydrostatic strain is negative in both dots , suggesting that the inas dot is compressed .",
    "however , the hydrostatic strain in the inas / inp dot is about half of that in the inas / gaas dot .",
    "the biaxial strain of both qds also has similar features , decaying fast in the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions outside the dots , it has long tails along the [ 001 ] direction .    the hydrostatic strain and the biaxial strain will shift the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) and the valence band maximum ( vbm ) , and therefore modify the band - offsets of the qd .",
    "the biaxial strain will further split the heavy - hole ( hh ) and light - hole ( lh ) bands .",
    "we analyze the strain - modified band - offsets via pikus - bir model , @xcite using the local strain input from vff calculations .",
    "this model , however , serves only as an illustration of the strain effect and is not used in our actual calculation of the single particle energy levels .",
    "the strain modified band - offsets are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain_gaas ] ( c),(d ) for inas / gaas quantum dot , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain_inp ] ( c),(d ) for inas / inp quantum dot along the [ 100 ] direction and [ 001 ] direction respectively .",
    "the vbm of the unstrained host materials is set to be zero as the reference energy .",
    "the band - offsets in the inas / gaas dot are 480 mev for the electron and 280 mev for the hole , compared with 1050 mev for the electron and 46 mev for the hole in the unstrained system . @xcite the confinement potential for electrons is stronger than that for holes .",
    "in contrast , for the unstrained inas / inp system , the band - offset@xcite is 580 mev for the electron and 420 mev for the hole , which change to 320 mev and 530 mev respectively in the inas / inp qds , due to the strain effects .",
    "the confinement potential for holes is stronger than that for electrons.@xcite therefore , the confinement potentials in the inas / gaas and the inas / inp qds are very different .",
    "while the confinement for electrons is weaker in the inas / inp qds , the confinement for holes is significantly stronger .",
    "how the different confinement potentials lead to different electronic structure in the two dot systems will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : single - particle ] .",
    "it was pointed out in ref . that in the tall inas / gaas qd , the biaxial strain might develop hole traps that localize holes at the interface of the qds .",
    "this is unlikely to happen in the inas / inp qds for two reasons .",
    "( i ) the strain in the inas / inp qds is much smaller than in the inas / gaas qds .",
    "( ii ) the band - offset for holes in the inas / inp qds is much larger than in the inas / gaas qds .",
    "the biaxial strain splits the hh and lh bands in addition to shifting the vbm .",
    "hh is higher in energy than the lh band , i.e. , @xmath29 inside both dots .",
    "the hh - lh splitting is about 180 mev for the inas / gaas qd and 120 mev for the inas / inp qd . outside the qd , the heavy - light - hole splitting changes sign , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite it is also interesting to note that the so band inside the inas / gaas quantum dot is lower in energy than outside the qds , while the opposite is true for the inas / inp quantum dot , due to the large band - offsets between inas and inp for holes .",
    "in this section , we compare the pseudopotential calculated single - particle energy levels as well as the wavefunctions of the inas / inp qds to those of the inas / gaas qds . the energy levels are compared in three scales : ( i ) the energy difference between the lowest electron state and highest hole state , which largely determines the exciton energies and is in the order of 1 ev , ( ii ) the intraband energy spacing which is in the order of a few tens mev .",
    "( iii ) the intraband @xmath0 level splitting due to the c@xmath31 atomistic symmetry of the qds , which is in the order of a few mev .",
    "the single - particle energy levels of the inas / inp dots are summarized in table .",
    "[ tab : levelspacing ] , whereas the results for the inas / gaas dots can be found in table i of ref . .",
    "the results of the inas / gaas qds are very similar to what was obtained in ref . .",

    "[ fig : confiedstate](b ) the lowest 6 confined electron levels and the highest 6 confined hole levels of a inas / gaas qd of @xmath5=20 nm , @xmath9=2.5 nm . the zero energy is chosen to be the vbm of the host materials .",
    "the confined electron ( hole ) states are defined to be the states whose energies are lower ( higher ) than the cbm ( vbm ) of the host materials .",
    "we also show the electron and hole envelope wavefunctions of the inas / gaas and inas / inp qds for two dot geometries : a flat dot ( @xmath5=25 nm , @xmath9=2.5 nm ) in fig .",

    "the number on the bottom of each small panel gives the percentage of the density localized inside the qd .      as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : confiedstate ] , the inas / inp qds have fewer confined electron states compared to the inas / gaas qds due to the smaller conduction band offset . in the smaller",
    "inas / inp qd with @xmath5=20 nm , @xmath9=2.5 nm , only one electron state ( @xmath32 ) is confined .",

    "@xcite considering the next three levels , close in energy , the first two orbitals ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) that have similar shapes are @xmath1 orbitals , whereas the third orbital ( @xmath36 ) having a peak in the dot center , is the 2@xmath37 orbital .",
    "the wavefunctions of the inas / inp dots have very similar shapes to the corresponding ones of the inas / gaas dots , except that the wavefunctions of the inas / inp dots are larger , indicating that the electrons are less confined in the inas / inp dots . in the flat inas / inp qd ,",

    "qd .",
    "the valence band offset for the inas / inp qds is about 530 mev , which is almost twice as much as in the inas / gaas qds .",

    "the rotation of the @xmath0 orbitals has also been noticed by sheng et al.,@xcite and was attributed to the piezoelectric effects .",
