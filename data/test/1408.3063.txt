    "stars form in dense and cool molecular clouds .",
    "when the local density is high enough , the matter can gravitationally collapse and form a young stellar object ( yso ) . in the early phases , the thick envelope dominates the emission from the yso and hides what is going on within ( class  i ) .",
    "eventually , the envelope flattens out to a circumstellar accretion disk .",
    "this disk still causes an infrared ( ir ) excess above the level of a stellar photosphere ( class  ii or classical t tauri star - ctts ) , which can be used to distinguish those objects from main - sequence stars , for example using the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite infrared array camera ( irac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when the disk is cleared , the ir colors of the yso match those of main - sequence stars ( class  iii or weak - lined t tauri star - wtts ) .",
    "in addition to the circumstellar absorption , many ysos are embedded in the molecular cloud , so that even class  iii objects can appear reddened .",
    "the accretion disk does not reach down to the central star . instead",
    ", the inner edge of the gas disk is truncated by the stellar magnetic field .",
    "the inner radius of the optically thick dust in the disk is larger than the inner radius of the gas disk and mostly given by the dust - sublimation temperature .",
    "some of the mass in the circumstellar disk condenses into planets , some is blown out by accretion - driven disk and stellar winds , and is accreted onto the central star .",
    "this accretion can happen via magnetically confined accretion funnels ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or via some magneto - hydrodynamical instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "t  tauri stars ( tts ) were originally identified by their variability @xcite  long before anybody realized that tts are indeed pre - main sequence stars .",
    "the dominant timescale in the optical is the stellar rotation period , typically a few days to a week or more .",
    "ysos can have cool spots caused by magnetic activity similar to our sun and also hot spots which mark the impact points of the accretion funnels onto the stellar surface ( see , e.g. , review by * ? ? ?",
    "this impact happens at free - fall velocities up to 500  km  s@xmath1 ; thus , the accretion shock heats the accreted mass to x - ray emitting temperatures . in the optical",
    ", the accretion region appears as emission that often is approximated as a blackbody with temperature @xmath2  k ( @xcite , but see also @xcite who argue that line emission contributes to the veiling in addition to a continuum ) .",
    "variability in the mass accretion rate can lead to changes in the hot spot signatures .",
    "the dynamical timescale that controls the accretion is the keplerian period of the inner disk where the accretion funnels start .",
    "the inner disk radius is found close to the co - rotation radius leading to a typical timescale of a few hours for typical masses and rotation periods of ysos . indeed optical variability with amplitudes around 0.1  mag",
    "is often observed in ctts on this timescale @xcite .",
    "another source of variability related to the accretion could be oscillations of the accretion shock on timescales of seconds .",
    "this has been predicted theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is not observed so far , possibly because the accretion spot separates into many small funnels that oscillate independently at different phases and frequencies .",
    "however , @xcite find indications that strong accretion in v1647  ori could excite radial pulsations of the star itself .",
    "one of the largest classes of short timescale ( @xmath3 days ) optical and ir variability in ysos is that due to variable extinction events @xcite .",
    "these come in three categories - aa tau - type variables ( stars with broad , periodic flux dips , whose amplitudes can be up to a magnitude or more in the optical ) , presumably due to our line of sight passing through a warp in the inner circumstellar disk ; stars with similar or narrower flux dips that have no obvious periodicity - presumably due to stars where our line of sight passes close to the disk and where disk instabilities can levitate dust high enough above the plane to intersect our line of sight briefly ; and stars with narrow , periodic flux dips - perhaps where our line of sight is being intersected by dust entrained in material accreting onto the star in a funnel flow . about 20% of the ysos in ngc  2264 fall into one of these categories in the sample of @xcite .",
    "ysos can also vary on much longer timescales .",
    "variability on the timescales of years could be caused by changing circumstellar extinction for a keplarian disk around a solar - mass yso this timescale translates to a radius of a few au ) or by massive accretion events when a significant fraction of the disk mass drains onto the yso @xcite . in this case",
    "the accretion luminosity can outshine the yso by orders of magnitudes and it takes months to years ( in the case of exor outbursts , * ? ? ? * ) or even centuries until the accretion decays back down to the original level .",
    "in any lightcurve , several of the processes dicussed above can contibute to the observed variability at the same time and it depends on the properties of each object which one dominates and if secondary effects can be detected in the lightcurve .",
    "for example , cool spots , hot spots , absorption , and massive accretion events can all influence the same optical light curve .",
    "another case are x - rays , where the flux and the spectrum can change due to periodic absorption , variability in the accretion rate ( tw  hya , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or coronal activity similar to what is seen on the sun . in most ysos ,",
    "the last point is dominant and x - ray lightcurves often show the fast rise in flux and temperature and a slower decay characteristic of coronal activity ( see , e.g. , the _ chandra _ monitoring of the orion nebular cluster , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ysos in the optical is dominated by the stellar photosphere and the accretion spot .",
    "thus , optical monitoring is very effective for understanding the stellar rotation and the accreting spot .",
    "however , the disk radiates mostly at longer wavelengths , which are probed in the ir observations presented in this article .",
    "depending on the mass of the disk and the size of the inner hole , the disk will start to dominate the sed at the @xmath4 band or in the irac bands at @xmath5 m and @xmath6 m .",
    "simple disk models still treat the disk as a static and axisymmetric structure , but observationally it now seems that the disk is in fact `` a bubbling , boiling , wrinkled , dented , warped mass of gas and dust '' @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "this paper is part of the ysovar ( young stellar object variability ) project , which has monitored the ( onc ) and eleven smaller star forming regions with irac in @xmath5 m and @xmath6 m to understand the mid - ir variability of ysos .",
    "first results on the onc are published in @xcite .",
    "more details of the observing strategy and an overview of the data can be found in @xcite ( from now on `` paper  i '' ) . comparing data from all clusters , paper",
    "i defines certain cut - off values for the data reduction , e.g.  how much variability in a lightcurve is required to reliably identify an object as variable . in the analysis ,",
    "paper  i concentrates on variability in the ir on timescales of years . in this article",
    ", we present a _ spitzer_/irac monitoring campaign of the star forming region l1688 in the mid - ir to characterize the variability timescales and amplitudes as well as the color changes in the mid - ir in much more detail for the objects in l1688 than paper",
    "i on timescales up to two years .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : first , we introduce l1688 , the star forming region targeted by these observations ( section  [ sect : thestarformingregionl1688 ] ) . in section  [",
    "sect : observationsdatareductionandauxiliarydata ] we introduce the data reduction and discuss source lists and stellar properties obtained from the literature .",
    "section  [ sect : midirvariability ] classifies all sources according to their variability .",
    "section  [ sect : resultsanddiscussion ] presents our results and discusses physical models to explain the observed features in the lightcurves .",
    "we end with a summary and some conclusions in section  [ sect : summary ] .",
    "lynds  1688 ( l1688 ) is a sub - cloud of the @xmath7  ophiuchus star forming region , one of the best - studied young clusters in the sky ( see e.g.  review by * ? ? ?",
    "the central region of l1688 is very dense and deeply embedded ( @xmath8  mag , see figure  [ fig : map ] ) .",
    "thus , all surveys of the regions necessarily miss some cluster members .",
    "an extinction limited , spectroscopic survey @xcite finds an average age of 3.1  myr for a 6.8  pc@xmath9 region centered on l1688 and no significant deviation from the initial mass function .",
    "earlier studies concentrated on the deeper embedded core and found a much younger age of 0.3  myr .",
    "some , but not all , of this difference is due to the specific reddening laws or pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks used in these studies ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite present photometric and spectroscopic monitoring for five ysos in l1688 nearly simultaneous with the _ spitzer _ observations discussed here .",
    "they do not see any correlation between the hydrogen emission lines that are usually considered accretion indicators and the features in the ir lightcurves of their targets , indicating that the relatively modest variability they observed is not caused by changes in the accretion rate .",
    "additional notable objects with well - sampled nir lightcurves are @xcite and , which show eclipses with periods of 131 and 93  days , respectively . these sources can be interpreted as multiple systems , where one or more components are eclipsed by a warped circumstellar disk .",
    "thus far , the most comprehensive study of near - ir variability of ysos in l1688 is @xcite ( see references therein for other ir variability studies ) , who make use of a two micron all sky survey ( 2mass * ? ? ?",
    "* ) calibration field that overlaps l1688 so each source has up to 1584 datapoints in @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath4 spanning 2.5  years .",
    "they find 79% of the known ysos to be variable . in total ,",
    "32 sources are periodic ( including cool starspots , hot accretion spots and 6 systems with eclipses ) , 31 sources show a long - term trend and 40 sources vary aperiodically on shorter timescales .",
    "the new data presented in this article complements the @xcite study with observations at longer wavelengths .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the data reduction for the _ spitzer _ and _ chandra _ observations .",
    "a detailed account of the observations , data processing and the source extraction is given in paper  i. we also give an overview of auxiliary data on the stellar properties retrieved from the literature , which we need to test if the variability characteristics depend on the central star .",
    "we then assess the cluster membership and sed class for every source with a usable lightcurve .",

    ", we search for artifacts that are related to the position on the detector . compared with other clusters in the ysovar project",
    ", l1688 is particularly suited to discover these kinds of effects because the fields observed in l1688 have almost no rotation within one visibility window .",
    "the spacecraft orientation flips between visibility windows , so that most instrumental artifacts produce lightcurves that have one level in visibility window 1 and 3 and another level in visibility window 2 and 4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : instrumentallcs ] shows sources with a magnitude between 8 and 15 in @xmath6 m , that might fall in this category .",
    "the relative difference in magnitude is smaller for brighter sources , but since the photometric errors are also smaller these instrumental effects can still be significant .",
    "we visually inspected every frame for a sample of sources with lightcurves similar to those in figure  [ fig : instrumentallcs ] to identify the cause for the artifacts .",
    "we found that several different effects can cause these steps in the lightcurve .",
    "some sources are close to a detector edge , such that the background is not well - determined , some are in the wings of the point - spread function ( psf ) of a bright neighbor , and some show residuals from hot pixels .",
    "proximity to a detector edge or hot pixel affects only one of the spacecraft orientations ; even the psf wings change with the orientation since the psf is not circular .",
    "sufficiently strong intrinsic variability can mask this offset between visibility windows and for any individual source , this instrumental effect can not be distinguished from intrinsic variability with a period of one year .",
    "thus , we use a statistical approach to quantify the number of lightcurves that suffer from this problem . for each channel",
    ", we have about 200 lightcurves with datapoints in all four observing visibility windows ( the total number of lightcurves is larger , but only for sources in the three target fields do we have data for all four visibility windows ) .",
    "if the mean magnitude in a visibility window depends on the detector position of the source , this source will on average be brighter in visibility window 1 and 3 and fainter in visibility window 2 and 4 ( or vice - versa ) .",
    "we calculate the mean magnitude in each visibility window and test whether the two brightest mean magnitudes belong to visibility window [ 1,3 ] or [ 2,4 ] or any other combination ( [ 1,2 ] , [ 1,4 ] , [ 2,3 ] , [ 3,4 ] ) .",
    "we use the following abbreviated notation : when we calculate the mean magnitudes in each visibility window for a sample of @xmath15 sources , then @xmath16:@xmath17:@xmath18 means that @xmath16 sources have the brightest mean magnitudes in visibility windows [ 1,3 ] , @xmath17 sources in visibility windows [ 2,4 ] and @xmath18 sources have their two brightest mean magnitudes in any other combination of visibility windows .",
    "if the difference in the mean magnitude between visibility windows is unrelated to the position on the detector , we expect the ratio @xmath1917%:17%:67% .",
    "in contrast , the observed lightcurves have the ratio 47:66:75=25%:35%:40% for irac  1 and 52:59:95=25%:29%:46% for irac  2 .",
    "this is incompatible with the expected multinomial distribution ( the probability to observe a distribution at least as far from the expected @xmath20 by chance is @xmath21 ) . in each case , about 50 lightcurves , a quarter of the sample , need to be shifted from the first two bins to the last bin to make the observed distribution compatible with the expected distribution .",
    "this implies that about a quarter of all lightcurves suffer from the artifacts described above .",
    "however , both irac channels use independent detectors and thus the chance that both channels are affected for the same source and that the effect goes the same way ( bright - faint , vs. faint - bright ) is low .    below in section",
    "[ sect : midirvariability ] we identify variable sources using a stetson and a @xmath22 test .",
    "the limits in those tests are designed to be conservative and indeed we find a distribution of 5:7:24=14%:19%:67% for irac  1 and 5:5:27=14%:14%:73% for irac  2 , when we restrict the sample to those lightcurves that will be classified as variable below .",
    "both ratios are fully compatible with the expected multinomial distribution @xmath20 .",
    "this shows that the limits we apply are conservative enough that the sample of stars we identify as variable has no or only few sources where the variability is not due to intrinsic source variability .",
    "therefore it is not necessary to remove any source based on magnitude jumps between visibility windows .",
    "only one of the four lightcurves shown in figure  [ fig : instrumentallcs ] ( sstysv j162727.53 - 242611.2 ) will be identified as variable below .",
    "we visually inspected all lightcurves that are marked as variable and , apart form the example shown above , we did not see lightcurves where the variability seems to be due to the pattern discussed in this section .    in summary ,",
    "about a quarter of all lightcurves are affected by detector position dependent artifacts . in extreme cases ,",
    "the associated jumps reach 0.5  mag for a 14  mag source , and up to 0.05  mag in bright sources around 8  mag .",
    "however , we show statistically that the definition of variability we use is so conservative that this effect does not contribute a significant number of objects to our sample of variable sources .",
    "disk - bearing ysos can be identified from _ spitzer _",
    "data alone , but information in other spectral bands is required to find the other cluster members .",
    "x - ray observations are one way to identify diskless ( class  iii ) ysos . in the ir",

    "five acis chips were operational , four from the central acis - i imaging array , as well as one acis - s chip .",

    "the observed _ chandra _ field overlaps about two thirds of the area covered in the _ spitzer _ monitoring .",
    "however , the variable psf leads to a sensitivity that varies over the observed field , thus the absence of an x - ray detection for _ spitzer _ sources does not necessarily imply the absence of x - ray emission .",
    "the acis detector has an intrinsic energy resolution , and we use the net flux to characterize the x - ray properties . for sources with more than 20 counts , we also fit an absorbed single - temperature apec model @xcite with abundances fixed at 0.3 times the solar value from @xcite .",

    "a significantly reddened main - sequence star , which has an intrinsic slope @xmath48 , may appear as class  ii object , so this observational classification can not be translated directly into the evolutionary stage of an object . of the remaining sources we find 110 class  i , 78 flat - spectrum and 455 class  ii sources and 221 class  iii candidates .",
    "we can not classify 20 sources , because they are seen in one band only .    not only the evolutionary status but also other properties of the individual source such as inclination or stellar mass influence the value of @xmath23 .",
    "massive stars emit more energetic radiation and can thus change the structure of the accretion disk .",
    "however , l1688 is a region without massive ysos @xcite and we define @xmath23 using wavelengths longward of the @xmath31 band far from the peak of the stellar sed , so the shape of the photospheric sed has only negligible influence on the total sed .",
    "@xcite simulated different ysos of low mass .",
    "their results show that seds depend mostly on the evolutionary stage except for very extreme cases such as stars with an edge - on disk .",
    "thus , @xmath23 provides a good proxy for the evolutionary state of the ysos in l1688 .",
    "comparing with @xcite , the resulting classification is very similar , particularly for the class  i and flat - spectrum sources .",
    "most sources with a spectral slope @xmath49 according to our slope - fitting are class  i sources in both classification schemes . with two exceptions",

    "are also called class  ii by @xcite , but 30 are class  iii in that paper , indicating that a significant fraction of what we call class  ii might indeed be reddened background stars . the general agreement between the more complex classification scheme and the observed spectral slope is also found for other star forming regions ( paper  i ) .",
    "we use three different methods to detect variability in all lightcurves , independent of their membership status or sed slope .",
    "sources are considered variable , if they fullfill at least one of the following conditions : ( i ) a two - band lightcurve exisits and their stetson index is larger than 0.9 ( sect .  [ sect : stetsonindex ] ) ; ( ii ) only a one - band lightcurve exisits and @xmath50 ( sect .",

    "[ sect : periodicity ] ) .",
    "sources in the target fields are observed in irac  1 and irac  2 almost simultaneously ( within a few minutes ) . for those sources ,",
    "we calculate the stetson index @xmath51 with points weighted evenly @xcite : @xmath52 where the sum is taken over all @xmath53 pairs of observations in irac1 and irac2 with observed magnitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 and uncertainties @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; @xmath58 denotes the sign of @xmath59 .",

    "the stetson index is very robust to observational errors since those are unlikely to affect both bands in the same way .",
    "following paper  i , we define a source as variable if @xmath63 . in paper",
    "i , this is calculated over the first visibility window only ; in this article we use the lightcurve from all four visibility windows . the stetson index calculated for the first visibility window only can be found in table  [ tab : tab2 ] in column ` s1_stetson_36_45 ` and for the entire lightcurve in column ` stetson_36_45 ` .",
    "figure [ fig : stetsonlcs ] shows examples of lightcurves that are classified as variable according to the stetson index . in the first visibility window , we find 34 sources to be variable , that is 18% of all lightcurves where we can calculate the stetson index .",
    "the number is similar ( 38 sources , 18% ) if we consider all observing visibility windows .",
    "this is not surprising , given that the stetson index is designed to be a `` robust '' statistic that is little influenced by a small number of datapoints , and compared to the first visibility window , the other visibility windows only contribute a small number of datapoints .",
    "we caution that equation  [ eqn : stetson ] will introduce a systematic bias in such a way that a source that is variable in only one band will not be recognized as variable .",
    "[ sect : chi2 ]    for sources outside the primary target fields or for sources which are too bright or too faint in one irac channel , the stetson index can not be calculated . for those sources we rely on the reduced chi - squared value to detect variability : @xmath64 instrumental uncertainties lead to a non - gaussian error distribution ,",
    "so we use a conservative cut - off and mark sources as variable only if @xmath65 ( paper  i ) . using this metric",
    ", we find 22 sources that exhibit variability in irac1 and 18 that exhibit variability in irac2 .",
    "for comparison , we note that of the 38 sources classified as variable according to their stetson index in the last section , 34 are also variable according to the @xmath22 test for their irac1 lightcurve and 37 according to their irac2 lightcurve .",

    "no star classified as a member is fainter than 14  mag",
    ".    the observed fraction of variable stars as a function of sed class is the best guess for the probability to find variability for a star of a given sed class .",
    "we calculate the uncertainty for the probability based on the observed number of variable stars @xmath77 in a bin with @xmath53 total sources as follows : if the true probability for a source in the bin to be variable is @xmath78 , then the probability to observe @xmath77 variables in @xmath53 stars is given by @xmath79 , which follows a binomial distribution : @xmath80 the peak of this distribution is @xmath81 .",

    "this includes eclipsing systems , stars with unusually large photospheric spots and other unidentified variables .",
    "all effects that influence the @xmath69 lightcurve are likely also visible in the mid - ir .",
    "our fraction of variable objects with a class  iii sed is similar ( 1.8% ) to what wolk et al .  found . in the optical and near - ir ,",

    "all three clusters are located at larger distances and thus observations are less sensitive to small variations , the observations of @xcite are more densely sampled and thus provide a better signal . in l1688 , a k5 star with little extinction will have a magnitude of 12.2 in @xmath5 m using the evolutionary tracks of and the yso colors from @xcite . in this magnitude range ,",
    "variability down to 0.05  mag can be detected ( paper  i ) .",
    "in contrast , for the same star in ic  348 , the variability has to be about twice as large to be detected and three times as large to the detected in the onc .",
    "of course , even our observations miss the faint end of the distribution .",
    "thus , it seems likely that essentially all ysos show substantial mid - ir variability on timescales of days to weeks .",
    "sources with a class  iii sed are not contaminated by disk - bearing stars , since reddening by the cloud can only increase the spectral slope @xmath23 but never hide an existing ir excess",
    ". the larger fraction of non - member variable objects in the other classes in figure  [ fig : probvarsed ] thus shows that the membership lists are incomplete .",
    "one caveat here is that the class  iii sources in the sample of members are selected in a different way than the other classes . if true class  iii cluster members with x - ray emission ( that are included in our member sample )",
    "are systematically less variable than class  iii members where we do not detect x - ray emission ( that are therefore not included in the member sample ) , that would also lead to a lower observed variability fraction in class  iii member sources .",
    "however , given the size of the observed effect in variability such a bias seems to be unlikely to be the sole reason for the observed distribution .    the observed probability that a source is variable for all classes of bright non - members ( blue bars ) is consistent with around 5%",
    "the fact that this barely changes with the sed class , quite unlike the distribution for the cluster members , indicates that unidentified cluster members can not make up a large fraction of the non - member sample since they would bias the observed variability fraction to higher values for the earlier classes .",
    "the vastly different number of sources in the different bins makes it highly unlikely that each bin is contaminated by the same fraction of class  i - ii cluster members .",
    "the sample of faint stars has almost the same fraction of variable sources in every sed class .",
    "the low fraction can be explained by two effects .",
    "first , variability of faint sources can not be reliably detected unless the amplitude is exceptionally large .",
    "second , as most cluster members are brighter than 14  mag , the faint sample contains fewer unrecognized cluster members than the sample of brighter sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : meanampsed ] shows that there is a wide distribution of amplitudes in ysos of class i , f and ii .",
    "the error bars in this figure represent the standard deviation of the mean amplitudes within one class .",
    "amplitude and standard deviation in the figure are measured in magnitudes ; a median amplitude of 0.1  mag means that the flux in @xmath33 m varies by 10% for a typical source . for members ,",
    "the variability amplitude is larger in class  i sources than in flat - spectrum and class  ii sources , where the amplitude is still larger than in class  iii sources .",
    "also , the spread of the amplitudes in class i and f is much larger than for class ii and iii . for non - members ,",
    "the observed amplitudes seem to follow a similar , but less pronounced trend .",
    "this suggests that the non - member category still includes not only reddened background objects with an intrinsic class  iii sed , but also some unidentified cluster members .",
    "indeed , we propose that all variable class  i , f and ii sources are members and table  [ tab : newmembers ] lists those new members that are neither contained in our ysovar standard membership set ( see table  [ tab : tab2 ] ) nor in @xcite .",
    "however , for consistency , we do not modify our sample of members at this point and continue to treat the sources in the table as non - members for the remainder of the analysis .",

    "the cmd slopes of the 37 sources with a well - defined slope are shown in figure  [ fig : cmdslope ] .",
    "the x and the y axis in the cmd are correlated , because they both depend on the @xmath5 m magnitude so sources which are noise - dominated would show a slope of @xmath97 .",
    "no source is seen in this region .    from a total of 42 variable sources with cmds with at least ten datapoints ,",
    "37 can be fitted with a formal uncertainty on the best fit slope below @xmath98 . in four of the five sources with a statistical error on the slope in the cmd @xmath99 ,",
    "the color variability is dominated by observational uncertainties ; the remaining source iso - oph  140 is discussed below .    as can be seen in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , even in those sources with a well defined slope in the cmd ,",
    "the scatter around the best linear fit is larger than the measurement uncertainties ; individual visibility windows are systematically above or below the fitted line .",
    "the slopes shown in figure  [ fig : cmdslope ] can be separated ( somewhat arbitrarily ) in two groups .",
    "one group becomes redder when the sources are fainter with slopes comparable to the ism reddening .",
    "this group contains almost all variables that are not classified as cluster members in section  [ sect : l1688membership ] .",

    "sources that bluen ( we use the term `` bluen '' as a verb to mean that a source comes bluer similar to the common expressions `` redden '' or `` reddening '' ) when they are fainter are mostly class  ii and flat spectrum sources . figure  [ fig : morelcs ] shows the lightcurves and cmds for two of the bluening sources , and .",
    "the top panel in figure  [ fig : cmdslope ] quantifies the magnitude of the reddening or bluening observed in each source . for a source",
    "where the slope in the cmd is compatible with ism reddening , this can be interpreted as the @xmath95 of the intervening material .",
    "a range of values is observed , but in most sources it is @xmath49  mag .",
    "no significant difference in vector length is seen between sources that bluen or redden when they dim .",
    "we discuss the physical mechanisms that could cause these slopes in section  [ sect : scenariosforcolorchanges ] .    comparing the amplitudes of all sources in figure  [ fig : cmdslope ]",
    "that either redden or bluen over the full time span of the observations , we do not find significant differences in value or distribution of the variability amplitudes .",
    "similar to our results , find reddening and bluening slopes in the cmd in their @xmath100 monitoring , but compared to figure  [ fig : cmdslope ] they see a higher fraction of stars that bluen as they dim ( 33/49 ) .",
    "only six sources have well defined slopes in both their study and ours . in the data of ,",
    "all of them belong to the group that bluen with lower fluxes . in five cases ,",
    "our data agree .",
    "in contrast , roxn  44 reddens in our observations , so its behavior changed over the time interval of five years , or it is behaving differently in the near and mid - ir .      is the only source with a statistical error on the slope in the cmd @xmath99 where the color variability is not dominated by observational uncertainties , but where the slope varies substantially over time .",
    "its lightcurve and cmd for the first visibility window are shown in figure  [ fig : cmdsquare ] .",
    "it has a class  ii sed slope and is a low mass yso ( spectral type m1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is no single slope in the cmd ; instead the source seems to switch between different modes .",
    "initially , the luminosity drops sharply , while the color becomes slightly bluer . the behavior changes around mjd 55305 . for the next 15 days , the source becomes redder and dimmer , but the slope is less steep than the ism reddening law .",
    "the evolution is not monotonic , but a brightening ( e.g.  around mjd 55313 ) corresponds to a bluer color and the source reddens as it dims . at the end of this period ,",
    "the brightness increases again sharply and the slope in the cmd is comparable to the period mjd 55295 to 55305 : the source becomes noticeably redder with higher luminosity . in the last 10 days of the monitoring , the source again has a slope close to the ism reddening law .",
    "its luminosity continues to increase and the color bluens until it has a similar color and luminosity as it did at the beginning of the monitoring .",
    "this closes the circle in the cmd .",
    "this is the only source in our sample where we observe multiple changes of the reddening slope over time . in this case ,",
    "variability similar to ism reddening corresponds to slow changes in luminosity , while the other direction of the slope in the cmd is associated with faster luminosity changes .",
    "now we discuss the lightcurves with the largest changes in magnitude in our sample .",
    "wl  4 , shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , has an outburst event consisting of a brightness increase by about 0.6  mag and bluening at the same time . the rise and",
    "fall take only a few days and the entire outburst lasts about a month .",
    "[ edj2009 ]  892 ( shown in the same figure ) presents a slow rise by about 0.2  mag in @xmath33 m and smooth decay over two years where the source gradually bluens ( although more activity between visibility windows can not be excluded ) .",
    "there is an indication of a slow and smooth increase in brightness again in the last observing visibility window , pointing to a recurring phenomenon .",
    "these timescales are much longer than the dynamical time in the inner disk , so they are presumably driven by disk phenomena that originate at larger radii .",
    "@xcite identified a few such bursting or fading events in their analysis of ysovar data for the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) and they have also been observed in the optical @xcite . the physical cause is not known yet .",
    "@xcite find a few lightcurves that match theoretical predictions for short mass accretion events , but without simultaneous spectroscopy this is hard to prove .",
    "the best example presented here , wl  4 , becomes bluer during the burst , but the opposite happens for wl  3 , which otherwise has a similar lightcurve .",
    "thus , it is likely that different mechanisms cause these burst events .",
    "the reddening sources in figure  [ fig : cmdslope ] have slopes that are roughly compatible with the slope of an interstellar reddening law .",
    "small deviations can be explained by modifications of the dust - to - gas ratio or the grain size and composition .",
    "this is commonly observed in individual young stars and star forming regions as a whole @xcite .",
    "the most prominent example of a class  ii source where the extinction changes on timescales of days is . in this case ,",
    "the absorption dip is periodic and caused by an inner disk warp partially occulting the star .",
    "many examples of comparable lightcurves have been found in the onc by @xcite and in ngc  2264 by @xcite .",
    "these authors call objects with absorption events in the lightcuve `` dippers '' .",
    "we observe reddening on timescales of months to years in about half of all sources with a well - defined slope in the cmd .",
    "an example of that is shown in the top right panel of figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "we do not know the inclination of the objects in our sample , but if it is close to edge - on , this might be caused by an asymmetric disk similar to aa  tau .",
    "the required warp or local change in scale height that lets some gas and dust protrude above the average disk height , could be caused by a low - mass star , brown dwarf or planetary mass object orbiting in the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , vortices in the disk or dust traps can also change the local scale height .",
    "changes in the optical brightness and color of a yso are often attributed to spots , either hot accretion spots or cold magnetic spots , rotating in and out of view or to time - variable extinction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the reddening increases and , at the same time , the visible fraction of the hot spot decreases , then the resulting slope in the cmd would be intermediate between ism reddening and colorless .",
    "since spots on the star can not explain sources that bluen as they dim , this observed phenomenon must be related to the disk .",
    "several parameters of the inner disk could be time variable .",
    "the most obvious one is the accretion rate .",
    "however , the direct effect of increased accretion is a larger accretion spot , which would make the star bluer and brighter , not fainter .",
    "also , @xcite find no relation between mid - ir lightcurves and spectroscopic accretion tracers in their limited sample .",
    "this indicates that the relevant parameter can change without affecting the accretion rate . in the mid - ir",
    ", we see the optically thick dust at the inner disk edge .",
    "because the disk is heated over its entire vertical height at the inner edge while only the disk surface absorbs radiation at larger radii , it can form a puffed - up inner rim that reaches above the usual disk scale height and casts a shadow on the remaining disk , reducing the luminosity at longer wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this rim grows , it intercepts more stellar light .",
    "thus , the emission from the inner wall increases and the emission from the outer disk decreases , which results in bluer colors .",
    "since the total emitting area also decreases , the source can become bluer and fainter .",
    "@xcite also present radiative transfer models with hot spots and warped disks that reproduce features of the observed lightcurves .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggested a non - axisymmetric model . if the emission from the stellar photosphere is stronger at some longitudes due to a strong accretion spot or a spot from magnetic activity on the star , it irradiates the inner disk like a searchlight beam and causes the dust at this longitude to retreat .",
    "the result is a disk where the inner rim is broken at one ( or several ) positions .",
    "this would reduce the emission in @xmath5 m , but cause more energy to be emitted at a larger radius , where the dust is cooler on average and thus emits at longer wavelengths such as @xmath6 m . in this way",
    ", the source can become redder as it brightens .",
    "there is one group of ysos , the so - called ux ori ( uxor ) variables where several members have been observed to bluen when they fade in optical observations .",
    "this can be explained by a larger fraction of scattered light that contributes to the observed sed in their faint state .",
    "a similar scenario for the ysos discussed here requires , first , scattering by relatively large grains ( @xmath101  mm ) , because only for large grains radiation at @xmath32 m will be scattered more than radiation at @xmath33 m .",
    "grains this large will be present in the disk , but not at all radii and all disk heights .",
    "second , for this mechanism to work , a large fraction of the ir radiation must be scattered light and not intrinsic emission . in contrast",
    ", many bluening sources are class  i to flat - spectrum sources , where the ir luminosity is comparable to the total stellar irradiation .",
    "none of the simple models presented so far offers a convincing explanation of the observed lightcurves and cmds .",
    "however , detailed simulations that take into account turbulent transport processes in the disk and different dust species with a complete chemical network have not yet been performed .",
    "the real situation is likely to be much more complex than sketched above . since different dust species form and sublimate with different speeds and at different temperatures ,",
    "time variable irradiation can actually cause a very complex mixture of species with different opacities , which will not react linearly to increased irradiation . such a complex network might cause a delayed and non - linear response of the disk , which masks the underlying relation between accretion and disk emission .",
    "the characteristics of the time variability in the lightcurves could be related to the spectral type of the central star as hotter stars irradiate the disk with harder spectra .",
    "we compared the 90% quantiles of the observed @xmath6 m magnitudes for those sources in our sample that have spectroscopically determined spectral types from @xcite .",
    "we use the relation between spectral type and @xmath102 from @xcite .",
    "this gives values for ten objects in our sample and we do not find a correlation in this set .",
    "similarly , @xcite do not identify any trends in infarared variability versus effective temperature among few myr old ngc 2264 stars .",
    "in apparent contrast , @xcite find that the variability in [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] increases with increasing @xmath102 , but they show that this trend probably does not reflect a change in disk properties , but is instead due to the lower relative contribution of the photosphere compared to the disk for hotter stars .      in this section ,",
    "we analyze the subsample of sources with x - ray counterparts .",
    "since the subsample is not selected for its ir properties , it provides a clean sample to calculate the variability fraction .",
    "there are 31 sources with detected x - ray emission , of which 20 are variable in the ir .",
    "again , we find high variability fractions in class  i ( 6/7 ) , f ( 3/4 ) and ii ( 11/15 ) , while none of the four class  iii sources is variable .",
    "the sample size is small , but this is consistent with our analysis of the ir selected sample in section  [ sect : evolutionarytrendsofthevariability ] .",
    "we searched for correlations between the parameters of the x - ray emission ( median energy , fitted temperature and absorbing column density ) and the amplitude of the mid - ir variability .",
    "no such correlation is apparent within each sed class . for a given absorbing column density ,",
    "soft x - ray emission is more strongly absorbed than hard x - ray emission .",
    "thus , the observed x - ray spectrum from more embedded sources always appears harder .",
    "since class  ii sources have more circumstellar matter than class  iii sources , it is not surprising that they appear harder . @xcite already discuss this for the l1688 x - ray data ; figure  [ fig : probvarsed ] and [ fig : meanampsed ] show that class  ii sources are more variable than class  iii sources .",
    "we see no additional effect of the x - ray emission on the variability characteristics in the mid - ir .",
    "we present _ spitzer _ observations of ysos in the star forming region l1688 .",
    "observations were taken in four visibility windows in spring and fall of 2010 and 2011 , with about 70 observations in spring 2010 and about ten observations in the remaining visibility windows .",
    "the cadence of the observations is non - uniform to avoid bias in the period detection .",
    "our sample consists of 882 sources with lightcurves in irac1 and irac2 with at least 5 datapoints . of those 882 sources , we classify 70 sources as variable using the stetson test , the @xmath22 test and the lomb - scagle periodogram .",
    "the faintest sources in the sample have @xmath103  mag , but naturally the measurement uncertainties are larger for fainter sources .",
    "the algorithms detect variability if the amplitude is larger than @xmath104  mag for a source of @xmath105  mag .",
    "we define a sample of cluster members , including sources with an ir excess due to a circumstellar disk or with x - ray emission . for cluster members",
    ", there is a clear correlation between evolutionary status and ir variability .",
    "more embedded sources are more often detected to be variable , and they have on average larger variability amplitudes .",
    "overall , the data are consistent with the idea that all ysos are variable at @xmath5 m and @xmath6 m , and we thus propose that all variable sources in our sample are members of the l1688 star forming region .    qualitatively different morphological types of lightcurves can be distinguished : 14 lightcurves are detected to be periodic ; beyond that , we find quasi - periodic lightcurves , where the variability has an apparent timescale , but is not regular enough to be detected as periodic ; aperiodic lightcurves without a preferred timescale ; and long - term variable lightcurves where variability is apparent , but no periodicity or time - scale can be determined within the observational window .",
    "in addition , there are lightcurves with short , non - repeating bursts or dips .",
    "roughly half of all sources become redder when they are fainter ; the other half becomes bluer .",
    "the reddening values of the first group are compatible with ism reddenig .",
    "the color changes in the second group require variability in the inner disk structure as proposed by @xcite or @xcite .",
