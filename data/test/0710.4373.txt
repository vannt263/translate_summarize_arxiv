    "strange particles have played a major role in high - energy physics since the early 1950s . originally , `` strange '' meant ` created in pairs , with a new quantum number , @xmath2 , respectively ' .",
    "it should also be understood that the meaning of `` high - energy physics '' continued to change in step with the construction of more and more powerful accelerators . in the collider era",
    ", the title question attracts renewed interest in connection with the extended volumes of high energy - density matter created in nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath1 ) collisions as the high - energy frontier moves from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) to the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "rhic collides gold nuclei at 200 @xmath3gev center - of - mass energy .",
    "the lhc will operate at more than an order of magnitude higher energies .",
    "the historical roots stretch back to the 1940s : curious v - shaped tracks were found in emulsion , primarily in @xmath4 decays .",
    "the mysterious _v - particles_ were the first observed examples of matter with strangeness content .",
    "later the @xmath5 particle was identified and described by the additive quark model and the name `` strangeness '' was suggested by m. gell - mann in the middle of the 50s  @xcite .",
    "another period of excitement was ushered in by the discovery of the @xmath6 in the famous `` november revolution '' of 1974  @xcite .",
    "this opened a new era of high - energy physics : strange quarks no longer represented the heaviest flavor , not present as valence contributions in everyday baryons .",
    "it was expected that at high energies the new ( `` charm '' ) quarks will play a role similar to that of the strange quarks at lower energies as the small mass difference of the up , down , and strange quarks becomes negligible . as a consequence ,",
    "it is natural to expect that in the high energy - density phase ( quark - gluon plasma , qgp ) up , down , and strange quarks have similar populations and play equivalent roles .",
    "this expectation is not completely borne out at rhic ; does it become a good approximation at lhc energies ?    the non - abelian quark - gluon matter can not be observed directly , but the abundances of final - state hadrons should be sensitive to the strangeness content .",
    "this is the basis of the so - called `` strangeness signature '' of the qgp , specifically the expected enhancement of strange anti - baryon production , as proposed by mller and rafelski  @xcite and independently by br and zimnyi  @xcite .",
    "what can we expect from the @xmath7 @xmath3tev @xmath8 collisions , where more final - state strange particles are produced with larger transverse momenta ( `` hard probes '' ) , and perturbative quantum chromo - dynamics ( pqcd ) is to provide more precise predictions ?",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the role of strangeness will finally change at these energies , where we are going to have a more precise `` microscope '' in the form of the lhc experiments .",
    "do the @xmath9 quarks behave as light quarks ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and does charm appear as the `` first massive '' flavor ?    in this paper we present calculations for @xmath12 and @xmath13 ratios from @xmath1 collisions at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "we include the effect of nuclear modifications on the produced particles .",
    "we present the results in terms of double ratios of nuclear modification factors .",
    "the particle ratios were calculated using hadron spectra as provided by our perturbative qcd improved parton model  @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the factorization theorem and generates the invariant cross section as a convolution of ( nuclear ) parton distribution functions @xmath14 , perturbative qcd cross sections @xmath15 , fragmentation functions @xmath16 , and nuclear thickness functions @xmath17 .",
    "we perform the calculation following refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the factorization and fragmentation scales , respectively , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are momentum fractions , and @xmath24-s stand for two - dimensional transverse momentum vectors .",
    "the initial state effects of shadowing and multiscattering are included following the ideas in refs .",
    "the collision geometry is described by the impact parameter ( @xmath25 ) dependent glauber nuclear thickness functions , @xmath26 .    for the nuclear parton distributions ( pdfs )",
    "we have applied the mrst central gluon ( cg ) set  @xcite with the updated hijing shadowing  @xcite . intrinsic transverse momentum and multiple scattering",
    "are treated according to ref .",
    "@xcite . for the fragmentation functions ( ffs )",
    ", we used a recent set by albino , kniehl , and kramer  @xcite to calculate the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 spectra .",
    "all calculated hadron spectra are charge averaged , thus pions , kaons , protons , and lambdas are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively .    in the model the energy loss of partons propagating through the high energy - density matter was taken into account along the lines of the glv treatment  @xcite . in this picture",
    "the amount of jet energy loss is parameterized in terms of the nuclear opacity @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the average distance traveled by the parton in the medium and @xmath37 stands for the mean free path .",
    "opacity @xmath38 signifies no jet quenching , high values correspond to central collisions of heavy nuclei .",
    "we are interested in the nuclear modification for strange species relative to hadrons not containing strange quarks , i.e. pions and protons .",
    "for this purpose we introduce the double ratio of different hadron s nuclear modification factors , @xmath39_{aa } \\left/   \\left [ \\frac{h^s}{h}\\right]_{pp } , \\right . \\label{rss_def}\\ ] ] where we used the notation @xmath40 for charged - averaged strange hadrons and @xmath41 for non - strange hadrons .",
    "the nuclear modification factor is defined as @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the average number of binary collisions in the various impact - parameter bins , which is determined by the geometry of the collisions and cancels from the double ratio ( [ rss_def ] ) .",
    "the last equation of ( [ rss_def ] ) indicates that the double ratio of nuclear modification factors can be obtained as the double ratio of strange - to - non - strange ratios in @xmath1 to @xmath0 collisions .",
    "on the _ left side _ of fig . [ fig1 ] , in the bottom panel , @xmath12 ratios are plotted as measured by the phenix collaboration in @xmath0 collisions  @xcite and by the star collaboration in @xmath44 collisions  @xcite at @xmath45 @xmath3gev rhic energy , together with calculated @xmath12 ratios in @xmath0 collisions ( _ dotted line _ ) and @xmath44 collisions without jet energy loss ( @xmath46 , _ dashed _ ) and with opacity @xmath47 ( _ solid line _ ) for the most central ( @xmath48 ) @xmath44 collisions . in the top panel",
    "we show the calculated double ratios ( [ rss_def ] ) relative to @xmath0 collisions without ( _ dashed _ ) and with ( _ solid line _ ) jet energy loss , compared to those obtained from the data .",
    "( note that the experimental double ratios naturally have large uncertainties . )",
    "ratios in @xmath44 and @xmath0 collisions compared to phenix @xmath0  @xcite star @xmath44  @xcite data ( _ left side _ ) and @xmath49 ratios with @xmath0 collision data from star  @xcite ( _ right side _ ) .",

    "( [ rss_def]).,title=\"fig : \" ]    the experimental @xmath50 ratios are very similar to each other at low @xmath51 , although a slight hint of strangness enhancement is indicated by the @xmath52 20 % increase in nucleus - nucleus collision relative to proton - proton collisions",
    ". however , this region can not be investigated by pqcd calculations . at high @xmath51 , forgeting the large error bars for a moment , the data in the top left panel show some suppression of kaons in @xmath44 collisions .",
    "do the theoretical calculations indicate a similar tendency ?",
    "the answer is yes , as displayed by fig .",
    "1 . introducing stronger jet quenching with larger opacity in @xmath44 collisions , the @xmath12 ratio is decreasing .",
    "at very high @xmath51 the data appear to fall faster than the theoretical curves .",
    "more data are needed with higher precision for a final answer .",
    "one needs to also keep in mind that data from phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite were combined to obtain the experimental points in the top panel .",
    "considering the strange - to - non - starnge ratio , while the proton - proton calculations overestimate the data by up to a factor 2 , there is a hint of potential agreement between the data and the calculations with an opacity of @xmath47 in the bottom panel .",
    "unfortunately , as mentioned above , the calculations can not be extended to lower momenta , where pqcd is no longer reliable ( technically due to pdf and ff limitations ) .",
    "on the _ right side _ of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show similar information for @xmath49 ratios . here , the calculated curves run very close to each other in the bottom panel .",
    "the data are for @xmath0 collisions from refs .",
    "( we are not aware of measured @xmath44 @xmath49 ratios , and we encourage such analysis . ) in summary , the mesonic @xmath12 ratio is more sensitive to jet energy loss in heavy - ion collisions than the @xmath49 baryonic ratio .",
    "the reason is very simple : at lower @xmath51 meson production is dominated by gluon fragmentation , which slowly turns into the dominance of quark fragmentation with increasing @xmath51 . on the other hand , baryon production is dominated by leading quark fragmentation in a wide @xmath51 region . in this sense",
    "the investigation of @xmath53 may be more interesting because the gluons have a larger contribution to this ratio .",
    "we repeat our calculations for @xmath8 collisions for @xmath54 @xmath3tev lhc energy .",
    "the results are displayed on fig .",
    "the opacity is expected to be higher at lhc due to the higher available energy . using a simple @xmath55 estimate",
    ", we obtain @xmath56 in the most central @xmath48 @xmath8 collisions . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the results with @xmath38 and @xmath57 .",
    "on the bottom panel in the _ left side _ we show the @xmath12 ratios with the double ratios on top , up to high transverse momenta .",
    "right side _ contains the prediction for the @xmath49 ratios .",

    "the lower- and intermediate-@xmath51 variation of the hadron ratios arises from the different strengths of the jet quenching for quark and gluon contributions  @xcite . due to the quark dominated fragmentation",
    ", the difference disappears at high-@xmath51 in the ratios .",
    "we find that strangeness still behaves differently from the up and down quark contributions at lhc energies in that the @xmath12 and @xmath49 ratios are still below unity at @xmath58 5.5 @xmath3tev .",
    "the strange - to - non - strange ratios are similar for mesons and baryons , and are expected to be similar at lhc to what was seen at rhic . on the other hand , mesonic ratios show more structure in the intermediate momentum region , because gluonic contributions have a bigger role in this momentum window .",
