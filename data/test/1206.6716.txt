    "in quantum information science , quantum state transfer ( qst ) , as the name suggests , refers to the transfer of an arbitrary quantum state @xmath0 from one qubit to another .",
    "there are two major mechanisms for qst in quantum mechanics . the first approach is usually characterized by preparing the quantum channel with an _ always - on _ interaction where qst is equivalent to the time evolution of the quantum state in the time - independent hamiltonian  bose1,song , christandle1 . however , these approaches require precise control of distance and timing",
    ". any deviation may lead to significant errors .",
    "the other approach has paid much attention to adiabatic passage for coherent qst in time - evolving quantum systems , which is a powerful tool for manipulating a quantum system from an initial state to a target state .",
    "this method of population transfer has the important property of being robust against small variations of the hamiltonian and the transport time , which is crucial experimentally since the system parameters are often hard to control .",
    "recently , the adiabatic method has been applied to a variety of physical systems to realize coherent qst . among these",
    ", the typical scheme for coherently spatial population transfer has been independently proposed for neutral atoms in optical traps  @xcite and for electrons in quantum dot ( qd ) systems  @xcite via a dark state of the system , which is termed coherent tunneling via adiabatic passage ( ctap ) following  @xcite .",
    "in such a scheme , the tunneling interaction between adjacent quantum units is dynamically tuned by changing either the distance or the height of the neighboring potential wells following a counterintuitive scheme , which is a solid - state analog of the well - known stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) protocol  @xcite of quantum optics . since then",
    ", the ctap technique has been proposed in a variety of physical systems for transporting single atoms  @xcite , spin states  @xcite , electrons  @xcite and bose - einstein condensates  bec1,bec2,bec3 .",
    "it has also been proposed as a crucial element in the scale up to large quantum processors  @xcite .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite presented a scheme to adiabatically transfer an electron from the left end to the right end of a three dot chain using the ground state of the system .",
    "this technique is a copy of the frequency chirping method  @xcite , which is used in quantum optics to transfer the population of a three - level atom of the lambda configuration .",
    "the scheme  @xcite is presented as an alternative to a well known transfer scheme ( ctap )  @xcite .",
    "however , different from the ctap process , the protocol in ref .",
    "@xcite considers a three qd array with an _ always - on _ interaction that can be manipulated by the external gate voltage applied on the two external dots ( sender and receiver ) . through maintaining the system in the ground state",
    ", it shows that it is a high - fidelity process for a proper choice of system parameters and also robust against experimental parameter variations . in this paper",
    "we will consider the passage through the @xmath1-site coupled qds array ( tight - binding model ) , which is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "gates applied on the two end dots control the on - site energy of each dot . in particular , the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitudes are set to be uniform .",
    "we first investigate the effect of system parameters on the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state . taking a 5-dot structure as an example ,",
    "we show that the electron can be robustly transported from one end of the chain to the other by slowly varying the gate voltages .",
    "this structure is easy to extend to an arbitrary number of sites .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the model is setup and we describe the adiabatic transfer of an electron between qds . in sec .",
    "iii we show numerical results that substantiate the analytical results .",

    "we introduce a simple tight - binding chain with uniform nearest - neighbor hopping integral @xmath4 as a quantum data bus for long - range quantum transport , see fig .",
    "the sender ( alice ) and the receiver ( bob ) can only control the external gate voltages @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath3 , which are applied on the two end qds . in this proposal ,",
    "the quantum information @xmath7 encoded in the polarization of the electron can be transported from alice to bob . in this scheme",
    "the spin state of the electron is a conserved quantity for the hamiltonian of the medium , so the spin state can not be influenced during the propagation . for simplicity , we will disregard the electron s spin degrees of freedom in the following discussion and just illustrate the principles of qst .    accounting only for the occupation of the lowest single - particle state of each dot ,",
    "the system is described by an @xmath1-site tight - binding chain .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath8where @xmath9 denotes the spinless fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator at the @xmath10-th quantum site .",
    "@xmath4 @xmath11is the coupling constant , which accounts for the hopping of the electron between dots @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",

    ", one can see that the system will end up in @xmath44 @xmath45    the analysis above is based on the assumption that the adiabaticity is satisfied . the crucial requirement for adiabatic evolution",
    "is @xmath46which greatly suppresses the quantum transition from the ground state @xmath47 to the first - excited state @xmath48 .",
    "firstly , one must make sure that no level crossings occur , i.e. , @xmath49 . to evaluate instantaneous eigenvalues of the hamiltonian",

    "the eigenvalues shown in this figure exhibit pronounced avoided crossing and approach nonzero minimum @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",

    "the numerical results indicate that the gap @xmath73 , which implies that the adiabatic transfer time of qst grows quadratically with the spatial separation of the two end states because the minimum gap plays an opposite role for the adiabatic qst .",
    "the other thing is that @xmath56 is also determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath74 . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) shows the numerically computed behavior of @xmath56  as a function of @xmath75 with @xmath57 and @xmath37 . from fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) we see that the gap becomes larger as @xmath74 increases and then tends to be a constant @xmath76 , which is the gap of tight - binding chain ( @xmath57 ) without any on - site energy .",
    "the reason is that the bigger @xmath77 is , the smaller the overlap amplitude of the two pulses , i.e. , @xmath78 .",

    "we initialize the device so that the electron occupies site-@xmath81 , i.e. , the total initial state is @xmath82 , and slowly apply gate pulses , which results in robust transport of the electron from one end of the chain to the other .",

    ", we find the result in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) . here",
    "the population transferred to the target state is only about 11% .",
    "the reason is that the population is excited to the upper energy states through nonadiabaticity .",
    "it is necessary to point out that if one enlarged @xmath16 extremely in this case , adiabaticity would be fulfilled , which would result in high transfer fidelity .    on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , enlarging @xmath74 can increase the level spacing between the first excited state and the ground state and hence cause the adiabaticity of the system to become better . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) we show the population evolution taking @xmath52 as an example and the populations of the states @xmath92 and @xmath44 are exchanged with a fidelity of @xmath93 .",
    "the choice of pulse modulation is therefore important with the maximum transfer speed ultimately controlled by the adiabatic criteria for the transfer . to see the emergence of the adiabatic limit , we plot in fig .",
    "4(c ) the transfer fidelity as a function of the adiabaticity parameter @xmath94 .",
    "one can see that as @xmath95 increases there is an exponential appearance of the adiabaticity in the ideal limit .",
    "that means the smaller the overlapping of two pulses is , the more ideal adiabatic transfer takes place .",
    "this result is extendible to an arbitrary number of qds . in the discussion that follows ,",
    "we choose @xmath96 .",
    "( in units of @xmath97 ) as @xmath1 is increased under the condition that @xmath98 . as @xmath1",
    "is increased the energy gap is decreased , resulting in longer evolution time across the array .",
    "the solid line is the quadratic curve fitting , which indicates that the evolution time grows quadratically with the number of qds.,width=7 ]    in section ii , we showed that the energy gap @xmath56 also depends on the system parameters , such as the number of qds @xmath1 and coupling strength @xmath99 . in order to quantitatively",

    ", in practice the minimum possible transfer timescale of this adiabatic passage will be of the same order as @xmath104 .",
    "for a long enough evolution time @xmath16 , the maximum fidelity of this scheme depends on the contrast ratio between peak values @xmath105 @xmath106 and coupling constants @xmath99 .",
