    "the power of multi - wavelength photometric observations to recover galaxy redshifts has been known since the late fifties @xcite and it has been confirmed in the last decade with deep blank - field imaging surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although spectroscopic redshifts are much better in precision than photometric estimates , photometry has two important advantages with respect to spectra : the number of sources that can be observed at the same time and sensitivity .",
    "indeed , with a single photometric pointing it is possible to observe a large number of sources , while in general only a limited number of objects can simultaneously be targeted with spectroscopy .",
    "in addition , the spectroscopic observation of faint targets usually requires very long exposure times ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and the faintest objects detected in photometric maps are beyond the technical possibilities of contemporary spectrographs @xcite .",
    "photometric redshift determinations usually rely on the identification of strong features , such as the lyman or @xmath12 break , in a galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , after they are convolved with the transmission functions of the filters utilised in the observations .",
    "this is the reason why it is necessary to do a careful filter selection when planning observations , balancing depth and wavelength coverage , in order to minimise degeneracies and misidentifications when obtaining photometric redshifts .    the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( _ jwst _ , @xcite ) is a foremost space mission for the coming years and the awaited successor of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and _ spitzer space telescope _ at infrared wavelengths .",
    "it will have four instruments on board for imaging , spectroscopy and coronography , covering a wide range of wavelengths from 0.6  @xmath13 through 28.3  @xmath13 with sub - arcsec angular resolution .",
    "jwst_s main scientific aims is to study the formation and evolution of galaxies at early cosmic times . for this purpose ,",
    "deep blank - field imaging surveys will be carried out with two imaging cameras , namely the near infrared camera ( nircam ; * ? ? ? * ) and the mid infrared instrument ( miri ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the vast majority of cases",
    ", galaxy redshift determinations will be done through sed - fitting analysis and , therefore , it is crucial to understand the impact of choosing different filter combinations on the ability to recover the right redshifts for all the observed sources .",
    "nircam s filter wheels include eight broad - band filters , namely f070w , f090w , f115w , f150w , f200w , f277w , f356w and f444w , as well as a number of medium and narrow - band filters , covering the wavelength range @xmath0 .",
    "the miri imager contains nine different broad - band filters between 5 and 28  @xmath14 m .",
    "this latter wavelength range encompasses the redshifted stellar light of high-@xmath6 galaxies , as well as the hot dust radiation emitted by low-@xmath6 sources .",
    "the two shortest - wavelength bands that we consider here ( i.e. , f560w and f770w ) are the most sensitive in miri , so will be those primarily used for high-@xmath6 galaxy studies .",
    "the complementarity of nircam s and miri s wavelength coverages makes that both cameras should ideally be considered for deep galaxy surveys . while surveys with nircam alone will be sufficient to encompass the @xmath12 break of galaxies at @xmath15 , a secure measurement of the evolved stellar light ( around rest @xmath16 ) in @xmath17 galaxies",
    "will also require observations with the miri filters .",
    "however , due to different detector technology in the near- and mid - ir range , miri s sensitivity is significantly lower than that of nircam , making observers doubt whether it is convenient to invest time on long miri observations when planning deep galaxy surveys . at the same time",
    ", the lack of _ jwst _ coverage below @xmath18 requires considering whether observing fields with no ancillary shorter wavelength imaging can be effective to study galaxy evolution .",
    "here we address these issues through the analysis of galaxy redshift recovery in different data availability situations , all treated on an equal basis , in order to allow the reader decide which camera and filter configuration would be optimal for their scientific interests .",
    "the aim of this work is to assess the impact of different _ jwst _ broad - band filter combinations on recovering reliable photometric redshifts for galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to considering the nircam broad bands and miri f560w and f770w filters , we tested the need of ancillary data at @xmath5 , such as those provided by _ hst _ observations .",
    "we applied our tests to three different galaxy samples with known redshifts : 1 ) a spectroscopic galaxy sample at @xmath19 ; 2 ) a galaxy sample with consensus photometric redshifts at @xmath20 from the candels survey ; and 3 ) a mock galaxy sample generated with different spectral templates at @xmath21 , 8 , 9 and 10 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : samples ] we describe our three sample selection , the obtention of photometry in the relevant nircam and miri bands , and photometric redshift test methodology . in section [ sec : results ] we analyse our results at different redshifts , while in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our main findings and conclusions . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath2270  @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "all magnitudes refer to the ab system @xcite .",
    "we selected three different galaxy samples spanning rather complementary redshift ranges :    1 .   a sample of 2422 galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts at @xmath19 ; 2 .   a sample of 1375 galaxies with consensus photometric redshifts at @xmath20 ; 3 .   a sample of 2124 simulated galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "these three samples allowed us to investigate the different problems arising when trying to recover redshifts photometrically using different combinations of _ jwst _ filters . by no means are these samples trying to emulate a complete , flux - limited galaxy population at @xmath4 as it will be seen in a blank _ jwst _ field , and this is not necessary given the scope of this paper .",

    "this catalogue contains photometry in 17 broad bands , from 0.37 @xmath14 m through 8.0 @xmath14 m , obtained with ground - based and space telescopes , including _",
    "hst _ and _ spitzer _ @xcite .",
    "this wavelength sampling allows for a good - quality sed fitting of the galaxy stellar emission and a proper redshift recovery in the vast majority of cases , using standard galaxy spectral templates and photometric redshift codes .",
    "our aim here is to assess the impact of choosing different _ jwst _ filter sets on the derived photometric redshifts , rather than the performance of different photometric redshift codes and/or sed template libraries .",
    "therefore , we explicitly excluded from our analysis any galaxy from the parent spectroscopic sample for which we could not correctly recover the redshift photometrically using all the candels photometry up to @xmath27 .",
    "we did not use the two irac band data at longer wavelengths because their @xmath28 is considerably lower than for the other bands and they could be contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission at low @xmath6 .",
    "the excluded galaxies are only @xmath29 of all the galaxies with publicly available @xmath26 in the cdfs .    to obtain photometric redshift estimates for all the galaxies in the parent spectroscopic sample , we ran the public code _ lephare _",

    "[ fig : zspec ] ) , which constitute 92% of the parent spectroscopic sample , and adopted it as our sample 1 for all further analysis . the sample 1 redshift distribution",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : zdist ] .",
    "this distribution peaks around @xmath34 and has a high-@xmath6 tail up to @xmath35 , although the statistics are rather poor at @xmath17 .",
    "so , our main purpose with sample 1 is to study the percentage of low - redshift galaxies that can leak to high @xmath6 when different filter sets , and thus different wavelength coverages , are available .",
    "our second sample consists of 1375 galaxies at @xmath20 taken from the candels goods - s public catalogue . for this sample ,",
    "we considered as fiducial redshifts the consensus photometric redshifts that have been compiled by @xcite .",
    "the candels consensus photometric redshifts result from the comparison of 11 independent sed fitting runs .",
    "we considered only candels galaxies with @xmath17 here , as lower redshifts are well represented in our sample 1 .",
    "as we did for the sample with spectroscopic redshifts ( sample 1 ) , we obtained our own photometric redshifts by running _",
    "lephare _ on the candels 15-band photometry and using the same sed templates and parameter values stated before . in this case , our own photometric redshifts agree within 2@xmath32 ( @xmath330.10 ) with the candels consensus redshifts for 1375 ( 95% ) of the goods - s galaxies with candels redshifts @xmath36 ( fig .

    "thus , many observing programs may opt for using a single miri filter ( f560w or f770w ) rather than both of them .",
    "this is why we tested separately the cases in which a single and both miri bands are used .",

    "this consideration of a wide range of redshifts , ages and extinction values emulates the real situation in which one simply has a photometric input catalogue without knowing a priori which sources are at high or low redshifts .",

    "firstly , the degeneracies in redshift space are more important than for the general galaxy sample with @xmath115 .",
    "this is manifested in a much larger outlier percentage , namely @xmath125 when considering the nircam data alone .",
    "secondly , the effect of incorporating miri photometry becomes more noteworthy : including both miri bands reduces the percentage of outliers to @xmath126 .",
    "these effects are produced by two reasons : on the one hand , the nebular line emission boosts the miri fluxes and , thus , the @xmath28 of the miri data . on the other hand , the multiple emission lines in the _ yggdrasil _ templates with nebular emission result in similarly bright observed fluxes in contiguous filters , masking the continuum sed shape and making the sed fitting more difficult ( as explained in section  [ sec : z7bc03 ] ) , so having a longer baseline is necessary for a proper redshift recovery .    for the lowest quality photometry ( @xmath63 ; figure  [ fig : z7_yggsn3 ] ) , the percentage of catastrophic outliers in the entire sample is @xmath127 using only nircam photometry .",
    "the advantage of incorporating miri data , which also have lower @xmath28 , is less obvious in this case , as the percentage of @xmath3 outliers still remains high even with the two miri bands ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "a significant fraction of galaxies are detected in only a few ( nircam and miri ) bands , so the photometry provides poor constraints for the sed fitting , making degeneracies in redshift space become evident .    indeed ,",
    "as it is the case for the bc03-sed galaxies , the catastrophic outliers correspond mainly to sources with detections in four or less _ jwst _ bands ( empty regions in the histograms of figure  [ fig : z7_yggsn3 ] ) .",
    "however , in the case of the _ yggdrasil_-sed galaxies , the secondary peaks appearing in the output redshift distributions are quite more pronounced than for the bc03 galaxies .",
    "these secondary peaks are mainly produced by two kinds of templates that are not represented in our bc03-sed sample : 1 ) young galaxies with nebular emission .",
    "the combination of multiple emission lines and low @xmath28 produces an enhancement in the number of catastrophic outliers ; 2 ) young galaxies with @xmath59 ( i.e. , no emission lines ) and the highest extinction adopted to build our mock sample ( i.e. , @xmath129 ) . these galaxies have no analogues either in the bc03-based sample , as we explicitly incorporated the main emission lines in all galaxies with ages lower than the characteristic @xmath30 in the star formation history .    as a summary ,",
    "we conclude that the benefit of considering miri photometry along with the nircam data for _ yggdrasil_-sed galaxies is mainly obvious for nircam sources with moderate @xmath28 values , and particularly helpful in the case of seds with nebular emission . at low @xmath28",
    "the advantage is less obvious .",
    "this is in contrast to our conclusion for the bc03-sed galaxies , indicating that at low @xmath28 the importance of having miri data depends significantly on the galaxy spectral type .      in this section",
    "we show the miri magnitudes and nircam / miri colours of our simulated galaxies in sample 3 , as this can be a useful reference when planning _",

    "this k - correction effect makes that the median [ f560w ] value at this redshift is brighter for galaxies without emission lines , as those with emission lines correspond to younger galaxies with fainter continua which partly cancel the emission line flux enhancement ( table  [ tab : medmag56 ] ) . at @xmath135 and 10 , instead , the combination of the continuum k - correction and the nebular emission results in a net flux boosting in the case of emission - line galaxies .    for f770w ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f770wcol_bc03 ] ) , the flux enhancement due to the emission line presence is only evident at @xmath132 and 10 , as the h@xmath60 emission line enters the f770w wavelength window at these redshifts ( table  [ tab : medmag77 ] ) .",
    "most young galaxies at @xmath21 and 8 , instead , remain below our reference [ f770w]=28  mag detection limit , as their continua are blue and no emission line is present in this filter to help with the detection .",
    "so , the f770w filter will only allow us to detect evolved galaxies at @xmath68 or young line emitters at @xmath132 and 10 to a [ f770w]=28  mag cut .",

    "[ fig : f560wcol_ygg ] and [ fig : f770wcol_ygg ] and the corresponding tables ) . in this case , the flux enhacement is more obvious that for the bc03 templates because here we are comparing only young galaxies with and without lines ( segregated by their different gas covering factors ) , so all their continua are similarly blue . in both cases , however , the median miri magnitude values are @xmath136  mag .",
    "this implies that a miri galaxy survey to our reference depth will only detect a minority of star - forming galaxies with [ f150w]=29  mag at @xmath68 if their seds are similar to the _ yggdrasil _ templates .",
    "note that these galaxies are considerably brighter in f560w if they are at @xmath21 or 8 , while slightly brighter in f770w if at @xmath132 or 10 .",

    "this is the case both for ` passive galaxies ' ( galaxies which finished forming stars ) and for galaxies which are red simply because of the presence of prominent emission lines .",
    "so , as a summary , ` old ' galaxies at @xmath68 will easily be detected with miri in reasonably deep surveys , independently of their galaxy type . for young galaxies ,",
    "the situation is more complex , as it depends on to which extent line emission can compensate for the very faint continua which is characteristic in these sources .",

    "@xmath137 _ having photometry in the hst f435w and f606w bands , and if possible also in the ground - based @xmath67 band , is very important to have the fraction of low-@xmath6 contaminants under control_. this photometry is important to constrain the lyman break shift and , thus , the redshifts of low-@xmath6 sources .",

    "the reduction in the percentage of leaking sources is exclusively due to the incorporation of the _ hst _ bands .",

    "@xmath137 at f150w @xmath63 , the role of miri data in improving the redshift determination depends very much on the sed type . as ` old '",
    "galaxies are red , miri fluxes are brighter that nircam fluxes , so the incorporation of the miri data is of clear benefit for these sources . for star - forming galaxies ,",

    ", we argue that the results presented here constitute a useful reference for designing deep imaging surveys with _",

    "would significantly enlarge the requested observing times , observers must clearly assess the need and importance of the former for their specific studies .",
    "miri observations with both the f560w and f770w filters are necessary along with the nircam data if a correct identification of low and moderate redshift ( @xmath138 ) sources are desired in fields without @xmath152 coverage .",
    "alternatively , a less expensive strategy would be limiting galaxy surveys to fields with ancillary @xmath152 data of matching depth and obtaining only nircam data , but the lack of any miri imaging would still result in a slightly higher percentage of redshift outliers and a lower overall recovered - redshift precision .",
    "if the main science goal is simply identifying the bulk of the galaxy population at @xmath7 , proposing an observing program based on ultra - deep nircam data alone will be adequate .",
    "however , adding miri imaging will help improve the identification of red sources and is of utmost importance to recover stellar ages and stellar masses at @xmath54 ( bisigello et al .",

    "values , 0.023 in this case ( compared with 0.025 at @xmath21 ) and similar distribution shape .",

    "improves more when adding the f560w filter rather than with the f770w one .    at @xmath158 the main difference respect to the @xmath21 configuration and",
    "the previous one is that there are no emission lines inside the f356w band .",
    "when using nircam bands alone , it is already possible to obtain a good redshift estimation with totally no outliers and a small r.m.s .. this is because the absence of emission line inside the f356w band creates a strong contrast with the closest bands , allowing the code to properly identify the main sed features .",
    "moreover , this contrast happens in a narrow redshift range , confining the range of possible redshift solutions and producing a very small r.m.s .",
    "this is the most favourable configuration for the nircam bands among all considered redshifts . by adding the miri bands there is only a slight improvement to the already good redshift estimation .",

    "the main difference between this case and the @xmath135 one is that the flux observed in the f115w band , where the lyman break falls , is fainter and more often is below the 2@xmath32 detection limit . when using the nircam bands only the derived distribution is broad , but there are almost no outliers ( 0.5@xmath84 ) . when adding the miri bands , and in particular the f560w band , the r.m.s .",

    "finally , the @xmath160 case corresponds to a redshift in which [ oiii ] is just outside the f444w band , but h@xmath156 is still inside , while the opposite situation happens in the f560w miri band .",
    "the redshift estimation with nircam bands alone is generally good , with an r.m.s . of 0.019 and only one outlier .",
    "when adding the miri bands , there is a slight improvement in the redshift estimation ( r.m.s.@xmath32=0.012 ) and no outliers",
    ".    the cases presented here are slightly different from the cases presented in the main body of the paper , but do not lead to any significantly different conclusion .",
    "considering all eight analysed redshifts and @xmath115 , the redshift estimation by using only nircam broad bands alone is particularly good at @xmath161 and @xmath162 , but is the worst at @xmath159 and @xmath163 .",
    "adding miri bands , the redshift estimation improves at all considered redshifts , and , in the majority of cases , f560w decreases the r.m.s .",
    "a bit more than f770w .",
    "in sample 3 we derived fluxes for all nircam broad bands assuming the same integration time for all of them .",
    "however , the sensitivity of nircam peaks around 2 @xmath14 m , so different integration times could be considered in order to compensate for different sensitivities .",
    "therefore , we tested this alternative scenario by considering observations of the same depth for all nircam bands , i.e. , the f150w band depth , and we re - derived photometric redshifts for all galaxies in sample 3 .",
    "in particular , this method implies deeper observations for the less sensitive bands , i.e. f070w , f090w , f115w and f444w , respect to the method considered before , but shallower observations for the most sensitive bands , i.e. f200w and f277w .",
    "we did this test for both bc03 and yggdrasil templates and for all three @xmath28 values considered before ( 3,5 and 10 ) .",
    "we compared the mean and r.m.s .",
    "of the normalised redshift difference @xmath164 for the current case and that where we assumed the same integration time in all nircam filters .",
    "our results are shown in table  [ tab : samestn ] , while the r.m.s .",
    "values are also shown in figure  [ fig : rms_comparison ] . at @xmath112 ,",
    "the derived results considering the same depth are slightly better or similar than the one derived with the same integration times . on the other hand , at @xmath63 , results are similar or slightly worse . at @xmath115 the results are mixed , depending on the type of template and redshift considered .",
    "these results reveal a different importance of deep observations with the most sensitive and less sensitive nircam bands .",
    "in particular , deep observations with the less sensitive bands seem to improve results generally when the @xmath28 is high , while deep observations with the most sensitive bands are more crucial at low @xmath28 values .",
    "it is worth noticing that , despite the fact that reaching the same depth in all nircam filters improves the results derived using nircam bands alone , these results are still worse that those derived using nircam and miri bands together .",
