    "it is by now well - known that increasing the number of antennas in a wireless system can significantly increase capacity .",
    "since the seminal papers of foschini and gans @xcite and telatar @xcite , multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channels have been thoroughly investigated in theory ( see @xcite for a survey ) and implemented in practice @xcite .",
    "this capacity gain usually comes at the expense of more complex encoders and decoders and a great deal of work has gone into designing low - complexity mimo architectures . in this paper",
    ", we describe a new low - complexity architecture that can attain significantly higher rates than existing solutions of similar complexity .",
    "we focus on the case where each of the @xmath0 transmit antennas encodes an independent data stream ( see figure [ f : mimo ] ) .",
    "that is , there is no coding across the transmit antennas : each data stream @xmath1 is encoded separately to form a codeword @xmath2 of length @xmath3 .",
    "channel state information is only available to the receiver . from the receiver s perspective , the original data streams are coupled in time through encoding and in space ( i.e. , across antennas ) through the mimo channel .",
    "the joint maximum likelihood ( ml ) receiver simultaneously performs joint decoding across time and receive antennas .",
    "clearly , this is optimal in terms of both rate and probability of error .",
    "however , the computational complexity of jointly processing the data streams is high , and it is difficult to implement this type of receiver in wireless systems when the number of streams is large .",
    "instead , linear receivers such as the decorrelator and minimum - mean - squared error ( mmse ) receiver are often used as low - complexity alternatives @xcite .",
    "traditional linear receivers first separate the coupling in space by performing a linear projection at the front - end of the receiver . in order to illustrate this concept and motivate the proposed new approach , we consider the @xmath4 mimo channel characterized by the following matrix : @xmath5 the simplest choice of a linear receiver front - end _ inverts _ the channel matrix . this receiver is usually referred to as the _ decorrelator _ in the literature .",
    "that is , the receiver first applies the matrix @xmath6 to the received signal .",
    "overall , this converts the original channel into a new equivalent channel characterized by the identity matrix and colored gaussian noise , i.e. , to two scalar channels with correlated noise .",
    "the linear receiver then proceeds by separately decoding the output of each of these two channels .",
    "the well - known drawback of this approach is that the _ noise _ vector is also multiplied by the linear receiver front - end matrix given in , which alters the variances of its components . in our simple example , if we assume that the original channel had independent additive white gaussian noise of unit variance , the equivalent noises after the linear receiver front - end have variances of @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively . that is ,",
    "while the receiver front - end has nulled out cross - interference , it has also significantly increased the noise levels .",
    "the integer - forcing linear architecture advocated here is based on the recent insight that if on all transmit antennas , the same linear or lattice code is used , then it is possible to not only decode codewords themselves , but also _ integer _ linear combinations of codewords directly @xcite .",
    "let us denote the codeword transmitted on the first antenna by @xmath9 and the codeword transmitted on the second antenna by @xmath10 then , for the simple example matrix from , the receiver can decode the integer linear combination @xmath11 from the first receive antenna and the combination @xmath12 from the second receive antenna .",
    "from these ( following @xcite ) , it is possible to recover linear equations of the data streams over an appropriate finite field , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these equations can in turn be digitally solved for the original data streams . the key point in this example",
    "is that the noise variances remain unchanged , which increases the effective @xmath15 per data stream .",
    "note that for more general channel matrices beyond the simple example here , it will also be advantageous to first apply an appropriate linear receiver front - end , albeit following principles very different form merely inverting the channel matrix , as we explain in more detail in the sequel .    in this paper",
    ", we first consider the standard mimo channel and develop a new _ integer - forcing _ linear receiver architecture that provides multiplexing and diversity gains over traditional linear architectures .",
    "our approach relies on the compute - and - forward framework , which allows linear equations of transmitted messages to be efficiently and reliably decoded over a fading channel @xcite .",
    "we develop a multiple antenna version of compute - and - forward which employs the antennas at the receiver to rotate the channel matrix towards an effective channel matrix with integer entries .",
    "separate decoders can then recover integer combinations of the transmitted messages , which are finally digitally solved for the original messages .",
    "we show that this is much more efficient than using the receive antennas to separate the transmitted codewords and directly decoding each individual codeword .",
    "our analysis uses nested lattice codes originally developed to approach the capacity of point - to - point awgn and dirty - paper channels @xcite and for which practical implementations were presented in @xcite and subsequent works .",
    "next , we generalize the mimo channel model to include interference @xcite and show that the integer - forcing receiver architecture is an attractive approach to the problem of oblivious interference mitigation . by selecting equation coefficients in a direction that depends on both the interference space and the channel matrix , the proposed architecture reduces the impact of interference and attains a non - trivial gain over traditional linear receivers .",
    "furthermore , we show that the integer - forcing receiver achieves the same generalized degrees of freedom as the joint decoder .",
    "our proof uses techniques from diophantine approximations , which have also recently been used for interference alignment over fixed channels and the characterization of the degrees of freedom for compute - and - forward @xcite .    in the remainder of the paper ,",
    "we start with a formal problem statement in section  [ sec : problem ] , and then overview the basic existing mimo receiver architectures and their achievable rates in section  [ sec : existingarchitecture ] . in section  [ sec : architecture ] , we present the integer - forcing receiver architecture and a basic performance analysis .",
    "we show that the rate difference between the proposed receiver and traditional linear receivers can be arbitrarily large in section [ sec : fixedchannels ] .",
    "we study the outage performance of the integer - forcing linear receiver under a slow fading channel model in section [ sec : outage ] .",
    "we show that in the case where each antenna encodes an independent data stream , our architecture achieves the same diversity - multiplexing tradeoff as that of the optimal joint decoder . in section [ sec :",
    "interference ] , we consider the mimo channel with interference and show that the integer - forcing receiver can be used to effectively mitigate interference . we characterize the generalized degrees - of - freedom for the integer - forcing receiver and find that it is the same as for the joint decoder .    throughout the paper , we will use boldface lowercase to refer to vectors , @xmath16 , and boldface uppercase to refer to matrices , @xmath17 .",
