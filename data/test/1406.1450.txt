    "in our planetary system , most objects go around the sun following counterclockwise ( prograde ) orbits as viewed from above the north pole of our star .",
    "however , a large number of comets orbit the sun clockwise ( retrograde ) and a substantial percentage of these objects have highly inclined orbits .",
    "they are believed to have their origin in the oort cloud ( see e.g. duncan 2008 ) , a vast and remote spherical reservoir of cometary material tens of thousands of astronomical units in diameter that completely surrounds the solar system .    out of 3265 objects currently classified by the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) small - body database as comets ,",
    "1918 move in retrograde orbits ( 58.7% ) . for long - period comets",
    "the retrograde fraction is 49.7% , for halley - type comets is 35.7% and for jupiter - family comets is 16.7% .",
    "in contrast , only 53 of the 641502 currently catalogued asteroids orbit the sun clockwise ( 0.008% ) . for asteroids in the outer solar system ( catalogued as centaurs or trans - neptunian objects )",
    "the fraction of retrograde objects is 2.7% ( 48 out of 1804 ) .",
    "therefore , most retrograde asteroids have been found in the region of the giant planets and beyond . at 11.0%",
    "( 30 out of 272 catalogued objects in the jpl small - body database ) , centaurs have the highest retrograde fraction among all the dynamical groups or asteroid families .",
    "centaurs are a transient asteroidal population whose orbits cross those of the outer planets ( see e.g. di sisto and brunini 2007 )",
    ". most centaurs may have their origin in the trans - neptunian belt , some may have come from the oort cloud .",
    "the main source of centaurs remains to be discovered .",
    "they are probably an heterogeneous population with multiple sources ( see e.g. di sisto et al .",
    "2010 ) , perhaps none being dominant ( but see horner and lykawka 2010 ) .",
    "the most intriguing of the known centaurs are those moving in retrograde orbits .",
    "the study of retrograde centaurs , especially those following high inclination trajectories , may represent a rare opportunity to look at objects that have suffered little surface alteration over the age of the solar system ( sheppard 2010 ) .",
    "the three largest known ( in terms of absolute magnitude , @xmath0 ) retrograde centaurs are ( 342842 ) 2008  yb@xmath3 ( @xmath0 = 9.3 mag ) , 2011  mm@xmath4 ( @xmath0 = 9.3 mag ) and 2013  lu@xmath5 ( @xmath0 = 8.1 mag ) ; they all move in near - polar orbits .",
    "minor bodies following eccentric , high - inclination paths spend most of the time well beyond the plane of the solar system and away from the destabilizing influence of the giant planets , although close encounters with these planets are still possible at the nodes .    here , we show that , far from being just dynamical curiosities , the three largest retrograde centaurs may be the key to identify the size threshold for catastrophic collisions in the early solar system . on the other hand ,",
    "they are also submitted to retrograde mean motion resonances that make them dynamically unstable , emphasizing the fact that these objects have not remained in their current orbits for long .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we present a comparative statistical analysis of the properties of known prograde and retrograde centaurs that reveals compelling reasons to single out the largest retrograde objects . the current dynamical status of these large retrograde centaurs is studied in sect .",
    "3 , where the numerical model used in our @xmath6-body simulations is also briefly discussed . in sect .",
    "4 , we consider the implications of our results and in sect .",
    "5 we summarize our conclusions .",
    "following alexandersen et al . ( 2013 ) , let us consider the group of minor bodies whose semi - major axes are between 6 and 34 au .",
    "there are 266 such asteroids currently ( as of 2014 may 5 ) in the jpl small - body database .",
    "this number is slightly less than the total number of known centaurs quoted above . out of them ,",
    "236 ( 88.7% ) follow prograde orbits and 30 ( 11.3% ) follow retrograde orbits .",
    "figure [ pro - ret ] shows the distribution in orbital parameter space and @xmath0 of prograde ( left - hand panels ) and retrograde ( right - hand panels ) centaurs . even if the number of known retrograde centaurs is small , it is highly improbable that the two centaur populations have a common origin .",
    "the distribution in absolute magnitude , which is a proxy for size , clearly shows that retrograde centaurs are unlikely to be the result of gravitational scattering of originally prograde centaurs , unless we assume that smaller objects are more efficiently scattered to become retrograde than larger ones ( see the @xmath7- and @xmath8-panels ) or that smaller retrograde objects are easier to identify than their prograde counterparts .",
    "most prograde orbits have eccentricities in the range 0.20.6 and relatively low inclinations , @xmath920 .",
    "the small but noticeable group of prograde orbits with inclination @xmath1063 in fig .",
    "[ pro - ret ] ( left - hand panel ) is consistent with predictions made by e.g. gallardo ( 2006 ) on the existence of objects submitted to the kozai resonance at that critical inclination",
    ". the relative excess of objects with argument of perihelion close to 0or 180could be due to observational bias because only objects with declinations @xmath1124are observed ( see de la fuente marcos and de la fuente marcos 2014 ) .",
    "the raw distribution in @xmath0 of prograde orbits shows evidence of the so called divot or sudden decrease in numbers for @xmath12 9 mag ( or a diameter of nearly 100 km ) as found by e.g. shankman et al .",
    "this has been interpreted by those authors as the relic signature of the size distribution of the primordial planetesimal population , with the larger objects being the remnants .",
    "a divot in the size distribution of trans - neptunian objects was predicted by fraser ( 2009 ) using the results of collisional evolution calculations .",
    "a lack of objects in the size range 120 km was also anticipated by charnoz and morbidelli ( 2007 ) for minor bodies in the scattered disk and the oort cloud .",
    "this feature had been previously identified and confirmed observationally for the size range 2560 km by bernstein et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , fuentes and holman ( 2008 ) , and fraser and kavelaars ( 2009 ) .",
    "this break in the size distribution may signal the onset of collisional evolution .",
    "schlichting et al .",
    "( 2013 ) consider that , for trans - neptunian objects , the observed size distribution above a radius of @xmath1030 km is primordial .",
    "they also found that there is a significant deficit of bodies with size @xmath1010 km and a strong excess of bodies of nearly 2 km in radius ; this excess leaves a permanent signature in the size distribution of these objects that is still clearly observable after 4.5 gyr of collisional evolution .",
    "fraser et al . (",
    "2014 ) have found that the observed size distributions are difficult to explain within the currently accepted standard model of planetesimal formation .    the distribution in @xmath0 for retrograde orbits in fig .",
    "[ pro - ret ] ( left - hand panel ) exhibits a most unusual behaviour .",
    "there are only three objects ( 10% ) with @xmath1 10 mag : ( 342842 ) 2008  yb@xmath3 ( @xmath0 = 9.3 mag ) , 2011  mm@xmath4 ( @xmath0 = 9.3 mag ) and 2013  lu@xmath5 ( @xmath0 = 8.1 mag ) .",
    "the rest have @xmath2 12 mag ( 73.3% have @xmath2 14 mag ) .",
    "although the number of known retrograde centaurs is small , this result can be seen as a dramatic confirmation of the existence of a break in the size distribution as predicted by e.g. fraser ( 2009 ) .",
    "there is an obvious deficit of objects with @xmath0 in the range 1014 mag although they must be significantly easier to detect , if they do indeed exist , than fainter objects of a size below 10 km .",
    "although the available sample is far from complete and likely biased , it should not be biased in favour of 1-km objects against those in the size range 10100 km .",
    "the scarcity of intermediate - size objects must be real and it may have a collisional , dynamical or even primordial origin ( or a combination of the three ) . in principle , and following fraser ( 2009 ) , schlichting et al .",
    "( 2013 ) or shankman et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , some or all the large retrograde centaurs may represent a remnant population of primordial planetesimals .",

    "the brightest ( largest ) objects also appear to be dynamically different .",
    "the distribution of semi - major axes and eccentricities of retrograde objects with @xmath2 12 resembles that of members of the detached or scattered disk populations ( levison and duncan 1997 ; gomes 2011 ) . in terms of the size of their members",

    "asteroid ( 342842 ) 2008  yb@xmath3 will escape towards the trans - neptunian region in the near future and 2013  lu@xmath5 , a recent visitor from the trans - neptunian region , is the first known uranian retrograde co - orbital candidate ( a quasi - satellite ) but further observations are necessary to absolutely confirm that this object is indeed a retrograde companion to uranus .",
    "another interesting feature of the dynamics discussed above is that high - order resonances seem to be preferred by these initial conditions characterized by very high inclinations .",
    "this is , however , not surprising as pointed out by , for example , robutel and laskar ( 2001 ) or gallardo ( 2006 ) . the strength of high - order resonances in general is greater for high - inclination orbits . at high inclination ,",
    "high - order resonances are strong enough to capture objects for relatively long periods of time . in our case ,",
    "the high eccentricities are also a contributing factor to produce stronger dynamical effects ( see e.g. gallardo 2006 ) .",
    "gallardo ( 2006 ) has found that , for a given eccentricity and due to short - period planetary perturbations , high - inclination resonant orbits have a higher probability of survival than low - inclination ones .",
    "this is also consistent with the comparatively weaker stability observed for the retrograde resonances analysed by morais and namouni ( 2013b ) and pointed out above ; the orbits followed by the objects studied in their paper are not almost perpendicular to the ecliptic as in our case and their resonances are low order . in general ,",
    "chaotic diffusion is enhanced for high - inclination , high - eccentricity orbits submitted to high - order resonances .",
    "asteroids 342842 and 2013  lu@xmath5 are not long - term stable but 2011  mm@xmath4 may be considerably more stable . in order to study the long - term stability of 2011  mm@xmath4 we use the regularized mixed variable symplectic ( rmvs ) integrator ( _ swift - rmvs3 _ ) which is part of the swift package ( levison and duncan 1994 ) .",
    "the swift package is available from h. levison web site.hal/swift.html ] the physical model here is similar to the one described in sect .",
    "3 but now the earth and the moon are replaced by the barycentre of the system . the calculations do not consider mercury or any asteroids but they include the barycentre of the pluto - charon system , use a timestep of 50 d and run for @xmath375.0 gyr .",
    "relative errors in the total energy are @xmath48 .",
    "an ejection distance of 10000 au from the sun was used ; any test particle that reached that distance was removed from the calculations . as in the previous simulations , we have followed the evolution of 50 control orbits obtained from the nominal orbital elements of 2011  mm@xmath4 and their quoted uncertainties ( see table [ elements ] ) .",
    "these orbital elements have been sampled within 3@xmath33 from a six - dimensional gaussian distribution around the nominal ones .",
    "results from rmvs and hermite are consistent within the applicable timeframe .",
    "horner et al .",
    "( 2004a , 2004b ) studied the dynamical half - lives of prograde centaurs and found values in the range 0.5432 myr .",
    "the mean half - life of their sample of centaurs was 2.7 myr . for a given orbit , a large number of control orbits , @xmath49 , with parameters close to those of the nominal one were integrated .",
    "these orbits were followed until they resulted in a collision with the sun or the ejection of the test particle from the solar system .",
    "the number of control orbits , @xmath6 , that still remain within the boundaries of the solar system ( in our case , within 10000 au from the sun ) after a time @xmath36 , is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , @xmath17 is the decay constant and @xmath52 is the dynamical half - life of the objects .    using _ swift - rmvs3 _",
    ", we have applied the same approach to 2011  mm@xmath4 in an attempt to study its long - term stability .",
    "asteroid 2011  mm@xmath4 is clearly far more dynamically stable than most centaurs ; its mean dynamical half - life is 23.12 myr .",
    "however , the range in dynamical half - lives forward in time is 5.26310.32 myr and for the past injection into its present orbit is 3.561795.35 myr . in other words ,",
    "this object probably arrived to the region of the giant planets nearly 23 myr ago and certainly not earlier than nearly 2 gyr ago .",
    "therefore , it is not a primordial minor body that has remained around its present location since the formation of the solar system like jovian or martian trojans .",
    "it will be ejected also within 23 myr and not later than 310 myr into the future .    among the control orbits ,",
    "we have found one that is particularly interesting ( @xmath13 = 21.1623 au , @xmath7 = 0.47301 , @xmath8 = 100.446 , @xmath21 = 282.604and @xmath22 = 7.224 , see fig .",

    "it was very long lived into the past ( 1795.35 myr ) and its associated dynamics may signal the presence of a reservoir of asteroids moving in high - inclination prograde orbits that are submitted to a kozai resonance as described by gallardo ( 2006 ) . in fig .",
    "[ control ] , the control orbit begins at a critical inclination of @xmath1063and very high eccentricity .",
    "from there , the eccentricity decreases and the initially prograde orbit turns into a retrograde one . if , somehow , a reservoir of objects moving with orbital inclinations @xmath1063and high eccentricities was created ( and may still survive ) at 200500 au in the remote past , it may be a viable secondary source for retrograde centaurs .",
    "the dynamical evolutionary pathway uncovered by our calculations , even if it has a statistically low probability , shows that the oort cloud is not the only possible source region for retrograde centaurs .",
    "the existence of additional stable reservoirs of rocky and icy bodies at 100300 au can not be simply casted aside .",
    "this interpretation is , however , tentative and should be treated with caution , as there is recent circumstantial evidence on the existence of a massive planet at 250 au from the sun ( trujillo and sheppard 2014 ) . if such planet does indeed exist , the architecture of the entire trans - plutonian region could be very different from the one assumed here , i.e. no truly massive bodies beyond neptune .",
    "a massive perturber in the region 100300 au may affect the dynamical evolution presented in figure [ control ] very significantly .",
    "brasser et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and volk and malhotra ( 2013 ) argued that retrograde or very high inclination centaurs have their origin in the oort cloud .",
    "fouchard et al . ( 2014 ) also pointed out that the oort cloud , and in particular its inner part , is a potential source of high inclination centaurs .",
    "long - period comets are believed to have their origin in the oort cloud ( see e.g. duncan 2008 ) .",
    "halley - type comets may come from the outer edge of the scattered disc ( levison et al .",

    "there are 165 known comets with semi - major axes in the range 634 au .",
    "out of them , 20 objects or 12.1% move in retrograde orbits .",
    "the fractions of retrograde orbits in both groups are more similar than expected by chance alone . in principle",

    "asteroid 2011  mm@xmath4 is a promising candidate to be a representative of a remnant population of primordial planetesimals and it is a good candidate to be submitted to the nodal libration mechanism ( verrier and evans 2008 , 2009 ; farago and laskar 2010 ; doolin and blundell 2011 ) , at least temporarily .",
    "this mechanism , when active , can significantly enhance the stability of near - polar orbits .",
    "minor bodies like 2011  mm@xmath4 may signal the size threshold for catastrophic collisions in the early solar system . returning to the issue of its origin , and as alternative to the oort cloud or the hypothetical high - inclination reservoir pointed out above , we speculate that this and other similar objects may be ancient ejected uranian satellites ( regular or irregular ) . the uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the jovian planets even if the largest one , titania , is the eighth largest moon in the solar system .",
    "uranus rotates nearly on its side with the axis lying nearly in its orbital plane .",
    "uranus large moons follow regular paths in equatorial - plane orbits .",
    "any object originally bound to uranus and tracing an orbit lying nearly in its equatorial plane will follow an almost polar orbit when ejected .",

    "the dynamical evolution of these objects has been subsequently studied using @xmath6-body simulations .",
    "the main conclusions of our work can be summarized as follows :    * the distribution in absolute magnitude of known retrograde centaurs with semi - major axis in the range 634 au exhibits a clear deficit of objects in the range 10 - 14 mag and a significant excess at @xmath1014 mag . * the largest retrograde centaurs move in almost polar , very eccentric paths with their nodal points currently located near perihelion and aphelion . within the retrograde centaur population ,",
    "they are clear outliers both in terms of dynamics and size . *",
    "the largest retrograde centaurs are currently trapped in transient retrograde , mostly high - order , resonances with the jovian planets .",
    "these resonances are strong enough to induce substantial chaotic diffusion and make their orbits dynamically unstable . *",
    "asteroid ( 342842 ) 2008  yb@xmath3 appears to be significantly less dynamically stable than usually assumed . *",
    "asteroid 2011  mm@xmath4 may be a visitor from the oort cloud but an origin in a relatively stable closer reservoir can not be ruled out . *",
    "asteroid 2013  lu@xmath5 is the first known uranian retrograde co - orbital candidate ( a quasi - satellite ) .",
    "* this population may have its origin in the oort cloud but alternative or concurrent sources could be ancient ejected uranian satellites or a hypothetical reservoir of minor bodies moving in high - inclination , high - eccentricity orbits at 200500 au and submitted to the kozai resonance .",
    "our dynamical analysis has been restricted to just three objects and their associated orbital parameter space . however ,",
    "a number of distinctive properties that should be common to any retrograde centaurs have been identified .",
    "in particular , the role of high - order resonances at high inclination as anticipated by gallardo ( 2006 ) seems to be determinant on the short - term evolution of this population .",
