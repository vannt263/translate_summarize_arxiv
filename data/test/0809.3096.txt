    "in this paper we demonstrate that the profile of angular distribution of electrons emitted in the process of a single - photon ionization from a strongly polarizable target ( in particular , a metal cluster anion ) exposed to a laser field can be noticeably modified due to the action of the field @xmath2 of alternating dipole moment @xmath3 induced at the residue by the laser field .",
    "the field @xmath2 acts on the escaping electron and , being dependent on the polarization vector of the laser field , brings additional dependence of the cross section on the emission angle . the degree of this dependence",
    "is determined by the magnitude of @xmath3 which , in turn , is proportional to the residue s dynamic polarizability .",
    "therefore , for a target with large polarizability the effect can be very pronounced even for laser fields of low intensities .",
    "the effect of the laser - field  induced dipole moment in atomic photoionization process was discussed in @xcite ( where one finds also the references to the earlier works by the authors ) and , more recently , in @xcite .",
    "both papers were devoted to the study of _ multiphoton _ detachment of electrons from atomic negative ions . in @xcite",
    "the process was analyzed by means of the perturbation theory .",
    "numerical analysis was carried out for halogen and alkali metal anions , and it demonstrated , that the induced dipole moment influences the magnitude of total cross section of the many - photon detachment . the paper @xcite dealt with the process of a _ strong - field _ many - photon detachment of an atomic anion .",
    "the non - perturbative adiabatic theory , developed in @xcite , was modified to account for the field of the induced dipole moment .",
    "the numerical calculations , performed for rb@xmath4 and cs@xmath4 , showed the increase of the detachment rate and essential modification of the angular distribution .    in our paper",
    "we investigate the influence of the induced dipole moment on the angular and spectral distributions of photoelectrons in the process of _ single - photon _ ionization ( or detachment ) occurring in the _ weak - field _ regime .",
    "numerical results are presented for sodium cluster anions na@xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding residue clusters are characterized by large values of the dynamic dipole polarizability @xmath7 , which in the vicinity of plasmon resonances , i.e. at @xmath8 ev , can be as large as @xmath9 a.u . , which by far exceed the maximum values of @xmath7 of individual atoms ( e.g. , @xmath10 a.u . for cs at the photon energy 0.47 ev @xcite ) .",
    "we demonstrate that dramatic changes to the profile of angular distribution occur in vicinities of the plasmon resonances and for comparatively low intensities @xmath11 w/@xmath1 of the laser field .",
    "these are exactly the ranges used in recent experimental studies @xcite of the photodetachment from various metal cluster anions carried out by means of angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , the experimental test of the predicted effects seems to be feasible .    the atomic system of units , @xmath12 is used throughout the paper .",
    "consider the process of photoionization of a strongly polarizable target ( a cluster , a fullerene , a complex molecule , etc ) by spatially homogenous linearly polarized laser field @xmath13 we assume , that the field wavelength @xmath14 greatly exceeds the characteristic size @xmath15 of the target , @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the process can be treated within the dipole - photon limit .",
    "the laser field ionizes the target and polarizes the residue .",
    "therefore , in addition to other fields ( the static potential of the residue , the long - range polarizational potential ) the escaping photoelectron feels the field due to the oscillating dipole moment @xmath3 induced at the residue : @xmath17    to simplify the consideration we assume , that the residue is spherically symmetric , so that its tensor of polarizability contains only a scalar part which is notated as @xmath7 .",
    "then , the moment @xmath3 reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the field of the induced dipole can be written as follows : @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "this field is dependent on the direction of @xmath22 , therefore , the angular distribution of photoelectrons acquires additional dependence on the polarization of the laser field .",
    "the degree of this dependence is determined by the magnitude of @xmath3 , which is proportional to the residue dynamic dipole polarizability .",
    "hence , for a target with large polarizability the modification of the angular distribution due to the induced dipole moment can become noticeable even for a laser field of a comparatively low intensity .",
    "let us clearly state the conditions which we impose on the parameters of the laser field .",
    "these include the following inequalities : @xmath23 the first condition implies that the laser field strength is much smaller than the strength @xmath24 of the internal field in the target .",
    "this condition allows one to ignore the laser field when constructing the wavefunction of the bound electron with the binding energy @xmath25 .",
    "numerical results presented in section [ numericalresults ] refer to the laser field strength @xmath26 v / cm .",
    "the second condition states that the energy @xmath27 of the escaping electron is large compared to the ponderomotive shift due to the wiggling in the laser field .",
    "owing to this condition we do not `` dress '' the photoelectron wavefunction with the laser field .",
    "the last inequality in ( [ conditions ] ) indicates that the photon energy exceeds the ionization threshold of the bound electron .",
    "therefore , the process of a _ single - photon _ ionization is allowed for which the energy conservation law reads @xmath28    combining the conditions ( i ) and ( iii ) one demonstrates that the following inequality is met : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a so - called keldysh parameter , and @xmath31 .",
    "the limit @xmath32 defines a weak field regime ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in this paper we investigate the influence of the induced dipole moment @xmath3 on the angular and spectral distributions of photoelectrons in the process of _ single - photon _ ionization ( or detachment ) occurring in the weak field regime .",
    "earlier the role of @xmath3 was studied in the process of many - photon detachment ( i.e. , when @xmath33 ) from atomic negative ions .",
    "it was done in the weak - field @xcite and in the strong - field @xcite limits .",
    "let us note , that the weak field condition ( ii ) does not immediately imply the applicability of the perturbative approach with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , from ( [ problem.2])-([problem2.3a ] ) follows that @xmath34 exceeds @xmath35 by a factor @xmath36 . for a strongly polarizable target",
    "this factor can be large enough in a wide range of radial distances @xmath37 , and this might lead to a non - perturbative treatment of the action of @xmath2 .    to carry out a quantitative analysis",
    "we first postulate that under certain conditions the field ( [ problem2.3a ] ) can be considered as a time - dependent perturbation which modifies the wavefunction of the escaping electron .",
    "the criterion of applicability of this approach will be formulated in the course of calculations .",
    "the matrix element @xmath38 , which describes a dipole - photon transition of the electron from the initial bound state @xmath39 to the final state @xmath40 with the asymptotic momentum @xmath41 and energy @xmath42 , can be written in the following form : @xmath43 the right - hand side of this equation represents the power series in @xmath2 .",
    "the structure of the terms of the series is illustrated by diagrams in figure [ diagram.fig ] .",
    "( indicated with the dashed vertical lines ) .",
    "the double line represents the initial bound state .",
    "the solid line stands for the escaping electron whose wavefunction is `` dressed '' with all static fields . ]",
    "the zeroth order term @xmath44 describes the direct process of photoionization standing for the matrix element of the operator @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 we assume that the wavefunction @xmath48 ( whose asymptotic form is the plane wave + the incoming wave ) corresponds to the state `` dressed '' with all _ static _ fields .",
    "the delta - function on the right - hand side of ( [ m0.1 ] ) expresses the energy conservation law ( [ m0.3 ] ) .",
    "the terms @xmath49 with @xmath50 are the corrections to the transition amplitude due to the @xmath51-times interaction of the photoelectron with @xmath2 . since this field explicitly depends on @xmath52 ( see ( [ problem2.3a ] ) ) then in each act of the interaction the electron energy is changed ( increased or decreased ) by @xmath53 . as a result ,",
    "not all terms on the right - hand side of ( [ problem.3 ] ) represent the correction to the direct amplitude @xmath44 , which implies the validity of ( [ m0.3 ] ) .",
    "for example , evaluating @xmath54 ( the second diagram in figure [ diagram.fig ] ) one finds , that it contains the terms proportional to @xmath55 and to @xmath56 , which conflict with the conservation law ( [ m0.3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the term @xmath54 must be ignored when constructing the correction to @xmath44 .",
    "the lowest - order correction originates from the amplitude @xmath57 ( the last diagram in figure [ diagram.fig ] ) , which contains the terms proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "applying the standard technique of the time - dependent perturbation theory , one derives the following expression for this contribution : @xmath59 where @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the green s function of the photoelectron and @xmath62 is the unit vector of the laser field polarization .",
    "hence , within the second second order perturbation theory in @xmath2 , the photoionization amplitude is written as : @xmath63    using the amplitude ( [ ampl.1 ] ) one can write the following expression for the spectra - angular distribution : @xmath64 here @xmath65 stands for the differential cross section calculated without the influence of the induced dipole moment . within the dipole - photon approximation",
    "the differential cross section @xmath66 can be presented in the well - known general form ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the total cross section of photoionization , @xmath69 stands for the angle between @xmath41 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the legendre polynomial of the second order .",
    "the quantity @xmath72 stands for the angular asymmetry parameter @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath73 defines the profile of the angular distribution .",
    "equation ( [ cs.3 ] ) indicates , that the profile is modified by the factor @xmath74 , when the field ( [ problem2.3a ] ) is taken into account .",
    "the correction term @xmath75 is defined as follows : @xmath76    formula ( [ cs.3 ] ) was obtained by means of the perturbation theory .",
    "thus , it is implied that the absolute value of the correction term satisfies the condition @xmath77 .",
    "if otherwise , the field @xmath2 must be accounted for in all orders of the perturbation series ( [ problem.3 ] ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ ampl.3 ] ) , that @xmath75 is proportional to the squared induced dipole moment , @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , for a target of a small polarizability , one has to apply very intensive laser fields in order to achieve a noticeable correction to the photoelectron angular distribution , i.e. @xmath79 .",
    "on the contrary , for a strongly polarizable target ( e.g. , a metallic cluster or / and its anion ) a strong effect can be expected for laser fields of a moderate strength . in section [ numericalresults ]",
    "we demonstrate , that dramatic change of the angular distribution profile can occur for @xmath80 v / cm .",
    "it is important to note , that the correction term ( [ cs.5 ] ) depends on the ratio of the amplitudes @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "thus , one can expect that it is less sensitive to the approximation chosen to describe the photoelectron wavefunction than the cross section @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , to estimate the influence of the target polarization one can calculate @xmath75 within the framework of a comparatively simple approximation , which is described below .",
    "in this section we derive an approximate expression for the correction term @xmath75 using a simple , although realistic and physically clear , model .    to start with",
    "let us assume , that the ionized target is a spherically - symmetric anion . then , firstly , the ground state wavefunction @xmath84 does not depend on the angles of the position vector : @xmath85 .",
    "secondly , the wavefunction @xmath86 of the photoelectron does not contain the contribution of a long - range coulomb field of the residue .",
    "these assumptions , being not of a principal nature , allow one to simplify the intermediate algebra .",
    "making use of the partial wave expansion @xmath87 where @xmath88 are the spherical harmonics , @xmath89 are the scattering phaseshift , and @xmath90 are the radial wavefunctions , one writes the amplitude @xmath82 in the following form : @xmath91    another simplification is based on the approximation that the field @xmath2 acts on the escaping electron only outside the target , i.e. at the distances @xmath92 .",
    "additionally , one can assume , that the wavefunction @xmath93 is concentrated in the interior of the target , i.e. at @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , when evaluating the right - hand side of ( [ ampl.3 ] ) one takes into account that @xmath95 .",
    "this allows one to relate @xmath81 to the amplitude @xmath82 . to do this",
    "let us approximate the green s function @xmath96 as follows : @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the largest / smallest of @xmath99 , @xmath100 stands for the irregular solutions of the radial schrdinger equation for the energy @xmath42 .",
    "the quantity @xmath101 is the exact radial green s function corresponding to the multipolarity @xmath102 .",
    "the first equality in ( [ longdistance.2 ] ) states the partial - wave expansion of the green s function .",
    "the approximate equality is based on the assumption @xmath103 .    using ( [ longdistance.2 ] ) in ( [ ampl.3 ] ) one notices that the radial integral over @xmath104 reduces to that from ( [ m0_born.1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the amplitude @xmath81 acquires the form : @xmath105 with @xmath106 here the integration is carried out over the spatial region @xmath107 .",

    "the ratio @xmath116 reduces to @xmath117 with the help of the recurrence relation for the legendre polynomials .",
    "the quantities @xmath118 stand for the following radial integrals : @xmath119 for any realistic target the exact evaluation of these integrals can be done by numerical means only , implying the computation of the regular @xmath90 and the irregular @xmath120 functions as well as of the green s functions @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "to carry out the approximate integration one can substitute these quantities with the leading terms of their asymptotic representations . for @xmath90 and @xmath120",
    "this results in @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",

    "@xmath130 this quantity reads as @xmath131 .    by using the asymptotic formulae one carries out analytical evaluation of the integrals from ( [ longdistance1.5a ] ) . the final result ( the leading term ) for @xmath132 is as follows : @xmath133 _ { l=1,3 \\atop l^{\\prime}=0,2 } , \\label{functionb3.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "it follows from the approximations formulated above , that formula ( [ functionb3.3 ] ) is valid if the photoelectron momentum @xmath137 and the ground state energy @xmath138 satisfy the conditions : @xmath139    letting @xmath140 in ( [ functionb3.3 ] ) one finds the plane - wave born limit of @xmath132 .",
    "the presence of oscillatory terms on the right - hand side of ( [ functionb3.3 ] ) is physically clear . indeed , in the limit @xmath141 the wavelength of the photoelectron is less than the size of the target , which is supposed to have a well - pronounced edge ( e.g. , the edge of an ionic core in a cluster ) .",
    "thus , the electron experiences a diffraction at the edge when leaving the core .",
    "this diffraction leads to the oscillatory character of the cross section .",
    "this phenomenon was discussed previously in connection with various processes involving metallic clusters and fullerenes : the radiative electron capture by metallic clusters @xcite , the electron scattering @xcite , the polarizational bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "carrying out obvious summations in ( [ longdistance1.5 ] ) , one writes correction factor as follows : @xmath142 where @xmath143    formula ( [ correctionfactor2.1 ] ) stresses the proportionality of @xmath75 to the laser field intensity ( which is proportional to @xmath144 ) and exhibits explicitly its dependence on the emission angle @xmath69 , which enters , as well as in ( [ cs.4a ] ) , via the second order legendre polynomial .    as a function of @xmath69 the modulus of @xmath75 attains its maximum either at @xmath145 ( and @xmath146 ) or at @xmath147 , depending on the sign of the product @xmath148 and on the relative magnitudes of @xmath149 and @xmath150 . for further reference",

    "the model potential , which was used to describe the interaction between the photoelectron and the neutral residue , accounted for the following three terms : ( a ) the short - range potential due to the coulomb interaction with the core s electrons and the ionic jellium core , ( b ) the exchange - correlation term , which was treated within the gunnarsson - lundqvist approximation @xcite , ( c ) the polarization potential was considered in the form @xmath203 for @xmath37 and @xmath204 if otherwise .",

    ".    in the limit @xmath241 the modified profile behaves as @xmath278 .",

    "these conditions can be satisfied in the limit @xmath281 for all considered anions but na@xmath276 .",
    "most explicitly it is seen in na@xmath192 and na@xmath200 graphs , where the curves with @xmath282 represent the four - petal angular distributions with the maximum emission at @xmath283 and @xmath284 .",
    "the same pattern characterizes na@xmath285 , although in this case it is hardly visible due to a strong decrease in the magnitude of @xmath286 for @xmath282 .",

    "the data refer to the laser field intensity @xmath287 w/@xmath1 . ]    finally , let us briefly discuss the influence of the induced dipole moment on the cross section integrated over the emission angles . recalling ( [ modification2.3 ] ) and ( [ modification2.9 ] ) , one finds the following formula for the ratio of the cross sections with , @xmath288 , and without , @xmath289 , account for the correction : @xmath290 figure [ spectra.fig ] presents the ratios @xmath291 versus @xmath53 . for each anion",
    "the ratio was calculated using the dependences @xmath149 and @xmath149 , presented in figures [ na08_40.fig ] and [ na58_92.fig ] , and for three values of the asymmetry parameter ( as indicated ) .",
    "the intensity of the laser field was set to @xmath287 w/@xmath1 , which corresponds to the field strength @xmath292 a.u . comparing the latter value to the critical field @xmath218 ( see figures [ na08_40.fig ] and [ na58_92.fig ] ) one notices , that for all targets and in the whole range of @xmath53 the parameter @xmath293 is less than one .",
    "thus , formula ( [ spectra.1 ] ) is applicable for the quantitative estimate of the correction due to the induced moment .",
    "as one can see from figure [ spectra.fig ] , the largest deviation ( up to @xmath294 ) of @xmath288 from @xmath289 occurs for na@xmath285 and na@xmath200 in the vicinities of the plasmon resonances , where @xmath267 reaches its maximum values : @xmath295 for na@xmath285 and @xmath296 for na@xmath200 . in the case of na@xmath200",
    "a strong inequality @xmath297 is valid ( see figure [ na58_92.fig ] or / and table [ nan.table2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of the correction term from the right - hand side of ( [ spectra.1 ] ) becomes sensitive to the choice of the asymmetry parameter . as a result",
    ", the ratio @xmath298 strongly varies with @xmath156 . on the contrary , for na@xmath285",
    "the relation @xmath299 is valid , leading to a weak dependence of the ratio on @xmath156 .    for the anions na@xmath192 and na@xmath199 the largest values of @xmath267 equal to 0.05 and 0.15 , correspondingly .",
    "hence , the intensity @xmath300 is small compared to @xmath301 . as a result , the deviation of @xmath288 from the field - free value @xmath289 is less pronounced .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that the dipole moment , induced at the residue by the incoming laser field , can strongly influence the photoionization process .",
    "the additional time - dependent long - range field due to the induced moment , acting on the escaping electron , modifies the spectral - angular and spectral distributions of photoelectrons .",
    "the effect itself , as well as its quantitative treatment , is quite sensitive to the choice of the target and to the parameters of the laser field .",
    "we have demonstrated , that for a strongly polarizable target ( e.g. , metallic cluster anions ) strong modifications of the characteristics of a single - photon ionization process in the vicinity of the plasmon resonance ( typically , @xmath302 ev ) can be achieved by applying laser fields of comparatively low intensities @xmath0 w/@xmath1 .    from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the advantage of this regime is that the field of induced dipole moment can be treated perturbatively , whereas the influence of the laser field on the photoelectron ( a ponderomotive effect ) and on the ground state of the target can be ignored .",
    "we have shown , that even in this weak - field regime one can expect dramatic changes in the profile of angular distribution of photoelectrons as well as in the @xmath53 dependence of the photoionization cross section . to a great extent , these changes depend on the parameters of the target , like its radius , the static and dynamic polarizabilities , the energy of the plasmon resonance peak and the affinity ( or , the ionization potential in the case of a neutral target ) .",
    "additional variety can be obtained by changing the intensity and the frequency of the laser field .",
    "the analysis , which we have carried out , is based on simple models adopted for the description of the photodetachment process ( the plasmon resonance approximation ) and of the interaction of the escaping electron with the static field of the residue ( via the lda + long - range polarization potential ) .",
    "we have also restricted ourselves to the case of spherically - symmetric targets .",
    "a more accurate quantitative treatment must include more sophisticated approaches , which take into account the many - body correlation effects intrinsic to both the photodetachment and the electron escape . however , these will leave untouched the physics behind the basic phenomenon discussed in our paper .",
    "it is possible to study the predicted phenomena by means of modern experimental techniques .",
    "the latter include the production and manipulation of the beams of cluster anions of various types and sizes , the energy and angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy , the availability of the laser fields of various intensity , frequency and pulse duration @xcite .",
    "we believe , that with all these components at hand , soon it will become possible to test the theory against experimental data .",
