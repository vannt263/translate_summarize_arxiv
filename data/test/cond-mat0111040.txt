    "the ability to coherently transfer atoms out of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a trapped atomic gas is of fundamental importance in the creation of coherent matter wave generators , often called `` atom lasers '' .",
    "theoretical interest has developed toward characterizing the out - coupling stage of such an atom laser , with the hope of developing efficiency criteria for this process .",
    "all this work has been done in the zero temperature limit , using either a non - interacting gas coupled to a laser mode @xcite or the modified gross - pitaevskii dynamics of the condensate order parameter @xcite .",
    "a complete understanding of the out - coupling process necessarily must take into account the presence of the thermal cloud composed of noncondensate atoms .",
    "recently , the role that the noncondensate atoms play in the out - coupling process has been discussed by japha , choi , burnett and band @xcite . in their work ,",
    "a `` pair - breaking '' contribution was obtained , in which a correlated pair of atoms take part in the output process , with one output atom appearing simultaneously with the creation of an excitation in the trapped bose gas .",
    "out - coupling experiments are only a small class of experiments that can be performed in which a bec is coupled to another gas of atoms ( that may or may not be bose - condensed ) .",
    "the mit group @xcite has performed work in which a bec is scattered from an optical bragg grating .",
    "they show that the excitation spectrum of the scattered atoms gives a direct experimental measure of the dynamic structure factor of the initial bose - condensate .",
    "since the detailed form of the dynamic structure factor @xmath2 is dependent upon the many - body correlations of the bose - condensate , this kind of experiment provides a means of probing the unique correlations induced by a bose - condensate @xcite .    despite the large amount of work that has been performed with regard to the coupling of bose - condensed gases with another ( possibly bose - condensed ) gas ,",
    "there still does not exist in the literature a clean formulation of such a coupling .",
    "even though refs.@xmath3@xcite have sparked interest in this issue , the formalism used in these papers does not show in a transparent way which correlations present in a bose - condensed gas can be probed by such experiments .",
    "moreover , the case in which both trapped gases are bose - condensed was not considered .    in this paper , we set up a general linear response theory approach for treating the coupling of two bose gases at finite temperatures , which gives a formally exact expression for the tunneling current .",
    "the general expressions we derive  within linear response theory  are independent of the specific approximation used for the many - body states of the two uncoupled , trapped bose gases . in this sense , our results are the analogue of showing how the inelastic neutron scattering cross - section is related to the dynamic structure factor @xcite and the general theory of tunneling in superconductors @xcite .",
    "the work closest to ours is by meier and zwerger @xcite , who applied a similar formalism in discussing coherent josephson tunneling between two uniform bose - condensed gases . in sections [ section : linear response theory - general ] and [ section : tunneling currents in terms of correlations functions ] ,",
    "we give a detailed account of the many - body theory needed to find formal expressions for the tunneling currents in terms of single - atom correlation functions .",
    "we apply our theoretical formalism to a class of experiments involving raman scattering of atoms between trapped bose gases .",
    "we calculate the tunneling current expression at finite temperatures using the bogoliubov - popov approximation for the single - particle excitations in the trapped bose gases @xcite .",
    "we discuss coherent tunneling of atoms between two bose - condensed gases , as well as the out - coupling of atoms from a bec in a trap to the vacuum ( i.e. ,  to free particle states ) . in this latter case , as expected , we show that our more general formalism reproduces the results of refs.@xmath3@xcite in the appropriate limit . in section [ sec : lda ] , we give an explicit calculation of the out - coupling current based on treating the noncondensed atoms within a simple local density approximation ( lda ) , such as used in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in essence , we show that besides the dominant contribution from tunneling of atoms out of the condensate , one finds a much smaller contribution which arises from the atoms tunneling out of the noncondensate .",
    "this latter contribution , however , is of special interest since it is directly related to the single - particle correlation function of the noncondensate atoms .",
    "one component has weight proportional to the bogoliubov amplitude @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the bose - distribution function for an excitation of energy @xmath6 , and increases with temperature . the other , more interesting , component has weight proportional to the bogoliubov amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "this latter process is formally related to the `` negative energy pole '' of the bogoliubov spectral density .",
    "this so - called `` pair - breaking '' term @xcite is of interest as a unique signature of the unusual correlations induced by a bose condensate .",
    "it corresponds to the out - coupling of an atom and the simultaneous creation of a bogoliubov excitation in the trapped gas .",
    "this contribution already is present at zero temperature and , in contrast to the tunneling current from the condensate , contributes to an output tunneling current of atoms with a wide spectrum of energies . as the temperature increases",
    ", the weight of the @xmath8 term decreases while the @xmath9 term starts to build up ( we recall that as the condensate density goes to zero , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the analogue of this pair - breaking process was discussed earlier in the context of a bose - condensed gas of excitons @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our work , a proposal has recently been put forward @xcite to measure these bogoliubov amplitudes using an optical bragg scattering technique . in this approach",
    ", a two - photon bragg scattering beam is used to excite quasiparticles out of the condensate and then a second bragg beam is used to probe the altered momentum distribution of the sample .",
    "recent work at mit has beautifully verified these predictions @xcite .",
    "unlike this situation , in the raman scattering experiment the energy absorbed by the atoms imparts a momentum kick in addition to causing a change of hyperfine state , allowing the scattered atom to no longer be trapped .",
    "our results give another fairly direct method of measuring the bogoliubov quasiparticle amplitudes . furthermore , since the weight of the out - coupling current is proportional to the bogoliubov amplitude @xmath1 , it is significantly amplified for larger values of the s - wave scattering length @xmath12 such as can be achieved by working close to a feshbach resonance .",
    "we hope our work further stimulates experimental interest in this kind of out - coupling experiment , even though the current from the noncondensate atoms is quite small compared to that from the condensate .",
    "our goal is to calculate the current of atoms tunneling between two atomic gases coupled through a weak external field , which can be treated as a time - dependent perturbation to a time - independent many - body hamiltonian using linear response theory ( see , for example , refs.@xmath3@xcite ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian in the schrdinger representation is@xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hamiltonian for the many - body systems , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the atomic hyperfine level energies of an atom in gas 1 and gas 2 respectively , @xmath17 is the atomic number operator for gas 1(2 ) , given by@xmath18 the external probe field @xmath19 is explicitly time - dependent .",
    "we assume that the two many - body systems do not interact with one another in the absence of @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 .",
    "this amounts to assuming that the two gases do not overlap , _",
    "_ _ the coupling term of the kind @xmath22 can be neglected . in the absence of @xmath19 ,",
    "the number of atoms in the two systems is fixed by their chemical potentials @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the tunneling perturbation @xmath19 couples the two many - body systems together by introducing a mechanism by which an atom can tunnel between the two systems .",
    "this perturbation has terms which create an atom in one system while destroying an atom in the other system , and vice - versa .",
    "an example of the kind of experiment described by the tunneling perturbation @xmath19 is the out - coupling phenomenon considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "an external electromagnetic ( em ) field causes transitions between two atomic hyperfine levels , one of which is not trapped .",
    "we label the quantum states corresponding to these hyperfine levels by @xmath25 and @xmath26 . assuming that hyperfine level @xmath25 is lower in energy than hyperfine level @xmath26",
    ", energy will be absorbed from ( emitted to ) the external field facilitating the transition @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) . in more general experiments",
    ", however , the transition can take place between two atomic hyperfine levels that are both trapped .",
    "an example of such a process is a stimulated raman transition between the magnetic hyperfine levels @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( for a detailed discussion , see ref .",
    "we will return to the specifics of a bec coupling experiment in section [ section : coupling between two trapped gases ] when we calculate the tunneling current between two trapped bose - condensed gases .    for the moment it suffices to write down the semiclassical form of the tunneling perturbation @xmath20 arising from the electric - dipole and rotating wave approximations @xcite , @xmath31 here",

    "in particular , one can `` tune '' the scattering length @xmath12 significantly by the use of feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "the amplification of the out - coupling current of atoms associated with the negative energy poles of the single - particle noncondensate green s function could be looked for in trapped gases near a feshbach resonance .",
    "out - coupling experiments may thus provide important information about the bose - condensed gas excitation spectrum if we can increase the s - wave scattering length substantially . in this case , of course , we expect observable changes from the simple bogoliubov - popov approximation we introduced in section [ section : coupling between two trapped gases ] for the single - particle spectral density .",
    "such many - body effects can thus be probed `` directly '' using the out - coupling kind of experiment we have been discussing .",
    "this paper has studied the weak coupling of two trapped dilute bose gases using a tunneling hamiltonian approach .",

    "the expression in ( [ equilibrium current 3 ] ) , which corresponds to coherent transfer of atoms between two condensates , is first order in the coupling @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , we found that two types of quasiparticle currents emerge from treating a perturbation of the kind shown in ( [ v ] ) to second order : a static , time - independent current given by ( [ deltaina ] ) and ( [ short time normal current ] ) involving only regular correlation functions of the form @xmath332 , and a time - dependent current given by ( [ deltaiaa ] ) and ( [ deltaiab ] ) involving a second harmonic with frequency @xmath333 .",
    "the latter is associated with anomalous correlation functions of the kind @xmath334 , and is reminiscent of the josephson current carried by cooper pairs in superconductors @xcite .",
    "these tunneling currents were written in terms of single - particle spectral density functions that contain all the details of the microscopic correlations of the bose - condensed gases . in this manner ,",
    "the tunneling dynamics is cleanly _ separated _ from the specific approximation used for the many - body description of the bose - condensed gas .",

    "the present paper thus provides a foundation upon which one can study the details of different tunneling processes within various many - body approximations for the dynamics of a bose gas .",
    "our work re - emphasizes the potential usefulness of the kind of out - coupling experiments discussed in refs.@xmath3@xcite as a probe of the many - body physics of a bose - condensed gas , including systems of reduced dimensionality .",

    "@xcite ) probes the single - particle green s function of a trapped bose gas , which is perhaps a more basic measure of the condensate - induced correlations between atoms .    for illustration ,",
    "we have used our formalism in sections [ section : coupling between two trapped gases ] and [ sec : case of out - coupling to a non - bose - condensed gas ] to find a general expression for the out - coupling atom current using the bogoliubov - popov quasiparticle approximation .",
    "our results exhibit the same three processes obtained by the oxford group @xcite .",
    "the first process is the tunneling of an atom out of the condensate of the trapped gas .",
    "the second process is the `` quantum evaporation '' of an atom from the trapped gas , _ destroying _ a quasiparticle excitation in the trapped gas and _ creating _ an atom in the out - coupled gas .",
    "the third process , referred to as a `` pair - breaking '' process in ref .",
    "@xcite , involves an atom tunneling out of the trapped gas concurrently with the _ creation _ of a quasiparticle excitation in the trapped gas ( see also ref .",

    ", we have numerically evaluated the relative contributions of these three processes as a function of the laser detuning parameter @xmath335 , for various values of the wavevector difference between the two laser beams @xmath336 and the temperature @xmath273 .",
    "this kind of experiment would be especially promising as a probe of the correlations in a bose gas in the case of a large scattering length @xmath12 made possible by working near a feshbach resonance .",
    "this enhances the tunneling contribution from the noncondensate atoms and moreover requires the use of an improved single - particle correlation function which includes quantum depletion of the condensate ( such as the second order beliaev approximation ) .",
    "the tunneling currents from the noncondensate atoms are admittedly small and will require high precision experiments .",
    "we argue that the unique information that can be obtained justifies the effort . in future work",
