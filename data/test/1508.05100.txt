    "this paper is part of the bocce ( bologna open clusters chemical evolution ) project , described in detail by @xcite .",
    "bocce aims to precisely and homogeneously derive the fundamental properties of a large , significant sample of open clusters ( ocs ) , which are among the best tracers of the galactic disc properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have already analysed photometric data for 35 ocs ( see * ? ? ? * for updated references ) , by comparing observed and synthetic colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds , see @xcite ) and producing age , distance , reddening , and approximate metallicity on a homogenous scale .",
    "metallicity and detailed chemical abundances based on high - resolution spectroscopy are instead available for about one third of the sample , see e.g. @xcite , and @xcite for a discussion on the use of ocs to ascertain the metallicity distribution in the disc .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     m08=@xcite , s00=@xcite    [ conf ]    to derive the cluster s properties , @xcite combined spectra obtained with elodie on the 1.93 m telescope at the ohp with the @xcite photometry , 2mass data , and proper motions .",
    "they obtained spectra of 24 stars , both evolved and at the msto ; 17 turned out to be member on the basis of their rv .",
    "the eight stars near the msto have high rotational velocities ; the average rv defined by the nine giants is 35.13 ( rms=0.39 ) km  @xmath7 , also in agreement with our values .",
    "@xcite used tgmet , a software which finds the best matching template in a library , to derive atmospheric parameters and absolute magnitude of the stars ( see their fig .  7 and table  2 ) .",
    "we observed three stars in common and table  [ conf ] shows that there is a satisfactory agreement between our studies .",
    "@xcite observed ngc  2355 with the multiobject spectrograph hydra at the 3.5 m wyin telescope on kitt peak ; the resolution was about 18000 and the wavelength coverage about 300  , centred at 6280  .",
    "they obtained spectra for a dozen stars , half of which were found member ( see their paper for details and for comparison with previous results , usually -but not - always- in good agreement ) .",
    "abundance analysis was based on ews and synthesis , using moog @xcite . finally , @xcite observed three of these stars with the echelle spectrograph on the kpno 4 m telescope .",
    "none of our three stars is in common with these two studies .",
    "however , the average temperatures and gravities are 4975 , 2.97 and 5200 , 2.95 for the four rc stars in @xcite and the two rc stars in @xcite , respectively , compared to our average values of 5062 , 2.64 .",
    "we present in table  [ conf2 ] a comparison between our average abundance ratios and those in @xcite and @xcite for the species in common .",
    "the metallicity agrees very well , whereas we find differences of the order of 0.1 dex for the light , @xmath6 , and iron - peak elements ( given only in @xcite ) .",
    "this is a common occurrence when comparing inhomogenoeus analyses and can be due to many factors such as different solar reference values ( as in the cases of na and ca , where this would explain fully the offsets ) , different choice of lines , @xmath8 , temperatures , etc .",
    "given the small offests , we do not explore further these cases .",
    "very large discrepancies are found instead for the three neutron - capture elements",
    "zr , ba , and eu ; conversely , there is a very good agreement for the lanthanum abundances .",
    "this deserve investigation .",
    "unfortunately , we have no stars in common , thus a direct comparison is hampered .    for zr",
    ", we found a ratio of [ zr / fe]=@xmath90.18 to be compared to [ zr / fe]=+0.49 by @xcite , implying a difference of 0.67 dex ( more than a factor of four ) .",
    "we can only partially explain such a large disagreement in terms of the adopted atomic parameters .",
    "those authors discussed that their oscillator strengths results in a solar zr abundance larger than all literature estimates by @xmath10 0.3 - 0.4 dex ( see that paper for details ) .",
    "however , for zr  i lines in common with that study the average differences in log@xmath11 values are approximately 0.15 dex , so that they can not account for the discrepancy .",
    "it is noteworthy that our zr abundances from neutral and single - ionised lines do agree very well , suggesting that the different ionisation stage of the lines under scrutiny is not responsible for the mismatch .",
    "on the other hand , we note also that in @xcite there is a large scatter from different zr  i lines for two of the three stars , with values ranging from + 0.19 to + 0.60 , and from + 0.59 to + 0.92 , respectively .",
    "this seem to suggest that the [ zr / fe ] ratios could be quite uncertain and must be taken with caution .    the @xmath12-process element eu presents a difference ( in the sense ours minus @xcite ) of @xmath90.33 dex , which is beyond measurement errors .",
    "while from our data the eu content is very homogeneous within the cluster , @xcite detected significant internal variations , finding a difference between star # 144 and stars # 398 , 668 of a factor of two and four , respectively , in their [ eu / fe ] ratios .",
    "these differences seem due to one of the two lines they used ; had they relied only on the same line we also are using ( 6645  ) , results would have been much more homogenous and more similar to our values ( however , this line has been measured only in two of the three stars ) .",
    "since open clusters are not known to host any intrinsic internal variations in terms of chemical composition , we are tempted to conclude that our analysis and the use of the best line is more robust .",
    "finally , given its peculiar pattern observed in open cluster stars , ba deserves a more detailed discussion .",
    "first identified by @xcite , and subsequently confirmed by several different studies ( e.g. , @xcite , see discussion in section 6 ) , there is a trend of decreasing ba abundances as a function of the open cluster s age , with younger clusters exhibiting [ ba / fe ] ratios up to @xmath10 0.6 dex ( such as e.g. , the case of ic  2602 and ic  2391 by @xcite ) , whereas solar ratios are measured for clusters a few gyr old . considering the age of ngc  2355 , and values reported in the literature for almost coeval clusters",
    ", we should expect enhancements in the ba content at levels of approximately 0.25@xmath90.40 dex , which is not evident from the present analysis .",
    "in fact , our average mean abundance results in a solar [ ba / fe ] ratio of 0.05@xmath130.08 dex ( 0.53 dex lower than jacobson s study ) . the different techniques and approaches",
    "could in principle explain this large discrepancy ; for instance , equivalent width analysis has been carried out by @xcite and @xcite , whereas here we performed spectral syntheses .",
    "critical in this respect is also the microturbulence value , because ba  ii lines sit on the saturated part of the curve of growth and they are quite insensitive to the abundance .",
    "given the quite limited sample , we can not certainly state that this cluster presents an anomalously low ba content ( considering its age ) or , conversely",
    ", measurement errors cause this trend . homogeneous analysis of all the data , or of a similarly large sample of clusters , should be attempted , to clarify this issue .",
    "to complete our analysis of ngc  2355 , the age , distance modulus , reddening ( total and differential ) , and binary fraction of the cluster are estimated using the synthetic cmd technique ( see * ? ? ? * ) as done in all the papers of the bocce project ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "homogeneous sets of three types of stellar evolution models .",
    "we keep using these relatively old models for sake of homogeneity within the bocce sample of clusters . ]",
    "are used to build a library of synthetic cmds .",
    "cluster parameters are determined by means of the comparison of the synthetic cmds with the observed ones .",
    "the best - fitting solution is chosen as the one that can best reproduce age - sensitive indicators : the mstp , the rc luminosity , the ms inclination and colour , and the rc colour . in order to make a meaningful comparison ,",
    "the synthetic cmds are made taking into account the photometric error , the completeness level of the photometry and the stellar density contrast of the oc population with respect to the population of an external field .",
    "the synthetic cmds are combined with stars picked from an equal area of the external field to take the contamination into account .",
    "multi - colour photometry has generally proven to be fundamental to obtain the best parameters estimation .",
    "hence , the best - fitting solutions are the ones that can reproduce at the same time all the observed cmds ( in our case , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) for appropriate distance modulus , reddening , metallicity , and age . for ngc  2355",
    "we fixed the metallicity of the models to the spectroscopic one ( i.e. we adopted the evolutionary tracks with solar value : @xmath16 ) , which helped us restricting the possible range of parameters . with this metallicity",
    "we obtained a good fit of both @xmath14 and @xmath15 observational cmds after adopting the standard extinction law ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , see @xcite ) , circumstance that further confirms the spectroscopic metallicity and indirectly supports the accuracy of our calibration .",
    "the best solution for each set of tracks is the one whose synthetic cmd fits most of the visible ms shape , the rc and mstp levels , the binary sequence , and , if present , the broadening of the ms due to differential reddening . in general",
    "we found rc colour sligthly redder in the synthetic cmds than in the observed one , especially in the @xmath14 case .",
    "however , this evolutionary stage strongly depends on fundamental parameters ( e.g. metallicity , age , helium content ) , and on physical inputs ( e.g. efficiency of core overshooting , mass loss ) to which colour is very sensitive .",
    "we also found an overall good agreement for the ms in the @xmath15 cmd and a worse fit in the case of the @xmath14 one , where the correct inclination of the sequence is not well reproduced .",
    "this is a rather common occurrence and probably the main driver of this mismatch is the uncertainty in the adopted temperature - colour transformations and in the model atmospheres ( as discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "however , we can not exclude a priori that systematic errors might be hidden in the calibration of the photometry because we could use only tertiary standards ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : calibration ] ) .",
    "concerning the fraction of binary systems and differential reddening we fine - tuned our synthetic cmds for different amount of these two quantities ( as done in other papers of this series , see for example @xcite ) .        for binaries , we build synthetic cmds where the desired percentage of objects is not a single star but objects that have the photometric properties of two randomly picked synthetic stars as they were photometrically unresolved . in the case of differential reddening",
    ", the adopted quantity is considered as an upper limit and added as a random positive constant to the mean galactic reddening .",
    "we found that the best estimation for the binary fraction is 35% and for the differential reddening is 0.08 mag , and kept them fixed them for all the following analysis .",
    "figure  [ figsynths ] shows the comparison between the observational cmd inside 5@xmath19 from the cluster centre ( a good compromise between having enough cluster stars in all evolutionary phases and low field stars contamination ) and the best fits obtained with the three sets of tracks .",
    "we recall that solar metallicity is assumed in all tests . to better compare data and models we draw the age sensitive indicators ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : cmd ] ) both in the observed and in the synthetic cmds .    with the padova models we found an age of 0.95 gyr , @xmath20 mag , and distance modulus @xmath21 mag .",
    "this model can adequately reproduce the luminosity levels of the mstp and rc .",
    "for the latter we obtained a good match of the colour on the @xmath15 plane while in @xmath14 the synthetic clump is too red ( about 0.1 mag redder ) . especially in the @xmath15 , the model",
    "well fit the observed ms down to magnitude @xmath22 20 mag .",
    "for the fst models we found the best fit for an age of 0.9 gyr , @xmath23 mag , and distance modulus @xmath24 mag .",
    "the colour and magnitude of the mstp are well reproduced and we found a very good fit to the ms especially in @xmath15 down to magnitude @xmath25 mag .",
    "the luminosity and colour of the rc are perfectly reproduced in the @xmath15 plane while the synthetic rc is slightly redder than observed in the @xmath14 plane .    in the case of the franec models we obtained the best fit for an age of 0.8 gyr , @xmath26 mag , and distance modulus @xmath27 mag . for this set of models we obtained the best fit of the ms down to magnitude @xmath28 mag , in particular in the @xmath15 plane , while the rc colour is too red in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 synthetic cmds . as expected , the ages derived from the franec models are lower than those from the other models .",
    "this is because the franec tracks do not include overshooting from convective cores , while the other two sets do .",
    "table  [ tab : summary ] shows the cluster parameters we derived , together with the implied galactocentric distance , height above the galactic plane , and mass at the msto .",
    "the typical errors on the cluster parameters are of the order of 0.05 gyr in age , 0.05 mag in reddening and 0.1 mag in distance modulus as found in other papers of this series . for comparison",
    ", literature values range between 0.7 and 1 gyr for the age , 0.1 and 0.3 mag for the reddening , 10.8 and 12 mag for the distance modulus ( see tab .",
    "[ t : lit ] ) .",
    "the age estimates are in good agreement with our analysis while the broad literature range of the other two parameters is likely due to the intrinsic difference of the analysis method and to the different metallicity estimates adopted ( usually lower than the solar value we used ) .",
    "in fact , metallicity has a larger impact on reddening and distance modulus than on age , which is less effected .",

    "with the analysis of ngc  2355 , both with photometry , to obtain age , distance , and reddening , and with spectroscopy for detailed chemistry , we add another cluster to the homogenous sample of bocce clusters .    to put ngc  2355 in the context of other ocs studied , we plot in figure  [ yong ] our results on a compilation of literature data .",
    "we took table  13 of @xcite as a starting point , but added other clusters analyzed in later papers .",
    "then , to have a more homogenous set , we selected only clusters in the bocce sample , either because we derived their distance and age ( and often , but not necessarily , the chemical abundances ) or their composition ( but not age and distance ) .",
    "we ended up with 30 selected clusters , for six of which we adopted literature distance and age while all the others have our bocce values ; 12 of the 30 clusters have only one spectroscopic analysis , 14 have two , and four have three or more .",
    "ngc  2355 falls within the distribution of the other clusters abundances .",
    "the information on this sample of ocs ( clusters , distance , age , metallicity , and selected elemental ratios , and references for these values ) is given in table 13 .",
    "no homogenisation has been done , we report results from the original papers .",
    "classically , ocs have been used to describe the disc metallicity distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* to cite only a few papers ) .",
    "the need of a homogeneous analysis for a large sample of clusters is one of the drivers of the bocce project ; however , we have not yet reached that goal .",
    "large surveys ( e.g. , gaia - eso , apogee , galah , see @xcite , respectively ) targeting also clusters will be fundamental in this respect , but they have not reached yet the  critical mass \" . in the meantime , fig .  [",
    "grad ] shows the possibilities and the limits of what can be done with the present samples ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) . in the upper panel",
    "we show the metallicity distribution , which displays a negative radial gradient in most of the disc , but a flatter slope in the outer part ( @xmath33 kpc ) values have been computed using uniformly @xmath34 kpc , also for the clusters for which we took distances from literature . ] .",
    "lines connect the different metallicities for the same cluster and we see that in some cases the differences exceed 0.1 dex , a reasonable average errorbar for the measures .",
    "the radial metallicity distribution of ocs can be interpreted in the light of chemical evolution models ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in which the rapid star formation rate in the inner disc together with the assumption of a different rate of infalling material from the intergalactic medium onto the the inner and outer disc , predict a negative metallicity gradient in the inner disc and a flattening in the outer one . however , the issue of the time evolution of the radial abundance gradients is far from being settled unequivocally both from the theoretical ( different model prescriptions lead to different scenarios : either a flattening or a steepening of the inner gradient with time ) and observational points of view ( some authors suggest that the radial metallicity distribution is not a negative gradient but rather a step distribution , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the interpretation becomes even more intriguing when dynamics is considered in galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "for example , flat abundance gradients could also be produced when radial mixing is taken into account ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , using n - body simulations , found a time - scale of 100myr for the radial migration of ocs .",
    "they demonstrated that in this time a cluster could move 1.5 kpc away from its birth location , a result stressing how important the dynamics can be in interpreting the chemical evolution history of the galactic disc .",
    "however , @xcite , by analyzing fgk stars near the sun , argue for the lack of a detectable influence of radial migration , at least in the solar neighborhood . determinations of abundance gradients in the disc at different ages are thus crucial to disentangle among different evolutive scenarios .",
    "the gaia - eso survey , with its large spectroscopic legacy ( high and intermediate resolution spectra of about @xmath35 stars in the mw and stars in about 70 ocs ) will have an important impact on this side .",
    "furthermore , within the survey there are ongoing projects focussed on the accurate analysis of clusters orbits ( e.g. jacobson et al . in prep . ) , following the same approach described in @xcite in the case of ngc  6791 , with the aim to build a comprehensive study of ocs which takes into account homogeneous chemical abundances and kinematics .",
    "gaia will further improve these studies with precise proper motions , helping in determining the impact of dynamics on the mw evolution .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ grad ] we show , for the same sample of ocs , the run of @xmath6-elements with @xmath36 .",
    "the distribution mirrors that of @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "21 ) , and seems to indicate that inner and outer disc ocs have a different level of @xmath6 enrichment , with a difference of 0.10 - 0.15 dex , again considering clusters within about 12 kpc from the galactic centre and farther than that .",
    "however , when discussing both the distributions shown in fig .  [ grad ]",
    ", we have to keep in mind that the abundance analysis is not fully homogenous . as an example of the importance of a homogenous analysis",
    ", we recall the recent study of @xcite where four inner disc ocs were studied , also in comparison with field stars analysed in the same way , using the same line lists , reference values , etc . in this way it was possible to highlight subtle differences in their chemical composition , being sure that they were not due to systematic errors , and question their origin within the galactic disc .",
    "similar , more complete studies will be performed on the complete ocs database of the gaia - eso survey and of other similar surveys    finally , figure  [ neutron ] shows the run of the abundance ratios [ ba / fe ] , [ y / fe ] , and [ la / fe ] with cluster age ; in the figure we use our values for ngc  2355 and three sets of data , taken from papers devoted to the study of neutron capture elements in large samples of clusters ; a ) @xcite ; b ) @xcite ; c ) @xcite .",
    "we took the original values from the papers , without any attempt at homogeneization ; we used the bocce value for age , if available ( but taking the original value would not change the picture ) .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : comparison ] , it is now well established that ocs do exhibit an anticorrelation between the [ ba / fe ] ratios and the clusters age . in order to provide a theoretical explanation to this abundance trend , @xcite ( and subsequently @xcite ) suggested that ba production in low - mass agb stars ( m @xmath37 1.5 m@xmath38 ) should be more efficient than that predicted by standard chemical evolution models , being the @xmath39c pocket , that is responsible for providing neutrons , larger than previously thought . if this were the case , then all the @xmath40-process elements , and in particular la and ce ( belonging to the same second s - process peak ) should follow the ba pattern , though at different extent .",
    "however , different studies have provided contradictory results : whereas @xcite concluded that all the other s - process elements reflect this increasing trend with decreasing age , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and very recently @xcite did not confirm such finding .",
    "this is also evident in figure  [ neutron ] , where y and la , at variance with ba , show a quite flat behaviour with the oc age . to draw final conclusions on this issue ,",
    "larger and very homogeneous samples are needed , especially for clusters younger than roughly 500 myr ; at the moment several possibilities remain open ( we refer the reader to @xcite for further discussion on this topic , including non - lte and activity effects impacting on ba abundances ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that , since s - process models can not account for ba production without bearing enhancements in the other s - process species , @xcite suggested a different synthesis channel to explain this peculiar trend , the so - called intermediate ( @xmath41 ) n - capture mechanism where neutron densities are intermediate between the low densities of the @xmath40-process and the very high values of the r - process ( see @xcite ) .",

    "2013 , 2015 : open blue squares ; in both cases only giants ) . for ngc  2355 the value by jacobson & friel is indicated by a red empty circles , our by a red star ( with errorbars indicating the rms of the measure , see table  [ mean ] ) . ]",
    "we were able to perform a complete analysis of the parameters of ngc  2355 , combining precise photometry from lbc@lbt and high - resolution spectroscopy with fies@not .",
    "we obtained observational cmds two magnitude deeper than literature ones and on a larger fov . by means of the well tested analysis of cluster parameters with the synthetic cmd technique , we derived age , distance , reddening , differential reddening , and binary fraction with three different set of tracks ( padova , fst , and franec ) .",
    "we found that ngc  2355 is located at about 1.6 kpc from the sun .",
    "its galactic position , towards the anti - centre , is at @xmath42 kpc and 300 pc above the plane ( assuming @xmath43 kpc ) .",
    "the age is between 0.8 and 0.95 gyr , depending on the adopted stellar model .",
    "the mean galactic reddening is @xmath44 mag , while the estimated differential reddening is about 0.08 mag and the estimated fraction of binaries is about 35% .",
    "the analysis of the high - resolution fies spectra of three giant stars ( belonging to the rc ) suggests an almost solar metallicity , with an average [ fe / h]@xmath45 dex .",
    "we derived abundances for o , the light elements na and al , the @xmath6-process elements mg , si , ca , ti ( from ti i and ii lines ) , the fe - group elements sc , cr ( from neutral and singly - ionised features ) , mn , ni , cu , zn , and for the neutron - capture elements y , zr , ba , la , ce , pr , nd , eu .",
    "when comparing with other ocs at the same metallicity and galactocentric distance , ngc  2355 falls within the distribution of the other cluster abundances . however , there are some exceptions , especially for neutron capture elements .",
    "we discussed possible explanations for these differences , in particular for ba , which resulted low for the cluster age , compared to expectations based on previous studies . in this case ,",
    "further investigations are needed to reach a firm conclusion which is , at the moment , constrained only by a limited number of stars .",
    "this analysis represents another step towards the homogeneous tracing of the chemical properties and evolution of the galactic disc set by the bocce project .",
    "we are aiming at a database of about 50 ocs to reach statistically significant and accurate results in order to shed a more robust light on the apparent uncertainties that still drive the interpretation of the galctic disc properties .",
