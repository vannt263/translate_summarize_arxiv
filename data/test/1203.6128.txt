    "compared to the dynamical - decoupling - based method @xcite in which a succession of short and strong pulses designed to suppress decoherence is applied to the system , qoct is a continuous dynamical modulation with many degrees of freedom for selecting arbitrary shapes , durations and strengths for time - dependent control , and thus allows significant reduction of the applied control energy and the corresponding quantum gate error .",

    "@xcite investigated the optimal control of a qubit coupled to a two - level system that is exposed to a markovian heat bath .",
    "although this may mimic the reduced non - markovian dynamics of the qubit , it is by no means a model of a qubit coupled directly to a non - markovian environment .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite investigated optimal quantum gate operations in the presence of non - markovian environments . however , to combine qoct with a non - markovian master equation involving time - ordered integration of the nonunitary ( dissipation ) terms for noncommuting system and control operators , and for a nonlocal - in - time memory kernel , the numerical treatment is rather mathematically involved and computationally demanding .",
    "all of the qoct approaches mentioned above @xcite for open quantum systems employed gradient - based @xcite algorithms for optimization .",
    "a somewhat different qoct approach from the standard gradient optimization methods is the krotov iterative method @xcite .",
    "the krotov method has several appealing advantages @xcite over the gradient methods : ( a ) monotonic increase of the objective with iteration number , ( b ) no requirement for a line search , and ( c ) macrosteps at each iteration .",
    "a version of the krotov optimization method has been used recently in ref .",
    "@xcite to deal with the non - markovian optimal control problem of a quantum brownian motion model with an exact stochastic equation of motion ( master equation ) .",
    "we note however that only a few non - markovian open quantum system models are exactly solvable @xcite ( the quantum brownian model is one of them ) , and the exact master equations of these exactly solvable models are known to be in a time - local ( time - convolutionless ) form with time - dependent decoherence or decay rates , without involving the time - ordering problem of non - commuting operators .",
    "@xcite . with time - local equations of motion ,",
    "the krotov method could be directly employed to deal with optimal - control problems .",
    "although it is commendable to derive an exact master equation , not too many problems can be exactly worked out in this way .",
    "for example , no exact master equation can be derived for the non - markovian qubit - environment ( spin - boson ) model studied as an illustration for quantum gate operations in this paper .",
    "it is thus important that an efficient qoct approach based on the krotov method for perturbative treatment of general ( not limited to just some certain classes of ) non - markovian open quantum systems should be developed .",
    "the perturbative non - markovian master equation under only the born approximation ( or the weak system - bath coupling approximation ) @xcite is in the form of a time - ordered non - commuting integro - differential equation [ e.g. , see eqs .",
    "( [ eom0 ] ) and ( [ k_diss ] ) ] , and at first sight it is not at all clear how to effectively combine this kind of master equation with the krotov optimization method . the study presented in this paper provides just such an efficient qoct approach based on the krotov method to deal with time - nonlocal non - markovian open quantum systems .",
    "our approach transforms the time - ordered non - commuting integro - differential master equation into a set of time - local coupled differential equations with the small price of introducing auxiliary density matrices in an extended auxiliary liouville space . as a result ,",
    "incorporation of the resultant time - local equations with the krotov optimization method becomes effective .",
    "we then apply the developed krotov method to the problem of finding the optimal quantum gate control sequence for a qubit in a non - markovian environment ( bath ) .",
    "our results illustrate that the control parameter can be engineered to efficiently counteract and suppress the environment effect for non - markovian open systems with long bath correlation times ( long memory effects ) .",
    "we also find that high - fidelity quantum gates with error smaller than @xmath1 can be achieved at long gate operation times for a wide range of bath decoherence parameters .",
    "this is in contrast to the cases in the literature @xcite , where the non - markovian systems were mainly studied in a parameter regime very close to markovian systems , and thus no significant reduction of the quantum gate errors was observed .",
    "in realistic experiments , one may have only limited control over the system hamiltonian , and the maximum control parameter strength that can be realized is also restricted .",
    "let us consider a total system with hamiltonian @xmath3 . here",

    "( [ k_diss ] ) contains the bath cf @xmath26 and the time - ordered system propagator superoperator @xmath27 which involves the control parameter @xmath5 through @xmath28 in @xmath16 .",
    "thus the control parameter and bath - induced nonunitary ( dissipation ) effect are correlated .",
    "this paves the way for manipulating the control sequence to counteract the effect of the bath on the system dynamics .",

    ", one would like to maximize the quality ( fidelity ) value of some target at time @xmath29 .",
    "suppose the desired state - independent unitary quantum gate operation is denoted as @xmath30 and the target is to perform a state - independent quantum gate operation as close as possible to @xmath30 .",
    "we choose the trace distance between the desired target superoperator @xmath30 and the actual nonunitary propagator superoperator @xmath31 at the final operation time @xmath29 to characterize the gate error , i.e. , @xmath32 ^ 2\\}/n$ ] , where @xmath33 is the dimension value of @xmath30 . as minimizing",

    ". then the task of quantum control is to maximize the objective ( [ costfx ] ) under the constraint of the equation of motion of @xmath38 obtained by replacing @xmath39 with @xmath38 in eqs .",

    "( [ eom0 ] ) is a nonlocal time - ordered integro - differential equation in which values of the control parameter at all earlier times come into play , and is difficult to incorporate within the framework of qoct .",
    "thus an approach that retains the merits of the krotov optimization method and removes the time - ordering and nonlocal problems in the equation of motion is very much desired .",

    "to find the optimal control sequence for a state - independent single - qubit gates in a non - markovian bath , one needs to know the bath spectral density to calculate the bath cf . we can deal with any form of the bath spectral density , but for simplicity , we take an ohmic spectral density in the form of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a dimensionless damping constant , and @xmath72 is the bath cutoff frequency .",

    "<S> an efficient optimal control theory based on the krotov method is introduced for a non - markovian open quantum system with a time - nonlocal master equation in which the control parameter and the bath correlation function are correlated . </S>",
    "<S> this optimal control method is developed via a quantum dissipation formulation that transforms the time - nonlocal master equation to a set of coupled linear time - local equations of motion in an extended auxiliary liouville space . as an illustration , </S>",
    "<S> the optimal control method is applied to find the control sequences for high - fidelity @xmath0-gates and identity - gates of a qubit embedded in a non - markovian bath . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-gates and identity - gates with errors less than @xmath1 for a wide range of bath decoherence parameters can be achieved for the non - markovian open qubit system with control over only the @xmath2 term . </S>",
    "<S> the control - dissipation correlation , and the memory effect of the bath are crucial in achieving the high - fidelity gates . </S>"
