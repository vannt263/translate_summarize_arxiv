    "quantum control over atom - light interaction is at the core of many recent developments that have greatly extended the horizon of cold - atom physics .",
    "a prominent example is the experimental realisation of synthetic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in ultracold atomic gases  @xcite . by coupling atomic states with raman lasers , the internal and the external degrees of freedom of the atoms",
    "are also coupled .",
    "this effective soc interaction modifies the single - particle dispersion spectra , and can lead to novel quantum states in both the few - body  @xcite and the many - body settings  @xcite . of particular interest is the possibility of preparing and probing topological states in cold atomic gases under synthetic soc .",
    "while solid - state materials with topologically non - trivial properties have been extensively studied in recent years  @xcite , ultracold atomic gases may serve as ideal platforms for the quantum simulation of exotic topological matter  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the highly tunable parameters of cold atoms should offer unprecedented control over interatomic interactions in a topological material , and thus would provide the intriguing opportunity of simulating topological states in a strongly interacting system .",
    "another exciting example in the quantum control over atom - light interaction is the combination of ultracold atoms and cavity quantum electrodynamics in the strong - coupling regime , where quantum effects of both the atoms and the cavity photons become dominant  @xcite . in these atom - cavity hybrid systems ,",
    "an outstanding feature is the interplay between the atoms and the cavity field : while the cavity field couples the internal states of atoms and affects the collective properties of the ensemble , the ensuing dynamics of the atomic gas feeds back on the cavity photons .",
    "hence , the cavity field not only serves as a dynamical variable for the many - body system , it also provides a means to detect , non - destructively , key properties of the hybrid system .",
    "a seminal experimental achievement in these systems is the recent observation of the dicke superradiance in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) coupled to cavity light fields  @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "as the system becomes superradiant , the back action of the cavity photons on the the atoms leads to a self organisation of the bec .",
    "furthermore , it has been demonstrated later that the dynamical structure factor of the bec can also be probed by monitoring photons leaking out of the cavity  @xcite .",
    "when the bec is replaced by a spinless degenerate fermi gas , it has been shown theoretically that the superradiant cavity field opens a bulk gap at the fermi surface , whereas the back action of the fermi gas gives rise to an enhancement of superradiance due to the nesting effect  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study a special atom - cavity hybrid system , where the cavity field participates in raman processes generating a synthetic soc .",
    "thus , this scenario combines the two interesting developments mentioned above .",
    "similar schemes have attracted much research interest recently  @xcite .",
    "for a two - component bec in a cavity , it has been shown that the cavity - assisted soc can lead to a rich phase diagram  @xcite ; whereas for a two - component degenerate fermi gas , an exotic topological superradiant ( tsr ) state can be stabilised  @xcite . in the tsr state ,",
    "the bulk gap opened by the superradiant cavity photons also protects topologically non - trivial properties of the fermi gas . as a result",
    ", local order parameters coexist with global topological invariants in the tsr state . here , we extend the studies in ref .",
    "@xcite , and characterise in detail various properties of the tsr state .    at the core of our discussion",
    "is the interplay of atoms and the cavity field .",
    "we first demonstrate that the cavity - induced inter - band couplings play a crucial role in inducing the topological phase transition between the conventional and the tsr state . for this purpose",
    ", we compare the phase diagrams of relevant tight - binding models involving different number of bands , and show explicitly that only by taking the lowest several bands into consideration would one recover , qualitatively , the phase diagram from a full - band calculation .",
    "this enables us to derive a minimum tight - binding hamiltonian for our system , which is helpful for generalising the steady - state phase diagram of the current system to other related systems .",
    "importantly , we notice that , in general , the multi - band effect is crucial in studying raman - induced synthetic soc in lattice systems .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with a recent study on laser - induced soc in lattice models  @xcite .",
    "we then investigate the back action of the topological phase transition of the fermi gas on the cavity photon . across the topological phase boundary between the trivial superradiant state and the tsr state , the bulk gap closes and opens again .",
    "we show that at this phase boundary , the fermi surface at half filling lies exactly at the gap closing point . as a result ,",
    "a spin - down state on the fermi surface would be scattered by a raman process to the spin - up state , which is also on the fermi surface .",
    "this is essentially the nesting effect discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , for a spinless fermi gas in a cavity .",
    "we show that the nesting effect here leads to a peak structure in the variation of the cavity photon occupation at the topological boundary . which can be used as a clear signature for the topological phase transition .    in the remainder of the work",
    ", we discuss the robustness of the tsr state by investigating the steady - state phase diagram under various circumstances .",
    "we find that the tsr state as well as the general outlook of the phase diagram are robust against finite - temperature effects , and that the tsr state should persist even in the absence of a background lattice potential .",
    "we also show that with a larger number of atoms in the cavity , which is most likely the case in experiments , the tsr state is actually more stable",
    ". hence , our study should be helpful for future experimental preparation and detection of the tsr state .",

    "we consider a quasi - one - dimensional , two - component fermi gas strongly coupled to an optical cavity .",
    "while the cavity is transversely pumped by a laser field , the pumping laser and the cavity field couple two hyperfine states in the ground - state manifold of each atom in two - photon raman processes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : config ] ) . while fermions in the cavity are non - interacting , they are subject to a background lattice potential , whose parameters can be controlled independently .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by using a two - mode cavity  @xcite . while the atoms are coupled to one of the modes ( pumped by a in fig .",

    "we also investigate the phase diagram under typical experimental conditions .     as the background .",
    "the parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag].,width=529 ]      for a one - dimensional fermi gas in a cavity , the fermi surface is just two points at zero temperature .",
    "the nesting condition is naturally satisfied when the fermions are at half filling in the lattice potential formed by the cavity field .",
    "it has been pointed out that , at zero temperature , the superradiance of a one - dimensional fermi gas can occur even with infinitesimally small pumping field  @xcite . as the temperature increases , the fermi surface becomes less well defined , which leads to a finite critical pumping field for the emergence of superradiance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab](a ) , we illustrate typical phase diagrams at zero temperature , both with ( blue ) and without ( red ) the background lattice potential @xmath125 . in either case , when the effective zeeman field @xmath63 is smaller than @xmath64 , the critical pumping strength @xmath36 for the onset of the tsr state is indeed zero .",
    "this is consistent with previous results .",
    "when the effective zeeman field becomes larger than @xmath64 , the possible phases and phase boundaries depend on the background lattice potential . in the absence of a background lattice potential",
    ", there is no band gap before the onset of superradiance .",
    "hence , there will be no trivial insulator state ( the i or the sr state ) , and the system directly enters the tsr state from either a fully polarised fermi gas ( fp ) ( @xmath65 ) or a partially polarised fermi gas ( pp ) ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "we note that , as the critical zeeman field @xmath64 is proportional to the band width , @xmath64 should increase with decreasing @xmath125 .",
    "similarly , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab](b ) typical phase diagrams at finite temperatures , both with ( black ) and without ( green ) the background lattice potential .",
    "the main difference with the zero - temperature case is that the onset of superradiance requires a finite pumping field .",
    "importantly , we see that the tsr state is robust against changes in temperature and the background lattice potential .",
    ", with @xmath126 ( blue ) and @xmath127 ( red ) ; ( b ) @xmath128 , with @xmath129 ( black ) and @xmath127 ( green).,width=604 ]      experimentally , quasi - one - dimensional atomic gases are typically prepared by applying a two - dimensional optical lattice potential  @xcite .",
    "this configuration should give rise to an array of quasi - one - dimensional atomic gases tightly confined in the transverse direction .",
    "as each quasi - one - dimensional tube in the array typically contains tens of atoms , it is worthwhile to explore the case where large number of atoms are present in the cavity . in this case",
    ", the effective hamiltonian should be modified as @xmath130\\hat{\\psi}_{\\nu,\\sigma}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\eta_{a}\\left(\\alpha+\\alpha^{\\ast}\\right)\\left[\\sum_{\\nu}\\int dx\\hat{\\psi}_{\\nu,\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\cos\\left(k_{0}x\\right)\\hat{\\psi}_{\\nu,\\downarrow}+\\rm{h.c.}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is the atomic annihilation operator in the @xmath132-th tube .",
    "the stationary condition then gives @xmath133}{\\delta_{a}+i\\kappa-\\xi_{a}\\sum_{\\nu,\\sigma}\\int dx\\langle\\hat{\\psi}_{\\nu,\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\\hat{\\psi}_{\\nu,\\sigma}\\rangle\\cos^{2}\\left(k_{0}x\\right)}.\\ ] ] it is then possible to follow the procedure outlined previously to self - consistently determine the steady - state of the system and map out the phase diagram .",
    "as an example , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : real ] a typical phase diagram with a total number of @xmath134 @xmath135li atoms loaded into a two dimensional optical lattice potential .",
    "we consider the lattice potential to have @xmath136 sites , which is also the number of quasi - one - dimensional tubes in the system .",
    "compared to the previous phase diagram ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediag ] ) , the tetracritical point as well as the phase boundaries are considerably lowered .",
    "more importantly , the requirements on the cavity parameters are also relaxed .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : real ] is calculated at a temperature of @xmath137 ( @xmath138nk for @xmath135li atoms ) , and with a weaker cavity - atom coupling @xmath139mhz , a larger single - photon detuning @xmath140ghz , and a larger cavity decay rate @xmath141mhz .",
    "hence , the tsr phase should persist under typical experimental conditions .",
    "we have discussed in detail various phases of a quasi - one - dimensional fermi gas under cavity assisted soc . as an outstanding feature of the cavity - atom hybrid system",
    ", we examine the feedback interactions between the fermi gas and the cavity field .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that the topological phase transition between the tsr state and the topologically trivial sr state is induced by cavity - assisted couplings to higher bands .",
    "by sequentially introducing high - lying bands into the tight - binding model , we show that to qualitatively reproduce the topological phase boundary , a tight - binding model should at least include the lowest three bands .",
    "we have also investigated how cavity - assisted inter - band coupling closes and reopens the bulk gap across the topological phase boundary . as lattice models with raman - assisted soc",
    "have attracted much attention recently , we expect that the effects of inter - band coupling on the topological phase transition are relevant to a wide class of systems . as the feedback action of the topological phase transition on the cavity field",
    ", we then show that a peak structure emerges along the topological phase boundary , in the rate of change of the cavity - field with respect to the pumping strength .",
    "we demonstrate the the formation of the peak structure can be understood from the perspective of either the satisfaction of the nesting condition or the band inversion at the bulk - gap closing point",
    ". apparently , the peak structure should be useful for non - demolition measurement of the topological phase transition .",
    "we have also studied the effects of temperature , background lattice potential , and atom number on the phase boundaries , and demonstrated that the tsr state is robust under typical experimental conditions . as an example",
    ", we have used the parameters of @xmath135li atoms , in which case the pseudo - spins can be chosen as @xmath142 states in the ground - state manifold . for @xmath143k atoms , due to the existence of more than two hyperfine states in the ground - state manifold",
    ", a large magnetic field is required to isolate the level structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] .",
    "the resulting large zeeman splitting between the pseudo - spin states would only allow the realisation of the large-@xmath63-side of the phase diagram .",
    "another possible choice of atom species is @xmath144yb , whose @xmath145 manifold has only two states with nuclear spins @xmath146 .",
