    "accreting low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) have been divided into two groups based on their broadband spectral and timing properties .",
    "the six currently - known @xmath0-sources , named for the three - branched shape they describe on a diagram of hard color versus soft color , are sco  x1 , gx  17@xmath12 , gx  349@xmath12 ( = sco  x2 ) , cyg  x2 , gx  340@xmath10 , and gx  5@xmath31 ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "from the top down , the three branches of the @xmath0 are known as the horizontal branch ( hb ) , normal branch ( nb ) , and flaring branch ( fb ) , and the power spectra of these sources generally show several types of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) and noise components ( e.g. van der klis 1995 ) based on the position of the source on the @xmath0 .",
    "when bright , cir  x1 also shows @xmath0-source characteristics ( shirey et al .  1998 ; shirey , bradt & levine 1999 ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate is generally thought to increase as the source passes from the hb , through the nb , to the fb .",
    "motion along the @xmath0 is continuous , with no jumps from branch to branch .    the remainder of the bright galactic lmxbs are known as atoll sources and describe a simpler curved shape on a color - color diagram , generally consisting of a band of points , plus one or more islands. atoll sources that display a range of intensities approaching two orders of magnitude may reveal a three - band shape ( muno , remillard & chakrabarty 2002 ) , but on much longer timescales ( @xmath2weeks  months ) than the @xmath0-source tracks ( @xmath2hours  days ) .",
    "the difference in their nature implies that @xmath0- and atoll - sources differ in their evolutionary history ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .    a previous _ rxte _ observation of lmc  x2 in 1997 december showed timing and spectral characteristics more typical of a @xmath0-source in its flaring branch than of an atoll source in any intensity state ( smale & kuulkers 2000 ) .",
    "based on these findings and the high intrinsic luminosity of lmc  x2 , which historically spans 0.42.0@xmath4 for reasonable estimates of the neutron star mass , we then provisionally reclassified lmc  x2 as a @xmath0-source , the seventh known and the first to be detected beyond our galaxy . here",
    "we present extensive additional _ rxte _ data from lmc  x2 in which the source convincingly traces out all three branches in its hardness - intensity and color - color diagrams , confirming its @xmath0-source identification .",
    "lmc  x2 was observed using the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _",
    "( bradt , rothschild , & swank 1993 ) on four occasions during 20012002 ( table  1 ) , for a total on - source good time of 600  ksec .",
    "the data presented here were collected by the proportional counter array ( pca ) instrument using the standard 2 and good xenon configurations , with time resolutions of 16  s and 0.95  @xmath5s respectively .",
    "the pca consists of five xe proportional counter units ( pcus ) numbered 04 , with a combined total effective area of about 6500  @xmath6 ( jahoda et al .",
    "pcus 0 and 2 were reliably on during all observations , and for consistency across the whole dataset we utilized data from just these pcus for the generation of light curves and color - color diagrams . to maximize the statistics , for our timing analysis we used data from all available pcus .",
    "cccc 1 & 50041 - 01 - 01- * & 2001 feb 10/17:35  feb 14/03:28 & 149 ksec + 2 & 60017 - 01 - 01- * & 2001 aug 30/12:12  sep 03/02:40 & 143 ksec + 3 & 60017 - 01 - 02- * & 2001 dec 13/22:22  dec 16/23:27 & 139 ksec + 4 & 60017 - 01 - 03- * & 2002 feb 01/02:56  feb 06/16:21 & 149 ksec +    the background - subtracted light curves for each observation presented in figure 1 include lmc  x2 data from the energy range 2.518.5  kev .",
    "to construct the hardness - intensity diagrams ( hid ) and color - color ( cd ) diagrams also shown , we followed conventional practice in the field and defined several `` colors '' , representing the ratios of count rates in two different energy bands .",
    "the `` overall '' color is the ratio of the 6.518.5  kev band to the 2.56.5  kev band , and the hid are plots of this overall color against the 2.518.5  kev source intensity .",
    "cd are plots of the `` hard '' color [ ( 9.818.5  kev)/(6.59.8  kev ] against the `` soft '' color [ ( 4.56.5  kev)/(2.54.5  kev ) ] .",
    "in figure  1a we show the background - subtracted light curve for the 2001 february observation .",
    "two episodes of major flaring are observed , during which the source intensity almost doubles .",
    "preceding this flaring behavior are two sections of low - level variability , and following the second series of flares the source settles into an interval of slightly higher , almost constant count rate .",
    "figure  1a also shows the hid and cd derived for these data using the colors defined in the previous section .",
    "these diagrams bear a remarkable resemblance to those seen in e.g. gx  17@xmath12 ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 , kuulkers et al .",
    "1997 , homan et al . 2002 ) and show very little similarity with those seen from atoll sources ( e.g.  hasinger & van der klis 1989 , prins & van der klis 1997 , wijnands et al .",
    "1998 ) . dividing the data into sections of a few hundred seconds each and examining the correlated variability in each section",
    "we can identify the three characteristic branches of the @xmath0 ; during the 83-hr span of the observation , lmc  x2 moves in turn through the nb , fb , nb , fb , nb , and hb .",
    "subsequent panels of figure  1 show the light curves , hids , and cds for the 2001 august , 2001 december , and 2002 february observations of lmc  x2 .",
    "the source spends almost all of the second observation on the fb , with some data defining the nb / fb vertex .",
    "the third observation contains data from the nb and part of the hb , while the fourth observation provides evidence for strong evolution along the hb , with a swift ( @xmath2few thousand second ) excursion through the nb and a brief flare lasting @xmath210,000s .",
    "examination of the hardness - intensity and color - color information for each observation on a point by point basis shows that the source moves along each branch in a continuous progression .",
    "no bursts were detected during any of the observations .    in figure  2",
    "we present the hid and cd for all four lmc  x2 observations combined . the combined cd ( fig .",
    "2b ) is a simple superposition of the data from all four of the individual cds in figure 1 .",
    "however , a small secular shift in the position of the hb / nb and nb / fb vertices is evident in the individual hids , and we thus subtracted constants of 0.045 and 0.01 from the colors given in fig .",
    "1b and fig .",
    "1d respectively , prior to the superposition .",
    "( failure to do this results in a combined hid with an unrealistically broad and skewed normal branch , and the appearance of two fbs . )    to assess whether these shifts were intrinsic to the source or to the _ rxte _ pca detectors , we analyzed data from the crab obtained close in time to our lmc  x2 observations .",
    "extraction of the crab cd and hid , using the same channels as those used for lmc  x2 , showed that the gradual gain change of the pca detectors over the span of our observations could account for a variation of less than 1% in the derived colors .",
    "the secular shifts in the hids of lmc  x2 amount to 10% and 2.5% changes , greatly in excess of this .",
    "we thus conclude that the source itself displayed intrinsic shifts , similar to the secular shifts seen in other @xmath0-sources ( see discussion ) .      for our power spectral analysis data",
    "were divided into three selections representing the hb , nb , and fb , based on their position along the z - track in the cd and hid .",
    "power spectra were created from the high - time - resolution good xenon mode data covering 221 kev , using standard fast fourier transform techniques over the frequency range 1/128512  hz .",
    "no narrow features were present in the power density spectra , and each could be well fit ( @xmath7=1.061.21 ) with a single power law with shape p @xmath8 @xmath9 , representing very low frequency noise ( vlfn ) . the low count rate of the source does not allow us to parameterize high - frequency noise ( hfn ) or perform a sensitive search for qpos .",
    "the horizontal branch spectrum ( figure  3a ) was constructed using 170  ksec of data , and the vlfn component has a power law index of @xmath10=0.60@xmath110.05 and an rms amplitude of 1.9@xmath110.1% ( 0.011  hz ) . for the normal branch spectrum ( fig .",
    "3b ) 229  ksec of data were used , and the power law component has @xmath10=0.90@xmath110.05 , rms=1.8@xmath110.1% .",
    "the flaring branch spectrum uses 161  ksec of data , and has @xmath10=1.33@xmath110.03 , rms=3.20@xmath110.05% .",
    "sections of data totaling 40  ksec were excluded from the analysis due to ambiguity about which branch they fell into ; datapoints obtained around the nb / fb vertex are particularly difficult to assign .    for the data obtained on the nb we detected no qpos , and and derive upper limits of 1% rms for oscillations with parameters typical of @xmath0-sources ( e.g.  centroid position of @xmath26  hz , fwhm 2  hz ) . for the fb data we detected a peak at 13.2@xmath110.2",
    "hz with width 4.9@xmath110.3  hz and rms 1.9@xmath110.5% , but its low ( 2@xmath12 ) significance was not compelling .",
    "using 600  ksec of new data from the bright lmc binary lmc  x2 , we have shown that the source traces out @xmath0-like tracks in the hid and cd , moving continuously along three branches and not jumping instantaneously from one to the next .",
    "the pattern , width , and extent of the tracks show particular similarity with those observed from gx  17@xmath12 ( e.g.  homan et al .",
    "2002 ) , sco  x1 ( e.g.  dieters & van der klis 2000 ) , and gx  349@xmath12 ( e.g.  oneill et al .",
    "2002 ) , and have little in common with the simpler atoll source tracks .    by convention ,",
    "position on the @xmath0 is parameterized using the @xmath13 rank number , in which the hb / nb and nb / fb vertices are defined as @xmath13=1 and @xmath13=2 respectively , and the rest of the track is scaled according to the length of the nb ( e.g.  hasinger et al .",
    "1990 ; hertz et al .  1992 ; dieters & van der klis 2000 ) . adopting this parameterization ,",
    "we have obtained data from lmc  x2 covering the range @xmath141.04.6 , a full span equivalent to that seen in the other @xmath0-sources .",
    "our observations show good coverage of all three branches ; lmc  x2 spent roughly 30% , 40% , and 30% of the total observing time in the hb ( @xmath15 ) , nb ( @xmath16 ) , and fb ( @xmath17 ) respectively .",
    "the power density spectra derived from the three branches of lmc  x2 appear rather featureless when compared to those of the @xmath0 sources , or indeed to those of the atoll sources .",
    "the spectra are dominated by vlfn , with little significant evidence for either peaked low frequency noise ( lfn ) at 10100  hz , or nbo / fbo .",
    "the power law indices and rms amplitudes measured for the vlfn in lmc  x2 , and the overall steepening trend of the vlfn when moving from the hb to the fb , are similar to those observed in the @xmath0 sources gx  349@xmath12 , sco  x1 , and gx  17@xmath12 , with a particularly close match to the relatively flat vlfn indices of @xmath10=0.62.0 measured in gx  17@xmath12 data ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1997 ; dieters & van der klis 2000 ; oneill et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ; homan et al .",
    "of course , the power law indices we measure may be artificially low , due to the possibility of contamination by unresolved lfn and hfn components .    on the basis of their timing and spectral behavior ,",
    "the galactic @xmath0-sources have been divided into two categories ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; penninx et al .  1991 ; kuulkers et al .",
    "it has been proposed that the cyg - like sources , cyg  x2 , gx  51 , and gx  340@xmath10 , have either a higher inclination ( kuulkers , van der klis & vaughan 1996 ) or a higher magnetic field strength ( psaltis , lamb & miller 1995 ) than the sco - like sources , sco  x1 , gx  17@xmath12 , and gx  349@xmath12 . based on the shapes of its hid and cd , and the observation of intensity flares rather than dips in its fb , lmc  x2 falls squarely into the sco - like category .",
    "however , the cyg - like sources typically show secular variations in the position of the @xmath0 of @xmath2510% ( gx  51  kuulkers et al .",
    "1994 ; cyg x2  kuulkers et al .  1996 , wijnands et al .  1997b",
    "; gx340@xmath10  kuulkers & van der klis 1996 ) , while in the sco - like sources secular changes in the @xmath0 are rare , seen only occasionally in one source , gx  17@xmath12 ( wijnands et al 1997a ; homan et al 2002 ) . in this context ,",
    "the secular shifts of 2.510% we observe from lmc  x2 over the course of a year become intriguing .",
    "a series of _ rxte _ observations is currently under way to provide medium - term monitoring of lmc  x2 to further study the degree and timescale of these secular variations , and perform additional sensitive searches for qpos .",
