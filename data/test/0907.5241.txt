    "the study of networks has experienced enormous growth in recent years , providing foundational insights into numerous complex systems ranging from protein interaction networks in biology to online friendship networks in the social sciences @xcite .",
    "research on ecological and organizational networks has provided a general framework to study the mechanisms that mediate the cooperation and competition dynamics between individuals @xcite . in these networks ,",
    "competitive interactions result from the indirect competition between members of different populations , who either compete for the same resources or are linked through consumer - resource relationships .",
    "however , data on mutually - antagonistic interactions  i.e .",
    ", individuals who directly fight or compete against each other  have been more difficult to collect @xcite .",
    "mutually - antagonistic interactions also occur frequently in different social contexts such as sports . in the present paper , we consider head - to - head matchups between major league baseball ( mlb ) pitchers and batters : pitchers benefit by  defeating \" batters , and vice versa",
    ". using data from retrosheet.org , we characterize the more than eight million mlb plate appearances from 1954 to 2008 , considering full careers by examining head - to - head matchups over a multi - season (  career \" ) network and single - season performances by constructing networks for individual seasons .",
    "to compare the performance of players , mlb uses votes by professional journalists to recognize career achievement of players through induction into a hall of fame ( hof ) and single - season performance through awards such as most valuable player ( mvp ) and cy young ( for pitching performance ) @xcite .",
    "although the hof purports to recognize the best players of all time , the selection of players to it is widely criticized by fans and pundits each year because of the lack of consistency when , e.g. , comparing players from different eras , who play under fundamentally different conditions  in different ballparks , facing different players , etc .",
    "such arguments come to the fore when attempting to draw comparisons between players elected to the hof and others who did not make it .",
    "for instance , how can one tell whether jim rice ( elected to the hof in 2009 ) had a better career than albert belle ( who dropped off the ballot because of low vote totals after only two years ?",
    "does bert blyleven , who appeared on 62.7% of the hof ballots in 2009short of the 75% required for election  belong in the hof ?",
    "is sandy koufax , who played from 1955 - 1966 and is in the hof , better than pedro martinez , who was still active during the 2008 season and who will presumably eventually be elected to the hof ? to address such questions , it is insufficient to rely purely on raw statistics ; one must also consider quantitative mechanisms for comparison between athletes who played under different conditions .",
    "we take a first , simple step in this direction through the study of biased random walkers on these graphs @xcite , allowing us to not only construct a quantitative , systematic , and transparent ranking methodology across different eras , but also to investigate the interplay between these dynamics and the underlying graph structure and to reveal key properties of mutually - antagonistic interactions that can potentially also be applied in other settings .    while  water - cooler \" discussions about the hof can often be fascinating , as indicated by the above paragraph",
    ", we stress that the primary goal of our paper is to investigate interesting features of the baseball _ networks _ and the impact that network structure can have on rankings rather than on the rankings themselves . while it is necessary to include some example rank orderings for the purpose of such a discussion , it is important to note that the rankings we show in the present paper must be taken with several grains of salt because our efforts at simplicity , which are crucial to highlighting the interplay between network structure and player rankings , require us to ignore essential contributing factors ( some of which we will briefly discuss ) that are necessary for any serious ranking of baseball players .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we define and characterize the mutually - antagonstic baseball networks and study the time evolution of various graph properties . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we provide a description of the biased random walker dynamics that we employ as a ranking methodology across eras and for single - season networks . in section [ sec4 ]",
    ", we study the interplay between the random walker dynamics and graph structure , paying special attention to the sensitivity of the player rankings . in section [ sec5 ] ,",
    "we conclude the paper and discuss a number of potential applications of our work .",
    "we explain additional technical details in two appendices .",
    "we analyze baseball s mutually - antagonistic ecology by considering bipartite ( two - mode ) networks of head - to - head matchups between pitchers and batters . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , bipartite networks are formed using two disjoint sets of vertices , @xmath0 ( pitchers ) and @xmath1 ( batters ) , and the requirement that every edge connect a vertex in @xmath0 to one in @xmath1 @xcite ( keeping the pitching and batting performances of pitchers as two separate nodes ) .",
    "we consider such interactions in terms of three different bipartite representations ( with corresponding matrices ) : ( 1 ) the binary matchups @xmath2 in which the element @xmath3 equals @xmath4 if pitcher @xmath5 faced batter @xmath6 at any point and @xmath7 otherwise ; ( 2 ) the weighted matchups @xmath8 in which the element @xmath9 equals the number of times that @xmath5 faced @xmath6 ; and ( 3 ) the weighted outcomes @xmath10 in which the element @xmath11 equals a `` score '' or performance index , which in the case of picther - batter matchups is determined using what are known in baseball as  sabermetric \" statistics ( see the discussion below ) @xcite , characterizing the results of all matchups between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "for each of these bipartite pitcher ",
    "batter networks , we also utilize corresponding square adjacency matrices : @xmath12 so that they are appropriately symmetric ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and anti - symmetric ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we construct and analyze each of these representations for the single - season networks and the aggregate ( career ) network that contains all pitcher  batter interactions between 1954 and 2008 .    to identify the changes in the organization of baseball networks , we examine the graph properties of single - season networks",
    "the number of distinct opponents per player , given by the distribution of player degree @xmath16 , follows an exponential distribution for a large range and then has an even faster decay in the tail ( see fig .",
    "[ figs1 ] ) .",
    "the mean values of the geodesic path length between nodes and of the bipartite clustering coefficient are only somewhat larger than what would be generated by random assemblages ( see appendix [ app1 ] ) . however , as with mutually - beneficial interactions in ecological networks @xcite , the mutually - antagonistic baseball matchup networks exhibit non - trivial relationships between player degree and player strength @xmath17 , which represents the total number of opponents of a player ( counting multiplicity ) @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , the relation between strength and degree is closely approximated by a power law @xmath18 that starts in 1954 at @xmath19 for pitchers and @xmath20 for batters but approaches @xmath21 for each by 2008 .",
    "the six - decade trend of a decreasing power - law exponent indicates how real - life events such as the increase in the number of baseball teams through league expansion ( e.g. , in the 1960s , 1977 , 1993 , and 1998 ) , reorganization ( e.g. , in 1994 , to three divisions in each league instead of two ) , interleague play ( in 1997 ) , and unbalanced schedules ( in 2001 ) have modified the organization of the networks .",
    "an important property mediating the competition dynamics of mutualistic networks in ecology is _ nestedness _ @xcite .",
    "although the definition of nestedness may vary , a network is said to be nested when low - degree nodes interact with proper subsets of the interactions of high - degree nodes @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . to calculate the aggregate nestedness in the binary matchup network @xmath2",
    ", we employed the nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing fill ( nodf ) @xcite , which takes values between @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath4 designates a perfectly - nested network ( see appendix [ app1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2]b ( black circles ) shows that single - season baseball networks consistently have nestedness values of approximately @xmath23 .",
    "this value is slightly but consistently higher than those in randomized versions of the networks with similar distribution of interactions ( red squares ) @xcite , which we also observe to decrease slightly in time . in common with bipartite cooperative networks",
    ", this confirms that nestedness is a significant feature of these mutually - antagonistic networks .",
    "although nestedness is defined as a global characteristic of the network , we can also calculate the individual contribution of each node to the overall nestedness @xcite .",
    "comparing node degrees and individual nestedness ( see appendix [ app1 ] ) before 1973 , batters and pitchers collapse well onto separate curves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) . starting in 1973 , however ,",
    "each of these split into two curves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) , corresponding to players in the two different leagues : the american league ( al ) and the national league ( nl ) .",
    "this structural change presumably resulted from the al s 1973 introduction of the designated hitter ( dh ) , a batter who never fields but bats in place of the team s pitchers ( see fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] ) , apparently causing the al to become less nested due to the replacement of low - degree batting pitchers with higher - degree dhs .",
    "this suggests , as we discuss below , that the network position of a player might affect his own ranking ( while , of course , network position is strongly influenced by a player s longevity and , thus , by his performance ) .",
    "to compare the performance of players , we rank players by analyzing biased random walkers on the bipartite network @xmath10 encoding the outcomes of all mutually - antagonistic interactions between each player pair .",
    "our method generalizes the technique we previously used for ncaa football teams @xcite , allowing us to rank players in individual seasons and in the 19542008 career network , yielding a quantitative , conceptually - clear method for ranking baseball players that takes a rather different approach from other sabermetric methods used to project player performance such as diamondmind ( which uses monte carlo simulations ) , pecota ( which uses historical players as a benchmark ) , and chone ( which uses regression models ) @xcite .",
    "to describe the aggregate interaction @xmath11 between pitcher @xmath5 and batter @xmath6 , we need to quantify each possible individual pitcher  batter outcome . for simplicity , we focus on the quantity _ runs to end of inning _",
    "( rue ) @xcite , which assigns a value to each possible plate appearance outcome ( single , home run , strikeout , etc . ) based on the expected number of runs that a team would obtain before the end of that inning , independent of the situational context ( see appendix [ app2 ] for specific values ) .",
    "higher numbers indicate larger degrees of success for the batting team . for each season",
    ", we add the rue from each plate appearance of pitcher @xmath5 versus batter @xmath6 to obtain a cumulative rue for the pair . note that any performance index that assigns a value to a specific mutually - antagonistic interaction can be used in place of rue without changing the rest of our ranking algorithm .",
    "we then define the single - season outcome element @xmath11 by the cumulative extent to which the batter s outcome is better ( @xmath24 ) or worse ( @xmath25 ) than the mean outcome over all pitcher ",
    "batter matchups that season .",
    "when defining the career outcome element @xmath11 for 19542008 , we account for baseball s modern era offensive inflation @xcite by summing over individual seasons ( i.e. , relative to mean outcomes on a per season basis ) .",
    "we initiate our ranking methodology by considering independent random walkers who each cast a single vote for the player that they believe is the best .",
    "each walker occasionally changes its vote with a probability determined by considering the aggregate outcome of a single pitcher ",
    "batter pairing , selected randomly from those involving their favorite player , and by a parameter quantifying the bias of the walker to move towards the winner of the accumulated outcome .",
    "a random walker that is considering the outcome described by this matchup is biased towards but not required to choose the pitcher ( batter ) as the better player if @xmath25 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the expected rate of change of the number of votes cast for each player in the random walk is quantified by a homogeneous system of linear differential equations @xmath26 , where @xmath27 the long - time average fraction of walkers @xmath28 residing at ( i.e. , voting for ) player @xmath6 is then found by solving the linear algebraic system @xmath29 , subject to an additional constraint that @xmath30 .",
    "if the bias parameter @xmath31 , successful players will on average be ranked more highly . for @xmath32 , the random walker votes will instead tend toward the `` loser '' of individual matchups .",
    "equation ( [ system ] ) gives a general one - parameter system for a biased walker with probabilities that are linear in rue , but the approach is easily generalized by using other functional forms to map observed plate appearance outcomes ( in @xmath10 ) into selection probabilities . by restricting our attention to a form that is linear in rue",
    ", the interpretation that the off - diagonal components of @xmath33 correspond to random walker rate coefficients requires that these components remain non - negative , a preferable state that leads to a number of beneficial properties in the resulting matrix .",
    "for example , this allows us to apply the perron - frobenius theorem , which guarantees the existence of an equilibrium @xmath34 with strictly positive entries ( and similarly guarantees the existence of positive solutions in algorithms such as pagerank ) @xcite . in practice , this requirement is equivalent in the baseball networks to @xmath35 , so that the result of a home run in a single plate - appearance matchup ( i.e. , the case in which a batter faces a pitcher exactly once and hits a home run in that appearance ) maintains a small but non - negative chance that a corresponding random walker will still select the pitcher .",
    "however , because the aggregate outcome of most pairings remains close to the mean , the bias in the random walk is small , and the rankings become essentially independent of the bias parameter .",
    "the linear expansion in bias @xmath36 thereby yields a ranking with no remaining parameters beyond the statistically - selected rue values , given by @xmath37 . generalizing the similar expansion described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the zeroth - order term results in a constant number of votes per player , and the additional contribution at first order is given by the solution of a discrete poisson equation on the graph : @xmath38 subject to the neutral charge constraint @xmath39 .",
    "( by analogy with electrostatics , we refer to @xmath40 as the rue ` charge ' of node @xmath6 . ) in equation ( [ firstorder ] ) , @xmath41 is the total number of players , @xmath42 is the graph laplacian , @xmath43 is the diagonal matrix with elements @xmath44 ( and @xmath45 for @xmath46 ) .",
    "accordingly , we restrict our attention to the first - order ranking specified by @xmath47 and obtained using the solution of equation .",
    "we tabulate this rank ordering separately for pitchers and batters , for individual seasons and the full career network .",
    "we compare the results of the random walker ranking to major baseball awards in table [ tables1 ] .",
    "we note that the rankings are highly correlated with the underlying rue per plate appearance of each player ( @xmath48 for 2008 and similar for other seasons ) , so that the top players in the rankings produced by our method have a strong but imperfect correlation with the lists produced by ranking players according to raw rue values .",
    "( this similarly holds for any other sabermetric quantity that one might use in place of rue . )",
    "that is , it matters which players one has faced , and that is codified by the network .",
    "we note , for example , that the differences between random walker rankings and raw rue rankings appear to appropriately capture the caliber of opponents ( for example , pitchers from teams with relatively anemic offenses  such as the 2008 nationals , astros , and reds  have a higher ranking in the random walker ranking , reflecting that they never had the good fortune of going up against their own teams batters ) .",
    "we also compared the rankings with a leading metric in baseball analysis , espn s mlb player ratings , which combines ratings from espn , elias , inside edge , and _ the baseball encyclopedia _ @xcite .",
    "of the top 99 players for 2008 who are listed in the player ratings , 12 did not meet our threshold for plate appearances . comparing the random walker results for the remaining 87 players with the player ratings yields a @xmath49 correlation .",
    "we thus proceed to study the random walker results for the full career ranking both with confidence that it correlates with methods currently used for single - season analysis and caution that the ranking details do not capture all effects according to current best practices in quantitative baseball analysis @xcite .",
    "the full career ranking allows credible comparisons between players from different eras .",
    "interestingly , considering the rankings restricted to individuals who played in at least 10 seasons during this time ( hof - eligible players ) , we find that barry bonds ( batter ) , pedro martinez ( pitcher ) , and mariano rivera ( relief pitcher ) are the best players ( in these categories ) from 1954 to 2008 . we show additional rankings in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we especially note that albert belle ( 29th among batters ) is ranked much higher than jim rice ( 115th ) , suggesting that belle s hitting performance perhaps merits hof membership more than that of rice .",
    "similarly , bert blyleven ranks higher not only than current hof competitors such as jack morris and tommy john but also higher than three hof pitchers with over 300 wins ( steve carlton , phil niekro , and don sutton ) , which is one traditional benchmark for selecting elite pitchers .",
    "direct comparison with other rank orderings of players across different eras would necessitate restriction to sufficiently similar time periods and is thus beyond the network - science focus of the present study .",
    "as previously suggested , the network architecture should have important effects on the performance of players .",
    "in particular , central players in the network might have a systematic advantage in the rankings relative to those who are not as well connected .",
    "such structurally - important players ( see table [ table1 ] for examples ) , who have high values for both betweenness centrality and nestedness , have had long  and usually extremely successful ",
    "careers , so it is of significant interest , yet difficult , to gauge the coupled effects on their rank ordering from statistical success versus structural role in the network .",
    "in fact , we found no correlation ( @xmath50 ) between a player s position  i.e .",
    ", individual nestedness and betweenness  and his success measured by the fraction of votes received .",
    "hence , we investigate this connection further via the correlation between the sensitivity of rankings to changes in outcomes in individual pitcher  batter pairs , which is formulated using the moore - penrose pseudo - inverse of the graph laplacian .",
    "consider changing the outcome of the single edge that corresponds to the aggregate matchup between players @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "if we increase the former s aggregate rue by a unit amount at the expense of the latter , then the total rms change in votes @xmath47 is proportional to the difference between the @xmath5th and @xmath6th columns of @xmath51 .",
    "this difference yields a node - centric measure of the sensitivities of rankings to individual performances : the constraint @xmath52 yields that @xmath53 ( the diagonal element of the graph laplacian pseudo - inverse ) , the direct control that player @xmath5 has over his own ranking , is equal and opposite to the total change his performance directly imposes on the rest of the network . additionally , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , the quantity @xmath53 is closely related to the rms changes in votes across the network due to the performance of player @xmath5 .",
    "noting that the element @xmath53 is related to the mean of the commute times between nodes @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( averaging over all @xmath6 ) @xcite , specifically under our constraints , the sum of the commute times @xmath54 over @xmath6 yields a linear function of @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , @xmath53 provides a node - based measure of the average distance from node @xmath5 to the rest of the network .",
    "this definition of average commute time has similarities with the measures known as information centrality @xcite and random walk centrality @xcite ( though the results of applying the different measures can still be quite different ) . the negative relationship between @xmath53 and both betweenness centrality and nestedness , which we show in fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] , thus yields a corresponding negative relationship between the mean commute distance and the betweenness and nestedness of a player .",
    "a player who is highly embedded in the network ( i.e. , one with high individual nestedness ) has a small mean commute distance to the rest of the network , and the ranking of that player is not very sensitive to the outcome of a single matchup .",
    "in contrast , a player who is in the periphery of the network ( i.e. , one with low individual nestedness ) typically has a very large mean commute distance to other portions of the graph , and his place in the ranking - ordering is consequently much more sensitive to the results of his individual matchups .",
    "this would suggest that players in the al tend on average to be more prone to changes in their own rankings than players in the nl ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) .",
    "remarkably , we can make these general notions much more precise , as @xmath55 , where we recall that @xmath56 is the strength of node @xmath5 ( see fig .  [ fig3]b ) .",
    "some similarities between these quantities is reasonably expected ( cf .",
    "the role of relaxation times in a similar relationship with random walk centrality in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can be quantified by an eigenvalue analysis ) .",
    "this simple relationship belies a stunning organizational principle of this network : the global quantity of average commute time of a node is well - approximated by its strength , a simple local quantity .",
    "that is , in the appropriate perturbation analysis to approximate the laplacian pseudo - inverse , the higher order terms essentially cancel out , contributing little beyond the ( zeroth - order ) local contribution .",
    "we also found a rougher relationship for nestedness and betweenness ( see fig .",
    "[ figs3 ] ) .",
    "these results have two interesting implications .",
    "first , they reveal that the success of well - connected players depends fundamentally on a strong aggregate performance rather than just on their position in the network .",
    "second , they imply that neophyte players would need to face well - connected players if they want to establish a stronger connection to the network and a ranking that is less vulnerable to single matchups .",
    "similarly , recent research on mutualistic networks in ecology has found that neophyte species experience lower competition pressures by linking to well - connected species @xcite .",
    "our findings on baseball - player rankings suggest the possibility of finding similar competition patterns in mutually - antagonistic interactions in ecological and social networks .",
    "drawing on ideas from network science and ecology , we have analyzed the structure and time - evolution of mutually - antagonistic interaction networks in baseball .",
    "we considered a simple ranking system based on biased random walks on the graphs and used it to compare player performance in individual seasons and across entire careers .",
    "we emphasize that our ranking methodology is overly simplistic , having noted several considerations that one might use to improve it ( see , e.g. , appendix b ) while maintaining a network framework that accounts for which players each player has faced .",
    "we also examined how the player rankings and their sensitivities depend on node - centric network characteristics .",
    "we expect that similar considerations might be useful for developing a better understanding of the interplay between structure and function in a broad class of competitive networks , such as those formed by antigen - antibody interactions , species competition for resources , and company competition for consumers .",
    "given the motivation from ecology , we are optimistic that this might lead to interesting ecological insights , compensating for the difficulty in collecting data on the regulatory dynamics of mutually - antagonistic networks in ecology  such as the ones formed by parasites and free - living species @xcite  or assessing the potential performance of invasive species from different environments @xcite",

    "one can also incorporate ideas like ballpark effects into the metric employed at this stage of the algorithm without changing any other part of the method . although it would make the methodology more complicated ( in contrast to our goals )",
    ", it is also possible to generalize the algorithm to include more subtle effects such as estimates for when player performance peaks and how it declines over a long career .",
    "some of the active players in the data set have not yet entered a declining phase in their careers and might have higher rankings now than they will when their careers are over .",
    "we expect that the relatively high rankings of modern players versus ones who retired long ago might also result in part from the increased performance discrepancy between the top players and average players in the present era versus what used to be the case and in part from performing well against the larger number of relatively poor players occupying rosters because of expansion @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that batter  pitcher matchups are not fully random but contain significant correlations ( e.g. , in a given baseball game , the entire lineup of one team has plate appearances against the other team s starting pitcher ) that can be incorporated to generalize the random walker process itself @xcite .    to include the outcome of players who did not have many plate appearances without skewing their rankings via small samples",
    ", we separately accumulate the results for all pitchers and batters with fewer than some threshold number of plate appearances @xmath92 into a single `` replacement pitcher '' and `` replacement batter '' to represent these less prominent players . in the results presented in this paper",
    ", we used the threshold @xmath93 both for single seasons and for the collective outcome matrix . note that similar thresholds exist when determining single - season leadership in quantities such as batting average ( which requires 3.1 plate appearances per team game , yielding 502 in a 162-game season ) and earned run average ( 1 inning per team game ) ."

    "<S> we formulate the head - to - head matchups between major league baseball pitchers and batters from 1954 to 2008 as a bipartite network of mutually - antagonistic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both the full network and single - season networks , which exhibit interesting structural changes over time . </S>",
    "<S> we find interesting structure in the network and examine their sensitivity to baseball s rule changes . </S>",
    "<S> we then study a biased random walk on the matchup networks as a simple and transparent way to compare the performance of players who competed under different conditions and to include information about which particular players a given player has faced . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a player s position in the network does not correlate with his success in the random walker ranking but instead has a substantial effect on its sensitivity to changes in his own aggregate performance . </S>"
