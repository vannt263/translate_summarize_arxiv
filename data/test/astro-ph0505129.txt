    "since the discovery of the first known pulsating x - ray sources her x-1 and cen x-3 more than three decades ago ( giacconi et al . 1971 ; tananbaum et al . 1972 ) ,",
    "over 50 new sources have been detected in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds , with luminosities in the range @xmath0 and pulsation periods @xmath1 .",
    "x - ray pulsars include a variety of objects powered by rotation or accretion , as well as several anomalous x - ray pulsars whose energy source is currently unclear .",
    "the emission from x - ray pulsars in binary systems is fueled by the accretion of material from the `` normal '' companion onto the neutron star , with the flow channeled onto one or both of the magnetic poles by the strong field . during the accretion process",
    ", gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy , which escapes from the column in the form of x - rays as the gas decelerates through a radiative shock before settling onto the stellar surface . in the accretion - powered sources , which are the focus of this paper , the x - ray spectra",
    "are often well fitted using a combination of a power - law spectrum plus a blackbody component with a temperature in the range @xmath2k ( e.g. , coburn et al .",
    "2002 ; di salvo et al .",
    "1998 ; white et al . 1983 ) .",
    "most spectra also display quasi - exponential cutoffs at @xmath3kev , and there are indications of cyclotron features and iron emission lines in a number of sources .",
    "the observations suggest typical magnetic field strengths of @xmath4 g .",
    "although accretion - powered x - ray pulsars are among the most luminous sources in the galaxy , previous attempts to calculate their spectra based on static or dynamic theoretical models have generally yielded results that do not agree very well with the observed profiles ( e.g. , mszros & nagel 1985a , b ; nagel 1981 ; yahel 1980 ; klein et al .",
    "hence there is still no clear understanding of the basic spectral formation mechanism in x - ray pulsars ( see the discussion in coburn et al .",
    "2002 ) . given the lack of a viable theoretical model , x - ray pulsar spectral data have traditionally been fit using multicomponent forms that include absorbed power - laws , cyclotron features , iron emission lines , blackbody components , and high - energy exponential cutoffs .",
    "the resulting parameters are sometimes difficult to relate to the physical properties of the source . motivated by the lack of a comprehensive theoretical model for x - ray pulsar spectral formation , we reconsider here the physical picture originally proposed by davidson ( 1973 ) , in which the accreting gas passes through a radiative , radiation - dominated shock before settling onto the surface of the star .",
    "we illustrate the accretion / emission geometry schematically in figure  1 .",
    "most of the photons emitted from the accretion column are produced in the dense `` thermal mound '' located inside the column , just above the stellar surface .",
    "the blackbody photons created in the mound are upscattered in the shock , and eventually diffuse through the walls of the column .",
    "the escaping photons carry away the kinetic energy of the gas , thereby allowing the plasma to settle onto the surface of the star .",
    "the strong compression that occurs as the plasma crosses the radiative shock renders it an ideal site for first - order fermi energization ( i.e. , `` bulk '' or `` dynamical '' comptonization ) of the photons produced by the thermal mound . in the bulk comptonization process , particles experience a mean energy gain if the scattering centers they collide with are involved in a converging flow ( e.g. , laurent & titarchuk 1999 ; turolla , zane , & titarchuk 2002 ) . by contrast , in the thermal comptonizaton process , particles gain energy due to the _ stochastic _ motions of the scattering centers via the second - order fermi mechanism ( e.g. , sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ; becker 2003 ) . in the x - ray pulsar application ,",
    "the scattering centers are infalling electrons , and the energized `` particles '' are photons . since the inflow speed of the electrons in an x - ray pulsar accretion column is much larger than their thermal velocity , bulk comptonization dominates over the stochastic process except at the highest photon energies ( titarchuk , mastichiadis , & kylafis 1996 ) , as discussed in   7 .",
    "the failure of the current models to generate the power - law spectral shape characteristic of x - ray pulsars probably stems from the neglect of the critical contribution of the shock in upscattering the soft radiation produced in the thermal mound ( e.g. , burnard , arons , & klein 1991 ) .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that bulk comptonization of the radiation in the accretion shock can produce spectra very similar to the power - law continuum seen in many x - ray pulsars .",
    "the main results presented here were summarized by becker & wolff ( 2005 ) .",
    "dynamical comptonization has been considered by a number of previous authors in a variety of astrophysical situations , including spherical inflows ( payne & blandford 1981 ; colpi 1988 ; schneider & bogdan 1989 ; titarchuk , mastichiadis , & kylafis 1997 ) , accretion disks around black holes ( laurent & titarchuk 2001 ; titarchuk , cui , & wood 2002 ; titarchuk & shrader 2002 ) , spherical outflows ( becker & begelman 1986 ; titarchuk , kazanas , & becker 2003 ) , and the transport of cosmic rays in the solar wind ( parker 1965 ; stawicki , fichtner , & schlickeiser 2000 ) .",
    "the process was also studied in the context of neutron star accretion by titarchuk , mastichiadis , & kylafis ( 1996 ) and mastichiadis & kylafis ( 1992 ) , although their results are not applicable to x - ray pulsar accretion columns due to the assumption of spherical symmetry and the imposition of a power - law velocity profile .",
    "lyubarskii & sunyaev ( 1982 ) analyzed dynamical comptonization in the context of plane - parallel pulsar shocks , but the velocity profile they utilized is not consistent with the dynamics of x - ray pulsar accretion , and furthermore they did not account for the escape of radiation through the walls of the column .",
    "the relevance of the bulk comptonization process for spectral formation in x - ray pulsars was also recognized by burnard , arons , & klein ( 1991 ) , who pointed out that thermal spectra alone are much too soft to explain the observed emission , and suggested that upscattering in the shock could provide the required hardening .",
    "the fundamental character of the green s function describing both thermal and bulk comptonization was studied by titarchuk & zannias ( 1998 ) for the case of accretion onto a black hole .",
    "these authors established that the green s function can be approximated using a broken power - law form with a central peak between the high- and low - energy portions of the spectrum , for either type of comptonization .",
    "furthermore , they concluded that bulk comptonization dominates over the thermal process if the electron temperature @xmath5k .",
    "the theory developed in the present paper represents an extension of the same idea to neutron star accretion , resulting in the exact green s function for the x - ray pulsar spectral formation process . in agreement with titarchuk & zannias ( 1998 ) , we find that the bulk comptonization process is dominant for the temperature range relevant for x - ray pulsars .",
    "however , the presence of the event horizon in the black - hole application treated by these authors makes their problem fundamentally different from the neutron star accretion problem studied here , because the neutron star obviously possesses a solid surface .",
    "our work therefore represents the first exact , quantitative analysis of the role of bulk comptonization in the x - ray pulsar spectral formation process .",
    "radiation pressure governs the dynamical structure of the accretion flows in bright pulsars when the x - ray luminosity satisfies ( becker 1998 ; basko & sunyaev 1976 ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the polar cap radius , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the stellar mass and radius , respectively , @xmath10 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the electron scattering cross sections for photons propagating parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "when the luminosity of the system is comparable to @xmath13 , the radiation flux in the column is super - eddington and therefore the radiation pressure greatly exceeds the gas pressure ( becker 1998 ) . in this situation",
    "the gas passes through a radiation - dominated shock on its way to the stellar surface , and the kinetic energy of the gas is carried away by the high - energy radiation that escapes from the column .",
    "the strong gradient of the radiation pressure decelerates the material to rest at the surface of the star .",
    "the observation of many x - ray pulsars with @xmath14 implies the presence of radiation - dominated shocks close to the stellar surfaces in these systems ( white et al .",
    "1983 ; white et al .",
    "note that radiation - dominated shocks are _ continuous _ velocity transitions , with an overall thickness of a few thomson scattering lengths , unlike traditional ( discontinuous ) gas - dominated shocks ( blandford & payne 1981b ) .",
    "in luminous x - ray pulsars , the pressure of the radiation determines the dynamics of the flow , while the dynamics in turn determines the shape of the radiation spectrum .",
    "hence the flow dynamics and the radiative transport are intimately connected , which makes this a complex and nonlinear `` photohydrodynamical '' problem .",
    "one implication is that the photons scattering through the column can not be regarded as `` test particles '' since it is their pressure that dictates the structure of the flow .",
    "we must therefore solve for the radiation spectrum and the velocity profile in a self - consistent manner .",
    "radiation pressure may also play an important role in the dynamics of moderate - luminosity pulsars due to the strong dependence of the electron scattering ( cyclotron ) cross section on the magnetic field strength ( langer & rappaport 1982 ) .",
    "becker ( 1998 ) and basko & sunyaev ( 1976 ) have considered the dynamics of radiation - dominated pulsar accretion flows , including the effect of the shock and the escape of radiation energy from the column .",
    "they find that the gas is decelerated to zero velocity in a manner consistent with accretion onto a solid body , but they do not consider the shape of the escaping radiation spectrum .",
    "conversely , the dynamics and the radiation spectrum have been worked out self - consistently by blandford & payne ( 1981b ) for the case of a `` standard '' ( rankine - hugoniot ) radiation - dominated shock , which does not include radiation escape . in the blandford & payne approach , the radiation spectrum everywhere in the flow is determined by solving the transport equation using the incident radiation field as a boundary condition .",
    "the solutions have a power - law character at high energies , with a spectral index that depends on the mach number of the upstream flow .",
    "since the rankine - hugoniot shocks studied by blandford & payne have a conserved energy flux , the downstream velocity is never less than one - seventh its upstream value .",
    "consequently the associated spectral solutions are not applicable to the x - ray pulsar case , since pulsar shocks must be _ radiative _ in nature so that the kinetic energy of the infalling material can be removed and the flow brought to rest at the stellar surface .",
    "the analytical approach employed here parallels the work of blandford & payne ( 1981b ) , except that the velocity profile they utilized is replaced with the appropriate solution for an x - ray pulsar accretion column , and the loss of radiation energy from the column is incorporated into the transport equation using an escape - probability formalism . in the spirit of the blandford & payne study of spectral formation in radiation",
    "dominated rankine - hugoniot shocks , we are interested here in exploring the direct effect of the radiative accretion shock on the spectrum emerging from an x - ray pulsar .",
    "hence it is not our goal in this paper to develop complete models that include additional processes such as free - free emission and absorption , cyclotron features , and iron emission lines .",
    "however , even without including any of these processes , we are able to demonstrate qualitative agreement with x - ray pulsar spectra .",
    "this suggests that energization in the accretion shock is one of the most important aspects of spectral formation in x - ray pulsars .",
    "-1.0truein    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly review the conservation equations and discuss the resulting dynamical solution for the velocity profile of the accreting gas .",
    "the transport equation governing the scattering of the radiation inside the accretion column is analyzed in   3 , and various constraints",
    "are derived in order to ensure that the radiative transfer is modeled in a manner consistent with the flow dynamics . in ",
    "4 we obtain the exact analytical solution for the green s function and convolve it with the planck distribution emitted at the thermal mound to compute the radiation spectrum emerging from the accretion column . in   5 we present results obtained for the count - rate spectra using parameters corresponding to specific pulsars ,",
    "and we compare the theoretical spectra with the observational data .",
    "the implications of our results for the production of x - ray spectra in pulsars are discussed in   7 .",
    "additional mathematical details are provided in a series of appendices .",
    "the model analyzed here is based on the dynamical picture suggested by davidson ( 1973 ) , which is illustrated schematically in figure  1 .",
    "the accretion scenario corresponds physically to the flow of a mixture of gas and radiation inside a magnetic `` pipe '' that is sealed with respect to the gas , but is transparent with respect to the radiation .",
    "the accretion column incorporates a radiation - dominated , radiative shock located above the stellar surface .",
    "although the shock is extended and the velocity profile is continuous , the flow possesses a well - defined sonic surface , as indicated in figure  1 .",
    "the model also includes a dense thermal mound located at the base of the flow , where local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails . due to its blackbody nature , the thermal mound acts as both a photon source ( emitting a planck spectrum ) and a photon sink ( absorbing all incident radiation ) .",
    "hence the surface of the mound represents the `` photosphere '' for photon creation and absorption , and the opacity is dominated by electron scattering above this point .    in our approach to the problem , we assume that the upstream flow is composed of pure , fully ionized hydrogen gas moving at a highly supersonic speed , which is the standard scenario for accretion - powered x - ray pulsars ( basko & sunyaev 1975 , 1976 ) .",
    "our transport model employs a cylindrical , plane - parallel geometry , and therefore the velocity , density , and pressure are functions of the distance above the stellar surface , but they are all constant across the column at a given height .",
    "in this situation , the vertical variation of the flow velocity is given by the exact analytical solution obtained by becker ( 1998 ) and basko & sunyaev ( 1976 ) , which describes the settling of the transonic flow onto the surface of the star .",
    "a detailed consideration of the angular and energy dependences of the electron scattering cross section is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we shall therefore follow wang & frank ( 1981 ) and becker ( 1998 ) by treating the directional dependence of the electron scattering in an approximate way in terms of the energy - averaged cross sections @xmath11 and @xmath12 , describing respectively the scattering of photons propagating either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the gas in the accretion column is radiation - dominated , and therefore it is the pressure of the photons that decelerates the infalling plasma to rest .",
    "we will use this fact in   6.1 to evaluate the self - consistency of the coupled radiative transport / dynamical model based on the analytical solution for the radiation pressure profile obtained below .",
    "the one - dimensional , time - dependent euler equations governing the flow of a radiation - dominated gas with mass density @xmath15 , flow velocity @xmath16 , and photon energy density @xmath17 inside a cylindrical accretion column are @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 where the mass , momentum , and energy fluxes are given respectively by @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 with @xmath24 denoting the radiation pressure . the spatial coordinate @xmath25 increases along the column axis , in the direction of the flow , and @xmath26 denotes the associated electron - scattering optical depth , which is related to @xmath25 via @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the electron number density",
    ", @xmath29 is the proton mass , and @xmath11 is the electron scattering cross section parallel to the magnetic field ( i.e. , the column axis ) .",
    "the two coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 are calibrated so that they each vanish at the sonic point , as explained below .",
    "the quantities @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 appearing in equation  ( [ eq2.3 ] ) represent the rates per unit volume at which radiation energy escapes through the column walls , or is absorbed or emitted by the gas , respectively .",
    "when the system is radiation - dominated as assumed here , the gas itself has little thermal energy to contribute to the radiation field , although it does possess a large reservoir of _ bulk _ kinetic energy which is transferred to the photons through the first - order fermi energization process in the shock .",
    "in this situation , the emission and absorption processes must nearly balance throughout the flow , and therefore we can write @xmath33 in which case equation  ( [ eq2.3 ] ) reduces in a steady state to @xmath34 although emission and absorption do not effect the flow dynamics in this situation , these processes profoundly influence the _ shape _ of the radiation spectrum , as discussed in    3 and  4",
    "within the context of our one - dimensional picture , the rate at which radiation energy diffuses through the walls of the column can be approximated using an escape - probability formalism .",
    "if the column cross section is optically thick to electron scattering , as expected , then the rate at which radiation energy escapes through the walls is given by @xmath35 where the mean escape time , @xmath36 , is given by @xmath37 with @xmath38 denoting the diffusion velocity perpendicular to the @xmath25-axis , and @xmath39 representing the perpendicular optical thickness of the cylindrical accretion column with radius @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath39 and @xmath36 are functions of @xmath25 through their dependence on @xmath41 .",
    "becker ( 1998 ) confirmed that the diffusion approximation employed in equation  ( [ eq2.10 ] ) is valid because @xmath42 for typical x - ray pulsar parameters .",
    "equations  ( [ eq2.4 ] ) and ( [ eq2.11 ] ) can be combined to express the mean escape time as @xmath43 since the escape timescale is inversely proportional to the flow velocity , the column becomes completely opaque at the surface of the neutron star due to the divergence of the electron number density there .",
    "the relationship between the escape - probability approximation and the physical distribution of radiation inside the accretion column is further discussed in   6.3 .      in the steady - state situation of interest here , the mass flux @xmath44 and the momentum flux @xmath45 are both conserved , but the energy flux @xmath46 decreases as the gas accretes onto the surface of the neutron star due to the emission of radiation through the column walls .",
    "the momentum , energy , and mass conservation equations can be combined in this case to show that the flow velocity @xmath16 satisfies the second - order nonlinear differential equation ( becker 1998 ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 here , @xmath49 represents the flow velocity at the sonic point , where we set @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with the radiation mach number @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 the quantity @xmath54 denotes the speed of sound in the radiation - dominated gas . in the far upstream region",

    "the height above the stellar surface @xmath65 is related to the coordinate @xmath25 via @xmath66 the incident ( upstream ) velocity of the infalling material is expected to be close to the free - fall velocity onto the stellar surface , @xmath67 , given by @xmath68 since @xmath69 in the upstream region according to equation  ( [ eq2.19 ] ) , it follows that @xmath70 , and therefore the flow velocity at the sonic point is given by @xmath71 with the velocity solution given by equation  ( [ eq2.19 ] ) , the corresponding pressure profile can be obtained by combining equations  ( [ eq2.4 ] ) and ( [ eq2.5 ] ) , which yields @xmath72 the pressure increases to a maximum value at the surface of the star , where @xmath73 . based on equations  ( [ eq2.4 ] ) and ( [ eq2.15 ] ) , we can reexpress the mach number as @xmath74 since the mach number approaches infinity in the far upstream region and @xmath69 , it follows that @xmath75 must vanish asymptotically and consequently the upstream momentum flux is dominated by the ram pressure of the freely falling matter .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath76 by combining equations  ( [ eq2.23 ] ) , ( [ eq2.24 ] ) and ( [ eq2.25 ] ) , we find that the pressure profile is related to the velocity variation by @xmath77 \\ .",

    "if the gas is radiation - dominated and fully ionized , then the photons interact with the matter primarily via electron scattering , which controls both the spatial transport and the energization of the radiation . in this situation",
    "the opacity is dominated by electron scattering , and therefore absorption is negligible , except at the surface of the thermal mound located inside the cylindrical accretion column at @xmath83 .",
    "we are interested in obtaining the photon distribution , @xmath84 , measured at position @xmath25 and energy @xmath85 resulting from the reprocessing of blackbody radiation emitted from the mound .",
    "the normalization of @xmath86 is defined so that @xmath87 gives the number density of photons in the energy range between @xmath85 and @xmath88 , and therefore @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the occupation number .",
    "the self - consistency of the solution obtained for the radiation distribution @xmath86 will be confirmed by verifying that the associated pressure distribution agrees with the dynamical result given by equation  ( [ eq2.27 ] ) .      in the cylindrical geometry employed here , the photon distribution @xmath86 satisfies the transport equation ( e.g. , blandford & payne 1981a ; becker 1992 ; parker 1965 ; becker & wolff 2005 ) @xmath91 where @xmath85 is the photon energy , @xmath25 is the spatial coordinate along the column axis , and @xmath92 is the flow velocity at the top of the thermal mound .",
    "the terms on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) represent advection , first - order fermi energization ( `` bulk comptonization '' ) in the converging flow , spatial diffusion parallel to the column axis , the blackbody source , escape of radiation from the column , and the absorption of radiation at the thermal mound , respectively .",
    "we are interested here in the steady - state version of equation  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) with @xmath93 .",
    "the photon number and energy densities associated with the distribution @xmath86 are given respectively by @xmath94 in the present application , we are primarily interested in exploring the effect of the dynamics itself ( i.e. , the radiative shock ) on the observed x - ray emission .",
    "the transport equation  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) therefore does not include additional processes such as thermal comptonization or cyclotron emission and absorption that are likely to be important in x - ray pulsars .",
    "in general , the neglect of thermal comptonization is reasonable because at the temperatures typical of x - ray pulsars ( @xmath95k ) , the kinetic energy associated with the bulk flow far surpasses the thermal energy .",
    "however , the failure to include the electron recoil associated with thermal comptonization renders the model unable to reproduce the quasi - exponential cutoffs often observed in x - ray pulsar spectra at high energies .",
    "furthermore , in some sources thermal comptonization appears to be necessary in order to flatten the spectrum in the energy range @xmath96kev .",
    "we provide further discussion of this issue in   7 .",
    "when integrated over the photon energy spectrum , the first - order fermi process considered here corresponds to the @xmath97 work done on the radiation by the compression of the background plasma as it accretes onto the stellar surface .",
    "the mean escape time , @xmath36 , is given by equation  ( [ eq2.12 ] ) , and the source term @xmath98 is defined so that @xmath99 represents the number of photons injected into the accretion column per second in the energy range between @xmath85 and @xmath100 from the blackbody surface at @xmath83 .",
    "the absorption term in equation  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) containing the dimensionless constant @xmath101 must be included due to the blackbody nature of the thermal mound , which acts as both a source and a sink of radiation . in the radiation - dominated situation considered here ,",
    "essentially all of the pressure is provided by the photons , and therefore the rate of absorption of radiation energy at the top of the mound must equal the energy emission rate when integrated with respect to the photon frequency ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq2.8 ] ] ) .",
    "we will use this energy balance argument to compute a self - consistent value for @xmath101 below .",
    "next we need to specify the appropriate form for the source term @xmath98 in order to treat the injection of the blackbody radiation from the surface of the thermal mound .",
    "the flux per unit energy measured at the surface of an isotropically radiating object is equal to @xmath102 times the intensity ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "it therefore follows that the amount of energy emitted per second from the upper surface of the thermal mound ( with area @xmath103 ) in the energy range between @xmath85 and @xmath100 is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 denotes the blackbody intensity and @xmath106 is the gas temperature at the surface of the mound .",
    "note that the units for @xmath107 are @xmath108 .",
    "hence we obtain for the source term @xmath109 and consequently the total energy injection rate is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the stephan - boltzmann constant .      in a radiation - dominated x - ray pulsar accretion column ,",
    "the emission of fresh blackbody radiation energy at the surface of the thermal mound is almost perfectly balanced by the absorption of energy , as expressed by equation  ( [ eq2.8 ] ) .",
    "most of the energy appearing in the emergent x - rays is therefore not supplied from the internal energy of the gas , but rather from its bulk kinetic energy , which is transferred directly to the photons via collisions with infalling electrons .",
    "we can gain some insight into the energy balance at the thermal mound by rewriting the steady - state version of the transport equation  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) in the flux - conservation form ( skilling 1975 ; gleeson & axford 1967 ) @xmath112 where @xmath113 represents the `` specific flux '' ( becker 1992 ) . by operating on equation  ( [ eq3.7 ] ) with @xmath114 and utilizing equations  ( [ eq3.2 ] ) and ( [ eq3.6 ] )",
    ", we arrive at the photon energy equation @xmath115 where the integrated photon energy flux , @xmath116 , is given by @xmath117 equation  ( [ eq3.9 ] ) states that the divergence of the radiation energy flux @xmath116 is equal to the net rate of change of the photon energy density @xmath17 due to the combined influence of compression , escape , absorption , and photon injection .",
    "note that @xmath116 is related to the _ total _ energy flux @xmath46 via ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq2.6 ] ] ) @xmath118 since the absorption and emission of radiation energy must balance at the surface of the mound in the radiation - dominated situation of interest here , we can integrate equation  ( [ eq3.9 ] ) with respect to @xmath25 across the mound location to obtain @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes the radiation energy density at the mound surface .",
    "the fact that the photon energy flux @xmath116 is continuous at @xmath83 therefore requires that the dimensionless absorption constant @xmath101 in the transport equation  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) be given by @xmath121 by utilizing this expression for @xmath101 , we ensure that the results obtained for the radiation spectrum @xmath84 are consistent with the dynamical structure of the accretion column .",
    "this is confirmed after the fact by calculating the radiation pressure @xmath122 using equation  ( [ eq3.2 ] ) and comparing the result with the dynamical solution given by equation  ( [ eq2.27 ] ) .",
    "in our approach to solving equation  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) for the spectrum @xmath84 inside the accretion column , we shall first obtain the green s function , @xmath123 , which is the radiation distribution at location @xmath25 and energy @xmath85 resulting from the injection of @xmath124 photons per second with energy @xmath125 from a monochromatic source at location @xmath126 .",
    "the determination of the green s function is a useful intermediate step in the process because it provides us with fundamental physical insight into the spectral redistribution process , and it also allows us to calculate the particular solution for the spectrum @xmath86 associated with an arbitrary continuum source @xmath98 using the integral convolution ( becker 2003 ) @xmath127 note that the upper bound of integration is set equal to @xmath85 because in our model all of the injected photons gain energy via the first - order fermi process , and none lose energy .",
    "the technical procedure used to solve for the green s function involves the derivation of eigenfunctions and associated eigenvalues based on the set of spatial boundary conditions for the problem ( see , e.g. , blandford & payne 1981b ; payne & blandford 1981 ; schneider & kirk 1987 ; colpi 1988 ) .",

    "note that in model  2 the thermal mound is essentially on the surface of the star , whereas in model  1 there is a much larger separation .",
    "this reflects the fact that the accretion rate in model  1 is over 800 times larger than in model  2 .",
    "the results obtained for the first eigenvalue and for the photon index in model  1 are @xmath299 and @xmath300 , respectively . in model  2",
    ", we find that the spectrum is significantly steeper , with @xmath301 and @xmath302 . the steeper spectrum obtained in model  2 results from the large value obtained for @xmath101 , as indicated in table  1 .",
    "in general , the escaping spectrum has a power - law shape at high energies , as expected for a fermi process , and a low - energy turnover due to the planck distribution of the seed photons .",
    "note that the emitted radiation is concentrated in a layer just above the thermal mound location , around @xmath225 .",
    "this reflects the fact that advection due to collisions with the infalling stream of high - speed electrons tends to keep the photons trapped at low altitudes in the column , and therefore few of them are able to escape through the column walls for @xmath303 .",
    "since the spin axis and the column axis are not aligned in pulsars , the portion of the accretion column visible along the line of sight to the earth changes as the pulsar rotates . when combined with the vertical variation of the energy dependence of the escaping photon distribution",
    ", this effect will produce a pulse - phase dependence in the observed x - ray spectrum .    in figures  9 and 10",

    "the 4u  1258 - 61 data was reported by white et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , and the 4u  0352 + 30 data is the result of xspec analysis of an archival rxte observation taken in july 1998 and reported by delgado - mart et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . based on estimates from negueruela ( 1998 ) ,",
    "the values adopted for the distance @xmath305 are 2.5kpc for 4u  1258 - 61 and 0.35kpc for 4u  0352 + 30 .",
    "the observational data represent the de - convolved ( incident ) spectra , which depend weakly on the detector response model .",
    "the theoretical spectra were computed using 20 eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for high accuracy , and various amounts of interstellar absorption were included as indicated in the figures .    although the results presented here are not fits to the data , we note that the general shape of the pulsar spectrum predicted by the theory agrees fairly well with the observations in each case , including both the turnover at low energies and the power law at higher energies .",
    "several other sources yield similar agreement . in our model ,",
    "the turnover at @xmath307kev is due to planckian photons that escape from the accretion column without experiencing many scatterings .",
    "this effect will tend to reduce the amount of absorption required to fit the observational data , compared with the amount required using the standard ad hoc models usually employed in x - ray pulsar spectral analysis ( see the discussion in hickox , narayan , & kallman 2004 ) .    the second source , x  persei , presents an interesting test for the model due to its relatively low luminosity , @xmath308 .",
    "the agreement between the theory and the observations suggests that radiation pressure may still be playing an important role in the dynamics of this source , despite its low luminosity .",
    "in fact , langer & rappaport ( 1982 ) pointed out that radiation pressure may have a strong effect on the flow dynamics of low - luminosity pulsars if the photon energies are close to the cyclotron resonance , which greatly increases the electron scattering cross section .",
    "furthermore , the dynamical importance of the gas pressure in this luminosity range may lead to the development of a gas - mediated `` subshock '' within the overall gradual compression of the radiation - dominated shock .",
    "this type of hybrid shock is analogous to the `` two - fluid '' model of cosmic - ray mediated supernova shocks ( e.g. , drury & vlk 1981 ) .",
    "it is know that in the cosmic - ray case , multiple flow solutions can occur for the same set of upstream boundary conditions ( e.g. , becker & kazanas 2001 ) .",
    "there is some possibility that the same type of multi - state behavior may occur in x - ray pulsars , which could have interesting observational implications .",
    "the analytical approach employed in this paper is based on the conservation of energy and momentum in the radiation - dominated flow .",
    "this leads to the self - consistent determination of the thermal mound location , @xmath126 , for given values of the fundamental parameters @xmath40 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 , as discussed in   5.1 . in this section",
    "we verify that the model satisfies the self - consistency conditions required for global energy conservation .",
    "we also examine the implications of the one - dimensional escape probability formalism that has been utilized to model the emission of radiation from the column .",
    "the exact dynamical solution for the radiation pressure inside the pulsar accretion column is given by equation  ( [ eq2.27 ] ) , which states that @xmath309 where @xmath63 is the distance between the sonic point and the stellar surface , given by equation  ( [ eq2.20 ] ) . in principle , the radiation pressure can also be computed by integrating the particular solution for the photon distribution @xmath86 inside the accretion column . since @xmath24 , we can use equation  ( [ eq3.2 ] ) to write @xmath310 where @xmath86 is computed using the convolution ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq4.1 ] ] ) @xmath311 here , the blackbody source @xmath240 is given by equation  ( [ eq3.5 ] ) and the green s function @xmath198 is evaluated using equation  ( [ eq4.25 ] ) , bearing in mind that the quantities @xmath146 and @xmath147 are interchangeable via equations  ( [ eq4.4 ] ) and ( [ eq4.9 ] ) .",
    "we can check the accuracy of the entire solution technique , including the determination of the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues , by comparing the exact dynamical result for @xmath75 with that obtained by integrating the spectrum . in figure  11 we plot the exact analytical solution for the radiation pressure computed using equation  ( [ eq5.19 ] ) along with the results obtained by integrating the model  1 and 2 spectra using equation  ( [ eq5.20 ] ) .",
    "note that the agreement between the various solutions for @xmath75 is excellent , and in each case the pressure achieves the correct stagnation value @xmath312 ( eq .  [ [ eq2.28 ] ] ) as the gas approaches the stellar surface .",
    "the agreement between the various results for the pressure confirms that our solution for the radiation spectrum is consistent with the dynamics of the accretion flow .      in order to further explore the self - consistency of the formalism developed here ,",
    "we have also computed the total x - ray luminosity , @xmath313 , emerging from the column by integrating the escaping number spectrum @xmath274 ( eq .  [ [ eq4.44 ] ] ) using @xmath314 we have confirmed that the values obtained using this expression agree precisely with the accretion luminosity given by @xmath315 the calculations performed in this section and in   6.1 validate our entire solution procedure for the determination of the radiation spectrum by demonstrating that our results are fully consistent with global energy conservation .      within the context of our one - dimensional model ,",
    "the diffusion of radiation through the walls of the accretion column is treated in an approximate manner using an escape - probability formalism . in this approach ,",
    "the probability per unit time that a randomly - selected photon at location @xmath25 inside the column will escape through the walls is equal to @xmath316 , where the mean escape time @xmath36 is a function of @xmath25 given by ( see eqs .  [ [ eq2.11 ] ] ) @xmath317 with @xmath40 and @xmath12 denoting the radius of the cylindrical column and the electron scattering cross section for photons propagating perpendicular to the column axis , respectively .",
    "the escape of radiation through the walls of the accretion column can therefore be modeled approximately using a term of the form @xmath318 which is incorporated into the transport equation  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) .    from a technical point of view",
    ", the utilization of the escape - probability formalism implies that the distribution of the photon number density across the column is proportional to the first eigenfunction of the operator describing the diffusion of radiation perpendicular to the column axis ( e.g. , sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) . in a comprehensive , multidimensional calculation ,",
    "the diffusion of photons perpendicular to the column axis is treated by replacing the escape - probability term @xmath319 in the transport equation  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) with the more rigorous expression @xmath320 where @xmath321 is the radial coordinate measured from the central axis of the cylindrical accretion column .",
    "if the gas density is constant across the column at a given height , as assumed here , then equation  ( [ eq5.26 ] ) can be separated to obtain for the first eigenfunction the solution @xmath322 where @xmath323 is a constant , @xmath324 denotes the first eigenvalue , @xmath325 represents the zeroth - order bessel function , and @xmath326 is the electron scattering mean free path for photons propagating perpendicular to the column axis .",
    "the value of @xmath324 is determined by satisfying the flux boundary condition at the surface of the column . by employing the eddington approximation ,",
    "we can write the boundary condition as @xmath327 where @xmath328 is a positive constant of order unity and we have assumed that no radiation is incident on the column from the outside . the precise value of @xmath328 is somewhat arbitrary , with rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) setting @xmath329 and sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1980 ) setting @xmath330 . combining equations  ( [ eq5.27 ] ) and ( [ eq5.29 ] )",
    ", we find that @xmath324 is the smallest positive root of the equation @xmath331 where @xmath332 denotes the order - unity bessel function .    the rate of change of the first eigenfunction ( eq .  [ [ eq5.27 ] ] )",
    "is given by @xmath333 comparison of equations  ( [ eq5.25 ] ) and ( [ eq5.31 ] ) reveals that the escape - probability approximation and the rigorous diffusion model yield the same result for the logarithmic time derivative @xmath334 if the mean escape time @xmath36 and the first eigenvalue @xmath324 are related via @xmath335 this equation is well satisfied in all of our sample calculations , which suggests that the escape - probability formalism provides a reasonable description of the leakage of photons from the accretion column .",
    "we have shown that the simplified model considered here , comprising a radiation - dominated accretion column with a blackbody source / sink at its base and a radiative shock , is able to reproduce the power - law continuum spectra observed in accretion - powered x - ray pulsars with a range of luminosities , as indicated in figures  9 and 10 .",
    "our results represent the first ab initio calculations of the x - ray spectrum associated with the physical accretion scenario first suggested by davidson ( 1973 ) . for given values of the stellar mass @xmath251 and the stellar radius @xmath252 ,",
    "our model has only three free parameters , namely the column radius @xmath40 , the temperature at the top of the thermal mound @xmath253 , and the accretion rate @xmath254 .",
    "we have confirmed that the solution obtained for the radiation spectrum is consistent with the dynamics of the flow in the accretion column ( see fig .",
    "many pulsars are found to have spectra that are well fitted using a combination of a power - law plus a blackbody component , but until now this form has been adopted in a purely ad hoc manner .",
    "the new model described here finally provides a firm theoretical foundation for this empirical result .",
    "our analytical solution , based on a rigorous eigenfunction expansion , is relatively straightforward to implement computationally because it avoids numerical integration of the transport equation .",
    "the work presented here therefore represents a significant step in the development of a comprehensive theory for the spectral formation process in x - ray pulsars .",
    "the photon spectral index @xmath185 is related to the first eigenvalue @xmath184 via @xmath336 , and therefore the leading eigenvalue determines the slope of the high - energy portion of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the value of @xmath185 is quite sensitive to the strength of the absorption at the thermal mound , which is determined by the parameter @xmath101 . according to equation  ( [ eq5.13 ] ) , @xmath101 in turn",
    "is a strong function of the mound temperature @xmath253 .",
    "the higher the temperature , the stronger the emission and absorption at the blackbody surface of the mound .",
    "model  2 has a higher temperature than model  1 , and therefore the value of @xmath101 is larger .",
    "hence the spectrum is steeper in model  2 because the photons spend less time on average upscattering in the flow before either escaping through the column walls or being `` recycled '' by absorption at the mound location .",
    "acceptable values for @xmath185 , in the range between 2 and 4 , are obtained for reasonable source parameters , as indicated in figures  2 and 6 .",
    "although a broad range of spectral indices can be produced , we must have @xmath337 in order to avoid an infinite photon energy density since the model considered here does not include a high - energy cutoff .",
    "the shape of the green s function spectrum derived here is qualitatively similar to the results obtained using the `` bulk motion comptonization '' model coded into the xspec package using the bmc function ( see shrader & titarchuk 1998 , 1999 ; borozdin et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the bmc model includes parameters corresponding to the high - energy spectral index , the temperature of the soft photon source , the fraction of the comptonized component in the resulting spectrum , and the size of the emitting region .",
    "however , the bmc model is designed to treat spectral formation in black - hole accretion flows , whereas our focus here is on neutron star accretion .",
    "hence the model developed in this paper can be viewed as a parallel formalism that is optimized for the treatment of the spectral formation process in accretion - powered x - ray pulsars . in this sense",
    ", our theory translates the free parameters of a generalized bulk comptonization model into specific values for the accretion rate , temperature , and column radius for a particular x - ray pulsar .",
    "our goal in this paper is to explore the direct role of the accretion shock in producing the observed continuum spectra in x - ray pulsars via the first - order fermi process .",
    "although the model produces spectra that are quite similar to those observed from several x - ray pulsars , it can not explain the spectra from other sources .",
    "for example , the observed spectra for several of the brightest pulsars with luminosities in the range @xmath338 ( e.g. , her  x-1 ) are very flat power - laws leading up to a sharp exponential cutoff .",
    "the photon index in these sources is typically @xmath339 , which is outside the range allowed by our model since it does not include a high - energy cutoff . in order to understand spectral formation in the brightest pulsars , additional effects such as thermal comptonization ,",
    "cyclotron features , bremsstrahlung , and iron emission must be incorporated into the model . in principle",
    ", one should also consider higher - order relativistic effects that can alter the form of the fundamental transport equation ( psaltis & lamb 1997 ) .",
    "thermal comptonization is particularly important since this process redistributes energy from the highest frequency photons to lower energies via electron recoil .",
    "this naturally leads to the development of a high - energy exponential turnover and a concomitant flattening of the spectrum at moderate energies , as observed .",
    "the thermal comptonization process was studied by lyubarskii & sunyaev ( 1982 ) and becker ( 1988 ) in the context of plane - parallel shocks .",
    "however , the velocity profiles employed by these authors are not consistent with the structure of an x - ray pulsar accretion column .",
    "poutanen & gierliski ( 2003 ) computed x - ray pulsar spectra based on the thermal comptonization of soft radiation in a hot layer above the magnetic pole , but their model did not include a complete treatment of the bulk process , which is of crucial importance in x - ray pulsars . in this paper",
    "we have carefully analyzed the effect of bulk comptonization on the emitted spectrum , while neglecting the corresponding thermal process .",
    "the inclusion of thermal comptonization is beyond the scope of the present paper because it renders the transport equation insoluble via analytical means .",
    "however , in future work we intend to develop a comprehensive numerical model that incorporates both the bulk and thermal processes .",
