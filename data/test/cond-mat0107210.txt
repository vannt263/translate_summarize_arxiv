    "rna is an important biopolymer critical to all living systems  @xcite and may be the crucial entity in prebiotic evolution  @xcite . like for dna , there are four types of nucleotides ( or bases ) a , c , g , and u which , when polymerized can form double helical structures consisting of stacks of stable watson - crick pairs ( a with u or g with c ) . however unlike a long polymer of dna , which is often accompanied by a complementary strand and forms otherwise featureless double helical structures , a polymer of rna usually `` operates '' in the single - strand mode .",
    "it bends onto itself and forms elaborate spatial structures in order for bases located on different parts of the backbone to pair with each other , similar conceptually to how the sequence of an amino acid encodes the structure of a protein .",
    "understanding the encoding of structure from the primary sequence has been an outstanding problem of theoretical biophysics .",
    "most theoretical work in the past decade have been focused on the problem of protein folding , which is very difficult analytically and numerically  @xcite . here , we study the problem of rna folding , specifically the formation of rna _ secondary structures_. for rna , the restriction to secondary structures is meaningful due to a separation of energy scales . it is this restriction that makes the rna folding problem amenable to detailed analytical and numerical studies  @xcite .",
    "there exist efficient algorithms to compute the exact partition function of rna secondary structures  @xcite . together with the availability of carefully measured free energy parameters  @xcite describing the formation of various microscopic structures ( e.g. , stacks , loops , hairpins , etc . )",
    ", the probable secondary structures formed by any given rna molecule of up to a few thousand bases can be obtained readily . on the experimental side , rna molecules of @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath2 bases in length are available .",
    "furthermore , the restriction to secondary structures can be physically enforced in a salt solution with monovalent ions , e.g. , @xmath3 , so that controlled experiments are in principle possible  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we are not concerned with the structure formed by a specific sequence .",
    "instead , we will study the statistics of secondary structures formed by the ensemble of _ long _ _ random _ rna sequences ( of at least a few thousand bases in length in practice ) .",
    "such knowledge may be of value in detecting important structural components in messenger rnas which may otherwise be regarded as random from the structural perspective , in understanding how functional rnas arise from random rna sequences  @xcite , or in characterizing the response of a long single - stranded dna molecule to external pulling forces  @xcite .",
    "more significantly from the theoretical point of view , the rna secondary structure problem presents a rare tractable model of a random heteropolymer where concrete progress can be made regarding the thermodynamic properties  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are many gaps in our understanding .",
    "this paper is a detailed report of our on - going effort in this regard .",
    "it provides a self - contained introduction of the random rna problem to statistical physicists as a novel problem of disordered systems , and depicts several approaches we have tried to characterize this system .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec_secondarystructure ] , we provide a detailed introduction to the phenomenology of rna secondary structure formation .",
    "we review the key simplifications which form the basis of efficient computing as well as exact solutions in some cases .",
    "we also review the properties of the  molten phase \" , which is the simplest possible phase of the system assuming sequence disorder is not relevant . in sec .",
    "[ sec_randomnesshight ] , we consider the effect of sequence disorder at high temperatures . we show numerical evidence that the random rna sequence is in the molten phase at sufficiently high temperatures , and support this conclusion by solving the two - replica system which can be regarded as a perturbative study on the stability of the molten phase . in sec .",
    "[ sec_randomnesslowt ] , we provide a scaling argument , and show why the molten phase should break down at low enough temperatures .",
    "this is followed by a detailed numerical study of the low temperature regime .",
    "we apply the droplet picture and characterize the statistics of large - scale , low - energy excitations of the secondary structures from the ground state structure .",
    "our results support the existence of a very weak ( i.e. , marginal ) glass phase characterized by logarithmic excitation energies .",
    "finally , we describe the intermediate temperature regime where the system makes the transition from the glass phase to the molten phase .",
    "the solution of the two - replica problem is relegated to the appendices .",
    "we present two approaches : in appendix  [ app_intuitive ] , we provide a mapping of the two - replica problem to the denaturation of an effective single rna in @xmath0-dimensional embedding space ; this approach highlights the connection of the rna problem to the self - consistent hartree theory and should be most natural to field theorists . in appendices  [ app_solution ] and  [ app_derivez1 ] , we present the exact solution .",
    "it is hoped that the two - replica solution may be helpful in providing the intuition needed to tackle the full @xmath4-replica problem .",
    "the secondary structure of an rna describes the configuration of base pairings formed by the polymer .",
    "if the pairing of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bases in a polymer of @xmath7 total bases is denoted by @xmath8 with @xmath9 , then each secondary structure @xmath10 is defined by a list of such pairings , with each position appearing at most once in the list , and with the pairs subject to a certain restriction to be described shortly below .",
    "each such structure can be represented by a diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagrams ] , where the solid line symbolizes the backbone of the molecule and the dashed lines stand for base pairings .",
    "the structure shown can be divided into _ stems _ of consecutive base pairs and _ loops _ which connect or terminate these stems . in naturally occurring rna molecules ,",
    "the stems typically comprise on the order of five base pairs .",
    "they locally form the same double helical structure as dna molecules . however , while the latter typically occur in complementary pairs and bind to each other , rna molecules are mostly single - stranded and hence must fold back onto themselves in order to gain some base pairings .            by a secondary structure ,",
    "one often considers only the restricted set of base pairings where any two base pairs @xmath8 and @xmath11 in a given secondary structure are either independent , i.e. , @xmath12 , or nested , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "this excludes the so - called pseudo - knots ( as exemplified by fig .  [ fig_pseudoknot ] ) and makes analytical and numerical studies much more tractable . for an rna molecule ,",
    "the exclusion of pseudo - knots is a reasonable approximation because the long pseudo - knots are kinetically difficult to form , and even the short ones occur infrequently in natural rna structures  @xcite .",
    "the latter is due to their relatively low binding energies for short sequences and the strong electrostatic repulsion of the backbone  because the polymer backbone is highly charged and pseudo - knotted configurations increase the density of the molecule , their formation can be relatively disfavored in low salt solution .",
    "similarly , the tertiary structures which involve additional interactions of paired bases are strongly dependent on electrostatic screening and can be  turned off \" experimentally by using monovalent salt solution  @xcite . indeed , the pseudo - knots are often deemed part of the tertiary structure of an rna molecule . throughout this study , we will exclude pseudo - knots in our definition of secondary structures . without the pseudo - knots ,",
    "a secondary structure can alternatively be represented by a diagram of non - crossing arches or by a ",
    "mountain \" diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_strreps ] .    : in ( a ) the solid line symbolizes the stretched out backbone of the molecule while the dashed arches stand for the base pairs formed . due to",
    "the no pseudo - knot constraint two arches never cross .",
    "( b ) shows an equivalent representation as a `` mountain diagram '' .",
    "it is a line derived from the arch diagram by going along the backbone from left to right and going one step up for every beginning arch , horizontally for each unbound base , and one step down for each ending arch .",
    "such a mountain always stays above the baseline and comes back to the baseline at base @xmath7 . ]      in order to calculate boltzmann factors within an ensemble of secondary structures , we need to assign an energy @xmath14 $ ] to each structure @xmath10 .",
    "each secondary structure can be decomposed into elementary pieces such as the stems of base pairs and the connecting loop regions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagrams ] .",
    "a common approach is to assume that the contributions from these structural elements to the total energy are independent of each other and additive .    within a stem of base pairs ,",
    "the largest energy contribution is the _ stacking energy _ between two adjacent base pairs ( g - c , a - u , or g - u ) , and the total energy of the stem is the sum of stacking energies over all adjacent base pairs . since each secondary structure is defined as a _",
    "single _ state in our ensemble , it is necessary to integrate out all other microscopic degrees of freedom of the bases within a given secondary structure and use an effective energy parameter for each base stacking .",
    "the most convenient one to use is the gibbs free energy of stacking  @xcite , which contains an enthalpic term due to base stacking , and an entropic term due to the loss of single - stranded degrees of freedom ( as well as the additional conformational change of the backbone and even the surrounding water molecules ) due to base pairing .",
    "the magnitudes of these stacking free energies actually depend on the identity of all four bases forming the two base pairs bracketing the stack and are dependent on temperature themselves . while their typical values are on the order of @xmath15 at room temperature , the enthalpic and entropic contributions are each on the order of @xmath16 .",
    "thus , upon moderately increasing the temperature from room temperature to about @xmath17 , the stacking free energies become repulsive and the rna molecule denatures .",
    "the stacking free energies account for most but not all of the entropic terms for a given secondary structure .",
    "there is an additional ( logarithmic ) `` loop energy '' term associated with the entropy loss of each _ closed loop _ of single - stranded rna formed by the secondary structure , as well as the energy necessary to bend the single strand .",
    "all of these energy parameters have been measured in great detail  @xcite . when incorporated into an efficient dynamic programming algorithm ( to be described below ) , they can rather successfully _",
    "predict _ the secondary structures of many rna molecules of up to several hundred bases in length  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the statistical properties of long , random rna sequences far below the denaturation temperature .",
    "we are interested in generic issues such as the existence of a glass phase and various scaling properties .",
    "guided by experiences with other disordered systems  @xcite , we believe these generic properties of the system should not depend on the specific choice of the model details . since the full model used in refs  @xcite makes analytical and numerical studies unnecessarily clumsy , we will examine a number of simplified models , while preserving the most essential feature of the system , namely , the pattern of matches and mismatches between different positions of the sequence .",
    "as in the realistic model described above , we choose our reference energy to be the unbound state , so that each unbound base in a secondary structure is assigned the energy @xmath18 .",
    "we will neglect the logarithmic loop energy , which is important very close to the denaturation transition  @xcite where the average binding energy is close to zero , but not far below the denaturation temperature where most bases are paired .",
    "moreover , we will radically simplify the energy rules for base pairing : we neglect the stacking energies and instead associate an interaction energy @xmath19 with every pairing @xmath8 .",
    "thus , @xmath20=\\sum_{(i , j)\\in s}\\varepsilon_{i , j}\\ ] ] is the total energy of the structure @xmath10 .    within this model , it remains to be decided how to choose the energy parameters @xmath19 s .",
    "one possibility is to choose each of the bases @xmath21 randomly from the ` alphabet ' set @xmath22 and then assign @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the match or mismatch energy respectively . here , the value of @xmath25 is actually not essential as long as it is repulsive , since the two bases always have the energetically preferred option to not bind at all .",
    "thus the energetics of the system is set by @xmath26 . in our numerical study to be reported in secs .",
    "[ sec_randomnesshight ] and  [ sec_randomnesslowt ] , we will primarily use this model ( as long as it is larger than @xmath27 as explained below ) .",
    "indeed the alphabet size and the choice of the matching rule can be used as tuning parameters to change the strength of sequence disorder .",
    "but in our study , we choose to minimize the number of parameters and tune the effective strength of disorder by changing temperature . ] with @xmath28 .",
    "we will refer to this as the `` sequence disorder '' model .    for analytical calculations ,",
    "it is preferable to treat all the @xmath19 s as _ independent _ identically distributed random variables , i.e. , to assume @xmath29=\\prod_{1\\le i < j\\le n}\\rho(\\varepsilon_{i , j})\\ ] ] for the joint distribution function @xmath30 $ ] of all the @xmath19 s .",
    "this choice neglects the correlations between @xmath19 and @xmath31 which are generated through the shared base @xmath32 ; it is an additional approximation on the model ( [ eq_energychoice ] ) .",
    "however , we do not anticipate universal quantities to depend on such subtle correlation of the @xmath19 s .",
    "this will be tested numerically by comparing the behavior of the model ( [ eq_energychoice ] ) with that of the model defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq_uncorrelated ] ) together with @xmath33 this distribution is chosen to mimic the random sequence model ( [ eq_energychoice ] ) with a 4-letter alphabet , but it does not contain any correlation between the different @xmath19 s",
    ". we will refer to this model as defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq_uncorrelated ] ) and ( [ eq_uncorrelateddisorder ] ) as the `` energy disorder '' model .    in the actual analytical calculations",
    ", we will go even one step further and take the @xmath19 to be _ gaussian _ random variables specified by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the average binding energy and @xmath36 is the variance .",
    "in this model ( referred to below as  gaussian disorder \" model , ) the parameter @xmath36 provides us with a convenient measure of the disorder strength .",
    "again , universal quantities should not depend on the choice of the distribution functions .",
    "we will test this directly by performing numerical studies for these gaussian random energies , with @xmath37 chosen to match the first two moments of the distribution eq .",
    "( [ eq_uncorrelateddisorder ] ) .",
    "in contrast to prior numerical studies  @xcite , we do not exclude base pairing between neighboring bases @xmath38 , i.e. , we do not set a minimal allowed length for the hairpins .",
    "since the results are qualitatively identical to the results of the simpler model presented here , we do not show this data . ] . setting a constraint on the minimal hairpin length",
    "would make the analytical study much more cumbersome .",
    "however , in the study by pagnani _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite , it has been argued that the system will not be frustrated ( and hence will not form a glass ) without this additional constraint .",
    "we believe this is an artifact of the 2-letter alphabet used by pagnani _",
    "_ in order to generate the binding energy @xmath19 s via a rule similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq_energychoice ] ) : it is simple to see that for any 2-letter sequence in which the like letters repel and unlike letters attract , one can always find the minimal total binding energy by pairing up neighboring bases of opposite types and removing them from the sequence if no additional constraints such as the minimal hairpin length are enforced . as we will discuss in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec_proofglass ] this is not a problem if the alphabet size is larger than 2 .",
    "thus , in our study , we use the sequence disorder model with a 4-letter alphabet , or the energy disorder model , without enforcing the minimal hairpin length constraint . while the minimal hairpin length ( of 3 bases ) is known for real rna folding",
    ", it should not change the universal properties of long rna sequences .",
    "once the energy of each secondary structure is defined , we can study the partition function @xmath39}\\ ] ] of the molecule where @xmath40 denotes the set of _ all _ allowed secondary structures of a polymer of @xmath7 bases , and @xmath41 . to calculate this partition function ,",
    "it is useful to study the _ restricted _ partition function @xmath42 of the substrand from position @xmath43 to position @xmath44 of the rna molecule . given the model ( [ eq_energy ] ) , the restricted partition functions can be split up according to the possible pairings of position @xmath44 .",
    "this leads to the recursive equation  @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the total partition function of the molecule . in terms of the arch diagrams introduced in fig .",
    "[ fig_strreps](a ) this can be represented as @xmath47{receq.eps}}\\ ] ] where the wavy lines stand for the restricted partition functions .",
    "this is easily recognized as a hartree equation .",
    "since the restricted partition functions on the right hand side of this equation all correspond to shorter pieces of the rna molecule than the left hand side , this equation allows one to calculate the exact partition function of an rna molecule of length @xmath7 with _ arbitrary _",
    "interactions @xmath19 in @xmath48 time .",
    "this is accomplished by starting with the partition functions for single bases and recursively applying eq .",
    "( [ eq_partfuncrec ] ) , and is known as a dynamic programming algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm allows one to compute numerically the partition function involving all secondary structures , for arbitrary rna molecules of up to @xmath49 bases .",
    "it also forms the basis of analytical approaches to the problem as we will see shortly .",
    "apart from the partition function itself , we will use additional observables in order to characterize the behavior of rna secondary structures .",
    "one such quantity of interest is the binding probability @xmath50 , i.e. , the probability that positions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are paired given the @xmath19 s , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is given by the recursion equation  ( [ eq_partfuncrec ] ) and @xmath53 is the partition function of the sequence @xmath54 .",
    "the latter can be calculated as the quantity @xmath55 when applying the recursion eq .",
    "( [ eq_partfuncrec ] ) to the duplicated sequence @xmath56 .",
    "thus , all @xmath57 such constraint partition functions can be calculated with the same recursion in @xmath48 time .",
    "the logarithms @xmath58 of these binding probabilities have a natural interpretation : they can be read as the `` pinching free energies '' , i.e. , as the free energy cost of a pinch between positions @xmath43 and @xmath44 and the unperturbed state .",
    "we will make extensive use of this concept of pinched structures in our discussion of the low temperature behavior of rna secondary structures in sec .",
    "[ sec_randomnesslowt ] . in our numerical investigations , we will choose as a representative of all the pinching energies for different positions by @xmath59 which is the free energy cost of the largest possible pinch that splits the molecule of length @xmath7 into two pieces of length @xmath60 each .",
    "another quantity which describes a secondary structures is its `` size profile '' . as an intrinsic measure of the size of a given secondary structure @xmath10",
    ", we use the `` ladder distance '' @xmath61 between the base at position @xmath62 and the base at position @xmath43 , which is the the number of pairings ( or ladders ) one has to cross to go from a pair involving base @xmath62 to the base @xmath43 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_hdef ] .",
    "it can be defined for each secondary structure @xmath10 as the total number of pairings @xmath63 that bracket @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath64 this quantity can be very easily visualized as the `` height '' at position @xmath43 of the mountain representation of the secondary structure @xmath10 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_strreps](b ) .",
    "a quantity characterizing the full ensemble of secondary structures is the _ thermal average _",
    "@xmath65 of this size profile over all secondary structures with their respective boltzmann factors ; it can be straightforwardly calculated from the probabilities @xmath66 as @xmath67 since we expect all positions in the sequence to behave in a similar way , in our numerics we will summarize the properties of the size profile by the ladder distance from the first to the middle base , i.e. , we will study @xmath68 as a quantity representing the overall `` size '' of an ensemble of secondary structures .     of a secondary rna structure : the size profile measures the extension of the structure if drawn as a planar diagram .",
    "as an intrinsic definition of @xmath69 which captures this notion of the size of a secondary structure at position @xmath43 , we use the `` ladder distance '' of base @xmath43 from the end of the molecule , i.e. , the number of base pairs which have to be crossed when connecting position @xmath43 to position @xmath62 along the folded structure as indicated by the dashed line . ]        if sequence disorder does not play an important role , we may describe the rna molecule by replacing all the binding energies @xmath19 by some effective value @xmath70 . as we will see later , this will be an adequate description of our random rna models at high enough temperatures ( but before denaturation . ) for the real rnas , this provides a coarse grained description of repetitive , self - complementary sequences , e.g. , cagcag ... cag , which are involved in a number of diseases  @xcite .",
    "we will refer to rna which is well described by this model without sequence disorder as being in the `` molten '' phase .",
    "it serves as a starting point for modeling non - specific self - binding of rna molecules , and its properties will form the basis of our study of the random rna at low temperatures .      since in the absence of sequence disorder , the energy of a structure @xmath10 depends only on the number of paired bases @xmath71 of this structure , we can write the partition function in the molten phase as @xmath72\\ ] ] the partition functions of the sub - strands @xmath42 become translationally invariant and can be written as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is only a function of the length @xmath7 .",
    "the recursion equation  ( [ eq_partfuncrec ] ) then takes the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 upon introducing the @xmath77-transform @xmath78 the convolution can be eliminated and the recursion equation turns into a quadratic equation @xmath79 with the solution @xmath80 performing the inverse @xmath77-transformation in the saddle point approximation yields the expression  @xcite @xmath81 in the limit of large @xmath7 , with the exponent @xmath82 and the non - universal quantities @xmath83 and @xmath84^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this result characterizes the state of the rna where a large number of different secondary structures of equal energy coexist in the thermodynamic ensemble , and the partition function is completely dominated by the configurational entropy of these secondary structures . while the result is derived specifically for the special case @xmath85 , we will argue below that it is applicable also to random @xmath19 s at sufficiently high temperatures , in the sense that for long rna molecules , the partition function is dominated by an exponentially large number of secondary structures all having _ comparable _ energies ( within @xmath86 ) that are smoothly related to each other in configuration space .",
    "the latter is what we meant by the `` molten phase '' .",
    "the exponent @xmath82 is an example of a scaling exponent characteristic of the molten phase .",
    "this and other exponents can be derived in a geometric way by the `` mountain '' representation of secondary structures as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_strreps](b ) .",
    "each such mountain corresponds to exactly one secondary structure . in the molten phase ,",
    "the weight of a secondary structure @xmath10 is simply given by @xmath87 .",
    "this can be represented in the mountain picture by assigning a weight of @xmath88 to every upward and downward step and a weight of @xmath62 to every horizontal step .",
    "since the only constraints on these mountains are ( i ) staying above the baseline , and ( ii ) returning to the baseline at the end , the partition function of an rna of length @xmath7 is then simply that of a random walk of @xmath7 steps , constrained to start from and return to the origin , in the presence of a _ hard wall _ at the origin , with the above weights ( @xmath89 or @xmath62 ) assigned to each allowed step .",
    "this partition function is well - known to have the characteristic @xmath90 behavior which we formally derived in the last section  @xcite .    in this framework",
    ", it also becomes obvious why imposing a minimal hairpin length does not change the universal behavior of rna at least in this molten phase : if the minimal allowed size of a hairpin is @xmath91 , this enforces a potentially strong _ penalty _ for the formation of a hairpin , since with every hairpin @xmath91 bases are denied the possibility of gaining energy by base pairing .",
    "this tends to make branchings less favorable and thus leads to longer stems .",
    "however , this additional constraint translates in the mountain representation into the rule that an upwards step may not be followed by a downwards step within the next @xmath91 steps .",
    "this is clearly a _ local _ modification of the random walk .",
    "thus , it does not change universal quantities although the above mentioned suppression of branchings will require much longer sequences in order to observe the asymptotic universal behavior . for real rna parameters ,",
    "the crossover length is very long due to this effect .",
    "for example , it is several hundred nucleotides for the cag repeat , and even longer for some other repeats .",
    "another characteristic exponent describes the scaling of the ladder size @xmath92 with the sequence length @xmath7 . as already mentioned in its definition ( [ eq_hdef ] ) , @xmath92 is equivalent to the average `` height '' of the mid - point of the sequence in the mountain picture . in the molten phase ,",
    "the random walk analogy immediately yields the result @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes ensemble average in the molten phase .    as should be clear from the coarse - grained view depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_hdef ] , the ensemble of rna secondary structures in the molten phase can be mapped directly to the ensemble of _ branched polymers_. these branched polymers are _ rooted _ at the bases @xmath95 and @xmath96 of the rna . in this context , @xmath82 is known as the configuration exponent of the rooted branched polymer  @xcite . additionally from the result ( [ eq_hscaling ] ) , we see that the ladder length of the branched polymer scales , a well - known result for the branched polymer in the absence of self - avoidance  @xcite . ] as @xmath97 . because of the very visual analogy of the secondary structures to branched polymer , we refer to the configurational entropy of the secondary structures as the `` branching entropy '' .    finally , the binding probabilities @xmath50 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq_returnprobability ] ) only depend on the distance @xmath98 in the molten phase , i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "the behavior of this function can be derived explicitly by inserting the result eq .",
    "( [ eq_moltenz ] ) for the partition function into eq .",
    "( [ eq_returnprobability ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one just needs to recognize that @xmath100 corresponds in the random walk analogy to the first - return probability of a random walk after @xmath101-steps . in either case ,",
    "one finds the result @xmath102 i.e. , the return probability decays with the separation @xmath101 of the two bases as a power law with the configuration exponent @xmath82 . for the pinching free energy @xmath103",
    ", we simply set @xmath104 and obtain @xmath105 for large @xmath7 , i.e. , it scales _ logarithmically _ in the molten phase .",
    "this logarithmic dependence merely reflects the loss in branching entropy due to the pinching constraint and is a manifestation of the configuration exponent @xmath82 .",
