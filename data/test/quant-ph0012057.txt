    "a quantum computer processes quantum information that is stored in quantum bits ( qubits ) @xcite .",
    "if a small set of fundamental operations , or  universal quantum logic gates \" can be performed on the qubits , then a quantum computer can be programmed to solve an arbitrary problem @xcite .",
    "essentially , the quantum computation can be viewed as a coherent superposition of digital computation proceeding in parallel .",
    "the explosion of interest in quantum computation can be traced to shor s demonstration that a quantum computer could efficiently factorize large integers @xcite .",
    "cirac and zoller @xcite have made one of the most promising proposal for the implementation of a quantum computer . a number of identical atoms are stored and laser cooled in a linear radio - frequency quadrupole trap to form a quantum register .",
    "the radio - frequency trap potential gives strong confinement of the ions in the directions transverse to the trap axis , while an electrostatic potential forces the ions to oscillate in an effective harmonic potential in the axial direction .",
    "after laser cooling the ions become localized along the trap axis with a spacing determined by their coulomb repulsion and the confining axial potential.the normal mode of the ions collective oscillations which has the lowest frequency , is the axial center of mass ( cm ) mode , in which all the trapped ions oscillate together .",
    "a qubit is the electronic ground state @xmath0 and a long - lived excited state @xmath1 of the trapped ions .",
    "the electronic configuration of individual ions , and the quantum state of their collective cm vibrations can be manipulated by coherent interactions of the ion with a laser beam , in a standing wave configuration , which can be pointed at any of the ions .",
    "the cm mode of the axial vibrations may then be used as a  bus \" to implement the quantum logical gates .",
    "once the quantum computation has been completed , the readout is performed through the mechanism of quantum jumps .",
    "several features of this scheme have been demonstrated experimentally , mostly using a single trapped ion @xcite .",
    "the implementation of a large - scale quantum computer is recognized to be a technological challenge of unprecedent proportions .",
    "in fact the qubits must be easily manipulated , but must be also well isolated from decohering influence which places considerable limitations on the capabilities of such devices @xcite .",
    "practically , there are two fundamentally different types of decoherence during a computation : the dissipative one , due to the spontaneous decay of the metastable states @xmath1 , and the non - dissipative one due to random phase fluctuations of various nature .",
    "while the first has been considered carefully @xcite , by also developing strategies to reduce spontaneous decay , like watchdog stabilization @xcite , the second does not received much attention ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , non - dissipative decoherence seems actually dominant in trapped ion based experiments @xcite , whose results have been recently well explained @xcite , both qualitatively and quantitatively , by simply considering the time as a statistical variable and then averaging over a properly defined probability distribution @xcite .",
    "the developed approach results model - independent , hence quite ductile .",
    "then , our aim here , is to study the performances of an ion - trap quantum information processor by using this approach .",
    "practically , the latter allows us to account for the fluctuations of the raman laser intensity @xcite . instead , in @xcite",
    "a specific model is used , i.e. a random phase drift is added by hand at the end of each qubit rotation while in our case the stochasticity is already included in the time evolution . moreover ,",
    "our analysis is based on exact parameters values fitting experimental data @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we shall review a general model for non - dissipative decoherence . in section iii",
    "we shall apply this theory to fundamental logic operations . in section",
    "iv we evaluate the limits of a quantum computer due to this type of decoherence . finally , section v is for concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we review the formalism describing non - dissipative decoherence derived in refs .",
    "it is based on the idea that time is a random variable or , alternatively , that the system hamiltonian ( therefore its eigenvalues ) fluctuates .",
    "this leads to random phases in the energy eigenstates representation .",
    "then , the resulting evolution of the system must be averaged on a suitable probability distribution , and this leads to the decay of the off - diagonal elements of the density operator .",
    "let us consider an initial state @xmath2 and consider the case of a random evolution time .",
    "then , the evolved state will be averaged over a probability distribution @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the usual solution of the liouville - von neumann equation with @xmath6/\\hbar$ ] .",
    "one can write as well @xmath7 where @xmath8 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the function @xmath3 has been determined to satisfy the following conditions : i ) @xmath9 must be a density operator , i.e. it must be self - adjoint , positive - definite , and with unit - trace .",
    "this leads to the condition that @xmath3 must be non - negative and normalized , i.e. a probability density in @xmath10 , so that eq.([rhobardef ] ) is a completely positive map ; ii ) @xmath11 satisfies the semigroup property @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "these requirements are satisfied by @xmath14 and @xmath15 where the parameter @xmath16 naturally appears as a scaling time .",
    "the expression ( [ p ] ) is the so - called @xmath17-distribution function , well known in line theory .",
    "its interpretation is particularly simple when @xmath18 with @xmath19 integer ; in that case @xmath20 gives the probability density that the waiting time for @xmath19 independent events is @xmath10 and @xmath16 is the mean time interval between two events .",
    "generally , the meaning of the parameter @xmath16 can be understood by considering the mean of the evolution time @xmath21 , and its variance @xmath22 .    when @xmath23 , @xmath24 so that @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the usual unitary evolution",
    ". however , for finite @xmath16 , the evolution operator @xmath11 describes a decay of the off diagonal matrix elements in the energy representation , whereas the diagonal matrix elements remain constants , i.e. the energy is still a constant of motion .",
    "in fact , in the energy eigenbasis , eqs.([rhobarv ] ) and ( [ v ] ) yield @xmath27 where @xmath28 with @xmath29 the energy difference .",
    "one can recognize in eq.([rhobarnm ] ) , beside the exponential decay , a frequency shift of every oscillating term .",
    "the phase diffusion aspect of the present approach can also be seen in the evolution equation for the averaged density matrix @xmath9 . indeed , by differentiating with respect to time eq.([rhobarv ] ) and using ( [ v ] ) one gets the following master equation for @xmath9 @xmath30 it is worth noting that by expanding the logarithm up to second order in @xmath16 , one obtains @xmath31 -\\frac{\\tau}{2\\hbar^2}\\left[h,\\left[h,{\\overline\\rho}(t ) \\right]\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] which is the well known phase - destroying master equation @xcite .",
    "hence , eq.([meq ] ) appears as a generalized phase destroying master equation taking into account higher order terms in @xmath16 . nonetheless , the present approach is different from the usual master equation approach , in the sense that it is model independent , non perturbative and without specific statistical assumptions .",
    "the theory well describes also hamiltonian fluctuations .",
    "let us consider , for instance , a hamiltonian @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a fluctuating parameter with mean value @xmath34 .",
    "whenever @xmath35 induces oscillations , we can accounts for the fluctuations of the frequency @xmath33 by writing @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37/\\hbar$ ] , and @xmath38 is a positive dimensionless random variable .",
    "furthermore , @xmath39 the first two moments of @xmath40 determine the properties of the fluctuating frequency @xmath33 , @xmath41 that is , the frequency @xmath33 is a white , non - gaussian ( due to the non - gaussian form of @xmath40 ) stochastic process . in fact , the semigroup assumption made , implies a markovian treatment in which the spectrum of the fluctuations is flat in the relevant frequency range .",
    "this in particular implies that we are neglecting the dynamics at small times , of the order of the correlation time of the fluctuations .",
    "the non - gaussian character of @xmath40 can be traced back to the fact that @xmath40 must be definite and normalized in the interval @xmath42 and not in @xmath43 .",
    "this is another fundamental difference with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , where a gaussian character for the random phase drift errors is assumed , while we make no a priori statistical assumptions .",
    "indeed , the properties of the probability distribution @xmath44 are derived only from the semigroup condition , and it is interesting to note that this condition yields a gaussian probability distribution as a limiting case . in fact , from eq.([p ] ) one can see that @xmath3 tends to become a gaussian in the large time limit @xmath45 .    in the case of rabi oscillations , @xmath46 becomes proportional to the pulse area , while @xmath16 gives an estimate of the pulse area fluctuations , since it corresponds to a fractional error of the pulse area @xmath47 .",
    "quantum computation ideally corresponds to a physical process @xmath48 where a given input state is mapped to an output state by a unitary transformation @xmath49 .",
    "it has been shown that any quantum computation can be decomposed into one - bit gates and a universal two - bit gate which involves entanglement operation on two qubits @xcite .    in order to characterize a physical process in a quantum system",
    ", we follow ref . @xcite .",
    "the aim is to characterize the process given as a  black box \" , by a sequence of measurements in such a way that it is possible to predict what the output state will be for any input state .",
    "we assume that the system is initially prepared in a pure state @xmath50 where @xmath51 are orthogonal states spanning the hilbert space of allowed input states with dimension @xmath52 .",
    "then , in the ideal case , the output state can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 are system operators not depending on the input state .    whenever the unitary transformation is given by the time evolution operator @xmath55 , the initial state @xmath2 represents the input state while the evolved state @xmath56 represents the output one . since in section ii @xmath56 is replaced by @xmath9 , here we have to replace @xmath57 by @xmath58    now , in order to see to what extent the real physical process approaches the ideal one , we use as parameter the fidelity @xmath59 where the subscript ",
    "@xmath60 \" indicates the average overall possible input states .",
    "obviously a gate fidelity close to one indicates that the gate was carried out almost ideally .",
    "in what follows we will see that the fidelity @xmath61 ( [ fdef ] ) can be expressed in terms of the tensor @xmath62      in the case of one bit @xmath63 , and the vector basis is given by @xmath64\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the rabi frequency and @xmath65 the laser phase .",
    "eq.([hone ] ) leads to the following evolution @xmath66|g\\rangle -ie^{i\\phi}\\sin\\left[\\omega t/2\\right ]    \\\\",
    "u(t)|e\\rangle&=&\\cos\\left[\\omega t/2 \\right]|e\\rangle -ie^{-i\\phi}\\sin\\left[\\omega t/2\\right ]    a single qubit rotation .",
    "it is clear from the above evolution equations that fluctuations in the rabi frequency can be accounted by simply replacing @xmath67 with @xmath68 ( where now @xmath34 indicates the mean rabi frequency ) accordingly to the arguments of section ii .",
    "then , similarly to eq.([rbar ] ) , it is possible to evaluate @xmath69 and the tensor elements ( [ ftens ] ) ( see appendix i ) . in terms of these elements",
    "the fidelity results @xmath70 in this case the fidelity depends on time which practically determines the amount of rotation , however , in the next section we shall consider a @xmath71 rotation , i.e. @xmath72 .      in the case of two - bit @xmath73 , and the vector basis is given by @xmath74 is employed .    in this case",
    "the laser frequency is chosen tuned to the first motional sideband and the equilibrium position of the ion coincides with the node of the laser standing wave .",
    "the hamiltonian describing such interaction is @xcite @xmath75\\ , , \\quad q=0\\ , , \\\\ \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\omega'}{2 } \\left [ |e ' \\rangle_n\\langle g| a e^{-i\\phi } + |g \\rangle_n\\langle e'| a^{\\dag } e^{i\\phi}\\right]\\ , , \\quad q=1\\ , , \\end{array } \\right .",

    "the index @xmath79 refers to the transitions excited by the laser , @xmath80 or @xmath81 , which depend on the laser polarization .",
    "instead the index @xmath82 refers to the @xmath82-th ion on the trap ( 1 , 2 in our case ) . moreover , the factor @xmath83 , where @xmath84 indicates the number of trapped ions , appears as a consequence of the mssbauer effect @xcite .",
    "the universal two - bit gate , defined by @xcite @xmath85 can be realized in three steps by means of eq.([htwo ] ) :    *   a @xmath71 laser pulse with polarization @xmath86 and @xmath87 excites e.g. the first ion",
    ". the evolution will be @xmath88\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath89 .",
    "*   the laser directed on the second ion is then turned on for a time of a @xmath90 pulse with polarization @xmath91 and @xmath87 .",
    "the evolution will be @xmath92\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath93 .",
    "*   a @xmath71 laser pulse with polarization @xmath86 and @xmath87 excites again the first ion .",
    "the evolution will be @xmath94\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath95 .    also in this case to account for the fluctuations in the rabi frequency",
    ", we can introduce a stochastic variable @xmath96 ( where now @xmath97 is related to the mean rabi frequency @xmath34 as in ( [ htwo ] ) ) .",
    "then , we have @xmath98 which are used to calculate the tensor elements ( [ ftens ] ) ( see appendix ii ) .",
    "finally , the fidelity results @xmath99 in this case @xmath61 does not depend on time since the gate operation is realized with the above definite steps .",
    "if one accounts the recent breakthroughs in the real of fault tolerant quantum computation @xcite , an arbitrarily large quantum computations can be performed accurately provided to have an high degree of accuracy on the single gate operation .",
    "this sets an obvious figure of merit for quantum computation technology , namely , the expected probability of error in one quantum gate , which should be of the order of @xmath100 @xcite .    in fig.1",
    "we show the deviation from the perfect gate fidelity as a function of the fractional error of the pulse area .",
    "in particular the lower straight line concerns the one - bit gate for a @xmath71 rotation ( [ fone ] ) , and the upper straight line the universal two - bit gate ( [ ftwo ] ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that the value of @xmath101 @xmath102 gives the best fit for the experimental data of ref.@xcite , i.e. @xmath103 @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "it means to have @xmath106 whose corresponding value of accuracy , i.e. @xmath107 , is quite far from the desired one , i.e. @xmath100 . in the case of universal two - bit gate",
    ", we have a better value of accuracy ( upper straight line ) already for @xmath108 slightly less than @xmath109 .",
    "it turns out that the main limitations rely on the single bit rotation instead on universal two - bit gate .",
    "this fact , though counterintuitive , can be easily understood if one consider the expression ( [ stata ] ) for the two cases .",
    "it results @xmath110 for @xmath71-pulses .",
    "this means that the coupling of the qubits with the vibrational degree of freedom makes the two - bit gate less affected by the noise with respect to the one - bit gate . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter is built up with on resonance pulse , hence it is more sensitive to noisy effects , differently from the two - bit gate where off resonant pulses are used .",
    "however , since actually @xmath111 , also in the two - bit gate the accuracy falls very far from the desirable value .    based on these results , we can state that quantum information processing on a large scale is unrealistic . as a matter of fact",
    ", the fault tolerant quantum computation requires a value @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 @xmath102 for @xmath103 @xmath104 . since the finite value of @xmath16 is related to the rabi frequency fluctuations ( or in turn to laser intensity fluctuations ) @xcite , this means to improve the laser stability by a factor @xmath114 at least !    it is also to remark that , within the presented non - dissipative decoherence theory , the linear behavior of the gate fidelity ( fig.1 ) is typical of the limit @xmath115 .    a rough estimation of the capabilities of a quantum computer in the presence of non - dissipative decoherence can be also made with the following arguments .",
    "let us consider the optimistic case of a single run of the shor s algorithm , and the use of the universal two - bit gate operations .",
    "then , the non - dissipative decoherence theory @xcite shows that in the limit of @xmath116 the decay rate can be written as @xmath117 ( see e.g. eq.([ga ] ) ) .",
    "let us now suppose to factorize a @xmath118-bit number .",
    "then , the number of trapped ions @xmath84 should be at least @xmath119 @xcite . the time needed for a single run of the shor s algorithm",
    "is given by the time required for an elementary logical operation @xmath120 multiplied by the required number of elementary operations , approximately @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "of course this product should be much less then the docoherence time @xmath122 . nevertheless , by using the actual experimental values for parameters ( and the corresponding value of @xmath101 )",
    ", it results clear that the factorization of even a four - bit number results impossible .",
    "in conclusion we have studied the limitations imposed by non - dissipative decoherence on quantum computation .",
    "practically , we have seen that non - dissipative decoherence actually constitute a serious impediment to realize quantum computer beside dissipative decoherence .",
    "we have used a model able to accurately describe the decoherence phenomena on ion trap based experiments caused by the fluctuations of classical quantities .",
    "we have shown that large scale computation seems impossible with the present proposals .",
    "our results indicate that even a computationally modest goal will be extremely challenging experimentally @xcite .",
    "although the conclusions of this paper are rather pessimistic with regard to the practical application of quantum computers for actual computation , there are applications requiring much fewer operations which are worth considering @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank d. vitali for helpful comments .",
