    "the idea of statistical hadronization of charm quarks in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite has led to a series of investigations of @xmath0 production based on this approach @xcite .",
    "initial interest focussed on the available sps data for @xmath0 production in pb - pb collisions , but the trends for rhic and lhc were also investigated . an independent approach , based on a kinetic model @xcite has been developed in parallel .",
    "recently the statistical hadronization model was extended to the production of @xmath1 mesons @xcite and multiply heavy - flavored hadrons @xcite .",
    "we have shown earlier @xcite that the @xmath0 data at sps energy can be described within the statistical approach , but only when assuming that the charm production cross section is enhanced by about a factor of 3 beyond the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions .",
    "for rhic energy , the predictions of our model were shown @xcite to be in good agreement with the early phenix @xmath0 data @xcite as well as with the relative yields of open charm mesons measured by star @xcite .",
    "we focus in this paper on the production of charmonia in nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic ( au - au , @xmath2=200 gev ) and lhc ( pb - pb , @xmath2=5.5 tev ) energies within the framework of the statistical hadronization model , shm @xcite .",
    "particular emphasis is placed on the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of @xmath0 and , for lhc energy , also @xmath1 production .",
    "section 2 contains a brief summary of the main ingredients of the model along with a description of recent updates concerning the chemical freeze - out parameters , the spectrum of open charm mesons and baryons , and the values of charm production cross section .",
    "furthermore , for a more realistic description of the centrality dependence in nucleus - nucleus collisions , we separate the collision geometry into a core and a corona part .    in section 3 , we provide an estimate of the magnitude of @xmath3 annihilation in the expanding quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "in section 4 , we use the model to predict phase space distributions of quarkonia produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "we compare the results with sps data and with data available at rhic @xcite and provide predictions for the lhc energy , where data @xcite are expected in about two years . in particular the situation at sps energy is significantly modified when taking into account the realistic reaction geometry .",
    "we extend the model for the calculation of @xmath1 yields in pb+pb collisions at lhc energy . in this case , despite the similarity in production rates of bottom at lhc with charm at rhic @xcite , the applicability of our model may be questionable , as the thermalization of the bottom quarks may be debatable .",
    "we discuss below the main sources of uncertainty in these calculations .",
    "the statistical hadronization model ( shm ) @xcite assumes that all heavy quarks ( charm and bottom ) are produced in primary hard collisions and that their total number stays constant until hadronization .",
    "the validity of this latter point is investigated in the next section .",
    "another important factor is thermal ( but not chemical ) equilibration in the qgp , at least near the critical temperature , @xmath4 .",
    "the quarkonia are then all produced ( non - perturbatively ) when @xmath4 is reached and the system hadronizes .",
    "our picture is different from the one of color screening @xcite ( see @xcite for a more recent account ) , which assumes that formation of quarkonia takes place before a thermalized qgp is established but is suppressed in the qgp when the temperature reaches a certain threshold , which is species dependent .",
    "recent results from solving quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) on the lattice indicate indeed that @xmath0 mesons could survive in the qgp up to 1.6@xmath4 @xcite , implying , e.g. little melting at sps energies .",
    "further investigations indicate that @xmath1 mesons may survive up to temperatures of at least 2.3@xmath4 @xcite .    in the shm",
    ", we assume that ( i ) no quarkonia production takes place before the formation time @xmath5 of the qgp or ( ii ) that all quarkonia formed before @xmath5 are melted in the initial hot qgp phase . under this scenario the possible existence of bound quarkonia states in the qgp is not important , since the estimates made in the next section demonstrate that , unless there is a resonance - like enhancement of the cross section , formation of quarkonia from uncorrelated @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks in the expanding plasma is very unlikely even if such states exist as bound states .",
    "thermal equilibration of charm quarks in a qgp1 gev ) temperatures , as is demonstrated in @xcite . ]",
    "is currently investigated vigorously both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "in particular , elliptic flow of charm quarks @xcite has been demonstrated within a coalescence approach @xcite to be a very sensitive probe of thermalization .",
    "large elliptic flow is obtained in hydrodynamic simulations based on the diffusion coefficient of charm quarks in a qgp @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow of @xmath0 is smaller in recent hydrodynamic calculations @xcite than in coalescence models @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the experimental results on the elliptic flow of electrons from charm mesons ( `` non - photonic '' electrons ) @xcite do indicate that charm quarks indeed thermalize to a significant degree .",
    "in addition , a large energy loss of charm quarks in the qgp @xcite has been recently found by experiments @xcite .",
    "the experimental results of phenix @xcite indicate in fact a larger energy loss than theoretically expected @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for charm thermalization is not well understood .",
    "a model based on resonant rescattering of heavy quarks in the qgp @xcite reproduces quite well the experimental results .",
    "it is worth noticing that in this model the thermalization time for heavy quarks is substantially reduced compared to the case of perturbative interactions @xcite . in transport models",
    "the measured elliptic flow can be reproduced only for a charm quark scattering cross section that is much larger than the cross sections computed within perturbative qcd @xcite . in any case",
    ", we note that the shm can be applied even if charm thermalization is reached only close to @xmath4 .    in the following we briefly outline the calculation steps in our model @xcite .",
    "the heavy quark ( charm or bottom ) balance equation @xcite , which has to include canonical suppression factors whenever the number of charm or bottom pairs is not much larger than 1 , is used to determine a fugacity factor @xmath8 via : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the number of directly produced @xmath3 pairs and @xmath11 are modified bessel functions . in the fireball of volume @xmath12 the total number of open ( @xmath13 ) and hidden ( @xmath14 ) charm hadrons is computed from their grand - canonical densities @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the densities of different particle species in the grand canonical ensemble are calculated following the statistical model @xcite . the balance equation ( [ aa : eq1 ] )",
    "defines the fugacity parameter @xmath8 that accounts for deviations of heavy quark multiplicity from the value that is expected in complete chemical equilibrium . since in the shm",
    "the charm and bottom quark yields are completey determined by their production in initial ( hard ) collisions the fugacity factor can be very large , especially for bottom production .",
    "the yield of charmonia of type @xmath17 is obtained as : @xmath18 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ aa_fig7x ] we present predictions for the transverse momentum spectrum of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in central collisions at lhc .",
    "we show the spectra for a range of expansion velocities , as expected for lhc energy . for pp collisions in the corona we have assumed the same spectral shape at lhc as measured in p@xmath19 collisions at tevatron @xcite , which are also included for comparison in fig .",
    "[ aa_fig7x ] .",
    "the corona fractions corresponding to central pb+pb collisions ( @xmath20=350 ) are 0.13 for @xmath0 and 0.09 for @xmath1 . for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the spectral shapes expected within the statistical hadronization model are very different compared those expected from the superposition of pp collisions , making the data at lhc a stringent test of our model .",
    "we have presented new results on the statistical hadronization of heavy quarks at the sps , rhic and lhc energies .",
    "we have focused on the results for @xmath0 yields , but have also extended the model to predict @xmath1 yields in pb+pb collisions at the lhc energy . included in our model is now a separation of the collision geometry into a core ( qgp ) and a corona ( pp collisions ) part .",
    "our estimate of the annihilation rates of charm quark in a hot plasma demonstrates that this is a small effect .",
    "an important ingredient in our model is the charm production cross section , which is presently quite poorly measured .",
    "we have considered the effect of its uncertainty on the model predictions . for sps energy , our present calculations",
    "are performed assuming that the hadronization takes place within one unit of rapidity at midrapidity , as used also for rhic and lhc energies .",
    "good agreement with data is found with a charm cross section which is moderately ( a factor of 2 ) larger , but consistent within errors with pqcd calculations . for rhic energy",
    "we have studied the centrality and rapidity dependence of @xmath0 production .",
    "our model is in good agreement with the available data , lending strong support for the picture of statistical hadronization .",
    "we have discussed the transverse momentum distributions of @xmath0 mesons expected from the model .",
    "the present data , in particular those at rhic energy , are compatible with the picture of the @xmath0 ( kinematic ) freeze - out coincident with chemical freeze - out , but more precise data are needed to quantitatively explore this idea .",
    "our predictions for lhc energy concerning centrality , rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the @xmath0 yield will be tested with data within the next few years .",
    "we are indebted to m. cacciari for providing us the rapidity distribution of the charm production cross section at the rhic energy and for valuable discussions .",
