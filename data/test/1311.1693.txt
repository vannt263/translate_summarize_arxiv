    "non - stellar sources , such as low - luminosity agn , likely also play a role in many galaxies @xcite , at least in their central regions .",

    "the [ o iii ] 5007  specific line luminosity drops off dramatically at the highest sd temperatures ; this is because with harder spectra , oxygen is increasingly ionized to @xmath73 near the illuminated face of the gas , reducing the emitting volume for [ o iii ] . at the same time",
    ", high - energy photons penetrate deeper into the nebula , preferentially ionizing neutral oxygen .",
    "note , however , that this itself may pose a problem for any high - temperature sd channel , as the ism in post - starburst ellipticals are observed to have relatively high values of the [ o iii ] 5007 / h@xmath7 ratio @xcite .",
    "the [ o ii ] 3727  cooling line , originating in the more low - ionized regions of nebulae ( the interior , in the geometry discussed here ) , is expected to have an ew @xmath11 15  ( for @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath13 @xmath3 @xmath4 ) .",

    "the [ o ii ] 3727  line ( as well as h@xmath20 ) has been invoked as a proxy for the star - formation rate ( more on this in the following section ) , and already the volumetric [ o ii ] 3727  luminosity function has been mapped at least to z @xmath18 5.4 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "individual nearby galaxies which have undergone recent , possibly quenched starbursts would make ideal targets for follow - up studies . as an example , ngc 3156 is a nearby ( @xmath9 22mpc ) early - type galaxy which the sauron survey found to host a post - starburst subpopulation ( with an estimated mass of @xmath9 @xmath6 ) .",
    "the proposed cubes nuv spectrograph would be able to detect the [ o ii ] 3727  line ( given our standard sd case from above , and assuming @xmath40 = 0.5 ) with a s / n @xmath9 10 @xmath76 in just 1800 seconds .    although its specific luminosity is greatly enhanced with the presence of a high temperature source population ( see fig .",

    "the galex fuv spectrograph ( now no longer operational ) would have required a prohibitive @xmath0 51 ksec in order to reach s / n @xmath0 5 , with 1335  lying outside the optimal response of the instrument . however",

    "this would produce an offset in the calibration of any such sfr indicator , which would be dependent on age and mass of the stellar population . for example",
    ", for @xmath8 @xmath18 @xmath13 @xmath18 @xmath4 sd progenitor population , a 3 gyr - old @xmath82 ssp would still appear to have an ongoing star - formation rate of @xmath83 @xmath10 4@xmath12/yr from the [ o ii ] 3727  indicator .",

    "because of their insensitivity to interstellar reddening , ir lines and the ir continuum itself are extremely useful sfr indicators . as an important coolant in the neutral ism , the [ c ii ]",

    "if there is indeed a significant contribution from populations of accreting , nuclear - burning wds , this should also provide an age - dependent offset .",
    "for example , for our standard case sd scenario , a 3 gyr - old @xmath82 ssp would still appear to have an ongoing star - formation rate of @xmath84 @xmath10 1@xmath12/yr .",
    "the [ o i ] 63@xmath85 m and 146@xmath85 m ir lines would provide only a small contribution to any sfr - indicator based on the continuum flux .",
    "however , as individual lines , both may in principle be a useful measure of the population of accreting wds in galaxies , in particular the 63@xmath85 m line , which is @xmath0 5 times stronger than the [ c ii ] 157@xmath85 m line for sd progenitor effective temperatures of @xmath8 @xmath18 @xmath13 @xmath18 @xmath4 . with the end of the herschel space observatory s operational lifespan , there is at present no instrument which could provide new observations in this waveband , however ample archival data is available .",
    "the field - imaging far - infrared line spectrometer ( fifi - ls ) , will also soon be available , observing in the 42 - 210 micron band .    as a final word of caution , we recall that our results for the ir and fir forbidden lines discussed above are sensitive to the assumed density of the gas , which is observed to vary radially ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , any quantitative assessment of the contribution of a possible sd channel to the emission of these lines should consider carefully the environment under study .",
    "furthermore , these lines do not originate solely from photoionized regions , but arise also in the neutral medium @xcite .",
    "so far , we have considered only single - age stellar populations , and assumed the same metallicity throughout .",
    "although we have previously demonstrated that varying the metallicity of the stellar population will not significantly alter the ionizing continuum expected from sd progenitors @xcite , we have not tested the effect of varying star - formation histories . in a real galaxy , a much more complex superposition of populations of differing ages",
    "should be expected .",
    "this is particularly concerning , should the presence of a significantly older subpopulation be able to strongly dilute the observed ew in a galaxy with an otherwise young mean stellar age .",
    "this could in turn significantly reduce the detectability of our diagnostic lines .    in order to evaluate this possibility , we perform the following experiment . we mix spectra of varying fractions of 1 gyr - old , z = 2.5@xmath87 and 10 gyr - old , z = @xmath87 stellar populations from @xcite . using the method of @xcite based on the lick indices @xcite",
    ", we find the luminosity - weighted age depending on the relative fractions of young and old populations ( johansson , private communication , see also johansson et al in prep ) . at the same time , we compute the expected flux in any of emission lines discussed above for the composite stellar population , using the combined spectra in our photoionization calculations . here",
    "we assume the same gas density @xmath88 with a gas phase metallicity of z = @xmath50 , as above , and with ionization parameter log(u ) = -3.5 .",

    "note that the two tracks do not agree at 10 gyrs because of the different assumptions for the metallicity of the stellar population .",
    "as can be clearly seen , the ew is not significantly affected in the case of composite stellar populations .",
    "we have demonstrated how observations of forbidden lines of the most abundant metals , as well as recombination lines of hydrogen and ionized helium , can be used to constrain any population of sources with effective temperatures @xmath13 @xmath11 @xmath2 in early - type galaxies .",

    "should already be able to either detect evidence of the sd channel or constrain its contribution to the sn ia rate down to a few per cent of the observed total for inferred delay - times 1 gyr @xmath3 t @xmath3 4 gyr .",
    "future observations with the planned wso ( the world space observatory * ? ? ?",
    "* ) should also be capable of making similar progress with observations of the [ c ii ] 1335  ( and he ii 1640 ) lines .",
    "the possible contribution of the sd channel at the earliest delay - times ( @xmath93 gyr ) can also be remarkably well - constrained with measurements of the specific ( per unit stellar mass ) luminosities of the `` classical '' strong emission lines , such as h@xmath94 , [ o ii ] 3727  , [ n ii ] 6583 .",
    "for a 500 myr - old stellar population , the h@xmath20 recombination line luminosity is predicted to be enhanced over the ssp - only case by up to @xmath0 two orders of magnitude for sd progenitor temperatures t @xmath3 2@xmath62 .",
    "a similar enhancement is expected for the [ o ii ] 3727  line luminosity for sd temperatures spanning the @xmath95 k range , suggesting calorimetry of post - starburst galaxies may be able to constrain the sd contribution to less than @xmath0 1% .",
    "alternatively , observations of emission - line nebulae consistent with ionization by the old ssp alone may be interpreted as a constraint on the total mass accreted in the steady nuclear - burning regime . assuming a hypothetical sd scenrio accounted for all sne ia",

    "if the sd scenario did indeed account for a significant fraction of the sn ia rate , than one might expect the resulting enhancement in the luminosities of emission - lines h@xmath20 , [ o ii ] 3727 , and [ c ii ] 157@xmath85 m to introduce an age - dependent offset in their calibration as indicators of the sfr in galaxies . at the same time",
