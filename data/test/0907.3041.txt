    "the interplay of mechanical motion and electronic properties has been studied widely in molecular physics and , recently , in molecular electronics and nanomechanical structures .",
    "present - day experimental methods enable the fabrication of nanostructures such as single - molecule junctions or quantum dots where a small number of electrons couple to one or more vibrational modes .",
    "electronic transport in these systems exhibits vibrational sidebands at high bias voltages,@xcite the shuttle instability,@xcite and the franck - condon suppression of the low - bias electric conductance.@xcite the shuttle phenomenon arises from modifications in the spatial conformation driven by the charging events , whereas the franck - condon effects emerge from the transition rates between discrete vibronic states .",
    "an additional important consequence of vibrational degrees of freedom is the polaron shift which renormalizes the coulomb repulsion of confined electrons and modifies the coulomb blockade physics of the system . at sufficiently strong couplings the sign of the effective charging",
    "energy @xmath0 can become negative implying an effectively attractive interaction between electrons.@xcite the regime of a negative effective charging energy is known to be realized in certain molecules ( an effect known in chemistry as potential inversion).@xcite it may also be accessible in vibrating quantum dots when the electron - vibron coupling is sufficiently strong .",
    "it has been shown recently that the negative @xmath0 regime opens the possibility for novel features such as an efficient electron pair tunneling through single molecules @xcite and a charge - kondo effect.@xcite an underlying assumption of these works is that the negative charging energy does not induce an instability of the system .",
    "this is indeed the case when the energy gain due to the effectively attractive charging energy is smaller than the cost in single - particle energy due to the finite level spacing , when adding ( removing ) electrons to ( from ) the dot .",
    "this paper is devoted to study the opposite regime where the magnitude of the negative ( renormalized ) charging energy exceeds the single - particle level spacing .",
    "the studied system is modeled as a single - electron transistor ( set ) whose center island is coupled to a mechanical vibration.@xcite it is shown that the system becomes unstable towards addition or extraction of electrons .",
    "assuming that the vibron hamiltonian contains an anharmonic contribution we show that the instability is regularized and that the system possesses a well defined ground state . the effective charging energy as a function of the electron number in the dot has a double - well structure which , moreover , depends on temperature .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the usual parabolic charging energy and leads to a variety of novel effects . at zero gate charge and low temperatures",
    ", there is a symmetry between particle and hole - like excitations causing the existence of degenerate minima of the effective charging energy which for weak anharmonicity are separated by a large number of electrons . the average population and the electron number fluctuations are highly sensitive to the gate voltage which breaks the symmetry between the minima .",
    "we also show that the transport properties of the system exhibit a number of distinctive features attributed to the unusual form of the effective charging energy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the model , demonstrate the origin of the negative-@xmath0 instability , and state the precise conditions under which it takes place . in sec .",

    "and @xmath1 model high resistance tunnel junctions which allow the island to exchange electrons with the reservoirs , @xmath2 represents a gate capacitance .",
    "the central part is coupled to a vibrational mode . ]",
    "we are considering a quantum dot or a single - molecule junction coupled to a single vibrational degree of freedom .",
    "the dot is modeled as a set where the number of electrons on the island couples to a vibron mode , see fig .",
    "[ abb_1 ] .",
    "the system could be realized , for example , by a suspended center element between large metallic leads enabling tunneling between the dot and the leads .",
    "the electronic part of the hamiltonian for a set is @xmath3 where the first term represents the single - particle energies of the leads and the center part , the second term describes tunneling between the leads and the center , and the last term is the relevant charging energy of the system .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian and the charging energy take the standard forms @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively . here , @xmath6 is the number of extra electrons on the island , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the total induced gate charge .",
    "the number @xmath9 corresponds to the positively charged lattice ions on the central island .",
    "the full hamiltonian of the system @xmath10 also includes the vibrational contribution @xmath11 where we have included the electron - vibron coupling @xmath12 with @xmath13 into the phonon hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ pham ] ) also includes an anharmonic @xmath14 term whose strength is controlled by the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the anharmonic term becomes comparable to harmonic effects when the phonon displacement is of the order of @xmath16 times the oscillator length @xmath17 .",
    "the inclusion of this term , even in the weakly nonlinear case @xmath18 , is crucial for the stability of the system for large couplings @xmath19 . to demonstrate this",
    "let us first assume @xmath20 and examine the phonon - induced modification of the charging energy .",
    "since the electron number couples linearly to the phonon position , it is possible to introduce a shifted phonon coordinate by completing the square in the phonon hamiltonian . as a result one eliminates the coupling term and generates an extra term @xmath21 quadratic in @xmath22 which can be thought of as a modification of the charging energy @xmath23 it is important to recognize that the well - known polaron shift @xmath21 gives rise to a _ negative _ contribution .",
    "the overall prefactor of the @xmath24-term will be negative if @xmath25 meaning that the effective potential favors large absolute values of @xmath22 .",
    "defining the quantity @xmath26 , the negative charging energy condition ( [ neg ] ) takes the form @xmath27 consequently , in metallic quantum dots with a vanishingly small single - particle level separation , the energy can always be lowered by adding or removing an arbitrary number of particles when condition ( [ cond1 ] ) holds .",
    "thus the system does not possess a ground state and is unstable . in dots",
    "whose orbital energies due to confinement are not negligible compared to the charging and vibron energies , the single - particle energy cost should also be taken into account . to analyze this ,",
    "we introduce equidistant single - electron orbitals @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fermi velocity of the dot , @xmath30 is the effective size of the electronic confinement and @xmath31 is the level separation . expression ( [ singorb ] ) is appropriate in the vicinity of the fermi energy and holds exactly for a one - dimensional dirac spectrum .",
    "the energy cost of adding or removing @xmath22 electrons to or from the lowest available orbitals ( ignoring the spin degeneracy ) is @xmath32 adding the single - particle contribution to the effective potential ( [ epot ] ) we get @xmath33 where the second line follows by shifting the gate charge @xmath34 .",
    "the constant in eq .",
    "( [ epotmod1 ] ) is independent of @xmath22 and can be dropped .",
    "thus the functional form of the effective potential remains invariant , and the finite level separation just renormalizes charging energy and gate charge .",
    "the system is still fundamentally unstable provided that @xmath35 in the spin - degenerate case @xmath36 should be replaced by @xmath37 .",
    "alternatively , we can write this condition as @xmath38 , i.e. , we find an instability when the magnitude of the renormalized charging energy becomes larger than the level spacing .",
    "result ( [ cond2 ] ) shows that a constant ( or decreasing ) level spacing is not adequate to stabilize the system at sufficiently large couplings .",
    "the instability tends to change the electron number by increasing the displacement of the phonon mode .",
    "therefore it is natural to assume that at some point when the displacement becomes large the harmonic approximation for the vibron mode breaks down and anharmonic effects become significant .",
    "it turns out that a generalization of the above analysis to include a nonzero anharmonic term ( @xmath39 ) in eq .",
    "( [ pham ] ) always produces a well - defined ground state .",
    "the effective potential for electrons becomes temperature dependent and exhibits a variety of novel features .",
    "our discussion has a close relation to familiar stability conditions in fermi - liquid theory.@xcite in fact , it is well known that the fermi liquid remains stable even when the landau interaction parameter @xmath40 becomes negative as long as @xmath41 . since @xmath40 measures the interaction strength in units of the density of states , this is a precise analog of the stability condition ( [ cond2 ] ) expressed as @xmath42",

    "( [ effpot ] ) reduces to the ordinary charging energy , and in the absence of the anharmonic term @xmath51 it is temperature independent and coincides with expression ( [ epot ] ) . in the anharmonic case",
    "the polaron shift depends on the phonon state and thus the effective potential depends on the phonon temperature . in general ,",
    "an evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ effpot ] ) requires one to diagonalize ( [ pham ] ) numerically and to compute the phonon partition function .",
    "the behavior of the system is then determined by the relative strength of the energy scales @xmath44 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and the magnitude of dimensionless electron - phonon coupling @xmath19 .",
    "analytical expressions for the effective potential can be obtained for weakly unstable systems at zero temperature when considering the vibronic degree of freedom as classical .",
    "as this already illustrates some of the essential physics , we first consider this case before presenting more general numerical results for the fully quantum mechanical model .    starting with eq .",
    "( [ effpot ] ) , we can write the effective potential at zero temperature as @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the ground state energy of the phonon hamiltonian @xmath56 for excess charge @xmath22 . in the classical limit , the ground state energy is simply given by the minimum of the potential energy .",
    "noting that @xmath57 vanishes , we obtain @xmath58 for a weakly unstable system near zero gate charge , we expect that the effective potential has a minimum for small ( but nonzero ) @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we can neglect the quartic term when determining the position of the minimum in eq .",
    "( [ effpotmin ] ) , @xmath59 it is straightforward to include corrections to this expression and find that this approximation is valid as long as @xmath60 , i.e. , as long as the instability is only weakly developed . with this expression for @xmath61 , we find for the effective potential @xmath62 focusing on the case of zero gate charge , we can now compute the number of electrons @xmath9 which are entering the quantum dot as a consequence of the instability . minimizing the effective potential in eq .",
    "( [ effpotcl ] ) , we find @xmath63 note that there are indeed degenerate minima at @xmath64 for zero gate charge .",

    "expanding eq .",
    "( [ effpotcl ] ) around the minima , we find @xmath66 this sign reversal of the effective charging energy induced by the instability has important consequences . while a negative renormalized charging energy leads to pair tunneling in the absence of the instability,@xcite the positive effective charging energy @xmath65 implies that transport will be dominated again by single electron sequential tunneling processes once the instability develops .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the coulomb blockade is significantly weakened near the instability where many charge states have similar energies .",
    "we close this section with a remark on the validity of the classical approximation for the vibrons employed in this section . as can be readily seen from eq .",
    "( [ effpotzero ] ) , the quantum - mechanical zero - point energy of the vibron mode cancels out from this expression as long as the vibron remains harmonic , implying that the zero - point energy is independent of the electron number @xmath22 . thus , quantum corrections to our classical discussion are proportional to the anharmonicity and our classical expressions are an excellent approximation to the results of a fully quantum mechanical calculation as long as the anharmonicity remains small ( see sec .",

    "<S> in quantum dots or molecules with vibrational degrees of freedom the electron - vibron coupling renormalizes the electronic charging energy . for sufficiently strong coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the renormalized charging energy can become negative . here </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss an instability towards adding or removing an arbitrary number of electrons when the magnitude of the renormalized charging energy exceeds the single - particle level spacing . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the instability is regularized by the anharmonic contribution to the vibron energy . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting effective charging energy as a function of the electron number has a double - well structure causing a variety of novel features in the coulomb blockade properties . </S>"
