    "the gamma - ray burst of 28 february 1997 ( hereafter grb 970228 ) was a watershed event , especially at optical wavelengths .",
    "the afterglow phenomenon , long - lived multiwavelength emission , was discovered following grb 970228 in the x - rays ( costa  1997 ) and optical ( @xcite ) . despite intense observations , no radio transient of grb 970228",
    "was found ( @xcite ) ; the first radio afterglow ( frail  1997 ) had to await the next bepposax localization of grb 970508 .",
    "the basic predictions of the synchrotron shock model for grb afterglow appeared confirmed by grb 970228 ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .    despite intense efforts , early spectroscopy of the afterglow grb 970228 ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) failed to reveal the redshift .",
    "spectroscopy of the afterglow of grb 970508 proved more successful ( metzger  1997 ) , revealing that grb originated from a redshift @xmath1 . through the preponderance of redshift determinations and the association of grbs with faint galaxies ,",
    "it is now widely believed that the majority or all of long duration ( @xmath2 s ) gamma - ray bursts originate from cosmological distances .    even without a redshift ,",
    "observations of the afterglow of grb 970228 in relation to its immediate environment began to shed light on the nature of the progenitors of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "groundbased observations of the afterglow revealed a near coincidence of the grb with the optical light of a faint galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "later , deeper groundbased images ( @xcite ) and high resolution images from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) showed the light from the fading transient clearly embedded in a faint galaxy ( @xcite ) , the putative host of the grb .",
    "further , these hst images showed a measurable offset between the host galaxy centroid and the afterglow .",
    "though by no means definitive , the offset of grb 970228 rendered an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) origin unlikely ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two most popular progenitor scenarios  coalescence of binary compact stellar remnants and the explosion of a massive star ( `` collapsar'')imply that the gamma - ray burst rate should closely follow the massive star formation rate in the universe . in",
    "both formation scenarios a black hole is created as a byproduct ; however , the scenarios differ in two important respects . first , only very massive progenitors ( @xmath3 ; fryer , woosley , & hartmann 1999 ) will produce grbs in the single star model whereas the progenitors of neutron star ",
    "neutron star binaries need only originate with @xmath4 .",
    "second , the scenarios predict a distinct distribution of physical offsets ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) in that the coalescence site of merging remnants could occur far from the binary birthplace ( owning to substantial systemic velocities acquired during neutron star formation through supernovae ) whereas exploding massive stars will naturally occur in star - forming regions . in relation to the predicted offset of grb 970228 ,",
    "bloom  ( 1999 ) further noted the importance of redshift to determine the luminosity ( and infer mass ) of the host galaxy : massive galaxies more readily retain binary remnant progenitors .",
    "thus the relationship of grbs to their hosts is most effectively exploited with redshift by setting the physical scale of any observed angular offset and critically constraining the mass ( as proxied by host luminosity ) .",
    "the redshift of grb 970228 also plays a critical role in the emerging supernova  grb link .",
    "following the report of an apparent supernova component in the afterglow of grb 980326 ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) , the afterglow light curves of grb 970228 were reanalyzed : both reichart ( 1999 ) and galama et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found evidence for a supernova component .",
    "this interpretation , however , relies critically on the knowledge of the redshift to grb 970228 to set the restframe wavelength of the apparent broadband break of the sn component .    finally ,",
    "knowledge of redshift is essential to derive the physical parameters of the grb itself , primarily the energy scale .",
    "we now know , for instance , that the typical grb releases about @xmath5 erg in gamma - rays .",
    "the distribution of observed isotropic - equivalent grb energies is , however , very broad ( _ cf_.  kulkarni et al .  2000 ) .    recognizing these needs we implemented an aggressive spectroscopy campaign on the host of grb 970228 as detailed in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] .",
    "the redshift determination was first reported by djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and is described in more detail in  [ sec:0228redshift ] .",
    "we then use this redshift and the spectrum of the host galaxy in ",
    "[ sec:0228imp ] to set the physical scale of the observables : energetics , star - formation rates , and offsets .",
    "based on this and photometric imaging from hst we demonstrate in  [ sec : host ] that the host is an underluminous , but otherwise normal galaxy .",
    "lastly , we compare the host with that of the field galaxy population .",
    "spectra of the host galaxy were obtained on the w.  m.  keck observatory 10 m telescope",
    "( keck ii ) atop mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "observations were conducted over the course of several observing runs : ut 1997 august 13 ,",
    "ut 1997 september 14 , ut 1997 november 1 and 2830 , and ut 1998 february 2124 .",
    "the observing conditions were variable , from marginal ( patchy / thin cirrus or mediocre seeing ) to excellent , and on some nights no significant detection of the host was made ; such data were excluded from the subsequent analysis . on most nights , multiple exposures ( 2 to 5 ) of 1800 sec",
    "were obtained , with the object dithered on the spectrograph slit by several arcsec between the exposures .",
    "the net total useful on - target exposure was approximately 11 hours from all of the runs combined .",
    "all data were obtained using the _ low - resolution imaging spectrometer _",
    "( lris ; @xcite ) with 300 lines mm@xmath6 grating and a 1.0 arcsec wide long slit , giving an effective instrumental resolution fwhm @xmath7  .",
    "slit position angle was always set to @xmath8 , with star s1 ( @xcite ) always placed on the slit , and used to determine the spectrum trace along the chip ; galaxy spectra were then extracted at a position 2.8 arcsec east of the star s1 .",
    "efforts were made to observe the target at hour angles so as to make this slit position angle as close to parallactic as possible .",
    "exposures of an internal flat - field lamp and arc lamps were obtained at comparable telescope pointings immediately following the target observations .",
    "exposures of standard stars from oke & gunn ( 1983 ) and massey  ( 1998 ) were obtained and used to measure the instrument response curve , although on some nights the flux zero points were unreliable due to non - photometric conditions .",
    "wavelength solutions were obtained from arc lamps in the standard manner , and then a second - order correction was determined from the wavelengths of isolated strong night sky lines , and applied to the wavelength solutions .",
    "this procedure largely eliminates systematic errors due to the instrument flexure , and is necessary in order to combine the data obtained during separate nights .",
    "the final wavelength calibrations have the r.m.s .",
    "@xmath9  , as determined from the scatter of the night sky line centers .",
    "all spectra were then rebinned to a common wavelength scale with a sampling of 2.5   ( the original pixel scale is @xmath10  ) , using a gaussian with a @xmath11   as the interpolating / weighting function .",
    "this is effectively a very conservative smoothing of the spectrum , since the actual instrumental resolution corresponds to @xmath12  .",
    "individual spectra were extracted and combined using a statistical weighting based on the signal - to - noise ratio determined from the data themselves ( rather than by the exposure time ) . since some of the spectra were obtained in non - photometric conditions , the final spectrum flux zero - point calibration is also unreliable , but the spectrum shape should be unaffected .",
    "we use direct photometry of the galaxy to correct this zero - point error ( see below ) .",
    "our uncorrected spectrum gives a spectroscopic magnitude @xmath13 mag for the galaxy .",
    "direct photometry from the hst data indicates @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "given that some of our spectra were obtained through thin cirrus , this discrepancy is not surprising .",
    "thus , in order to bring our measurements to a consistent system , we multiply our flux values by a constant factor of 1.66 , but we thus also inherit the systematic zero - point error of @xmath15% from the hst photometry .",
    "there is some uncertainty regarding the value of the foreground extinction in this direction ( see discussion in  [ sec:0228host ] ) .",
    "we apply a galactic extinction correction by assuming @xmath16 mag from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath17 , and the galactic extinction curve from cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1988 ) to correct the spectrum .",
    "all fluxes and luminosities quoted below incorporate both the flux zero - point and the galactic extinction corrections .",
    "the final combined spectrum of the galaxy is shown in figure [ fig:0228spec ] .",
    "two strong emission lines are seen , [ o ii ] 3727 and [ o iii ] 5007 , thus confirming the initial redshift interpretation based on the [ o ii ] 3727 line alone ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately the instrumental resolution was too coarse to resolve the [ o ii ] 3727 doublet .",
    "the weighted mean redshift is @xmath18 . a possible weak emission line of [ ne iii ]",
    "3869 is also seen .",
    "unfortunately , the strong night sky oh lines preclude the measurements of the h@xmath19 4861 and [ o iii ] 4959 lines , as well as the higher balmer lines .",
    "the corrected [ o ii ] 3727 line flux is @xmath20 erg @xmath21 s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 , and its observed equivalent width is @xmath22  , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath23   in the restframe .",
    "this is not unusual for field galaxies in this redshift range ( @xcite ) .",
    "the [ ne iii ] 3869 line , if real , has a flux of at most 10% of the [ o ii ] 3727 line , which is reasonable for an actively star forming galaxy .",
    "the corrected [ o iii ] 5007 line flux is @xmath24 erg @xmath21 s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 , and its observed equivalent width is @xmath25  , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath26   in the restframe . for the h@xmath19 line ,",
    "we derive an upper limit of @xmath27 erg @xmath21 s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 ( @xmath28 ) , and for its observed equivalent width @xmath29  .",
    "we note however that this measurement may be severely affected by the poor night sky subtraction .",
    "the continuum flux at @xmath30 , corresponding to @xmath31 , is @xmath32jy , with our measurement uncertain by @xmath33% .",
    "the continuum flux at @xmath34 , corresponding to the restframe @xmath35 band , is @xmath36jy , with our measurement uncertain by @xmath37% . above",
    ", we report only the statistical uncertainties of all fluxes ; an additional systematic uncertainty of @xmath15% is inherited from the overall flux zero - point uncertainty .",
    "for the following discussion , we will assume a flat cosmology as suggested by recent results ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) with @xmath38 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath41 , the luminosity distance is @xmath42 cm , and 1 arcsec corresponds to 7.65 proper kpc or 13.0 comoving kpc in projection .",
    "the gamma - ray fluence ( integrated flux over time ) is converted from count rates under the assumption of a grb spectrum , the spectral evolution , and the true duration of the grb .",
    "these quantities are estimated from the grb data itself but can lead to large uncertainties ( a factor of few ) in the fluence determination . in table",
    "[ tab : energetics ] we summarize the fluence of grb 970228 as observed by all high energy experiments that detected the grb .",
    "we determine the implied energy release ( col .  5 , table [ tab : energetics ] )",
    "assuming isotropic emission .",
    "further we `` standardize '' the energetics to the restframe 302000 kev in the following manner .",
    "we first normalize the observed fluences in a given bandpass ( col .  2 and 3 ) to a bandpass defined by @xmath43 to @xmath44 kev by a ratio of the integrated spectral shape over these two bandpasses .",
    "the implied energy release is then found assuming isotropic emission and using the luminosity distance measure for the assumed cosmology .",
    "if no spectral fit is reported we find the median energy implied by assuming the spectral shape is each of the average 54 spectra from band  ( 1993 ) .",
    "the reported errors reflect the uncertainty in the redshift measure , fluence , and spectral shape .    given the significantly higher gamma - ray spectral and timing resolution of the tgrs instrument relative to the others , we favor the isotropic energy implied by the tgrs analysis : [ 302000 kev restframe ] . that the implied energy is a factor of @xmath453 higher using measurements from bepposax and ulysses reflects the importance of high signal - to - noise spectroscopy in ascertaining the fluence and hence the energy release . the slow decline and absence of a strong break in the optical light curve ( _ e.g. _ ,  galama  1997 )",
    "suggests that the grb emission was nearly isotropic ( see also @xcite ) and so the knowledge of @xmath46 is primarily limited by the accuracy of the fluence measurement .      for the purpose determining the position of the grb within its host",
    ", we examined the hst / stis observations taken on 4.7 sept 1997 ut ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observation consisted of eight 575@xmath47s stis clear ( ccd50 ) exposures paired in to four 1150s to facilitate removal of cosmic rays .",
    "we processed these images using the drizzle technique of fruchter & hook ( 1997 ) to create a final image with a plate scale of 0.0254 arcsec pixel@xmath6 . to enhance the low - surface brightness host galaxy we smoothed this image with a gaussian with @xmath48 arcsec .",
    "the optical transient is well - detected in figure [ fig : host ] ( point source towards the south ) and clearly offset from the bulk of the detectable emission of the host .",
    "two morphological features of the host stand out : a bright knot manifested as an sharp 6-@xmath49 peak near the centroid of the host to north of the transient and an extension from this knot towards the transient .",
    "although , as we demonstrate below , this host is a subluminous galaxy ( _ i.e. _ ,  not a classic late - type @xmath50 spiral galaxy ) we attribute these features to a nucleus and a spiral - arm , respectively .",
    "it is not unusual for dwarf galaxies to exhibit these canonical hubble - diagram structures ( s.  odewahn , private communication ) .",
    "these feature have not previously been noted in the literature .",
    "centroiding the transient and the nucleus components within a 3 pixel aperture radius about their respective peak , we find an angular offset of @xmath51 milliarcsec between the nucleus and the optical transient .",
    "with our assumed cosmology , this amounts to a projected physical distance of @xmath52 kpc .",
    "we found half - light radius of the host galaxy using our final drizzled hst / stis   3 pixel region around the position of the optical transient and inspect the curve  of  growth centered on the central bright knot , the supposed nucleus and estimate the half - light radius to be 0.31 arcsec or ( physical ) at a redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "the half - light radius visually estimated from curve  of  growth in the wfpc f814w and f606w filters ( see @xcite ) is comparable .    although there is some debate ( at the 0.3 mag level in @xmath53 ) as to the proper level of galactic extinction toward grb 970228 ( @xcite ) we have chosen to adopt the value @xmath54 found from the dust maps of @xcite and a galactic reddening curve @xmath55 . using extensive reanalysis of the _ hst _ imaging data by galama  2000 the extinction corrected broadband colors of the host galaxy as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "these measures , consistent with those of castander & lamb ( 1999 ) and fruchter  ( 1999 ) , are derived from the wfpc2 colors and broadband stis flux .",
    "the errors reflect both the statistical error and the uncertainty in the spectral energy distribution of the host galaxy .",
    "we have not included a contribution from the uncertainty in the galactic extinction . using the nicmos measurement from fruchter  ( 1999 ) the extinction corrected infrared magnitude",
    "is @xmath59 .",
    "using the zero - points from fukugita  ( 1996 ) , the extinction - corrected ab - magnitudes of the host galaxy are : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "to facilitate comparison with moderate redshift galaxy surveys (  [ sec : host ] ) we compute the restframe @xmath35-band magnitude of the host galaxy . from the observed continuum in the restframe @xmath35 band , we derive the absolute magnitude @xmath63 mag [ or ] , _ i.e.",
    "_ , only slightly brighter than the lmc now . for our chosen value of @xmath64 , an @xmath50 galaxy at @xmath65 has @xmath66 mag , and thus the host at the observed epoch has @xmath67 today .",
    "its observed morphology from the hst images is also consistent with a dwarf , low - surface brightness galaxy .      from the [ o ii ] 3727 line flux , we derive the line luminosity @xmath68 erg s@xmath6 ( @xmath69% random ) ( @xmath70% systematic ) .",
    "using the star formation rate estimator from @xcite , we derive the sfr @xmath71 yr@xmath6 . using a 3-@xmath49 limit on the h@xmath19 flux",
    ", we estimate @xmath72 erg s@xmath6 . assuming the h@xmath73/h@xmath19 ratio of @xmath74 for the case b recombination and a range of excitation temperatures",
    ", we can derive a pseudo - h@xmath73 based estimate of the star formation rate ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) , sfr @xmath75 yr@xmath6 , but we consider this to be less reliable than the [ o ii ] 3727 measurement . from the uv continuum luminosity at @xmath76 , following madau , pozzetti & dickinson ( 1998 ) , we derive sfr @xmath77 yr@xmath6 .",
    "we note that the net uncertainties for each of these independent sfr estimates are at least 50% , and the overall agreement is encouraging .",
    "while we do not know the effective extinction corrections in the host galaxy itself , these are likely to be modest , given its blue colors ( _ cf .",
    "_   [ sec : host ] ) , and are unlikely to change our results by more than a factor of two .",
    "( we hasten to point out that we are completely insensitive to any fully obscured star formation component , if any is present . ) on the whole , the galaxy appears to have a rather modest ( unobscured ) star formation rate , @xmath78 yr@xmath6 .",
    "given the relatively normal equivalent width of the [ o ii ] 3727 line , even the star formation per unit mass does not seem to be extraordinarily high .",
    "at @xmath79 , the host galaxy of grb 970228 is a sub - luminous galaxy roughly 2.7 mag below @xmath50 at comparable redshifts ( @xcite ) .",
    "galama  ( 2000 ) , based on the redshift of grb 970228 , recently found that an sc galaxy spectral energy distribution reasonably fits the optical  ir photometric fluxes of the host galaxy .",
    "this differs from the analysis of castander & lamb ( 1999 ) which would , now given the redshift of @xmath80 , favor a classification of an `` irregular '' galaxy having undergone burst of star - formation over the past few hundred myr .",
    "clearly it is difficult to precisely determine the galaxy type without more precise photometry and knowledge of the true galactic extinction , but our identification of a nucleus and possible arm structure (  [ sec : off ] ) supports the idea that the host is a late - type dwarf . indeed , the host has similar characteristics to that of the large magellanic cloud .",
    "we further note that compared with the simard  ( 1999 ) , the magnitude - size relation of the host galaxy is consistent with that observed for late - type and dwarf - irregular galaxies .",
    "the flat continuum suggests little restframe extinction in this galaxy .",
    "we found the isophotal @xmath81 color of galaxies in the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) using the published photometry from thompson  ( 1999 ) ( nicmos : f160w ) and williams  ( 1996 ) ( wfpc4 : f606w filter ) .",
    "all wfpc object identifications within 0.3 arcsec of a nicmos identification are plotted in figure [ fig : hdf ] along with the dereddened color of the host galaxy of grb 970228 .",
    "our field selection essentially biases the color ",
    "magnitude relation towards redder objects and would serve to accentuate the locus of the field with a blue galaxy . even with this bias , there is no indication that the host is substantially more blue than field galaxies at comparable magnitudes .",
    "this conclusion  that the host galaxy of grb 970228 is not exceptionally blue  is at odds with that of fruchter  ( 1999 ) who have claimed that the host galaxy is unusually blue as compared with typical field galaxies .",
    "the difference may be due to the fact that the fruchter  ( 1999 ) analysis compared the host colors with a significantly more shallow infrared survey than the nicmos hdf essentially masking the trend for faint galaxies to appear more blue .",
    "figure [ fig:0228balmer ] shows a section of the median - binned spectrum of the host galaxy . the balmer break is clearly detected , with an amplitude @xmath82 mag , which is typical for the balmer break selected population of field galaxies at @xmath83 ( k.  adelberger , private communication ) . for reference",
    "we also plot several population synthesis model spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "the top panel shows model spectra for a galaxy with a uniform star formation rate , which may be a reasonable time - averaged approximation for a normal late - type galaxy .",
    "the correspondence is reasonably good and does not depend on the model age .",
    "the bottom panel shows models with an instantaneous burst of star formation . in order to match the data , we require fine - tuning of the post - burst age to be @xmath84 yr .",
    "no attempt was made to optimize the fit or to seek best model parameters and the purpose of this comparison is simply illustrative .",
    "clearly , if there was an ongoing or very recent burst of star formation , the spectrum would be much flatter , with a weaker balmer break .",
    "we have determined the redshift of the host galaxy of grb 970228 to be @xmath0 based on [ o ii ] 3727 and [ o iii ] 5007 line emission .",
    "the implied energy release @xmath85 [ 302000 kev restframe ] is on the smaller end of , but still comparable to , the handful of other bursts with energy determinations ( _ e.g. _ ,  kulkarni  2000 ) .",
    "the absence of a detectable break in the afterglow light curve we take to imply that any collimation of emission ( _ i.e. _ ,  jetting ) neglegibly reduces the estimate of total energy release in grb 970228 ( although @xcite , using late - time radio data , have found that even without an optical break , grb 970508 may have been collimated ) .",
    "most grb transients appear spatially coincident with faint host galaxies , disfavoring the merging ns hypothesis ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the coincidence of grb 970508 with its host ( @xcite ) is particularly constraining given the excellent spatial coincidence of the grb with the center of a dwarf galaxy ( _ cf . _",
    "the transient of grb 970228 lies @xmath86 kpc from the center of the galaxy , about 1 kpc in projection outside the half - light radius of the galaxy . from the above analysis",
    "we have shown , like grb 970508 , the host is underluminous ( @xmath87 ) , and by assumption , undermassive relative to @xmath50 galaxies . according to bloom  ( 1999 ) ,",
    "about 50% of merging neutron binaries should occur beyond 3.5 kpc in projection of such dwarf galaxies .",
    "thus , by itself , the offset of grb 970228 from its host does not particularly favor a progenitor model .    with a star - formation rate of , the host of grb 970228 is forming stars only at a moderately higher rate than comparable galaxies in the local universe .",
    "this result is not surprising given that , on a whole , the universal rate of star - formation increases steeply at least out until redshift @xmath88 .",
    "if the association of grbs with massive stars is correct , however , grb hosts should reveal an increased propensity to form massive stars over and above their counterpart field galaxies .",
    "moreover , the massive star formation rate should be vigorous at the time grb occurs since massive stars require a negligible time ( compared to typical star - formation burst durations ) to explode since zero - age main sequence .",
    "in @xmath89-band magnitude the host is near the median of grb hosts observed to date but in absolute @xmath35-band magnitude the host at the faint end of the distribution . of the host galaxies",
    "detected thus far only grb 970508 is as comparably faint to the host of grb 970228 .",
    "except in angular extent , the host galaxies of grb 970228 and grb 970508 ( @xcite ) bear a striking resemblance .",
    "both appear to be sub - luminous ( @xmath90 ) , compact and blue .",
    "spectroscopy of both reveal the presence of the [ ne iii ] 3869 line , indicative of recent very massive star formation . however , such properties are not shared by all of the grb hosts studied to date .",
    "we note too the rather curious trend that the two grbs themselves appear to have similar properties in that they decay slowly , are the two least luminous in term of grb energetics , and do not exhibit evidence of a strong break in the light curve .",
