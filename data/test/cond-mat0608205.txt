    "multiplicatively interacting stochastic processes(misps ) have been investigated quite actively for past some years@xcite .",
    "it is known that these processes generate power - law distributions at the tail of a probability distribution function(pdf ) .",
    "they are considered one of probable candidates for explaining power - law tails observed widely in natural phenomena@xcite , such as velocity distributions of inelastically colliding particles and wealth distributions in economics . there",
    "exist two parameters characterizing the processes : a growth rate of systems and a power - law exponent .",
    "these are able to be calculated analytically .",
    "it is found that both parameters vary continuously depending on microscopic interaction parameters in a certain region .",
    "this fact shows that the power - law behavior of misps is vastly different from that of usual critical phenomena . in critical phenomena ,",
    "power - law behavior appears when the parameters are controlled only at a critical point . in misps ,",
    "on the other hand , a power - law tail emerges in a certain region of the parameter space , which suggests ubiquity of power laws due to misps .",
    "the second difference is universality . in the former ,",
    "the power - law exponent is independent of microscopic parameters , and therefore becomes an indicator of universality classes . in the latter ,",
    "the exponent depends on microscopic details and universality does not hold .",
    "it is known that one - body random multiplicative models also show power - law tails in some conditions@xcite .",
    "the dependence of the exponent on interaction parameters indicates that many - body processes is irreducible to one - body processes because interaction parameters are specific for many - body ones .",
    "it will be reported that in weighted interactions , many - body processes belong to a different universality class from that of one - body ones@xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "here , let us introduce the method of fourier transform to derive the growth rate and power - law exponent@xcite .",
    "we consider a @xmath3particle system defined as follows .",
    "each particle has positive quantities @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) . at each time step ,",
    "two particles labeled by @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are picked up randomly from @xmath9 particles and interact with each other , where two quantities @xmath10 are transformed into @xmath11 by the rule @xmath12 with positive interaction parameters @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath14 , this process is described by the following master equation .",
    "@xmath15 , \\nonumber \\label{eq : mastereq - z } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a pdf of quantities .",
    "after the fourier transform @xmath17 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mastereq - z ] ) becomes @xmath18 in this model , the total value of the quantity is not conserved . in the long time limit , therefore , the pdf diverges to infinity or shrinks to zero depending on the value of interaction parameters @xmath19 .",
    "then , the scaling relations @xmath20 are assumed , where @xmath1 is a scaling parameter representing a growth rate of systems .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling - relation - k ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : mastereq - k ] ) , we obtain @xmath21 differentiating eq .",
    "( [ eq : mastereq - k - scaled ] ) with respect to @xmath22 , and then substituting @xmath23 , we obtain the growth rate of systems @xmath24 performing the same calculations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mastereq - k ] ) , we find @xmath1 is actually the growth rate of the first - order moment , that is , @xmath25 .",
    "suppose @xmath26 consists of a combination of regular and singular terms , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a non - integer number in general . in this case ,",
    "the small leading term of @xmath29 reflects the power - law tail @xmath30 , where @xmath2 is a power - law exponent . substituting @xmath31 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : mastereq - k - scaled ] ) , we find a transcendental equation @xmath32 from this transcendental equation together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) , we finally obtain a non - trivial solution @xmath33 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : minselect](a ) .",
    "this solution corresponds to the power - law exponent . in this way",
    ", the growth rate of systems @xmath1 and the power - law exponent @xmath2 are calculated analytically .",
    "in the case @xmath0 , the method of fourier transform mentioned above does not work because the first - order moment diverges , and thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) does not hold anymore .",
    "just one equation ( [ eq : teq ] ) remains to hold and two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 becomes indeterminate .",
    "ben - avraham _ _ et al.__@xcite discovered that when @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are determined to fulfill the following relations . @xmath34",
    "these relations indicates that the value of the growth rate @xmath1 is equal to the tangential gradient of @xmath35 going through the origin as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : minselect](b ) .",
    "in other words , it can be said that the growth rate @xmath1 becomes minimum under the condition that eq .",
    "( [ eq : teq ] ) has a solution .",
    "for this reason , we call this mechanism _ the principle of minimum growth rate_. to our knowledge , the principle has never been explained theoretically . in this paper",
    ", we derive the principle by applying a method of moment inequalities , instead of that of fourier transform .",
    "substituting eq .  ( [ eq : scaling - relation - z ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : mastereq - z ] ) , we obtain @xmath36 .",

    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) is derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rescaled - mastereq ] ) at @xmath40 . substituting the inequalities of lemma @xmath41 in the paper by bobylev _ _ et al.__@xcite , we find the inequalities of moments @xmath42 for all @xmath43 , where @xmath44 are certain bounded functions .",
    "equation ( [ eq : moment - inequalities ] ) means that the solution @xmath45 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : teq ] ) represents the order of divergent moment @xmath46 , and thus the power - law exponent @xmath2 . in this way , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are derived from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : teq ] ) in the case @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , this method leads to the same results as the method of fourier transform did . in the case",

    "@xmath48 for all @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",

    "( [ eq : xy - ineq ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : rescaled - mastereq ] ) , we obtain the conditional inequality .",
    "@xmath51 for all @xmath49 .",
    "it follows that when the power - law exponent exists in a region @xmath0 , the growth rate @xmath1 and the exponent @xmath2 is determined so as to fulfill the next two conditions .    1 .",
    "there exist a solution @xmath45 in @xmath49 satisfying @xmath52 .",

    "( [ eq : minselect - teq ] ) .",
    "consequently , the principle of minimum growth rate is derived theoretically .",
    "to sum up , we have successfully given a theoretical explanation of the principle of minimum growth rate in many - body stochastic processes with multiplicative interactions . in the process of deriving the principle",
    ", we used the method of moment inequalities .",
    "this method made clear the correspondence between the solution of the transcendental equations and the divergence of moments as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : moment - inequalities ] ) . when @xmath47 , the results coincide with those given by the method of fourier transform . when @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) breaks down because of the divergence of the first - order moment . from the estimate of inequalities",
    ", we obtained the conditional inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma - condition ] ) which is replaced with eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) .    in order to obtain the principle of minimum growth rate , it is essential to estimate inequalities derived from the master equation of the processes . after performing fourier transform ,",
    "it is difficult to handle inequalities because of the existence of imaginary parts , which is probably the main reason why the principle had not been explained .",
    "it can be concluded that in the asymptotic analysis of this kind of stochastic processes , the method of moment inequalities are quite useful .",
