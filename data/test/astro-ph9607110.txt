    "the low mass x - ray binary 4u1608@xmath052 was first observed in 1971 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is the same source as the norma burster , from which the first x - ray bursts were discovered ( @xcite ) , independent from the x - ray burst discovered by grindlay et al .",
    "( 1976 ) from 4u1820@xmath030 .",
    "4u1608@xmath052 is a soft x - ray transient , which shows outbursts at intervals varying between @xmath2 days and several years ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hasinger and van der klis ( 1989 ) classified 4u1608@xmath052 as an atoll source , based on the correlated x - ray spectral variability and @xmath3 10 hz noise in the x - ray intensity that is characteristic for this class of objects . in the standard description of atoll sources",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) the correlated changes in x - ray spectral and timing properties are attributed to changes in mass accretion rate . at low accretion rates ( island state of atoll sources )",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 4u1608@xmath052 contains a hard power law component ( up to about 100 kev ) somewhat similar to the x - ray spectra of black - hole candidates in their low state ( @xcite ) .",
    "yoshida et al . ( 1993 ) found the power density spectrum of 4u1608@xmath052 in its island state has the shape characteristic of black hole candidates in the low state , and reported 29 hz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) from this source , which is unusual in atoll sources .",
    "in this paper we report the discovery of 650850 hz qpo from 4u1608@xmath052 .",
    "a preliminary announcement of this discovery was already made by van paradijs et al .",
    "4u1608@xmath052 is the second atoll source showing 800 hz qpo after 4u1728@xmath034 ( @xcite ) .",
    "qpo at 800 and 1100 hz have recently also been reported for the z - source sco x-1 ( van der klis 1996a , b ) .",
    "we observed 4u1608@xmath052 using the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board of nasa s rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ; @xcite ) during the decay of an x - ray outburst on march 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 of 1996 .",
    "each observation had a duration of several satellite orbits , in each of which the source was visible for about 3600 seconds , and occulted by the earth for about 1800 seconds .",
    "the source count rate during the march 3 observation varied between 2910 and 3400 c / s ( in the pca energy range of 560 kev ) , on march 6 it had declined to 530820 c / s , and on march 9 and 12 it was 610730 and 460710 c / s , respectively .",
    "no x - ray bursts were seen .",
    "the background count rate was about 90 c / s .",
    "in all observations , data were collected with a sampling rate of 8 khz , except for the march 6 observation which used 16 khz sampling .",
    "no spectral analysis of the data was done yet , but the drop by a factor of 5 in x - ray intensity could be due to a change from banana to island state ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "we calculated power spectra of these data .",
    "we find that during most of our observations these contain a clear qpo peak at high frequencies , which we fitted with a constant level plus a lorentzian .",
    "we corrected the results of these fits for background and differential dead time ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath4 values of the fits were all @xmath5 .",
    "in the march 3 and 6 observations , a clear qpo peak can be seen in the power spectrum ( see fig .  1 for an example ) . in figure 2 ,",
    "the dynamical power spectra of these two observations are shown .",
    "the centroid frequency of the qpo varies between 850 and 890 hz and the peak is always narrow with q values ( centroid frequency divided by full width at half maximum ) of up to @xmath6 . during the first orbit of the march 3 observation , the qpo frequency variations covered the 850890 hz range in less than 1000 s.    we made fits to the qpo in contiguous segments of 100 seconds of the march 3 , orbit 1 data , where the qpo frequency changes rapidly .",
    "the rms amplitude of the qpo is between @xmath16 and @xmath18 % and its fwhm between 4 and 15 hz . in figure 3 ,",
    "the rms amplitude and fwhm are plotted as a function of qpo frequency .",
    "as the qpo frequency increases , the peak becomes weaker and broader .    in the second orbit of march 3 and in the march 6 data , the qpo frequency changes much less but still significantly ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the qpo strength , centroid and width values of orbit 2 of march 3 are consistent with those of orbit 1 .",
    "the march 6 peak widths are also consistent with those of march 3 for the frequency range that they have in common ( 850 - 870 hz ) , but the fractional rms amplitude is twice as high ( @xmath1 14 % ) . in both observations , changes in qpo frequency occur down to time scales of tens of seconds , as can be seen in fig .  2 .    in the march 9 observation , no qpo are evident in the dynamical power spectrum . analyzing a power spectrum averaged over the entire observation we find a broad peak with an amplitude of 13.9 @xmath7 0.9 % rms , a fwhm of 131 @xmath7 19 hz and a centroid frequency of 691 @xmath7 6 hz . the fwhm of the qpo must be intrinsically higher during this observation than during the earlier ones , or with this amplitude it would have been visible in the dynamical power spectrum .    on march 12 , no @xmath8",
    "hz qpo signal is detected in the integrated power spectrum , but a very weak and broad band - limited noise component can be seen at @xmath190 hz .",
    "it is uncertain whether or not this feature is related to the @xmath1800 hz qpo .    on march 6",
    ", there is a correlation between x - ray count rate and qpo frequency .",
    "however , in the march 3 observation the changes in qpo frequency are not well correlated to the count rate changes , the drop in count rate by more than a factor 4 from march 3 to march 6 does not affect qpo frequency ( or peak width ) , and in the march 9 observation , at nearly the same count rate as during march 6 , the qpo frequency is 150 hz lower than before .",
    "it is therefore possible that the correlation on march 6 is coincidence .",
    "we looked for the presence of a harmonic to the qpo peak at twice the centroid frequency in the march 3 , orbit 2 data ; the 3@xmath9 upper limit to such a component is 1.7 % rms , corresponding to an amplitude ratio of @xmath10    we measured the photon energy dependence of the qpo in the second orbit of the march 3 data by dividing the data into 8 contiguous energy bands centered at 5.0 , 7.1 , 9.4 , 11.8 , 14.8 , 18.2 , 22.2 and 27.2 kev .",
    "we used this data because of the strength and stable frequency of the qpo , making it easy to construct an average power spectrum from each band .",
    "we analyzed the power spectra as described above .",
    "the rms amplitude of the qpo is plotted as a function of energy in figure 4 .",
    "the qpo relative amplitude increases up to about 12 kev .",
    "in several respects , the @xmath1800 hz qpo we found in 4u1608@xmath052 are very similar to those in 4u1728@xmath034 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the frequency ranges , coherencies , peak shapes and strengths are all approximately the same",
    ". an important difference of the @xmath1800 hz qpo in these two atoll sources with those at 800 and 1100 hz in the z  source sco  x-1 ( van der klis et al .",
    ", 1996a , b ) is the much lower ( @xmath1 factor 10 ) rms amplitude of the qpo in the latter .",
    "this could be due to scattering in circumstellar material or additional , unmodulated flux in the case of the near - eddington accretion thought to characterize z  sources .",
    "there are two lines of reasoning that suggest that the 800 hz qpo in 4u1608@xmath052 may be due to a beat between keplerian disk rotation and neutron star spin .",
    "however , our data also provide a strong argument against this interpretation .",
    "first , the correlation between the various qpo properties during march 3 , orbit 1 is very reminiscent of the horizontal branch oscillations ( hbo ) as seen in the z source gx5@xmath01 ( @xcite , cf .  their fig .",
    "when the qpo frequency increases , the peak width increases and the rms amplitude goes down .",
    "the rms vs.  photon energy spectrum of the qpo is very similar to that of gx5@xmath01 ( @xcite ) , which increases from  4 to  15 % rms between 2 and 15 kev .",
    "the width of the @xmath140 hz qpo of gx5 - 1 is between 5 and 12 hz ( @xcite ) , very similar to the 5 - 15 hz width of the @xmath1800 hz qpo of 4u1608@xmath052 .",
    "a small difference is that in gx5 - 1 the rms amplitude of the qpo is between 2 and 6 % , which is slightly lower than the 5 - 15 % seen in 4u1608@xmath052 .",
    "the beat frequency model ( @xcite , @xcite ) for hbo in z  sources could , with an assumed neutron star spin rate of a few 100 hz and with the lower magnetic field strengths expected for atoll sources as compared to z sources ( @xcite ) very easily produce an 800 hz beat frequency .",
    "second , strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1996b ) have proposed that the 800 hz qpo in 4u1728@xmath034 can be interpreted in terms of a beat frequency between the keplerian disk frequency and a neutron star spin rate of 363 hz .",
    "the report that five x - ray bursts of that source show a relatively coherent signal at 363 hz , and the difference in frequency between the 800 hz qpo peak with another peak present in their data remains consistent with being equal to 363 hz across the observations .",
    "however , in spite of these arguments , the absence of a correlation between x - ray intensity on the one hand and qpo frequency and rms amplitude on the other hand poses a major problem for a beat frequency model interpretation .",
    "the qpo frequency remains constant near 850 hz between 3 and 6 march while the count rate drops by more than a factor 4 , from @xmath13200 to @xmath1600 counts / sec ( sect .  2 ) .",
    "the beat frequency model predicts that if the qpo frequency remains constant , the mass flow through the inner edge of the disk should remain constant as well .",
    "our data therefore are inconsistent with a beat frequency model interpretation if all accretion takes place via the inner edge of the disk .",
    "we note that the presence of a hypothetical additional ( non - disk ) mass flow component contributing more than 75% of the total flux on march 3 and much weaker on march 6 can not easily resolve this discrepancy .",
    "the rms amplitude of the qpo only increases by a factor 2 from march 3 to 6 while the x - ray intensity drops by a factor of more than 4 , whereas a similar fractional change would be predicted in this explanation . only by invoking rather large and entirely ad - hoc changes in the beaming or bolometric correction",
    "could the model be maintained .",
    "the 150 hz drop in qpo from march 6 to march 9 without a change in count rate presents similar difficulties .",
    "further observations of 4u1608@xmath052 during other outbursts , and study of its x - ray bursts are required to shed further light on the relation of the 800 hz qpo in 4u1608@xmath052 with those in 4u1728@xmath034 , and with the qpo in sco x-1 .",
