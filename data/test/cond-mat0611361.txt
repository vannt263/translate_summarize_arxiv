    ", there is general agreement that in three dimensions , the isotropic - nematic transition occurs at large enough density , if the length - to - width ratio of the molecules is large enough @xcite . in the case of two - dimensional systems of hard needles in a plane , there is no spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry , but the high - density phase has orientational correlations that decay as a power - law @xcite .",
    "the situation is much less clear in the case of lattice models of straight hard rods of length @xmath0 .",
    "the only analytically soluble case is that of dimers ( @xmath6 ) , for which it is known that the orientational correlations have an exponential decay for all densities , except the full - coverage limit , which shows power - law correlations in all dimensions @xcite .",

    "early monte carlo studies of semi - flexible @xmath0-mers on a square lattice showed no long - range orientational order for any density or temperature @xcite .",
    "degennes and prost , in 1995 , in their book on liquid crystals , wrote `` it is not quite certain that such a lattice model , even for large @xmath10 ( long molecule ) , will lead to a transition '' @xcite .",

    "we find very strong numerical evidence that the system shows nematic order at intermediate densities for @xmath11 .",
    "we are not able to study systems near @xmath12 in our simulations , because the relaxation time increases very fast with density .",
    "however , there is fairly convincing numerical evidence ( but no proof ) , that there is no long - range order at @xmath12 , and so there must be a second phase transition as density is increased . to the best of our knowledge",

    "the point of onset of the nematic order is not so easy to determine from the data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] we show the distribution of @xmath55 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 for different densities @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath56 the distribution is centered around 0 implying that there is no preferred orientation in the configurations and that the system is in isotropic phase . while @xmath57 , the distribution shifts to the right indicating onset of a nematic phase . also , the order parameter increases gradually , indicating a continuous phase transition .",
    "since we are not able to determine the critical point with very good precision , we did not attempt to study the critical exponents characterizing the transition .",
    "as there are two competing ordered states near the transition , one would expect this transition to be in the ising universality class .",
    "for intermediate densities , the state of the system is well - approximated by the fully aligned state in which all the rods are in the same orientation ( say horizontal ) .",
    "we can determine the entropy of the system approximately , by considering it as a perturbation from the fully aligned state .",

    "@xmath69 is expressible in terms of the probability of finding @xmath0 consecutive empty sites in the vertical direction in the reference state .",
    "since the configurations of different horizontal rods are independent in the reference state , and the probability of finding a random site unoccupied is @xmath63 , we get @xmath70 . using cumulant expansion , it is easy to see that @xmath71    the value of @xmath69 is quite small even for moderately large values of @xmath63 and small @xmath0 , thus for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the lowest order term in the perturbation expansion of the fraction of vertical @xmath0-mers in the nematic state is only of the order of @xmath74 .",
    "this is much less than about @xmath75 fraction of vertical bonds seen in fig .",
    "thus the higher order terms are important .",
    "the second order term @xmath76 can be expressed in terms of the @xmath30-point correlation functions of the unperturbed problem .",

    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath81 as there are two ways of covering a @xmath82 square with straight @xmath0-mers , and a lattice of size @xmath83 can be broken up into @xmath84 such small squares .",
    "in fact we can get a better bound on @xmath85 as follows : break the @xmath86 lattice in @xmath41 strips of width @xmath0 each . now if @xmath87 is the number of covering an @xmath88 rectangle with @xmath0-mers , we easily see that @xmath87 satisfy the recursion relation @xmath89 this implies that @xmath87 increases as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the largest root of the equation @xmath92 form this equation , it is easy to check that for large @xmath0 , @xmath93 the entropy per site is then bounded from below by @xmath94 and this gives the estimate @xmath95 for large @xmath0 .    for densities away from the fully packed state an approximate state of the system is obtained by first starting with a random configuration of the fully packed lattice , and then remove a fraction of the rods at random .",

    "clearly the disordered state has higher entropy for @xmath102 , but for lower densities , the nematic state is favored .",
    "it is easy to verify that the two curves cross at @xmath103 , for large k , where @xmath104 is some constant .",
    "hence we expect a second phase transition from the nematic ordered state to the disordered state as @xmath1 is increased beyond a density @xmath105 .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to study this second transition by our monte carlo simulations .",

    "these monomers occupy consecutive sites in the horizontal or vertical direction . if the @xmath0-mers are allowed to diffuse , equivalently the monomers can diffuse , but may remain bound together as a molecular bound state of @xmath0 monomers .",
    "however , at higher densities of such defects , these monomers become unbound . in the nematic state ,",
    "the monomers form a nearly ideal gas , and the larger entropy of the gas of monomers makes the nematic phase preferred thermodynamically . characterizing this phase transition , in particular to determine if it is first order or continuous is an interesting open problem ."
