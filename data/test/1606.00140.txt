    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are transient events that can be divided into two classes , short - duration ( @xmath1 2 s ) and long - duration ( @xmath2 2 s ) @xcite , or type i and ii grbs @xcite .",
    "the physical origins of the two classes are different : long grbs ( lgrbs ) are trigged by the collapse of low metallicity , massive star , and short grbs ( sgrbs ) are thought to be originated from mergers of compact binary systems , such as a black hole and a neutron star ( bh - ns ) , or two neutron stars ( ns - ns ) @xcite .",
    "the environments of the grb host galaxies provide important clues for understanding these energetic cosmic events , and have been under intensive study in the past two decades ( see , e.g. @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) . in general ,",
    "long - duration bursts are associated with star - forming galaxies @xcite that can be either faint or bright @xcite . on the other hand , the short - duration bursts typically have long - lived progenitors , and their host galaxies show a mixed population of early and late - type galaxies , with a wide span of star formation rates @xcite .",
    "up until grb  150101b , neither long or short - duration grb hosts show activities of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the center . due to the link between the long - duration bursts and the core - collapse of massive stars ,",
    "it was suspected that some grb hosts with bright sub - millimeter or infrared emission may be powered by agns ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several attempts have been made to identify agns in the grb hosts but yield no results @xcite . yet",
    ", it remains extremely interesting to explore the connection between grbs and the star - formation and agn activities of the host galaxies , as it may provide important clues about the roles of agn feedback , as well as the grb host environment .    in this letter",
    ", we present a multi - wavelength analysis of the host galaxy of grb 150101b .",
    "we confirm this host galaxy contains a central agn , which was first suggested by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . to date , it is the first confirmed agn in known grb host population .",
    "we also suggest that the host galaxy can be classified as an x - ray bright , optically normal galaxy ( xbong , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations and data analysis are presented in section  2 . in section  3",
    ", we fit the host sed and discuss the nature of the host galaxy and central agn .",
    "section  4 is discussion and summary . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt the standard @xmath3cdm cosmology with @xmath4=0.30 , @xmath5=0.70 , and h@xmath6=70 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "_ swift _  burst alert telescope ( bat ) was trigged by grb 150101b at 15:23 ut on 01 january 2015 .",
    "the light - curve shows a single peak with a duration ( t@xmath9 ) of 0.018 @xmath10 0.006 seconds @xcite .",
    "_ fermi _ was also triggered with a duration ( t@xmath9 ) of about 0.08 s ( 50 - 300 kev ) @xcite . at @xmath11",
    "away , the very large telescope ( vlt ) clearly detected the optical emission from the bright galaxy , 2masx j12320498 - 1056010 , which was identified as the host galaxy of grb  150101b @xcite .",
    "the vlt spectra show several prominent absorption features , most notably mg b and na d , at a redshift of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) also detected a faint , single emission line which they tentatively identified as an [ ] emission line at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , the gtc data suffered from poor weather condition , passing clouds , and bad seeing ( @xmath14 2.5@xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , we adopt z=0.134 as the redshift of the host galaxy in this work .",
    "this is one of the lowest redshifts among sgrb hosts @xcite .",
    "the estimated grb isotropic energy between 15 and 150 kev is 9.7 @xmath16 10@xmath17 erg at z = 0.134 .",
    "two _ chandra _  follow - up observations were performed at 7.8 days @xcite and 39 days @xcite after the burst , respectively . in figure  1 , the images taken by the two _ chandra _  observations show a bright and a fading source .",
    "the position of the fading x - ray counterpart is consistent with the only fading optical source in the bat position , reported by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray data reduction was performed with the chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software package ( version 4.6 ) .",
    "the spectra extracting region is shown in figure  1 in blue circles . for the x - ray fading counterpart ,",
    "the net count rates of the first and second epoch are ( 9.6 @xmath10 0.8 ) and ( 1.4 @xmath10 0.3 ) @xmath16 10@xmath18 cts / s , respectively .",
    "therefore , the fading x - ray source is identified as the grb afterglow .",
    "the position of the bright source is located in the nucleus of the known galaxy 2masx j12320498 - 1056010 , which was reported by several surveys and follow - up observations ( see , table  1 for photometry ) .",
    "adopting the images from the two chandra observations , the bright source coordinate is @xmath19 , and the fading source coordinate is @xmath20 , with a 90% uncertainty of 0.6 .",
    "the offset between two sources is @xmath21 2.77@xmath15 , and the projected physical offset is 6.61 kpc at z = 0.134 .",
    "about 35% sgrbs are located at more than 7 kpc away from the center of the host galaxies ( see , figure  10 in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the host light extends beyond the position of the grb optical afterglow @xcite . the possibility of such bright source coincidently appeared in the region of grb in a radius of 10  is less than 2.4 @xmath16 10@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the bright x - ray source is the nucleus of the host galaxy 2masx j12320498 - 1056010 .    to increase the photon statistics we merged the two observations of the bright source and extract its x - ray spectrum for modeling ( green regions in figure  1 ) .",
    "we used the xspec package v12.8.2 and adopted a model of power law with two photoelectric absorptions .",
    "one photoelectric absorption was fixed at the galactic value of @xmath23 , and one was let free at the redshift of the host galaxy .",
    "this simple model provides adequate fit to the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the fitted @xmath24 at the redshift of the host galaxy is @xmath25 , and the power law index is @xmath26 .",
    "we have derived a flux of 2.86 @xmath16 10@xmath27 erg @xmath28 s@xmath7 in 0.5 - 8.0 kev , and a luminosity of 1.37 @xmath16 10@xmath29 erg s@xmath7 in 0.5 - 8.0 kev .",
    "as we will discuss later in this paper , the source x - ray luminosity indicates it is a low luminosity agn , and this agn showed no variation during the two epochs ( 32 days ) .",
    "our flux is somewhat lower than that of @xcite , which may be attributed to the size of the source extraction region .",
    "note that the _ xmm_-newton  also have @xmath21 30 ks observation for this source after burst proposed by @xcite .",
    "but the grb and the central agn can not be spatial resolved .",

    "our multi - waveband analysis has confirmed the existence of the agn , which makes it the first grb host with reported agn . beside the clear detection of an x - ray point source in the center of the host galaxy ,",
    "we draw the conclusion based on the following findings .",
    "first , our sed fitting required an agn component ( green line in figure  2 ) .",
    "we have experimented the fit with a model without the agn component , and have found such fit officially unacceptable ( @xmath39 = 1.54 ) .",
    "the main problem with such model is that it can not fit the high flux presented in the uv band observed with _",
    "galex_.    secondly , the observed x - ray and mid - infrared luminosities are consistent with the intrinsic correlation among agns discovered by @xcite .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity between 2 and 10 kev is @xmath44 , and the predicted mid - infrared flux at 12 @xmath37 is between 0.3 and 4 mjy .",
    "this is consistent with the _ wise _  w3 data of 0.323 @xmath10 0.145 mjy , and suggests that the galaxy emission in mid - ir is dominated by the central agn .",
    "finally , the sed modeling also shows a synchrotron emission with a spectral slope of -0.62 @xmath10 0.03 in the radio band , suggesting agn - related activities .",
    "our sed fitting also suggest this is a radio - loud agn .",
    "conventionally , the radio loudness @xcite is defined as : @xmath45 using a b - band flux of 0.099 mjy from our sed model , we have found a radio - loudness of @xmath46 .",
    "both the radio loudness and the spectral index in the radio band suggest this agn is not a type - i agn .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the derived angle between equatorial axis and line of sight ( @xmath47 ) from the sed fitting .    very interestingly ,",
    "all the properties of the host galaxy of grb  150101b suggest it belongs to a special class of galaxies , namely the x - ray bright , optically normal galaxies , or xbongs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity of the host galaxy is consistent with those typical of xbongs in the range of @xmath48 .",
    "the observed x - ray to optical flux ratio of @xmath49 is also consistent those of xbongs ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "such flux ratio in general indicates some moderate level of agn activities .",
    "finally , the lack of optical emission features of those typical of agns is also consistent with the definition of xbongs .",
    "@xcite suggested three scenarios that may explain xbongs : agns with heavy obscuration , bl lac - like objects , or agns with radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf , @xcite ) . in the host galaxy of grb  150101b ,",
    "the observed low @xmath51 and moderate x - ray luminosity suggest the first two scenarios are unlikely . for the central agn we discussed here ,",
    "the observed optical - to - x - ray spectral index is @xmath52 ( 2500@xmath31 - 2 kev ) . adopting the m@xmath53-m@xmath54 relation in @xcite",

    "those values , as well as the radio - loudness , are consistent with the predictions of the riaf model @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the central agn of the host galaxy is dominated by riaf .",
    "in this paper we present multi - wavelength analysis of the host galaxy of grb 150101b . we have confirmed the host galaxy harbors an agn , based on : ( 1 ) the x - ray detection of a central point source with high x - ray luminosity ; ( 2 ) broadband sed modeling ; ( 3 ) the correlation between observed x - ray and mid - infrared luminosities ; and ( 4 ) the radio loudness and radio spectral index .",
    "we also found the host galaxy belongs to a special class of galaxies , the xbongs .",
    "the observed properties of this agn are consistent with being dominated by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow .",
    "grb 150101b is the first confirmed grb - agn system . up to date",
    "no agn was detected among lgrb hosts , and only one is reported among sgrb hosts ( this work ) .",
    "it is still unclear why the grb host galaxies show very little or no agn activities .",
    "agns are rare among galaxies , so one reason might simply be due to counting statistics .",
    "the fraction of high - ionization agn in local galaxies is about 2% ( the fraction of low - ionization agn is larger ) @xcite .",
    "this rate becomes higher at high redshift when agns activities peak between redshift 2 and 3 .",
    "up to date , redshift measurements have been reported for a total of @xmath57 grbs ; however , some of these measurements were performed on the grb afterglows and not on the host galaxies . adopting a conservative number of @xmath58 grb host galaxies from the ghosts sample",
    ", we would expect roughly 4 galaxies with agn activities if agn and grb are independent phenomena .",
    "so it probably is not entirely a surprise if we only observed one .",
    "future multi - wavelength study of the grb host galaxies should be able to resolve this issue .    on the other hand ,",
    "if agns do become less likely to be detected among the grb hosts , one possibility is that agn activities quench the star formation in the host galaxies , therefore reduce the likelihood of detecting lgrb events in such environment .",
    "however , since sgrb hosts typically show a wide span of stellar population ages , they clearly exhibit a link with the delayed star formation activities ( berger  2014 ) .",
    "therefore , it is likely to detect some level of agn activities among sgrb hosts . in particular",
    ", we have found the host galaxy of the grb  150101b belongs to xbongs , suggesting the direction of further study of the link between agn activities and grbs .",
