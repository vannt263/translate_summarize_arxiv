    "a measurement in quantum mechanics is a probabilistic process which , in the simplest situation , is described by the projection postulate  @xcite .",
    "conditional quantum measurements , however , can lead to results that can not be interpreted in terms of classical probabilities , due to the quantum correlations between measurements .",
    "an intriguing example for correlated quantum measurements outcome is the so called _ weak values _ ( wvs ) .",
    "it is the outcome of a measurement scheme originally developed by aharonov , albert and vaidman  @xcite .",
    "the weak value measurement protocol consists of ( i ) initializing the system in a certain state @xmath0 ( preselection ) , ( ii ) weakly measuring observable @xmath1 of the system , ( iii ) retaining the detector output only if the system is eventually measured to be in a chosen final state @xmath2 ( postselection ) .",
    "the average signal monitored by the detector will then be proportional to the real ( or imaginary ) part of the complex wv , @xmath3 .",
    "further discussion of the context in which wv should be understood has been provided  @xcite .",
    "going beyond the peculiarities of wv protocols , recent series of works explored the potential of wvs in quantum optics  @xcite and solid - state physics  @xcite , ranging from experimental observation to their application to hypersensitive measurements . in the latter , a measurement , performed by a detector _",
    "entangled _ with a system whose states can be preselected and postselected , leads to an amplified signal in the detector that enables sensing of small quantities  @xcite . quite generally within a wv - amplification protocol",
    ", only a subset of the detector s readings , associated with the tail of the signal s distribution , is accounted for .",
    "notwithstanding the scarcity of data points , the large value of @xmath4 , leads to an amplification  @xcite of the signal - to - external - noise ratio ( @xmath5 ) for systems where the noise is dominated by an external ( technical ) component .",
    "the amplification originating from wv protocols is non - universal .",
    "the specifics of such amplification are diverse and system - dependent .",
    "in fact , for statistical ( inherent ) noise , snr amplification resulting from large wvs is generally suppressed due to the reduction in the statistics of the collected data : postselection restricts us to a small subset of the readings at the detector .",
    "the upside of the wv procedure has several facets : if we try to enhance the statistics by increasing the intensity of input signal through the system ( e.g. , intensity of the impinging photon beam ) , possibly entering a non - linear response regime , postselection will effectively reduce this intensity back to a level accessible to the detector sensitivity  @xcite . alternatively , amplification may originate from the imaginary component of the weak value  @xcite , or from the different effect of the noise and the measured variable on the detector s signal  @xcite .",
    "however , as long as quantum fluctuations ( leading to inherent statistical noise ) dominate , the large wv is outweighed by the scarcity of data points , failing to amplify the signal - to - statistical - noise ratio  @xcite .",
    "we have recently presented an alternative measurement protocol dubbed _ null weak value _ ( nwv ) , that leads to high fidelity discrimination between qubit states on the background of _ quantum fluctuations _",
    "the main features of this protocol are ( i ) it is distinctly different from the standard wv in making use of a partial - collapse measurement  a strong measurement that occurs with a small probability realized by finely tuned , time resolved coupling to the detector  , in which the system experiences weak backaction only for a subset of all possible measurement outcomes ( see e.g.  , refs .  @xcite ; ( ii ) unlike standard wv - amplification procedures  @xcite , where one needs to employ two degrees of freedom ( related , respectively , to `` system '' and `` detector '' ) which are entangled by the weak measurement , in nwvs there is a single quantum degree of freedom ( `` system '' ) since the detector is classical ; ( iii ) the snr amplification is versus inherent quantum and statistical fluctuations , and not only against external detector noise .    here",
    "we present a general formalism for nwvs .",
    "after briefly reviewing the derivation of standard - wv ( section  [ standard ] ) , in section  [ multi ] we generalize the definition of a nwv to a multi - level system .",
    "the main results are summarized in the section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "weak values describe the outcome read in a detector when the measured system is subsequently found to be in a specific state .",
    "the weak coupling between a system and a detector is performed by an ideal von neumann measurement  @xcite , described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian of the system ( detector ) , and @xmath8 is the interaction hamiltonian between the two . here",
    "@xmath9 is the momentum canonically conjugate to the position of the detector s pointer , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is a time dependent coupling constant .",
    "@xmath13 is the measured observable .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the free hamiltonians of the system and the detector vanish and that @xmath14 .",
    "the system is initially prepared in the state @xmath15 , and the detector in the state @xmath16 .",
    "the latter is assumed to be a gaussian wave - packet centered at @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "after the interaction with the detector the entangled state of the two is @xmath19 in a regular measurement the signal in the detector , i.e. the pointer s position @xmath20 , is read . from the classical signal , @xmath21 , one can infer the average value of the observable @xmath1 .    in a weak value protocol the signal in the detector is kept provided that the system is successfully postselected to be in a state @xmath22 .",
    "hence , the detector ends up in the state @xmath23 \\hat{p}{\\left|{\\phi_0}\\right>}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx e^{-i \\lambda { } _ f\\langle\\hat{a}\\rangle_i } \\hat{p }   { \\left|{\\phi_0}\\right > } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ]",
    "] that corresponds to a shift in the position of the pointer proportional to @xmath24 $ ] . hence the expectation value of the coordinate of the pointer is given by @xmath25\\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath26 here , too , the conditional average value of @xmath1 is inferred from the detector s reading .",
    "we note that the approximation in eq .",
    "[ spostamento ] is valid when @xmath27 .",
    "this means that the initial detector s wave function and the shifted one due to the interaction with the system are strongly overlapping . in turn",
    ", this means that for _ any _ outcome of the detector the state of the system is weakly changed .",
    "this corresponds to a weak measurement .",
    "as long as the measurement of the observable , @xmath1 , is weak , the weak value is a general result and does not depend on the details of the coupling or the specific choice of the detector .",
    "a different measurement protocol based on a postselected readout has been recently proposed as an efficient tool for qubit state discrimination  @xcite .",
    "the nwv protocol consists , like the standard - wv protocol , of a two - step procedure .",
    "consider first a two - level system .",
    "it is initially prepared in a state @xmath15 .",
    "the first measurement , @xmath28 , is a strong ( projective ) measurement which is performed on the system with small probability @xmath29 .",
    "specifically , during the time of this measurement we allow the system to decay , thus inducing a signal in the detector .",
    "the detector then `` clicks '' ( the measurement outcome is positive ) and the qubit system is destroyed .",
    "very importantly , having a `` null outcome '' ( no click ) still results in a weak backaction on the system .",
    "we refer to this stage of the measurement process as `` weak partial - collapse '' .",
    "subsequently the qubit state is ( strongly ) measured a second time ( postselected ) , @xmath30 , to be in the state @xmath22 ( click ) , @xmath31 ( no click ) .",
    "the conditional probability of [ a `` click '' in the weak partial - collapse measurement conditional to `` no click '' in the postselection ] , @xmath32 , defines the nwv with @xmath33 and @xmath34 representing `` click '' and `` no click '' , respectively .",
    "events in which the qubit is measured strongly ( in the second measurement ) , @xmath30 , are discarded .",
    "this protocol substantially differs from the standard - wv in the employment of the weak partial - collapse measurement . as long as a single measurement",
    "is concerned , the partial - collapse measurement will give the same results as a standard von neumann measurement . however , in the nwv protocol , involving a postselection leads to results which are qualitatively different as compared with the application of a standard wv protocol .",
    "in fact the nwv protocol allows to discriminate between two possible initial qubit states , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , via repeating the protocol for both cases and comparing the respective conditional outcomes , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . defining the signal @xmath39 ,",
    "it has been shown that the nwv protocol can be used to discriminate between the two states with an amplified snr as compared with a standard measurement of a single observable .",
    "we present here a general formalism for nwvs of a multi - level system . for the sake of being pedagogical ,",
    "let us think of a single quantum particle in a closed system .",
    "the single - particle states span an @xmath40-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the system is initially prepared in a state @xmath41 , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "our protocol is comprised of two consecutive measurements ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the first measurement is a weak partial - collapse measurement .",
    "one can think of a partial - collapse measurement as coupling the system to a continuum of states ( the `` detector '' ) through a tunnel barrier .",
    "tunneling is allowed for a time window @xmath44 , effectively enabling the states @xmath45 to tunnel out of the system with probability @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the corresponding tunneling rate for @xmath48 .",
    "the information on whether the particle is found out of the system can be studied and defines the detector s signal .",
    "hence , the average outcome of the partial - collapse measurement would result in the measurement of the observable @xmath49 note that this observable depends on the tunneling probabilities and is therefore not a pure observable of the system .",
    "there are several situations where a calibration of this measurement leads to an observable of the system only .",
    "for example , if the tunneling probability of a specific state , @xmath45 is much larger than that of the other states ( @xmath50 for any @xmath51 ) we can measure the population of this state @xmath52 .",
    "another example of such a calibration is for a case where ( without loss of generality ) the states @xmath53 , @xmath54 , tunnel out with probability @xmath29 and the other states @xmath53 , @xmath55 , tunnel out with probability @xmath56 . here",
    ", the population of the subspace @xmath57 is obtained .",
    "having in mind these cases we define , for the sake of brevity , the operator of the system @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a calibration function that translates the probabilistic outcome of the partial - collapse procedure ( characterized by @xmath60 ) to an observable of the system .    in order to include postselection , we assume that subsequently to the tunneling ( measurement of the `` system '' by the `` detector '' ) the system undergoes a general unitary evolution , @xmath61 .",
    "finally the state of the particle is ( strongly ) measured a second time ( postselected ) to be , for example , in state @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "one may now define an expectation value of the operator @xmath1 , conditioned on the reading of the second measurement being negative ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the conditional probability of having a click in the first measurement conditional to _ not _ having a click the second time .",
    "this is the nwv .",
    "note that , in similitude to a standard - wv  @xcite , @xmath67 may give rise to large values , beyond the interval [ 0,1 ] .    to shed some light on this expression",
    "we calculate explicitly the conditional probabilities following the measurement procedure sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . as a first step",
    ", we note that when the detector clicks during the first measurement ( positive outcome of the detector ) the state of the system is destroyed .",
    "very importantly , having a `` null outcome '' ( no click ) still results in a weak backaction ( partial collapse ) on the system .",
    "in such a case the state can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the probability of the state to be positively measured .",
    "we include general relative phases that such a coupling could induce in the form of @xmath70 .     a tree diagram of the state evolution under subsequent partial - collapse measurements ;",
    "the respective probabilities are indicated : @xmath71 [ @xmath72 is the probability that the detector `` clicks '' [ no `` click '' ] upon the first measurement . if it does `` click '' , the system is destroyed , hence there are no clicks upon further measurements [ this is marked by a ( red ) @xmath73 .",
    "note that following @xmath74 ( null detection of the system ) , the weak backaction rotates @xmath75 into @xmath76 and then , upon further evolution , into @xmath77 . ]    rewriting the conditional probability on the right - hand - side of eq .   using bayes theorem",
    ", we obtain @xmath78 the conditional probability @xmath79 represents classical correlation between the two measurements , namely , given that the detector has clicked in the first measurement ( the particle has tunneled out to the detector ) , the result of the second measurement will be negative with probability @xmath80 .",
    "by contrast , @xmath81 embeds non - trivial quantum correlations . if no tunneling takes place [ with probability @xmath82 the state evolves into @xmath83 of eq .  .",
    "during the time @xmath84 between the two measurements , the state is evolved in a controlled fashion to @xmath85 .",
    "if the state was measured in the first measurement , this evolution is truncated .",
    "the second strong measurement , @xmath30 gives a positive outcome ( `` click '' of the detector ) with probability @xmath86 and a negative one with @xmath87 .",
    "collecting this into eq .  , we obtain @xmath88 and after calibration the nwv of eq .",
    "can be written as @xmath89    an interesting case is that of a two - level systems , where only two tunneling probabilities exist and the nwv protocol uniquely defines the measured observable @xmath90 , i.e.  the population of the state @xmath91 .",
    "the postselection is arbitrarily chosen to consist of a projection on the state @xmath91 . taking a weak partial - collapse limit @xmath92 such that @xmath93 , eq .   yields @xmath94 where we have defined the final state to include a general rotation between the partial - collapse measurement and the postselection , @xmath95 .",
    "the expression for the nwv result in eq .   is indeed different from the standard - wv expression [ see eq .  ] .",
    "this is a manifestation of the partial - collapse measurement , to be contrasted with a von - neumann type  @xcite weak measurement underlying the latter .",
    "the differences between the two values are shown in fig  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "it appears that the nwv diverges with a wider envelope than the standard - wv as the pre- and postselection states become more orthogonal .     the real part of the standard - wv ( dashed green line ) and the nwv ( dotted blue line ) of the observable @xmath96 of a qubit vs.  the postselection angle .",
    "the initial state is arbitrarily chosen to be @xmath97 .",
    "the postselection angle , determined by the the rotation @xmath98 , is defined by @xmath99 .",
    "the protocol is readily generalized to include characterization of the state by both tangential and azimuthal angles . ]",
    "we have presented here a novel measurement protocol , applicable to a general system spanning an @xmath40-dimensional hilbert space . similar to standard weak values , the outcome of this protocol ",
    "null weak value  is the result of a first ( weaker ) measurement correlated with a strong postselection .",
    "ostensibly , as long as a single measurement is concerned , the first measurement in both protocols yields the same outcome .",
    "however , the substantial difference between the standard- and null- weak values comes to show that its backaction on the system is profoundly different .",
    "hence , involving a postselection leads to qualitatively different correlated results .",
