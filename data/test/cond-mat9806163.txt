    "non - equilibrium kinetics of diffusion - limited reactions has been the subject of much recent interest @xcite .",
    "in contrast to equilibrium systems  which are best analyzed with standard thermodynamics  or reaction - limited processes  whose kinetics is well described by classical rate equations @xcite  there is no general approach to non - equilibrium , diffusion - limited reactions .    in this paper",
    "we study a diffusion - limited coalescence process in one dimension : @xmath0 , which yields itself to _ exact _ analysis .",
    "we show that a solution is possible even in the presence of background drift , and in the presence of a trap ; when in the long - time asymptotic limit the stationary state of the system is a _",
    "nonequilibrium _ state .",
    "the drift field controls an interesting phase transition in the steady state of the system : the size of the depletion zone next to the trap increases as a function of the drift away from the trap . beyond a certain critical drift strength ,",
    "the only possible stationary state is the vacuum ( an empty lattice , with no particles ) .    our analysis of the steady state yields the surprising result that the distance between a given particle and the nearest particle to its right ( the  forward \" ipdf ) is exactly the same as in equilibrium , even in the presence of a trap , and independently of the drift !",
    "we suggest that this is due to a  shielding \" effect : the particle nearest to the trap shields the rest of the particles from the effect of the trap .",
    "the trap and the drift influence only the distance between the trap and the nearest particle to the trap  all other particles remain unaffected .",
    "finally , we use the coalescence model with a trap to study the applicability of reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "reaction - diffusion equations are the most common approximation method in the study of diffusion - limited processes .",
    "our system is a rare example where ( in the absence of drift ) the stationary solution of the relevant reaction - diffusion equation may be found in closed form .",
    "we explore in what ways the reaction - diffusion equation is approximate , by comparing its results to the exact solution of the ipdf method .",
    "the comparison also allows us to determine the optimal rate constants of the reaction - diffusion equation in a straightforward manner .",
    "normally , this feat requires a renormalization group analysis .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : formulation ] we present a lattice model of diffusion - limited reversible coalescence , along with the exact method of analysis ; the method of empty intervals , also known as the method of inter - particle distribution functions ( ipdf ) .",
    "the stationary _ equilibrium _ state in a homogeneous infinite system , needed for comparison with the trap , is analyzed and summarized in section  [ sec : homogeneous ] . in section  [ sec : trap ] , a trap is introduced and the resulting stationary state is explored . the exact solution includes a description of the dynamical phase transition in the stationary kinetics of the system , brought about by the background drift .",
    "the explanation to the surprising result that the ipdf of the system with a trap is homogeneous ( and exactly the same as in equilibrium ) is presented in section  [ sec : shielding ] .",
    "last , in section  [ sec : mean - field ] we compare the exact solution for the case of non - biased diffusion ( zero drift ) to that of the corresponding reaction - diffusion equation .",
    "our goal is to show in what ways the latter is an approximation , and to devise strategies to find out appropriate rate coefficients . we conclude with a discussion and open questions in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our model @xcite is defined on a one - dimensional lattice of lattice spacing @xmath1 .",
    "each site is in one of two states : occupied by a particle @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , or empty ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "particles hop randomly to the nearest neighbor site on their right ( left ) , at rate @xmath5  @xmath6 .",
    "thus , in the continuum limit of @xmath7 , the particles undergo diffusion with a diffusion constant @xmath8 , and with a uniform background drift velocity @xmath9",
    ". a particle may give birth to an additional particle , into a nearest neighbor site , at rate @xmath10 ( on either side of the particle ) @xcite . if hopping or birth occurs into a site which is already occupied , the target site remains occupied .",
    "the last rule means that coalescence , @xmath11 , takes place _ immediately _ upon encounter of any two particles .",
    "thus , the system models the diffusion - limited reaction process @xmath12 the dynamical rules of the model are illustrated in fig .  1 .    .",
    "reaction rules : ( a ) diffusion ; ( b ) birth ; and coalescence , ( c ) following diffusion , and ( d ) following a birth event .",
    "the dotted lines in ( a ) and ( b ) indicate alternative target sites . in ( a ) , the rate of the two possibilities differ due to the drift . [",
    "fig : rules ]    an exact treatment of the problem is possible through the method of empty intervals , known also as the method of inter - particle distribution functions ( ipdf ) .",

    "this is to be expected because all the microscopic rules involved are reversible .",

    "another trivial solution is the  vacuum \" state ; @xmath69 .",
    "it represents a completely empty system .",
    "but the solution  ( [ e_eq ] ) is stable , while the vacuum state is not .",
    "in fact , when the initial state of the system is a mixture of the two phases : @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for @xmath73 , say , then the stable phase invades the unstable phase . in the absence of drift ,",
    "the front between the two phases propagates at the constant speed @xmath74 ( the birth rate ) @xcite .",
    "this system has been studied as a  noisy \" analogue of the mean - field problem of fisher waves @xcite . here",
    "we wish to study another inhomogeneous situation , where there is a perfectly absorbing trap at the origin , instead of the initial empty half - space .",
    "as opposed to the fisher problem , in the case of a trap the system arrives at a stationary state .",
    "this state must be a non - equilibrium state , because the trap is irreversible ( particles trapped in ca nt ever come out ) .",
    "as the trap depletes its immediate neighborhood , the depletion zone is continually replenished by a stream of particles from the stable phase which rush in at speed @xmath74 , as in the fisher wave problem .",
    "suppose now that the particles are subject to a drift @xmath9 away from the trap , then an interesting transition would take place as @xmath9 is made larger than @xmath74 : the depletion zone would grow faster than it could be replenished , and the stationary state would never be achieved !",
    "we wish to study this transition , and how the depletion zone is affected by the drift when @xmath75 .    to derive the appropriate boundary condition , we turn back to the discrete representation . in the presence of a perfect trap at @xmath76 , eq .",
    "( [ mastereq ] ) is limited to @xmath77 .",
    "the special equation for @xmath76 is @xmath78 comparison to eq .",
    "( [ mastereq ] ) yields the discrete boundary condition @xmath79 which in the continuum limit becomes @xmath80 in addition , the boundary condition  ( [ bc0 ] ) is now replaced by @xmath81    we are looking then for the solution to eq .",

    "assume @xmath83 , then @xmath84 and @xmath85 satisfy the odes : @xmath86 we find the solution by inspection :",
    "a good guess is that @xmath87 would be part of it , since far away from the trap one expects convergence to the equilibrium state .",
    "however , @xmath88 fails to satisfy the boundary condition due to the trap , eq .",
    "( [ bctrap ] ) . looking for the simplest possible way to mend this and to satisfy the remaining boundary conditions , we find that it is sufficient to consider just one additional component : @xmath89 .",
    "the final solution turns out to be @xmath90 far away from the trap , as @xmath91 , this converges to the equilibrium result of eq .",

    "the backward ipdf is @xmath101 notice this time the dependence on the position of the given particle , @xmath45 , as well as the dependence on the drift , and that the backward and forward ipdfs are _ not _ equal .",
    "moreover , the backward ipdf does not normalize properly .",
    "the reason for that is that there is a finite chance that there are no particles between the particle at @xmath45 and the trap ; _ i.e. _ , the particle at @xmath45 might be the nearest particle to the trap .",
    "the probability density for the distance of the nearest particle to the trap can be computed from the continuum limit of eq .",

    "the depletion zone shrinks as the drift s strength increases , and it vanishes in the limit of infinite drift .",
    "at first sight there seems to be a contradiction between the forward ipdf ( eq .  [ ps ] ) and the concentration profile ( eq .  [ cs ] ) .",
    "how could it be that the distribution of distances between nearest particles is independent of location , while particles are sparser near the trap ! ?",
    "the answer is that the forward ipdf is a _ conditional _ probability ",
    "dependent on the presence of the first particle at @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the unexpectedly small distance between particles in a sparse region is compensated by the rare likelihood of finding such pairs of nearest particles in the first place !",
    "nevertheless , one ca nt help wondering what kind of distribution would explain the results of the previous section .",
    "the answer turns out to be surprisingly simple .",
    "suppose that the particles to the right of the trap are distributed just as in equilibrium , with the exception of the nearest particle to the trap .",
    "assume further that the nearest particle to the trap is at distance @xmath106 , with probability @xmath107 ( the same probability density as in eq .",
    "[ p0 ] ) . in this view , the effect of the trap is merely to create an empty gap between itself and the first particle  a gap which increases as the drift @xmath9 approaches the critical value @xmath74 .",
    "[ it follows from eq .",
    "( [ p0 ] ) that the average distance to the first particle is @xmath108 . ]",
    "another way of looking at the suggested distribution is as if the nearest particle to the trap _ shields _ all the other particles from the effects of the trap ! the proposed distribution is illustrated in fig .",
    "we now show that this model reproduces the results of section  [ sec : trap ] .",
    "all we need to do is to derive the empty interval probability @xmath109 implied by the model , since everything else follows from it .",
    "@xmath109 can attain one of three values  depending on the location of the endpoints of the @xmath110 interval relative to the location of the nearest particle to the trap ,",
    "@xmath106 : @xmath111 therefore , @xmath112 the result is exactly as @xmath113 of eq .",
    "( [ es.drift ] ) !    .",
    "schematic illustration of the shielding effect : the particles in the shaded area are distributed randomly and independently from each other , as in equilibrium .",
    "the gap @xmath106 between the particles and the trap follows the probability density distribution @xmath107 .",
    "so far , we have merely demonstrated that  shielding \" is _ consistent _ with the exact results .",
    "a complete proof requires showing that the full hierarchy of @xmath16-point density - density correlation functions are the same as postulated by the shielding model .",
    "the problem of @xmath16-point correlation functions can be formulated exactly within the framework of the ipdf method @xcite . with this method ,",
    "it is rather straightforward to prove the shielding effect  @xcite .",
    "reaction - diffusion equations are one of the most valuable and widely used approaches to kinetics of reaction processes .",
    "the method posits the existence of a _",
    "mesoscopic _ length scale within which the system is homogeneous and well mixed , and where the reaction rates can be accounted for as in classical rate equations . at longer length scales , variations in the concentration , @xmath114 , give rise to diffusion , which is modeled by a simple diffusion term .",
    "for example , the reaction - diffusion equation that applies to our model , in the absence of drift , is @xmath115 together with the boundary condition : @xmath116 which is imposed by the trap at the origin .",
    "@xmath117 is the effective diffusion constant , and @xmath118 and @xmath119 represent the effective rates of birth and coalescence of particles , respectively .    in spite of the popularity of reaction - diffusion equations it is not often appreciated that they are mere idealizations , yielding only approximate results .",
    "the reason for this misconception is twofold : ( 1 ) few exact solutions of reaction - diffusion models are available for comparison , and ( 2 ) the reaction - diffusion equations themselves are usually complicated enough that they can not be solved in closed form , and so their consequences are not always clear .",
    "diffusion - limited coalescence with a trap is a rare example where the stationary state is known exactly , and where also the corresponding reaction - diffusion equation may be solved exactly , at least in the case of zero drift @xcite .",
    "we wish to compare the two solutions .",
    "the exact steady state for zero drift , needed for the comparison , may be obtained from the results of section  [ sec : trap ] . taking the limit @xmath120 in eqs .",
    "( [ es.drift ] ) and ( [ cs ] ) , we find @xmath121 and @xmath122    regarding the reaction - diffusion equation , eq .",
    "( [ reac - diff ] ) , our first concern is to identify the constants @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "we note first that @xmath123 since in the absence of reactions ( when @xmath124 ) the particles perform simple diffusion , characterized by the diffusion constant @xmath8the same @xmath8 as in the hopping rate @xmath125 of the microscopic rules . furthermore ,",
    "in the continuum limit the model s only physical parameters relevant to its kinetics are the diffusion constant @xmath8 ( of dimension @xmath126 ; @xmath127 , and @xmath128 ) and the birth rate @xmath74 ( dimension @xmath129 )",
    ". therefore , the only way to produce the required dimensions of @xmath118 ( @xmath130 ) and @xmath119 ( @xmath129 ) is by having @xmath131 and @xmath132 . finally , consider the stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ reac - diff ] ) in an infinite system without the trap : @xmath133 . to conform with the exact solution of  ( [ ceq ] ) we must have @xmath134 .",

    "we have solved the one - dimensional problem of diffusion - limited reversible coalescence with a trap , and with a background drift , exactly .",
    "the system exhibits a dynamical phase transition in its long - time asymptotic steady state , which is controlled by the strength of the drift away from the trap .",
    "as the drift increases the depletion zone near the trap grows larger , until when the drift crosses a critical threshold and the depletion zone becomes infinitely wide ; the system is then empty .",
    "a very intriguing prediction of the exact solution is the distribution of distances between any given particle and its nearest neighbor to the right ( the forward ipdf ) , which turns out to be exactly the same as in equilibrium  as in the system without the trap  and independent of the drift !",
    "this is explained by a  shielding \" effect : the nearest particle to the trap effectively shields the rest of the particles from the trap s influence .",
    "the trap and background drift affect only the width of the gap between the trap and the nearest particle .",
    "we have also contrasted the exact solution , in the absence of drift , with the alternative , traditional approach of reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "our model is a non - trivial example where both the true kinetics , as well as the solution to the model s reaction - diffusion equation , are known exactly . comparing the two solutions we were able to relate the effective rates of the reaction - diffusion equation to the microscopic rates of the underlying process , without appealing to renormalization group techniques .",
