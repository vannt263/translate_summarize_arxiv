    "ever since the foundation of modern cosmology based on general relativity , there have been attempts to determine the cosmological parameters of our universe .",
    "gravitational lensing has been recognized as one of several such tools .",
    "for example , the results of radio surveys for gravitational lenses have recently been used to place significant constraints on cosmological models ( falco et al .",
    "it has also been realised that observations of supernovae at high redshift can be used for this purpose ( goobar & perlmutter @xcite ) , in particular for determining the value of the cosmological constant .",
    "in fact , several collaborations with this in mind are in progress , and the first sets of data show an intriguing hint of a non - vanishing cosmological constant in a universe consistent with having a flat geometry ( see , e.g. , riess et al .",
    "@xcite ; perlmutter et al .",
    "although the two groups which have published results mutually agree on the best - fit parameters , it is important to note that the effects of geometry are small ( on the order of half a magnitude ) , and the need to go to even higher redshift to get larger effects is obvious .",
    "when observing such distant sources , at redshift greater than unity , it is necessary to estimate the effects of lensing due to inhomogeneities in the matter distribution .",
    "this will be of growing importance when supernovae at very high redshifts become accessible , e.g. , with ngst , the next generation space telescope ( miralda - escud & rees @xcite ; dahln & fransson @xcite ) or with the dedicated supernova search satellite , snap ( perlmutter et al .",
    ", private communication ) .",
    "the literature on gravitational lensing is quite rich .",
    "much of the history and developments up to the early 1990s can be found in the excellent textbook by schneider , ehlers & falco ( @xcite ) . a new method for examining lensing effects",
    "has recently been proposed by holz & wald ( @xcite ; hw ) , one which has the virtue of lending itself easily to numerical calculations . in that work",
    "it is also shown that given a large and deep enough sample of standard candle supernovae , one may in principle distinguish between different matter distributions in the galactic halos responsible for the lensing . in particular the case of point masses gives a quite different distribution of magnifications ( or de - magnifications ) compared to the case of singular isothermal spheres ( see also metcalf & silk @xcite ) .",
    "the method of hw can be summarized as follows : first , a friedmann - lematre ( fl ) background geometry is selected .",
    "inhomogeneities are accounted for by specifying a matter distribution in cells which have an average energy density equal to that of the underlying fl model .",
    "following the history of observed light from a distant source , a light ray is traced backwards to the desired redshift by being sent through a series of cells , each time with a randomly selected impact parameter with respect to the matter distribution in the cell . between each cell ,",
    "the fl background is used to update the scale factor and the expansion rate . by using monte carlo techniques to trace a large number of such light rays , statistics for the apparent luminosity of an ensemble of sources at a given redshift",
    "is obtained .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize the method of hw in a number of ways and to investigate some issues related to the different lensing signatures in the luminosity distribution of supernovae caused by different mass distributions of the intervening lens population .",
    "the outline is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : cosmodel ] it is demonstrated how the hw method can be generalized from matter in dust form to perfect fluids with pressure .",
    "[ sec : area ] is concerned with the interpretation of results as probability distributions .",
    "[ sec : devi ] presents the geodesic deviation and in sect .",
    "[ sec : hwsummary ] , we summarize and discuss some of the conceptual issues in the analysis of hw . in sect .",
    "[ sec : nfw ] , we include the possibility of using the more realistic halo matter distribution proposed by navarro et al .",
    "( @xcite ; nfw ) based on their n - body simulation results , and in sect .",
    "[ sec : massdist ] we discuss the mass distribution of lensing galaxies . by using realistic density profiles and mass distributions of dark matter halos ,",
    "we can obtain high accuracy results on gravitational lensing without the need of using the extensive full data sets of n - body simulations , as in some other methods ( wambsganss et al .",
    "@xcite ; premadi et al .",
    "@xcite ; jain et al .",
    "one strength of our ray - tracing monte carlo method is further that it can be continuously refined as more observational information , e.g. , on galaxy distributions is obtained .",
    "also , effects such as absorption by dust and other possibly @xmath0-dependent effects can be straightforwardly added to the algorithm . in sect .",

    "the starting point of hw is a newtonianly perturbed fl universe .",
    "the line element of robertson - walker form is then @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the scale factor , and @xmath3 is a constant - curvature three - geometry , for which @xmath4 indicates the sign of the curvature .",
    "( we use geometrized units such that @xmath5 ) .",
    "the perturbation @xmath6 is assumed to satisfy a number of properties that will be employed when determining dominant terms .",
    "firstly , @xmath7 , reflecting that @xmath6 indeed is a perturbation .",
    "secondly , inhomogeneities are assumed to be significant , so that @xmath8 is small compared to spatial derivatives .",
    "thirdly , second - order spatial derivatives will be assumed to dominate over products of first - order ones ( e.g. , @xmath9 ) . in this paper , we have generalized the treatment of hw so that the matter content of the model can be taken to be a number of perfect fluids : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the stress - energy tensor , @xmath12 is the energy density , @xmath13 the pressure of fluid @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the ( normalized ) fluid four - velocity , and @xmath16 is the metric corresponding to the line element ( [ eq : line - element ] ) .",
    "cosmologically reasonable equations of state are linear barotropic ones : @xmath17 . in this paper ,",
    "the @xmath18 s are constants with @xmath19 .",
    "however , it is straightforward to allow for the equations of state to evolve with redshift , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "hw considered dust models with a cosmological constant , which corresponds to a two - fluid model , the first fluid having @xmath21 , and the second fluid homogeneously distributed with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the field equations , corresponding to eqs .",

    "] @xmath27 have been made explicit , and where @xmath28 denotes the spatial projection of contracted covariant derivatives .",
    "the pressure does not enter the friedmann equation , i.e. , the hubble scalar is entirely given by the energy densities and the curvature .",
    "the deceleration , on the other hand , is affected by the presence of pressure . comparing the above field equations with the field equations for the corresponding fl background ( with averaged densities and pressures @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) it can be shown [ eq .  ( hw11 ) ] that @xmath6 satisfies a poisson equation @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , while @xmath33 vanishes .",
    "thus , the pressures result in homogeneous contributions , and the specification of an equation of state only makes sense in terms of the averaged energy density : @xmath34 .    from the field equations for the background model",
    "follows + _ the energy conservation equation : _",
    "@xmath35 if the fluids are assumed to couple only to gravity , they will be separately conserved , and each component in the sum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ec ] ) vanishes .",
    "note that it is only for dust ( @xmath36 ) that the mass within a volume co - moving with the hubble flow is constant ( @xmath37 ) . for other types of matter",
    ", the mass varies with time because of the work done by the pressure .",
    "also note that @xmath38 results in a constant energy density .",
    "thus , a homogeneously distributed fluid with @xmath38 is equivalent to a cosmological constant , or in terms of quantum field models , to vacuum energy .",
    "it is convenient to introduce density parameters @xmath39 which depend on time and therefore on redshift . assuming the above discussed equations of state the time dependence is governed by the following set of conservation equations ( see , e.g. , goliath & ellis @xcite ) @xmath40\\omega_ih .\\ ] ]    hw proceed by performing a number of coordinate transformations to co - moving coordinates on isotropic form , eq .",
    "the inclusion of pressure results in a modification of this line element : @xmath41    dt^2 \\nonumber \\\\    & + & \\left[1 - 2\\phi\\right](dx^2+dy^2+dz^2 ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , and the effective potential @xmath43 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath44    the lookback time of an event at redshift @xmath45 is the time difference ( with respect to the coordinate @xmath46 ) between the event and the present . by using @xmath47 , we get a relation between the lookback time and the redshift for a fl universe : @xmath48 to obtain @xmath49 , the friedmann equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fe ] ) , is expressed in terms of redshift and the present densities @xmath50 .",
    "to do so , first note that the energy conservation equation , eq .",

    "consider a narrow ( strictly speaking ; infinitesimal ) ray bundle connecting a source and an observer as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing ] .",
    "the ray bundle can be focused either at the source or the observer .",
    "the relevant quantity when determining luminosity distances is the ratio of the area of a beam and the solid angle it subtends .",
    "of course , the smaller the distance , the brighter the source .    in the method of hw ,",
    "a beam focused at the observer with infinitesimal @xmath57 is integrated backwards using the geodesic deviation equation , and the resulting area at the source sphere is considered . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing ] , the beam has undergone additional focusing .",
    "a finite aperture at the observer will detect light from a larger @xmath57 of an isotropically emitting source , and a finite source will subtend a larger solid angle on the sky . since surface brightness is conserved , the source will be magnified .",
    "the magnification , @xmath58 , is defined as the ratio of the _ observed _ flux and the flux of the corresponding image in absence of any additional focusing .",
    "@xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the solid angle subtended by the source in absence of lenses .",
    "hence the magnification will be proportional to the inverse of the area of the beam . in absence of any lenses",
    ", the ray bundle will have an area corresponding to the so called _ empty - beam _ area ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : devi ] ) , and we will therefore define the magnification as @xmath61 for further reference , see schneider , ehlers & falco ( @xcite ) .    as noted in hw ,",
    "some care is needed when interpreting results as probability distributions .",
    "this is due to the fact that individual ray bundles do not correspond to random source positions .",
    "this is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing3 ] where we consider the situation of a ray bundle originating from an observer at @xmath62 at the center of a source sphere at some fixed redshift .    from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing3 ] we see that focused beams sample a smaller fraction of the source sphere .",
    "since the fraction of the source sphere being sampled by a beam is proportional to the area of the beam , i.e. , inversely proportional to the magnification , magnified sources will be overrepresented if not compensated for . in hw",
    ", this is done by convoluting the obtained probability distribution , @xmath63 , with a factor proportional to @xmath64 , thus obtaining a new distribution @xmath65 .",
    "the method we use is very similar in that we designate a probability , proportional to the area of the ray bundle , to keep every event .",
    "the advantage of this rejection method is that each selected event represents a statistically `` real '' event .",
    "further discussions of the statistical weight given to random line - of - sights can be found in ehlers & schneider ( @xcite ) .",
    "the geodesic deviation equation for a light ray is ( see , e.g. , wald @xcite ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the deviation vector and @xmath68 is a null vector tangent to the light ray .",
    "the affine parameter @xmath69 is a parametrization along the light ray given by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the frequency of the photons in the beam .",
    "it is instructive to calculate the deviation in an exact ( homogeneous ) fl universe , analogous to eq .",
    "( hw21 ) : @xmath72 thus , the pressure will cause additional focusing of the light beam . note that a cosmological constant , which corresponds to @xmath38 , does not affect the deviation .    to derive the deviation experienced when propagating through a cell in the inhomogeneous model , hw start by writing the deviation equation in terms of a @xmath73 matrix @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 where @xmath76 ( hw28 ) .",
    "the properties of the geodesic deviation are contained in @xmath74 .",
    "for example , the area ( with orientation ) of the beam is given by @xmath77 .",
    "in the case of the homogeneous background friedmann - lematre cosmology , we denote the corresponding reference area @xmath78 , which will of course depend on the redshift , but also on the cosmological parameters of the fl background model . also , the area of a light beam that propagates without encountering any matter will be denoted @xmath79 .",
    "sometimes @xmath78 and @xmath79 are referred to as the _ filled - beam _ and _ empty - beam _ areas , respectively .    the deviation equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : devia ] ) , can now be written as a set of difference equations ( hw35,36 ) @xmath80 with @xmath81 where the integration is along a straight line through the cell .",
    "next , @xmath82 is calculated from the line element eq .",
    "( [ eq : lineco ] ) @xmath83        \\!\\eta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\!\\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the minkowski metric associated with the coordinates @xmath85 .",
    "thus , with non - vanishing pressure , there will be an additional contribution in @xmath86 that takes the form @xmath87 with @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an impact parameter , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the radius and volume of the cell , respectively . assuming linear barotropic equations of state , @xmath92 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : jp ] ) becomes @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the mass of matter component @xmath14 in the cell .",
    "let us now examine the above result for the filled - beam case .",
    "( hw39 ) gives the quantity @xmath86 for matter uniformly distributed in a ball of radius @xmath95 at the center of a cell of radius @xmath90 .",
    "setting @xmath96 in this equation , and adding our derived pressure contribution @xmath97 to this yields @xmath98 from which it is seen that a cosmological constant ( @xmath99 ) does not contribute , in consistency with eq .",
    "( [ eq : fldev ] ) .    as an interesting example , consider a flat cosmological model in which ordinary matter ( @xmath100 ) constitutes only 10 % of the total matter content , i.e. , @xmath101 , while the rest is made up of some homogeneously distributed `` x - matter '' with @xmath102 .",

    ", we also show the result for @xmath108 , corresponding to dust ( i.e. , equivalent to an einstein  de sitter model with @xmath109 , of which 90 % is homogeneously distributed ) .",

    "with which it agrees well .",
    "note that the normalization differs between the three cases since @xmath78 depends on the cosmology . nevertheless , from the slope of the curves",
    ", one can conclude that lensing effects become more prominent for large negative @xmath111 .",
    "this is _ not _ what one would expect from studying the geodesic deviation equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fldev ] ) , since negative pressure causes less focusing of a beam .",
    "however , for negative @xmath111 , distances will get larger for a fixed redshift , which means a larger number of lenses between the source and the observer ( see , e.g. , turner @xcite ) .",
    "the method of holz & wald ( @xcite ) which we adopt has a number of properties , which we summarize and comment upon here :    * * local nature of lensing * + if @xmath6 is small within distances much smaller than the hubble radius @xmath112 , then the curvature ( and thereby the lensing effects ) is determined locally within @xmath113 .",
    "likewise , if we assume that there is no strong correlation on scales greater than a clustering scale @xmath114 , it follows that the curvature is determined locally within @xmath114 . * * relevant scales * + the question now is what relevant clustering scale to use .",
    "hw find it convenient to employ the typical separation between galaxies , and argue that galaxy clustering should have a negligible effect on magnification , as shown in some of their simulations .",
    "they also argue that the smallest relevant scale for matter clumping is of the order @xmath115 , since objects smaller than that would not give a coherent lensing effect over the angular size of most of the interesting sources . *",
    "* generality * + for the case of point masses , hw demonstrate that their results are fairly insensitive to the size of individual point masses",
    ". furthermore , their results are rather insensitive to clustering .",
    "this is tested by cutting out a tube in a uniform matter distribution and distributing `` stars '' within this tube . *",
    "* largest effects * + based upon their results , hw conjecture that randomly distributed point masses should cause the largest lensing effects of all possible mass distributions for a given average mass density . note that the point - mass case corresponds to the limit in which all matter clumps lie well within their einstein radii [ see eq .",

    "( [ eq : mref ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : dcalc ] ) ] . since the potential for a truncated sis halo is equal to the point - mass potential for @xmath197 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sispotentials ] ) , the sis luminosity distribution will be shifted towards the point - mass distribution when lowering @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , the agreement between our results and those in hw is better for lower @xmath105 , as can be seen by comparing the curve corresponding to the sis luminosity distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : model-2 ] with fig .",
    "taking also the number of lenses into consideration , we expect the largest lensing effects for the @xmath194 cosmology , followed by the @xmath195 case , and the smallest effects in the @xmath196 cosmology .",
    "for nfw halos , the value of the characteristic radius @xmath135 will depend on the cosmology used , the largest value obtained with the @xmath195 cosmology , followed by @xmath194 and the @xmath196 case .",
    "now , it can be shown that for a fixed halo mass , @xmath147 , the nfw potential will approach the point - mass potential when lowering @xmath135 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : nfwpotentials ] , @xmath198 . ] .",
    "therefore , we expect the closest resemblance to the point - mass case for @xmath196 , followed by @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the method of hw , or rather the numerical implementation of it , has some limitations due to the approximations used .",
    "since the area of the light beam when exiting a cell is computed by linear interpolation from the value before entering the cell [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ada ] ) ] , we need very small cells or very many cells to get robust results .",
    "small cells means shorter interpolations while a large number of cells tends to average out the error in every interpolation .    in order to quantify this effect",
    "we have made some tests with empty and filled beams using cell sizes obtained from the schechter matter distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : error ] , we have plotted the mean fractional error in area vs. redshift . to get a mean fractional error less than one percent , one would need to have @xmath199 . note that this is the average error of individual measurements ; the average value will be very close to the real value even at very small redshifts . for the cosmology used ( @xmath200 ) , a redshift of @xmath201 corresponds to @xmath202 cells",
    "another drawback with the hw method is that there is no way to keep track of multiple images from the same source .",
    "this poses no problem when the time delay between a primary image and secondary images is big enough to allow observational separation of the images .",
    "however , if image separation is not observationally feasible , we have to compensate for multiple images . this will be the case when considering microlensing , see sect .",
    "( [ subsec.ola ] ) .    a typical case of multiple imaging is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing4 ] .",
    "note that the secondary image has undergone a caustic crossing and that its parity has been reversed ( this corresponds to @xmath203 ) .",
    "also , the secondary image is demagnified compared to the primary image ( remember that it is the relation between @xmath57 and the area that determines the magnification ) .",
    "since the quantity @xmath57 is more or less constant in our method , areas of secondary images often becomes very big , i.e. , very dim .    for a point mass lens ,",
    "the time delay between two images with flux ratio @xmath141 is given by @xmath204 where @xmath205 for a lens at redshift @xmath127 and a flux ratio of two , we get @xmath206 as an illustration , to get a time delay of the order of weeks , we need @xmath207 .",
    "the image separation in the same case ( assuming a source at @xmath126 ) is given by @xmath208 i.e. , a mass of @xmath207 will give an image separation of @xmath209 .",
    "in the realistic case that a galaxy is causing the lensing , the surface brightness of the lens may make the detection of secondary images impossible ( porciani & madau @xcite ) .      now , let us discuss what kind of information we can obtain from secondary images . in fig .",
    "[ fig : points ] we see what a source would look like in a universe filled with point - mass lenses .",
    "since the deflection angle from a point mass can be very large , there will , apart from the primary image , be one secondary image next to every point mass lying in the vicinity of the line - of - sight to the source ( not to mention all images with two or more caustic crossings ) .. ] most of these images will be _ very _ dim , i.e. not observable .    in our implementation of the hw method , we can happen to follow any one of these .",
    "however , the vast majority of the flux will almost always be in the primary image , the only exception being the case where we have a point mass very close to the line - of - sight ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : points2 ] ) . in this case , the primary and the brightest secondary image will have almost equal flux . if we want to consider the total flux from a source we need to correct for these images .",
    "of course , the correction would have to be larger in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : points2 ] .",
    "multiple - image corrections are discussed in sects .",
    "[ subsec.ola ] and [ subsec.olsis ] below .",
    "note that if we happen to follow any of the weak secondary images in fig .",

    "[ fig : points ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : points2 ] . from this",
    "we conclude that weak secondary images does not give any valuable information concerning the total flux of a source .      filling the universe with sis - type galaxies",
    ", the situation would be quite different .",
    "no longer can we have very large deflection angles , and multiple images will therefore be less common .",
    ", where @xmath177 is the velocity dispersion of the lens and @xmath210 is the impact parameter , i.e. , the magnitude of the deflection does not depend on @xmath210 . ] since we are typically dealing with galaxy masses , images will be separable and we need only to consider secondary images bright enough to be observable . since for ( almost ) every source",
    ", there will be at most one secondary image , it is a more straightforward procedure to associate to every secondary image a primary image .      here , we will discuss reasonable corrections when images are non - separable .",
    "since we have a very large number of images with two or more caustic crossings contributing to the flux of the total image , we can not correct for each one of them .",
    "instead , we will make a first correction for the brightest secondary image using the approximation that lensing effects from a single lens ( cell ) is dominant .",
    "this is the so called one - lens approximation .",
    "possible tests of the validity of this assumption is discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : cc ] .",
    "its plausibility is also reinforced by figs .  8 and 9 in hw .",
    "we can now use standard analytical expressions for one - lens systems for this correction : @xmath211 in fact , this formula is valid also for secondary images but one then has to include the sign in @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath212 .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq : mucorr ] ) is only valid for the brightest secondary image , and one should therefore not apply it to very weak , secondary images . also note , that to make the correction self - consistent , the magnification should be defined as the ratio of the expected area if the most prominent cell is empty and the real area .",
    "it is easy to see that the most important effect of this correction is to make the high magnification tail more pronounced .",
    "it is as straightforward to compute the total magnification using the one - lens approximation with a sis - lens . for a primary image",
    "we get @xmath213 for a secondary image we get @xmath214 since images are separable in the majority of cases , this is perhaps most interesting to use as a consistency check for the total luminosity .",
    "in order to validate our implementation of the method , we have performed a number of tests .    *",
    "* filled and empty beam distances * + first  in order to get an independent check  we have compared results from our implementation of the hw method using empty cells and cells with a homogeneous dust component with analytical empty - beam and filled - beam results ( using the angsiz routine , see kayser et al .",

    "this average will be equal to the fl value , @xmath217 when computing @xmath58 for a source , one has to consider the total flux if there are multiple images .",

    "our results show , in agreement with previous work ( holz & wald @xcite ; metcalf & silk @xcite ) that the ( unlikely ) case of having most of the dark matter distributed in the form of point masses can be quite easily distinguished from more realistic halo models , if a sufficient number of supernovae can be detected at large redshifts .",
