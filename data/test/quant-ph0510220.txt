    "multilevel atomic and molecular systems offer many possibilities for the investigation of coherence effects and quantum control of the interactions among the quantum participants . in recent years , substantial attention has been paid to the study of coherence effects in atomic and molecular systems  @xcite , such as coherent population trapping ( cpt )  @xcite , electromagnetic induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite , ultraslow propagation of light  @xcite , and autler - townes splitting  @xcite . more and more experiments are shifted from atomic systems to molecular systems for more practical applications  @xcite .",
    "the multitude of quantum levels of molecular systems provides rich coupling schemes and thus a test ground for the study of coherence effects in molecular systems .",
    "however , compared to atomic systems , molecules have small transition dipole moments .",
    "a general characteristic of molecular systems is that they have many relaxation pathways .",
    "this in turn makes these systems much more open compared to closed atomic systems where excited states decay channels are limited .",
    "furthermore , the degeneracy of the energy levels and other complications make the observation of coherence effects considerably more challenging from an experimental point of view .",
    "the rabi frequency , the key parameter , is proportional to the transition dipole moment matrix element and the coupling field amplitude .",
    "thus cw laser experiments that involve small transition dipole moment matrix elements are therefore quite difficult . however , a judicious choice of laser wavelengths and beam propagation geometry can help overcome the doppler broadening  @xcite .",
    "the autler - townes splitting was observed in a high temperature diatomic lithium gas using multiple resonance excitation to over come the doppler effect  @xcite .",
    "recently , eit in ultracold atomic gases , and autler - townes splitting effect in ultra - cold molecule formation and detection have been reported  @xcite .",
    "the study of coherence effects in molecular systems is timely and important not only for fundamental understanding of these effects , but also for the practical applications . in this paper , we present the detailed experimental investigation and the corresponding theoretical analysis of electromagnetically induced transparency and dark fluorescence in a cascade three - level diatomic lithium in an inhomogeneously broadened environment .",
    "we have incorporated the effect of the magnetic sublevel ( m ) degeneracy of the rotational levels in the lineshape analysis and report @xmath6-dependent lineshape splitting .",
    "we show that the coherence is remarkably preserved even when the coupling field was detuned far from the resonance .",
    "the open property of molecular systems will be discussed in our theoretical calculation .",
    "we also demonstrate that the coupling laser field dependent splitting of the upper level can be used as a new method for measuring the molecular transition dipole moment matrix element  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the theoretical model and the derivation of the analytical expressions to account for the experiments .",
    "we describe the experimental observations in section iii .",

    "however , a sharp dip also appears in the middle of the oodr fluorescence signal of the upper @xmath1 level .",
    "the oodr fluorescence peak , splits into two components as shown in fig .",
    "the fluorescence of both excited states is drastically reduced under the action of the strong coupling laser ( l2 ) . because the intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the population of the corresponding excited state , the origin of the fluorescence dips",
    "is based on the fact that the molecules can not be excited by the probe laser and the coupling laser to either the intermediate level @xmath0 or the upper level @xmath1 from the ground - state under a strong coupling laser .",
    "since the strong coupling laser l2 modified the transition from @xmath126 to @xmath0 , the ground state molecules can not absorb the probe laser photons and be excited to the excited state @xmath0 at the resonance frequency .",
    "the remarkable result is that the second transition does not transfer the molecules to the higher excited @xmath4 state either .",
    "the experimental results also show that the stronger the coupling laser is , the deeper and wider are the dips as shown in fig .",
    "5 . in a sense of the first transition ,",
    "the molecule becomes transparent under the action of the strong coupling laser ( electromagnetically induced transparency ) and thus the molecules must stay in the ground state .",

    "these values are 18 ns , and 16.15 ns , respectively . from fig .",

    "the week probe laser beam is 222 @xmath132 m ( @xmath1331 mw ) .",
    "the transit rate ( _ w _ ) of the molecules entering and leaving the interaction region can be estimated according to reference  @xcite and is @xmath133 2 mhz .",
    "the branching ratios @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be estimated from the franck condon factor calculation to be 0.1 and 0.2 , respectively .",
    "we perform the calculations based on the analytical solution of eq .",
    "( 26 ) by searching the value of the transition dipole moment matrix element and the @xmath57 to best match the experimental spectrum of @xmath134 in fig .",
    "the resulting value of the transition dipole moment matrix element @xmath135 for @xmath136 is 1.45 ( @xmath137 ) a.u .. after the completion of this step , we calculate the corresponding spectrum of @xmath138 , which is again in good agreement with the experimental spectrum shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) as dashed lines .",
    "however , the experimental dip is much narrower than the theoretical calculation .",
    "both the theory and the experimental spectra clearly show that a strong coupling laser modified the transitions .",
    "the molecules stay in the ground state even though the laser ( l1 ) was tuned to the resonance of the first transition as long as the coupling laser ( l2 ) couples the upper transition with adequate coupling strength @xmath139 .",
    "the optically opaque molecular gas now becomes transparent for laser l1 ( eit ) .",
    "again , the dip is not due to the population transfer to the upper state @xmath32 by the coupling laser l2 , because the upper state has no population either .",
    "the fluorescence of both excited states becomes dark in the presence of the strong coupling laser .",
    "keeping all parameters fixed , decreasing the strength of the coupling laser , we obtain the single peak oodr for @xmath134 as shown by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "the calculated @xmath138 without the coupling laser is identical to the doppler broadened profile as shown in fig .",
    "as indicated in the equation ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) that the rabi frequency of the coupling field @xmath74 , has a dominant influence on the depth and width of the dips of @xmath134 once @xmath140 .",
    "the decay rate of the upper level @xmath32 and the branching ratios @xmath141 , have a contribution to the depth of the dip of the spectra as well .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath141 , the collision rate @xmath57 and the transit rate @xmath142 have a dominant contribution to the linewidth and the wings of the upper state spectra .",
    "this is understandable and expected compared to a closed system .",
    "a large @xmath57 means that the coherence will be destroyed quickly , and a large transit rate _",
    "_ implies an effective shorter lifetime of the excited levels , while small values of _ w _ and large branching ratios imply that the system is better described by a closed system .",
    "the dip of @xmath138 is none zero since the p transition of the probe laser can populate the m=0 sublevel of @xmath143 state , while the coupling field transition is a q transition , the m=0 level is decoupled from the coupling field transition(see fig .",
    "also , the doppler broadening greatly reduces the width of the transparency window .    when the coupling laser is off resonance , the dips are still preserved as long as the coupling field is strong enough .",
    "however , the position of the dips will change to the opposite side of the detuning of the coupling field ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "we can easily find , by checking the integral equation ( 34 ) , that the position of the dip is at the modified two - photon transition : @xmath145 due to the doppler effect , and at @xmath146 for doppler free case .",
    "this is a completely coherent process , since the detuning of l2 prevents the population buildup on level @xmath32 .",
    "the splitting of this component depends on the coupling field strength and the detuning of @xmath144 as well as the linewidths of the two excited states .",
    "two experimental spectra with coupling laser detuned from the resonance by 420 mhz , and 1.0 ghz , respectively , but with the same laser intensity as in the fig .",
    "4 are shown in fig .",
    "6(a)-(b ) , which show that the coherence is robustly preserved .",
    "we plot 14 @xmath6 sublevel components of fig .",
    "6(b ) in an expanded scale to show the @xmath6-dependent splitting by using equations ( 26 ) , and ( 34 ) in fig .",
    "for a q transition the splitting of each @xmath6 component is proportional to the value of @xmath6 .",
    "in summary , we have observed the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and dark fluorescence in an inhomogeneous broadened lithium molecular system .",
    "the power dependent upper state splitting spectrum provides a useful method to experimentally measure the transition dipole moment matrix element .",
    "the value of this parameter from fits of the experimental spectra agrees very well with the theoretical calculation .",

    "in the fitting of the experimental spectra we find that the branching ratio value can be varied over a large range and still give a reasonable fit .",

    "<S> we observed electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and dark fluorescence in a cascade three - level diatomic lithium system using optical - optical double resonance ( oodr ) spectroscopy . when a strong coupling laser couples the intermediate state @xmath0 to the upper state @xmath1 of @xmath2 , the fluorescence from both @xmath3 and @xmath4 states was drastically reduced as the weak probe laser was tuned through the resonance transition between the ground state @xmath5 and the excited state @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the strong coupling laser makes an optically thick medium transparent for the probe transition . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the fact that fluorescence from the upper state @xmath1 was also dark when both lasers were tuned at resonance implies that the molecules were trapped in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we used density matrix methods to simulate the response of an open molecular three - level system to the action of a strong coupling field and a weak probe field . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical solutions were obtained under the steady - state condition . </S>",
    "<S> we have incorporated the magnetic sublevel ( m ) degeneracy of the rotational levels in the lineshape analysis and report @xmath6 dependent lineshape splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical calculations are in excellent agreement with the observed fluorescence spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the coherence is remarkably preserved even when the coupling field was detuned far from the resonance . </S>"
