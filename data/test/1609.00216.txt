    "in recent years there has been growing interest in investigations of two - dimensional nanostructured metallic structures .",
    "the metallic nanostrutures derive their unique optical properties from their ability to support collective electron excitations , known as surface plasmon - polaritons(spps ) .",
    "surface plasmon polaritons are quasi - two - dimensional electromagnetic waves that propagate along a dielectric - metal interface with amplitudes that decay exponentially with increasing distance into both of the neighboring media  @xcite .",
    "the possibility to confine the light into sub - wavelength volumes , which stems from the latter feature , has a profound effect on the efficiency of many optical processes and makes surface plasmon - polaritons very sensitive to surface properties . in this paper",
    "we are interested in exploring nanostructured two - dimensional metallic surfaces which may provide a platform for a realistic optical analog of one - way electronic devices such as diodes and transistors .",
    "the majority of the devices supporting unidirectional propagation of surface plasmon polaritons are based on nonlinear optics and magneto - optical(mo ) effects  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "for example , a waveguide has been designed in the form of a gap between a semi - infinite dielectric photonic crystal and a semi - infinite metal to which a static magnetic field is applied , in which electromagnetic waves can propagate in only one direction  @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently shown  @xcite that if the photonic crystal in this waveguide structure is fabricated from a transparent dielectric magneto - optic material , to which the magnetic field is applied , the window of the frequencies within which the waveguide displays one - way propagation can be achieved at much lower magnetic field strengths than are required for this purpose in the structure proposed in ref .  .",
    "the application of a magnetic field to a structure to produce one - way propagation of the surface or guided waves it supports may not always be an option for some applications of those waves .",
    "this consideration stimulates searches for surface structures that produce one - way propagation of a surface or guided wave without the need of a magnetic field .",
    "for example , we have shown recently  @xcite that a 2d system consisting of a square array of scatterers deposited on a metal surface in a triangular mesh exhibits asymmetric transmission of a spp when a diffractive structure is added to one side of the structure .",
    "this structure does not require either electrical nonlinearity or the presence of the magnetic field to accomplish this .",
    "the asymmetric transmission is a consequence solely of the geometry of the structure .    in this paper",
    "we describe yet another surface structure that has different transmissivities for surface plasmon polaritons incident on it from opposite directions .",
    "the surface structure consists of a metal - air interface where the metallic region is formed by two metallic segments whose interface between them is periodically modulated .",
    "we first employ a theoretical approach based on the thin phase screen model  @xcite which allows determining the transmitted electric field in the form of a fourier expansion .",
    "we show that when the interface has the form of a rectangular grating with a critical value of the modulation depth , the zero - order term in the fourier expansion of the transmitted electric field can be suppressed in a certain frequency range .",
    "the + 1 and -1 modes which unlike the zero - order beam do not satisfy reciprocity , remain propagating in this frequency range , and their diffraction efficiencies can be independently modified by varying the period of the grating and/or the angle of incidence and , as a result , the transmittance of spp propagating through this structure may become asymmetric .    the suppression of the zero - order transmitted beam has been used effectively by serebryannikov and his colleauges in designing structures that produce asymmetric transmission of volume electromagnetic waves through them  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "these are all slabs whose two surfaces are both periodically corrugated , but with different periods , and in some cases also pierced by a slit of subwavelength width .",
    "although the structures studied in these papers are volume structures , not surface structures ; the electromagnetic waves illuminating them are volume waves , not surface waves ; and the means for suppressing the zero - order transmitted beam are different from ours , the mechanisms by which they produce asymmetric transmission are basically the same as those producing this effect in our surface plasmon polaritonic structure .",
    "the predictions obtained by our use of the thin phase screen model have been verified by using numerical simulations based on the finite - element frequency - domain method , which confirm that suppression of the zero - order mode occurs when there exists a sufficiently large refractive index contrast between the two metals at a certain frequency .",
    "consequently , the transmittance of the structure relies on the diffraction efficiencies of the + 1 and -1 bragg beams that can be modified by varying the angle of incidence .",
    "namely , we find that within a certain range of the incidence angle an asymmetry in transmittance for the -1 mode exists , while the + 1 mode is completely suppressed . by varying the material and geometrical parameters of the diffractive structure one can control the contrast transmission that characterizes the degree of the asymmetry .",
    "this property of the structure is demonstrated by the results of computer simulation calculations .",
    "the system we consider in this paper consists of vacuum in the region @xmath0 , while the region @xmath1 consists of two metalllic segments characterized by frequency - dependent dielectric functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the interface between the two metals is characterized by the profile function @xmath4 which separates the neighboring metals in the regions @xmath5 and @xmath6 - see fig.[fig1 ]    we denote the third component of the electric field of a surface plasmon polariton in the vacuum region @xmath7 evaluated on the surface @xmath8 , @xmath9 , by @xmath10 .",

    "( 16 ) and thus , for example first - order waves have a non - zero amplitude at the same wavelength at which the zero - order beam vanishes .",
    "we demonstrate asymmetric transmission characteristics of a spp by the use of the thin phase screen model in the case of the periodically modulated interface characterized by the rectangular periodic profile given by eq.([eq15 ] ) .",
    "a key idea underlying asymmetric transmission in such a planar grating structure is the suppression of the zero - order bragg mode in a certain frequency range , which occurs at a given wavelength for the critical value of the modulation depth @xmath42 given by eq.([eq17 ] ) .",
    "then one can modify the diffraction efficiencies of the first - order bragg beams by varying the period @xmath27 of the grating and/or the angle of incidence @xmath45 .      in the following we consider the case of normal incidence and study transmission through a lamellar grating at an au / al interface with a period @xmath46 . by using the refractive index contrast @xmath47 between au and al for the wavelength @xmath48 , one obtains the critical modulation depth @xmath49 at which the amplitude of the transmitted zero - order bragg beam vanishes according to relation ( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the zero - order bragg beam is shown in fig.[fig2_new](a ) where the transmittance @xmath50(red dashed curve ) reveals a profound suppression in the vicinity of the reference wavelength @xmath51 .",
    "this feature reflects the strong dependence of @xmath50 on the modulation depth @xmath42 , which is evident in comparison with results obtained for the interface characterized by a 10@xmath52 smaller modulation depth @xmath53 for which the interface becomes transparent in the wavelength range considered(full blue curve ) .",
    "the frequency range in which the suppression of the 0-order mode occurs can be modified by varying the modulation depth @xmath42 as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2_new](a ) where the minimum in the transmittance @xmath50 associated with the zero - order spp bragg beam is red - shifted to the wavelength @xmath54 when the modulation depth is increased by a factor of 2 - see the magenta dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2_new](a ) .",
    "the dependence of the critical depth @xmath42 on the wavelength @xmath55 is affected by the strongly dispersive behavior of the dielectric functions of both metals in the wavelength range considered , which give rise to a decreasing refractive index contrast as the wavelength is increased .",
    "in fact , the choice of the au / al interface stems from the fact that these two metals yield a large refractive index contrast @xmath43 at the wavelength @xmath48 .",
    "for example , the transmittance of the zero - order bragg beam through a au / ag interface to a large extent resembles that for a au / al interface - see fig .",
    "[ fig2_new](a ) .",
    "however , it requires at the same wavelength a significantly larger modulation depth @xmath56 , which renders this configuration technologically more challenging from the point of view of both its numerical and experimental verification .",
    "we offer the following simple intuitive explanation of this result . the difference in optical path lengths between the waves incident on the regions of the surface where @xmath57 and where @xmath58 is equal to @xmath59 .",
    "when @xmath42 has its critical value @xmath60 this difference in path lengths equals @xmath61 .",
    "the resulting destructive interference of these two waves leads to the suppression of the zero - order beam .",
    "an analogous interpretation can be given for the higher - order beams .",
    "for example , the first - order waves incident on the regions of the surface where @xmath57 and where @xmath62 are in phase , and thus interfere constructively at the same wavelength at which the zero - order beam vanishes .",
    "now we inspect the possibility of achieving asymmetry in the transmittance of the first - order bragg beam in the case of normal incidence .",
    "we found that a lamellar grating at an au / al interface with the period @xmath46 and modulation depth @xmath63 exhibits a suppression of the zero - order bragg beam in a certain frequency range , while the transmittance of the 1-order bragg beams becomes significantly enhanced in this frequency range in comparison with that associated with a shallow modulation @xmath53  see the dashed - lines in fig .",

    "we have demonstrated that a system consisting of an air - bimetal interface , whose boundary between the two metallic segments is periodically modulated , possesses a different transmissivity for a surface plasmon polariton incident on it from one side of it than it has for a surface plasmon polariton incident on it from the opposite side .",
    "this asymmetric transmission of a surface plasmon polariton is based on the suppression of the zero - order bragg beam , which is not transmitted through the structure for a certain value of the modulation depth of the periodically corrugated boundary between the metals .",
    "consequently , the mechanism for the asymmetry in the transmittance is related to the higher bragg modes that are excited on the composite metallic waveguide structure .",
    "we have shown that the diffraction efficiencies of the @xmath78 and @xmath79 bragg beams can be modified by varying the period and/or the angle of incidence , and for a certain range of the incidence angle one can observe asymmetry in the transmittance of the @xmath79 mode while the @xmath78 mode is completely suppressed .",
    "by varying the material and geometrical parameters of the diffractive structure one can control the contrast transmission that characterizes the degree of the asymmetry .",
