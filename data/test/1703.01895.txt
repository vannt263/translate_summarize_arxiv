    "galaxy clusters are an ideal landscape for tracing structural growth in the hierarchical universe .",
    "one of the initial surprises brought by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ was the discovery of `` cold fronts '' ( cfs ) in galaxy clusters .",
    "first found in abell2142 @xcite and abell3667 @xcite , cfs manifest themselves as bright , arc - shaped surface brightness edges .",
    "most cfs are thought to be the product of gas `` sloshing '' , which occurs following a non - head - on encounter between two clusters @xcite .",
    "when the subcluster approaches the main cluster , the latter s intracluster medium ( icm ) becomes detached from the dark matter ( dm ) halo under the influence of ram pressure .",
    "later on , the icm falls back into the potential well of the main cluster and starts sloshing .",
    "consequently , the cool , dense gas in the core is driven outward , where it is held by the hotter , less dense gas , forming a contact discontinuity .",
    "observationally , gas temperature inside the discontinuity is lower than in the outside ( hence the name of _ cold front _ ) , whereas gas density drops abruptly , maintaining a nearly continuous gas pressure across the cf .",
    "these characteristics are markedly different from those of shock fronts .    numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that gas sloshing can be easily induced by minor mergers , and that the sloshing features may remain detectable for more than a billion years , which naturally explains why cfs are so commonly found in nearby galaxy clusters .",
    "the minor merger scenario is further supported by the fact that many clusters hosting cfs exhibit a spiral pattern in the core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is also seen in high - fidelity gas sloshing simulations @xcite and can be explained as the result of the angular momentum being transported from the subcluster to the main cluster .",
    "the cfs are excellent tools for studying cluster dynamics , as well as the physics of the icm @xcite .",
    "for instance , the relatively intact cold fronts , not easily deformed by rayleigh - taylor instability , can place constraints on the mass of the underlying dm halo in clusters @xcite . observations also show that many cfs have very sharp edges , with widths less than @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that the cfs in the merging cluster abell3667 show no sign of kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) in the direction of merging .",
    "they proposed that khi is suppressed by magnetic fields `` frozen '' along the surface of the cfs .",
    "the estimated field strength based on the suppression of khi is on the order of 10  @xmath9 g , and the magnetic pressure is approximately 0.10.2 of the thermal pressure .",
    "khi at sloshing cfs has been extensively studied in simulations which take various factors into consideration , such as viscosity and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "in particular , simulations with magnetic fields find that highly magnetized layers ( compared to other parts of the icm ) will easily form underneath the cfs due to shear amplification by the sloshing motions",
    ". the magnetic pressure in these layers can be nearly in equipartition with the thermal pressure .",
    "this relatively strong magnetic field may play a crucial role in suppressing khi .",
    "viscosity may play a similar role .    in this work ,",
    "we present an x - ray study of the cold fronts in the massive galaxy cluster abell2204 ( hereafter a2204 ) . early observations by _ rosat _ showed that a2204 has a regular x - ray morphology @xcite .",
    "it was with _",
    "observations that substructures in the core of a2204 were found @xcite , which include a spiral pattern and two cfs .",
    "the cfs appear smooth and sharp , showing no sign of khi @xcite . here",
    "we use deeper _ chandra _ exposures , along with new insights from numerical simulations , to analyze these two cfs in detail , in order to constrain the physical properties of the icm in a2204 .",

    "we describe the observations and data preparation . in section",

    "the projected temperature rises from @xmath17 3.5 kev at the very center to @xmath17 11 kev at @xmath20 ( @xmath17 210 kpc ) , then drops further out ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with a massive cluster .",
    "we also employed the deprojection method of @xcite , which results in a deprojected temperature profile ( red curve in figure  [ temperature ] ) similar to the observed profile .",
    "although a2204 has a regular morphology on large - scale , the cluster is highly disturbed in the core ( figure  [ fig.xraycore ] ) , which looks like a tapered water drop with a `` tail '' to the east .",
    "a spiral pattern is prominent in the core , which starts from the southeast at a radius of @xmath21 , then wraps outward clockwise to southwest , reaching a radius of @xmath22 , and grows fuzzy in the south .",
    "careful examination reveals a gap in the southwest , and a small `` bite '' in the northwest .    two distinct surface brightness edges , which delineate the spiral at a radius of @xmath22 in the west and a radius of @xmath23 in the east , are readily seen ( figure  [ fig.xraycore ] ) .",
    "the western edge is very sharp at position angles between @xmath24 , but blurs further northward and southward .",
    "the eastern edge is prominent in the direction between @xmath25 , but loses its clear trace southward as it merges into the  rim \" , i.e. , the innermost core .",

    "to do so , we generated the radial surface brightness profile centered on the x - ray peak ( [ r.a .",

    "there is an excess at the position of the western edge , and a depression immediately outside the eastern edge ( between @xmath27 ) , which is understandable because the western edge increases the overall model surface brightness at those positions .",
    "there is also an excess corresponding to the tail .",
    "the morphology and location of the two edges strongly suggest that they are the result of gas sloshing due to a recent gravitational perturbation of the icm . in the appendix",

    "previous work @xcite have shown that the two edges are cfs . here",
    "using the deeper exposure , we perform an in - depth study of their physical properties . for",
    "each of the two edges , we extract spectra from six concentric sectors ( figure  3b ) and fit them with the wabs*apec model to obtain the projected temperature profiles across the cfs .",
    "we can see that the temperature jump at the western cf is as large as by a factor of @xmath172 ( figure  [ fig : westplot]a ) .",
    "the temperature jump at the eastern cf is not as abrupt as at the western cf ( figure  [ fig : eastplot]a ) .",

    "it is noteworthy that since the cluster core is sloshing predominantly in a plane , the spherical symmetry assumed by this method is not exact and is a source of systematic error .",
    "nevertheless , the deprojected temperature profiles at both edges support the conclusion that they are cfs .",

    "@xcite formulated a theoretical model for spiral sloshing flows in cluster cool cores , arguing that the overall pattern of motion can be separated into a cold , `` fast '' flow and a hot , `` slow '' flow , implying that @xmath76 , which is also seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "simulations also show that the cold flow is subsonic , with typical mach numbers of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "given this fact from the simulations and the measured value of the sound speed @xmath78 underneath the front surface , we may make a rough estimate for the tangential velocity of the cold gas @xmath79 , which we show in table [ tab : khi_supp ] .",
    "determining the gravitational acceleration @xmath71 from the x - ray data is not straightforward , since the gas in the core is not in an equilibrium state , as evidenced by the sloshing motions , and hydrostatic equilibrium can not be assumed in this region .",
    "however , n - body / hydrodynamics simulations of sloshing ( ascasibar & markevitch 2006 , zuhone , markevitch & johnson 2010 ) indicate that the dm core of the main cluster should be relatively stable against the influence of the subcluster , and that hydrostatic equilibrium is a good approximation outside the sloshing region .",
    "these two facts together indicate that fitting a mass profile to these outer regions and extrapolating it inward should give a reasonable estimate of the mass inside the cfs .    for this purpose , we use the deprojected density and temperature profiles in the radial range of @xmath80  kpc to compute a mass profile assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , and fit this profile to an nfw profile ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 ) : @xmath81 the parameters we obtain are @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the implied gravitational accelerations at the western and eastern cfs are @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .    in table",
    "[ tab : khi_supp ] we show the minimum wavelength @xmath86 of khi modes that can be suppressed by gravity . at either the western or eastern front",
    ", @xmath87 is still quite large compared to the size of the cold fronts ( despite the uncertainties ) , indicating that gravity is incapable of suppressing perturbations that should still be visible .",
    "we note that richard et al .",
    "( 2010 ) used strong gravitational lensing to derive the total mass in the cluster core , which we find to be nearly twice our derived mass at a radius of @xmath1765 kpc . in this case , the minimum wavelength that can be stabilized becomes half that quoted in table [ tab : khi_supp ] .",
    "one must also consider the possibility that although the cold front discontinuity is indeed unstable to khi , there simply has not been enough time for perturbations to grow . to determine whether this is the case",
    ", we calculate the khi growth timescale via @xmath88 and tabulate the timescales @xmath89 corresponding to @xmath86 in table [ tab : khi_supp ] .",
    "the timescales are rather long ( with substantial uncertainty ) , indicating that for perturbations at these wavelengths , they may simply have not had enough time to grow since the formation of the cold fronts .",
    "however , perturbations at smaller wavelengths will grow faster .",
    "for example , a perturbation with a wavelength of 10  kpc will grow with a timescale of @xmath90  myr for both cfs , so perturbations of these scales may be expected to be observed .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    " sound speeds are calculated from deprojected temperature .",
    "this indicates that such perturbations may be suppressed by the action of a strong magnetic field layer aligned with the front surface .",
    "such layers should arise naturally at sloshing cold fronts @xcite , which are produced by the shear amplification of an existing magnetic field , stretching the magnetic field lines parallel to the cold front surface and increasing the magnetic field strength .",
    "the minimum magnetic field in the layer necessary to suppress khi is given by @xcite : @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the magnetic field strengths on either side of the front .",
    "the simulations of @xcite showed that sloshing motions amplify the magnetic field strength predominantly _ below _ the front , so @xmath93 , giving an estimate for the minimum magnetic field strength in the cold flow .",
    "these estimated magnetic field strengths , on the order of 10 @xmath94 g , are listed in table [ tab : khi_supp ] .",
    "such field strengths could be easily produced by shear amplification of the magnetic field at the cold front surfaces , as demonstrated in simulations by @xcite .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we drew on the results of simulations to infer the probable velocity of the sloshing cold gas underneath the cold fronts .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , with the exception of keshet et al .",
    "2010 , no works have attempted to measure the tangential velocity underneath a sloshing cold front .",
    "previous works ( e.g. , vikhlinin et al .",
    "2001 ) have attempted to estimate the velocity in the free - stream region ahead of a merger cold front , but the sloshing scenario here is distinct from a major merger .",
    "therefore it is worth making the velocity estimate to see if it is consistent with what we expect from simulations .",
    "@xcite noted an unphysical jump in the mass profile derived from the x - ray data within an angular sector containing a cold front edge in the relaxed cluster a1795 .",
    "in such a case , although the gas pressure itself is continuous , its first derivative is discontinuous .",
    "they argued that this was evidence for radial acceleration of the gas underneath the front .",
    "@xcite later noted that this would cause an unphysical gap to open along the cold front .",
    "instead , they formulated an argument that the difference in gravitational acceleration is compensated by the centripetal acceleration of the tangentially moving gas underneath the cold front surface . under suitable assumptions",
    ", they derived the following expression for the velocity shear ( their equation 2 ) : @xmath95\\ ] ] where @xmath96 .",
    "we will use this expression to make an estimate for the velocity @xmath79 of the cold component of the western cold front , since it exhibits the properties of pressure continuity with a pressure derivative discontinuity . to compute the pressure derivative",
    ", we assume that , in the immediate vicinity of the cold front , the temperature is constant with radius on both sides and that the behavior of the density on either side of the front is given by the @xmath26-model and power - law fits from above ( equation 1 ) . we further assume for simplicity that the motion of the cold front is in the plane of the sky , which is not unreasonable according to its spiral - like morphology .",
    "we determine that @xmath97  km  s@xmath98 , corresponding to a mach number of @xmath99 , which is very similar to the value taken from the simulations discussed in section 5.1 .",
    "we note that the value we obtain for the dimensionless pressure discontinuity parameter from @xcite @xmath100 is marginally consistent with their upper limits for this parameter for the western cold front of a2204 ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "the relatively large error bars on our estimates for the velocity of the gas underneath the front and the pressure discontinuity point to the need for further study .",
    "despite the fact that our deep exposure of a2204 and the apparent smoothness of its western cold front provides the opportunity to attempt such an estimate , it is still difficult to measure this number accurately , primarily due to the uncertainty in the gas temperature on either side of the front .",
    "additionally , this estimate depends on the assumptions that the gas moving underneath the front can be approximated as having circular motion and that this motion is in the plane of the sky .",
    "the best way to quantify the uncertainty associated with these assumptions would be to analyze mock x - ray observations of simulations of cold fronts , where we could carry out the same analysis as for a2204 , but would be able to project the cold front along slightly different lines of sight and compare our estimate for the velocity directly to the velocity field in the simulation .",
    "we leave this for future work .",
    "we present an analysis of the combined _ chandra _ observation of the rich cluster a2204 .",
    "this deeper dataset allows us to study the substructures in the icm in more detail than previous works .",
    "based on the x - ray data , we are able to determine the exact position of the sb edges : the western edge is located at @xmath101 from the x - ray peak , and it is most prominent within the direction @xmath102 . from the direction of @xmath103 further north and @xmath104 further south , the edge is no longer clear . at the western edge , the projected temperature profile has a huge jump ( @xmath105 ) and the density has a prominent drop ( @xmath106 ) , while the pressure profile is continuous .",
    "therefore , it is a typical cold front . the eastern edge is closer to the center ( at the radius of @xmath107 ) , and it is prominent within the direction of @xmath108 , especially in the middle . at this edge @xmath109 and @xmath110 . thus the east edge is also a typical cold front .",
    "both cfs show no visible kelvin - helmholtz eddies in _ chandra _ s x - ray images .",
    "this suggests that khi is strongly suppressed on these fronts .",
    "we have investigated whether or not gravity could suppress khi , and found that the gravitational acceleration of the underlying dm halo is likely too weak to provide adequate suppression for all wavelengths that would be visible ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "it may be the case that there has not simply been enough time for these perturbations to develop , but this is also unlikely for smaller - wavelength perturbations .",
    "therefore , we have investigated the possibility that a magnetic field may be responsible for khi suppression .",
    "based on the front properties , we estimate that the minimum value of the magnetic field to suppress khi is @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the western and eastern cfs , respectively .",
    "finally , we also use the pressure derivative discontinuity at the western cf to make an estimate for the tangential velocity of the gas underneath the front , and find that the gas is moving with @xmath114 , consistent with the velocity of sloshing gas seen in simulations .",

    "the spiral - like sloshing feature indicates that the orbital plane of the perturber be roughly perpendicular to the line - of - sight @xcite .",

    ", three large galaxies can be identified in hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide - field planetary camera 2 images ( figure  [ fig.hst ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy labeled `` a '' in figure  [ fig.hst ] is the central cluster galaxy ( ccg ) of a2204 , which is probably interacting with the neighboring galaxy  b \" @xcite . in the far - ultraviolet , galaxy `` a '' shows filamentary structures , indicating active star formation @xcite .",
    "the x - ray peak has a small ( @xmath172@xmath115 ) offset to the south from the center of the ccg , which can be supporting evidence of gravitational perturbation of the icm .",
    "on the other hand , interaction between ccgs is unlikely to result in the spiral structure .",
    "an alternative scenario is that galaxy ",
    "b \" is the remnant of a subcluster that has just finished its second passage , which would have caused gas sloshing at the first passage long time ago @xcite .",
    "this picture , however , is not supported by the regular morphology of the two edges and their relatively small distances from the cluster center @xcite .      because a perturbing subcluster spends most of the time in the cluster outskirts @xcite , we searched for the perturber in the @xmath116-binned image ( covering a few mpc across a2204 ) , and found two interesting extended sources , one located in the southeast and the other , fainter one in the east ( figure  [ fig.bin16 ] ) .",
    "we fitted the spectra of the southeast source and found its temperature to be @xmath117 , assuming the same redshift as a2204 .",
    "its 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity is @xmath118 . using the scaling relation in @xcite ,",
    "this leads to a gas mass of @xmath119 and a dynamical mass of @xmath120 , assuming that the icm accounts for @xmath121 of the total mass .",
    "this appears to be a reasonable mass for a perturbing subcluster .",
    "we then searched for optical counterparts using sdss images , and found a small group of galaxies clustering around the southeast object ( figure  [ fig.sdssse ] ) .",
    "however , the mean redshift of these galaxies provided by simbad is 0.178 .",
    "if these galaxies lie at the distance of a2204 , this leads to a relative radial velocity of @xmath122 , uncomfortably high for a subcluster , the orbit of which should be close to the plane of the sky to produce the spiral - like sloshing feature .",
    "the extended source in the east has too few x - ray photons for a meaningful spectral analysis .",
    "moreover , no galaxy with a similar redshift as a2204 can be identified around it . we are thus left with no clear candidate perturber within the _ chandra _ field - of - view ."
