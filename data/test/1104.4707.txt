    "such phases , first proposed by anderson , have been put forward in the context of high @xmath0 superconductivity as a possible precursor state , but they can occur in a much broader class of situations , both in real materials @xcite and in microscopic models @xcite .",
    "their characterization is challenging  on the experimental side , it requires generally involved low - temperature techniques to prove the absence of long - range magnetic order down to temperature @xmath1 , and concerning the theory , either in hubbard - like models or in localized spin models , spin liquids usually result from frustrating interactions but compete with a variety of possible ordered phases , from usual antiferromagnetic ( af ) order to valence bond crystals , spin nematics etc.@xcite    clear evidence of a spin liquid ground state was found from an exact solution of the kitaev model @xcite of spins @xmath2 on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "this liquid ground state is characterized by a gapless spectrum ( with low - energy excitations described in terms of majorana fermions ) and gapped vortices .",
    "the kitaev model itself triggered a large variety of studies , focusing on topological properties , ( non)-abelian excitations , extensions to higher dimensions@xcite , effects of magnetic@xcite or non - magnetic impurities and of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "besides its mathematical beauty and the original properties mentioned above , the kitaev model was recently found @xcite to be relevant to orbitally degenerate systems with strong spin - orbit coupling such as layered iridates na@xmath3iro@xmath4 and li@xmath3iro@xmath4 . there",
    ", around each ir atom , the octahedral environment [ see fig .  [ struc](a ) ] of oxygens results in a configuration with one hole in the @xmath5 manifold ; and the large spin - orbit coupling selects locally a low - energy doublet of states defining a pseudospin @xmath2 ; and finally , superexchange processes between ir ions driven by moderately strong coulomb interactions lead to an effective description by the kitaev - heisenberg model @xcite for pseudospins @xmath2 residing on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the study of this model showed the robustness of the spin liquid phase for finite af heisenberg interactions [ small compared to ferromagnetic ( fm ) kitaev interactions ] , and a quantum phase transition between this liquid phase and a stripe - ordered phase . in na@xmath3iro@xmath4 , where interaction parameters could be close to this transition , af order was found by magnetization and specific heat measurements@xcite and x - ray magnetic scattering@xcite .",
    "the question of how vacancies influence the order and the magnetic response in the kitaev - heisenberg model is of both experimental and theoretical interest . indeed",
    "the vacancy can act as a probe allowing to measure spin correlations in its vicinity ; and it can also have drastic effects on these correlations . for concreteness , in @xmath6 spin-@xmath2 antiferromagnets with long - range order , a non - magnetic impurity can enhance the staggered magnetization around the vacancy @xcite . in dimerized phases ,",
    "the impurity is accompanied by a spinon , which is typically confined to the impurity in valence bond crystals and deconfined in resonating valence bond liquids @xcite , although the question of the confinement length can be subtle @xcite . in a nel - ordered phase , the impurity results in a curie- type contribution to the finite-@xmath7 susceptibility @xcite . in the spin - liquid phase of the kitaev model , a magnetic moment",
    "is induced around a spinless vacancy ; interestingly , its contribution to the spin susceptibility diverges logarithmically for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this makes it relevant to investigate the vacancy - induced magnetic response in a model interpolating between @xmath6 and kitaev - like interactions .",
    "moreover , in the iridate samples studied up to now , a substantial amount of disorder might be present , e.g. , site - mixing effects with non - magnetic alkaline ions on the hexagonal ir - sublattice @xcite , which should be taken into account for proper understanding of their physical properties .",
    "our aim is to study the effect of non - magnetic vacancies ( and of pairs of vacancies ) in the different magnetic phases of the kitaev - heisenberg model , at zero temperature .",

    ", one should obviously need to consider systems of ( at least ) hundreds of ir atoms , and to take into account the energy cost of domain walls between regions of different stripe orientations .",
    "moreover , obviously not all vacancies are grouped into distinct first , second or third nearest neighbor vacancy pairs ; in particular the effect of unpaired vacancies , even at zero external field , could be subtle , although one can imagine single vacancies pinning walls between domains of different stripe orientation .",
    "we have considered here several important aspects of the kitaev - heisenberg model , which , despite its simple structure , displays in its @xmath1 phase diagram three distinct phases , two of which are antiferromagnetically ordered while the third one is a spin liquid .",
    "we employed numerical methods ( exact diagonalization ) for our investigation of the properties of the model in a magnetic field and the effect of vacancies on the magnetic properties .",
    "the numerical methods were complemented by classical and perturbative analysis particularly in the frame of the stripe phase .",
    "we showed how the ground state phases evolve in a magnetic field oriented along the @xmath66 $ ] direction ( one of the local easy axes of the kitaev - heisenberg hamiltonian ) .",
    "we found that the three phases are robust to small fields .",
    "next , we analyzed the influence of the field direction .",
    "the magnetic response is qualitatively distinct in the different phases . in the stripe phase ,",
    "the magnetization can be described by a spin canting mechanism , which also provides an understanding of the anisotropy in the numerically obtained susceptibilities . in the liquid phase",
    ", we compared the effect of small magnetic fields and of small heisenberg interactions , each considered as a perturbation of the kitaev hamiltonian .",
    "such perturbations are shown to induce specific patterns in the spin - spin correlations beyond nearest neighbors , while at larger fields a transition into the spin - polarized phase occurs .",
    "we determined the phase diagram of the model in a @xmath66$]-field , with good agreement between numerical results and analytical estimates .",
    "for the latter analysis , we took into account both the spin canting and the quantum fluctuations in the ordered and polarized phases .",
    "this phase diagram has similarities with its counterpart for a @xmath29 $ ] field orientation @xcite , however , a major difference between them is that for a @xmath66$]-field we do not see any quantum critical point in the vicinity of the stripe - liquid phase transition .",
    "we presume that this is related to the absence of a field - induced gap in the low - energy spectrum of the liquid phase for a @xmath66$]-field@xcite .",
    "subsequently , we focused on the effect of non - magnetic vacancies on the spin correlations and the magnetic response of the model . for a single vacancy in the liquid phase",
    ", we found that the spatially anisotropic magnetization pattern around the vacancy is related to the anisotropy of spin correlations in the vacancy - free system .",
    "up to finite - size effects inherent to our approach , these results are also in agreement with predictions of a non - linear response to a small @xmath66$]-field , whose effect is mostly seen on one specific neighbor of the vacancy . in the stripe phase ,",
    "a vacancy coupled to a small [ 001]-field breaks both the @xmath45 ( time reversal ) and the @xmath47 ( orientational ) symmetry characterizing the ground state manifold ; a single stripe pattern is selected , which is not continuously tiltable by the field in contrast to the vacancy - free situation .",
    "having in mind the description of systems at finite vacancy concentration , we considered the interplay of two vacancies sitting either on nearest or further neighbor sites .",
    "again the magnetic response to an easy - axis field depends strongly on the nature of the phase , but it also depends sensitively on the relative position of vacancies . in the liquid phase a non - linear behavior , much stronger than for the single - impurity case , is seen if the two vacancies are on the same sublattice , while the response remains linear if they reside on different sublattices . in the stripe phase , vacancy pairs select a specific stripe orientation even at zero field .",
    "this selection mechanism , depending on the value of coupling parameter @xmath60 , can be well understood by a perturbative approach evaluating locally the effect of quantum fluctuations .",
    "the response to a small field depends on whether the selected stripe pattern is tiltable or not for this field direction@xcite .",
    "although the strongest selection effect is caused by nearest neighbor vacancy pairs for a wide range of @xmath60 , further neighbor pairs have to be considered as well in the vicinity of the stripe - liquid transition .",
    "therefore we conclude that the intrinsic randomness of vacancies , in combination with the selection mechanism induced by vacancy pairs , may lead to spin - glass behavior in the stripe regime . there , a vacancy concentration of a few percents should be enough for the system to show a glassy behavior , with a tendency to the formation of stripe - ordered nanodomains around vacancy pairs .    finally , we comment on the possible relevance of this work to layered iridates , which motivated the derivation of the kitaev - heisenberg model .",
    "the experimental data ( magnetic susceptibility , heat capacity@xcite ) on na@xmath3iro@xmath4 indicate antiferromagnetism at low temperature and a substantial magnetic anisotropy . yet",
    ", the angular dependence of the measured susceptibility is qualitatively opposite to that found for a vacancy - free model .",
    "we then showed that non - magnetic vacancies in the dilute limit , i.e. , where interactions between vacancies are irrelevant , can reverse locally this tendency by blocking the spin - canting for some field directions .",
    "the recent x - ray magnetic scattering data @xcite ruled out the nel state , implying that the kitaev interaction in na@xmath3iro@xmath4 may dominate over a simple heisenberg coupling .",
    "in addition to the stripe phase intrinsic to the kitaev - heisenberg model , the so - called  zig - zag  spin order is also consistent with the data @xcite .",
    "an element in favor of a description of layered iridates a@xmath3iro@xmath4 ( a@xmath269li , na ) by the kitaev - heisenberg model is the comparison of the low temperature susceptibilities of these compounds@xcite . using our result @xmath138 for the stripe phase",
    ", we found a relation between @xmath60 values in these two compounds , which indicates that the li compound , as the na - based one , is most probably in the stripe phase but much closer to the transition towards the spin liquid .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with previous work@xcite estimating the relative @xmath60 values from a comparison of the paramagnetic curie temperatures .",
    "the application of uniaxial pressure on a single crystal of li@xmath3iro@xmath4 might even drive the system into the liquid phase .    to describe the experimental situation in layered iridates on a quantitative level",
    ", other factors such as lattice distortions have to be considered as well .",
    "in particular , the lattice distortions may bring about substantial anisotropy in the ground state @xmath270-factors and in the van vleck contribution to the magnetic susceptibility , originating from transitions to higher lying spin - orbital quartet split by non - cubic ( tetragonal and/or trigonal ) crystal fields .",
    "furthermore , these distortions may lead to spin interactions not included in the kitaev - heisenberg model . for intermediate strength of spin - orbit coupling like in iridates",
    ", these effects might be essential for a quantitative description of magnetic properties .",
    "moreover , our study suggests that a glassy behavior could occur in the vicinity of the spin liquid phase ; in this context , considering the present model at larger scales , with a finite density of vacancies , could help to explore the effect of temperature .                                                                    a quantitative comparison of our calculated susceptibilities to those measured in ref .",
    "would include also the effect of temperature , especially as the measured anisotropy was also large in the paramagnetic phase ."
