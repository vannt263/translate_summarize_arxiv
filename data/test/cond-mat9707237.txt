    "the slow relaxation of density in granular materials under tapping has attracted much theoretical interest recently @xcite since knight @xmath0 @xmath1 @xcite carried out systematical experimental measurements of density as a function of time for a vibrated granular material .",

    "here @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constant parameters .",
    "this four  parameter fit was obtained from experimental data without theoretical motivation .",
    "previous theoretical models predicted different functional forms . in the model of barker and mehta @xcite",
    ", particles can relax both independently , as individual particles , and collectively , as clusters .",
    "their model leads to a sum of two exponential terms , which is not in accord with the logarithmic form of eq.(1 ) .",
    "the model proposed by hong @xmath0 @xmath1 @xcite is based on a diffusing void picture .",
    "it predicts a power  law dependence of height reduction as a function of time , @xmath9 with @xmath10 , which means that the density increases linearly until saturation .    using frustrated ising models , herrmann and his collaborators @xcite gave a numerical confirmation of the logarithmic density relaxation as eq .",
    "( [ log ] ) in their monte  carlo simulations . in their models",
    ", frustration plays a crucial role .",
    "they claim that frustration is generated in granular materials by the steric constraints imposed by the hard  core repulsion of neighboring grains and the subsequent interlocking .",
    "the link of the frustrated lattice gas models to real granular packing is explained in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a one  dimensional discrete lattice model for granular compaction under tapping based on a simple physical picture .",
    "numerical solutions to the model equation indicate that the density relaxes in a logarithmic manner , precisely as eq .",
    "we also solve the continuum version of the model analytically in the asympototic limit ( @xmath11 ) to confirm eq .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the model equation .",
    "numerical and analytical solutions to the equation are given in sections iii and iv respectively .",
    "section v is devoted to discussion .",
    "the density of particles @xmath12 should satisfy the continuity equation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the current density . we may rule out any simple density  gradient term in the current density which leads to isotropic diffusion , since the thermal energy is too small to triger the motion of grains . the current density may be written as a product of density and velocity : @xmath15 to specify the the functional form of velocity , let us consider a one  dimensional lattice model along z  direction .",
    "gravity is along the negative z  axis . in the absence of tapping , motion of grains under the action of gravity",
    "is possible only when the geometric constraint is satisfied , i.e. , enough void space below the grain .",
    "if @xmath16 is the particle density , the void density at the site just below is @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the velocity is nonzero only when the ratio @xmath18 less than @xmath19 .",
    "this means a step function for the velocity @xmath20 : @xmath21 in the absence of tapping .",
    "the effect of tapping in granular compaction is to overcome the bottleneck effect , i.e. , to make the geometric constraints not as strict as the above .",
    "motion of grains is also possible when @xmath22 with the help of tapping .",
    "we may therefore replace the above step function with a peak function of an exponential form : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants dependent of the vibrational intensity @xmath26 with the amplitude @xmath27 and the frequency @xmath28 of oscillation and @xmath29 the gravitational constant .",
    "the precise @xmath30dependences of @xmath25 and @xmath24 are beyond the scope of the present theory .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ vel ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ con ] ) , we obtain our model equation for density relaxation : @xmath31 with @xmath32 where @xmath33 is infinitesimal in the continuum limit .",
    "this model is defined more definitely on a lattice : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is given by eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) putting @xmath36 .",
    "in order to solve numerically eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , we supply two fixed boundary conditions , @xmath37 at the bottom and @xmath38 at the top of the system . the following discrete version of eq .",
    "( [ latticemodel ] ) ensures no flux at the boundaries , i.e. , conservation of particle density as a whole is ensured at each time step @xmath39 with @xmath35 given by eq .",
    "( @xmath40 ) with @xmath36 .",
    "we update \\{@xmath41 } according to eq .",

    "1 shows snapshots of density profiles at three different time steps .",
    "we see that as particles move downward voids move upward and pile at the top .",
    "as soon as we start updating from a random initial configuration , a sharp interface between a particle phase and a void phase begins to emerge .",
    "its position can be easily identified as the location where density changes sharply from non  zero value to zero . since the position of the interface takes only integer values on the lattice and information extracted from it",
    "is therefore limited , we resort to calculate the position of center of mass @xmath45       & = & \\sum_{z=1}^{l } z \\rho(z , t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we take it for granted that the average density measured in experiments is proportional to the inverse of @xmath46 .",
    "we determine the proportional prefactor as follows .",
    "the minimum value of h can be obtained from a density distribution of a step function , i.e. , @xmath47 which is actually a static solution to the model equation eq .",
    "( [ rule ] ) . here",
    "@xmath48 is determined by the density conservation and is a time ",
    "independent quantity : @xmath49 .",
    "the value of @xmath50 corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ step ] ) is @xmath51 .",
    "we therefore use the following expression for the average density @xmath52    starting from random initial configurations , we discard the data for initial transient time period and do not make computation of @xmath3 until at the interface between the particle phase and the void phase the density jumps from zero to some reasonably finite value .",
    "our density of unity corresponds to the densest close packing and it sets the scale for density . for the case of sphearical particles in reality ,",
    "the densest close packing has a density of about 0.64 while the mechanically least stable configurations have the most loose value of about 0.55 @xcite ( in our scale 0.859 ) .",
    "2 shows one typical plot of @xmath3 calculated from the lattice model .",
    "the time step when we start calculating @xmath3 in fig . 2 is set to be the time origin .",
    "it is the instant when the density gap at the interface is about @xmath53 in our density scale . the numerical data in fig .",
    "2 can be very well fitted by the logarithmic form of eq .",
    "( [ log ] ) , which is also shown in the figure .",
    "3 displays two density profiles at different time steps for the particle phase while zero density in the void phase is not plotted .",
    "we find that the density profile can be fitted by the following expression @xmath54^{\\beta(t)}.\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are time  dependent parameters .",
    "the fit to the numerical data is also plotted in fig .",
    "3 . in the whole range",
    "the density is step - function - like @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the location of the interface .",
    "( [ z - step ] ) is different from the generalized fermi ",
    "dirac distribution proposed by hayakawa and hong @xcite and found by herrmann and his collaborators in simulations of frustrated ising models @xcite .",
    "the generalized fermi ",
    "dirac distribution does not have a singularity in the density profile but changes continuously from larger values to zero rapidly within a boundary layer whose width is determined by one of the parameters in the distribution . on the other hand , our model gives a sharp interface between the particle phase and the void phase and therefore the model does not permit any density value smaller than the most loose density for granular compaction . in this sense , we may say that in addition to the granular solid phase and the void phase the generalized fermi  dirac distribution allows a granular @xmath60 phase where density changes drastically @xcite .",
    "our model describes only the granular compaction under tapping where the grains do not fly as in a gas ( and therefore no inertia terms appear in the velocity expression eq .",
    "( [ vel ] ) ) .",
    "as we observed in the simulations , there is always a sharp interface between the particle phase and the void phase .",
    "we may therefore generally postulate the solution to eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the step function such that @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "we now determine the time dependence of the location of the interface @xmath59 by solving the equation in its continuum version , eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) . substituting eq .",
    "( [ 0 ] ) into the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , we obtain @xmath67 where dot stands for time deriative . the @xmath68 function in eq .",
    "( [ 0 ] ) gives us the following @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) @xmath70      & = & f(a(z , t ) , a_{-}(z , t ) ) \\theta(b(t ) - z)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 stands for the value of @xmath72 just below @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath74 with infinitesimal @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath75 thus , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) reads @xmath76 integrating the right hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and of eq . ( [ 2 ] ) from @xmath77 to @xmath78 and taking the limit of @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath80    now we make an approximation . from the simulations we know that @xmath81 depends on @xmath73 very weakly .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ z - dep ] ) decreases as time increases .",
    "when @xmath11 , @xmath82 .",
    "we therefore make the following aussmption in the asymptotic limit of @xmath11 @xmath83 the conservation of total density is then expressed as @xmath84 with the same @xmath48 as in eq .",
    "( [ step ] ) .    using eq .",
    "( [ atinterface ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ ass1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ass2 ] ) we have @xmath85 letting @xmath86 leads in the asymptotoc limit ( @xmath87 ) @xmath88 where @xmath89 is constant .",
    "putting @xmath90 , we have @xmath91    now we integrate eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) for @xmath4 from @xmath92 to @xmath4 and for @xmath93 from @xmath94 to @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the average density ( i.e. , a(t ) ) of the particle phase at time @xmath92 and @xmath4 respectively @xmath98 the asymptotic solution of eq .",
    "( [ int_1 ] ) is readily obtained by using the formular @xmath99 and the expansion for @xmath100 @xmath101.\\ ] ] the final form for eq .",
    "( [ int_1 ] ) is given by @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath104 where , however , the first two terms are negligible compared with the third one for the left side , so that we obtain the final form of the average density @xmath105 this is precisely the same form as eq .",
    "( [ log ] ) .",
    "the form of eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) perfectly agrees with the simulations as shown in fig .",
    "we have shown that the discrete lattice model eq .",
    "( [ latticemodel ] ) exhibits an anomalously slow density relaxation .",
    "although our model is quite simple , it contains essential features of granular materials that granular particle can move only when there is enough void below the particle . tapping the system weakens this constraint and we have taken into account this property by assuming the velocity as eq .",
    "( [ vel ] ) . in this way , the logarithmic time ",
    "dependence has been obtained , which is consistent with experiments .",
    "to our knowledge , no model equation in terms of space  time coordinates , which produces a logarithmic relaxation , has been available so far in granular systems .",
    "the analytical study indicates that the logarithmic relaxation originates from the factor @xmath106 $ ] in the velocity eq .",
    "( [ vel ] ) .",
    "when @xmath107 , the velocity becomes extremely small whereas it is finite when @xmath108 .",
    "thus we expect that the logarithmic relaxation occurs as far as the system processes this property independent of the detailed form of the velocity .",
    "actually , we have confirmed by simulations that the velocity such as @xmath109 leads to the essentially same relaxation and the existence of a sharp interface in the density profile .",
    "this fact implies a universal feature of the logarithmic relaxation not only restricted to granular materials but also for other systems where velocity vanishes abruptly like an essential singularity when the density exceeds some threshold value .",
