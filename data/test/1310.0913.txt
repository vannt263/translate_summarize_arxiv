    "currently accepted theories and many experimental results suggest that hadronic matter changes to quark matter in high - density and/or high - temperature regimes by way of the deconfinement transition .",
    "the properties of quark matter have been actively studied theoretically in terms of the quark  gluon plasma , color superconductivity @xcite , magnetism @xcite , and experimentally in terms of relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite , and early - universe studies and compact stars @xcite .",
    "such studies are continuing to provide exciting results @xcite .",
    "presently , we consider that compact stars consist of not only nuclear matter but also other matter such as hyperons and quarks .",
    "we call such stars _ hybrid stars_.    because many theoretical calculations have suggested that the deconfinement transition is of the first order at low temperature and high density @xcite , we assume that it is a first - order phase transition here .",
    "the gibbs condition @xcite then gives rise to various structured mixed phases ( smps ) .",
    "the smps proposed by heiselberg et al .",
    "@xcite and glenndening and pei @xcite suggest a crystalline structure for the mixed phase in the cores of hybrid stars .",
    "such structures are called `` droplets '' , `` rods '' , `` slabs '' , `` tubes '' , and `` bubbles '' .",
    "we present the equation of state ( eos ) for the mixed phase taking into account the charge screening effect @xcite without relying on any approximations .",
    "we investigate the inner structures of these stars @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we review the inner structures of hybrid stars and apply our eos to a stationary rotating star .",
    "we use the eos given in our paper @xcite , which is presented in our framework . therefore , our approach is only briefly explained here .",
    "thermal equilibrium is implicitly achieved at @xmath0 .",
    "we consider that the hadronic and quark matter and the mixed phase are @xmath1 stable .",
    "we employ density functional theory ( dft ) under the local density approximation @xcite . to account for the confinement ,",
    "we introduce a sharp boundary between the two phases employing the bag model @xcite with a surface tension parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the determination of the surface tension between hadronic and quark matter is a difficult problem .",
    "thus , many authors have treated the surface tension as a free parameter and have observed its effect @xcite ; we take the same approach in this study . to determine the charge screening effect",
    ", we also conduct the calculations without the screening effect .",
    "we then apply the eos derived in our paper @xcite to the tolman  oppenheimer  volkoff ( tov ) equation @xcite . after that",
    ", we apply our eos to a stationary rotating star .        [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we see an important relation between radius and rotation .",
    "ordinarily , the `` radius '' of the star is single - valued because we consider that the star is spherical . however",
    ", if the star is rapidly rotating , we have to pay attention to the different `` radii '' . because of the effect of the rotation , a star deforms from a sphere to an ellipse .",
    "therefore , we introduce two values , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are the  equatorial radius \" and the  polar radius \" , respectively .",
    "figure  [ r - f_sc ] shows @xmath3 and @xmath4 with respect to rotation .",
    "if the rotation rate is 400 hz or faster , the two radii are different .",
    "therefore , we have to note the effects of rotation on rapidly rotating stars .",
    "in this study , we demonstrated how charge screening affects the hadron ",
    "quark mixed phase in the cores of hybrid stars , taking into account rotation effects .",
    "we found that the inner structures are strongly affected .",
    "in particular , a core consisting of quark matter could appear due to the charge screening effect .",
    "another case , kaon condensation , has been studied @xcite and the results are similar to those of our papers @xcite .",
    "we used a simple model for quark matter and nuclear matter . to obtain a more realistic picture of the hadron ",
    "quark phase transition , we need to take into account color superconductivity @xcite and the relativistic mean field theory @xcite",
    ". we will then be able to provide more realistic results .",
    "neutron stars have other important physics  magnetic fields . however , the origin of these magnetic fields is still unknown .",
    "there are ways to explain magnetic fields based on the spin - polarization of the quark matter @xcite .",
    "however , whether the quark matter exists or not strongly depends on the eos . in this calculation , we did not take into account magnetic fields .",
    "if we include a magnetic field , the resluts are very interesting with respect to the rotation of the star .",
    "this work was supported in part by the principal grant of the kagawa national college of technology ."
