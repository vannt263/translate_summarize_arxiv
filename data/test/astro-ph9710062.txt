    "a key prediction of inflationary cosmology is a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of initial fluctuations composed of energy density ( scalar metric)@xcite and gravitational wave ( tensor metric)@xcite perturbations .",
    "the two components leave imprints on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy that are potentially detectable and distinguishable .",
    "the spectrum of each component is characterized by a spectral index ( @xmath2 ) which determines how the perturbation amplitude varies with wavelength .",
    "each spectrum is also predicted to be nearly scale - invariant ; using the standard notational convention , this corresponds to @xmath3 for the scalar metric fluctuations and @xmath4 for the tensor metric fluctuations .",
    "the spectral indices and the ratio of tensor to scalar amplitudes on any given scale are determined by the equation - of - state during inflation or , equivalently , the inflaton potential .",
    "a prediction of inflation is a simple relation between @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the ratio of tensor to scalar amplitudes that applies to nearly all inflationary models.@xcite unlike other features of inflation , such as flatness or a nearly harrison - zeldovich spectra , the predicted relation between the spectral indices and amplitudes was unanticipated prior to the development of the inflationary model and is , in this sense , a unique stamp of inflation .",
    "it is hoped that forthcoming measurements of cmb anisotropy@xcite , complemented by measurements of cmb polarization@xcite , can be used to detect a tensor component and to test the inflationary scenario .",
    "the cmb temperature anisotropy power spectrum can be expressed in multipole moments @xmath7 , where each @xmath7 can be divided into a sum of independent tensor ( @xmath8 ) and scalar ( @xmath9 ) subcomponents .",
    "while the individual tensor and scalar contribution to the temperature anisotropy can not be observed independently , the presence of a strong tensor component may be measured through correlations of polarization and temperature.@xcite the amplitude of these correlations , characterized by the ratio of tensor - to - scalar multipole moments , @xmath10 , can be used to test the inflationary scenario . however , the moments do not depend on the primordial relation between spectral indices and amplitudes alone .",
    "the power spectrum also depends on the evolutionary history since inflation ended .",
    "for example , in the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model in which @xmath11 , the inflationary prediction@xcite is well - known to be @xmath12 this prediction is modified for open cdm models or cdm models with a cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) , in which the post - inflation evolution is different , as has been studied previously.@xcite    the purpose of this paper is to discuss the gravitational wave contribution to the cmb anisotropy in a new class of cosmological models where a significant fraction of the energy density of the universe takes the form of a cosmic scalar field ( @xmath0 ) with an equation - of - state different from that of matter , radiation or cosmological constant.@xcite the scalar field component of the cosmic fluid has been dubbed  quintessence \" and cosmological models based on a combination of quintessence and cold dark matter components are known as qcdm models . in a recent paper@xcite ( henceforth , referred to as paper i ) , we computed the background evolution , the cmb power spectrum and the mass spectrum for qcdm models .",
    "we showed that models of this type result in a significantly better fit than scdm to the cmb temperature power spectrum , the mass power spectrum , early structure formation , and distant supernovae and gravitational lens count measurements . in paper",
    "i we restricted our attention to the case of strictly scale - invariant ( @xmath13 ) spectra of purely scalar metric perturbations . in the present paper , we discuss how the tensor contribution to the cmb anisotropy is modified by the presence of a @xmath0-component .",
    "we compute the full , scalar plus tensor cmb power spectrum for qcdm models based on inflationary initial conditions and determine how the relation between primordial spectral indices and amplitudes predicted by inflation is modified in qcdm models .",
    "the result is a generalization of a key test of inflationary cosmology .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we briefly review the predictions of inflation for the spectrum of initial tensor and scalar perturbations and the resultant contributions to the cmb anisotropy . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we discuss how the computation of the tensor contribution is modified in qcdm models .",
    "( the computation of the scalar spectrum has been described in paper i. ) we then present the computed tensor contribution to the cmb power spectrum for qcdm models and compare with an scdm model . in section [ section4 ] we present our key result , the generalization of the inflationary relation between spectral index and amplitude for qcdm models .",
    "inflation predicts a nearly scale - invariant power spectrum of energy density ( scalar metric ) and gravitational wave ( tensor metric ) fluctuations . for both subcomponents ,",
    "the power spectrum as a function of fourier mode @xmath14 can be expressed to lowest order in terms of the hubble constant and its time - derivatives evaluated when the fourier mode @xmath14 was stretched beyond the horizon during inflation , at @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the friedmann - robertson - walker scale factor and @xmath17 is the hubble parameter , which depends on the expectation value of the inflaton field , @xmath18 .",
    "expanding around some given wavenumber @xmath19 , the power spectrum can be parameterized by spectral amplitudes @xmath20 and spectral indices @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the planck mass .",
    "a signature of inflation is the series of relations between spectral indices and amplitudes.@xcite the tensor spectral index , @xmath25 and the power spectrum amplitudes obey the relation@xcite @xmath26 the ratio of power spectrum amplitudes can be related to the ratio of tensor - to - scalar contributions to the cmb anisotropy quadrupole moment @xmath27 we will comment on the coefficient below .",
    "the scalar spectral index satisfies a more complicated relation : @xmath28 however , for all but an exceptional set of inflaton potentials , the hubble parameter evolves so slowly during inflation that the second term is negligible and @xmath29 . in this case , @xmath30 hence , the relations arise because all parameters associated with the perturbation spectrum are ultimately determined only by @xmath31 and its derivatives during inflation .    the coefficient in eqs .",
    "( [ key1 ] ) and ( [ key ] ) is crucial for the purposes of this paper . in the scdm model",
    ", the coefficient is set largely by the sachs - wolfe effect , the variation of the gravitational potential on the surface of last scattering , which is only very weakly dependent on model parameters such as the hubble constant or the baryon density .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ key ] ) has been presented in the literature@xcite as a robust prediction of inflation .",
    "however , this prediction is valid _ only _ if @xmath32 . in models in which the matter density is less than unity , such as the qcdm models considered in this paper or models with a cosmological constant",
    ", there is a large , integrated sachs - wolfe contribution to the large angle cmb anisotropy , which changes the predicted relationship between the spectral indices and the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "because the integrated sachs - wolfe effect depends on the time variation of the gravitational potential along the line - of - site to the last scattering surface , the amplitude of the effect is sensitive to the present value of @xmath33 , the equation - of - state @xmath34 , and the variation of @xmath34 with time .",
    "consequently , the coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ key ] ) is modified by a model - dependent function ( section [ section4 ] ) , the central result of this paper .",
    "in this section we discuss the qcdm models for which we have computed the gravitational wave contribution to the cmb anisotropy .",
    "we present the equations necessary to evolve the background and tensor perturbations .",
    "we discuss the properties of the q - matter and their dependence on the effective potential for @xmath0 , @xmath35 , and identify two broad categories of models .",
    "this classification simplifies our survey , in the following section , of the imprint of gravitational waves in qcdm models .",
    "finally , we present some sample results of our computation of the tensor contribution to the cmb anisotropy spectrum .      the qcdm models are constructed from spatially flat , friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) space - times containing baryons , cold dark matter , neutrinos , radiation and a cosmic scalar field or q - component .",
    "the space - time metric is given by @xmath36 where @xmath16 is the expansion scale factor and @xmath37 is the cosmological time .",
    "the background equation of motion , the energy density , and the pressure for the q - matter are @xmath38 where the dot represents @xmath39 . hence , the relations in ( [ qbackground1]-[qbackground2 ] ) supplement the usual background equations to specify the evolution of all components of the cosmological fluid .",
    "fluctuations about the background space - time can be represented in the synchronous gauge , where the linearized space - time metric is @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the unperturbed spatial metric and @xmath42 is the metric perturbation , which includes scalar ( s ) and tensor ( t ) perturbations .",
    "the equations of motion for the scalar perturbations and the fluctuations in the q - component have been described elsewhere .",
    "the transverse , traceless gauge constraints and equations of motion of the gravitational wave perturbation are @xmath43{h^{t\\,i}}_j = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the spatial metric @xmath41 .",
    "because we have modeled the q - matter as a scalar field , the explicit form of the equation of motion for the tensor perturbations is unchanged ; there are no additional inhomogeneous tensor fields or anisotropic tensor sources ( as would occur if the q - component were modeled as a tangled web of non - intercommuting cosmic strings,@xcite for example ) .",
    "hence , the only effect on the evolution of the gravitational wave amplitude is through the background expansion .",
    "it is then straightforward to adopt the standard algorithms for evolving the boltzmann equations with tensor fluctuations for the problem at hand .",
    "we have modified a series of standard boltzmann cmb codes based on the synchronous gauge , maintaining a fixed relationship between the initial amplitudes of the scalar and tensor power spectra , for the computations described below.@xcite      the cmb anisotropy spectrum , both scalar and tensor subcomponents , is sensitive to the detailed time evolution of the hubble parameter @xmath31 since last scattering . in the case of the qcdm models ,",
    "these subcomponents are affected by the time evolution of the equation - of - state of the q - component , @xmath45 , which in turn reflects the form of the potential , @xmath35 .",
    "we find that for a wide range of potentials , however , there are two broad categories by which we may classify the behavior of the models .",
    "hence , we will focus our attention on representative models from each of these categories .",
    "the two categories correspond to cases where @xmath34 increases monotonically versus cases where @xmath34 has begun to oscillate about an asymptotic value by the present epoch . in either case , the initial value of the scalar field @xmath0 is assumed to be set at a particular value by some conditions ( _ e.g. _ , inflation ) in the early universe .",
    "so long as @xmath46 , @xmath0 remains fixed because the hubble red shift term ( @xmath47 ) dominates the equation - of - motion .",
    "consequently , the energy density is nearly constant during the early history of the universe so that @xmath48 .",
    "once @xmath31 reduces sufficiently that @xmath0 begins to evolve down the potential , the balance of kinetic and potential energy in @xmath0 changes and @xmath34 begins to grow . depending on @xmath35 and the initial conditions , @xmath34 may continue to grow up to the present epoch or it may begin to oscillate around some asymptotic value . the first possibility corresponds to the  monotonic \" class of models . here",
    "we find that the imprint of @xmath0 on the cmb anisotropy and the mass power spectrum is well - approximated by the result obtained if @xmath34 is held constant at roughly the mean value during the period when @xmath49 is non - negligible .",
    "see figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the oscillatory class of models corresponds to cases where @xmath0 evolves to a point in its potential where @xmath34 begins to oscillate around some asymptotic value .",
    "one example is a potential in which @xmath0 evolves towards , and then begins to oscillate about , a minimum of @xmath35 before the present epoch .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath34 begins to oscillate around a mean value determined by the shape of the potential , _",
    "@xmath50 for a quadratic potential ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 for a quartic potential ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "see figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "another example is an exponential potential of the form @xmath54 ; as the potential energy begins to dominate the universe , the equation - of - state first overshoots , then relaxes towards @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "we will use this exponential example to represent the oscillatory-@xmath34 category .",
    "note that a given potential can belong to either the monotonic or oscillatory class depending on parameters and the initial conditions for @xmath0 .",
    "namely , for some choices of the initial value of @xmath0 , @xmath34 may have begun to oscillate around its asymptotic value by the present epoch . for other choices ,",
    "@xmath0 may not have evolved so far by the present epoch and @xmath34 has been increasing monotonically . for example , while an exponential potential is illustrated both in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( under monotonic ) and fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( under oscillatory ) , different initial conditions , and values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , have been selected in the two cases .",
    "we have computed the cmb anisotropy spectrum due to the scalar and tensor subcomponents for a number of qcdm models , which we now present .",
    "figure [ figure3 ] shows the full cmb power spectrum predicted by inflation for tilted scdm and a qcdm model with a constant @xmath59 equation - of - state and @xmath60 , each with @xmath61 . in both panels the total spectrum",
    "is broken down into scalar and tensor components .",
    "it it noticeable that in the range @xmath62 the fractional contribution of the tensor spectrum to the total power is different in the two models .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] indicates how the @xmath0-component changes the shape of the tensor subcomponent of the power spectrum depending on @xmath34 for a set of constant equation - of - state models .",
    "the tensor power spectra in the first panel have been artificially normalized to @xmath63 to compare the shapes , demonstrating that the shape is not strongly affected by the change in @xmath34 . in the second panel ,",
    "the curves have been properly normalized with respect to cobe .",
    "here we see that the main difference is in the overall amplitude ; for increasing @xmath34 , the fractional contribution of the tensor spectrum decreases . in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , a similar set of panels demonstrates the effect of changes in @xmath49 on the tensor subcomponent .",
    "while the shape is not strongly affected , we see that for increasing @xmath49 , the fractional contribution of the tensor spectrum decreases .    in paper",
    "i , it was already noted that , even for purely scalar metric fluctuations , the cmb power spectrum at large angular scales ( low @xmath64 ) in qcdm models exhibits unusual features that do not occur in scdm or other conventional models .",
    "this is owing to a combination of the modification of cosmic expansion caused by @xmath0 ( that is , an integrated sachs - wolfe effect ) and the direct effect of fluctuations in @xmath0 . adding a tensor component can add to further features at low @xmath64 .",
    "we have discussed in section [ section3 ] how a very large class of qcdm models can be divided into two categories : ( 1 ) models in which @xmath34 is constant or monotonically increasing ; and , ( 2 ) models in which @xmath34 overshoots and then approaches or oscillates about an asymptotic value .",
    "we have computed the scalar and tensor components of the cmb anisotropy for representative models of each type for a wide range of parameters .",
    "we have used the numerical results to obtain a revision of the inflationary relation between spectral amplitudes and spectral indices .",
    "our results are expressed in terms of an empirical relation between the scalar spectral index @xmath5 and the ratios @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the quadrupole is a conventional choice ; we have also chosen @xmath67 because @xmath68 is only weakly - dependent on the cosmological model ( compared to @xmath69 ) when the predicted spectra are cobe - normalized , and so our relations can be applied more simply .",

    "we have described how boltzmann codes to compute the cmb anisotropy power spectrum and the mass power spectrum in qcdm models can be simply modified to incorporate the contribution of tensor metric fluctuations , as predicted by inflationary cosmology .",
    "we have demonstrated that a @xmath0-component has two important effects on the tensor component .",
    "first , by modifying the expansion history of the universe and , hence , producing an integrated sachs - wolfe contribution , a @xmath0-component changes the shape of the tensor anisotropy power spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) . secondly , since the same effect modifies the scalar component , but by a different factor , the ratio of tensor - to - scalar contributions to the cmb anisotropy is changed . the net result for",
    "any given tilt is to reduce the tensor contribution compared to scdm when spectra are cobe normalized ( see fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) .",
    "since the mass power spectrum is normalized by the scalar contribution to the cmb anisotropy , a consequence is that , for a given tilt , including the tensor contribution does not reduce the cobe normalization of the mass power spectrum as much as in scdm models .",
    "( however , as pointed out in paper i , the shape of the mass power spectrum in qcdm is changed and the small - scale power is reduced by other effects that do not occur in scdm models . )    finally , the inflationary relations linking the ratio of tensor - to - scalar multipole moments to the tilt ( @xmath5 ) must be modified .",
    "the most important results presented here are the generalized relations shown in the previous section .",
    "these relations provide the key test for inflation in future cmb anisotropy and polarization measurements , now extended to include qcdm models .",
    "assuming inflation is correct , the relations are also used in the fitting procedure to determine the hubble parameter , baryon density , and other cosmic parameters from the cmb anisotropy.@xcite the determination of cosmic parameters from cmb anisotropy measurements in qcdm models , including the effect of the new relations between spectral amplitudes and tilt , will be discussed in a forthcoming publication .",
