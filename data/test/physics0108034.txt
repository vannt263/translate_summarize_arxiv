    "handling noise in experiments is a challenging task for an experimenter during everyday work regardless of the field he or she is working on .",
    "any knowledge of the nature of the involved noise is important to understand experimental results .",
    "it may help to estimate the achievable precision to make out noise induced effects or to set up models for the experimental system under investigation . for a general application it is essential that these methods should require as little knowledge as possible of the system .",
    "in this paper we present evidence that it is possible for measured data , which were spoiled by different types of noise , to separate two basic types of noise and to measure their magnitudes . to show the quality of our method we apply it to the case of a noisy nonlinear chaotic dynamical system .",
    "obviously , this method also works for simpler dynamical situations , which are frequently given in experimental research .    before the early 80s complex , disordered systems were explained predominantly by stochastic models .",
    "the complex behavior of the dynamic was described by random motions .",
    "then it became clear that many of these disordered systems might be generated by low dimensional nonlinear _",
    "deterministic _ dynamics . for both kinds of systems a lot of refined methods for data analysis were developed , cf .",
    "complications in the data analysis based on this clear distinction arise if noise is present beside a nonlinear deterministic dynamics .",
    "two basic types of noise can be distinguished , namely , _ dynamical noise _ , which acts directly on the dynamics , and _ measurement noise _ , which is only added to the signal of the dynamics .",
    "thus , for the analysis of disordered systems it is one fundamental problem to characterize the type of noise and to quantify the amount of noise .",
    "recently , a method was proposed whereby dynamical noise and measurement noise can be measured very precisely , if the dynamical equations are known @xcite .",
    "our paper is devoted to the problem of unknown dynamics .",
    "it is our intention to show that it is possible by pure data analysis to clarify which kind of noise is present .",
    "furthermore , by using the theory of diffusion processes one is able to estimate the magnitude of dynamical and measurement noise .",
    "our proceeding is based on recent works @xcite showing that it is possible to reconstruct from given data the underlying stochastic processes and we want to point out that it is not founded on any previous knowledge given by models of the dynamic or by some assumed parameterizations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : first we describe the mathematics we are using for the reconstruction of the deterministic flow in phase space from given data sets .",
    "next it follows the criterion for the distinction between measurement noise and dynamical noise .",
    "we demonstrate that this method can be successfully applied to measured data of the chaotic shinriki oscillator , which are perturbed by different types of noise . at last",
    "we show that the signal of the dynamical noise and its correlation can be extracted from the measured data .",
    "this can be taken to examine the nature of the stochastic process and to verify the sufficient high embedding of a chaotic noisy system .",
    "based on the mathematics of diffusion processes it has recently been realized that by directly using the definition of the kramers - moyal coefficients @xcite it is possible to reconstruct the dynamics of the langevin equation from given data @xcite .",
    "this idea is the foundation of the following presentation .",
    "first we focus on the wide class of nonlinear dynamical systems with dynamical noise , also known as the diffusion processes .",
    "it can be represented by a langevin equation ( in the it representation),@xmath0_{ij}\\gamma_j(t)},\\;\\;i=1,\\ldots n \\label{langevin}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 denotes the time dependent @xmath2-dimensional stochastic state vector .",
    "the drift coefficients , @xmath3 , represent the deterministic part of the dynamics , and the diffusion coefficients , @xmath4 , determine the strength of the dynamical noise , including the general case of multiplicative noise when the coefficients @xmath4 depend on @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is @xmath7-correlated gaussian noise ( langevin force ) .",
    "as known from @xcite , the drift coefficients @xmath3 are obtained as the limit of conditional moments @xmath8 @xmath9 and the diffusion coefficients @xmath4 by the moments @xmath10 @xmath11 the numerical estimations of these conditional moments are performed for @xmath12 , for a sufficiently small neighborhood @xmath13 of a fixed value @xmath14 in the phase space .",
    "these conditional moments can be estimated directly from given data sets in a parameter free way . for small @xmath15 ( i.e. smaller than the recurrent time @xcite ) the first two moments @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) are connected to the diffusion coefficient @xcite : @xmath18    if , in addition to the dynamical noise , also measurement noise is present the procedure of the estimation of @xmath19 has to be changed .",
    "the measurement noise , which is typically added by the process of measuring data , can be formulated mathematically as @xmath20 the vector @xmath21 is the sum of the state vector @xmath22 described by the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) and measurement noise . here",
    "the measurement noise is given by its standard deviation @xmath23 and the @xmath7-correlated noise term @xmath24 .",
    "as a consequence of the definition ( [ measurement ] ) , it is easy to see that for @xmath25 the conditional moments , as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ drift2 ] ) and ( [ diffusion2 ] ) , one obtains @xmath26 note that for the determination of @xmath27 via @xmath28 ( see equation ( [ drift2 ] ) ) no correction term appears due to the measurement noise , because it averages out .",
    "the equation ( [ k2 ] ) is valid for a sufficient small neighborhood @xmath29 so that @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be approximated by constant values in @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore the linear dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath15 can be taken as a criterion for a correct sampling frequency , which has to be chosen so high that this linearity is resolved .",
