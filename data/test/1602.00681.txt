    "it is believed that mammalian ability to navigate , to escape from predators , to find its nest , to plan hunting strategies and so forth , is based on an internalized neuronal representation of space  a cognitive map of the environment @xcite .",
    "neurophysiologically , this map is encoded via timed sequences of quick electrical discharges of the neurons ",
    "neuronal spikes  in various parts of the brain . a particularly important role in producing this map",
    "is played by the hippocampus ",
    "one of the oldest parts of the mammalian brain in evolutionary terms .",
    "the spike times of the hippocampal principal neurons ",
    "so called place cells ",
    "are defined by the animal s spatial location : in rodents , each place cell fires when the animal visits a specific location ",
    "this cell s place field @xcite ( fig .  [ pfs]a ) .",
    "why a given place cell fires only when an animal is `` here '' rather than `` there '' is still a mystery , and how the ensemble of place cells forms a hippocampal map of the environment is equally mysterious . in particular",
    ", it remains largely unknown how the spike trains produced by the place cells are processed downstream from the hippocampus .",
    "experimental evidence points out that groups of coactive place cells form functionally interconnected `` assemblies '' @xcite that together drive their respective `` read - classifier '' or `` readout '' neurons in the downstream networks ( fig .",
    "[ pfs]b ) . since coactivity of the place cells marks the overlap of their respective place fields ( fig .",
    "[ pfs]c ) , the activity of a readout neuron actualizes a connectivity relationship between the regions encoded by the individual place cells .",
    "this suggests that the hippocampus provides a qualitative representation of space , based on connectivity , adjacency and containment relationships , i.e. , that the hippocampal cognitive map is topological in nature  a hypothesis that receives an increasing amount of experimental support@xcite .",
    "in @xcite we proposed a theoretical model that showed that hippocampal cell assembly network can indeed capture the spatial connectivity of the environment in a biologically plausible time , given that the place cells operate within biological parameters of firing rate and place field size .",
    "however , the approach of @xcite was based on analyses of the ever - growing pool of spike trains , i.e. , it ignored that , in physiological networks , the connectivity information may not only accumulate , but also decay .",
    "in particular , the physiological cell assemblies may not only form , but also disband as a result of deterioration of synaptic connections @xcite , then reappear as a result of subsequent learning , then disband again and so forth .",
    "electrophysiological studies suggest that the lifetime of the cell assemblies ranges between tens of milliseconds to minutes or longer @xcite , whereas spatial memories in rats can last for days and months @xcite",
    ". how can the large - scale spatial representation of the environment be stable if the neuronal stratum that computes this representation changes on a much faster timescale ?",
    "below we discuss a model of a transient hippocampal network and use methods of algebraic topology to demonstrate that the topological characteristics of the large - scale spatial representation of the environment encoded by this network can remain stable .",
    "the way place fields cover an environment @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ pfs]a ) calls to mind a basic theorem of algebraic topology due to p. alexandrov @xcite and e. ech @xcite : it is possible to reconstruct the topology of a space @xmath1 from the pattern of overlaps between the regions that cover it .",
    "the model proposed in @xcite is based on the observation that this theorem can not only be applied to the place fields themselves , but also implemented via spiking signals of cells that represent these place fields . in this approach ,",
    "groups of coactive place cells , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , ... , @xmath4 , are viewed as abstract simplexes , @xmath5 $ ] , which together form a simplicial `` cell assembly complex , '' @xmath6 ( for definitions and details see @xcite and methods in @xcite ) .",
    "this construction provides a connection between the local ( cellular ) and the global ( system - level ) scales : the individual cell assemblies , just like simplexes , provide local information about the space , but together , as a neuronal ensemble , they represent space as whole  as the simplicial complex .",
    "thus , @xmath6 provides a schematic representation of the cell assembly network and of its rewiring dynamics : formation of new place cell assemblies and disbanding of some old ones are represented , respectively , by the appearance and disappearance of their counterpart ( maximal ) simplexes in @xmath6 .     * place cells and cell assemblies*. ( * a * ) .",
    "simulated place fields in a small planar environment containing a square hole : dots of different color mark the locations where the corresponding place cells produced spikes . the dots of a particular color form spatial clusters  the place fields .",
    "( * b * ) .",
    "schematic representation of four overlapping third - order cell assemblies by four third order simplexes ( triangles ) .",
    "the vertexes ( shown by small circles ) represent place cells synaptically connected to their respective readout neurons ( pentagons ) .",
    "a cell assembly @xmath7 `` ignites '' ( red triangle ) when all of its place cells become simultaneously active , thus eliciting a response from the readout neuron @xmath8 ( active cells have colored centers ) .",
    "( * c * ) .",
    "a coactivity of the place cells @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath9 occurs when the rat crosses through the overlap of the corresponding place fields  the domain 123 . ]    on the other hand , the cell assembly complex @xmath6 provides semantics for describing the global spatial memory map in topological terms @xcite .",
    "for example , a sequence of cell assemblies ignited along a path @xmath10 navigated by the rat corresponds to a chain of simplexes @xmath11a `` simplicial path '' ( fig .",
    "[ schem ] ) .",
    "the structure of @xmath6 allows to establish certain qualitative properties of the simplicial paths and to relate them to the properties of the physical paths in @xmath0 .",
    "for example , a simplicial path that closes onto itself in @xmath6 may represent a closed physical path , a pair of topologically equivalent simplicial paths @xmath12 may represent physical paths @xmath13 and @xmath14 that can be deformed into one another , a hole in @xmath6 may represent a physical obstacle and so forth .",
    "however , establishing these correspondences requires learning : as the animal begins to explore the environment , only a few place cells would have time to ( co)activate , and only a few cell assemblies would have time to form ; as a result , a newly developing complex @xmath6 consists of only a few maximal simplexes and contains many holes , some of which correspond to physical obstacles or to regions that have not yet been visited by the animal , and others are `` spurious '' , i.e. , reflecting transient information about place cell coactivity . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the spurious holes tend to disappear as more spatial information accumulates .",
    "in @xcite we suggested two methods for constructing the cell assembly network and hence producing the simplicial cell assembly complex @xmath6 that represents this network , by selecting the most frequent combinations of spiking place cells .",
    "the key observation of @xcite was that in bounded environments , the coactive cell combinations eventually become repetitive , and it is therefore possible to identify the cell assemblies from the most frequent coactivity patterns .",
    "however , the frequency of a given cell assembly s activation , @xmath15 , was evaluated from the total number of its appearances over the entire navigation period , and then the selected cell assemblies were presumed to have existed for as long as the navigation continued .",
    "in other words , the cell assemblies were `` perennial '' by construction . in the following , we model a transient hippocampal network by limiting the time during which a cell assembly @xmath7 can form to a smaller time interval``a memory window '' @xmath16 .",
    "physiologically , @xmath16 defines the period during which readout neuron @xmath17 can identify the combination @xmath7 of coactive place cells , connect to it synaptically , retain these connections and respond to subsequent ignitions of @xmath7 .    to simplify the approach",
    ", we consider the case in which the entire ensemble of readout neurons is characterized by a single parameter @xmath18 , and proceed as follows .",
    "first , we identify the cell assemblies that emerge within the first @xmath19-period after the onset of the navigation , @xmath20 , and then repeat the algorithm for the subsequent windows @xmath21 , @xmath22 , ... , obtained by shifting the @xmath20 over small time steps . as a result , a cell assembly @xmath7 that was identified in the window @xmath23 , based on the local place cell coactivity rate @xmath24 , may disappear at a certain step @xmath25 , then reappear in a later window , @xmath26 , disappear again and so forth .",
    "the ensemble of appearing and disappearing cell assemblies can then be schematically represented by a `` flickering '' simplicial complex , @xmath27 , with appearing and disappearing maximal simplexes .",
    "our task is to study the net topological properties of @xmath27 , e.g. , whether the lifetimes of its topological loops can be longer than the lifetimes of its typical maximal simplex .",
    "* time evolution of the cell assembly complex*. ( * a * ) the number of maximal simplexes ( blue trace ) and the total number of all simplexes , scaled down by a factor of 10 ( red ) in the flickering simplicial complex @xmath27 .",

    "( * c * ) at every moment of time @xmath33 , the blue line shows the fraction of the maximal simplexes that were also present at the previous moment , @xmath35 .",
    "the green line shows the fraction of the original maximal simplexes ( from @xmath36 remaining in @xmath31 . the population of simplexes changes entirely ( by about @xmath37 ) in about 60 steps .",
    "the dashed line marks the mean simplex decay rate , @xmath38 window shifts ( about 25 seconds ) . ]",
    "we studied the dynamics of the flickering complex @xmath27 and the topological information encoded in it , as a function of the discrete time @xmath39 , @xmath29 secs , for the memory window width @xmath28 minutes .",
    "the results produced by a typical neuronal ensemble containing @xmath40 = 300 simulated place cells are shown on fig .  [ flick ] .",
    "first , we observe that the fluctuations of the number of the maximal simplexes in @xmath27 , @xmath41 , remain confined within about @xmath42 from the mean , @xmath43 , so that the simulated hippocampal network contains about 260 fluctuating cell assemblies on average ( fig .",
    "[ flick]a ) . however , while the size of the flickering complex remains bounded , the pool of the maximal simplexes changes significantly : as temporal separation @xmath44 between the memory windows increases , the corresponding complexes @xmath31 and @xmath32 become more and more dissimilar ( fig .  [ flick]b ) .",
    "after about 50 time steps ( @xmath45 120 seconds ) , the set of simplexes in @xmath27 is essentially renewed , which implies that the cell assembly network , as described by the model , is completely rewired ( fig .",
    "[ flick]c ) .",
    "a typical maximal simplex lasts on average about 10 discrete time steps ( @xmath46 seconds ) , which is close to the range of values established experimentally @xcite . such rapid rate of the simplex renewal in the flickering cell assembly complex allows us to address our main question : what is the dynamics of the topological characteristics of @xmath27 and how do they correspond to the topology of the environment ?    the topology of the environment can be described in terms of the betti numbers  roughly speaking ,",
    "a betti number @xmath47 defines the number of @xmath48-dimensional topological loops in @xmath27 ( i.e. , closed surfaces counted up to topological equivalence ) . in the case of the environment shown on fig .",
    "[ pfs]a , the betti numbers are as follows : @xmath49 ( i.e. , the environment is connected ) , @xmath50 ( i.e. , there is one @xmath51 topological loop that encircles the hole in the middle ) , while @xmath52 ( no topological loops in higher dimensions ) . using the methods of persistent homology @xcite",
    ", we evaluated these numbers for the flickering cell assembly complex for the sequence of windows , and found that @xmath27 does , in fact , reliably capture the topological properties of the environment over long periods , which significantly exceed both the simplexes lifetimes , @xmath53 , and the width of the memory window , @xmath19 .    as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ betti]a , the first and the second betti numbers almost never deviate from their respective physical values ( @xmath50 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "the occasional changes of @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be viewed as short - time `` topological fluctuations '' in the hippocampal map .",
    "for example , an occurrence of @xmath57 value indicates the appearance of an extra ( non - physical ) @xmath51 loop , and at the moments when @xmath58 , all @xmath51 loops in @xmath27 are contractible , i.e. , the central hole ( fig .  [ pfs]a ) is not represented in the hippocampal map .",
    "similarly , the moments when @xmath59 indicate times when the flickering complex @xmath27 contains non - physical , non - contractible @xmath60 bubbles ( one can speculate about the cognitive effects that these fluctuations may produce ) .",
    "the 0-th and the third betti number always came out correct , @xmath49 , @xmath61 , implying that despite the fluctuations of its simplexes , the cell assembly complex @xmath27 does not disintegrate into pieces and remains contractible in higher ( @xmath62 ) dimensions , i.e. , that the topological fluctuations in the hippocampal map are bounded to @xmath51 paths and @xmath60 surfaces .",
    "* stability of the topological information . *",
    "( * a * ) .",
    "the low - dimensional betti numbers , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath63 as a function of the discrete time , computed using 5 minute wide memory window @xmath19 .",
    "the 0th betti number ( @xmath49 at all times ) is not shown .",
    "( * b * ) .",
    "as the memory window decreases to @xmath64 minutes , the frequency and the number of the topological fluctuations increases : the flickering complex repeatedly produces an extra ( spurious ) @xmath51 topological loop and up to two spurious bubbles . ]",
    "further numerical analyses demonstrate that , as the memory window increases , the betti numbers @xmath55 and @xmath56 become more stable .",
    "in contrast , as the memory window shrinks , the fluctuations of the topological loops intensify ( fig .",
    "[ betti]b ) .",
    "this implies that if the characteristic timescale of the network s transience is sufficiently large , then the corresponding coactivity complex remains fixed and topologically equivalent to the `` perennial '' cell assembly complex , @xmath65 . on the other hand",
    ", if the simplexes are too unstable , then the cell assembly complex @xmath6 fails to acquire the correct physical structure , no matter how long is the learning period .",
    "in physical literature , fluctuating simplicial complexes have been previously used in the context of simplicial quantum gravity theories for discretizing quantum fluctuations of the space - time @xcite . a natural requirement for these theories",
    "is that the quantum fluctuations at the micro - scale should average out in the thermodynamic limit , yielding a smooth space - time continuum at the macroscale .",
    "there are certain parallels with cognitive representations of space that emerge from the spiking activity of neuronal ensembles . at the micro level ,",
    "the encoded spatial information is naturally discrete at the cellular level and allows a schematic representation in terms of simplicial complexes @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the various place cell assemblies that spike at different locations are transient structures , these auxiliary simplicial complexes fluctuate . on the macro level ,",
    "the emergent hippocampal maps provide a stable topological representation of the physical environment over long periods @xcite , enabling topological reasoning during animals spatial navigation @xcite .",
    "our model provides one explanation for how these two experimentally established aspects of hippocampal neurophysiology can coexist . according to the model , while the simplexes of the flickering simplicial complex @xmath27 fluctuate at the physiological timescale , its betti numbers can keep their physical values indefinitely . the fact that the simplex fluctuations can average out at the scale of the entire",
    "complex suggests that rapid rewiring of the cell assemblies can preserve the stability of the cognitive map as a whole .",
    "although these results were obtained using a simple computational model , we hypothesize that the observed effect reflects a more general phenomenon that might apply to physiological mechanisms of synaptic and structural plasticity in the hippocampal network .",
    "place cell spiking activity is modeled as a stationary temporal poisson process with a spatially localized rate @xcite that is characterized by the spatial location of the peak , @xmath66 , the peak firing amplitude , @xmath67 , and the place field size , @xmath68 .",
    "we simulated an ensemble of @xmath69 place cells with log - normally distributed peak firing amplitudes , with the mean @xmath70 hz , log - normally distributed place field sizes with the mean @xmath71 cm ( for details see methods in @xcite ) . spiking is modulated by the 8 hz @xmath72-oscillations  the basic rhythm of the extracellular field in the hippocampus @xcite .",
    "neuronal coactivity is defined as firing that occurred over two consecutive @xmath72 cycles  a computationally established optimal value @xcite , which corresponds to the parameters estimated from experimental data @xcite .",
