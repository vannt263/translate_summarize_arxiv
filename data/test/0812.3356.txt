    "the problem of analytic evaluations of definite integrals has been of interest to scientists since integral calculus was developed .",
    "the central question can be stated vaguely as follows : +    _ given a class of functions _",
    "@xmath1 _ and an interval",
    "_ @xmath2 \\subset \\mathbb{r}$ ] , _ express the integral of _",
    "@xmath4 _ in terms of the special values of functions in an enlarged class _ @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , by elementary arguments it is possible to show that if @xmath1 is the class of rational functions , then the enlarged class @xmath5 can be obtained by including logarithms and inverse trigonometric functions .",
    "g. cherry has discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite extensions of this classical paradigm .",
    "the following results illustrate the idea : @xmath6 but @xmath7 can not be written in terms of elementary functions and the logarithmic integral @xmath8 that appears in ( [ ex-1 ] ) .",
    "the reader will find in @xcite the complete theory behind integration in terms of elementary functions .",
    "methods for the evaluation of definite integrals were also developed since the early stages of integral calculus .",
    "unfortunately , these are mostly ad - hoc procedures and a general theory needs to be developed .",
    "the method proposed in this paper represents a new addition to these procedures .",
    "the evaluations of definite integrals have been collected in tables of integrals .",
    "the earliest volume available to the authors is @xcite , compiled by bierens de haan who also presented in @xcite a survey of the methods employed in the verification of the entries .",
    "these tables form the main source for the popular volume by i. s. gradshteyn and i. m. ryzhik @xcite .",
    "naturally any document containing a large number of entries , such as the table @xcite or the encyclopedic treatise @xcite , is likely to contain errors .",
    "for instance , the appealing integral @xmath9^{1/2 } } = \\frac{\\pi}{2 \\sqrt{6 } } , \\label{wrong}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 that appears as entry @xmath11 in @xcite , the sixth edition of the mentioned table , is incorrect .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath12 is @xmath13 and the right hand side of ( [ wrong ] ) is about @xmath14 .",
    "the table @xcite is in the process of being revised . after we informed the editors of the error in @xmath11 , it was taken out .",
    "there is no entry @xmath11 in @xcite . at the present time , we are unable to evaluate the integral @xmath12 .",
    "the revision of integral tables is nothing new .",
    "c. f. lindman @xcite compiled a long list of errors from the table by bierens de haan @xcite .",
    "the editors of @xcite maintain the webpage    ....",
    "http://www.mathtable.com/gr/ ....    where the corrections to the table are stored .",
    "the second author has began in @xcite a systematic verification of the entries in @xcite .",
    "it is in this task that the method proposed in the present article becomes a valuable tool .",
    "the _ method of brackets _ presented here , even though it is heuristic and still lacking a rigorous description , is quite powerful .",
    "moreover , it is quite simple to work with : the evaluation of a definite integral is reduced to solving a linear system of equations .",
    "many of the entries of @xcite can be derived using this method .",
    "the basic idea behind it is the assignement of a _ bracket _",
    "@xmath15 to any parameter @xmath16 .",
    "this is a symbol associated to the divergent integral @xmath17 the formal rules for operating with these brackets are described in section [ sec - bracket ] and their justification is work - in - progress , we expect to report in the near future .",
    "the rest of the paper provides a list of examples illustrating the new technique .",
    "given a formal sum @xmath18 we associate to the integral of @xmath19 a _ bracket series _ written as @xmath20 to keep in mind the formality of the method described in this paper .",
    "convergence issues are ignored at the present time .",
    "moreover only integrals over the half - line @xmath21 will be considered . + * note*. in the evaluation of these formal sums , the index @xmath22 will be replaced by a number @xmath23 defined by the vanishing of the bracket .",
    "observe that it is possible that @xmath24 . for book - keeping purposes , specially in cases with many indices , we write @xmath25 instead of the usual @xmath26 . after the brackets",
    "are eliminated , those indices that remain recover their original nature .",
    "+ the rules of operation described below assigns a _ value _ to the bracket series .",
    "the claim is that for a large class of integrands , including all the examples described here , this formal procedure provides the actual value of the integral .",
    "many of the examples involve the hypergeometric function @xmath27 this series converges absolutely for all @xmath28 if @xmath29 and for @xmath30 if @xmath31 .",
    "the series diverges for all @xmath32 if @xmath33 unless the series terminates .",
    "the special case @xmath31 is of great interest . in this special case and with @xmath34 ,",
    "the series @xmath35 converges absolutely if @xmath36 .",
    "the series converges conditionally if @xmath37 and @xmath38 and the series diverges if @xmath39 .",
    "the last section of this paper employs the method of brackets to evaluate certain definite integrals associated to a feynman diagram . from the present point of view , a _",
    "feynman diagram _ is simply a generic graph @xmath40 that contains @xmath41 _ external _ lines and @xmath42 _ internal _ lines or _",
    "propagators _ and @xmath43 _ loops_. all but one of these external lines are assumed independent .",
    "the internal and external lines represent particles that transfer momentum among the vertices of the diagram .",
    "each of these particles carries a _ mass _ @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "the vertices represent the interaction of these particles and conservation of momentum at each vertex assigns the momentum corresponding to the internal lines .",
    "a feynman diagram has an associated integral given by the _ parametrization _ of the diagram . for example , in figure [ figure0 ] we have three external lines represented by the momentum @xmath46 and one loop .",
    "the parameters @xmath47 are arbitrary real numbers .",
    "the integral associated to this diagram is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the evaluation of this integral in terms of the variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the _ solution of the feynman diagram_. the functions @xmath52 are polynomials described in section [ sec - feynman ] .",
    "the method of brackets presented here has its origin in quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "a version of the method of brackets was developed to address one of the fundamental questions in qft : the evaluation of loop integrals arising from feynman diagrams .",
    "as described above , these are directed graphs depicting the interaction of particles in the model .",
    "the loop integrals depend on the dimension @xmath53 and one of the ( many ) intrinsic difficulties is related to their divergence at @xmath54 , the dimension of the physical world .",
    "a correction to this problem is obtained by taking @xmath55 and considering a laurent expansion in powers of @xmath56 .",
    "this is called the _ dimensional regularization _ @xcite and",
    "the parameter @xmath56 is the _",
    "dimensional regulator_.    the method of brackets discussed in this paper is based on previous results by i. g. halliday , r. m. ricotta and g. v. dunne @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the work involves an analytic extension of @xmath53 to negative values , so the method was labelled ndim ( negative dimensional integration method ) .",
    "the validity of this continuation is based on the observation that the objects associated to a feynman diagram ( loop integrals as well as the functions linked to propagators ) are analytic in the dimension @xmath53 .",
    "a. suzuki and a. schmidt employed this technique to the evaluation of diagrams with two loops @xcite , @xcite ; three loops @xcite ; tensorial integrals @xcite and massive integrals with one loop @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an extensive use of this method as well as an analysis of the solutions was provided by c. anastasiou and e. glover in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of these studies is that the ndim method is inadequate to the evaluation of feynman diagrams with an arbitrary number of loops .",
    "the proposed solutions involve hypergeometric functions with a large number of parameters . by establishing new procedural rules i. gonzalez and i.schmidt @xcite and @xcite",
    "have concluded that the modification of the previous procedures permits now the evaluation of more complex feynman diagrams .",
    "one of the results of @xcite , @xcite is the justification of the method of brackets in terms of arguments derived from fractional calculus .",
    "the authors have given ndim the alternative name ibfe ( integration by fractional expansion ) .    from the mathematical point of view , the ndim method has been used to provide evaluation of a very limited type of integrals @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the examples presented in this paper show great flexibility of the method of brackets . a systematic study of integrals arising from feynman diagrams is in preparation .",
    "the literature contains a large variety of techniques for the evaluation of definite integrals .",
    "elementary techniques are surveyed in classical texts such as @xcite and @xcite . the text @xcite contains an excellent collection of problems solved by the method of contour integration .",
    "the reader will find in @xcite a discussion of several elementary analytic methods involved in the evaluation of integrals .",
    "it is hard to predict the type of techniques required for the evaluation of a specific definite integral .",
    "for instance , @xcite contains a detailed account of the proof of @xmath57 that appears as formula @xmath58 in @xcite .",
    "this particular example involves the use of @xmath43-functions @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a character .",
    "this is a generalization of the riemann zeta function @xmath61 ( corresponding to @xmath62 ) .",
    "vardi s technique has been extended in @xcite to provide a systematic study of integrals of the form @xmath63 that gives evaluations such as @xmath64 here @xmath65 is euler s constant .    a second class of examples appeared during the evaluation of definite integrals related to the hurwitz zeta function @xmath66 in @xcite the authors found an evaluation that generalizes the classical integral @xmath67 namely @xmath68 where @xmath69 is in ( [ l1-value ] ) and @xmath70 . the natural next step , namely the evaluation of @xmath71 remains to be completed . in @xcite and @xcite",

    "the mzv is given by @xmath79 where the parameter @xmath80 is called the depth of the sum .",
    "these series were initially considered by euler and have recently appeared in many different places .",
    "the reader will find in @xcite a description of how these sums are connected to knots and feynman diagrams .",
    "these diagrams are a very rich source of interesting integrals .",
    "the last section of this paper is dedicated to the evaluation of some of these integrals by the method of brackets .",
    "the computation of hyperbolic volumes of @xmath81-manifolds provides a different source of interesting integrals .",
    "mostow s rigidity theorem states that a finite volume @xmath81-manifold has a unique hyperbolic structure .",
    "in particular its volume is a topological invariant .",
    "an interesting class of such @xmath81-manifolds is provided by hyperbolic knots or link complement in @xmath82 .",
    "the reader will find information about this topic in the articles by c. adams and j. weeks in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that their hyperbolic structure can be given in terms of hyperbolic tetrahedra @xcite .",
    "milnor @xcite describes how the volume of these tetrahedra can be expressed in terms of the clausen function @xmath83 the reader will find in @xcite a discussion on arithmetic properties of @xmath81-manifolds . in particular , chapter 11 has up to date information on their volumes .",
    "zagier @xcite provided an arithmetic version of these computations in his study of the dedekind zeta function @xmath84 for a number field @xmath85 that is not totally real . here",
