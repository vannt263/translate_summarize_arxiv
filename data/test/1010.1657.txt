    "the quantum interference and coherence play the central role in the fields of nonlinear optics , quantum information processing , and quantum wells / dots etc . in recent years",
    ", the processes of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite are widely studied in various systems .",
    "many processes based on eit , for example , the electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) @xcite , the eit based four - wave and six - wave mixing @xcite , the eit for x - rays @xcite , and the eit on a single artificial atom @xcite are studied . also , the giant kerr effect ( gke ) @xcite is the natural application of eit by introducing the switching ( signal ) field , which has many applications , e.g. , in the photonic mott insulator @xcite and the circuit quantum electrodynamics @xcite etc .",
    "physically , once the dark state within the eit is destroyed by the disturbance of the switching field , the eit disappears , the nonlinear susceptibility and absorptive photon switching occur .",
    "the processes of eit and gke could be changeable by turning the switching field on and off , and the photon process within can be managed .",
    "recently , the effects of spontaneously generated coherence ( sgc ) ( or termed as vacuum - induced coherence ( vic ) ) stimulate one s interests .",
    "for instance , in three - level systems the nonlinear kerr absorptions are shown to be greatly enhanced via sgc @xcite . for four - level system ,",
    "the effects of sgc are studied in the @xmath1-type system @xcite on the nonlinear kerr absorption , and in double @xmath2-type system on the coherent population transfer @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it is effective to simulate the effects of sgc by changing the property of the vacuum @xcite , and/or extra driving fields , such as a dc field @xcite , a microwave field @xcite , or a laser field @xcite etc .",
    "some experimental groups have realized part effects of sgc in the @xmath3-type , four - level @xmath2-type , and other systems recently @xcite .    in the present work we study the effects of sgc in eit and gke in the four - level of @xmath1-type and double @xmath2-type systems based on the generating function approach",
    "developed recently @xcite . in the double @xmath2-type system",
    ", sgc can cause new eit channels due to destructive interference , which could be termed as `` vacuum - assisted transparency '' ( vat ) .",
    "the usual eit requires that the detunings of the coupling and probe fields satisfy the two - photon resonance condition . with the effects of sgc ,",
    "however , transparency can be obtained beyond the two - photon process .",
    "this means that we can get the transparency window within the whole detuning range of the probe field . for the nonlinear kerr absorption in the @xmath1-type system ,",
    "the spectra can be narrowed or eliminated with the effect of sgc , under different strengths of the coupling field @xmath4 and switching field @xmath5 .",
    "we demonstrate that the destroyed dark state can be repaired via sgc under some conditions . also , we investigate the photon switching process via photon statistics , the variance of the photon distribution can be presented by mandel s @xmath6 parameter",
    ". one of the important case is @xmath7 , which shows anti - bunching when photon switching occurs .",
    "for the four - level systems in this work , we demonstrate that sgc plays different roles in the linear and nonlinear absorption . by introducing sgc ,",
    "the ability of the original eit and gke can be improved , also the photon statistics can be greatly affected and reflect the characters of different dynamics .",
    "the reasons we investigate two type systems together are as follows .",
    "firstly , the two systems are , actually , the same with each other .",
    "they have the same structures , and a @xmath0 atom can be their concrete system . secondly , the @xmath1-type and double @xmath2-type systems are apparent type , their difference comes from the numbers of driving laser fields .",
    "sgc ( vic ) shows us another pathway of quantum interference , which serves to mediate the relative contribution of the dipole transitions , and represents the directly coupling between the coherence of the system .",
    "sgc ( vic ) , represented by the generalized decay constants ( gdcs ) , can lead to some novel features in dynamics of atomic systems , and it is shown that sgc plays the important role in many phenomenons @xcite , such as the dark state resonance @xcite , coherent population trapping and transfer @xcite , spectral narrowing and elimination @xcite , gain without population inversion @xcite , spectrum squeezing @xcite etc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "[ fig : eit1 ] ( c ) , we can see the two new eit channels along the @xmath66-axis for @xmath84 , and along the @xmath67-axis for @xmath85 in absorption line shapes .",

    "these two new eit processes are not the same with the usual eit ( the diagonal channel ) because they are assisted by sgc .",
    "we name them as the `` vacuum - assisted transparency '' ( vat ) .",
    "experimentally , for example , we can introduce another field @xmath91 between the excited states @xmath16 and @xmath15 to simulate the effects of sgc , the quantum system of the @xmath0 atom then seems to be `` locked '' by this field and the coupling field with @xmath92 , and the probe field can not disturb the @xmath0 atom and form the totally transparent window .",

    "when @xmath92 , for any @xmath66 there is no absorption of the probe field .",
    "the reason is that the population trapping happens .",
    "when the atom is excited ( except when the detuning @xmath85 ) , the population @xmath93 transfers to other three states , and they can not jump back to the ground state again due to influences of sgc .",
    "the trapping is controlled by the coupling field and gdcs .",

    "the population is almost trapped in the initial ground state ( @xmath98 in our calculation ) .",

    "@xcite , two close - lying excited states couple to another auxiliary state by a driving field , and decay to the single ground state . in our system ,",
    "the difference is that the coupling field and probe field can perform the eit channel , we can combine the effects of eit and sgc together , and switch between eit ( @xmath99 ) and vat ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "in addition , if the coupling field is turned off , there will be no transparency even though sgc exists .",

    "in this work we investigate the effects of sgc on the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and the giant kerr effect ( gke ) of four - level quantum system of the @xmath0 atom driven by external cw laser fields .    in our study , we show the structure of absorption line shapes in the detuning space for the double @xmath2-type system .",
    "the usual eit means that we can control the quantum system ( such as the @xmath0 atom ) by employing the strong coupling field , and there is no absorption when the weak probe field is introduced under the condition of two - photon resonance . with the effect of sgc ,",
    "there exist new eit channels , we note them as the  vacuum - assisted transparency \" ( vat ) .",
    "it means that we can use external fields to lock the system , so that there is no absorption when the probe field is introduced even beyond the two - photon resonance condition .",
    "the transparency window crosses the whole detuning range of the probe field .",
    "also , this could be more convenient to operate in experiment than the usual eit setup .",
    "the coupling field @xmath4 and the switching field @xmath5 play the different role in gke for the @xmath1-type system : the former one can inhibit the nonlinear absorption , while the later one can enhance it .",
    "if there exists sgc in the system , the nonlinear kerr absorption can be either narrowed or eliminated under different driven conditions .",
    "when the nonlinear absorption is completely eliminated , the dark state can be repaired by sgc .    for the photon statistics , several kinds of behaviors of mandel s @xmath6 parameter , such as the `` hole '' of the dark state , the steady anti - bunching of the photon switching , the transition between bunching and anti - bunching near resonance , and the big fluctuation due to sgc are also studied .",
    "based on this work , the dynamics of other type four level systems , such as the @xmath145-type , the inverse @xmath145-type systems can be investigated . also , this study will be of interest for further investigation in few photon processes , spontaneous emission cancellation , etc .",
