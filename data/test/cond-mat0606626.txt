    "the behavior of the @xmath1 rare earth metals and their compounds under pressure has been discussed for decades , with the volume collapse transition under pressure attracting a great deal of attention . it has been known for some time that there are volume collapse transitions in ce ( 15% at 0.7 gpa ) , pr ( 10% at 20 gpa ) , gd ( 5% at 59 gpa ) and dy ( 6% at 73 gpa ) , while no significant volume collapses have been detected in nd , pm , and sm .",
    "the equation of state of these metals , and references to the original work , has been collected by mcmahan _",
    "et al._@xcite high temperature experiments@xcite have seen signatures that are likely related to the localized@xmath3itinerant transition , at 50 gpa in nd and 70 gpa in sm .",
    "the question can be stated more generally as : what form does the localized @xmath4 itinerant transition of the @xmath1 states take , and what is the correct description ?",
    "this transition is intimately related to the question of behavior of magnetic moments,@xcite although the questions are not the same .",
    "there have been two main viewpoints on the volume collapse transition .",
    "one is the `` mott transition of the @xmath1 system '' elaborated by johansson,@xcite in which the crucial ingredient is the change from localized ( nonbonding ) to more extended states ( participating in bonding ) , with an accompanying drop in magnetic tendency .",
    "the other is the `` kondo volume collapse '' view introduced by allen and martin@xcite and lavagna _",
    "et al._@xcite , in which the main feature is the loss of kondo screening of the local moment , with a decrease in localization of the @xmath1 state not being an essential feature .    at ambient conditions the @xmath1 electrons form a strongly localized @xmath5 configuration that is well characterized by hund s rules . under reduction of volume",
    ", several things might be anticipated to happen . at some point",
    "the @xmath1 system begins to respond to the non - spherical environment .",
    "initially , perhaps , it is just a matter of crystal field splitting becoming larger .",
    "then the @xmath1 orbitals actually begin to become involved in the electronic structure , by overlapping orbitals of neighboring atoms .",
    "the consequences of this are possible participation in bonding , and that the orbital moment becomes less well defined ( the beginning of quenching _",
    "i.e. _ the loss of hund s second rule , which has already occurred in magnetic @xmath6 systems ) . additionally , the @xmath1 levels can shift and increase their interaction with the itinerant conduction ( @xmath7 ) bands ( kondo - like coupling ) , which can change the many - body behavior of the coupled @xmath8 system . at some point",
    "the kinetic energy increase , characterized by the @xmath1 bandwidth @xmath9 , compared to the on - site interaction energy @xmath10 reaches a point where the spin moment begins to decrease . finally , at small enough volume ( large enough @xmath9 ) the @xmath1 states simply form nonmagnetic conduction bands .",
    "just how these various changes occur , and in what order and at what volume reduction , is being addressed in more detail by recent high pressure experiments . here",
    "we revisit the case of gd , whose volume collapse was reported by hua _",
    "et al._@xcite and equation of state by akella",
    "_ et al._@xcite the deviation from the series of close - packed structures below p@xmath11=59 gpa and the lower symmetry bcm ( body - centered monoclinic ) high pressure structure signaled the expected onset of @xmath12-electron participation in the bonding , and hua _",
    "_ seemed to expect that the moment reduction and delocalization of the @xmath1 states would accompany this collapse .",
    "new information has been reported by maddox _",
    "et al._,@xcite who have monitored the resonant inelastic x - ray scattering and x - ray emission spectra of gd through p@xmath11 and up to 113 gpa .",
    "they find that there is no detectable reduction in the magnetic moment at the volume collapse transition , so the volume - collapse is only a part of a more complex and more extended delocalization process of the @xmath1 states .",
    "et al _ emphasize the kondo - volume - collapse@xcite aspects of the transition at p@xmath11 .",
    "the treatment of the @xmath1 shell , and particularly the volume collapse and other phenomena that may arise ( see above ) , comprises a correlated - electron problem for theorists .",
    "indeed there has been progress in treating this volume - collapse , moment - reduction problem in the past few years .",
    "the issue of the ( in)stability of the local moment seems to involve primarily the local physics , involving the treatment of the hybridization with the conduction bands and interatomic @xmath13 interaction , with kondo screening of the moment being the subsequent step .",
    "dynamical mean field studies of the full multiband system have been carried out for ce@xcite and for pr and nd.@xcite these calculations were based on a well - defined free - energy functional and included the conduction bands as well as the correlated @xmath1 bands .",
    "one simplification was that only an orbital - independent coulomb interaction @xmath14 was treated , leaving the full orbital - dependent interaction ( fully anisotropic hund s rules ) for the future .",
    "density functional based correlated band theories have also been applied ( at zero temperature ) .",
    "self - interaction corrected local density approximation ( lda ) was applied to ce , obtaining a volume collapse comparable to the observed one.@xcite four correlated band theories have been applied@xcite to the antiferromagnetic insulator mno .",
    "although their predictions for critical pressures and amount of volume collapse differed , all obtained as an s=5/2 to s=1/2 moment collapse rather than a collapse to a nonmagnetic phase .",
    "clearly there remain fundamental questions about how the magnetic moment in a multielectron atom disintegrates as the volume is reduced : catastrophically , to an unpolarized state , or sequentially , through individual spin flips or orbital - selective delocalization .",
    "if the latter , the total ( spin + orbital ) moment could actually _ increase _ initially in gd .",
    "if the occupation change is toward @xmath15 , the decrease in spin moment ( from s=7/2 to s=3 ) could be more than compensated by an orbital moment ( l=3 ) .",
    "if the change is toward @xmath16 , the onset of an l=3 orbital configuration could oppose the s=3 spin ( hund s third rule ) , leaving a non - magnetic j=0 ion ( as in eu@xmath17 ) even though the @xmath1 orbitals are still localized .",
    "still another scenario would be that the increasing crystal field quenches the orbital moment ( as in transition metals ) and the remaining problem involves only the spins .    our objective here is to look more closely at the stability of the gd atomic moment , in the general context of the localized@xmath4itinerant transition of the @xmath1 system under pressure .",
    "consideration of the changes in electronic structure under pressure go back at least to the broad study of johansson and rosengren@xcite but most have not considered the magnetism in detail .",
    "we apply the lda+u ( local density approximation plus hubbard u ) method to study the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetism as the volume is reduced .",
    "although this correlated band method neglects fluctuations and the dynamical interaction with the conduction electrons , it does treat the full multiorbital system in the midst of itinerant conduction bands .",
    "the resulting moment vs. volume surely provides only an upper limit to the pressure where the moment decreases rapidly .",
    "however , we can invoke studies of the insulator - to - metal transition in multiband hubbard models to provide a more realistic guideline on when the localized@xmath4itinerant ( or at least the reduction in moment transition within the @xmath1 system may be expected to occur .",
    "the results suggest stability of the moment to roughly the 500 gpa region .",
    "in the paper we apply the full potential local orbital code@xcite ( fplo5.00 - 18 ) to gd from ambient pressure to very high pressure ( a few tpa ) .",
    "we use the fcc structure with space group fm3 m ( # 225 ) and ambient pressure atomic volume ( corresponding to the fcc lattice constant a@xmath18=5.097 ) .",
    "the basis set is ( core)::@xmath19 .",
    "we use 48@xmath20 k point mesh and perdew and wang s pw92 functional@xcite for exchange and correlation .",
    "we have tried both 5.0 and 6.0 for the confining potential exponent , with very similar results , so only the results using exponent=5 will be presented here .",
    "we perform both lda and lda+u calculations ( see below ) . due to the extreme reduction in volume that we explore ,",
    "any band structure method might encounter difficulties . for this reason we have compared the fplo results on many occasions with parallel calculations with the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method wien2k.@xcite the results compared very well down to @xmath21=0.5 , beyond which the wien2k code became more difficult to apply .",
    "we use the notation @xmath22 for the specific volume throughout the paper .",
    "we assume ferromagnetic ordering in all calculations .",
    "the curie temperature has been measured only to 6 gpa,@xcite where it has dropped from 293 k ( p=0 ) to around 210 k. linear extrapolation suggests the curie temperature will drop to zero somewhat below 20 gpa . however , as the @xmath1 bands broaden at reduced volume the physics will change substantially , from rkky coupling at ambient pressure finally to band magnetism at very high pressure .",
    "antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering does not affect the @xmath1 bandwidth@xcite until @xmath13 overlap becomes appreciable .",
    "afm ordering might affect some of the quantities that we look at in this study at very high pressure , but such effects lie beyond the scope of our present intentions .      for the strength of the @xmath1 interaction we have used the volume",
    "dependent @xmath23 calculated by mcmahan _",
    "et al._,@xcite which is shown below . due to the localized @xmath1 orbital and the large atomic moment",
    ", we use the `` fully localized limit '' version of lda+u as implemented in the linearized augmented planewave method,@xcite and as usual the ratio of slater integrals is fixed at @xmath24=0.688 , @xmath25=0.495 . since we are particularly interested in the stability of the atomic moment , the exchange integral @xmath26 that enters the lda+u method deserves attention . in atomic physics , and in the lda+u method , the exchange integral plays two roles .",
    "it describes the spin dependence of the coulomb interaction , that is , the usual hund s rule coupling . in addition",
    ", it carries the orbital off - diagonality ; with @xmath26=0 all @xmath1 orbitals repel equally by @xmath14 , whereas in general the anisotropy of the orbitals leads to a variation@xcite that is described by @xmath26 .",
    "for a half filled shell for which the orbital occupations @xmath27 and @xmath28=0 for all suborbitals @xmath29 , the exchange effect primarily counteracts the effect of @xmath14 , since the anisotropy of the repulsion averages out . as a result ,",
    "using @xmath30 with @xmath31=0 is almost equivalent , for a perfectly half - filled shell , to using @xmath14 and @xmath26 separately as normally is done .",
    "since it could be argued that hund s first rule is treated adequately by the lda exchange - correlation functional , for our calculations we have set @xmath26=0 .",
    "this becomes approximate for the off - diagonality effects when the minority @xmath1 states begin to become occupied at high pressure .",
    "however , we have checked the effect at @xmath32=0.8 ( @xmath33 = 0.5 , @xmath34=60 gpa ) . comparing @xmath35 ev",
    ", @xmath26=1 ev with @xmath36 ev , @xmath26=0 , we find the energy is exactly the same ( to sub - mry level ) and the moment is unchanged .",
    "this result is in line with the @xmath37 argument mentioned above .",
    "changing @xmath26 from 1 ev to 0 with @xmath36 ev also leaves the energy unchanged , illustrating the clear unimportance of @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath26=1 ev calculation does result in a 0.03 @xmath38 larger moment . at much smaller volumes , where the minority bands overlap the fermi level ,",
    "the changes become noticeable and would affect the equation of state , but only in a very minor way . in general , neglect of @xmath26 will tend to _ underestimate _ the stability of the magnetic moment , which we show below already to be extremely stable .",
    "the observed structures of gd follow the sequence hcp@xmath3sm - type@xmath3dhcp@xmath3dfcc @xmath3bcm ( dfcc@xmath39distorted fcc , which is trigonal ; bcm@xmath39body - centered monoclinic ) .",
    "all except the bcm phase are close - packed arrangements , differing only in the stacking of hexagonal layers .",
    "the bcm phase is a lower symmetry phase that suggests @xmath12-electron bonding has begun to contribute .    for our purpose of studying trends relating only to the atomic volume , it is best to stay within a single crystal structure .",
    "we expect the results to reflect mostly local physics , depending strongly on the volume but only weakly on the long - range periodicity .",
    "therefore we have kept the simple fcc structure for the results we present .",
    "the overall result of our study is that evolution of the volume and the gd moment are predicted by lda+u to be continuous under reduction of volume , with no evidence of a volume - collapse transition ( or any other electronic phase change ) in the region where one is observed ( 59 gpa ) , or even to much higher pressure .",
    "this result provides some support for the suggestion that the volume collapse is kondo - driven , or involves in an essential way fluctuations , neither of which are accounted for in our approach .    while we will usually quote volumes or the relative volume @xmath33 , it is useful to be able to convert this at least roughly to pressure .",
    "we provide in fig .",
    "[ logpv ] the calculated equation of state , plotted as log @xmath34 vs. @xmath21 .",
    "it can be seen that the pressure is very roughly exponential in -@xmath21 from @xmath33=0.8 down to @xmath33=0.15 ( 2 gpa to 4 tpa ) .",
    "the change in slope around @xmath33=0.4 ( in the vicinity of 100 - 200 gpa ) is discussed below .      the behavior of the total spin moment ( @xmath1 plus conduction ) in lda+u is compared in fig . [ moment ] with that of lda .",
    "the general trend is similar , but the decrease in moment is extended to smaller volume by the correlations in lda+u .",
    "specifically , the moment is reduced not by decrease of majority spin population ( which would be @xmath41 ) but rather by increase in the minority spin population ( @xmath42 ; see discussion below ) .",
    "thus lda+u enhances the stability of the moment by raising the unoccupied minority @xmath1 states in energy , thus reducing and delaying compensation of the filled majority states .",
    "it has been noted elsewhere@xcite that raising the minority states is the main beneficial effect of the lda+u method for gd at ambient pressure .",
    "the decrease in moment is minor down to @xmath33 = 0.45 ( @xmath4390 - 100 gpa ) beyond which the decrease from 7@xmath38 to 6@xmath38 occurs by @xmath33 = 0.2 ( @xmath44 1 tga ) . only beyond this incredibly high pressure",
    "does the moment decrease more rapidly , as the @xmath1 states become band - like . even in lda",
    "this collapse does not occur until below @xmath33=0.3 ( @xmath45 300 - 400 gpa ) . with the neglect of fluctuations , the simplistic interpretation of the lda+u results",
    "is that the gd `` bare '' spin moment is relatively stable to @xmath431 tpa .    it might be thought that , for the region of spin moment of 6 @xmath38 and below , where the minority occupation is one or more , there might be an orbital moment of the minority system .",
    "however , at these volumes ( see below ) the minority @xmath1 bandwidth is 5 ev or more , which we think makes an orbital moment unlikely .",
    "therefore we have not pursued this possibility .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath1 states , which become bands , is better illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 4fpdos ] , where the evolution of the @xmath1 `` bands '' ( the @xmath1 projected density of states [ pdos ] ) is provided graphically . at @xmath32=0.80 ( @xmath33=0.51 , @xmath46 60 gpa , where the volume collapse is observed )",
    "the majority pdos is somewhat less than 2 ev wide and still atomic - like , since it does not quite overlap the bottom of the conduction band . above this pressure",
    "range the @xmath1 states begin to overlap the conduction bands , primarily due to the broadening of the conduction bandwidth . by @xmath32=0.70 ( @xmath33=0.34 ,",
    "@xmath46 200 gpa ) the width is at least 3 ev and the shape shows the effect of hybridization and formation of bands . for yet smaller volumes the bandwidth becomes less well defined as the bands mix more strongly with the conduction states and broaden .",
    "the minority pdos lies in the midst of gd @xmath47 bands and is considerably broader down to @xmath32=0.70 , beyond which the difference becomes less noticeable .",
    "the position of the @xmath1 states relative to the semicore @xmath48 , and conduction @xmath47 states , and their evolution with volume , are pictured in fig . [ eandw ] .",
    "the semicore @xmath48 bands broaden to @xmath4310 ev by 200 gpa , but it requires supra - tpa pressures to broaden them into the range of the majority @xmath1 states .",
    "the upturn in the log@xmath34 vs. @xmath49 curve in fig .",
    "[ logpv ] in the vicinity of 100 - 200 gpa is probably due to @xmath48 semicore overlap on neighboring atoms ( repulsion of closed shells as they come into contact ) .",
    "the @xmath47 bands broaden in the standard way under pressure , and begin to rise noticeably with respect to the @xmath1 states beyond 60 gpa .",
    "the minority @xmath1 bands fall somewhat with respect to e@xmath50 as they broaden , both effects contributing to an increase in the minority @xmath1 occupation at the expense of @xmath47 and @xmath51 character . since the majority @xmath1 states remain full , the effect is that the total @xmath12 count increases and the spin moment decreases ( as discussed above ) .    the volume dependence of the @xmath1 bandwidth in nonmagnetic gd has been looked at previously by mcmahan _",
    "et al._@xcite they identified the intrinsic width @xmath52 from the bonding and antibonding values of the @xmath1 logarithmic derivative ; @xmath52 lies midway ( roughly halfway ) between our majority and minority bandwidths , see fig .",
    "[ eandw ] .",
    "et al . _ also obtained a hybridization contribution to the @xmath1 width ; both of these would be included in our identified widths .",
    "our widths , obtained for ferromagnetically ordered gd , are difficult to compare quantitatively with those of mcmahan _ et al .",
    "_ , because the positions of our minority and majority states differ by 12 ev at p=0 , decreasing under pressure .",
    "note that our minority and majority widths , obtained visually from fig .",
    "[ 4fpdos ] differ by a factor of @xmath53 at @xmath33=1.0 , still by a factor of 2.5 at @xmath33=0.3 , and only become equal in the @xmath54 range .      in the simplest picture ( single - band hubbard model )",
    "the mott transition is controlled by the competition of kinetic ( @xmath55 ) and potential ( @xmath14 ) energies , with the transition occurring around @xmath56 .",
    "this transition is normally pictured as a simultaneous insulator - to - metal , moment collapse , and presumably also volume collapse transition .",
    "in gd , however , no change in moment is observed@xcite across the volume collapse transition at 59 gpa .    in fig .",
    "[ wvsu ] the @xmath1 bandwidths ( majority and minority ) and the coulomb @xmath14 of mcmahan _ et al._@xcite are plotted versus volume .",
    "the region @xmath56 occurs around @xmath570.20 - 0.25 .",
    "this volume corresponds to a calculated pressure in the general neighborhood of 1 tpa , indicative of an extremely stable moment well beyond present capabilities of static pressure cells .",
    "this criterion however presumes a simple single band system , which gd is not .",
    "gunnarsson , koch , and martin have considered the mott transition in the multiband hubbard model,@xcite and found that the additional channels for hopping favored kinetic processes that reduced the effect of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "they argued that the criterion involved the inverse square root of the degeneracy , which can be characterized by an effective repulsion @xmath58 ( for @xmath12 states the degeneracy is @xmath59 + 1 = 7 ) .",
    "the mott transition could then be anticipated in the range @xmath60 , for which @xmath61 has also been included in fig .",
    "taking w as the average of the majority and minority widths gives the crossover around @xmath620.35 ( @xmath63 200 gpa ) ; taking w more realistically as the majority bandwidth gives @xmath620.25 ( @xmath63 750 gpa ) .",
    "another viewpoint on the `` mott transition '' in the @xmath1 system is that it can be identified with the ` metallization ' of the @xmath1 bands , which might be expected to be where the occupied and unoccupied bands overlap .",
    "these are respectively the majority and minority bands .",
    "significant overlap occurs only above 2 tpa ( @xmath64 0.20 ) in fig .",
    "the fact is that metallization ( however defined for a @xmath1 system in the midst of uncorrelated itinerant conduction bands ) and moment collapse need not coincide , and the concept of mott transition may need to be generalized .",
    "in this paper we have applied the correlated band theory lda+u method to probe the electronic and magnetic character of elemental gd under pressure .",
    "the calculated moment decreases slowly down to @xmath21 = 0.20 ( @xmath65 1 tpa ) , and only at smaller volumes does the moment decrease more rapidly .",
    "still , no identifiable moment collapse has been obtained .",
    "metallization , defined as overlap of unoccupied with occupied bands , also does not occur until the same range of volume / pressure .",
    "however , information from studies of the multiband hubbard model , and comparison of the bandwidth to @xmath66 ratio ( @xmath67=7 is the @xmath1 degeneracy ) suggests a `` mott transition '' might be expected in the broad vicinity of 500 gpa .    the same lda+u method , and three different correlated band methods",
    "have been applied to antiferromagnetic mno .",
    "the manganese configuration is half - filled and fully polarized , as is gd , with the difference being that it is @xmath6 and an antiferromagnetic insulator rather than @xmath1 in a background of itinerant bands .",
    "all methods obtained a volume collapse from a high - spin to low - spin configuration .",
    "surprisingly , the collapse was not to nonmagnetic but rather to a spin - half result .    the critical pressures for transitions suggested by the present study ( minimum of 200 gpa , more likely around 750 gpa ) lie well above the volume collapse transition that is observed at 59 gpa .",
    "at this point in our understanding of the @xmath1 shell in gd , there seems to be no viable alternative to the suggestion by maddox _",
    "_ that gd provides an example of the kondo volume collapse mechanism.@xcite",
    "this work has benefited greatly from a number of exchanges of information and ideas with a. k. mcmahan .",
    "we have profited from many discussions on gd with c. s. yoo , b. maddox , r. t. scalettar , and a. lazicki , and on the moment collapse question with m. d. johannes and j. kune .",
