    "the atlas and the cms collaborations have reported observations of a new particle with a mass of about 126 gev , which is considered to be the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson  @xcite . if the particle is indeed the higgs boson , the sm inevitably involves the hierarchy problem .",
    "this unnaturalness indicates that there lies physics beyond the sm .",
    "there is another indication for physics beyond the sm .",
    "the precise measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( the muon @xmath1 )  @xcite has shown discrepancy from the sm prediction  @xcite . with dedicated efforts to determine hadronic contributions precisely , the latest result is @xmath2 where the hadronic vacuum polarization is quoted from ref .",
    "@xcite , and the hadronic light - by - light contribution is from ref .",
    "the muon @xmath1 anomaly indicates physics beyond the sm at more than @xmath0 level .",
    "moreover , the difference is as large as the sm electroweak contribution , @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "if new physics is responsible for the discrepancy , its contribution is naively estimated as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a coupling constant of new particles to the muon , and @xmath6 is a typical scale of their masses .",
    "thus , new physics around the tev scale is required to involve strong couplings with the muon in order to solve the muon @xmath1 anomaly .",
    "the supersymmetry ( susy ) is a promising candidate for the tev - scale new physics .",
    "the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) not only solves the hierarchy problem but also yields sizable contributions to the muon @xmath1  @xcite .",

    "superparticles are searched for at the lhc .",
    "since none of them has been discovered , colored superparticles are considered to be heavier than @xmath10  @xcite . moreover",
    ", the higgs boson mass of @xmath11 indicates the scalar tops to be as heavy as @xmath12  @xcite and/or to have a large trilinear coupling to the up - type higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "these two results naively contradict with the indication of the muon @xmath1 anomaly that superparticles have a mass of @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , some of the representative susy - breaking mediation mechanisms such as the minimal supergravity and the gauge mediation can not satisfy the above three phenomenological requirements simultaneously , ( i ) providing the higgs boson mass of @xmath11 , ( ii ) avoiding the constraints from the direct searches at the lhc , and ( iii ) solving the muon @xmath1 anomaly ( see ref .",

    "the above inconsistency implies a split mass spectrum of the superparticles as @xmath13 where the squarks are favored to be relatively heavy to explain the higgs boson mass and to satisfy the lhc bounds , while the sleptons , neutralinos and charginos are to be light to explain the muon @xmath1 discrepancy .",
    "this scenario forces us to change strategy of the susy search .",

    "[ sec : future ] .",
    "the first case is the one when the chargino  sneutrino contribution ( [ eq : whlnu_n ] ) dominates the susy contributions . as can be seen in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : whlnu_n])([eq : blr_n ] ) , this is valid when the relevant mass parameters of eq .",
    "are nearly degenerate .",
    "in fact , in wide susy models which explain the anomaly with non - decoupling higgsinos , the chargino  sneutrino contribution ( [ eq : whlnu_n ] ) dominates .",
    "as the higgsino mass @xmath17 increases , the chargino  sneutrino contribution decreases , while the neutralino ",
    "smuon contribution becomes relevant .",
    "this is because the pure - bino contribution eq .",
    "is enhanced under the presence of a large @xmath17 resulting in a large left ",
    "right mixing in the smuon mass matrix .",
    "the other contributions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : whsnu])([eq : bhmur ] ) are suppressed , where the higgsino propagates in the diagrams . in this situation , which we will take as the second case , the muon @xmath1 discrepancy is explained when both @xmath44 and @xmath45 are @xmath8 as will be seen in the next section .    in this letter , we will study the susy searches at the lhc for the parameter regions of these two cases .",
    "the soft susy - breaking parameters are set at the susy scale , and we will not specify the models to realize them .",
    "it is interesting to mention that such parameter regions are realized in wide susy models which solve the muon @xmath1 anomaly  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , in which much ingenuity is exercised in enhancing the higgs boson mass . as we take model independent approach , the following lhc analysis will be independent of the mechanisms which realize the higgs boson mass of @xmath11 .",
    "let us specify the mass spectrum to study lhc phenomena .",
    "we consider two representative cases in light of the muon @xmath1 : ( i ) the case when the chargino  sneutrino contribution to the muon @xmath1 dominates , and ( ii ) that with a large @xmath17 parameter where the neutralino  smuon diagram is relevant .",
    "the former contribution is controlled by @xmath46 , and the latter is by @xmath47 , according to eqs .   and , respectively . in particular , the @xmath17 parameter is favored to be relatively small in the former case , while it is fairly large in the latter .",
    "the leading susy contributions to the muon @xmath1 are proportional to @xmath15 , while the lhc sensitivities in the following sections do not depend much on it . mainly through the left - right mixing of the stau mass matrix .",

    "then , the lhc searches become easier .",

    "the following results do not change as long as the masses are large enough .",
    "note that lighter squarks just tighten the lhc constraints , because their productions contribute to the susy events .",
    "the remaining susy parameters are the cp - odd higgs mass , @xmath58 , and scalar trilinear couplings ( @xmath59-terms ) .",
    "they are relevant neither for the muon @xmath1 nor the susy searches at the lhc . in the analysis , they are fixed as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as a reference .      in the above parameter space , the lightest superparticle ( lsp )",

    ", a disappearing track at the lhc is expected to be observed .",
    "the track comes from the charged wino , which is almost degenerate with the neutral wino and decays into a neutral wino with a soft pion  @xcite .",
    "so far , we investigated the parameter regions where the susy contribution to the muon @xmath1 is dominated either by the chargino  sneutrino contribution or the pure - bino  smuon contribution .",
    "let us mention other possibilities .",
    "first of all , the contribution of eq .   can not take dominance , since it is always buried in that of eq .  .",
    "next , if the left - handed smuon is decoupled , only eq",
    ".   contributes to the muon @xmath1 , where the sign of @xmath155 is favored to be negative .",
    "lastly , eq .   becomes dominant if the wino and the right - handed smuon are decoupled . however , the contributions of eqs .   and are quantitatively small as shown in eqs .   and , respectively .",
    "thus , the superparticles must be very light , and the scenarios are expected to be examined by searching for the sm boson or di - lepton channels .",
    "the staus and the tau sneutrino were supposed to be decoupled from the lhc phenomenology .",
    "if their masses are comparable to those of the selectron and smuon , physics becomes much involved .",
    "attention must be paid to the vacuum stability conditions on the stau - higgs plane especially when @xmath17 is large , i.e. , in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ( d )  @xcite .",
    "the decay branching ratio of the higgs boson into the di - photon may be affected in such parameter spaces ( see the footnote [ footnote : stau ] ) . as for the direct searches for the superparticles ,",
    "since a stau tends to be light due to a large left - right mixing in the stau mass matrix , taus are likely to be produced in the decay chains of the superparticles .",
    "then the tau reconstruction becomes a central subject , which is one of the challenging topics of the lhc . because of the rich phenomenology ,",
    "these scenarios are worth investigated for future .",
    "finally let us relax our restriction of the lsp .",
    "we focused on the neutralino lsp to avoid the cosmological constraints .",
    "however , they can be circumvented if the lsp is a superparticle which is not in the mssm , such as the gravitino and the axino . in those cases ,",
    "charged particles or sneutrino can be the lsp among the mssm superparticles ( mssm - lsp ) , where the lhc signatures change correspondingly .",
    "if a sneutrino is the mssm - lsp , hard leptons are less produced because the left - handed charged sleptons are degenerate to the sneutrinos .",
    "although sneutrino decays into the lsp are not visible , the pair - production of the sleptons could be found by the mono - jet or mono - photon searches .",
    "in addition , this case might be checked by reconstructing soft particles that are produced by the quasi - degenerate charged slepton when it decays into the sneutrino .",
    "this search could be done at the ilc . on the other hand ,",
    "when the mssm - lsp is a charged slepton , it leaves a track in the detectors if it is long - lived , or generates a hard lepton when it decays .",
    "finally , if the lightest neutralino is the mssm - lsp and decays into the lsp in the detectors , the signature can be distinguished from the backgrounds by searching for events with multiple ( displaced ) photons .",
    "all of these possibilities and future sensitivities on them will be studied elsewhere .",
    "the susy not only solves the hierarchy problem between the planck and electroweak scales , but also explain the 34@xmath156 deviation of the muon @xmath1 .",
    "the latter suggests that superparticles have masses of @xmath8 , whereas the higgs boson mass of @xmath11 and the lhc results on the direct susy searches indicate that they exist in @xmath12 . in this letter",
    ", we examined the parameter regions where the muon @xmath1 is explained with squarks decoupled .",
    "the muon @xmath1 anomaly is solved when electroweak superparticles are light and @xmath9 .",
    "they are searched for by the lhc j- and l - searches .",
    "we found that the wino is constrained to be heavier than @xmath157 by the j - search under the approximate gut relation on the gaugino masses , and than @xmath158 by the l - search irrespectively of the gluino mass .",
    "in addition , if sleptons are produced by decays of charginos and neutralinos , the l - search provides a severe constraint , and the bound can be as tight as @xmath159 .",
    "consequently , the muon @xmath1 parameter space starts to be constrained by the lhc independently of details of the susy models .",
    "we also discussed future prospects on the collider searches for the superparticles which are relevant for the muon @xmath1 .",
    "a wide parameter region is expected to be examined at the 13@xmath133 lhc . in particular ,",
    "the sm boson channels of the electroweak superparticle decays such as the @xmath160 productions are promising for the study .",
    "however , the searches are challenging when the higgsinos are degenerate with the lightest neutralino , or if both of the wino and the higgsino are heavy .",
    "we need further studies to explore the whole parameter space where the muon @xmath1 anomaly is solved .",
    "the study in this letter is motivated by the muon @xmath1 anomaly .",
    "the @xmath161 deviation may originate in the uncertainties .",
    "currently they are dominated by those from the measurement and from theoretical calculation of the hadronic contributions .",
    "the former will be improved by the experiments at fermilab  @xcite and j - parc  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the uncertainty in the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution requires more experimental data for the cross section of @xmath162 , e.g. , at vepp-2000  @xcite .",
    "the evaluations of the hadronic light - by - light contribution have been improving ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , and lattice calculations are in development  @xcite .",
