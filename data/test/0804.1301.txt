    "it is remarkable , and at first sight surprising , that a large variety of physical , biological , financial , and other processes can be described by stable lvy processes with _ infinite _",
    "variance @xcite .",
    "the latter are defined as continuous - time random processes whose independent and stationary increments are distributed according to heavy - tailed stable distributions .",
    "the main feature of these distributions is that the tails can not be cut off or , in other words , rare but large events can not be neglected . as a consequence ,",
    "the classical stochastic theory , which is based on the ordinary central limit theorem , is no longer valid .    due to the heavy - tailed distributions of the increments ,",
    "stable lvy processes exhibit large jumps , and for this reason these processes are often called lvy flights .",
    "lvy flights are actually observed in various real systems .",
    "representative examples include , for instance , fluorescent probes in living polymers @xcite , tracer particles in rotating flows @xcite , ions in optical lattices @xcite , cooled atoms in laser fields @xcite , subsurface hydrology @xcite , and ecology @xcite , though a recent work questions the empirical evidence for lvy flights in animal search patterns @xcite .",
    "lvy flights have also been predicted for a large number of model systems @xcite .",
    "the ubiquity of these processes is supported by the generalized central limit theorem @xcite , which states that all limiting distributions of properly normalized and centered sums of independent , identically distributed random variables are stable .",
    "the langevin equation is one of the most important tools for studying noise phenomena in systems coupled to a fluctuating environment",
    ". introduced by paul langevin just one hundred years ago @xcite to describe the dynamics of a brownian particle , this equation and its various modifications are widely used in many areas of science @xcite . the langevin equation driven by lvy white noise , i.e. , noise defined as",
    "a time derivative , in the sense of generalized functions , of a stable lvy process , provides a basis for the study of lvy flights in external potentials .",
    "it has been shown that the probability density of lvy flights satisfies the fractional fokker - planck ( fp ) equation @xcite .",
    "the steady - state solutions of this equation describing _ confined _ lvy flights , i.e. , flights with finite variance , are of particular interest .",
    "one reason is that these solutions will clarify the distribution of flying objects in confined domains .",
    "this is an important issue , especially near impermeable boundaries , in such complex systems as confined plasmas and turbulent flows .",
    "another reason is that exact general solutions of a simple form , which are valid for _ any _ lvy white noise , will be very useful for testing a variety of numerical methods in this area @xcite .",
    "however , known solutions are related to power potentials and to a very special case of lvy white noise with unit index of stability and zero skewness parameter @xcite , and thus they are not suitable for those purposes .",
    "it should be noted that lvy white noises do not exhaust all possible white noises . as a consequence ,",
    "the fractional fp equation is a particular case of the _ generalized _ fp equation , which corresponds to the langevin equation driven by an _",
    "arbitrary _ white noise .",
    "since any white noise is defined as a time derivative , in the sense of generalized functions , of a stationary process with independent increments , it can be characterized by the transition probability density or , alternatively , by the characteristic function of this white noise generating process .",
    "one expects therefore that the term in the generalized fp equation that describes the effect of the noise on the dynamics of the system can also be expressed via the characteristic function .",
    "the derivation of the generalized fp equation is of great importance because it accounts for all possible white noise effects in a unified way and will be very useful for applications .    in this paper",
    ", we put forward the generalized fp equation and find the analytical solution of this equation for steady - state lvy flights in a confined geometry .",
    "in many applications , ranging from physical and chemical to biological and social systems , the relevant degrees of freedom of these systems obey a ( dimensionless ) langevin equation that is equivalent to the equation of motion for an overdamped particle @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is a particle coordinate , @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a force field , @xmath4 is an external deterministic potential , and @xmath5 is a random force ( noise ) resulting from a fluctuating environment .",
