    "it has been suggested that the neutrino - nucleon cross section , @xmath0 , can be enhanced by new physics beyond the electroweak scale in the center of mass ( cm ) frame , or above about a pev in the nucleon rest frame . at ultra - high energies ( uhe )",
    ", neutrinos can in principle acquire @xmath1 cross sections approaching hadronic levels .",
    "it may therefore be possible for uhe neutrinos to initiate air showers , which would offer a very direct means of probing these new uhe interactions .",
    "the results of this kind of experiment have important implications for both neutrino astronomy and high energy physics .    for the lowest partial wave contribution to the cross section of a point - like particle",
    ", this new physics would violate unitarity  @xcite .",
    "however , two major possibilities have been discussed in the literature for which unitarity bounds need not be violated . in the first , a broken su(3 ) gauge symmetry dual to the unbroken su(3 ) color gauge group of strong interaction is introduced as the `` generation symmetry '' such that the three generations of leptons and quarks represent the quantum numbers of this generation symmetry . in this scheme",
    ", neutrinos can have close to strong interaction cross sections with quarks .",
    "in addition , neutrinos can interact coherently with all partons in the nucleon , resulting in an effective cross section comparable to the geometrical nucleon cross section .",
    "this model lends itself to experimental verification through shower development altitude statistics , as described by its authors  @xcite",
    ". the present paper will not affect the plausibility of this possibility , which largely awaits more uhe cosmic ray ( uhecr ) events to compare against .",
    "the second possibility consists of a large increase in the number of degrees of freedom above the electroweak scale  @xcite .",
    "a specific implementation of this idea is given in theories with @xmath2 additional large compact dimensions and a quantum gravity scale @xmath3tev that has recently received much attention in the literature  @xcite because it provides an alternative solution ( i.e. , without supersymmetry ) to the hierarchy problem in grand unifications of gauge interactions .",
    "for parameters consistent with measured cross sections at electroweak energies and below , at @xmath4ev , the @xmath1 cross section can approach @xmath5 times a typical strong cross section  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in these models the mean free path for @xmath1 interactions at these energies is on the order of kilometers to hundreds of kilometers in air .",
    "experimentally , this would be reflected by a specific energy dependence of the typical column depth at which air showers initiate .",
    "as we will show , this leads to a useful signature , deriving from zenith angle variations with shower energy .",
    "comparison with observations would either support these scenarios or constrain them in a way complementary to studies in terrestrial accelerators  @xcite or other laboratory experiments that have recently appeared in the literature .    both scenarios for increasing @xmath1 cross sections raise the question of how far uhe neutrinos can travel in space . in the first case , due to the _ coherent _ nuclear interactions , the cross section approaches the nucleon - nucleon cross section , and so intergalactic matter becomes the greatest threat to the neutrino traveling long distances unimpeded .",
    "however , an order of magnitude calculation shows that the mean free path for such a neutrino is @xmath6  gpc , if we simply assume the matter density of the universe is its critical density . within a galaxy with similar interstellar density to the milky way ,",
    "the mean free path is @xmath7mpc ; the uhe neutrino is not attenuated before reaching earth s atmosphere . for the extra dimension model , the cross sections are lower , so interaction with matter is not a problem . with cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    "photons , the cm energy is too low to give rise to a significant interaction probability . if neutrinos are massive , then the relic neutrino background is more of a threat . but assuming the neutrino mass is below 92 ev , as conservatively required to prevent over - closing the universe for a stable species  @xcite , the mean free path is @xmath8  gpc at a cm energy of @xmath9gev , corresponding to a @xmath10ev neutrino . the cosmological horizon is only @xmath11  gpc , so for both scenarios the neutrinos can reach earth unhindered from arbitrarily great distances .",
    "a major motivation for attempts to augment the @xmath1 cross section at ultra - high energies derives from the paradox of uhecrs . above @xmath12  ev ,",
    "protons and neutrons see cmb photons doppler shifted to high energy gamma rays , and encounters generate pions , thereby reducing the resulting nucleon s energy by at least the pion rest mass .",
    "one therefore expects the greisen - zatespin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite , wherein cosmic rays above @xmath13  ev would lose their energy within @xmath14mpc .",
    "however , since we observe cosmic rays at super - gzk energies , it has been proposed that these uhecrs might really be neutrinos rather than nucleons ( for example , see  @xcite ) . while this is a strong motivation to explore new uhe neutrino interactions",
    ", we will not need to assume that uhecrs are neutrinos .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : in section  ii we derive a constraint on the neutrino - nucleon cross section resulting from the non - observation of horizontal air showers induced by neutrinos produced by interactions of the highest energy cosmic rays with the cosmic microwave background . in section",
    "iii we discuss potential improvements of this constraint including other hypothesized neutrino sources and next generation experiments . in section",
    "iv we narrow the discussion to the case of a @xmath1 cross section scaling linearly with cm energy , as an example .",
    "a zenith angle profile is presented as a signature of this scaling , and a means of constraining it .",
    "we conclude in section  v.",
    "the easiest way to distinguish extensive air showers ( eas ) caused by neutrinos from those caused by hadrons is to look for nearly horizontal electromagnetic showers . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the earth atmosphere is about 36 times thicker taken horizontally than vertically .",
    "a horizontally incident uhe hadron or nucleus has a vanishingly small chance of descending to sufficiently low altitudes to induce air showers detectable by ground instruments . as a consequence ,",
    "a horizontal shower is a very strong indication of a neutrino primary .    the two major techniques for observing extensive air showers produced by uhecrs or neutrinos are the detection of shower particles by an array of ground detectors , and the detection of the nitrogen fluorescence light produced by the shower .",
    "the largest operating experiment utilizing the first technique is the agasa which covers about @xmath15 in area  @xcite .",
    "the second technique was pioneered by the fly s eye instrument  @xcite and produced a total exposure similar to the agasa instrument . for cosmic neutrino detection",
    ", the fluorescence technique may provide somewhat more detailed information , because it can readily measure the position of the shower maximum and possibly the first interaction , which are important in distinguishing neutrino primaries .",
    "also , fluorescence detectors are equipped to see horizontal showers that do not intersect the ground near the detector .",
    "the main backgrounds consist of muon bremsstrahlung and tau lepton decays , as these could occur very deep in the atmosphere .",
    "the flux of these particles is several orders of magnitude below the crs and predicted neutrinos of the same energy , but if uhe neutrinos interact with matter only through standard model channels , then the rate of neutrino - induced triggers will still be dwarfed by these background events .",
    "the backgrounds for high zenith angle events differ somewhat between fluorescence detectors and ground arrays  @xcite , but both detector classes have remedies for the high background .",
    "for example , one interesting benefit with air fluorescence is the possibility of seeing a separate primary cr shower associated with the event , thus identifying it as a muon- or tau - induced secondary  @xcite .",
    "ground arrays would not see this sign , but they should be able to discriminate between neutrinos and secondaries by the shape of the shower front  @xcite .",
    "the strategy here is to use observations ( or non - observation ) of horizontal showers to place limits on the uhe neutrino flux incident on the earth . comparing that against a reliably predicted flux permits us to bound the cross section .",
    "[ flux ] summarizes the high energy neutrino fluxes expected from various sources , where the shown flavor summed fluxes consist mostly of muon and electron neutrinos in a ratio of about 2:1 .",
    "shown are the atmospheric neutrino flux  @xcite , a typical flux range expected for `` cosmogenic '' neutrinos created as secondaries from the decay of charged pions produced by collisions between uhe nucleons and cmb photons  @xcite , a typical prediction for the diffuse flux from photon optically thick proton blazars  @xcite that were normalized to recent estimates of the blazar contribution to the diffuse @xmath16ray background  @xcite , and a typical prediction by a scenario where uhecrs are produced by decay of particles close to the grand unification scale  @xcite ( for a review see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "apart from the atmospheric neutrino flux , only the cosmogenic neutrinos are nearly guaranteed to exist due to the known existence of uhecrs , requiring only that these contain nucleons and be primarily extragalactic in origin .",
    "this is an assumption , since galactic sources can not be wholly ruled out  @xcite . however , if the charge of the primary uhecr satisfies @xmath17 ( which will be tested by forthcoming experiments ) , an extragalactic origin is favored on the purely empirical grounds of the observed nearly isotropic angular distribution which rules out galactic disk sources .",
    "the reaction generating these cosmogenic neutrinos is well known , depending only on the existence of uhe nucleon sources more distant than @xmath18  8 mpc and on the relic microwave photons known to permeate the universe .",

    "the non - observation of horizontal showers by the neutrino fluxes indicated in fig .",
    "[ flux ] can now be translated into an upper limit on the total neutrino - nucleon cross section .",
    "the total charged current standard model @xmath1 cross section can be approximately represented by  @xcite @xmath23    in any narrow energy range and as long as the neutrino mean free path is larger than the linear detector size , the neutrino detection rate scales as  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the detector acceptance ( in units of volume times solid angle ) in that energy band , and @xmath26 is the neutrino flux incident on the earth . in our case ,",

    "this is about an order of magnitude shy of the cosmogenic flux at the same energy , and therefore it will not serve to improve the bound .",
    "however , should some new evidence arise against the existence of a cosmogenic flux , point source estimates like this may become the fallback means to constrain @xmath0 .",
    "in extra dimension scenarios , the virtual exchange of bulk gravitons ( kaluza - klein modes ) leads to extra contributions to any two - particle cross section . for cm energy such that @xmath70 , where possible stringy effects are under control  @xcite , these cross sections can be well approximated perturbatively . in contrast , for @xmath71 model dependent string excitations can become important and in general one has to rely on extrapolations which can be guided only by general principles such as unitarity  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , in a detailed analysis the observed shower energy has to be corrected by the distribution of fractional energy transfer @xmath116 in order to obtain the primary neutrino energy .",
    "this approach requires more data , which will likely come from the hires fly s eye and the pierre auger observatories . because these facilities can see nitrogen fluorescence shower trails in the sky , they are better equipped to see horizontal showers than ground arrays alone .",
    "in addition , they utilize more than one `` eye '' so their angular resolution is @xmath117  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "these detectors are biased toward horizontal events because of their long track lengths , and this bias will need to be treated properly in order to interpret the zenith angle data .    as mentioned above , `` traditional '' neutrino telescopes based on water and ice as detector medium could be used similarly to probe a range of smaller @xmath1 cross sections",
    "@xmath56 , if their size significantly exceeds 1 km and if they are sensitive to at least a limited range of zenith angles @xmath118 , i.e. above the horizon .",
    "for example , the ratio of upgoing to downgoing events in the @xmath119pev range could be a measure of the absolute @xmath1 cross section at these energies  @xcite .",
    "however , the detection method and flavor sensitivity are different in this case .",
    "it is worth considering whether enhanced cross sections in extra dimensions significantly raise detector backgrounds . here",
    ", the most important background for uhe neutrino detection is from muons created in decays of collision products of uhecr interactions in the atmosphere ( and to a lesser degree , from tau lepton decays ) .",
    "the muon range in centimeters of water equivalent , with only standard model interactions , is approximately  @xcite @xmath120 therefore , the uhe muon range is larger than the depth of the atmosphere ( see fig .",
    "[ reno ] ) . but",
    "with @xmath121  tev extra dimension models , the muon acquires a cross section given by eq .",
    "( [ sigma_graviton ] ) , and therefore has the same interaction rate in the atmosphere as the neutrinos we wish to detect .",
    "however , even if we conservatively estimate the atmospheric muon flux  @xcite , it is more than 350 times smaller than the cosmogenic neutrino flux at @xmath92  ev , and more than @xmath122 times smaller for @xmath123",
    "so with extra dimensions , atmospheric muons may lead to interesting signatures in atmospheric and underground detectors , but they do not hinder cosmic uhe neutrino shower identification .",
    "uhecrs and neutrinos together with other astrophysical and cosmological constraints thus provide an interesting testing ground for new interactions beyond the standard model , as suggested for example in scenarios involving additional large compact dimensions . in the context of these scenarios",
    "we mention that newton s law of gravity is expected to be modified at distances smaller than the length scale given by eq .",
    "( [ rextra ] ) . indeed , there are laboratory experiments measuring the gravitational interaction at smaller distances than currently measured ( for a recent review of such experiments see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which also probe these theories . thus",
    ", future uhecr experiments and gravitational experiments in the laboratory together have the potential to provide rather strong tests of these theories .",
    "these tests complement constraints from collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "a direct measurement approach has been presented here for bounding the extent to which uhe neutrinos acquire greater interactions with matter than the standard model prescribes . by looking for nearly horizontal air showers",
    ", we can limit the uhe neutrino flux striking earth . when this is combined with a natural source of cosmogenic uhe neutrinos , a model - independent upper limit on the cross section results .",
    "air shower experiments can also test for the energy dependence of cross sections in the range @xmath124 ; we have discussed the specific case of a linear energy dependence , as motivated by some large extra compact dimensions models that have enjoyed much recent attention in the community . in such scenarios ,",
    "fundamental quantum gravity scales in the @xmath125tev range can be probed .",
    "this could also be relevant for testing string theory scenarios with string scales in the tev range , however reliable theoretical predictions for the relevant cross sections in such scenarios are not yet available .",
    "if this method proves beneficial , knowledge will be gained about new interactions at ultra - high energies .",
    "should the data support extra dimensions , our understanding of uhe interactions between _ all _ particles ( not just @xmath1 ) will be changed because changes in gravity affect every particle . in general ,",
    "cosmic neutrinos and uhecrs will probe interactions at energies a few orders of magnitude beyond what can be achieved in terrestrial accelerators in the forseeable future .",
