    "cryogenically - cooled rare - earth - ion ( rei ) doped materials offer unique spectroscopic properties , such as narrow optical linewidths and long - lived shelving levels that allow for spectral tailoring of their inhomogeneously broadened absorption lines .",
    "these properties are required simultaneously in order to implement many of the potential applications of rei - doped materials , including optical quantum memories @xcite , as well as classical and quantum signal processing @xcite . compared to crystals ,",
    "the properties of rei s in amorphous hosts are generally very different because of the intrinsic disorder of the environment .",
    "this disorder comes with some advantages , in particular larger inhomogeneous broadening that is required for high - bandwidth or spectrally multiplexed applications .",
    "furthermore , the increased inhomogeneous broadening of electron and nuclear spin transitions can inhibit spin diffusion that leads to decoherence @xcite .",
    "this reduction was a key factor in our recent observation of efficient optical pumping into zeeman sublevels with spin lifetimes reaching 30  s in an erbium - doped fiber @xcite .",
    "however , in addition to long - term storage mechanisms , another prerequisite for the above - mentioned applications is a narrow homogeneous linewidth .",
    "rei - doped amorphous materials generally exhibit much larger homogeneous linewidths at liquid helium temperatures compare to rei - doped crystalline hosts due to interactions with dynamic fluctuations in the environment that are traditionally modeled as bistable two - level systems ( tls ) @xcite .",
    "motivated by our recent observation of slow spin relaxation @xcite in a weakly - doped erbium - doped fiber that has allowed storing members of entangled photon pairs @xcite , we now investigate coherence properties of such a fiber with special attention to the regime of low magnetic fields where long zeeman lifetimes were observed .",
    "more precisely , we report the magnetic field and temperature dependence of the optical coherence using two pulse photon echo ( 2ppe ) and three pulse photon echo ( 3ppe ) techniques .",
    "the fiber studied here has very similar composition and er - doping concentration as the one used in our previous studies @xcite .",
    "in particular , both fibers feature long - lived persistent spectral holes with very similar characteristics .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we discuss the results of the 2ppe measurements including the observed non - exponential echo decays in the context of spectral diffusion .",
    "we then present a detailed analysis describing the observed behaviors that combines elements from theoretical and semi - empirical models that have been developed in the past for glassy and crystalline hosts . in agreement with results of previous studies",
    "@xcite , we find that coupling with tls significantly limits the coherence lifetimes to less than 1 @xmath1s even at high magnetic fields and temperatures as low as 600 mk . however , an important new finding is that the best coherence properties exist at weak magnetic fields of around 0.05  t that also correspond to the optimal configuration for persistent spectral hole burning in this material @xcite .",
    "this result is highly desirable for applications requiring both long coherence times as well as long spin state lifetimes .",
    "our fiber ( ino canada , s / n 404 - 28565 ) features an er@xmath0 doping concentration of 80 ppm and a length of 25 m. it is cooled to a minimum temperature @xmath2  mk in an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator , resulting in an optical depth of @xmath3 at a wavelength @xmath4  nm .",
    "magnetic fields @xmath5 of up to 2  t can be applied by means of a superconducting solenoid .    to perform the 2ppe ( or 3ppe ) measurements ,",
    "we used two fiber - coupled electro - optic modulators to generate excitation pulses from a continuous wave external - cavity diode laser operating at @xmath4  nm . the light was then amplified using an erbium - doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) . in order to suppress spontaneously emitted and amplified light from the edfa , we filtered the output in polarization with a polarizing beam - splitter , in frequency with a 1  nm bandpass filter , and in time using an additional intensity modulator before sending the excitation pulses into the er@xmath0-doped fiber .",
    "the first pulse was 4  ns long , and the duration of the second ( and third in case of 3ppe ) pulse was 8  ns .",
    "all pulses emerging from the fiber were detected with an amplified photodetector ( newport ad-200xr ) . since any persistent",
    "hole - burning will affect the echo signal strength , we ensured that the repetition period of the experiment exceeds the characteristic ( magnetic field dependent @xcite ) persistence lifetime .",
    "k for @xmath6  t ( blue dots ) and @xmath7  t ( yellow dots ) .",
    "the pulse sequence is shown in the inset .",
    "the experimental data are fitted by a single - exponential function ( dashed lines ) with characteristic decay constants @xmath8 ns and @xmath9 ns . ]    the optical coherence properties of the fiber can be extracted from two - pulse photon echo measurements . in a 2ppe sequence , two short pulses , separated by a waiting time",
    "@xmath10 are sent into an inhomogeneously - broadened ensemble of absorbers .",
    "this gives rise to the emission of an echo at time @xmath10 after the second pulse .",
    "the variation of its intensity as a function of @xmath10 @xmath11 reveals the homogeneous linewidth @xmath12 ( which is inversely proportional to the coherence lifetime : @xmath13 ) assuming that all absorbers have the same coherence properties .",
    "[ fig : echo_decay ] shows typical examples of the echo intensity as a function of the pulse separation @xmath10 for @xmath6  t and @xmath7  t. the echo decays clearly show a non - exponential behavior : they deviate from a single exponential fit ( see dashed lines ) roughly at @xmath14s , and feature a slower decay after this point .",
    "this differs from what has been observed in previous investigations of coherence properties in er - doped fibers , where simple exponential decays were reported @xcite  most likely because the dynamic range of the echo decays was less in those past studies . in our case ,",
    "the experimental echo decays can be fitted by the sum of multiple exponential functions , which could suggest several classes of ions with distinct coupling strengths to their environment , or several distinct perturbing processes .",
    "that is not a likely explanation for an amorphous host where a random distribution of different site environments would be expected .",
    "ions in the center of the grey circle are perturbed by either direct interaction with fluctuations in the state of neighboring tls ( depicted on the right - hand side ) , or interaction with fluctuations in the state of other er@xmath0 spins in the local environment driven by tls or another er@xmath0 ion .",
    "inset : double - well potential - energy structure of the tls , with asymmetry energy @xmath15 , barrier energy @xmath16 and well separation @xmath17 . ]    due to the amorphous nature of the fiber , we expect a broad , continuous distribution of coherence - limiting processes to affect the er@xmath0 ions . of particular importance",
    "are changes in the local electric or magnetic field at the er@xmath0 ion position ; they result in time - dependent shifts of its optical transition frequency  so - called spectral diffusion  which is taken into account by using an effective homogeneous linewidth @xmath18 . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdscheme ] , these shifts can arise due to interactions with neighboring tls s ( or tunneling modes ) and er - spins , each having two states with a certain energy splitting and randomly fluctuating between those states at a certain local rate @xcite .",
    "two - level systems@xcite are intrinsic to amorphous materials and are present with a continuous distribution of flip rates @xmath19 and energy splittings @xmath20 that both depend on the asymmetry energy @xmath15 , well separation @xmath17 , and barrier energy @xmath16 ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : sdscheme ] ) , as well as on the magnetic field in certain cases ( so - called spin - elastic or magnetic tls s ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the calculation of the intensity of a 2ppe must include integration over a continuous distribution of rates and energy splittings : @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 is the intrinsic homogeneous linewidth ( without spectral diffusion ) , and the spectral diffusion linewidth @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the maximum possible linewidth broadening caused by spectral diffusion , @xmath27 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath28 the temperature @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the probability distribution for finding a tls with energy @xmath20 and flipping rate @xmath19 , @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30 with @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "in the case of interactions with a magnetic tls or the spin of another er@xmath0 ion , the energy @xmath20 is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the effective @xmath33-value for the perturbing tls or er - ion , @xmath34 the bohr magneton , and @xmath5 the applied magnetic field . using eq .",
    "[ eq:2peintensity ] , one can fit the echo decays individually with @xmath18 by including the sum of five individual processes : spectral diffusion due to direct interaction of the optically resonant er@xmath0 ions with a non - magnetic ( process 1 ) or magnetic ( process 2 ) tls ; spectral diffusion due to interaction of the optically resonant er@xmath0 ions with a pair of coupled er@xmath0 spins in the environment ( process 3 ) that randomly exchange spin states ( er@xmath0-er@xmath0 spin flip flops ) ; and spectral diffusion due to interaction of the optically resonant er@xmath0 ions with a non - resonant er@xmath0 spin that is strongly coupled to a magnetic ( process 4 ) or non - magnetic ( process 5 ) tls that drives spin flips ( i.e. er@xmath0-tls flip flops ) .",
    "due to the data set being limited in size and quality as well as computational complexity , we did not succeed in fitting all echo decays with one unique set of model parameters .",
    "however , as we will describe next , restricting the coherence - limiting processes to ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we were able to reproduce the magnetic field and temperature dependence of the single - exponential fits to our data shown in fig.[fig : echo_decay ] for the effective homogeneous linewidth @xmath35 .",
    "to extract the effective homogeneous linewidth as a function of magnetic field and temperature , we fit all measured echo decays using the single exponential function described in eq .  [ eq:2peintensity ] ( after replacing @xmath12 with @xmath18 ) .",
    "these fits describe the coherence data over the first decade of the decays , thereby restricting the assessment of coherence - limiting processes to that region of the data ; nevertheless , we should note that the first decade of the decay represents the dominant decoherence mechanisms that are primarily responsible for the performance in applications , with the different behaviors observed at longer times resulting from either higher - order processes and correlations or groups of minority ion sites in the material .     at @xmath36  k. the dashed lines shows the theoretical prediction of eq .",

    "[ fig : b - dep ] and [ fig : t - dep ] we plot examples of the experimentally obtained effective linewidth @xmath18 as a function of magnetic field for a fixed temperature and as a function of temperature for two different magnetic fields . in the case of varying magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b - dep ] ) , we observe two components .",
    "the first one is magnetic field independent and has been attributed to dephasing due to non - magnetic , or elastic , tls @xcite . at 0.7",
    "k its contribution to the er@xmath0 homogeneous linewidth in our fiber is roughly 0.75 mhz .",
    "the second component is magnetic field dependent : it dominates at small magnetic fields and is rapidly suppressed as the field increases .",
    "this behavior has been attributed to spectral diffusion due to the interaction of er@xmath0 ions with magnetic tls @xcite , or other er@xmath0 ions in the environment @xcite .",
    "the latter process is regularly observed in er@xmath0-doped crystals @xcite . in the region of low magnetic field",
    ", we observe a local minimum at @xmath39  t , followed by a local maximum at @xmath40  t. this behavior is similar to what has been observed in er@xmath0-doped crystals , such as er@xmath0:linbo@xmath41 and er@xmath0:ktp @xcite , and can be explained by the competition between two mechanisms : the interaction between er@xmath0 ions , which decreases with @xmath5 , and the interaction between er@xmath0 ions and resonant tls , which increases with @xmath5 according to the tls density of states @xcite .",
    "investigating @xmath18 at low and high magnetic fields as a function of temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t - dep ] ) , we observe that both components increase nearly linearly with temperature .",
    "this agrees with the characteristic behavior of tls - limited coherence @xcite , in which the effective linewidth is proportional to @xmath42 , with values of @xmath43 reported between 1 and 1.5 @xcite .",
    "next , we fit the effective linewidths using a model that takes into account the three processes described previously ( 1 , 3 , and 4 ) .",
    "our model combines what has been proposed for amorphous media @xcite and crystals ( in particular in the case of er : yso @xcite ) .",
    "we write the coherence lifetime as @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the homogeneous linewidth at @xmath46  k , @xmath47 is the constant describing the direct interaction with non - magnetic tls ( process 1 ) , and @xmath48 .",
    "the term @xmath49 represents the shortening of the coherence lifetime through spectral diffusion caused by magnetic dipole - dipole interactions with surrounding er@xmath0 spins , which are flipped by neighboring er - ions or tls ( processes 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the associated flipping rate @xmath19 can be described by @xmath50 the first term corresponds to spin flip - flops between er@xmath0 ions , with a coupling coefficient @xmath51 ( process 3 ) .",
    "we include broadening of the inhomogeneous linewidth @xmath52 of the spin transition with magnetic field , i.e. @xmath53 , with @xmath54 ghz and @xmath55 ghz / t , as observed in our previous work on spin relaxation in erbium - doped fiber @xcite .",
    "the second term corresponds to flip flops with magnetic tls , with a coupling coefficient @xmath56 ( process 4 ) .",
    "while this effect is in some ways analogous to the coupling with phonons in crystals , we observed in the same previous work that it is proportional to @xmath5 , i.e. does not have the same dependence on the magnetic field due to the difference in the density of states of the tls @xcite .",
    "the flip - flop rate increases with magnetic field for @xmath57  t , which opposes the reduction of the linewidth @xmath24 with @xmath5 , hence giving rise to the local maximum observed in the magnetic field dependence of the homogeneous linewidth ( see fig . [",
    "fig : b - dep ] ) .",
    "fitting eq .",
    "[ eq : model ] to the magnetic field and temperature dependence of the homogeneous linewidth @xmath35 results in the parameters listed in table  [ table : parameters ] .",
    "the values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 have been fixed to the values found in our previous investigation of 1.5 ghz and 150 ghz / t , respectively @xcite .",
    ".parameters resulting from the 2-dimensional fit of eq .",
    "[ eq : model ] to @xmath35 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the agreement between our model and the experimental data is exemplified by the data sets shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : b - dep ] and [ fig : t - dep ] .",
    "furthermore , the value of 1.1 for the exponent @xmath43 is in agreement with previous work @xcite , and the value of @xmath60 , while large , is within the allowed range from 0 to 18 for the @xmath61i@xmath62 levels of er@xmath0 ions @xcite .",
    "we also note that the rate of er@xmath0 spin flips , characterized by @xmath51 and @xmath56 , is on the order of mhz to ghz . however , our previous study of persistent spectral hole burning in a similar fiber established spin relaxation ( i.e. spin flip ) rates on the order of hz @xcite .",
    "we believe that this difference in behavior can be explained by the broad distribution of spin relaxation rates spanning the entire range from hz to ghz .",
    "the coherence lifetime is limited by spectral diffusion that occurs at the fastest rate whereas the possibility for persistent spectral hole burning is determined by er@xmath0 ions with the slowest rates ; in addition to causing spectral diffusion , the small fraction of rapidly relaxing ions leads the observed temperature - dependent limit on the maximum hole depth .",
    "overall , the coherence properties improve at low temperature and high magnetic fields , with an optimum of @xmath63  mhz at @xmath64  k and @xmath65  t ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : t - dep ] ) .",
    "however , the broadening of the effective linewidth at magnetic fields around of 0.05 t ( at which persistent spectral hole burning is possible ) is small enough to allow linewidths of approximately 1 mhz at @xmath64  k ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : t - dep ] ) .",
    "this property has not been previously observed @xcite , possibly due to differences in co - dopants ( phosphorus in our fiber and lanthanum in the fiber studied in @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting observation is that the value for @xmath45 predicts a very narrow linewidth for @xmath66  k. however , this is only an extrapolation of our observations down to @xmath67  k , and it is likely that other processes limit the linewidth to a constant value at lower temperatures .",
    "finally , to investigate spectral diffusion at timescales comparable to the excited - state lifetime of er@xmath0 ( 11 ms ) , 3ppe measurements were carried out at a temperature of @xmath68  k. we chose two values of the magnetic field : @xmath69  t for which the coherence lifetime exhibits a local maximum , and @xmath38  t for which the effect of spectral diffusion due to er@xmath0-er@xmath0 interaction is small and the coherence is limited by the interaction with tls . for these measurements , the separation time @xmath10 between the first two pulses was held constant at 50 ns and the echo intensity was measured as a function of the time @xmath70 between the second and third pulse , with @xmath70 varying between 0.001 ms and 35 ms .",
    "the echo intensity is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a scaling coefficient and @xmath73 the branching ratio from the excited - level ( with lifetime @xmath74 ) to the other zeeman sublevel of the ground state ( with lifetime @xmath75 ) @xcite .",
    "a fit to our data with @xmath76  ms yields the effective homogeneous linewidth @xmath18 that depends on @xmath10 and @xmath70 .    the measurement results are shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig:3ppe ] , which also includes fits of the expected logarithmic dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath70 due to coupling to tls in fiber @xcite : @xmath77 here , @xmath78 is the effective linewidth at the minimum value of @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is the coupling coefficient .",
    "the value of @xmath78 is set to the one we measured in the 2ppe at the same magnetic field .",
    "we find excellent agreement for @xmath81  mhz / decade at @xmath82  t and @xmath83  mhz / decade at 2 t. we find that , as in the case of short waiting times , our er@xmath0-doped fiber features better coherence properties for small magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore , effective linewidths at long waiting times barely improve when increasing the field to 2  t. this implies that spectral tailoring of the absorption profile with mhz resolution is possible even after large delays of up to hundreds of ms .",
    "in particular , this allows our fiber to be used as a quantum memory for light @xcite .    ,",
    "derived from 3ppe measurements at @xmath68  k at @xmath69  t ( empty circles ) and @xmath38  t ( filled circles ) .",
    "the experimental data is fitted by eq .",
    "[ eq:3ppe_intensity ] with @xmath81  mhz / decade and 0.410 mhz / decade at @xmath82  t and 2 t respectively . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have experimentally and theoretically investigated decoherence and spectral diffusion over a large range of timescales in an erbium - doped fiber similar to the one in which persistent hole burning has recently been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "our model combines the semi - empirical model framework developed for amorphous hosts , where spectral diffusion is caused by the interaction with two - level systems , and the theoretical framework successfully applied previously for er@xmath0-doped crystals , where spectral diffusion is due to er@xmath0-er@xmath0 magnetic dipole interactions .",
    "most importantly , we found coherence lifetimes at small magnetic fields , at which zeeman lifetimes can be as long as seconds , that are comparable to those at high magnetic fields .",
