    "the unprecedented fast re - pointing capability of swift @xcite has ushered in a new era in the study of gamma ray bursts ( grb ) sources . a canonical picture of the x - ray afterglow light - curve emerged ( see e.g. @xcite ) , with five different components describing the overall structure observed in the majority of events : an initial steep decay , a shallow - decay plateau phase , a normal decay , a jet - like decay component as well as randomly occuring flares .",
    "the steep decay phase smoothly connects to the prompt emission ( e.g. @xcite ) , with a typical temporal power law decay index between 2 and 4 @xcite : this strongly suggests a common physical origin .",
    "the observed spectral softening with time challenges the simplest version of the most popular theoretical model for this phase , the high latitude emission ( hle ) model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) : according to this scenario , steep decay photons originate from the delayed prompt emission from different viewing latitudes of the emitting area ( @xcite ) and are expected to lie on a simple power law ( spl ) spectral model .",
    "the @xmath4 spectrum of the steep decay phase is generally consistent with the expected spl behaviour with a typical photon index @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) ; however , a careful inspection of the grbs with the best statistics reveals that alternative explanations are required ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "deviations from the spl spectral model are therefore of particular interest .",
    "flares have been found to be a common feature of early x - ray afterglows : with a typical duration over occurrence time @xmath6 @xcite and a band spectrum @xcite reminiscent of the typical spectral shape of the prompt emission @xcite , they are currently believed to be related to the late time activity by the central engine . in spite of the growing statistics their origin is still an open issue .    in this paper",
    "we analyse and discuss how and if the extra soft ( @xmath0 ) steep decay emission of grb090111 fits into different theoretical models ; particular attention will be devoted to the possible link with the detected soft prompt @xmath7 emission .",
    "after the steep decay , the grb090111 @xmath4 light - curve shows a peculiar re - brightening , with extreme properties when compared to typical x - ray flares : alternative explanations are discussed .",

    "the spacecraft immediately slewed to the burst allowing the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) and the uv / optical telescope ( uvot , @xcite ) to collect data starting @xmath9 and @xmath10 after the trigger , respectively .",
    "a refined position was quickly available : r.a.(j2000)=@xmath11 , dec.(j2000)=@xmath12 with a 90% error radius of 1.7 arcsec @xcite .",
    "no source was detected by the uvot at the x - ray afterglow position @xcite .",
    "no prompt ground based observation was reported , probably due to the vicinity ( @xmath13 ) to the sun .",
    "the data were processed with the heasoft v. 6.6.1 package and corresponding calibration files : standard filtering and screening criteria were applied .",
    "bat data analysis was based on the event data recorded from -240 s to 960 s. xrt data were acquired in windowed timing ( wt ) mode until around 150 s ; after that time the xrt automatically switched to the photon counting ( pc ) mode to follow the decaying source photon flux . between @xmath14 @xmath15 pc data",

    "it can be fit using two @xcite profiles peaking at @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; the two structures are characterised by a @xmath19 rise and decay times @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and a width @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "places grb090111 at the boundary between x - ray rich ( xrr ) and x - ray flash ( xrf ) events according to the classification of @xcite .",
    "the bat data alone are not able to constrain the @xmath33 parameter ( peak energy of the @xmath2 spectrum ) : however , fixing the low energy photon index @xmath34 of a band model at @xmath35 ( typical value for both grbs and xrfs , see e.g. @xcite ) we derive @xmath36 . using the @xmath37 relation developed by @xcite we have @xmath38 , in agreement with the previous result .",
    "the x - ray light - curve ( fig.[fig : xrt ] ) exhibits a steep decay which is best fit by a simple power law with index @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 s ( @xmath42 s , peak time of the second prompt pulse ) .",
    "this is followed by a re - brightening which dominates the light - curve between @xmath43 and @xmath44 . during this time period",
    "no detection can be reported in the 15 - 150 kev energy range . after the re - brightening the light curve flattens to a simple power law index @xmath45 , while starting from @xmath46 the count rate decays as @xmath47 ( fig .",

    "we find two sets of allowed parameters : the first is for a close grb with @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) .",

    "such a high value suggests that this is the beginning of the tail of a flare whose onset was missed by the xrt .",
    "the spectral analysis leads to the same conclusion : out of 1242 time resolved xrt spectra of _",
    "swift_-grb in the time period april",
    "2005 - september 2008 , we found the existence of very soft absorbed simple power - law photon indices @xmath0 in grb050714b , grb050822 and grb060512 : in each of these cases , the soft spectral emission is linked to flare activity in the xrt light - curve .",
    "( the three bursts also show a soft bat prompt emission , with a time averaged 15 - 150 kev photon index @xmath97 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the comoving spectrum is likely to be a band spectrum whose @xmath3 evolves to lower values .",
    "both the bat prompt photon index steeper than 2 , and the xrt photon index @xmath98 steeper than the typical band low - energy photon index @xmath99 ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) suggest that in both cases the observed emission is dominated by the beta portion of the comoving band spectrum .",
    "it is interesting to note that fixing @xmath100 in the prompt spectrum we obtain @xmath101 at @xmath102 level for a high energy photon index @xmath103 which matches the unusual value of the high energy photons index measured in xrt .",
    "this establishes a spectral connection between the xrt steep decay and the prompt emission , provided that the @xmath3 had shifted well inside the xrt energy range by the beginning of the observation as found in other grbs and xrfs ( e.g. grb060614 , @xcite ; xrf 050416a , @xcite ) . at the same time the very soft emission observed",
    "extends the distribution in @xmath104 to very low values : only @xmath105 of the spectra of 156 batse grbs either have @xmath106 or do not have any high energy component ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    during the steep decay spectral evolution is apparent ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] , lower panel ) .",
    "we split the steep decay phase into two time intervals , taking @xmath85 as dividing line as suggested by the hardness ratio evolution .",
    "a simultaneous fit of the two spectra with an absorbed cut - off power - law model ( with @xmath3 as a free parameter of the fit ) shows that for each @xmath107 couple there exists a statistically acceptable solution with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the first ( @xmath110 ) and second ( @xmath111 ) time interval , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the detected spectral evolution can be linked to the evolution of the @xmath3 to lower values .",
    "it is worth noting that the higher temporal variability characterising the 1 - 2 kev signal in the first 100 s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ) disappears as the peak energy evolves outside the energy band .      interpreting the x - ray re - brightening as onset of the afterglow , it is possible to infer the initial lorentz factor @xmath112 of the fireball from the light - curve peak time ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for a homogeneous surrounding medium with particle density @xmath113 ,",
    "radiative efficiency @xmath114 we have @xmath115 . from @xmath83",
    "we derive an intrinsic peak energy @xmath116 and isotropic energy @xmath117 ( well within the 2@xmath118 region of the @xcite relation ) .",
    "this translates into a conservative upper limit @xmath119 : this is lower than what is commonly found for normal grbs ( @xmath120 , see e.g. @xcite ) , and consistent with the less - lorentz - boosted interpretation of xrrs and xrfs ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a similar result has been found for other xrfs : see e.g. xrf080330 @xcite .    in the context of off - axis emission ,",
    "it is worth noting that the x - ray re - brightening experienced by grb090111 is a sharp feature , reaching a flux contrast @xmath121 during a rising time of only @xmath122 .",
    "@xcite showed that both on - axis and off - axis decelerating jets can only produce smooth bumps in the afterglow emission .",
    "we therefore consider this hypothesis unlikely .    a much more likely explanation is suggested by fig . [",
    "fig : trisetdecay ] where the temporal properties of the grb090111 bat pulses and of the xrt re - brightening are shown to be consistent with the best fit relation found for the intrinsic properties of 32 0.3 - 10 kev early time flares ( chincarini et al .",
    "2009 , in prep . ) .",
    "this fact , together with the consistency with the typical @xmath123 @xcite found for prompt pulses , would suggest a common internal shock origin .    alternatively the bump could be due to refreshed shocks @xcite .",

    "it is apparent that the x - ray bump of grb090111 lies in the refreshed shocks region : density fluctuations are ruled out .",
    "grb090111 shows an extra soft @xmath0 steep decay emission .",
    "this is likely due to an intrinsic band spectrum whose low energy power law is missed because of the limited energy range of the xrt .",
