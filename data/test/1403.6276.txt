    "high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectra in the near uv is hard to obtain because of atmospheric extinction .",

    "the solar be abundance also seems to be largely insensitive to 3d hydrodynamical effects .",
    "the current value of the solar meteoritic abundance of be is a(be)(x ) = @xmath7 [ n(x)/n(h ) ] + 12 , i.e. an abundance by number in a scale where the number of hydrogen atoms is 10@xmath8 . ]",
    "= 1.32 @xcite while the photospheric abundance is a(be ) = 1.38 . nevertheless , most 1d lte model atmosphere analyses of be in the sun tend to find values between a(be ) = 1.10 and 1.15 .",

    "beryllium is not produced in significant amounts by the primordial nucleosynthesis , because there are no stable elements with mass number 5 or 8 to act as an intermediate step in synthesising @xmath0be @xcite .",
    "in addition , be is rapidly destroyed by proton capture reactions when in regions inside a star with a temperature above @xmath4 3.5 @xmath9 k @xcite .",
    "therefore , stars do not produce be .    in stars like the sun , for example ,",
    "be is only present in the external regions of lower temperature ( see fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in evolved stars , where the convective envelope has increased in size and mixed the surface material with the interior ,",
    "be , unlike li , is usually not detected .",
    "beryllium has never been detected in li - rich giants .",
    "long ago , it was understood that be can only be produced by the spallation of heavier nuclei , mostly from carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen @xcite .",
    "the only known way to produce significant amounts of be is by cosmic - ray induced spallation in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , as first shown by @xcite and .",
    "two channels of cosmic - ray spallation might work to produce be .",
    "in the so - called _ direct process _ , be is produced by accelerated protons and @xmath10-particles that collide with cno nuclei of the ism . in the _ inverse process _",
    ", accelerated cno nuclei collide with protons and @xmath10-particles of the ism .",
    "if the first channel dominates in the early galaxy , be should behave as a secondary element , as its production rate would be proportional to the metallicity of the ism .",

    "the two behaviors can be distinguished by the analysis of be abundances in metal - poor stars . for primary elements , one should observe a linear correlation between @xmath7(be / h ) and the metallicity [ fe / h ] = log [ n(a)/n(b)]@xmath11 @xmath12 log [ n(a)/n(b)]@xmath13 with a slope close to one . for secondary elements",

    "the determination of abundances of be in metal - poor stars were first attempted by and .",
    "but it was with the works of @xcite and @xcite that the linear correlation with slope of one became well established .",
    "beryllium abundances in metal - poor stars have been further investigated in several works since then .    with the inverse process dominating , and considering that cosmic - rays are globally transported across the galaxy , then the be production in the early galaxy",
    "should be a widespread process .",
    "it follows that , at a given time , the abundance of be across the galaxy should have a smaller scatter than the products of stellar nucleosynthesis ( such as fe and o ) , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite . in this case , be abundances could be used as a time scale for the early galaxy .",

    "the properties of cubes are still not finalized , but it will have a resolution of at least r = 20000 and should provide access to the wavelength range between 30004000  .",
    "cubes will be more efficient than uves @xcite in the near uv .",
    "uves ( ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ) is the current spectrograph at the vlt that is able to obtain high - resolution spectra in this region .",

    "most of the future new instruments and facilities ( such as the e - elt , european extremely large telescope ) are now being optimized for the red and near - infrared spectral regions .",

    "with respect to current eso instruments , cubes will outperform both uves and x - shooter .",
    "cubes should also be more efficient than other ground - based near - uv capable spectrographs , such as hires ( high resolution echelle spectrometer ) at the keck observatory and hds ( high dispersion spectrograph ) at the subaru telescope .",

    "if any kind of transfer of material from evolved stars ( which are depleted in be ) is involved , the surface abundance of be would be diluted .        whether the flattening exists or not is thus still not clear , because be abundances have been determined in only a few stars with metallicity around or below [ fe / h ] = @xmath123.00 ( see * ? ?",

    "a number of different scenarios could cause such flattening , each one with its own astrophysical implication .",

    "the identification of such a primordial plateau of be , similar to the one observed for li , might be an important test of the standard big bang model .",
    "other possibilities include : 1 ) the accretion of metal - enriched interstellar gas onto metal - poor halo stars , while crossing the galactic plane ( see @xcite @xcite for the case of beryllium , but see also @xcite @xcite for a more recent assessment of this effect on stellar metallicities ) ; 2 ) pre - galactic production by cosmic - rays in the intergalactic medium @xcite ; and 3 ) although a plateau is not predicted , be enriched stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath17 @xmath123.2 might be associated to population iii quark - novae @xcite .",
    "to address the existence of the flattening , it is important to expand the number of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath15 @xmath123.00 where be abundances have been determined .",

    "cubes will then offer an unique opportunity to obtain the spectra needed to test this possibility .    for this science case ,",
    "it is important to establish whether a sample of stars has be abundances at the level of a given plateau or whether the be abundances follow an extension of the linear relation between log(be / h ) and [ fe / h ] .",

    "that these peculiarities have a pristine origin , and are not the result of deep mixing inside the stars themselves , became clear when the same chemical pattern was found in turn - off stars .",
    "the most obvious observational result of mixing pristine and processed material is the appearance of the correlations and anti - correlations between light - element abundances .",

    "thus the polluting material from the first generation of evolved stars , regardless of the exact nature of the polluting star , is completely devoid of be .",
    "a star formed with only pristine material should have the original be abundance of that material .",
    "_ stars with different amounts of polluted material should have diluted the surface be abundance to different levels . _",
    "stars with bigger fraction of polluted material should have stronger correlations and anti - correlations between the light elements and should be strongly depleted in be .",
    "lithium abundances should in principle behave in a similar way .",
    "however , agb stars can produce li via the cameron - fowler mechanism @xcite .",
    "even though some extreme fine tuning might be needed to explain the full range of oxygen abundances in stars with seemly normal li , this option can not be completely excluded as of yet .",
    "in this situation , be offers an important complementary test .",
    "as be is never produced in stars , it is an unique tracer of the amount of pollution suffered by the globular cluster stars .    in this science case for cubes ,",
    "the objective is to detect differences in the be abundance among different turn - off stars of the same cluster .",
    "these different stars should have been polluted to different levels . if different be abundances",
    "are detected , then one can use them to quantify the fraction of polluting material . on the other hand ,",
    "if stars with different levels of pollution are found to have the same be abundance , this would definitely show that all the simple dilution - pollution scenarios currently proposed to explain the chemical properties of globular clusters are too simplistic and not valid .",
    "it would show that the true formation scenario was more complex than that .",
    "measurements of be abundances have been attempted in two globular clusters so far : i ) in ngc6397 , be was detected in two turn - off stars by , and an upper limit was derived for the extremely li - rich main - sequence star ngc6397 1657 and ii ) two turn - off stars in ngc6752 were analyzed by , resulting in one detection and one upper limit .",
    "the results seem to indicate that the stars have the same be abundance , even though they have different abundances of oxygen ( and thus were polluted to different levels ) . nevertheless , the results are uncertain due to the low s / n of the spectra ( s / n @xmath4 1015 ) , even though they were obtained with long total exposure time ( @xmath4 900 min ) .",
    "cubes will allow better spectra to be acquired with shorter exposure times , increasing also the number of globular clusters were be abundances can be investigated .    to test this science case , synthetic spectra of three different stars were computed .",
