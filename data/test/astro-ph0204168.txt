    "since the discovery of their period - luminosity ( p - l ) relation , at the beginning of the century ( leavitt @xcite ) , classical cepheids have played a central role as primary distance indicators .",
    "the reliability of this relation , however , depends on the accuracy of its calibration .",
    "this is done by using a handful of nearby cepheids , whose distances can be independently determined . due to the low - density distribution of the cepheids in our galaxy , however , this is a difficult task to accomplish .",
    "large errors still affect direct parallax measurements done with the hipparcos satellite ( see e.g. madore & freedman @xcite ) , and even future space - based surveys appear to suffer from the same limitations .",
    "recent progresses in ground - based , long baseline interferometry , however , have finally opened the possibility of direct measurements of nearby cepheids distances by using the so - called _ geometric _ baade - wesselink ( bw ) method ( baade 1926 , wesselink 1946 ) .",
    "a detailed description of this method and its implications for the accuracy of the zero - point calibration of the cepheid p - l relation is given in sasselov & karovska @xcite ( sk94 hereafter ) .",
    "the bw method relies on the accurate measurement of the cepheid diameter as the star pulsates . as such ,",
    "it can only be carried on with high angular resolution interferometric measurements .",
    "the vlti will be the ideal instrument for such measurements , given the available long baselines , and the large apertures allowing to reach fainter sources .",
    "however , to convert the measured vlti visibilities into accurate diameters , it is critical to use appropriate limb darkening models for different pulsational phases .",
    "as described in sk94 , the feasibility of the geometric bw method depends on the availability of accurate hydrodynamic models for the cepheid atmospheres , which are required to compute reliable time - dependent limb darkening profiles . in marengo",
    "@xcite ( mm02 hereafter ) we describe a new approach to compute detailed wavelength- and phase - dependent limb intensity profiles for pulsating cepheids . our profiles are based on time - dependent , non - lte hydrodynamic computations which , starting from a model of the cepheid pulsation , reproduce the dynamic structure of the stellar atmosphere as it pulsates ( see sasselov & lester @xcite ) . from these model atmospheres , we obtain the intensity emerging from the stellar photosphere ( and thus the limb darkening ) , computed for each pulsational phase relevant to the interferometric observations .",
    "this procedure can be applied to all cepheids for which a reliable pulsational model is available .",
    "figure  [ fig-1 ] shows the effects of non - lte hydrodynamics in the limb darkening of the classical cepheid @xmath0  gem .",
    "limb darkening appears to change with the pulsational phase and wavelength .",
    "the change is not only in the amount of limb darkening , but also in the shape of the limb profile .",
    "this shows that a single parametrization of the limb profile is not adequate for all pulsational phases .",
    "detailed time - dependent modeling is thus required for realistic limb darkening .",
    "our simulations show that the corrections introduced by the hydrodynamic effects and the wavelength dependence of the limb darkening in the diameter measurement , are of the order of a few percent at optical wavelengths . in the near - ir , which is the vlti primary domain , the corrections are of the order of @xmath12% , and are still sensitive to the effects of the pulsations .",
    "the high accuracy of the vlti visibilities , and the large spectral dispersion of the amber camera , will finally provide the high quality data necessary to apply the bw method . at the same time",
    ", vlti will allow the first direct testing of the atmospheric model themselves , improving our knowledge of the stellar atmosphere dynamics . to reach the full potential of the vlti , it is however necessary to take into account the corrections induced by limb darkening and its dependence from the pulsational hydrodynamics .    as the only long baseline interferometer below the equator , the vlti offers a unique opportunity to apply the geometric bw method to southern sources .",
    "vlti provides both the sensitivity and the angular resolution necessary to detect the radial variations of a sample of classical cepheids , to be used to calibrate the zero point of the p - l distance relation .",
    "the sensitivity required is of the order of mag 24 in the k band , for stars which are of mag 57 in the optical .",
    "such sensitivity can be easily achieved at the vlti by the near - ir camera amber , using a setup with three auxiliary telescopes , and large spectral resolution to isolate individual spectral lines .",
    "the typical expected diameters are of the order of @xmath2 mas , with a variation due to the stellar pulsation of about 10% of the diameter .",
    "this angular resolution can be reached with the vlti by using baselines of @xmath1100 m , or longer .    to - date",
    ", the angular diameter variations of classical cepheids have been measured only for two sources ( @xmath0 gem and @xmath3 aql , see lane et al .",
    "@xcite ; lane et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the vlti will give a substantial contribution in extending this sample , providing the necessary statistical significance for the recalibration of the p - l relation zero point with the bw method ."
