    "efforts to gain a quantitative microscopic understanding of melting have spanned more than a century .",
    "the lindemann criterion developed in 1910  @xcite describes melting in terms of the root mean square ( rms ) deviation from the atomic equilibrium positions .",
    "since long - range positional order stems from the periodic arrangement of atoms in crystalline solid , atomic deviations that are comparable to the separation between atomic species could obscure the regularity of the underlying crystal lattice with a concomitant loss of positional order .",
    "the lindemann criterion specifies that melting has occurred if the rms deviations reach on the order of a tenth of a lattice constant , and has proved to be a reasonably effective theory for three dimensional systems .",
    "the lindemann analysis does not take into account correlations of the motions of neighboring atoms .",
    "correlations are more important at lower dimensions , and the process of melting is hence strongly dimensionally dependent . while three dimensional crystals exhibit long - range order below certain temperatures , statistical fluctuations play a significant role in one dimensional systems , precluding all but short - ranged local ordering for @xmath0 .",
    "the process of melting in two dimensions is more subtle , and is understood in the modern context to occur in more than one stage .",
    "an initial continuous loss of positional order precedes the proliferation of lattice defects , which accumulate and eventually complete the melting process at sufficiently high temperatures by destroying even orientational order , where each atom has a fixed number of neighbors .",
    "thermally induced fluctuations in atomic positions can have an important effect on nano - engineered systems where structures may be on the atomic scale .",
    "atomic clusters or quantum `` dots '' are mesoscopic assemblies of atoms where the scale is confined in all directions .",
    "linear structures such as carbon nanotubes are essentially one dimensional objects ( although having cross sections on the atomic scale ) where the tube length may approach macroscopic scales . finally , two dimensional systems with nanoscale thickness such as covalently bonded graphene sheets are genuine monolayers with thicknesses on the atomic scale , but spanning macroscopic areas .",
    "the novel charge transport properties of graphene have been of intrinsic fundamental interest , and have also inspired scenarios for the use of graphene in semiconductor microprocessor applications .",
    "technological uses for graphene will need a stable planar substrate for the implementation of nano - circuitry , and fundamental scientific research will also benefit from the minimization of the amplitude of random undulations in graphene layers .",
    "we examine two dimensional crystals with properties that would generically be found in two dimensional covalently bonded crystals , including stiffness with respect to displacements perpendicular to the plane of the sheet .",
    "although we do not consider temperature regimes capable of disrupting the lattice topology or number of neighbors for each atom ( e.g. by thermal rupture of bonds between neighboring atomic species ) , we examine the loss of order caused by fluctuations of atomic positions about their equilibrium positions which nonetheless leave the bonding pattern intact .    if the motion of particles comprising the crystal is confined to the plane of the lattice , the gradual loss of long - range crystalline order with increasing system size has been understood as being in some respects similar to the destruction of ferromagnetic ordering in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model ( the motion of the spins are confined to the plane with a ferromagnetic coupling between them ) by thermally excited spin waves . nevertheless , on a detailed level",
    "the two systems differ . in the case of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , spin - spin correlation functions decay algebraically with the spatial separation between spins below the kosterlitz - thouless temperature for vortex unbinding . on the other hand ,",
    "the rms deviation in atomic positions in two dimensional crystals has been described as logarithmically divergent ( i.e. varying as @xmath3 $ ] where @xmath4 is a temperature dependent parameter ) for any finite temperature  @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we discuss theoretical techniques and the system geometries under consideration .",
    "then , in section iii we examine three dimensional lattices where we show directly for suitably rigid lattice geometries that the rms deviations from equilibrium converge to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit , an anticipated property of three dimensional systems .",
    "moreover , we determine a reference temperature threshold @xmath5 where mean square fluctuations about equilibrium reach one tenth of a lattice constant , corresponding to the melting point according to the lindemann criterion",
    ". this temperature will serve as a point of reference in the examination of two dimensional systems where thermal fluctuations disrupt long - range order for any finite temperature .",
    "however , although we find stable crystalline order in three dimensional geometries , we also discuss a significant caveat which applies for simple cubic lattices and other geometries which lack local stiffness . to a great extent ,",
    "the lattice geometries we report on are based on the two dimensional examples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig12 ] . a square lattice pattern , and a triangular lattice structure are shown .",
    "the former lacks inherent rigidity , but the square lattice gains local rigidity through the activation of an extended coupling scheme in which both nearest neighbors and next - nearest neighbors interact . in the same way , a simple cubic lattice requires interactions between next - nearest as well as nearest neighbors to resist thermal fluctuations and maintain long - range crystalline order .    by considering two geometries and appropriate three dimensional generalizations which differ in significant ways ( i.e. one base on a square pattern and the other assembled of triangles or tetrahedra joined at their corners ) , we identify generic thermodynamic characteristics common to both .",
    "square lattice extended coupling geometry with interactions with nearest and next - nearest neighbors ( left ) and the periodic triangular lattice and labeling scheme ( right ) ]    in section iv , we examine two dimensional lattices such as those shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig12 ] with motion confined to the crystal plane , finding the very slow ( i.e. logarithmic ) loss of crystalline order anticipated for two dimensional crystals . on the other hand , for a two dimensional crystal embedded in three dimensions , it is important to consider transverse perturbations tending to push atoms out of the plane .",
    "we find that in the absence of binding to a substrate , two dimensional crystals are much less able to resist extraplanar distortions than fluctuations which are confined to the lattice plane .",
    "in section v , we examine dual - layer systems where coupling between the crystal planes imparts local stability with respect to extra - planar variations of atomic positions in a caricature of physical systems ( e.g. sheets of graphene ) which have a finite thickness , and would be imbued with local stiffness .",
    "we find for two distinct locally rigid dual - layer geometries similar rapid divergences of mean square displacements as the crystal is made larger , corresponding to thermally induced rippling of the crystal , and scaling linearly with the size of the system .",
    "analysis of the density of vibrational states reveals that the length scale of the random undulations increases with the size of the system with strong long wavelength contributions . on the other hand coupling to a flat substrate , however weak , places an asymptotic upper bound on the ripple amplitudes and also limits the average wavelength of thermally induced undulations .",
    "we examine thermodynamic properties ( e.g. the mean square deviations of atoms about equilibrium positions ) for crystals with short range bonding in the regime where bonds remain intact and thermally induced lengthening and shortening of bonds is small relative to the unperturbed , or equilibrium , bond length . with individual bonds varying only slightly in length , it is appropriate to model the bonds as harmonic potentials so the couplings between neighboring atoms are effectively treated as springs connecting the two particles .",
    "it is important to note that although we neglect anharmonic effects from the bonds , the noncollinearity of bonds in the crystal geometry may in principle introduce anharmonic terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , at temperatures near and below the melting point , many scenarios are amenable to the harmonic approximation where the neglect of anharmonicities ( whether intrinsic or geometric ) has a small impact on the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "analytical results obtained in the context of the harmonic approximation are validated in the cases we consider by good agreement with monte - carlo calculations where the anharmonic characteristics of the bonding stemming from peculiarities of the lattice geometry are rigorously taken into account .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the equilibrium energetically favored bond length and @xmath8 is the instantaneous separation between atoms @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the outer sum is over the atoms in the ( finite ) crystal , and the inner sum is over the neighbors associated with the atom indexed by the label @xmath9 .",
    "the additional factor of 1/2 is included to compensate for double counting of bonds .",
    "the constant @xmath11 is the second derivative of the interatomic potential @xmath12 at the equilibrium separation @xmath7 .",
    "we develop the harmonic approximation directly from the bond length @xmath13 for the @xmath14 coordinates , it is convenient to write , for example , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the equilibrium coordinate and @xmath17 is the shift about equilibrium .",
    "we operate in the same way for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 coordinates , finding @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",

    "we also examine the effect of an attractive substrate coupling on the density of states profiles , and results are displayed in fig .",

    "a salient trend is the opening of a separation between the sharp cusp and the zero eigenvalue mark on the abscissa .",
    "the migration of the maximum formerly at the zero eigenvalue point to a peak at a larger eigenvalue is associated with a sharp reduction of the mean square fluctuations about equilibrium , and the lattice is better able to withstand transverse fluctuations .",
    "the presence of a flat substrate plays a very important role in dictating the overall structure and amplitude of ripples in the dual - layer geometries we report on here .",
    "this result is in accord with recent experiments on graphene sheets deposited on cleaved mica substrates  @xcite , where the careful preparation of flat substrates significantly dampens the ripple amplitude , whereas much larger undulations are seen with sheets attached to substrates with poorer control over the flatness .    to determine",
    "which length scales are associated with the strongest contributions to the thermally averaged mean square deviations about equilibrium , we have prepared histograms showing the relative contribution to @xmath85 versus inverse wave - vector magnitude , with the latter providing a length scale . apart from a significant diminution in the height of thermally excited undulations in the dual - layered sheets , we also find a considerable reduction in their typical wavelength . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig27 ] , for the dual - layer tetrahedral lattice in the absence of a substrate couplings , the dominant contribution to @xmath85 comes from large length scales comparable to the scale of the lattice .",
    "however the picture changes with the activation of a finite substrate coupling as may be seen in the inset with the peak height at the minimal wave - number decreasing with increasing @xmath179 .",
    "moreover , as may be seen in figure  [ fig : fig28 ] , introducing even a weak anchoring to the foundation below immediately creates a strong peak in the short wavelength regime , skewing the size of thermally induced ripples toward smaller length scales .     for the dual - layer square lattice in the extended scheme ,",
    "the main figure and the inset are graphs of mean square fluctuations versus system size @xmath70 for a range of substrate couplings @xmath179 , with @xmath179 given in units of the inter - planar and intra - planar coupling constant ( both equal to @xmath43 ) .",

    "we find rms fluctuations to increase at a very slow ( logarithmic ) rate when motion is confined to the lattice plane . on the other hand , when transverse motion is permitted , thermal fluctuations are very effective in bringing about significant vertical displacements of particles which contribute to rapidly growing deviations from equilibrium , and @xmath85 ultimately diverges at a linear rate in @xmath70 .",
    "the asymptotically linear divergence in the mean square deviations from equilibrium is insensitive to the strength of the interlayer coupling ; @xmath85 values appear to converge and eventually show identical behavior with increasing system size whether the coupling @xmath169 established between the layers to provide local stiffness is quite weak or very strong relative to the bonding @xmath43 between atoms in the same layer .    introducing a coupling @xmath179 to a flat substrate",
    "very effectively hinders transverse fluctuations in two dimensional crystal lattices , even in the coupling is very weak , and reflects the importance of a substrate in shaping the characteristics of ripples set up by thermal fluctuations by inhibiting transverse deviations .",
    "an attractive coupling to a fixed substrate also reduces the typical lateral length scale or wavelength of thermally excited undulations in lattices bound to a substrate .",
    "these tendencies are consistent with recent experimental observations that control over the flatness of the underlying surface is directly related to the amplitude and length scale of thermally induced ripples ."
