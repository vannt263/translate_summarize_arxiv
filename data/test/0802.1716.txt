    "it has been argued that large - scale electromagnetic fields of bright crab - like pulsars are properly described by force - free electrodynamics ( ffe ) ( gruzinov 2007 a ) .",
    "this allows to calculate the ideal pulsar magnetosphere ( contopoulos , kazanas , fendt 1999 , gruzinov 2005 , 2006 , spitkovsky 2006 ) .",
    "ffe is dissipationless . in ffe",
    "the entire spin - down power is carried by the large - scale poynting flux .",
    "formally , ffe predicts zero radiation .",
    "this appears to be a good approximation for crab - like pulsars  observed luminosity is indeed much smaller than the estimated spin - down power .",
    "radiation should come as a small dissipative correction to ffe .",
    "but of course , we must find a way to calculate these small dissipative corrections , because most of the pulsar data concerns radiation .",
    "one way to approach this problem is to first add dissipation to ffe and calculate the dissipative pulsar magnetosphere ( and then find the microscopic mechanism of the finite conductivity and the radiation counterpart of the dissipation ) .",
    "strong - field electrodynamics ( sfe ) , a dissipative extension of ffe , has already been formulated ( gruzinov 2007 b ) .",
    "it was shown that in the high conductivity limit , in the regions where the ideal ffe 4-current is space - like , sfe reduces to ffe with small dissipative corrections .",
    "on the other hand , in the regions where the current is time - like we found finite - time singularities . because of the singularities , we _",
    "erroneously _ concluded that sfe reduces to ffe only in the space - like current regions , and fails in the time - like current regions .",
    "the presence of singularities and the failure of the model are not equivalent .",
    "the singularities can be physical , like shocks and tangential discontinuities in hydrodynamics and current layers in ffe .",
    "indeed we will argue in this paper that sfe ( regularized by an arbitrarily small diffusion ) is well - defined everywhere .",
    "one may directly use sfe to study dissipation in ffe .",
    "in particular , it should be possible to use sfe to calculate the dissipative pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "it remains to be seen if sfe will be useful in calculating the pulsar radiation , but one thing is already clear .",
    "if sfe gives a correct description of dissipative corrections to ffe , the emission of bright pulsars must primarily come from the magnetic separatrix , where the 4-current is space - like ( and infinite in the ffe approximation ) .",
    "ffe describes electromagnetic fields of special geometry , with electric field smaller than and perpendicular to the magnetic field . in 3 + 1",
    "formulation , ffe is defined by maxwell equations with the ideal ohm s law @xmath0 covariant form of ffe is @xmath1 @xmath2 is the electromagnetic field tensor .",
    "ffe equations come from the following physics . at each event",
    "go to a _ good _ frame , where @xmath3 is parallel to @xmath4 . in ffe , in a _ good _ frame",
    ", the electric field actually vanishes and the current flows along the magnetic field .",
    "this physical formulation of ffe has been used to argue that ffe works for crab - like pulsars .",
    "sfe describes electromagnetic fields of arbitrary geometry . in 3 + 1",
    "formulation , sfe is defined by maxwell equations with the ohm s law @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xmath7 is the charge density , and the conductivity scalar @xmath8 is an arbitrary function of the field invariants .",
    "the covariant formulation of sfe is @xmath9 @xmath10 is the dual tensor .",
    "sfe equations come from the following physics . at each event , the _",
    "best _ of the _ good _ frames exists , where @xmath3 is parallel to @xmath4 and the charge density vanishes . in the _ best _ frame , the current @xmath11 flows along the magnetic field .",
    "the sfe ohm s law is dissipative , @xmath12  the electromagnetic energy damping is positive or zero in any frame .",
    "one can also show that ultraviolet modes propagate on or within the light cone .",
    "these good properties should be taken as an indication that sfe is well - defined .",
    "however , in ( gruzinov 2007b ) we found finite - time singularities for certain initial fields ( infinite second derivative of the electric field , to be discussed in  3.3 ) .",
    "we erroneously concluded that sfe fails for such initial fields .",
    "here we show that these singularities are physical , like shocks in compressible hydrodynamics .",
    "it appears that sfe is actually well - defined .",
    "we have confirmed this by a large number of numerical simulations of sfe , which showed no pathologies , in the sense that the evolution of the field was independent of the regularization .",
    "the most straightforward regularization was used in maxwell equations ( realized as the lax scheme in numerical simulations ) : @xmath13 the sfe ohm s law needs regularization only in the regions where both invariants of the electromagnetic field vanish .",
    "we have used the following regularization when calculating @xmath14 and @xmath15 : @xmath16 and then calculated @xmath15 and @xmath14 from unmodified expressions @xmath17 the regularization of the @xmath18 function is arbitrary .      to show both regularizations in action ,",
    "consider one - dimensional charge relaxation .",
    "that is take an initial field @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "then only the x - component of the electric field @xmath21 will be non - zero , and sfe equations reduce to @xmath22 where dot and prime are the time and @xmath23 derivatives . here and below , we take @xmath24 .    it is easy to show that equation ( [ rel ] ) gives finite - time singularities near the extrema of @xmath21 .",
    "say there is a positive maximum of the initial field at @xmath25 .",
    "then at all time @xmath26 , the taylor expansion near @xmath25 is @xmath27 with positive @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and equation ( [ rel ] ) gives @xmath30 it follows that @xmath29 becomes infinite in a finite time . at this moment",
    "the second derivative of @xmath21 becomes infinite .",
    "but so what ? the regularized ( according to  3.2 ) sfe equations keep working as shown in fig .",
    "1 . in fact",
    ", we also see that singularities immediately form near the electric field zeros .",
    "the electric field zeros develop into zero - field regions bounded by electric field singularities ( again infinite second derivative of the field ) .",
    "the electric field dies out in a finite time , even if the conductivity is zero . in sfe",
    ", the damping rate @xmath31 can be positive even for zero conductivity @xmath32 .",
    "generic 1d sfe describes electromagnetic fields @xmath33 , @xmath34 , where all components are functions of @xmath23 and @xmath35 .",
    "we ran many simulations of 1d sfe .",
    "it appears that sfe ( regularized according to  3.2 ) works in 1d .",
    "it is interesting to see what happens to 1d ffe equilibria in the sfe description .",
    "the field @xmath36 is an ffe equilibrium .",
    "we used the field ( [ ffeeq ] ) as an initial condition for numerical sfe .",
    "it was found that equilibria with the space - like 4-current @xmath37 decay , and the decay rate decreases with the increasing conductivity @xmath32 .",
    "it was also found that equilibria with the time - like 4-current , @xmath38 , are not damped at all .",
    "the origin of this _ semi - dissipative _ behavior is clear . in the space - like case , a non - zero parallel electric field is needed to sustain the current .",
    "the dissipation rate @xmath39 is then positive . the dissipation rate decreases for increasing @xmath32 ,",
    "because for a given space - like current , @xmath40 decreases .    in the time - like current regions , the parallel electric field oscillates around zero , giving a time - like time - averaged current .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations is infinitesimal , and the dissipation @xmath39 vanishes .",
    "we checked , for example , that a space - like ffe equilibrium @xmath42 , @xmath43 is damped and the damping rate goes down for increasing @xmath32 .",
    "we also observed formation of zero - field regions and infinite second derivatives for a spherically symmetrical pure electric field ."
