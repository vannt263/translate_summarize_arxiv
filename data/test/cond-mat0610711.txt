    "it is well - known @xcite that the instability in electron gas due to magnetic interaction between conduction electrons in diamagnetic metals at high magnetic field and low temperature leads to formation of non - uniform diamagnetic phase , so - called condon domains , which is usually realized as a stripe - domain structure for plate - like samples .",
    "the diamagnetic domains were observed in beryllium by magnetization measurements @xcite and in silver by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite and by hall probes spectroscopy @xcite . they have been observed in beryllium , white tin , aluminium and lead by muon spin - rotation ( @xmath1sr ) spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned instability of an electron gas is called diamagnetic phase transition and is extensively studied , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recent progress in experiments on observation of condon domain structure in silver @xcite and beryllium @xcite-@xcite provides a natural stimulus towards a more detailed understanding of the properties of strongly correlated electron gas at the conditions of dhva effect .",
    "undoubtedly , silver and beryllium are the most popular metals in experimental investigation of electron instability leading to formation of condon domain structures .",
    "the direct observation of condon domains in silver by hall probe spectroscopy @xcite shows that the temperature and magnetic field dependencies of non - uniform phase are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted phase diagrams ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , estimated on the basis of the lifschitz - kosevich - shoenberg formalism in the first harmonic approximation @xcite .",
    "however , in case of beryllium , the standard approach , which gives the satisfactory results for free or almost free electron gas , fails to describe the diamagnetic phase transition , and , leads , in particular , to the _ underestimated _ values for critical temperature @xmath2 and magnetic field @xmath3 , which is inconsistent with the experimental data @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thus , for proper calculation of amplitude of the dhva oscillations and constructing the phase diagrams , the correct topology of fermi surface has to be taken into account .",
    "recent experimental observation of irreversible effects in beryllium by hall probes in dc field and standard ac method with various modulation levels , low frequencies and magnetic field ramp rates @xcite , as well as application of non - linear techniques @xcite , which reveals giant parametric amplification of non - linear response in condon domain phase , offer the possibility to construct the diamagnetic phase diagrams for beryllium and compare it with theoretical predictions .",
    "the fermi surface of beryllium was investigated very carefully in the past @xcite .",
    "paradoxically , beryllium has the simplest fermi surface , because it differs essentially from the free electron model .",
    "the fermi surface of beryllium consists only of the first and second zone monster ( coronet ) and the third zone cigar. it is well - established that the dhva oscillations originates from the three maximum cross - sections of cigar ( waist and hips ) which are characterized by a very small curvature .",
    "the small curvature of the cylinder like fermi surface explains relatively high amplitude of dhva oscillations in beryllium at magnetic field h applied parallel to the hexagonal axis , e.g. @xmath4 $ ] , in comparing to silver @xcite , where the small amplitude of dhva oscillations is explained in the framework of spherical fermi surface @xcite providing the reasonable agreement between estimated phase diagrams @xcite and experimental data @xcite .",
    "a new experimental results @xcite-@xcite on observation of condon domain phase in beryllium stimulate the further development of the theory .",
    "undoubtedly , for correct explanation of experimental data @xcite-@xcite the anomalously low curvature of the cigar like part of fermi surface of beryllium near the extreme cross - sections ( waist and hips ) has to be taken into account .",
    "the modeling of cigar - like part of the fermi surface of beryllium @xcite by a cylinder , similar to 2d electron gas , describes correctly the diamagnetic phase diagrams at low range of quantizing magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) , but results in the essentially _ overestimated _ values of critical parameters ( temperature @xmath2 and magnetic field @xmath3 ) at higher values of applied magnetic field . in particular , the models based on approximation of relevant fermi surface sheets by cylinder predict the existence of inhomogeneous phase at the values of external magnetic field @xmath6 contradicting to the experimental data @xcite-@xcite that show the disappearance of condon domain structure above @xmath7 at the values of dingle temperature @xmath8",
    ". moreover , the approximation of fermi surface of beryllium by cylinder @xcite fails to explain the observed beatings in the dhva oscillations @xcite,@xcite-@xcite , which are the result of the interference of the signals from two different extreme cross - sections of fermi surface @xcite with close fundamental frequencies .",
    "solt @xcite shows the serious disagreement of @xmath1sr data in beryllium with the phase diagrams , calculated in the framework of standard lifshitz - kosevich formula , and necessity to take into consideration the actual 3d fermi surface geometry for beryllium , first , the existence of two different cross - sections ( waist and hips ) , and second , the low curvature of fermi surface near extreme cross - sections .",
    "the model developed in @xcite-@xcite is more realistic ; it describes correctly the beating effect in dhva oscillations in beryllium , and it is consistent with the previous experiments on observation of condon instability @xcite at low range of quantizing magnetic field ( till @xmath9 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the high values of critical magnetic field @xmath10 for non - homogeneous phase , estimated in the framework of model @xcite , contradict to recent data on independent observation of condon instability in beryllium @xcite-@xcite , which demonstrate the existence of non - uniform phase in essentially narrow interval of quantizing magnetic field ( @xmath11 ) depending on estimated dingle temperature @xmath8 .",
    "in present paper we develop the model of slightly corrugated cigar - like fermi surface for beryllium and calculate the diamagnetic phase diagrams t - h at different dingle temperatures @xmath12 .",
    "the estimated phase diagrams are in good agreement with the available experimental data on observation of diamagnetic instability in beryllium @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section i is an introduction . in section",

    "section iv is conclusions .",

    "the cross - sectional area of the fermi surface @xmath22 at @xmath23 in @xmath24-space is related to the quantity @xmath25 by the relationship @xmath26 where @xmath1 is the chemical potential and @xmath27 is the phase correction ( typically , it equals to 1/2 ) .    the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : free energy density ] ) is a fresnel - type .",
    "its major contributions come from regions where the phase is stationary @xcite , e.g. the cross - sectional area @xmath22 has maximums or minimums .",
    "the usual procedure of calculation of such an integral consists in expanding of electron orbit area @xmath22 about the extreme points and summation of the contributions from different extreme cross - sections of fermi surface @xcite . in case of beryllium the standard procedure",
    "requires considerable modification due to vanishing low curvature of extreme cross - sections of cigar , when the higher order terms in expansion need to be considered .",
    "the additional disadvantage of standard expansion of @xmath28 about the extreme points arises from the fact that neither curvature factor nor its derivatives are available from the experiment .",
    "the last circumstance implies the necessity of development of model representations of the fermi surface of beryllium .",
    "our consideration is based on the following model representation of electron orbit area for the cigar like sheet of fermi surface of beryllium relevant for observed dhva oscillations :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is reduced wave vector , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite is the distance in reciprocal space between two extreme cross sections of cigar. the quantity @xmath34 characterizes the discrepancy between maximal ( @xmath35 ) and minimal ( @xmath36 ) cross sections of fermi surface , and @xmath37 is average cross section area . according to eq .",

    "although , the fermi surface of beryllium was investigated very carefully in the past @xcite-@xcite , still there is lack of data concerning the transition between extreme cross sections . we show that with suitable choice of this parameter the satisfactory agreement between calculated phase diagrams and experimental data can be achieved . before calculation of the phase diagrams we emphasize that our choice of the representation of the fermi surface sheet of beryllium in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) is governed by the experimental facts @xcite-@xcite which indicate on the negligible and equal ( or almost equal in the accuracy of experiments ) curvatures of extreme cross sections .",
    "the last circumstance , e.g. negligibility and equality of the waist and hips curvatures , simplifies our task and allows us to neglect the curvatures in the vicinity @xmath39 of the extreme cross sections with proper choice of the functions describing the transition between two extreme cross sections .",
    "the oscillating part of the diamagnetic susceptibility @xmath40 is obtained by differentiating eq .",
    "( [ eq : free energy density ] ) twice with respect to the magnetic induction @xmath41 . calculating the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : free energy density ] ) with taking into account the representation ( [ eq : model ] ) and keeping the leading terms only ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , one can arrive to the following expression for the susceptibility @xmath42 where @xmath43 is reduced amplitude of dhva oscillations , e.g. the ratio between the amplitude of dhva oscillations and their period .",
    "the complex function @xmath44 where @xmath45 , depends on applied magnetic field through parameter @xmath46 . here",

    "the dingle temperature @xmath12 characterizing the quality of the material can play a crucial role in observation of electron instability .",
