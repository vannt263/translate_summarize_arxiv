    "numerical simulations and large galaxy redshift surveys have revealed a striking cosmic web , composed of clusters , filaments , sheets and voids as the primary building blocks of the large scale structure ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . according to the standard paradigm for galaxy formation ,",
    "these structure arise from gravitational instability amplifying primordial , gaussian density fluctuations in a nearly homogeneous and isotropic early universe .",
    "galaxies are the visible component of gravitationally bound systems dominated by dark matter halos , which form via gravitional collapse of density perturbations that become non - linear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since dark matter halos grow in mass by accretion , and are subjected to the tidal forces from their surroundings , the structure and formation of both dark matter halos and galaxies is affected by their large - scale environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from a dynamical point of view , matter tends to flow out of the voids , then accretes onto the sheets , collapses to the filaments , and finally accumulates onto large clusters at the intersection of multiple filaments .",
    "this accretion history is expected to impact the properties of halos and galaxies formed in them ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as their clustering strength @xcite .",
    "indeed , numerous studies have found , using numerical simulations , that the spins and/or shapes of dark matter halos are aligned with their large - scale structure @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the major axes of halos are found to lie preferentially on the shells of voids @xcite , in the plane of sheets @xcite , and along the direction of filaments @xcite . since galaxy properties , such as spin and shape ,",
    "are expected to be affected by their host halos @xcite , alignments between galaxies and large - scale environment are also expected in the current paradigm of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "observationally , numerous studies have characterized various forms of alignment between the orientation of galaxies and their large scale environment .",
    "these include the alignment between the orientation of central galaxies and the spatial distribution of their satellite galaxies , or the major axis of its host group @xcite , the alignment between the orientation of satellite galaxies and central - satellite position vector @xcite , and the alignment between galaxy group shape and the large scale structure @xcite .",
    "all these observational studies reveal a strong alignment between galaxies and their surrounding large - scale structure .",
    "moreover , the strength of the alignment is found to depend on a variety of galaxy properties .",
    "typically , the alignment effects are found to be much stronger for red galaxies than for blue galaxies , and to increase with the mass of the galaxy or its host halo .",
    "for example , using a large galaxy redshift catalog from sdss dr6 , @xcite revealed an overabundance of reference galaxies along the major axes of red galaxies out to projected distances of @xmath0 , but no alignment signal was detected for blue galaxies . using the cmass galaxy sample at @xmath1 , @xcite found that more massive galaxies are more strongly aligned with the large - scale structure up to scales of @xmath2 . using galaxies in the sdss , @xcite and",
    "@xcite found that the spin axis of bright spiral galaxies aligns with the host filament but with significant correlation with the sheet normal .",
    "theoretically , alignment studies with @xmath3-body simulations have so far focused on statistics on the orientations of halos with respect to directions defined by cosmic web , such as filaments , sheets or voids @xcite .",
    "the alignment signals found here are in general much stronger than those obtained in observations for galaxies .",
    "such kind of difference indicates that , due to complex accretion and merger histories , there is a misalignment between galaxies and their host halos .",
    "indeed , @xcite found a mean projected misalignment between a halo and its central region of @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite suggested the misalignment followed a gaussian distribution with a mean of @xmath5 and a dispersion of @xmath6 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using hydrodynamical simulations , @xcite found that galaxy spin is strongly aligned with the inner dark matter halo regions where the discs reside , but the alignment of galaxy spin with the spin of the entire host halo is much weaker .",
    "nevertheless , massive galaxy discs do have spins preferentially aligned with their host filaments , while the spin of discs in lower mass halos shows alignment with the intermediate principal axis of the large - scale tidal field @xcite .    in this paper , we study the alignments between galaxy shapes and the surrounding large - scale environments , such as filaments and sheets .",
    "different from earlier investigations , here we use a large galaxy group catalog constructed from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss dr7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so that we can distinguish between central and satellite galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we use the cosmic tidal field in the sdss dr7 survey volume directly reconstructed from the group catalog , using the method of @xcite that has been shown to be reliable . based on the signs of the eigenvalues of this tidal field we classify the cosmic web into four categories : clusters , filaments , sheets , and voids .",
    "we then measure the angles between the projected orientations of the major axes of galaxies and the eigenvectors of the local tidal tensor , and study how these alignments depend on galaxy properties . in order to interpret our results ,",
    "we compare our findings with the ( projected ) alignments of dark matter halos and their cosmic web environment obtained from a large @xmath3-body simulation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_data ]",
    ", we present the data and the methodology used to measure the various alignment signals , both for galaxies in the sdss dr7 and for dark matter halos in our @xmath3-body simulation .",
    "the alignments of galaxies and dark matter halos with respect to the cosmic web are presented in section [ sec_result ] , and we summarize and discuss our results in section [ sec_summary ] .",
    "in this section we outline how we characterize the cosmic web using galaxy groups identified in the sdss dr7 galaxy catalog , and we describe the method used to measure the alignment between galaxies and structures , such as filaments and sheets , identified in this cosmic web . we also describe a similar methodology applied to numerical @xmath3-body simulations , which we use to interpret our findings .          the sdss @xcite , one of the most influential galaxy redshift surveys , is a multi - band imaging and spectroscopic survey to explore the large - scale distribution of galaxies and quasars .",
    "the galaxy sample used here is constructed from the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is based on the sdss data release 7 @xcite , but with an independent set of significantly improved reductions over the original pipeline .",
    "marking the completion of the survey phase known as sdss - ii , dr7 features spectroscopy that is now complete over a large contiguous area of the northern galactic cap , closing the gap which was present in previous data releases .",
    "the continuity over this large area is a great advancement and critical to the statistics of large - scale structure . from the nyu - vagc",
    ", we select all galaxies in the main galaxy sample with an extinction - corrected apparent magnitude brighter than @xmath7 , with redshifts in the range @xmath8 and with redshift completeness @xmath9 .",
    "the extracted sdss galaxy catalog contains a total number of @xmath10 galaxies with a sky coverage of @xmath11 square degrees .",
    "we have complemented this sample with a small subset of galaxies that do not have sdss spectra , but for which we have used the redshifts kindly made available to us from the korea institute from advanced study ( kias ) value - added galaxy catalog @xcite .",
    "galaxy groups are selected using the adaptive halo - based group finder developed by @xcite .",
    "first potential group centers are identified using the standard fof algorithm or an isolation criterion .",
    "next , the total group luminosity , defined as the summed luminosity of all group members , is converted into an estimate for the group mass using an assumed mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this mass estimate is used to compute the expected velocity dispersion and angular size of the corresponding dark matter halo , which in turn are used to select group members in redshift space .",
    "this method is iterated until group memberships converge ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "applying our group finder to the sample of @xmath10 galaxies described above yields a catalog of @xmath12 galaxy groups ( including systems with single galaxies ) .",
    "since the group luminosities are strongly correlated with halo masses , we assign halo masses to our groups based on the ranking of the total , characteristic group luminosity , defined as the summed luminosity of all group members with @xmath13-band absolute magnitude @xmath14 . here the absolute magnitudes of galaxies are all @xmath15-corrected and evolution corrected to @xmath16 , using the method described in blanton et al .",
    "the resulting mass assignment is complete to @xmath17 for groups with mass @xmath18 .",
    "hence , in what follows we restrict our analysis to the nearby volume covering the redshift range @xmath19 , and within the large continuous region covering the north galactic cap . using all galaxy groups with an assigned mass @xmath20",
    ", @xcite constructed the mass , tidal and velocity ( sdss - mtv ) fields for this volume . in",
    "what follows , we will use these fields to quantify the cosmic web . in order to account for boundary effect that might impact the sdss - mtv field construction",
    ", @xcite introduced the ` filling factor ' parameter , @xmath21 , which characterizes the distance of a galaxy group to the survey boundary . for each group inside the volume covering the redshift range @xmath22 , the filling factor @xmath21 is defined as the fraction of the survey volume in a sphere of radius @xmath23 centered on this group .",
    "generally , large @xmath21 means that the group is located in the inner region of the survey volume , while small @xmath21 means the group is near the boundary . throughout",
    "we adopt @xmath24 , and we have tested that our results are insensitive to changes in @xmath23 of a factor of two .",
    "we also emphasize that we have found the alignment signals to be insensitive to how we cull our sample based on @xmath21 ; using only groups with @xmath25 or all groups with @xmath26 results in differences in the average misalignment angles ( see below for definition ) of @xmath27 .",
    "hence , in what follow we use all groups with @xmath28 .      in specifying the sdss - mtv fields , @xcite use the tidal tensor field @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are indices with values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , or @xmath34 , and @xmath35",

    "thus , at the location of each group we can derive @xmath35 and @xmath44 using the distribution of groups with @xmath42 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "next , the halo overdensity field , @xmath50 , is computed on a rectangular @xmath51 grid .",
    "this field is then corrected for redshift space distortions using the method of @xcite , which is based on linear theory .",
    "subsequently , fast fourier transform is used to obtain the potential field , @xmath35 , by solving the poisson equation ( [ poissoneqn ] ) , after which derivative operators are applied ( in fourier space ) to derive the tidal tensor .",
    "this tidal tensor is subsequently diagonalized to obtain the eigenvalues @xmath52 of the tidal tensor at the position of the group , which , in analogy with zeldovich theory @xcite , can be used to classify the group s environment in one of four classes :    * : a point where all three eigenvalues are positive * : a point where @xmath44 has one negative and two positive eigenvalues * : a point where @xmath44 has two negative and one positive eigenvalues * : a point where all three eigenvalues are negative    ( see hahn et al . 2007a , b ) .",

    "the main goal of this study is to characterize to what extent the orientation of galaxies is aligned with the structure of its surrounding cosmic web ( i.e. , the orientation of filaments and sheets ) .",
    "to that extent we consider two alignment angles : for galaxies whose group is located in a environment , we compute the angle @xmath65 , defined as the angle between the orientation of the galaxy , @xmath66 , and the direction of the filament , @xmath67 . for galaxies whose group is located in a environment , we instead compute the angle @xmath68 , defined as the angle between @xmath66 and the normal direction of the sheet @xmath69 .",

    ", though , we include all galaxies , independent of their environment , and we show the alignment angles with all three eigenvectors of the tidal tensor .",
    "there is a very significant alignment ( @xmath161 ) with the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue , @xmath158 , which is expected from the fact that we had already seen (  [ sec_gs ] ) that galaxies are preferentially oriented perpendicular to the normal vector of the sheet .",
    "there is no indication of any alignment between galaxies and the intermediate eigenvector , @xmath159 , but again a very significant alignment ( @xmath162 ) with the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue , @xmath160 .",
    "the latter is again expected from the fact that galaxies ( which make up 53.6% of the _ entire _ galaxy population ) are aligned with the direction of their filaments .",
    "the second row in fig  [ fig : tf ] shows the alignments between the projected orientations of dark matter halos and the eigenvectors of the tidal tensor ( also in projection ) , obtained from the @xmath3-body simulation .",
    "halos are anti - aligned with @xmath158 , positively aligned with @xmath160 , and not aligned with @xmath159 , in excellent agreement with previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results are also in good , qualitative agreement with the alignments seen for the sdss galaxies , although the alignment for halos is found to be significantly stronger than that for the entire galaxy population .",
    "as shown above , red central galaxies seem to be far more strongly aligned with their sheets or filaments than blue centrals or satellites .",
    "the third row of fig  [ fig : tf ] therefore shows the alignments of red centrals with the eigenvectors of the tidal tensor .",
    "these are found to be amazingly similar to those of the dark matter halos , supporting the notion that red centrals may be strongly aligned with their host halos .",
    "in contrast , blue centrals do not show any significant alignments with the eigenvectors of the tidal tensor ( the fourth row of the figure ) .",
    "using galaxy groups selected from the sdss dr7 , we have examined the alignment between the major axes of galaxies and their surrounding large - scale structure , especially the filaments and sheets .",
    "we characterized the large scale structure using the tidal tensor , which we reconstructed using galaxy groups with an assigned halo mass @xmath18 .",
    "based on the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor at the location of each galaxy group , we have split the galaxy population into four environments : , , and .",
    "we have shown that the major axes of galaxies in a environment are preferentially aligned along the direction of the filament ( defined as the direction of the eigenvector of the tidal tensor associated with the single negative eigenvalue ) , while galaxies in a environment are preferentially aligned perpendicular to the normal vector of the sheet ( defined as the direction of the eigenvector of the tidal tensor associated with the single positive eigenvalue ) . in both cases ,",
    "the alignment is strongest for red central galaxies , is weak for blue centrals , and is virtually absent for satellite galaxies significant alignment for red satellites with the direction of their filament . ] .",
    "in addition , the alignment strength is found to increase with galaxy luminosity and/or stellar mass .",
    "we also computed the alignments between the orientations of _ all _ galaxies ( independent of their environment ) and the three eigenvectors of the tidal tensor at the location of the galaxy group in which they reside .",
    "consistent with the above results , we find a strong anti - alignment ( at @xmath161 significance ) with the eigenvector @xmath158 associated with the largest eigenvalue , no alignment at all with the eigenvector @xmath159 associated with the intermediate eigenvalue , and strong , positive alignment ( at @xmath162 significance ) with the eigenvector @xmath160 assocated with the smallest eigenvalue . in the case of red , central galaxies , the significance of these alignments becomes even stronger : @xmath163 and @xmath164 in the cases of the alignments with @xmath158 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , for blue galaxies the alignments are always quite weak .    using a large , @xmath3-body simulation , we also calculated how the shapes of dark matter halos are aligned with their filaments and sheets ( in projection ) .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , we find alignment strengths for the dark matter halos that are indistinguishable from those of red centrals , strongly suggesting that red central galaxies are strongly aligned with their dark matter host halos .",
    "this is consistent with the results obtained in @xcite , all of which show that red centrals and their host halos are more strongly aligned than the halo - filament and halo - sheet alignments found here .",
    "these measured alignments between galaxy shape and the surrounding large - scale structure from observation may indicate that galaxy formation is affected by large - scale environments .",
    "the alignment signals may be a natural result of how galaxies accrete material via streams along the direction of the filaments , and the thin plane of the sheets .",
    "they also suggest that the shapes and orientations of red central galaxies are significantly affected by such accretion .",
    "the fact that blue centrals show an alignment signal that is much weaker than that of dark matter halos implies that blue central galaxies are only poorly aligned with the shape of their host halos .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of which focussed on the alignment of central galaxies with the spatial ( angular ) distribution of satellite galaxies .",
    "the fact that the projected orientation of blue centrals is positively aligned with that of the filaments ( albeit at a marginaly level ) , is also interesting in light of some recent results by @xcite and @xcite , who found evidence that the rotation axes of disk galaxies are ( weakly ) aligned with the directions of their filaments .",
    "a similar result was obtained by @xcite , albeit for _ massive _ disk galaxies in hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "using @xmath3-body simulations , @xcite found that the spin axis of a dark matter halo is correlated with the directions of the tidal directions , but the correlation is significantly halo mass dependent . for halos with masses as low as @xmath165 ,",
    "the correlation becomes rather weak but is still significant . in",
    "as far as ` blue ' galaxies are ` disk ' galaxies with spin axis similar to their host halos , our results are not consistent with these results .",
    "we caution , though , that all three studies performed their analysis in 3d , while our analysis is done in projection in 2d .",
    "in addition , all studies only found a positive alignment between spin vector and filament direction for _ massive _ disk galaxies and halos .",
    "it might well be that projection effects , and the inclusion of large numbers of less massive galaxies , largely erase the signatures of the mild alignment effects seen in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "if galaxies are strongly aligned with sheets and filaments , as we find here at least for red central galaxies , then galaxies should also be mutually aligned over scales of those sheets and filaments .",
    "such alignments have important ramifications for cosmic shear measurements based on the orientation correlation of source galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results can help in modeling such contaminations .",
    "in particular , our finding that the alignments are strong only for red bright galaxies suggests that the contaminations can be reduced by using only blue and relatively faint sources .",
