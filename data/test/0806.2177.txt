    "the standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model is a popular phenomenological description of the rather idealized isotropic and homogeneous universe filled with perfect fluid .",
    "however this model is too ideal to be used to describe the universe with global rotation .",
    "considering that all compact objects in the universe are rotating , it would be nature to think that the rotation is a universal phenomenon which may also apply to the global universe .",
    "an exact solution for the rotating universe was found by gdel @xcite , which satisfies einstein s field equations containing a cosmological constant and homogeneous pressureless matter .",
    "gdel universe possesses several special features including , in particular , the presence of closed timelike curve ( i.e. the time machine ) @xcite through every point .    a great deal of effort",
    "@xcite has been spent in recent years in studying gdel - type solutions in the context of five - dimensional minimal supergravity .",
    "these solutions are related by t duality to pp - waves @xcite , which make the gdel - type universes important since they might provide the possibility of quantizing strings in these backgrounds and building relations to the corresponding limits of super - yang mills theories .",
    "the black hole solution must embed in the gdel universe .",
    "the solutions of the neutral non - rotating and rotating black holes immersed in the rotating gdel universe were found in the five - dimensional minimal supergravity @xcite , which are called schwarzschild and kerr gdel black holes .",
    "these black hole solutions also satisfy the usual black hole thermodynamics @xcite . in the study of the wave dynamical properties of schwarzschild gdel black hole@xcite , it was found that the schwarzschild gdel black hole is stable at least for the small gdel parameter regime .",
    "recently , there have been more solutions of black holes found in gdel universe and various properties have been investigated accordingly @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are going to study the hawking radiation in the rotating black hole embedded in the gdel universe .",
    "we will calculate the greybody factor of scalar particles propagating in this kerr gdel black hole and show rich physics brought by the rotation parameter @xmath1 of the black hole and the gdel parameter @xmath0 by using the matching technique , which has been extensively used in evaluating the absorption probabilities and hawking radiations of various black holes @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the following section we will introduce the kerr gdel metric and derive the master equation of scalar field in the limit of small gdel parameter @xmath0 . in sec.iii , we will obtain the approximate solution in the low energy and low angular momentum limit . in section iv",
    ", we will calculate the absorption probability and the luminosity of hawking radiation for the scalar field .",
    "finally in the last section we will include our conclusions .",
    "the equations of the bosonic field in the minimal supergravity theory in five dimensions are written in the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the solutions of equations ( [ go1 ] ) consist of the metric and a @xmath5 gauge field which has an additional chern - simons interaction .",
    "the gdel universe is a solution of the equation ( [ go1 ] ) , whose metric and @xmath5 gauge field are given by @xcite @xmath6 with @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are euler angles .",
    "@xmath0 is the gdel parameter and is responsible for the rotation of the gdel universe .",
    "the angular velocity of the universe is @xmath11 . when @xmath12 , the closed timelike curves appear .",
    "the matter content of gdel universe ( [ m1 ] ) consists of pressureless dust and the energy - momentum tensor for the field @xmath13 has vanishing pressure and constant energy density proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , just like the original four dimensional gdel universe @xcite , the solution ( [ m1 ] ) is homogeneous .",
    "when @xmath15 , the metric ( [ m1 ] ) reduces to the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the solution of the equation ( [ go1 ] ) which describes a five dimensional rotating black hole ( with the two equal rotation parameters ) embedded in the gdel universe can be written as @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath1 are related to the mass and angular momentum of the black hole , respectively .",
    "when @xmath19 , the metric reduces to that of the five - dimensional gdel universe ( [ m1 ] ) . when @xmath15 it reduces to the five - dimensional kerr black hole with two equal rotation parameters . when @xmath20 the solution becomes the schwarzschild - gdel black hole .",
    "the kerr gdel black hole ( [ metric0 ] ) has an outer horizon at @xmath21 and an inner horizon at @xmath22 , @xmath23 which are determined by @xmath24 .",
    "the metric is well behaved at the horizon but the gauge field becomes singular there .",
    "the function @xmath25 is equal to zero when @xmath26 , corresponding to an ergosphere @xcite .",
    "the hawking temperature @xmath27 of the black hole and the angular velocity @xmath28 at horizon are described as @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .    in the following",
    "we will investigate hawking radiation of a scalar field in the small @xmath0 case since the small rotation of the gdel cosmological background seems the most reasonable in phenomenology @xcite . in the limit of small @xmath0 ,",
    "the metric coefficients ( [ metric0 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath31 the non - zero components of the inverse metric @xmath32 and the determinant @xmath33 can be expressed as @xmath34 with @xmath35    the wave equation for the massless scalar field @xmath36 in the kerr gdel black hole spacetime obeys @xmath37 taking the ansatz @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the so - called spheroidal harmonics , we can obtain the equation @xmath40 -\\bigg[\\frac{(m-\\lambda\\cos{\\theta})^2}{\\sin^2{\\theta}}-e_{lm\\lambda}\\bigg]s(\\theta)=0,\\label{angd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the angular part .",
    "obviously , this angular equation is independent of the rotating parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and is exactly identical to that in the static five - dimensional black hole spacetime .",
    "this is not surprising and in @xcite the same angular equation as that in the schwarzschild spacetime was also obtained in the five - dimensional kerr black hole with two equal rotational parameters .",
    "the eigenvalue of the angular equation ( [ angd ] ) is @xmath41 .",

    "in order to construct a full analytic solution valid for the whole radial regime , we need to smoothly match the near horizon and far field solutions in the intermediate zone . for the benefit of the following discussion",
