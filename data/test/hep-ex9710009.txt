    "the standard model ( sm ) predicts the production of events at lep2 with one or more photons and missing energy through two processes : radiative returns to the z resonance ( @xmath8 ) with z@xmath9 , and @xmath10-channel w exchange with photon(s ) radiated from the beam electrons or the w.   such events have been studied in e@xmath11e@xmath12 annihilations at centre - of - mass energies of 130 and 136 gev  @xcite and 161 gev  @xcite as well as at previous collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "the process  is well understood theoretically , so any significant deviation from the predictions of the standard model could signal new physics .    events with one or more photons and missing energy could arise in supersymmetry where the missing energy is caused by weakly interacting supersymmetric particles .",
    "for example , in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , the second lightest neutralino can decay radiatively to the lightest neutralino  @xcite .",
    "a large branching ratio for this decay is expected only in a small region of parameter space .",
    "this region can however be enlarged by breaking the condition on the unification of gaugino masses at the gut scale .",
    "alternatively there are susy models which postulate that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is the gravitino . in these models",
    "the lightest neutralino decays to an essentially massless gravitino ( m@xmath13 ) and a photon with a 100% branching ratio .",
    "examples include the so - called `` no - scale supergravity '' ( lnz model )  @xcite and models with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb )  @xcite . in both classes of models",
    ", one might expect the process  at lep2 , seen in the detector as two photons and missing energy .",
    "the one - photon process  is expected to be produced at lep2 for only very light gravitino masses as the cross section scales as the inverse of the gravitino mass squared  @xcite . for a gravitino mass of @xmath14 the cross section",
    "is predicted to be around 1 pb . in the lnz model the gravitino mass is allowed to be this light  @xcite , but in gmsb the gravitino is predicted to have a mass five orders of magnitude bigger .",
    "thus , this process is not expected in gmsb .",
    "the data collected by aleph at energies of 161 , 170 and 172 gev ( 11.1 , 1.1  and 9.5  , respectively ) have been analysed for anomalous single - photon and two - photon production using criteria optimized for a range of susy particle masses .",
    "no evidence for anomalous photon(s ) and missing energy events is found , and limits are placed on the production of supersymmetric particles in the context of the models introduced above . for gmsb , the neutralino composition is assumed to be pure bino throughout this letter .",
    "the cdf collaboration has observed an unusual event with two high energy electrons , two high energy photons , and a large amount of missing transverse energy  @xcite .",
    "the sm explanation for this event has a low probability , but it can be accommodated by the susy models mentioned above . in the neutralino lsp scenario",
    "the cdf event could be explained by the drell - yan process where the two s escape detection resulting in missing transverse energy .",
    "if this is the explanation for the cdf event , the best possibility for discovery at lep2 is . in principle  could be considered , however the predicted cross section is uninterestingly small . in gravitino lsp models ,",
    "the cdf event could be explained by . in this scenario",
    "the best channel for discovery at lep2 is .",
    "the limits derived from the aleph data are compared to the regions favored by the cdf event within these models .",
    "the outline of this letter is as follows : after a brief description of the detector in section 2 , the monte carlo samples are presented in section 3 , the one photon and two photon plus missing energy searches are detailed in sections 4 and 5 and conclusions are stated in section 6 .",
    "the aleph detector and its performance are described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here depends largely on the performance of the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "the luminosity calorimeters ( lcal and sical ) , together with the hadron calorimeter ( hcal ) , are used mainly to veto events in which photons are accompanied by other energetic particles .",
    "the hcal is instrumented with streamer tubes , which are useful in identifying muons .",
    "the sical provides coverage between 34 and 63 mrad from the beam axis while the lcal provides coverage between 45 and 160 mrad .",
    "the lcal consists of two halves which fit together around the beam axis ; the area where the two halves join is a region of reduced sensitivity ( the lcal crack ) .",
    "this vertical crack accounts for only 0.05% of the total solid angle coverage of the aleph detector . the tracking system , composed of a silicon vertex detector , wire drift chamber ( itc ) , and time projection chamber ( tpc ) , is used to provide efficient ( @xmath15 ) tracking of isolated charged particles in the angular range @xmath16 .    the ecal is a lead / wire - plane sampling calorimeter consisting of 36 modules , twelve in the barrel and twelve in each endcap , which provide coverage in the angular range @xmath17 .",
    "inter - module cracks reduce this solid angle coverage by 2% in the barrel and 6% in the endcaps .",
    "however , the ecal and hcal cracks are not aligned so there is complete coverage in aleph at large polar angles . at normal incidence",
    "the ecal is situated at 185 cm from the interaction point .",
    "the total thickness of the ecal is 22 radiation lengths at normal incidence .",
    "anode wire signals , sampled every @xmath18 during their rise time , provide a measurement by the ecal of the interaction time @xmath19 of the particles relative to the beam crossing with a resolution better than @xmath20 ( for showers with energy greater than 1 ) .",
    "cathode pads associated with each layer of the wire chambers are connected to form projective ` towers ' , each subtending approximately @xmath21 , which are oriented towards the interaction point .",
    "each tower is read out in three segments in depth of four , nine and nine radiation lengths .",
    "the high granularity of the calorimeter provides excellent identification of photons and electrons .",
    "the energy calibration of the ecal is obtained from bhabha and gamma - gamma events .",
    "the energy resolution is measured to be @xmath22 ( @xmath23 in gev ) @xcite .",
    "photon candidates are identified using an algorithm @xcite which performs a topological search for localised energy depositions within groups of neighboring ecal towers .",
    "these energy depositions are required to have transverse and longitudinal profiles consistent with that of an electromagnetic shower .",
    "photons far from ecal cracks have their energy measured solely from the localised energy deposition . in order to optimise the energy reconstruction , photons that are not well - contained in the ecal ( near or in a crack )",
    "have their energy measured from the sum of the localised energy depositions and all energy deposits in the hcal within a cone of .",
    "photon candidates may also be identified in the tracking system if they convert producing an electron - positron pair  @xcite .",
    "the trigger most relevant for photonic events is the neutral energy trigger . for the 1996 run ,",
    "the total wire energy measured in an ecal module must be greater than 1  in the barrel and 2.3   in the endcaps in order for this trigger to fire .",
    "the neutral energy trigger is fully efficient for the analyses to be described .",
    "the efficiency for the  cross section measurement and the background for the anomalous photon plus missing energy searches are estimated using the koralz monte carlo program  @xcite .",
    "this monte carlo is checked by comparing to nunugg  @xcite at  below the w threshold and to comphep  @xcite at higher energies .",
    "the monte carlos agree within errors to 1% for the emission of one photon .",
    "the two photon plus missing energy signature is checked for loose acceptance cuts ( e@xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and in a more restrictive region ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between koralz and comphep is at most 10%  @xcite .",
    "background to the photon(s ) plus missing energy signature can come from  and where initial or final state particles radiate a photon and the final state particles escape along the beam direction undetected .",
    "this background is studied using the gggb03  @xcite and bhwide  @xcite monte carlo programs , respectively .",
    "the signal generator susygen  @xcite is used to design the selection criteria and evaluate the efficiency for the searches for new physics .",
    "the standard model predicts a large cross section for the process , which constitutes an irreducible background to searches for new physics .",
    "one can , however , still search for new physics by observing an excess of events over the standard model prediction .",
    "this requires a precise understanding of the background level from  and a reduction of cosmic ray and detector noise events ( non - subtractable backgrounds ) to a negligible level .",
    "initially , events are selected with no charged tracks ( not coming from a conversion ) and exactly one photon inside the acceptance cuts of @xmath27 and @xmath28  ( where @xmath29 is defined as the measured transverse momentum relative to the beam axis ) .",
    "the remaining selection criteria are tailored to eliminate as much as possible the non - subtractable backgrounds .",
    "cosmic ray events that traverse the detector are eliminated by the charged track requirement or if there are hits in the outer part of the hcal .",
    "a small fraction of cosmic ray events and detector noise events in the ecal remain after these cuts .",
    "the ecal information can be exploited to remove these types of events .",
    "the barycentre of the photon shower is found in each of the three ecal stacks .",
    "taking two points at a time , three possible photon trajectories are calculated and used to estimate the distance of closest approach of the photon to the interaction point .",
    "the smallest of the three distances ( ` impact parameter of the photon ' ) is required to be less than 25 cm .",
    "the compactness of the shower in the ecal is calculated by taking an energy - weighted average of the angle subtended at the interaction point between the cluster barycentre and the barycentre of each of the ecal storeys contributing to the cluster .",
    "the compactness is required to be less than 0.85@xmath30 .",
    "both the impact parameter and compactness distributions are peaked at low values for photons coming from the interaction point and at high values for the remaining background .",
    "the cuts are chosen so that there is negligible efficiency loss for real photons .",
    "finally , the interaction time is required to be within 40 ns of the beam crossing .    a single photon and missing energy might also be caused by initial or final state radiation when the final state particles escape along the beam direction .",
    "most of the events that satisfy the requirement that the @xmath29 of the photon must be greater than will have a particle within the angular acceptance of the detector .",
    "these events are eliminated by the no charged track requirement and the following cut .",
    "the event is rejected if the total energy in the detector excluding the photon is more than 1   or if there is any energy reconstructed within 14@xmath30 of the beam axis .",
    "this requirement reduces the efficiency for by 11% due to additional brehmsstrahlung photons at low angles ( 7% loss ) and uncorrelated noise in the detector ( 4% loss ) . to compensate for vertical cracks in the lcal , the @xmath29 requirement",
    "is tightened to 0.145@xmath6 if the missing momentum vector points to within 17@xmath30 of 90@xmath30 or 270@xmath30 in azimuthal angle ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "residual cosmic ray and detector noise backgrounds are measured by selecting events slightly out of time with respect to the beam crossing but which pass all other cuts .",
    "no such events are found in a displaced time window of 740 ns width .",
    "events with a radiated photon in the acceptance and the final state particles escaping undetected along the beam axis are studied using monte carlo .",
    "the equivalent of 60 data sets of these sm background processes was generated and passed through the full detector simulation .",
    "no events from these samples survive the selection .    ._the cumulative efficiency for the  process inside the acceptance cuts . _ [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "one event is found in the data while 1.3 events are expected from background .",
    "the upper limit on the cross section in the ,  mass plane are shown in figure  [ x2 ] , assuming a branching ratio for  of 100% .",
    "the systematic uncertainties for this analysis are the same as for the gravitino lsp scenario and the effect on the upper limit is again less than 1% .",
    "the  lsp interpretation of the cdf event ( along with the non - observation of other susy signatures at fermilab ) suggests a high branching ratio for .",
    "a 100% branching ratio is achieved when the   is pure photino and the  is pure higgsino . assuming this scenario , the lower mass limit of  as a function of the selectron mass is calculated and compared to the region compatible with the cdf event . in figure  [ exclkane ] two scenarios",
    "m@xmath32 = m@xmath33 and m@xmath34 m@xmath33 are shown . with the assumption that the  is pure photino and",
    "the  is pure higgsino , these results exclude a significant portion of the region compatible with the kinematics of the cdf event given by the neutralino lsp interpretation .",
    "data recorded with the aleph detector at lep centre - of - mass energies of 161  and 170/172  show no signs of new physics in the photon(s ) plus missing energy channels .",
    "the cross sections and distributions for   are measured and found to be in agreement with standard model expectations . the experimental 95% c.l .",
    "upper limits on the cross sections are derived for the following supersymmetric processes ,  and .",
    "these cross section limits are actually more general and can be applied to the reactions : @xmath35 where y is massless and @xmath36 where y is massless or has mass . the 95% c.l .",
    "limit on the  mass is found to be 71  ( @xmath1 3 ns ) for gravitino lsp susy scenarios .",
    "the excluded region of the susy breaking scale as a function of neutralino mass is derived .",
    "the lower limit on the  ( ) mass as a function of selectron mass is determined and compared to the region compatible with the cdf event for the gravitino ( neutralino ) lsp scenario .",
