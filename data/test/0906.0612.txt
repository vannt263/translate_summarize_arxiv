    "a lot has been learned about graphs and their mathematical properties  @xcite . in the 20th century",
    "they have also become extremely useful as representation of a wide variety of systems in different areas .",
    "biological , social , technological , and information networks can be studied as graphs , and graph analysis has become crucial to understand the features of these systems .",
    "for instance , social network analysis started in the 1930 s and has become one of the most important topics in sociology  @xcite . in recent times , the computer revolution has provided scholars with a huge amount of data and computational resources to process and analyze these data .",
    "the size of real networks one can potentially handle has also grown considerably , reaching millions or even billions of vertices .",
    "the need to deal with such a large number of units has produced a deep change in the way graphs are approached  @xcite .",
    "graphs representing real systems are not regular like , e. g. , lattices .",
    "they are objects where order coexists with disorder .",
    "the paradigm of disordered graph is the random graph , introduced by p. erds and a. rnyi  @xcite . in it ,",
    "the probability of having an edge between a pair of vertices is equal for all possible pairs ( see appendix ) . in a random graph ,",
    "the distribution of edges among the vertices is highly homogeneous .",
    "for instance , the distribution of the number of neighbours of a vertex , or _ degree _",
    ", is binomial , so most vertices have equal or similar degree .",
    "real networks are not random graphs , as they display big inhomogeneities , revealing a high level of order and organization .",
    "the degree distribution is broad , with a tail that often follows a power law : therefore , many vertices with low degree coexist with some vertices with large degree .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of edges is not only globally , but also locally inhomogeneous , with high concentrations of edges within special groups of vertices , and low concentrations between these groups .",
    "this feature of real networks is called _ community structure _  @xcite , or _ clustering _ , and is the topic of this review ( for earlier reviews see refs .",
    "communities , also called _ clusters _ or _ modules _ , are groups of vertices which probably share common properties and/or play similar roles within the graph . in fig .",

    "society offers a wide variety of possible group organizations : families , working and friendship circles , villages , towns , nations .",
    "the diffusion of internet has also led to the creation of virtual groups , that live on the web , like online communities .",
    "indeed , social communities have been studied for a long time  @xcite .",
    "communities also occur in many networked systems from biology , computer science , engineering , economics , politics , etc . in protein - protein interaction networks ,",
    "communities are likely to group proteins having the same specific function within the cell  @xcite , in the graph of the world wide web they may correspond to groups of pages dealing with the same or related topics  @xcite , in metabolic networks they may be related to functional modules such as cycles and pathways  @xcite , in food webs they may identify compartments  @xcite , and so on .",
    "communities can have concrete applications .",
    "clustering web clients who have similar interests and are geografically near to each other may improve the performance of services provided on the world wide web , in that each cluster of clients could be served by a dedicated mirror server  @xcite .",
    "identifying clusters of customers with similar interests in the network of purchase relationships between customers and products of online retailers ( like , e. g. , www.amazon.com ) enables to set up efficient recommendation systems  @xcite , that better guide customers through the list of items of the retailer and enhance the business opportunities .",
    "clusters of large graphs can be used to create data structures in order to efficiently store the graph data and to handle navigational queries , like path searches  @xcite .",
    "_ ad hoc networks _",
    "@xcite , i. e. self - configuring networks formed by communication nodes acting in the same region and rapidly changing ( because the devices move , for instance ) , usually have no centrally maintained routing tables that specify how nodes have to communicate to other nodes .",
    "grouping the nodes into clusters enables one to generate compact routing tables while the choice of the communication paths is still efficient  @xcite .",
    "community detection is important for other reasons , too .",
    "identifying modules and their boundaries allows for a classification of vertices , according to their structural position in the modules .",
    "so , vertices with a central position in their clusters , i.  e. sharing a large number of edges with the other group partners , may have an important function of control and stability within the group ; vertices lying at the boundaries between modules play an important role of mediation and lead the relationships and exchanges between different communities ( alike to csermely s `` creative elements ''  @xcite ) .",
    "such classification seems to be meaningful in social  @xcite and metabolic networks  @xcite .",
    "finally , one can study the graph where vertices are the communities and edges are set between clusters if there are connections between some of their vertices in the original graph and/or if the modules overlap . in this way",
    "one attains a coarse - grained description of the original graph , which unveils the relationships between modules  .",
    "recent studies indicate that networks of communities have a different degree distribution with respect to the full graphs  @xcite ; however , the origin of their structures can be explained by the same mechanism  @xcite .",
    "another important aspect related to community structure is the hierarchical organization displayed by most networked systems in the real world .",
    "real networks are usually composed by communities including smaller communities , which in turn include smaller communities , etc .",
    "the human body offers a paradigmatic example of hierarchical organization : it is composed by organs , organs are composed by tissues , tissues by cells , etc .",
    "another example is represented by business firms , who are characterized by a pyramidal organization , going from the workers to the president , with intermediate levels corresponding to work groups , departments and management .",
    "herbert a. simon has emphasized the crucial role played by hierarchy in the structure and evolution of complex systems  @xcite .",
    "the generation and evolution of a system organized in interrelated stable subsystems are much quicker than if the system were unstructured , because it is much easier to assemble the smallest subparts first and use them as building blocks to get larger structures , until the whole system is assembled . in this way it is also far more difficult that errors ( mutations ) occur along the process .",
    "the aim of community detection in graphs is to identify the modules and , possibly , their hierarchical organization , by only using the information encoded in the graph topology .",
    "the problem has a long tradition and it has appeared in various forms in several disciplines .",
    "the first analysis of community structure was carried out by weiss and jacobson  @xcite , who searched for work groups within a government agency .",
    "the authors studied the matrix of working relationships between members of the agency , which were identified by means of private interviews .",
    "work groups were separated by removing the members working with people of different groups , which act as connectors between them .",
    "this idea of cutting the bridges between groups is at the basis of several modern algorithms of community detection ( section  [ sec5 ] ) .",
    "research on communities actually started even earlier than the paper by weiss and jacobson .",
    "already in 1927 , stuart rice looked for clusters of people in small political bodies , based on the similarity of their voting patterns  @xcite .",
    "two decades later , george homans showed that social groups could be revealed by suitably rearranging the rows and the columns of matrices describing social ties , until they take an approximate block - diagonal form  @xcite .",
    "this procedure is now standard .",
    "meanwhile , traditional techniques to find communities in social networks are hierarchical clustering and partitional clustering ( sections  [ sec4_2 ] and  [ sec4_3 ] ) , where vertices are joined into groups according to their mutual similarity .    identifying graph communities",
    "is a popular topic in computer science , too . in parallel computing , for instance",
    ", it is crucial to know what is the best way to allocate tasks to processors so as to minimize the communications between them and enable a rapid performance of the calculation .",
    "this can be accomplished by splitting the computer cluster into groups with roughly the same number of processors , such that the number of physical connections between processors of different groups is minimal .",
    "the mathematical formalization of this problem is called _ graph partitioning _",
    "( section  [ sec4_1 ] ) . the first algorithms for graph partitioning were proposed in the early 1970 s .    in a seminal paper appeared in 2002 ,",
    "girvan and newman proposed a new algorithm , aiming at the identification of edges lying between communities and their successive removal , a procedure that after some iterations leads to the isolation of the communities  @xcite .",
    "the intercommunity edges are detected according to the values of a centrality measure , the edge betweenness , that expresses the importance of the role of the edges in processes where signals are transmitted across the graph following paths of minimal length .",
    "the paper triggered a big activity in the field , and many new methods have been proposed in the last years . in particular , physicists entered the game , bringing in their tools and techniques : spin models , optimization , percolation , random walks , synchronization , etc .",
    ", became ingredients of new original algorithms .",
    "the field has also taken advantage of concepts and methods from computer science , nonlinear dynamics , sociology , discrete mathematics .        in this manuscript",
    "we try to cover in some detail the work done in this area .",
    "we shall pay a special attention to the contributions made by physicists , but we shall also give proper credit to important results obtained by scholars of other disciplines . section  [ sec2 ] introduces communities in real networks , and is supposed to make the reader acquainted with the problem and its relevance . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we define the basic elements of community detection , i. e. the concepts of community and partition .",
    "traditional clustering methods in computer and social sciences , i. e. graph partitioning , hierarchical , partitional and spectral clustering are reviewed in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "modern methods , divided into categories based on the type of approach , are presented in sections  [ sec5 ] to  [ sub_sec6_2 ] .",
    "algorithms to find overlapping communities , multiresolution and hierarchical techniques , are separately described in sections  [ sec45 ] and [ sub_sec6_20 ] , respectively , whereas section  [ sec7_1_2 ] is devoted to the detection of communities evolving in time .",
    "we stress that our categorization of the algorithms is not sharp , because many algorithms may enter more categories : we tried to classify them based on what we believe is their main feature / purpose , even if other aspects may be present .",
    "sections  [ sec6_4 ] and [ sec6 ] are devoted to the issues of defining when community structure is significant , and deciding about the quality of algorithms performances . in sections",
    "[ sec7_1 ] and [ sec7_2 ] we describe general properties of clusters found in real networks , and specific applications of clustering algorithms .",
    "section  [ sec8 ] contains the summary of the review , along with a discussion about future research directions in this area .",
    "the review makes use of several concepts of graph theory , that are defined and explained in the appendix .",
    "readers not acquainted with these concepts are urged to read the appendix first .",
    "in this section we shall present some striking examples of real networks with community structure . in this way",
    "we shall see what communities look like and why they are important .",
    "social networks are paradigmatic examples of graphs with communities .",
    "the word community itself refers to a social context .",
    "people naturally tend to form groups , within their work environment , family , friends .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show some examples of social networks .",
    "the first example ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) is zachary s network of karate club members  @xcite , a well - known graph regularly used as a benchmark to test community detection algorithms ( section  [ sec6_1 ] ) .",
    "it consists of @xmath0 vertices , the members of a karate club in the united states , who were observed during a period of three years .",
    "edges connect individuals who were observed to interact outside the activities of the club . at some point ,",
    "a conflict between the club president and the instructor led to the fission of the club in two separate groups , supporting the instructor and the president , respectively ( indicated by squares and circles ) .",
    "the question is whether from the original network structure it is possible to infer the composition of the two groups . indeed , by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig3]a one can distinguish two aggregations , one around vertices @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( @xmath0 is the president ) , the other around vertex @xmath2 ( the instructor ) .",
    "one can also identify several vertices lying between the two main structures , like @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ; such vertices are often misclassified by community detection methods .",
    "[ fig3]b displays the largest connected component of a network of collaborations of scientists working at the santa fe institute ( sfi ) .",
    "there are @xmath6 vertices , representing resident scientists at sfi and their collaborators .",
    "edges are placed between scientists that have published at least one paper together .",
    "the visualization layout allows to distinguish disciplinary groups . in this network one",
    "observes many cliques , as authors of the same paper are all linked to each other .",
    "there are but a few connections between most groups .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c we show the network of bottlenose dolphins living in doubtful sound ( new zealand ) analyzed by lusseau  @xcite .",
    "there are @xmath7 dolphins and edges were set between animals that were seen together more often than expected by chance .",
    "the dolphins separated in two groups after a dolphin left the place for some time ( squares and circles in the figure ) .",
    "such groups are quite cohesive , with several internal cliques , and easily identifiable : only six edges join vertices of different groups . due to this natural classification lusseau",
    "s dolphins network , like zachary s karate club , is often used to test algorithms for community detection ( section  [ sec6_1 ] ) .",
    "protein - protein interaction ( ppi ) networks are subject of intense investigations in biology and bioinformatics , as the interactions between proteins are fundamental for each process in the cell  @xcite .",
    "[ fig4 ] illustrates a ppi network of the rat proteome  @xcite .",
    "each interaction is derived by homology from experimentally observed interactions in other organisms . in our example",
    ", the proteins interact very frequently with each other , as they belong to metastatic cells , which have a high motility and invasiveness with respect to normal cells .",
    "communities correspond to functional groups , i.  e. to proteins having the same or similar functions , which are expected to be involved in the same processes .",
    "the modules are labeled by the overall function or the dominating protein class .",
    "most communities are associated to cancer and metastasis , which indirectly shows how important detecting modules in ppi networks is .",
    "community structure in technological networks .",
    "sample of the web graph consisting of the pages of a web site and their mutual hyperlinks , which are directed .",
    "communities , indicated by the colors , were detected with the algorithm of girvan and newman ( section  [ subsec5_1 ] ) , by neglecting the directedness of the edges . reprinted figure with permission from ref .  @xcite .",
    "2004 by the american physical society .",
    "]    relationships / interactions between elements of a system need not be reciprocal . in many cases",
    "they have a precise direction , that needs to be taken into account to understand the system as a whole . as an example we can cite predator - prey relationships in food webs . in fig .  [ fig5 ]",
    "we see another example , taken from technology .",
    "the system is the world wide web , which can be seen as a graph by representing web pages as vertices and the hyperlinks that make users move from one page to another as edges  @xcite .",
    "hyperlinks are directed : if one can move from page a to page b by clicking on a hyperlink of a , one usually does not find on b a hyperlink taking back to a. in fact , very few hyperlinks ( less than @xmath8 ) are reciprocal .",
    "communities of the web graph are groups of pages having topical similarities . detecting communities in the web graph may help to identify the artificial clusters created by link farms in order to enhance the pagerank  @xcite value of web sites and grant them a higher google ranking . in this way one could discourage this unfair practice .",
    "one usually assumes that the existence of a hyperlink between two pages implies that they are content - related , and that this similarity is independent of the hyperlink direction .",
    "therefore it is customary to neglect the directedness of the hyperlinks and to consider the graph as undirected , for the purpose of community detection . on the other hand , taking properly into account the directedness of the edges can considerably improve the quality of the partition(s ) , as one can handle a lot of precious information about the system .",
    "moreover , in some instances neglecting edge directedness may lead to strange results  @xcite .",
    "developing methods of community detection for directed graphs is a hard task .",
    "for instance , a directed graph is characterized by asymmetrical matrices ( adjacency matrix , laplacian , etc . ) , so spectral analysis is much more complex .",
    "only a few techniques can be easily extended from the undirected to the directed case .",
    "otherwise , the problem must be formulated from scratch .",
    "edge directedness is not the only complication to deal with when facing the problem of graph clustering . in many real networks",
    "vertices may belong to more than one group . in this case one",
    "speaks of _ overlapping communities _ and uses the term _ cover _ , rather than partition , whose standard definition forbids multiple memberships of vertices .",
    "classical examples are social networks , where an individual usually belongs to different circles at the same time , from that of work colleagues to family , sport associations , etc .. traditional algorithms of community detection assign each vertex to a single module . in so doing , they neglect potentially relevant information .",
    "vertices belonging to more communities are likely to play an important role of intermediation between different compartments of the graph . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show a network of word association derived starting from the word `` bright '' .",
    "the network builds on the university of south florida free association norms  @xcite .",
    "an edge between words @xmath9 and @xmath10 indicates that some people associate @xmath10 to the word @xmath9 .",
    "the graph clearly displays four communities , corresponding to the categories _ intelligence _ , _ astronomy _ , _ light _ and _ colors_. the word `` bright '' is related to all of them by construction .",
    "other words belong to more categories , e.g. `` dark '' ( colors and light ) . accounting for overlapping communities introduces a further variable , the membership of vertices in different communities , which enormously increases the number of possible covers with respect to standard partitions .",
    "therefore , searching for overlapping communities is usually much more computationally demanding than detecting standard partitions .",
    "overlapping communities in a network of word association .",
    "the groups , labeled by the colors , were detected with the clique percolation method by palla et al .",

    "]    so far we have discussed examples of unipartite graphs . however , it is not uncommon to find real networks with different classes of vertices , and edges joining only vertices of different classes .",
    "an example is a network of scientists and papers , where edges join scientists and the papers they have authored .",
    "here there is no edge between any pair of scientists or papers , so the graph is bipartite . for a multipartite network",
    "the concept of community does not change much with respect to the case of unipartite graphs , as it remains related to a large density of edges between members of the same group , with the only difference that the elements of each group belong to different vertex classes .",
    "multipartite graphs are usually reduced to unipartite projections of each vertex class .",
    "for instance , from the bipartite network of scientists and papers one can extract a network of scientists only , who are related by coauthorship .",
    "in this way one can adopt standard techniques of network analysis , in particular standard clustering methods , but a lot of information gets lost .",
    "detecting communities in multipartite networks can have interesting applications in , e.g. , marketing .",
    "large shopping networks , in which customers are linked to the products they have bought , allow to classify customers based on the types of product they purchase more often : this could be used both to organize targeted advertising , as well as to give recommendations about future purchases  @xcite .",
    "the problem of community detection in multipartite networks is not trivial , and usually requires _",
    "ad hoc _ methodologies .",
    "[ fig7 ] illustrates the famous bipartite network of southern women studied by davis et al .",
    "there are @xmath11 vertices , representing @xmath12 women from the area of natchez , mississippi , and @xmath13 social events .",
    "edges represent the participation of the women in the events . from the figure",
    "one can see that the network has a clear community structure .",
    "community structure in multipartite networks .",
    "this bipartite graph refers to the southern women event participation data set .",
    "women are represented as open symbols with black labels , events as filled symbols with white labels .",
    "the illustrated vertex partition has been obtained by maximizing a modified version of the modularity by newman and girvan , tailored on bipartite graphs  @xcite ( section  [ sub_sec6_01 ] ) . reprinted figure with permission from ref .",

    "]    in some of the previous examples , edges have ( or can have ) weights .",
    "for instance , the edges of the collaboration network of fig .",
    "[ fig3]b could be weighted by the number of papers coauthored by pairs of scientists .",
    "similarly , the edges of the word association network of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are weighted by the number of times pairs of words have been associated by people .",
    "weights are precious additional information on a graph , and should be considered in the analysis . in",
    "many cases methods working on unweighted graphs can be simply extended to the weighted case .",
    "the problem of graph clustering , intuitive at first sight , is actually not well defined .",
    "the main elements of the problem themselves , i.  e. the concepts of community and partition , are not rigorously defined , and require some degree of arbitrariness and/or common sense . indeed , some ambiguities are hidden and there are often many equally legitimate ways of resolving them .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that there are plenty of recipes in the literature and that people do not even try to ground the problem on shared definitions .",
    "it is important to stress that the identification of structural clusters is possible only if graphs are _ sparse _",
    ", i.  e. if the number of edges @xmath14 is of the order of the number of nodes @xmath15 of the graph . if @xmath16 , the distribution of edges among the nodes is too homogeneous for communities to make sense . in this case",
    "the problem turns into something rather different , close to data clustering  @xcite , which requires concepts and methods of a different nature .",
    "the main difference is that , while communities in graphs are related , explicitly or implicitly , to the concept of edge density ( inside versus outside the community ) , in data clustering communities are sets of points which are `` close '' to each other , with respect to a measure of distance or similarity , defined for each pair of points . some classical techniques for data clustering , like _ hierarchical _ , _ partitional _ and _ spectral clustering _ will be discussed later in the review ( sections  [ sec4_2 ] , [ sec4_3 ] and  [ sec4_4 ] ) , as they are sometimes adopted for graph clustering too .",
    "other standard procedures for data clustering include _ neural network clustering _ techniques like , e. g. , _ self - organizing maps _ and _ multi - dimensional scaling _ techniques like , e. g. , _ singular value decomposition _ and _ principal component analysis _  @xcite .    in this section we shall attempt an ordered exposition of the fundamental concepts of community detection . after a brief discussion of the issue of computational complexity for the algorithms , we shall review the notions of community and partition .",
    "the massive amount of data on real networks currently available makes the issue of the efficiency of clustering algorithms essential .",
    "the _ computational complexity _ of an algorithm is the estimate of the amount of resources required by the algorithm to perform a task .",
    "this involves both the number of computation steps needed and the number of memory units that need to be simultaneously allocated to run the computation .",
    "such demands are usually expressed by their scalability with the size of the system at study . in the case of a graph ,",
    "the size is typically indicated by the number of vertices @xmath15 and/or the number of edges @xmath14 .",
    "the computational complexity of an algorithm can not always be calculated .",
    "in fact , sometimes this is a very hard task , or even impossible . in these cases , it is however important to have at least an estimate of the _ worst - case _ complexity of the algorithm , which is the amount of computational resources needed to run the algorithm in the most unfavorable case for a given system size .",
    "the notation @xmath17 indicates that the computer time grows as a power of both the number of vertices and edges , with exponents @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "ideally , one would like to have the lowest possible values for the exponents , which would correspond to the lowest possible computational demands .",
    "samples of the web graph , with millions of vertices and billions of edges , can not be tackled by algorithms whose running time grows faster than @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "algorithms with polynomial complexity form the class * p*. for some important decision and optimization problems , there are no known polynomial algorithms .",
    "finding solutions of such problems in the worst - case scenario may demand an exhaustive search , which takes a time growing faster than any polynomial function of the system size , e.g. exponentially .",
    "problems whose solutions can be verified in a polynomial time span the class * np * of _ non - deterministic polynomial time _",
    "problems , which includes * p*. a problem is * np*-hard if a solution for it can be translated into a solution for any * np*-problem .",
    "however , a * np*-hard problem needs not be in the class * np*. if it does belong to * np * it is called * np*-complete .",
    "the class of * np*-complete problems has drawn a special attention in computer science , as it includes many famous problems like the travelling salesman , boolean satisfiability ( sat ) , linear programming , etc .",
    "the fact that * np * problems have a solution which is verifiable in polynomial time does not mean that * np * problems have polynomial complexity , i. e. , that they are in * p*. in fact , the question of whether * np*=*p * is the most important open problem in theoretical computer science .",
    "* np*-hard problems need not be in * np * ( in which case they would be * np*-complete ) , but they are at least as hard as * np*-complete problems , so they are unlikely to have polynomial complexity , although a proof of that is still missing .",
    "many clustering algorithms or problems related to clustering are * np*-hard . in this case",
    ", it is pointless to use exact algorithms , which could be applied only to very small systems .",
    "moreover , even if an algorithm has a polynomial complexity , it may still be too slow to tackle large systems of interest . in all such cases",
    "it is common to use _ approximation algorithms _ , i.  e. methods that do not deliver an exact solution to the problem at hand , but only an approximate solution , with the advantage of a lower complexity .",
    "approximation algorithms are often non - deterministic , as they deliver different solutions for the same problem , for different initial conditions and/or parameters of the algorithm .",
    "the goal of such algorithms is to deliver a solution which differs by a constant factor from the optimal solution . in any case",
    ", one should give provable bounds on the goodness of the approximate solution delivered by the algorithm with respect to the optimal solution .",
    "in many cases it is not possible to approximate the solution within any constant , as the goodness of the approximation strongly depends on the specific problem at study .",
    "approximation algorithms are commonly used for optimization problems , in which one wants to find the maximum or minimum value of a given cost function over a large set of possible system configurations .",
    "the first problem in graph clustering is to look for a quantitative definition of community .",
    "no definition is universally accepted . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the definition often depends on the specific system at hand and/or application one has in mind . from intuition and the examples of section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we get the notion that there must be more edges `` inside '' the community than edges linking vertices of the community with the rest of the graph .",
    "this is the reference guideline at the basis of most community definitions .",
    "but many alternative recipes are compatible with it . moreover , in most cases , communities are algorithmically defined , i.  e. they are just the final product of the algorithm , without a precise _ a priori _ definition .",

    "four types of criteria were identified : _ complete mutuality _ , _",

    "social communities can be defined in a very strict sense as subgroups whose members are all `` friends '' to each other  @xcite ( complete mutuality ) . in graph terms , this corresponds to a _ clique _ , i.  e. a subset whose vertices are all adjacent to each other . in social network analysis ,",
    "a clique is a maximal subgraph , whereas in graph theory it is common to call cliques also non - maximal subgraphs .",
    "triangles are the simplest cliques , and are frequent in real networks .",
    "but larger cliques are less frequent .",
    "moreover , the condition is really too strict : a subgraph with all possible internal edges except one would be an extremely cohesive subgroup , but it would not be considered a community under this recipe .",
    "another problem is that all vertices of a clique are absolutely symmetric , with no differentiation between them .",
    "in many practical examples , instead , we expect that within a community there is a whole hierarchy of roles for the vertices , with core vertices coexisting with peripheral ones .",
    "we remark that vertices may belong to more cliques simultaneously , a property which is at the basis of the clique percolation method of palla et al .",
    "@xcite ( see section  [ sec45_1 ] ) . from a practical point of view , finding cliques in a graph is an * np*-complete problem  @xcite .",
    "the bron - kerbosch method  @xcite runs in a time growing exponentially with the size of the graph .",
    "it is however possible to relax the notion of clique , defining subgroups which are still clique - like objects .",
    "a possibility is to use properties related to reachability , i.  e. to the existence ( and length ) of paths between vertices . an _",

    "one recovers the definition of clique , as all vertices are adjacent , so each geodesic path between any pair of vertices has length @xmath2 .",
    "this definition , more flexible than that of clique , still has some limitations , deriving from the fact that the geodesic paths need not run on the vertices of the subgraph at study , but may run on vertices outside the subgraph .",
    "in this way , there may be two disturbing consequences .",
    "first , the diameter of the subgraph may exceed @xmath15 , even if in principle each vertex of the subgraph is less than @xmath15 steps away from any of the others .",
    "second , the subgraph may be disconnected , which is not consistent with the notion of cohesion one tries to enforce . to avoid these problems , mokken",
    "@xcite has suggested two possible alternatives , the _ @xmath15-clan _ and the _ @xmath15-club_. an @xmath15-clan is an @xmath15-clique whose diameter is not larger than @xmath15 , i.  e. a subgraph such that the distance between any two of its vertices , computed over shortest paths within the subgraph , does not exceed @xmath15 .",

    "the two definitions are quite close : the difference is that an @xmath15-clan is maximal under the constraint of being an @xmath15-clique , whereas an @xmath15-club is maximal under the constraint imposed by the length of the diameter .",
    "another criterion for subgraph cohesion relies on the adjacency of its vertices .",
    "the idea is that a vertex must be adjacent to some minumum number of other vertices in the subgraph . in the literature on social network analysis",

    "therefore , it is important to compare the internal and external cohesion of a subgraph .",
    "in fact , this is what is usually done in the most recent definitions of community . the first recipe , however , is not recent and stems from social network analysis .",
    "an _ @xmath49-set _",

    "@xcite , is a subgraph such that the internal degree of each vertex is greater than its external degree .",
    "this condition is quite strict and can be relaxed into the so - called _ weak _ definition of community  @xcite , for which it suffices that the internal degree of the subgraph exceeds its external degree .",

    "hu et al .",
    "@xcite have introduced alternative definitions of strong and weak communities : a community is strong if the internal degree of any vertex of the community exceeds the number of edges that the vertex shares with any other community ; a community is weak if its total internal degree exceeds the number of edges shared by the community with the other communities .",
    "these definitions are in the same spirit of the _ planted partition model _",

    "another definition focuses on the robustness of clusters to edge removal and uses the concept of _ edge connectivity_. the edge connectivity of a pair of vertices in a graph is the minimal number of edges that need to be removed in order to disconnect the two vertices , i.  e. such that there is no path between them .",
    "lambda set _ is a subgraph such that any pair of vertices of the subgraph has a larger edge connectivity than any pair formed by one vertex of the subgraph and one outside the subgraph  @xcite .",
    "however , vertices of a lambda - set need not be adjacent and may be quite distant from each other .",
    "communities can also be identified by a _",

    "the larger the fitness , the more definite is the community .",
    "this is the same principle behind _ quality functions _ , which give an estimate of the goodness of a graph partition ( see section  [ sec3_2_2 ] ) .",
    "the simplest fitness measure for a cluster is its intra - cluster density @xmath36 .",
    "one could assume that a subgraph @xmath22 with @xmath44 vertices is a cluster if @xmath36 is larger than a threshold , say @xmath50 .",
    "finding such subgraphs is an * np*-complete problem , as it coincides with the * np*-complete clique problem when the threshold @xmath51",
    "it is better to fix the size of the subgraph because , without this conditions , any clique would be one of the best possible communities , including trivial two - cliques ( simple edges ) .",
    "variants of this problem focus on the number of internal edges of the subgraph  @xcite .",

    "finding subgraphs of a given size with @xmath52 larger than a threshold is * np*-complete  @xcite .",
    "fitness measures can also be associated to the connectivity of the subgraph at study to the other vertices of the graph .",
    "a good community is expected to have a small cut size ( see section  [ sec1_1 ] ) , i.  e. a small number of edges joining it to the rest of the graph .",
    "this sets a bridge between community detection and graph partitioning , which we shall discuss in section  [ sec4_1 ] .",
    "communities can also be defined with respect to the graph as a whole .",
    "this is reasonable in those cases in which clusters are essential parts of the graph , which can not be taken apart without seriously affecting the functioning of the system .",
    "the literature offers many global criteria to identify communities . in most cases they are indirect definitions , in which some global property of the graph is used in an algorithm that delivers communities at the end .",
    "however , there is a class of proper definitions , based on the idea that a graph has community structure if it is different from a random graph .",
    "a random graph  la erds - rnyi ( section  [ sec1_3 ] ) , for instance , is not expected to have community structure , as any two vertices have the same probability to be adjacent , so there should be no preferential linking involving special groups of vertices .",
    "therefore , one can define a _",
    "null model _ ,",
    "i.  e. a graph which matches the original in some of its structural features , but which is otherwise a random graph .",
    "the null model is used as a term of comparison , to verify whether the graph at study displays community structure or not .",
    "the most popular null model is that proposed by newman and girvan and consists of a randomized version of the original graph , where edges are rewired at random , under the constraint that the expected degree of each vertex matches the degree of the vertex in the original graph  @xcite .",
    "this null model is the basic concept behind the definition of _ modularity _ , a function which evaluates the goodness of partitions of a graph into clusters .",
    "modularity will be discussed at length in this review , because it has the unique privilege of being at the same time a global criterion to define a community , a quality function and the key ingredient of the most popular method of graph clustering . in the standard formulation of modularity ,",
    "a subgraph is a community if the number of edges inside the subgraph exceeds the expected number of internal edges that the same subgraph would have in the null model .",
    "this expected number is an average over all possible realizations of the null model .",
    "several modifications of modularity have been proposed ( section  [ sub_sec6_01 ] ) .",
    "a general class of null models , including modularity as a special case , has been designed by reichardt and bornholdt  @xcite ( section  [ sub_sec6_01 ] ) .",
    "it is natural to assume that communities are groups of vertices similar to each other .",
    "one can compute the similarity between each pair of vertices with respect to some reference property , local or global , no matter whether they are connected by an edge or not .",
    "each vertex ends up in the cluster whose vertices are most similar to it .",
    "similarity measures are at the basis of traditional methods , like hierarchical , partitional and spectral clustering , to be discussed in sections  [ sec4_2 ] , [ sec4_3 ] and [ sec4_4 ] . here",
    "we discuss some popular measures used in the literature .",
    "if it is possible to embed the graph vertices in an @xmath15-dimensional euclidean space , by assigning a position to them , one could use the _ distance _ between a pair of vertices as a measure of their similarity ( it is actually a measure of dissimilarity because similar vertices are expected to be close to each other ) . given the two data points @xmath53 and @xmath54 , one could use any norm @xmath55 , like the _ euclidean distance _ ( @xmath56-norm ) , @xmath57 the _ manhattan distance _ (",

    "a possibility is to define a distance  @xcite between vertices like @xmath66 where * a * is the adjacency matrix .",
    "this is a dissimilarity measure , based on the concept of structural equivalence  @xcite .",
    "two vertices are structurally equivalent if they have the same neighbors , even if they are not adjacent themselves . if @xmath67 and @xmath68 are structurally equivalent , @xmath69",
    ". vertices with large degree and different neighbours are considered very `` far '' from each other .",
    "alternatively , one could measure the _ overlap _ between the neighborhoods @xmath70 and @xmath71 of vertices @xmath67 and @xmath68 , given by the ratio between the intersection and the union of the neighborhoods , i.  e. @xmath72 another measure related to structural equivalence is the pearson correlation between columns or rows of the adjacency matrix , @xmath73 where the averages @xmath74 and the variances @xmath75 .",
    "an alternative measure is the number of edge- ( or vertex- ) independent paths between two vertices .",
    "independent paths do not share any edge ( vertex ) , and their number is related to the maximum flow that can be conveyed between the two vertices under the constraint that each edge can carry only one unit of flow ( max - flow / min - cut theorem  @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum flow can be calculated in a time @xmath21 , for a graph with @xmath14 edges , using techniques like the augmenting path algorithm  @xcite .",
    "similarly , one could consider all paths running between two vertices . in this case",
    ", there is the problem that the total number of paths is infinite , but this can be avoided if one performs a weighted sum of the number of paths .",
    "for instance , paths of length @xmath76 can be weighted by the factor @xmath77 , with @xmath78 .",
    "another possibility , suggested by estrada and hatano  @xcite , is to weigh paths of length @xmath76 with the inverse factorial @xmath79 . in both cases ,",
    "the contribution of long paths is strongly suppressed and the sum converges .    another important class of measures of vertex similarity is based on properties of random walks on graphs .",
    "one of this properties is the _ commute - time _ between a pair of vertices , which is the average number of steps needed for a random walker , starting at either vertex , to reach the other vertex for the first time and to come back to the starting vertex .",
    "saerens and coworkers  @xcite have extensively studied and used the commute - time ( and variants thereof ) as ( dis)similarity measure : the larger the time , the farther ( less similar ) the vertices .",
    "the commute - time is closely related  @xcite to the _ resistance distance _ introduced by klein and randic  @xcite , expressing the effective electrical resistance between two vertices if the graph is turned into a resistor network .",
    "white and smyth  @xcite and zhou  @xcite used instead the average first passage time , i. e. the average number of steps needed to reach for the first time the target vertex from the source .",
    "harel and koren  @xcite proposed to build measures out of quantities like the probability to visit a target vertex in no more than a given number of steps after it leaves a source vertex ) and in a recent analysis by nadler et al .",
    "@xcite , one defined a dissimilarity measure called `` diffusion distance '' , which is derived from the probability that the walker visits the target after a fixed number of steps . ] and the probability that a random walker starting at a source visits the target exactly once before hitting the source again .",
    "another quantity used to define similarity measures is the _ escape probability _ , defined as the probability that the walker reaches the target vertex before coming back to the source vertex  @xcite .",
    "the escape probability is related to the effective conductance between the two vertices in the equivalent resistor network .",
    "other authors have exploited properties of modified random walks .",
    "for instance , the algorithm by gori and pucci  @xcite and that by tong et al .",
    "@xcite used similarity measures derived from google s pagerank process  @xcite .        a _ partition _ is a division of a graph in clusters , such that each vertex belongs to one cluster .",
    "as we have seen in section  [ sec2 ] , in real systems vertices may be shared among different communities .",
    "a division of a graph into overlapping ( or _ fuzzy _ ) communities is called _",

    ", it is often possible to define a distance function . on a generic graph , except for the first property , which does not make sense without a distance function , the other two are quite well defined .",
    "the property of richness implies that , given a partition , one can set edges between the vertices in such a way that the partition is a natural outcome of the resulting graph ( e.g. , it could be achieved by setting edges only between vertices of the same cluster ) .",
    "consistency here implies that deleting inter - cluster edges and adding intra - cluster edges yields the same partition .",
    "many algorithms are able to identify a subset of meaningful partitions , ideally one or just a few , whereas some others , like techniques based on hierarchical clustering ( section  [ sec4_2 ] ) , deliver a large number of partitions .",
    "that does not mean that the partitions found are equally good .",
    "therefore it is helpful ( sometimes even necessary ) to have a quantitative _ criterion _ to assess the goodness of a graph partition .",
    "quality function _ is a function that assigns a number to each partition of a graph . in this way one can rank partitions based on their score given by the quality function .",
    "partitions with high scores are `` good '' , so the one with the largest score is by definition the best .",
    "nevertheless , one should keep in mind that the question of when a partition is better than another one is ill - posed , and the answer depends on the specific concept of community and/or quality function adopted .    a quality function @xmath90 is _ additive _ if there is an elementary function @xmath91 such that , for any partition @xmath92 of a graph @xmath93 where @xmath22 is a generic cluster of partition @xmath94 .",

    "another example is _ coverage _ , i.  e. the ratio of the number of intra - community edges by the total number of edges : by definition , an ideal cluster structure , where the clusters are disconnected from each other , yields a coverage of @xmath2 , as all edges of the graph fall within clusters .",
    "the most popular quality function is the modularity of newman and girvan  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the idea that a random graph is not expected to have a cluster structure , so the possible existence of clusters is revealed by the comparison between the actual density of edges in a subgraph and the density one would expect to have in the subgraph if the vertices of the graph were attached regardless of community structure .",
    "this expected edge density depends on the chosen _ null model _ , i.  e. a copy of the original graph keeping some of its structural properties but without community structure .",
    "modularity can then be written as follows @xmath99 where the sum runs over all pairs of vertices , @xmath9 is the adjacency matrix , @xmath14 the total number of edges of the graph , and @xmath100 represents the expected number of edges between vertices @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the null model",
    ". the @xmath101-function yields one if vertices @xmath67 and @xmath68 are in the same community ( @xmath102 ) , zero otherwise .",
    "the choice of the null model graph is in principle arbitrary , and several possibilities exist .",
    "for instance , one could simply demand that the graph keeps the same number of edges as the original graph , and that edges are placed with the same probability between any pair of vertices . in this case ( bernoulli random graph ) , the null model term in eq .",
    "[ eq : mod_0 ] would be a constant ( i.  e. @xmath103 $ ] , @xmath104 ) .",
    "however this null model is not a good descriptor of real networks , as it has a poissonian degree distribution which is very different from the skewed distributions found in real networks . due to the important implications that broad degree distributions have for the structure and function of real networks  @xcite , it is preferable to go for a null model with the same degree distribution of the original graph .",
    "the standard null model of modularity imposes that the expected degree sequence ( after averaging over all possible configurations of the model ) matches the actual degree sequence of the graph .",
    "this is a stricter constraint than merely requiring the match of the degree distributions , and is essentially equivalent   to the _ configuration model _ , which has been subject of intense investigations in the recent literature on networks  @xcite . in this null model , a vertex",
    "could be attached to any other vertex of the graph and the probability that vertices @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with degrees @xmath105 and @xmath106 , are connected , can be calculated without problems .",
    "in fact , in order to form an edge between @xmath67 and @xmath68 one needs to join two _ stubs _ ( i.  e. half - edges ) , incident with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the probability @xmath107 to pick at random a stub incident with @xmath67 is @xmath108 , as there are @xmath105 stubs incident with @xmath67 out of a total of @xmath109 .",

    "this problem can be actually avoided by choosing a different measure to optimize for the partitioning , which accounts for the size of the clusters . some of these measures will be briefly introduced at the end of this section .",

    "@xcite is one of the earliest methods proposed and is still frequently used , often in combination with other techniques .",
    "the authors were motivated by the problem of partitioning electronic circuits onto boards : the nodes contained in different boards need to be linked to each other with the least number of connections .",
    "the procedure is an optimization of a benefit function @xmath90 , which represents the difference between the number of edges inside the modules and the number of edges lying between them .",
    "the starting point is an initial partition of the graph in two clusters of the predefined size : such initial partition can be random or suggested by some information on the graph structure .",
    "then , subsets consisting of equal numbers of vertices are swapped between the two groups , so that @xmath90 has the maximal increase .",
    "the subsets can consist of single vertices . to reduce the risk to be trapped in local maxima of @xmath90 , the procedure includes some swaps that decrease the function @xmath90 .",
    "after a series of swaps with positive and negative gains , the partition with the largest value of @xmath90 is selected and used as starting point of a new series of iterations .",
    "the kernighan - lin algorithm is quite fast , scaling as @xmath128 ( @xmath15 being as usual the number of vertices ) , if only a constant number of swaps are performed at each iteration .",
    "the most expensive part is the identification of the subsets to swap , which requires the computation of the gains / losses for any pair of candidate subsets . on sparse graphs ,",
    "a slightly different heuristic allows to lower the complexity to @xmath129 .",
    "the partitions found by the procedure are strongly dependent on the initial configuration and other algorithms can do better . it is preferable to start with a good guess about the sought partition , otherwise the results are quite poor . therefore the method is typically used to improve on the partitions found through other techniques , by using them as starting configurations for the algorithm .",
    "the kernighan - lin algorithm has been extended to extract partitions in any number of parts  @xcite , however the run - time and storage costs increase rapidly with the number of clusters .",
    "another popular technique is the _ spectral bisection method _",
    "@xcite , which is based on the properties of the spectrum of the laplacian matrix .",
    "spectral clustering will be discussed more thoroughly in section  [ sec4_4 ] , here we focus on its application to graph partitioning .    every partition of a graph with @xmath15 vertices in two groups can be represented by an index vector @xmath130 , whose component @xmath131 is @xmath132 if vertex @xmath67 is in one group and @xmath133 if it is in the other group . the cut size @xmath134 of the partition of the graph in the two groups can be written as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the laplacian matrix and @xmath137 the transpose of vector @xmath130 .",

    "it is worth remarking that the sum contains at most @xmath143 terms , as the laplacian has at least one zero eigenvalue . minimizing @xmath134 equals to the minimization of the sum on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "this task is still very hard .",
    "however , if the second lowest eigenvector @xmath144 is close enough to zero , a good approximation of the minimum can be attained by choosing @xmath130 parallel to the corresponding eigenvector @xmath145 , which is called _ fiedler vector _",
    "@xcite : this would reduce the sum to @xmath144 , which is a small number .",
    "but the index vector can not be perfectly parallel to @xmath145 by construction , because all its components are equal in modulus , whereas the components of @xmath145 are not .",
    "the best choice is to match the signs of the components .",

    "it may happen that the sizes of the two corresponding groups do not match the predefined sizes one wishes to have . in this case , if one aims at a split in @xmath149 and @xmath150 vertices , the best strategy is to order the components of the fiedler vector from the lowest to the largest values and to put in one group the vertices corresponding to the first @xmath149 components from the top or the bottom , and the remaining vertices in the second group .",
    "this procedure yields two partitions : the better solution is naturally the one that gives the smaller cut size .",

    "algorithms for graph partitioning are not good for community detection , because it is necessary to provide as input the number of groups and in some cases even their sizes , about which in principle one knows nothing .",
    "instead , one would like an algorithm capable to produce this information in its output .",
    "besides , from the methodological point of view , using iterative bisectioning to split the graph in more pieces is not a reliable procedure . for instance , a split into three clusters is necessarily obtained by breaking either cluster of the original bipartition in two parts , whereas in many cases a minimum cut partition is obtained if the third cluster is a merger of parts of both initial clusters .      in general , very little is known about the community structure of a graph .",
    "it is uncommon to know the number of clusters in which the graph is split , or other indications about the membership of the vertices .",
    "in such cases clustering procedures like graph partitioning methods can hardly be of help , and one is forced to make some reasonable assumptions about the number and size of the clusters , which are often unjustified . on the other hand",

    "we have listed several possible definitions of similarity .",
    "hierarchical clustering techniques aim at identifying groups of vertices with high similarity , and can be classified in two categories :    1 .",

    "_ divisive algorithms _ , in which clusters are iteratively split by removing edges connecting vertices with low similarity .",
    "the two classes refer to opposite processes : agglomerative algorithms are bottom - up , as one starts from the vertices as separate clusters ( singletons ) and ends up with the graph as a unique cluster ; divisive algorithms are top - down as they follow the opposite direction .",
    "divisive techniques have been rarely used in the past ( meanwhile they have become more popular , see section  [ sec5 ] ) , so we shall concentrate here on agglomerative algorithms .    since clusters are merged based on their mutual similarity",
    ", it is essential to define a measure that estimates how similar clusters are , out of the matrix @xmath168 .",
    "this involves some arbitrariness and several prescriptions exist . in _ single linkage clustering _ , the similarity between two groups is the minimum element @xmath169 , with @xmath67 in one group and @xmath68 in the other . on the contrary , the maximum element @xmath169 for vertices of different groups",
    "is used in the procedure of _ complete linkage clustering_. in _ average linkage clustering _",

    "hierarchical clustering has the advantage that it does not require a preliminary knowledge on the number and size of the clusters .",
    "however , it does not provide a way to discriminate between the many partitions obtained by the procedure , and to choose that or those that better represent the community structure of the graph .",
    "the results of the method depend on the specific similarity measure adopted .",
    "the procedure also yields a hierarchical structure by construction , which is rather artificial in most cases , since the graph at hand may not have a hierarchical structure at all .",
    "moreover , vertices of a community may not be correctly classified , and in many cases some vertices are missed even if they have a central role in their clusters  @xcite .",
    "another problem is that vertices with just one neighbor are often classified as separated clusters , which in most cases does not make sense .",
    "finally , a major weakness of agglomerative hierarchical clustering is that it does not scale well . if points are embedded in space , so that one can use the distance as dissimilarity measure , the computational complexity is @xmath129 for single linkage , @xmath128 for the complete and average linkage schemes . for graph clustering ,",

    "spectral clustering is able to separate data points that could not be resolved by applying directly @xmath44-means clustering , for instance , as the latter tends to deliver convex sets of points .",
    "the first contribution on spectral clustering was a paper by donath and hoffmann  @xcite , who used the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix for graph partitions .",
    "in the same year , fiedler  @xcite realized that from the eigenvector of the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix it was possible to obtain a bipartition of the graph with very low cut size , as we have explained in section  [ sec4_1 ] .",

    "@xcite . in this section",
    "we shall follow the nice tutorial by von luxburg  @xcite , with a focus on spectral graph clustering .",

    "the laplacian is by far the most used matrix in spectral clustering . in section  [ sec1_2 ]",
    "we see that the unnormalized laplacian of a graph with @xmath44 connected components has @xmath44 zero eigenvalues . in this case",
    "the laplacian can be written in block - diagonal form , i.  e. the vertices can be ordered in such a way that the laplacian displays @xmath44 square blocks along the diagonal , with ( some ) entries different from zero , whereas all other elements vanish .",
    "each block is the laplacian of the corresponding subgraph , so it has the trivial eigenvector with components @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath44 degenerate eigenvectors with equal non - vanishing components in correspondence of the vertices of a block , whereas all other components are zero . in this way , from the components of the eigenvectors one can identify the connected components of the graph .",
    "for instance , let us consider the @xmath186 matrix , whose columns are the @xmath44 eigenvectors above mentioned .",
    "the @xmath67-th row of this matrix is a vector with @xmath44 components representing vertex @xmath67 of the graph .",
    "vectors representing vertices in the same connected component of the graph coincide , and their tip lies on one of the axes of a @xmath44-dimensional system of coordinates ( i. e. they are all vectors of the form @xmath187 ) .",
    "so , by drawing the vertex vectors one would see @xmath44 distinct points , each on a different axis , corresponding to the graph components .    if the graph is connected , but consists of @xmath44 subgraphs which are weakly linked to each other , the spectrum of the unnormalized laplacian will have one zero eigenvalue , all others being positive . now",
    "the laplacian can not be put in block - diagonal form : even if one enumerates the vertices in the order of their cluster memberships ( by listing first the vertices of one cluster , then the vertices of another cluster , etc . )",
    "there will always be some non - vanishing entries outside of the blocks .",
    "however , the lowest @xmath188 non - vanishing eigenvalues are still close to zero , and the vertex vectors of the first @xmath44 eigenvectors should still enable one to clearly distinguish the clusters in a @xmath44-dimensional space .",
    "vertex vectors corresponding to the same cluster are now not coincident , in general , but still rather close to each other .",
    "so , instead of @xmath44 points , one would observe @xmath44 groups of points , with the points of each group localized close to each other and far from the other groups .",
    "techniques like @xmath44-means clustering ( section  [ sec4_3 ] ) can then easily recover the clusters .",
    "the scenario we have described is expected from perturbation theory  @xcite . in principle",
    "all symmetric matrices that can be put in block - diagonal form have a set of eigenvectors ( as many as the blocks ) , such that the elements of each eigenvector are different from zero on the vertices of a block and zero otherwise , just like the laplacian .",
    "the adjacency matrix itself has the same property , for example .",
    "this is a necessary condition for the eigenvectors to be successfully used for graph clustering , but it is not sufficient . in the case of the laplacian , for a graph with @xmath44 connected components , we know that the eigenvectors corresponding to the @xmath44 lowest eigenvalues come each from one of the components . in the case of the adjacency matrix @xmath189 ( or of its weighted counterpart @xmath190 ) , instead",
    ", it may happen that large eigenvalues refer to the same component .",
    "so , if one takes the eigenvectors corresponding to the @xmath44 largest eigenvalues , where @xmath191 is the diagonal matrix whose elements are the vertex degrees . ] , some components will be overrepresented , while others will be absent .",
    "therefore , using the eigenvectors of @xmath189 ( or @xmath190 ) in spectral graph clustering is in general not reliable .",
    "moreover , the elements of the eigenvectors corresponding to the components should be sufficiently far from zero . to understand why , suppose that we take a ( symmetric , block - diagonal ) matrix , and that one or more elements of one of the eigenvectors corresponding to the connected components are very close to zero .",
    "if one perturbs the graph by adding edges between different components , all entries of the perturbed eigenvectors will become non - zero and some may have comparable values as the lowest elements of the eigenvectors on the blocks . therefore distinguishing vertices of different components may become a problem , even when the perturbation is fairly small , and misclassifications are likely . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - vanishing elements of the ( normalized ) eigenvectors of the unnormalized laplacian , for instance , are all equal to @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the number of vertices in the @xmath67-th component . in this way",
    ", there is a gap between the lowest element ( here they are all equal for the same eigenvector ) and zero .",
    "this holds as well for the normalized laplacian @xmath194 ( section  [ sec1_2 ] ) . for the other normalized laplacian @xmath195 ( section  [ sec1_2 ] ) , the non - zero elements of the eigenvectors corresponding to the connected components are proportional to the square root of the degree of the corresponding vertex",
    "so , if degrees are very different from each other , and especially if there are vertices with very low degree , some eigenvector elements may be quite small . as we shall see below , in the context of the technique by ng et al .",
    "@xcite , a suitable normalization procedure is introduced to alleviate this problem .",
    "now that we have explained why the laplacian matrix is particularly suitable for spectral clustering , we proceed with the description of three popular methods : _ unnormalized spectral clustering _ and two _ normalized spectral clustering _",
    "techniques , proposed by shi and malik  @xcite and by ng et al .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "unnormalized spectral clustering uses the unnormalized laplacian @xmath136 .",
    "the inputs are the adjacency matrix @xmath189 ( @xmath190 for weighted graphs ) and the number @xmath44 of clusters to be recovered .",
    "the first step consists in computing the eigenvectors corresponding to the lowest @xmath44 eigenvalues of @xmath136 .",
    "then , one builds the @xmath186 matrix @xmath196 , whose columns are the @xmath44 eigenvectors . the @xmath15 rows of @xmath196 are used to represent the graph vertices in a @xmath44-dimensional euclidean space , through a cartesian system of coordinates .",
    "the points are then grouped in @xmath44 clusters by using @xmath44-means clustering or similar techniques ( section  [ sec4_3 ] ) .",
    "normalized spectral clustering works in the same way . in the version by shi and malik  @xcite ,",
    "one uses the eigenvectors of the normalized laplacian @xmath194 ( section  [ sec1_2 ] ) . in the algorithm by ng et al .",
    "@xcite one adopts the normalized laplacian @xmath195 ( section  [ sec1_2 ] ) . here",
    ", however , the matrix @xmath196 is normalized by dividing the elements of each row by their sum , obtaining a new matrix @xmath197 , whose rows are then used to represent the vertices in space , as in the other methods . by doing so , it is much more unlikely that eigenvector components for a well - separated cluster are close to zero , a scenario which would make the classification of the corresponding vertices problematic , as we have said above .",
    "however , if the graph has some vertices with low degree , they may still be misclassified .",
    "spectral clustering is closely related to graph partitioning .",
    "relaxed versions of the minimization of ratio cut and normalized cut ( see section  [ sec4_1 ] ) can be turned into spectral clustering problems , by following similar procedures as in spectral graph partitioning .",
    "the measure to minimize can be expressed in matrix form , obtaining similar expressions as for the cut size ( see eq .",
    "[ eqr ] ) , with index vectors defining the partition of the graph in groups through the values of their entries .",
    "for instance , for the minimum cut bipartition of section  [ sec4_1 ] , there is only one index vector @xmath130 , whose components equal @xmath198 , where the signs indicate the two clusters .",
    "the relaxation consists in performing the minimization over all possible vectors @xmath130 , allowing for real - valued components as well .",
    "this version of the problem is exactly equivalent to spectral clustering .",
    "the relaxed minimization of ratio cut for a partition in @xmath44 clusters yields the @xmath15 @xmath44-dimensional vertex vectors of unnormalized spectral clustering  @xcite ; for normalized cut one obtains the @xmath15 @xmath44-dimensional vertex vectors of normalized spectral clustering , with the normalized laplacian @xmath194  @xcite .",
    "the problem is then to turn the resulting vectors into a partition of the graph , which can be done by using techniques like @xmath44-means clustering , as we have seen above .",
    "however , it is still unclear what is the relation between the original minimum cut problem over actual graph partitions and the relaxed version of it , in particular how close one can come to the real solution via spectral clustering .",
    "random walks on graphs are also related to spectral clustering .",
    "in fact , by minimizing the number of edges between clusters ( properly normalized for measures like , e.  g. , ratio cut and normalized cut ) one forces random walkers to spend more time within clusters and to move more rarely from one cluster to another .",
    "in particular , unnormalized spectral clustering with the laplacian @xmath194 has a natural link with random walks , because @xmath199 ( section  [ sec1_2 ] ) , where @xmath200 is the transfer matrix @xmath201 . this has interesting consequences .",
    "for instance , meil and shi have proven that the normalized cut for a bipartition equals the total probability that a random walker moves from one of the clusters to the other in either sense  @xcite . in this way , minimizing the normalized cut means looking for a partition minimizing the probability of transitions between clusters .",
    "spectral clustering requires the computation of the first @xmath44 eigenvectors of a laplacian matrix .",
    "if the graph is large , an exact computation of the eigenvectors is impossible , as it would require a time @xmath154 .",
    "fortunately there are approximate techniques , like the power method or krylov subspace techniques like the lanczos method  @xcite , whose speed depends on the size of the eigengap @xmath151 , where @xmath202 and @xmath152 are the @xmath44-th and @xmath203-th smallest eigenvalue of the matrix .",
    "the larger the eigengap , the faster the convergence .",
    "in fact , the existence of large gaps between pairs of consecutive eigenvalues could suggest the number of clusters of the graph , an information which is not delivered by spectral clustering and which has to be given as input . we know that , for a disconnected graph with @xmath44 components , the first @xmath44 eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix ( normalized or not ) are zero , whether the @xmath203-th is non - zero .",
    "if the clusters are weakly connected to each other , one expects that the first @xmath44 eigenvalues remain close to zero , and that the @xmath203-th is clearly different from zero . by reversing this argument ,",
    "the number of clusters of a graph could be derived by checking whether there is an integer @xmath44 such that the first @xmath44 eigenvalues are small and the @xmath203-th is relatively large . however , when the clusters are very mixed with each other , it may be hard to identify significant gaps between the eigenvalues .",
    "the last issue we want to point out concerns the choice of the laplacian matrix to use in the applications .",
    "if the graph vertices have the same or similar degrees , there is no substantial difference between the unnormalized and the normalized laplacians .",
    "if there are big inhomogeneities among the vertex degrees , instead , the choice of the laplacian considerably affects the results . in general , normalized laplacians are more promising because the corresponding spectral clustering techniques implicitly impose a double optimization on the set of partitions , such that the intracluster edge density is high and , at the same time , the intercluster edge density is low . on the contrary",
    ", the unnormalized laplacian is related to the intercluster edge density only . moreover ,",
    "unnormalized spectral clustering does not always converge , and sometimes yields trivial partitions in which one or more clusters consist of a single vertex .",
    "of the normalized laplacians , @xmath194 is more reliable than @xmath195 because the eigenvectors of @xmath194 corresponding to the lowest eigenvalues are cluster indicator vectors , i. e. , they have equal non - vanishing entries in correspondence of the vertices of each cluster , and zero elsewhere , if the clusters are disconnected .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath195 , instead , are obtained by ( left- ) multiplying those of @xmath194 by the matrix @xmath204 : in this way , eigenvector components corresponding to vertices of the same cluster are no longer equal , in general , a complication that may induce artefacts in the spectral clustering procedure .",
    "a simple way to identify communities in a graph is to detect the edges that connect vertices of different communities and remove them , so that the clusters get disconnected from each other .",
    "this is the philosophy of divisive algorithms .",
    "the crucial point is to find a property of intercommunity edges that could allow for their identification .",
    "divisive methods do not introduce substantial conceptual advances with respect to traditional techniques , as they just perform hierarchical clustering on the graph at study ( section  [ sec4_2 ] ) . the main difference with divisive hierarchical clustering",
    "is that here one removes inter - cluster edges instead of edges between pairs of vertices with low similarity and there is no guarantee _ a priori _ that inter - cluster edges connect vertices with low similarity . in some cases vertices",
    "( with all their adjacent edges ) or whole subgraphs may be removed , instead of single edges . being hierarchical clustering techniques , it is customary to represent the resulting partitions by means of dendrograms .",
    "the most popular algorithm is that proposed by girvan and newman  @xcite .",
    "the method is historically important , because it marked the beginning of a new era in the field of community detection and opened this topic to physicists . here",
    "edges are selected according to the values of measures of _ edge centrality _ , estimating the importance of edges according to some property or process running on the graph .",
    "the steps of the algorithm are :    1 .",
    "computation of the centrality for all edges ; 2 .",
    "removal of edge with largest centrality : in case of ties with other edges , one of them is picked at random ; 3 .",
    "recalculation of centralities on the running graph ; 4 .",
    "iteration of the cycle from step 2 .",
    "girvan and newman focused on the concept of _ betweenness _ , which is a variable expressing the frequency of the participation of edges to a process .",
    "they considered three alternative definitions : geodesic edge betweenness , random - walk edge betweenness and current - flow edge betweenness . in",
    "the following we shall refer to them as edge betweenness , random - walk betweenness and current - flow betweenness , respectively .    edge betweenness is the number of shortest paths between all vertex pairs that run along the edge .",
    "it is an extension to edges of the popular concept of site betweenness , introduced by freeman in 1977  @xcite and expresses the importance of edges in processes like information spreading , where information usually flows through shortest paths .",
    "historically edge betweenness was introduced before site betweenness in a never published technical report by anthonisse  @xcite .",
    "it is intuitive that intercommunity edges have a large value of the edge betweenness , because many shortest paths connecting vertices of different communities will pass through them ( fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] ) . as in the calculation of site betweenness ,",
    "if there are two or more geodesic paths with the same endpoints that run through an edge , the contribution of each of them to the betweenness of the edge must be divided by the multiplicity of the paths , as one assumes that the signal / information propagates equally along each geodesic path .",
    "edge betweenness is highest for edges connecting communities . in the figure ,",
    "the edge in the middle has a much higher betweenness than all other edges , because all shortest paths connecting vertices of the two communities run through it .",
    "reprinted figure with permission from ref .",
    "2009 by springer . ]    the betweenness of all edges of the graph can be calculated in a time that scales as @xmath205 , or @xmath129 on a sparse graph , with techniques based on breadth - first - search  @xcite .    in the context of information spreading",
    ", one could imagine that signals flow across random rather than geodesic paths . in this case",
    "the betweenness of an edge is given by the frequency of the passages across the edge of a random walker running on the graph ( random - walk betweenness ) .",
    "a random walker moving from a vertex follows each adjacent edge with equal probability .",
    "a pair of vertices is chosen at random , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "the walker starts at @xmath155 and keeps moving until it hits @xmath156 , where it stops .",
    "one computes the probability that each edge was crossed by the walker , and averages over all possible choices for the vertices @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "it is meaningful to compute the _",
    "net _ crossing probability , which is proportional to the number of times the walk crossed the edge in one direction . in this way one neglects back and forth passages that are accidents of the random walk and tell nothing about the centrality of the edge .",
    "calculation of random - walk betweenness requires the inversion of an @xmath167 matrix ( once ) , followed by obtaining and averaging the flows for all pairs of nodes .",
    "the first task requires a time @xmath154 , the second @xmath206 , for a total complexity @xmath207 $ ] , or @xmath154 for a sparse matrix .",
    "the complete calculation requires a time @xmath154 on a sparse graph .",
    "current - flow betweenness is defined by considering the graph a resistor network , with edges having unit resistance .",
    "if a voltage difference is applied between any two vertices , each edge carries some amount of current , that can be calculated by solving kirchoff s equations .",
    "the procedure is repeated for all possible vertex pairs : the current - flow betweenness of an edge is the average value of the current carried by the edge .",
    "it is possible to show that this measure is equivalent to random - walk betweenness , as the voltage differences and the random walks net flows across the edges satisfy the same equations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the calculation of current - flow betweenness has the same complexity @xmath207 $ ] , or @xmath154 for a sparse graph .",
    "calculating edge betweenness is much faster than current - flow or random walk betweenness [ @xmath129 versus @xmath154 on sparse graphs ] .",
    "in addition , in practical applications the girvan - newman algorithm with edge betweenness gives better results than adopting the other centrality measures  @xcite .",
    "numerical studies show that the recalculation step 3 of girvan - newman algorithm is essential to detect meaningful communities .",
    "this introduces an additional factor @xmath14 in the running time of the algorithm : consequently , the edge betweenness version scales as @xmath208 , or @xmath154 on a sparse graph . on graphs with strong community structure , that quickly break into communities , the recalculation step needs to be performed only within the connected component including the last removed edge ( or the two components bridged by it if the removal of the edge splits a subgraph ) , as the edge betweenness of all other edges remains the same .",
    "this can help saving some computer time , although it is impossible to give estimates of the gain since it depends on the specific graph at hand .",
    "nevertheless , the algorithm is quite slow , and applicable to sparse graphs with up to @xmath209 vertices , with current computational resources . in the original version of girvan - newman s algorithm  @xcite , the authors had to deal with the whole hierarchy of partitions , as they had no procedure to say which partition is the best . in a successive refinement  @xcite , they selected the partition with the largest value of modularity ( see section  [ sec3_2_2 ] ) , a criterion that has been frequently used ever since .",
    "the method can be simply extended to the case of weighted graphs , by suitably generalizing the edge betweenness .",
    "the betweenness of a weighted edge equals the betweenness of the edge in the corresponding unweighted graph , divided by the weight of the edge  @xcite .",
    "there have been countless applications of the girvan - newman method : the algorithm is now integrated in well known libraries of network analysis programs .",
    "tyler et al . proposed a modification of the girvan - newman algorithm , to improve the speed of the calculation  @xcite . the gain in speed",
    "was required by the analysis of graphs of gene co - occurrences , which are too large to be analyzed by the algorithm of girvan and newman .",
    "algorithms computing site / edge betweenness start from any vertex , taken as center , and compute the contribution to betweenness from all paths originating at that vertex ; the procedure is then repeated for all vertices  @xcite .",
    "tyler et al .",
    "proposed to calculate the contribution to edge betweenness only from a limited number of centers , chosen at random , deriving a sort of monte carlo estimate .",
    "numerical tests indicate that , for each connected subgraph , it suffices to pick a number of centers growing as the logarithm of the number of vertices of the component . for a given choice of the centers ,",
    "the algorithm proceeds just like that of girvan and newman .",
    "the stopping criterion is different , though , as it does not require the calculation of modularity on the resulting partitions , but relies on a particular definition of community .",
    "according to such definition , a connected subgraph with @xmath210 vertices is a community if the edge betweenness of any of its edges does not exceed @xmath211 . indeed ,",
    "if the subgraph consists of two parts connected by a single edge , the betweenness value of that edge would be greater than or equal to @xmath211 , with the equality holding only if one of the two parts consists of a single vertex .",
    "therefore , the condition on the betweenness of the edges would exclude such situations , although other types of cluster structures might still be compatible with it . in this way , in the method of tyler et al .",
    ", edges are removed until all connected components of the partition are `` communities '' in the sense explained above .",
    "the monte carlo sampling of the edge betweenness necessarily induces statistical errors . as a consequence ,",
    "the partitions are in general different for different choices of the set of center vertices .",
    "however , the authors showed that , by repeating the calculation many times , the method gives good results on a network of gene co - occurrences  @xcite , with a substantial gain of computer time .",
    "the technique has been also applied to a network of people corresponding via email  @xcite . in practical examples ,",
    "only vertices lying at the boundary between communities may not be clearly classified , and be assigned sometimes to a group , sometimes to another .",
    "this is actually a nice feature of the method , as it allows to identify overlaps between communities , as well as the degree of membership of overlapping vertices in the clusters they belong to .",
    "the algorithm of girvan and newman , which is deterministic , is unable to accomplish this .",
    "another fast version of the girvan - newman algorithm has been proposed by rattigan et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", a quick approximation of the edge betweenness values is carried out by using a _ network structure index _ , which consists of a set of vertex annotations combined with a distance measure  @xcite .",
    "basically one divides the graph into regions and computes the distances of every vertex from each region . in this way",
    "rattigan et al . showed that it is possible to lower the complexity of the algorithm to @xmath21 , by keeping a fair accuracy in the estimate of the edge betweenness values .",
    "this version of the girvan - newman algorithm gives good results on the benchmark graphs proposed by brandes et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also section  [ sec6_1 ] ) , as well as on a collaboration network of actors and on a citation network .",
    "chen and yuan have pointed out that counting all possible shortest paths in the calculation of the edge betweenness may lead to unbalanced partitions , with communities of very different size , and proposed to count only _ non - redundant _ paths , i.  e. paths whose endpoints are all different from each other : the resulting betweenness yields better results than standard edge betweenness for mixed clusters on the benchmark graphs of girvan and newman  @xcite .",
    "holme et al .",
    "have used a modified version of the algorithm in which vertices , rather than edges , are removed  @xcite . a centrality measure for the vertices , proportional to their site betweenness , and inversely proportional to their indegree , is chosen to identify boundary vertices , which are then iteratively removed with all their edges .",
    "this modification , applied to study the hierarchical organization of biochemical networks , is motivated by the need to account for reaction kinetic information , that simple site betweenness does not include .",
    "the indegree of a vertex is solely used because it indicates the number of substrates to a metabolic reaction involving that vertex ; for the purpose of clustering the graph is considered undirected , as usual .",
    "the algorithm of girvan and newman is unable to find overlapping communities , as each vertex is assigned to a single cluster .",
    "pinney and westhead have proposed a modification of the algorithm in which vertices can be split between communities  @xcite .",
    "to do that , they also compute the betweenness of all vertices of the graph .",
    "unfortunately the values of edge and site betweenness can not be simply compared , due to their different normalization , but the authors remarked that the two endvertices of an inter - cluster edge should have similar betweenness values , as the shortest paths crossing one of them are likely to reach the other one as well through the edge .",
    "so they take the edge with largest betweenness and remove it only if the ratio of the betweenness values of its endvertices is between @xmath18 and @xmath212 , with @xmath213 .",
    "otherwise , the vertex with highest betweenness ( with all its adjacent edges ) is temporarily removed .",
    "when a subgraph is split by vertex or edge removal , all deleted vertices belonging to that subgraph are `` copied '' in each subcomponent , along with all their edges .",
    "gregory  @xcite has proposed a similar approach , named conga ( cluster overlap newman - girvan algorithm ) , in which vertices are split among clusters if their site betweenness exceeds the maximum value of the betweenness of the edges .",
    "a vertex is split by assigning some of its edges to one of its duplicates , and the rest to the other .",
    "there are several possibilities to do that , gregory proposed to go for the split that yields the maximum of a new centrality measure , called _ split betweenness _ , which is the number of shortest paths that would run between two parts of a vertex if the latter were split .",
    "the method has a worst - case complexity @xmath214 , or @xmath154 on a sparse graph , like the algorithm of girvan and newman .",

    "another promising track to detect inter - cluster edges is related to the presence of cycles , i.  e. closed non - intersecting paths , in the graph .",
    "communities are characterized by a high density of edges , so it is reasonable to expect that such edges form cycles . on the contrary",
    ", edges lying between communities will hardly be part of cycles .",

    "proposed a new measure , the edge clustering coefficient , such that low values of the measure are likely to correspond to intercommunity edges  @xcite .",

    "[ edgeclus ] ) .     schematic illustration of the edge clustering coefficient introduced by radicchi et al .",
    "the two grey vertices have five and six other neighbors , respectively . of the five possible triangles based on the edge connecting the grey vertices ,",
    "three are actually there , yielding an edge clustering coefficient @xmath216 .",
    "courtesy by f. radicchi . ]",
    "the clustering coefficient of a vertex is the number of triangles including the vertex divided by the number of possible triangles that can be formed ( section  [ sec1_1 ] ) .",
    "the edge clustering coefficient is defined as @xmath217 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the extremes of the edge , @xmath218 the number of cycles of length @xmath126 built upon edge @xmath219 and @xmath220 the possible number of cycles of length @xmath126 that one could build based on the existing edges of @xmath67 , @xmath68 and their neighbors .",
    "the number of actual cycles in the numerator is augmented by @xmath2 to enable a ranking among edges without cycles , which would all yield a coefficient @xmath221 equal to zero , independently of the degrees of the extremes @xmath67 and @xmath68 and their neighbors .",
    "usually , cycles of length @xmath222 ( triangles ) or @xmath223 are considered .",
    "the measure is ( anti)correlated with edge betweenness : edges with low edge clustering coefficient usually have high betweenness and vice versa , although the correlation is not perfect .",
    "the method works as the algorithm by girvan and newman . at each iteration ,",
    "the edge with smallest clustering coefficient is removed , the measure is recalculated again , and so on . if the removal of an edge leads to a split of a subgraph in two parts , the split is accepted only if both clusters are ls - sets ( `` strong '' ) or `` weak '' communities ( see section  [ sec3_1_2 ] ) .",
    "the verification of the community condition on the clusters is performed on the full adjacency matrix of the initial graph .",
    "if the condition were satisfied only for one of the two clusters , the initial subgraph may be a random graph , as it can be easily seen that by cutting a random graph  la erds and rnyi in two parts , the larger of them is a strong ( or weak ) community with very high probability , whereas the smaller part is not . enforcing the community condition on both clusters , it is more likely that the subgraph to be split indeed has a cluster structure .",
    "therefore , the algorithm stops when all clusters produced by the edge removals are communities in the strong or weak sense , and further splits would violate this condition .",
    "the authors suggested to use the same stopping criterion for the algorithm of girvan and newman , to get structurally well - defined clusters .",
    "since the edge clustering coefficient is a local measure , involving at most an extended neighborhood of the edge , it can be calculated very quickly .",
    "the running time of the algorithm to completion is @xmath224 , or @xmath129 on a sparse graph , if @xmath126 is small , so it is much shorter than the running time of the girvan - newman method .",
    "the recalculation step becomes slow if @xmath126 is not so small , as in this case the number of edges whose coefficient needs to be recalculated may reach a sizeable fraction of the edges of the graph ; likewise , counting the number of cycles based on one edge becomes lengthier . if @xmath225 , where @xmath88 is the diameter of the graph ( which is usually a small number for real networks ) , the cycles span the whole graph and the measure becomes global and no more local .",
    "the computational complexity in this case exceeds that of the algorithm of girvan and newman , but it can come close to it for practical purposes even at lower values of @xmath126 .",
    "so , by tuning @xmath126 one can smoothly interpolate between a local and a global centrality measure .",
    "the software of the algorithm can be found in http://filrad.homelinux.org / data/. in a successive paper  @xcite the authors extended the method to the case of weighted networks , by modifying the edge clustering coefficient of eq .",
    "[ eq3010 ] , in that the number of cycles @xmath218 is multiplied by the weight of the edge @xmath219 .",
    "the definitions of strong and weak communities can be trivially extended to weighted graphs by replacing the internal / external degrees of the vertices / clusters with the corresponding strengths .",
    "more recently , the method has been extended to bipartite networks  @xcite , where only cycles of even length are possible ( @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , etc . ) .",
    "the algorithm by radicchi et al . may give poor results when the graph has few cycles , as it happens in some social and many non - social networks .",
    "in this case , in fact , the edge clustering coefficient is small and fairly similar for most edges , and the algorithm may fail to identify the bridges between communities .    an alternative measure of centrality for edges is information centrality .",
    "it is based on the concept of efficiency  @xcite , which estimates how easily information travels on a graph according to the length of shortest paths between vertices .",
    "the efficiency of a network is defined as the average of the inverse distances between all pairs of vertices .",
    "if the vertices are `` close '' to each other , the efficiency is high .",
    "the information centrality of an edge is the relative variation of the efficiency of the graph if the edge is removed . in the algorithm by fortunato et al .",
    "@xcite , edges are removed according to decreasing values of information centrality .",
    "the method is analogous to that of girvan and newman .",
    "computing the information centrality of an edge requires the calculation of the distances between all pairs of vertices , which can be done with breadth - first - search in a time @xmath205 .",

    "removes the edge with the largest value of information centrality and recalculates the information centrality of all remaining edges with respect to the running graph .",

    "the partition with the largest value of modularity is chosen as most representative of the community structure of the graph .",
    "the method is much slower than the algorithm of girvan and newman .",
    "partitions obtained with both techniques are rather consistent , mainly because information centrality has a strong correlation with edge betweenness .",
    "the algorithm by fortunato et al . gives better results when communities are mixed , i.  e. with a high degree of interconnectedness , but it tends to isolate leaf vertices and small loosely bound subgraphs .",

    "an exhaustive optimization of @xmath90 is impossible , due to the huge number of ways in which it is possible to partition a graph , even when the latter is small . besides , the true maximum is out of reach , as it has been recently proved that modularity optimization is an np - complete problem  @xcite , so it is probably impossible to find the solution in a time growing polynomially with the size of the graph .",
    "however , there are currently several algorithms able to find fairly good approximations of the modularity maximum in a reasonable time .",
    "the first algorithm devised to maximize modularity was a greedy method of newman  @xcite .",

    "one starts from @xmath15 clusters , each containing a single vertex .",
    "edges are not initially present , they are added one by one during the procedure .",

    "reduces the number of groups from @xmath15 to @xmath143 , so it delivers a new partition of the graph .",
    "the edge is chosen such that this partition gives the maximum increase ( minimum decrease ) of modularity with respect to the previous configuration .",
    "all other edges are added based on the same principle .",
    "if the insertion of an edge does not change the partition , i.  e. the edge is internal to one of the clusters previously formed , modularity stays the same .",
    "the number of partitions found during the procedure is @xmath15 , each with a different number of clusters , from @xmath15 to @xmath2 .",
    "the largest value of modularity in this subset of partitions is the approximation of the modularity maximum given by the algorithm . at each iteration step",

    "since the calculation of each @xmath235 can be done in constant time , this part of the calculation requires a time @xmath21 . after deciding which communities are to be merged ,",

    "since the algorithm requires @xmath143 iterations ( community mergers ) to run to completion , its complexity is @xmath237 , or @xmath129 on a sparse graph , so it enables one to perform a clustering analysis on much larger networks than the algorithm of girvan and newman ( up to an order of @xmath238 vertices with current computers ) . in a later paper",
    "@xcite , clauset et al . pointed out that the update of the matrix @xmath236 in newman s algorithm involves a large number of useless operations , due to the sparsity of the adjacency matrix .",

    "to improve the situation they proposed a modification in which , at each step , one seeks the community merger delivering the largest value of the product of the modularity variation @xmath235 times a factor ( _ consolidation ratio _ ) , that peaks for communities of equal size . in this way",
    "there is a tradeoff between the gain in modularity and the balance of the communities to merge , with a big gain in the speed of the procedure , that enables the analysis of systems with up to @xmath245 vertices .",

    "this generates several `` centers '' around which communities are formed , which grow simultaneously so that a condensation into a few large clusters is unlikely .",
    "this modified version of the greedy algorithm is combined with a simple refinement procedure in which single vertices are moved to the neighboring community that yields the maximum increase of modularity .",

    "@xcite : here the initial partition is such that no single vertex can be moved from its cluster to another without decreasing @xmath90 .",
    "higher - quality modularities can be also achieved by applying refinement strategies based on local search at various steps of the greedy agglomeration  @xcite .",
    "such refinement procedures are similar to the technique proposed by newman to improve the results of his spectral optimization of modularity ( @xcite and section  [ sub_sec6_0_4 ] ) .",
    "another good strategy consists in alternating greedy optimization with stochastic perturbations of the partitions  @xcite .",
    "a different greedy approach has been introduced by blondel et al .",
    "@xcite , for the general case of weighted graphs .",
    "initially , all vertices of the graph are put in different communities .",
    "the first step consists of a sequential sweep over all vertices .",
    "given a vertex @xmath67 , one computes the gain in weighted modularity ( eq .  [ eq : mod2 ] ) coming from putting @xmath67 in the community of its neighbor @xmath68 and picks the community of the neighbor that yields the largest increase of @xmath90 , as long as it is positive . at the end of the sweep ,",
    "one obtains the first level partition . in the second step communities",
    "are replaced by supervertices , and two supervertices are connected if there is at least an edge between vertices of the corresponding communities . in this case , the weight of the edge between the supervertices is the sum of the weights of the edges between the represented communities at the lower level .",
    "the two steps of the algorithm are then repeated , yielding new hierarchical levels and supergraphs ( fig .",
    "[ blondelmethod ] ) .",
    "we remark that modularity is always computed from the initial graph topology : operating on supergraphs enables one to consider the variations of modularity for partitions of the original graph after merging and/or splitting of groups of vertices .",
    "therefore , at some iteration , modularity can not increase anymore , and the algorithm stops . the technique is more limited by storage demands than by computational time .",
    "the latter grows like @xmath21 , so the algorithm is extremely fast and graphs with up to @xmath246 edges can be analyzed in a reasonable time on current computational resources .",
    "the software can be found at http://findcommunities.googlepages.com/. the modularity maxima found by the method are better than those found with the greedy techniques by clauset et al .",
    "@xcite and wakita and tsurumi  @xcite .",
    "however , closing communities within the immediate neighborhood of vertices may be inaccurate and yield spurious partitions in practical cases .",
    "so , it is not clear whether some of the intermediate partitions could correspond to meaningful hierarchical levels of the graph .",
    "moreover , the results of the algorithm depend on the order of the sequential sweep over the vertices .",
    "we conclude by stressing that , despite the improvements and refinements of the last years , the accuracy of greedy optimization is not that good , as compared with other techniques .",
    "simulated annealing  @xcite is a probabilistic procedure for global optimization used in different fields and problems .",
    "it consists in performing an exploration of the space of possible states , looking for the global optimum of a function @xmath247 , say its maximum .",
    "transitions from one state to another occur with probability @xmath2 if @xmath247 increases after the change , otherwise with a probability @xmath248 , where @xmath249 is the decrease of the function and @xmath19 is an index of stochastic noise , a sort of inverse temperature , which increases after each iteration .",
    "the noise reduces the risk that the system gets trapped in local optima . at some stage",
    ", the system converges to a stable state , which can be an arbitrarily good approximation of the maximum of @xmath247 , depending on how many states were explored and how slowly @xmath19 is varied .",
    "simulated annealing was first employed for modularity optimization by guimer et al .",
    "its standard implementation  @xcite combines two types of `` moves '' : local moves , where a single vertex is shifted from one cluster to another , taken at random ; global moves , consisting of mergers and splits of communities .",
    "splits can be carried out in several distinct ways .",
    "the best performance is achieved if one optimizes the modularity of a bipartition of the cluster , taken as an isolated graph .",
    "this is done again with simulated annealing , where one considers only individual vertex movements , and the temperature is decreased until it reaches the running value for the global optimization .",
    "global moves reduce the risk of getting trapped in local minima and they have proven to lead to much better optima than using simply local moves  @xcite . in practical applications ,",

    "a fitness measure for each vertex is obtained by dividing the local modularity of the vertex by its degree , as in this case the measure does not depend on the degree of the vertex and is suitably normalized .",
    "one starts from a random partition of the graph in two groups with the same number of vertices . at each iteration ,",
    "the vertex with the lowest fitness is shifted to the other cluster .",
    "the move changes the partition , so the local fitnesses of many vertices need to be recalculated .",
    "the process continues until the global modularity @xmath90 can not be improved any more by the procedure .",
    "this technique reminds one of the kernighan - lin  @xcite algorithm for graph partitioning ( section  [ sec4_1 ] ) , but here the sizes of the communities are determined by the process itself , whereas in graph partitioning they are fixed from the beginning . after the bipartition ,",
    "each cluster is considered as a graph on its own and the procedure is repeated , as long as @xmath90 increases for the partitions found .",
    "the procedure , as described , proceeds deterministically from the given initial partition , as one shifts systematically the vertex with lowest fitness , and is likely to get trapped in local optima .",
    "better results can be obtained if one introduces a probabilistic selection , in which vertices are ranked based on their fitness values and one picks the vertex of rank @xmath91 with the probability @xmath252 ( @xmath253-eo , @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithm finds very good estimates of the modularity maximum , and performs very well on the benchmark of girvan and newman  @xcite ( section  [ sec6_1 ] ) .",
    "ranking the fitness values has a cost @xmath254 , which can be reduced to @xmath20 if heap data structures are used . choosing the vertex to be shifted",

    "because of that , barber assumes that the null model matrix @xmath398 , whose element @xmath100 indicates as usual the expected number of edges between vertices @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the null model , also has the block off - diagonal form @xmath399 where the @xmath400 are square matrices with all zero elements and @xmath401 , as in the null model of standard modularity ( though other choices are possible ) .",
    "the modularity maximum can be computed through the modularity matrix @xmath402 , as we have seen in section  [ sub_sec6_0_4 ] .",
    "however , spectral optimization of modularity gives excellent results for bipartitions , while its performance worsens when the number of clusters is unknown , as it is usually the case .",
    "barber has proposed a different optimization technique , called bipartite recursively induced modules ( brim ) , based on the bipartite nature of the graph . the algorithm is based on the special expression of modularity for the bipartite case , for which once the partition of the red or the blue vertices is known , it is easy to get the partition of the other vertex class that yields the maximum modularity .",
    "therefore , one starts from an arbitrary partition in @xmath117 clusters of , say , the blue vertices , and recovers the partition of the red vertices , which is in turn used as input to get a better partition of the blue vertices , and so on until modularity converges .",
    "brim does not predict the number of clusters @xmath117 of the graph , but one can obtain good estimates for it by exploring different values with a simple bisection approach .",
    "typically , for a given @xmath117 the algorithm needs a few steps to converge , each step having a complexity @xmath21 .",
    "an expression of the number of convergence steps in terms of @xmath15 and/or @xmath14 still needs to be derived .      in this section",
    "we shall discuss some features of modularity , which are crucial to identify the domain of its applicability and ultimately to assess the issue of the reliability of the measure for the problem of graph clustering .",
    "an important question concerns the value of the maximum modularity @xmath403 for a graph . we know that it must be non - negative , as there is always at least a partition with zero modularity , consisting in a single cluster with all vertices ( section  [ sec3_2_2 ] ) .",
    "however , a large value for the modularity maximum does not necessarily mean that a graph has community structure .",
    "random graphs are supposed to have no community structure , as the linking probability between vertices is either constant or a function of the vertex degrees , so there is no bias _ a priori _ towards special groups of vertices . still , random graphs may have partitions with large modularity values  @xcite .",
    "this is due to fluctuations in the distribution of edges in the graph , which in many graph realizations is not homogeneous even if the linking probability is constant , like in erds - rnyi graphs .",
    "the fluctuations determine concentrations of links in some subsets of the graph , which then appear like communities . according to the definition of modularity",
    ", a graph has community structure with respect to a random graph with equal size and expected degree sequence .",
    "therefore , the modularity maximum of a graph reveals a significant community structure only if it is appreciably larger than the modularity maximum of random graphs of the same size and expected degree sequence .",
    "the significance of the modularity maximum @xmath403 for a graph can be estimated by calculating the maximum modularity for many realizations of the null model , obtained from the original graph by randomly rewiring its edges .",
    "one then computes the average @xmath404 and the standard deviation @xmath405 of the results .",
    "the statistical significance of @xmath403 is indicated by the distance of @xmath403 from the null model average @xmath404 in units of the standard deviation @xmath405 , i.  e. by the @xmath406-score @xmath407 if @xmath408 , @xmath403 indicates strong community structure .",
    "cutoff values of @xmath409 for the @xmath406-scores are customary .",
    "this approach has problems , though .",
    "it can generate both false positives and false negatives : a few graphs that most people would consider without a significant community structure have a large @xmath406-score ; on the other hand , some graphs that are agreed to display cluster structure have very low values for the @xmath406-score . besides , the distribution of the maximum modularity values of the null model , though peaked , is not gaussian .",
    "therefore , one can not attribute to the values of the @xmath406-score the significance corresponding to a gaussian distribution , and one would need instead to compute the statistical significance for the right distribution .    reichardt and bornholdt have studied the issue of the modularity values for random graphs in some depth  @xcite , using their general spin glass formulation of the clustering problem ( section  [ sub_sec6_01 ] ) .",
    "they considered the general case of a random graph with arbitrary degree distribution @xmath410 and without degree - degree correlations .",
    "they set @xmath368 , so that the energy of the ground state coincides with modularity ( up to a constant factor ) . for modularity s",
    "null model graphs , the modularity maximum corresponds to an equipartition of the graph , i.  e. the magnetization of the ground state of the spin glass is zero , a result confirmed by numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "this is because the distribution of the couplings has zero mean , and the mean is only coupled to magnetization  @xcite . for a partition of any graph with @xmath15 vertices and @xmath14 edges in @xmath91 clusters with equal numbers of vertices , there is a simple linear relation between the cut size @xmath411 of the partition and its modularity @xmath412 : @xmath413 $ ] .",
    "we remind that the cut size @xmath411 is the total number of inter - cluster edges of the partition ( section  [ sec4_1 ] ) . in this way , the partition with maximum modularity is also the one with minimum cut size , and community detection becomes equivalent to graph partitioning .",
    "reichardt and bornholdt derived analytically the ground state energy for ising spins ( @xmath414 ) , which corresponds to the following expression of the expected maximum modularity @xmath415 for a bipartition  @xcite @xmath416 here @xmath417 and @xmath418 is the ground state energy of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model  @xcite .",
    "the most interesting feature of eq .",
    "[ eqr19 ] is the simple scaling with @xmath419 .",
    "numerical calculations show that this scaling holds for both erds - rnyi and scale - free graphs ( section  [ sec1_3 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the result is valid for partitions in @xmath91 clusters , where @xmath91 is left free , not only for @xmath414 .",
    "the number of clusters of the partition with maximum modularity decreases if the average degree @xmath420 increases , and tends to @xmath421 for large values of @xmath420 , regardless of the degree distribution and the size of the graph . from eq .",
    "[ eqr19 ] we also see that the expected maximum modularity for a random graph increases when @xmath420 decreases , i. e. if the graph gets sparser .",
    "so it is particularly hard to detect communities in sparse graphs by using modularity optimization .",
    "as we shall see in section  [ sec6_4 ] , the sparsity of a graph is generally a serious obstacle for graph clustering methods , no matter if one uses modularity or not .    a more fundamental issue , raised by fortunato and barthlemy  @xcite , concerns the capability of modularity to detect `` good '' partitions .",
    "if a graph has a clear cluster structure , one expects that the maximum modularity of the graph reveals it .",
    "the null model of modularity assumes that any vertex @xmath67 `` sees '' any other vertex @xmath68 , and the expected number of edges between them is @xmath369 .",
    "similarly , the expected number of edges between two clusters @xmath258 and @xmath259 with total degrees @xmath422 and @xmath423 , respectively , is @xmath424 .",
    "the variation of modularity determined by the merger of @xmath258 and @xmath259 with respect to the partition in which they are separate clusters is @xmath425 , with @xmath426 number of edges connecting @xmath258 to @xmath259 .",
    "if @xmath427 , i.  e. there is a single edge joining @xmath258 to @xmath259 , we expect that the two subgraphs will often be kept separated . instead , if @xmath428 , @xmath429 .",
    "let us suppose for simplicity that @xmath430 , i.  e. that the two subgraphs are of about the same size , measured in terms of edges .",
    "we conclude that , if @xmath431 and the two subgraphs @xmath258 and @xmath259 are connected , modularity is greater if they are in the same cluster  @xcite .",
    "the reason is intuitive : if there are more edges than expected between @xmath258 and @xmath259 , there is a strong topological correlation between the subgraphs .",
    "if the subgraphs are sufficiently small ( in degree ) , the expected number of edges for the null model can be smaller than one , so even the weakest possible connection ( a single edge ) suffices to keep the subgraphs together .",
    "interestingly , this result holds independently of the structure of the subgraphs .",
    "in particular it remains true if the subgraphs are cliques , which are the subgraphs with the largest possible density of internal edges , and represent the strongest possible communities .",
    "resolution limit of modularity optimization .",
    "the natural community structure of the graph , represented by the individual cliques ( circles ) , is not recognized by optimizing modularity , if the cliques are smaller than a scale depending on the size of the graph . in this case",
    ", the maximum modularity corresponds to a partition whose clusters include two or more cliques ( like the groups indicated by the dashed contours ) . reprinted figure with permission from ref .",

    "[ figure7 ] a graph is made out of @xmath115 identical cliques , with @xmath76 vertices each , connected by single edges .",
    "it is intuitive to think that the clusters of the best partition are the individual cliques : instead , if @xmath115 is larger than about @xmath432 , modularity would be higher for partitions in which the clusters are groups of cliques ( like the clique pairs indicated by the dashed lines in the figure ) .",
    "the conclusion is striking : modularity optimization has a resolution limit that may prevent it from detecting clusters which are comparatively small with respect to the graph as a whole , even when they are well defined communities like cliques .",
    "so , if the partition with maximum modularity includes clusters with total degree of the order of @xmath433 or smaller , one can not know _ a priori _ whether the clusters are single communities or combinations of smaller weakly interconnected communities .",
    "this resolution problem has a large impact in practical applications .",
    "real graphs with community structure usually contain communities which are very diverse in size  @xcite , so many ( small ) communities may remain undetected .",
    "besides , modularity is extremely sensitive to even individual connections .",
    "many real graphs , in biology and in the social sciences , are reconstructed through experiments and surveys , so edges may occasionally be false positives : if two small subgraphs happen to be connected by a few false edges , modularity will put them in the same cluster , inferring a relationship between entities that in reality may have nothing to do with each other .",
    "the resolution limit comes from the very definition of modularity , in particular from its null model .",
    "the weak point of the null model is the implicit assumption that each vertex can interact with every other vertex , which implies that each part of the graph knows about everything else .",
    "this is however questionable , and certainly wrong for large systems like , e.g. , the web graph .",
    "it is certainly more reasonable to assume that each vertex has a limited horizon within the graph , and interacts just with a portion of it .",
    "however , nobody knows yet how to define such local territories for the graph vertices .",
    "the null model of the localized modularity of muff et al .",
    "( section  [ sub_sec6_01 ] ) is a possibility , since it limits the horizon of a vertex to a local neighborhood , comprising the cluster of the vertex and the clusters linked to it by at least one edge ( neighboring clusters ) .",
    "however , there are many other possible choices . in this respect , the null model of girvan and newman ,",
    "though unrealistic , is the simplest one can think of , which partly explains its success .",
    "quality functions that , like modularity , are based on a null model such that the horizon of vertices is of the order of the size of the whole graph , are likely to be affected by a resolution limit  @xcite .",
    "the problem is more general , though .",
    "for instance , li et al .",
    "@xcite have introduced a quality function , called _ modularity density _ , which consists in the sum over the clusters of the ratio between the difference of the internal and external degrees of the cluster and the cluster size .",
    "the modularity density does not require a null model , and delivers better results than modularity optimization ( e. g. it correctly recovers the natural partition of the graph in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] for any number / size of the cliques ) . however , it is still affected by a resolution limit . to avoid that , li et al .",
    "proposed a more general definition of their measure , including a tunable parameter that allows to explore the graph at different resolutions , in the spirit of the methods of section  [ sub_sec6_20 ] .",
    "a way to go around the resolution limit problem could be to perform further subdivisions of the clusters obtained from modularity optimization , in order to eliminate possible artificial mergers of communities .",
    "for instance , one could recursively optimize modularity for each single cluster , taking the cluster as a separate entity  @xcite . however , this is not a reliable procedure , for two reasons : 1 ) the local modularities used to find partitions within the clusters have different null models , as they depend on the cluster sizes , so they are inconsistent with each other ; 2 ) one needs to define a criterion to decide when one has to stop partitioning a cluster , but there is no obvious prescription , so any choice is necessarily based on arbitrary assumptions - score is sufficiently high , the subgraph is supposed to have community structure and one accepts the partition in smaller pieces .",
    "the procedure stops when none of the subgraphs of the running partitions has significant community structure , based on modularity . ] .",
    "resolution limits arise as well in the more general formulation of community detection by reichardt and bornholt  @xcite . here",
    "the limit scale for the undetectable clusters is @xmath434 .",
    "we remind that @xmath371 weighs the contribution of the null model term in the quality function . for @xmath368",
    "one recovers the resolution limit of modularity . by tuning the parameter @xmath371 it is possible to arbitrarily vary the resolution scale of the corresponding quality function",
    "this in principle solves the problem of the resolution limit , as one could adjust the resolution of the method to the actual scale of the communities to detect .",
    "the problem is that usually one has no information about the community sizes , so it is not possible to decide _ a priori _ the proper value(s ) of @xmath371 for a specific graph . in the most recent literature on graph clustering quite a few _ multiresolution methods _ have been introduced , addressing this problem in several ways .",
    "we will discuss them in some detail in section  [ sub_sec6_20 ] .",
    "the resolution limit can be easily extended to the case of weighted graphs . in a recent paper  @xcite , berry et al .",

    "next , the elements of each column must be divided by their sum , such that the sum of the elements of the column equals one and a new transfer matrix is recovered . after some iterations , the process delivers a stable matrix , with some remarkable properties .",
    "its elements are either zero or one , so it is a sort of adjacency matrix .",
    "most importantly , the graph described by the matrix is disconnected , and its connected components are the communities of the original graph .",
    "the method is really simple to implement , which is the main reason of its success : as of now , the mcl is one of the most used clustering algorithms in bioinformatics .",
    "the code can be downloaded from http://www.micans.org / mcl/. due to the matrix multiplication of the expansion step , the algorithm should scale as @xmath154 , even if the graph is sparse , as the running matrix becomes quickly dense after a few steps of the algorithm .",
    "however , while computing the matrix multiplication , mcl keeps only a maximum number @xmath44 of non - zero elements per column , where @xmath44 is usually much smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "so , the actual worst - case running time of the algorithm is @xmath493 on a sparse graph .",
    "a problem of the method is the fact that the final partition is sensitive to the parameter @xmath18 used in the inflation step .",

    "the units of the system are in the same or similar state(s ) at every time .",
    "synchronization has also been applied to find communities in graphs . if oscillators are placed at the vertices , with initial random phases , and have nearest - neighbour interactions , oscillators in the same community synchronize first , whereas a full synchronization requires a longer time .",

    "the idea of closing a community by expanding a shell has been previously introduced by costa  @xcite , in which shells are centered on hubs .",

    "a unit potential difference is set between two randomly chosen vertices .",
    "the idea is that , if there is a clear division in two communities of the graph , there will be a visible gap between voltage values for vertices at the borders between the clusters .",
    "the voltages are calculated by solving kirchoff s equations : an exact solution would be too time consuming , but it is possible to find a reasonably good approximation in a linear time for a sparse graph with a clear community structure , so the more time consuming part of the algorithm is the sorting of the voltage values , which takes time @xmath254 .",
    "any possible vertex pair can be chosen to set the initial potential difference , so the procedure should be repeated for all possible vertex pairs .",

    "an interesting feature of the method is that it can quickly find the natural community of any vertex , without determining the complete partition of the graph .",

    "the initial decomposition of the graph is carried out through the multilevel method by dhillon et al .",

    "an interesting aspect of @xmath44-clique communities is that they allow to make a clear distinction between random graphs and graphs with community structure .",

    "the modularity of newman and girvan is based on the same null model ( section  [ sec3_2_2 ] ) .",
    "the null models of real graphs seem to display the same two scenarios found for erds - rnyi graphs , characterized by the presence of very small @xmath44-clique communities , with or without a giant cluster",

    "another big problem is that on real networks there is a considerable fraction of vertices that are left out of the communities , like leaves .",

    "the latter feature allows to identify _ change points _ in the time history of the system , i. e. short periods in which the dynamics produces big changes in the graph structure ( corresponding to , e.g. , extreme events ) .",
    "the minimization of @xmath706 is @xmath622-hard , so the authors propose an approximation method called _ graphscope _ , which consists of two steps : first , one looks for the best partition of each graph segment ; second , one looks for the best division in segments . in both cases the `` best '' result corresponds to the minimal encoding cost .",

    "the optimization of quality functions , like modularity , delivers the best partition according to the criterion underlying the quality function . but is the optimal clustering also _ significant _ , i.  e. a relevant feature of the graph , or is it just a byproduct of randomness and basic structural properties like , e. g. , the degree sequence ?",

    "for consistency , the natural choice is again the null model of modularity , which is already used in the process of graph perturbation .",
    "the approaches by gfeller et al . and karrer et al . , with suitable modifications , can also be used to check for the stability of the cluster structure in parts of a graph , up to the level of individual communities .",
    "this is potentially important as it may happen that some parts of the graph display a strong community structure and other parts weak or no community structure at all .",
    "rosvall and bergstrom  @xcite defined the significance of clusters with the bootstrap method  @xcite , which is a standard procedure to check for the accuracy of a measurement / estimate based on resampling from the empirical data .",
    "the graph at study is supposed to be generated by a parametric model , which is used to create many samples .",
    "this is done by assigning to each edge a weight taken by a poisson distribution with mean equal to the original edge weight . for the initial graph and each sample",
    "one identifies the community structure with some method , that can be arbitrary . for each cluster of the partition of the original graph one determines the largest subset of vertices that are classified in the same cluster in at least @xmath733 of all bootstrap samples .",
    "identifying such cluster cores enables one to track the evolution in time of the community structure , as we explained in section  [ sec7_1_2 ] .",
    "a different approach has been proposed by massen and doye  @xcite .",
    "they analyzed an equilibrium canonical ensemble of partitions , with @xmath734 playing the role of the energy , @xmath90 being newman - girvan modularity .",
    "this means that the probability of occurrence of a partition at temperature @xmath467 is proportional to @xmath735 .",
    "the idea is that , if a graph has a significant cluster structure , at low temperatures one would recover essentially the same partition , corresponding to the modularity maximum , which is separated by an appreciable gap from the modularity values of the other partitions . on the contrary , graphs with no community structure , e. g. random graphs , have many competing ( local ) maxima , and",
    "the corresponding configurations will emerge already at low temperatures , since their modularity values are close to the absolute maximum , good et al .",
    "@xcite have actually shown that the modularity landscape has a huge degeneracy of states with high modularity values , close to the global maximum , especially on graphs with community structure .",
    "so the results of the method by massen and doye may be misleading . ] .",
    "these distinct behaviors can manifest themselves in various ways .",
    "for instance , if one considers the variation of the specific heat @xmath736 with @xmath467 , the gap in the modularity landscape is associated to a sharp peak of @xmath706 around some temperature value , like it happens in a phase transition . if the gap is small and there are many partitions with similar modularity values , the peak of @xmath706 becomes broad .",
    "another strategy to assess the significance of the maximum modularity partition consists of the investigation of the similarity between partitions recovered at a given temperature @xmath467 .",
    "this similarity can be expressed by the _ frequency matrix _ , whose element @xmath737 indicates the relative number of times vertices @xmath67 and @xmath68 have been classified in the same cluster .",
    "if the graph has a clear community structure , at low temperatures the frequency matrix can be put in block - diagonal form , with the blocks corresponding to the communities of the best partition ; if there is no significant community structure , the frequency matrix is rather homogeneous .",
    "the fiedler eigenvalue  @xcite @xmath144 , the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix associated to the frequency matrix , allows to estimate how `` block - diagonal '' the matrix is ( see section  [ sec4_1 ] ) . at low temperatures @xmath738 if there is one ( a few ) partitions with maximum or near to maximum modularity ; if there are many ( almost ) degenerate partitions , @xmath144 is appreciably different from zero even when @xmath739 .",
    "a sharp transition from low to high values of @xmath144 by varying temperature indicates significant community structure .",
    "another clear signature of significant community structure is the observation of a rapid drop of the average community size with @xmath467 , as `` strong '' communities break up in many small pieces for a modest temperature increase , while the disintegration of `` weak '' communities takes place more slowly . in scale - free graphs",
    "( section  [ sec1_3 ] ) clusters are often not well separated , due to the presence of the hubs ; in these cases the above - mentioned transitions of ensemble variables are not so sharp and take place over a broader temperature range .",
    "the canonical ensemble of partitions is generated through single spin heatbath simulated annealing  @xcite , combined with parallel tempering  @xcite .",
    "the approach by massen and doye could be useful to recognize graphs without cluster structure , if the modularity landscape is characterized by many maxima with close values ( but see footnote ) .",
    "however , it can happen that gaps between the absolute modularity maximum and the rest of the modularity values are created by fluctuations , and the method is unable to identify these situations .",
    "furthermore , the approach heavily relies on modularity and on a costly technique like simulated annealing : extensions to other quality functions and/or optimization procedures do not appear straightforward .",
    "in a recent work by bianconi et al .  @xcite the notion of entropy of graph ensembles  @xcite is employed to find out how likely it is for a cluster structure to occur on a graph with a given degree sequence .",
    "the entropy is computed from the number of graph configurations which are compatible with a given classification of the vertices in @xmath91 groups .",

    "the absolute value of the entropy @xmath743 is not meaningful , so the comparison of @xmath743 and @xmath746 is crucial , as it tells how relevant the actual cluster structure is with respect to a random classification of the vertices .",
    "however , different permutations of the assignments @xmath745 yield different values of the entropy , which can fluctuate considerably",
    ". therefore one has to compute the standard deviation @xmath748 of the entropy corresponding to all random permutations @xmath747 , to estimate how significant the difference between @xmath743 and @xmath746 is . in this way , if @xmath749 , the entropy of the given cluster structure is of the same order as the entropy of some random permutation of the cluster labels , so it is not relevant . instead , if @xmath750 , the cluster structure is far more likely than a random classification of the vertices , so the clustering is relevant .",
    "the indicator @xmath751 can be simply generalized to the case of directed and weighted graphs .",
    "lancichinetti et al .",
    "@xcite as well addressed the issue by comparing the cluster structure of the graph with that of a random graph with similar properties",
    ". an important novelty of this approach is the fact that it estimates the significance of single communities , not of partitions .",
    "in fact , not all communities are equally significant , in general , so it makes a lot of sense to check them individually .",
    "in particular , it may happen that real networks are not fully modular , due to their particular history or generating mechanisms , and that only portions of them display community structure .",
    "the main idea is to verify how likely it is that a community @xmath22 is a subgraph of a random graph with the same degree sequence of the original graph .",
    "this likelihood is called @xmath22-score , and is computed by examining the vertex @xmath752 of @xmath22 , with the lowest internal degree @xmath753 in @xmath22 ( the `` worst '' vertex ) .",

    "this probability is computed by using tools from extreme and order statistics  @xcite .",
    "a low value of the @xmath22-score ( @xmath754 ) is a strong indication that the group of vertices at study is a community and not the product of random fluctuations .",
    "in addition , the measure can be used to check whether a subgraph has an internal modular structure . for that , one removes the vertices of the subgraph one at a time , starting from the worst and proceeding in increasing order of the internal degree , and observes how the @xmath22-score varies at each vertex removal : sharp drops indicate the presence of dense subgraphs ( fig .  [ cscore ] ) .",
    "therefore , one could think of using the @xmath22-score as ingredient of new clustering techniques .",
    "as we have seen , the @xmath22-score is based on the behavior of the vertex with lowest internal degree of the subgraph .",
    "real networks are characterized by noise , which could strongly affect the structural relationships between vertices and clusters .",
    "for this reason , relying on the properties of a single vertex to evaluate the significance of a subgraph could be a problem for applications to real networks .",
    "lancichinetti et al .",
    "have shown that the @xmath22-score can be easily extended to consider the @xmath156 vertices with lowest internal degree , with @xmath755 ( @xmath259-score ) .",
    "the main limit of the @xmath22-score is the fact that its null model is the same as that of newman - girvan modularity . according to this null model",
    ", each vertex can in principle be connected to any other , no matter how large the system is .",
    "this is however not realistic , especially for large graphs , where it is much more reasonable to assume that each vertex has its own `` horizon '' , i.e. a subset of other vertices with which it can interact , which is usually much smaller than the whole system ( see section  [ sub_sec6_1 ] ) .",
    "how to define such `` horizons '' and , more in general , realistic null models is still an open problem .",
    "however , the @xmath22-score could be easily reformulated with any null model , so one could readily derive more reliable definitions .",
    "we conclude with a general issue which is related to the significance of community structure .",
    "the question is : given a cluster structure in a graph , can it be recovered _ a priori _ by an algorithm ? in a recent paper  @xcite , reichardt and leone studied under which conditions a special built - in cluster structure can be recovered .",
    "the clusters have equal size and a pair of vertices is connected with probability @xmath45 if they belong to the same cluster , with probability @xmath756 otherwise . in computer science",
    "this is known as the _ planted partitioning problem _",
    "the goal is to propose algorithms that recover the planted partition for any choice of @xmath45 and @xmath375 . for dense graphs ,",
    "i.  e. graphs whose average degree grows with the number @xmath15 of vertices , algorithms can be designed that find the solution with a probability which equals @xmath2 minus a term that vanishes in the limit of infinite graph size , regardless of the difference @xmath757 , which can then be chosen arbitrarily small .",
    "since many real networks are not dense graphs , as their average degree @xmath758 is usually much smaller than @xmath15 and does not depend on it , reichardt and leone investigated the problem in the case of fixed @xmath758 and infinite graph size .",
    "we indicate with @xmath91 the number of clusters and with @xmath511 the probability that a randomly selected edge of the graph lies within any of the @xmath91 clusters . in this way",
    ", if @xmath759 , the inter - cluster edge density matches the intra - cluster edge density ( i.  e. @xmath760 ) , and the planted partition would not correspond to a recoverable clustering , whereas for @xmath761 , there are no inter - cluster edges and the partition can be trivially recovered .",
    "the value of @xmath511 is in principle unknown , so one has to detect the cluster structure ignoring this information .",
    "reichardt and leone proposed to look for a minimum cut partition , i.  e. for the partition that minimizes the number of inter - cluster edges , as it is usually done in the graph partitioning problem ( discussed in section  [ sec4_1 ] ) . clearly , for @xmath761 the minimum cut partition trivially coincides with the planted partition , whereas for @xmath762 there should be some overlap , which is expected to vanish in the limit case @xmath759 .",
    "the minimum cut partition corresponds to the minimum of the following ferromagnetic potts model hamiltonian @xmath763 over the set of all spin configurations with zero magnetization . here",
    "the spin @xmath357 indicates the cluster vertex @xmath67 belongs to , and the coupling matrix @xmath363 is just the adjacency matrix of the graph .",
    "the constraint of zero magnetization ensures that the clusters have all the same size , as required by the planted partitioning problem . the energy of a spin configuration , expressed by eq .",
    "[ eq : mod12 ] , is the negative of the number of edges that lie within clusters : the minimum energy corresponds to the maximum number of intra - cluster edges , which is coupled to the minimum number of inter - cluster edges . the minimum energy can be computed with the cavity method , or belief propagation , at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the solution with respect to the planted partition is expressed by the fraction of vertices which are put in the same class in both partitions .",
    "the analysis yields a striking result : the planted clustering is accurately recovered for @xmath511 larger than a critical threshold @xmath764 .",
    "so , there is a range of values of @xmath511 , @xmath765 , in which the clustering is not recoverable , as the minimum cut partition is uncorrelated with it .",
    "the threshold @xmath766 depends on the degree distribution @xmath767 of the graph .",
    "when a clustering algorithm is designed , it is necessary to test its performance , and compare it with that of other methods . in the previous sections we have said very little about the performance of the algorithms , other than their computational complexity .",
    "indeed , the issue of testing algorithms has received very little attention in the literature on graph clustering .",
    "this is a serious limit of the field . because of that , it is still impossible to state which method ( or subset of methods ) is the most reliable in applications , and people rely blindly on some algorithms instead of others for reasons that have nothing to do with the actual performance of the algorithms , like .",
    "e.g. popularity ( of the method or of its inventor ) .",
    "this lack of control is also the main reason for the proliferation of graph clustering techniques in the last few years .",
    "virtually in any paper , where a new method is introduced , the part about testing consists in applying the method to a small set of simple benchmark graphs , whose cluster structure is fairly easy to recover . because of that , the freedom in the design of a clustering algorithm is basically infinite , whereas it is not clear what a new procedure is adding to the field , if anything .    in this section",
    "we discuss at length the issue of testing .",
    "first , we describe the fundamental ingredients of any testing procedure , i.  e. benchmark graphs with built - in community structure , that methods have to identify ( section  [ sec6_1 ] ) .",
    "we proceed by reviewing measures to compare graph partitions with each other ( section  [ sec6_2 ] ) . in section  [ sec6_3 ]",
    "we present the comparative evaluations of different methods that have been performed in the literature .",
    "testing an algorithm essentially means applying it to a specific problem whose solution is known and comparing such solution with that delivered by the algorithm . in the case of graph clustering , a problem with a well - defined solution is a graph with a clear community structure .",
    "this concept is not trivial , however .",
    "many clustering algorithms are based on similar intuitive notions of what a community is , but different implementations .",
    "so it is crucial that the scientific community agrees on a set of reliable benchmark graphs .",
    "this mostly applies to computer - generated graphs , where the built - in cluster structure can be arbitrarily designed . in the literature real networks",
    "are used as well , in those cases in which communities are well defined because of information about the system .",
    "we start our survey from computer - generated benchmarks .",
    "a special class of graphs has become quite popular in the last years .",
    "they are generated with the so - called _ planted @xmath293-partition model _",
    "the model partitions a graph with @xmath768 vertices in @xmath293 groups with @xmath126 vertices each .",
    "vertices of the same group are linked with a probability @xmath511 , whereas vertices of different groups are linked with a probability @xmath512 .",
    "each subgraph corresponding to a group is then a random graph  la erds - rnyi with connection probability @xmath769 ( section  [ sec1_3 ] ) .",
    "the average degree of a vertex is @xmath770 .",
    "if @xmath513 the intra - cluster edge density exceeds the inter - cluster edge density and the graph has a community structure .",
    "this idea is quite intuitive and we have encountered it in several occasions in the previous sections .",
    "girvan and newman considered a special case of the planted @xmath293-partition model  @xcite .",
    "they set @xmath771 , @xmath772 ( so the number of graph vertices is @xmath773 ) and fixed the average total degree @xmath420 to @xmath774 .",
    "this implies that @xmath775 , so the probabilities @xmath511 and @xmath512 are not independent parameters . in calculation",
    "it is common to use as parameters @xmath776 and @xmath777 , indicating the expected internal and external degree of a vertex , respectively .",
    "these particular graphs have by now gained the status of standard benchmarks  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ figure11 ] ) .        in the first applications of the graphs one assumed that communities are well defined when @xmath778 , corresponding to the situation in which the internal degree exceeds the external degree .",
    "however , the threshold @xmath779 implies @xmath780 and @xmath781 , so it is not the actual threshold of the model , where @xmath782 , corresponding to @xmath783 .",
    "so , one expects to be able to detect the planted partition up until @xmath783 .    testing a method against the girvan - newman benchmark consists in calculating the similarity between the partitions determined by the method and the natural partition of the graph in the four equal - sized groups .",
    "several measures of partitions similarity may be adopted ; we describe them in section  [ sec6_2 ] .",
    "one usually builds many graph realizations for a particular value of @xmath784 and computes the average similarity between the solutions of the method and the built - in solution . the procedure is then iterated for different values of @xmath784 .",
    "the results are usually represented in a plot , where the average similarity is drawn as a function of @xmath784 .",
    "most algorithms usually do a good job for small @xmath784 and start to fail when @xmath784 approaches @xmath228 .",
    "fan et al .",
    "@xcite have designed a weighted version of the benchmark of girvan and newman , in that one gives different weights to edges inside and between communities .",
    "one could pick just two values , one for intra- and the other for inter - community edges , or uniformly distributed values in two different ranges . for this benchmark",
    "there are then two parameters that can be varied : @xmath784 and the relative importance of the internal and the external weights .",
    "typically one fixes the topological structure and varies the weights .",
    "this is particularly insightful when @xmath785 , which delivers graphs without topological cluster structure : in this case , the question whether there are clusters or not depends entirely on the weights .",
    "as we have remarked above , the planted @xmath293-partition model generates mutually interconnected random graphs  la erds - rnyi .",
    "therefore , all vertices have approximately the same degree .",
    "moreover , all communities have exactly the same size by construction .",
    "these two features are at odds with what is observed in graph representations of real systems .",
    "degree distributions are usually skewed , with many vertices with low degree coexisting with a few vertices with high degree .",
    "a similar heterogeneity is also observed in the distribution of cluster sizes , as we shall see in section  [ sec7_1 ] .",
    "so , the planted @xmath293-partition model is not a good description of a real graph with community structure .",
    "however , the model can be modified to account for the heterogeneity of degrees and community sizes . a modified version of the model , called _ gaussian random partition generator _",
    ", was designed by brandes et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the cluster sizes have a gaussian distribution , so they are not the same , although they do not differ much from each other .",
    "the heterogeneity of the cluster sizes introduces a heterogeneity in the degree distribution as well , as the expected degree of a vertex depends on the number of vertices of its cluster .",
    "still , the variability of degree and cluster size is not appreciable . besides , vertices of the same cluster keep having approximately the same degree .",
    "a better job in this direction has been recently done by lancichinetti et al .",
    "( lfr benchmark )  @xcite .",
    "they assume that the distributions of degree and community size are power laws , with exponents @xmath786 and @xmath787 , respectively .",

    "a sequence of community sizes obeying the prescribed power law distribution is extracted .",
    "this is done by picking random numbers from a power law distribution with exponent @xmath787 .",
    "each vertex @xmath67 of a community receives an internal degree @xmath791 , where @xmath105 is the degree of vertex @xmath67 , which is taken by a power law distribution with exponent @xmath786 . in this way",
    ", each vertex @xmath67 has a number of stubs @xmath791 .",
    "all stubs of vertices of the same community are randomly attached to each other , until no more stubs are `` free '' . in this way the sequence of internal degrees of each vertex in its community is maintained .",
    "each vertex @xmath67 receives now an additional number of stubs , equal to @xmath792 ( so that the final degree of the vertex is @xmath105 ) , that are randomly attached to vertices of different communities , until no more stub is `` free '' .",

    "then , vertices are randomly assigned to one of four equally - sized communities .",
    "finally , pairs of edges between two communities are rewired so that either edge ends up within the same community , without altering the degree sequence ( on average ) .",

    "correctly or incorrectly classified is somewhat arbitrary , though .",
    "apart from the fraction of correctly classified vertices , which is somewhat _ ad hoc _ and distinguishes the roles of the natural partition and of the algorithm s partition , most similarity measures can be divided in three categories : measures based on _ pair counting _ , _ cluster matching _ and _ information theory_.    measures based on pair counting depend on the number of pairs of vertices which are classified in the same ( different ) clusters in the two partitions .",

    "unadjusted indices have the drawback that they are not local , i.  e. the result depends on how the whole graph is partitioned , even when the partitions differ only in a small region of the graph .",

    "all benchmarks start from a situation in which communities are clearly identified , i.  e. connected components of the graph , and introduce some amount of noise , that eventually leads to a scenario where clusters are hardly or no longer detectable .",
    "it is then important to keep track of how the quality of the natural partition of the benchmark worsens as the amount of noise increases , in order to distinguish configurations in which the graphs have a cluster structure , that an algorithm should then be able to resolve , from configurations in which the noise prevails and the natural clusters are not meaningful .",
    "moreover , quality functions are important to evaluate the performance of an algorithm on graphs whose community structure is unknown .",
    "quality functions are strongly related to the concept of community as well , as they are supposed to evaluate the goodness of the clusters , so they require a clear quantitative concept of what a cluster is .",

    "this issue has so far received very little attention  @xcite .",
    "finally , empirical tests are also very important , as one ultimately wishes to apply clustering techniques to real graphs .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to collect more data sets of graphs whose community structure is known or deducible from information on the vertices and their edges .",
    "what are the general properties of partitions and clusters of real graphs ? in many papers on graph clustering applications to real systems are presented . in spite of the variety of clustering methods that one could employ , in many cases partitions derived from different techniques",

    "the analysis of clusters and their properties delivers a _ mesoscopic description _ of the graph , where the communities , and not the vertices , are the elementary units of the topology .",
    "the term mesoscopic is used because the relevant scale here lies between the scale of the vertices and that of the full graph .",

    "despite the remote origins and the great popularity of the last years , research on graph clustering has not yet given a satisfactory solution of the problem and leaves us with a number of important open issues . from our exposition",
    "it appears that the field has grown in a rather chaotic way , without a precise direction or guidelines . in some cases , interesting new ideas and tools",
    "have been presented , in others existing methods have been improved , becoming more accurate and/or faster .    what the field lacks the most is a theoretical framework that defines precisely what clustering algorithms are supposed to do .",
    "everybody has his / her own idea of what a community is , and most ideas are consistent with each other , but , as long as there is still disagreement , it remains impossible to decide which algorithm does the best job and there will be no control on the creation of new methods .",
    "therefore , we believe that the first and foremost task that the scientific community working on graph clustering has to solve in the future is defining a set of reliable benchmark graphs , against which algorithms should be tested ( section  [ sec6_1 ] ) . defining a benchmark goes far beyond the issue of testing .",
    "it means designing practical examples of graphs with communities , and , in order to do that , one has to agree on the fundamental concepts of community and partition .",
    "clustering algorithms have to be devised consistently with such definitions , in order to give the best performance on the set of designated benchmarks , which represent a sort of ground truth .",
    "the explosion in the number of algorithms we have witnessed in recent times is due precisely to the present lack of reliable mechanisms of control of their quality and comparison of their performances .",
    "if the community agrees on a benchmark , the future development of the field will be more coherent and the progress brought by new methods can be evaluated in an unbiased manner .",
    "the planted @xmath293-partition model  @xcite is the easiest recipe one can think of when it comes to defining clusters , and is the criterion underlying well - known benchmarks , like that by girvan and newman .",
    "we believe that the new benchmarks have to be defined along the same lines .",
    "the benchmark graphs recently introduced by lancichinetti et al .",
    "@xcite and by sawardecker et al .",
    "@xcite are an important step in this direction .    defining a benchmark implies specifying the `` natural '' partition of a graph , the one that any algorithm should find .",
    "this issue in turn involves the concept of quality of a partition , that has characterized large part of the development of the field , in particular after the introduction of newman - girvan modularity ( section  [ sec3_2_2 ] ) . estimating the quality of a partition allows to discriminate among the large number of partitions of a graph . in some cases",
    "this is not difficult .",
    "for instance , in the benchmark by girvan and newman there is a single meaningful partition , and it is hard to argue with that . but most graphs of the real world have a hierarchical structure , with communities including smaller communities and so on .",
    "hence there are several meaningful partitions , corresponding to different hierarchical levels , and discriminating among them is hard , as they may be all relevant , in a sense .",
    "if we consider the human body , we can not say that the organization in tissues of the cells is more important than the organization in organs .",
    "we have seen that there are recent methods dealing with the problem of finding meaningful hierarchical levels ( section  [ sub_sec6_20 ] ) .",
    "such methods rank the hierarchical partitions based on some criterion and one can assess their relevance through the ranking .",
    "one may wonder whether it makes sense sorting out levels , which means introducing a kind of threshold on the quality index chosen to rank partitions ( to distinguish `` good '' from `` bad '' partitions ) , or whether it is more appropriate to keep the information given by the whole set of hierarchical partitions .",
    "the work by clauset et al . on hierarchical random graphs",
    "@xcite , discussed in section  [ sub_sec6_202 ] , indirectly raises this issue .",
    "there it was shown that the ensemble of model graphs , represented by dendrograms , encodes most of the information on the structure of the graph at study , like its degree distribution , transitivity and distribution of shortest path lengths . at the same time , by construction , the model reveals the whole hierarchy of communities , without any distinction between good and bad partitions . the information given by a dendrogram may become redundant and confusing when the graph is large , as then there is a big number of partitions",
    "this is actually the reason why quality functions were originally introduced .",
    "however , in that case , one was dealing with artificial hierarchies , produced by techniques that systematically yield a dendrogram as a result of the analysis ( like , e. g. , hierarchical clustering ) , regardless of whether the graph actually has a hierarchical structure or not . here instead we speak of real hierarchy , which is a fundamental element of real graphs and , as such , it must be considered in any serious approach to graph clustering .",
    "any good clustering method must be able to tell whether a graph has community structure or not , and , in the first case , whether the community structure is hierarchical ( i. e. with two or more levels ) or flat ( one level ) .",
    "we expect that the concept of hierarchy will become a key ingredient of future clustering techniques .",
    "in particular , assessing the consistence of the concepts of partitions quality and hierarchical structure is a major challenge .    a precise definition of null models , i. e. of graphs without community structure , is also missing .",
    "this aspect is extremely important , though , as defining communities also implies deciding whether or not they exist in a specific graph . at the moment",
    ", it is generally accepted that random graphs have no communities .",
    "the null model of modularity ( section  [ sec3_2_2 ] ) , by far the most popular , comprises all graphs with the same expected degree sequence of the original graph and random rewiring of edges .",
    "this class of graphs is characterized , by construction , by the fact that any vertex can be linked to any other , as long as the constraint on the degree sequence is satisfied .",
    "but this is by no means the only possibility .",
    "a community can be generically defined as a subgraph whose vertices have a higher probability to be connected to the other vertices of the subgraph than to external vertices .",
    "the planted @xmath293-partition model  @xcite is based on this principle , as we have seen .",
    "however , this does not mean that the linking probabilities of a vertex with respect to the other vertices in its community or in different communities be constant ( or simply proportional to their degrees , as in the configuration model  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in large networks it is reasonable to assume that the probability that a vertex is linked to most vertices is zero , as the vertex `` ignores '' their existence .",
    "this does not exclude that the probability that the vertex gets connected to the `` known '' vertices is the same ( or proportional to their degrees ) , in which case the graph would still be random and have no communities .",
    "we believe that we are still far from a precise definition and a complete classification of null models .",
    "this represents an important research line for the future of the field , for three main reasons : 1 ) to better disentangle `` true '' communities from byproducts of random fluctuations ; 2 ) to pose a stringent test to existing and future clustering algorithms , whose reliability would be questionable if they found `` false positives '' in null model graphs ; 3 ) to handle `` hybrid '' scenarios , where a graph displays community structure on some portions of it , while the rest is essentially random and has no communities .    in the previous chapters we have seen a great number of clustering techniques . which one(s",
    ") shall we use ? at the moment",
    "the scientific community is unable to tell .",
    "modularity optimization is probably the most popular method , but the results of the analysis of large graphs are likely to be unreliable ( section  [ sub_sec6_1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , people have become accustomed to use it , and there have been several attempts to improve the measure .",
    "a newcomer , who wishes to find clusters in a given network and is not familiar with clustering techniques , would not know , off - hand , which method to use , and he / she would hardly find indications about good methods in any single paper on graph clustering , except perhaps on the method presented in the paper .",
    "so , people keep using algorithms because they have heard of them , or because they know that other people are using them , or because of the reputation of the scientists who designed them . waiting for future reliable benchmarks , that may give an objective assessment of the quality of the algorithms , there are at the moment hardly solid reasons to prefer an algorithm to another : the comparative analyses by danon et al .",
    "@xcite and by lancichinetti and fortunato  @xcite ( section  [ sec6_3 ] ) represent a first serious assessment of this issue",
    ". however , we want to stress that there is no such thing as the perfect method , so it is pointless to look for it . among the other things ,",
    "if one tries to look for a very general method , that should give good results on any type of graphs , one is inevitably forced to make very general assumptions on the structure of the graph and on the properties of communities . in this way one",
    "neglects a lot of specific features of the system , that may lead to a more accurate detection of the clusters .",
    "informing a method with features characterizing some types of graphs makes it far more reliable to detect the community structure of those graphs than a general method , even if its applicability may be limited .",
    "therefore in the future we envision the development of domain - specific clustering techniques .",
    "the challenge here is to identify the peculiar features of classes of graphs , which are bound to become crucial ingredients in the design of suitable algorithms .",
    "some of the methods available today are actually based on assumptions that hold only for some specific categories of graphs . the clique percolation method by palla et al .",
    "@xcite , for instance , may work well for graphs characterized by a large number of cliques , like certain social networks , whereas it may give poor results otherwise .",
    "moving one step further , one should learn how to use specific information about a graph , whenever available , e. g. properties of vertices and/or partial information about their classification .",
    "for instance , it may be that one has some information on a subset of vertices , like demographic data on people of a social network , and such data may highlight relationships between people that are not obvious from the network of social interactions . in this case , using only the social network may be reductive and ideally one should exploit both the structural and the non - structural information in the search of clusters , as the latter should be consistent with both inputs . how to do this is an open problem .",
    "the scientific community has just begun to study this aspect  @xcite .",
    "most algorithms in the literature deal with the `` classical '' case of a graph with undirected and unweighted edges .",
    "this is certainly the simplest case one could think of , and graph clustering is already a complex task on such types of graphs .",
    "we know that real networks may be directed , have weighted connections , be bipartite",
    ". methods to deal with such systems have been developed , as we have seen , especially in the most recent literature , but they are mostly preliminary attempts and there is room for improvement .",
    "another situation that may occur in real systems is the presence of edges with positive and negative weights , indicating attractive and repulsive interactions , respectively .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of correlation data  @xcite . in this case",
    ", ideal partitions would have positively weighted intracluster edges and negatively weighted intercluster edges .",
    "we have discussed some studies in this direction  @xcite , but we are just at the beginning of this endeavour",
    ". instead , there are no algorithms yet which are capable to deal with graphs in which there are edges of several types , indicating different kinds of interactions between the vertices ( _ multigraphs _ ) .",
    "agents of social networks , for instance , may be joined by working relationships , friendship , family ties , etc . at the moment",
    "there are essentially two ways of proceeding in these instances : 1 ) keeping edges of one type and forgetting the others , repeating the analysis for each type of edges and eventually comparing the results obtained ; 2 ) analyzing a single ( weighted ) graph , obtained by `` combining '' the contributions of the different types of edges in some way .",
    "finally , since most real networks are built through the results of experiments , which carry errors in their estimates , it would be useful to consider as well the case in which edges have not only associated weights , but also errors on their values .    since the paper by palla et al .",
    "@xcite , overlapping communities have received a lot of attention ( section  [ sec45 ] ) .",
    "however , there is still no consensus about a quantitative definition of the concept of overlapping community , and most definitions depend on the method adopted .",
    "intuitively , one would expect that clusters share vertices lying at their borders , and this idea has inspired most algorithms .",
    "however , clusters detected with the clique percolation method ( section  [ sec45_1 ] ) often share central vertices of the clusters , which makes sense in specific instances , especially in social networks .",
    "so , it is still unclear how to characterize overlapping vertices .",
    "moreover , the concept of overlapping clusters seems at odds with that of hierarchical structure .",
    "no dendrogram can be drawn if there are overlapping vertices , at least in the standard way .",
    "due to the relevance of both features in real networks , it is necessary to adapt them to each other in a consistent way .",
    "overlapping vertices pose problems as well when it comes to comparing the results of different methods on the same graph .",
    "most similarity measures are defined only in the case of partitions , where each vertex is assigned to a single cluster ( section  [ sec6_2 ] ) .",
    "it is then necessary to extend such definitions to the case of overlapping communities , whenever possible .",
    "another issue that is getting increasingly more popular is the study of graphs evolving in time .",
    "this is now possible due to the availability of timestamped network data sets .",
    "tracking the evolution of community structure in time is very important , to uncover how communities are generated and how they interact with each other .",
    "scholars have just begun to study this problem  @xcite ( section  [ sec7_1_2 ] ) .",
    "typically one analyzes separately snapshots at different times and checks what happened at time @xmath690 to the communities at time @xmath156",
    ". it would be probably better to use simultaneously the whole dynamic data set , and future work shall aim at defining proper ways to do that . in this respect , the evolutionary clustering framework by chakrabarti et al .",
    "@xcite is a promising starting point .",
    "the computational complexity of graph clustering algorithms has improved by at least one power in the graph size ( on average ) in just a couple of years .",
    "due to the large size of many systems one wishes to investigate , the ultimate goal would be to design techniques with linear or even sublinear complexity .",
    "nowadays partitions in graphs with up to millions of vertices can be found . however , the results are not yet very reliable , as they are usually obtained by greedy optimizations , which yield rough approximations of the desired solution . in this respect",
    "the situation could improve by focusing on the development of efficient local methods , for two reasons : 1 ) they enable analyses of portions of the graph , independently of the rest ; 2 ) they are often suitable for parallel implementations , which may speed up considerably the computation .",
    "finally , if there has been a tremendous effort in the design of clustering algorithms , basically nothing has been done to make sense of their results .",
    "what shall we do with communities ?",
    "what can they tell us about a system ?",
    "the hope is that they will enable one to disclose `` hidden '' relationships between vertices , due to features that are not known , because they are hard to measure , for instance .",

    "there are two parameters : the number of vertices @xmath15 and the connection probability @xmath45 .",
    "each pair of vertices is connected with equal probability @xmath45 independently of the other pairs .",
    "the expected number of edges of the graph is @xmath943 , and the expected mean degree @xmath944 .",
    "the degree distribution of the vertices of a random graph is binomial , and in the limit @xmath945 , @xmath946 for fixed @xmath420 it converges to a poissonian .",
    "therefore , the vertices have all about the same degree , close to @xmath420 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , top ) .",
    "the most striking property of this class of graphs is the phase transition observed by varying @xmath420 in the limit @xmath945 . for @xmath947 , the graph is separated in connected components , each of them being microscopic , i.  e. occupying but a vanishing portion of the system size . for @xmath948 , instead , one of the components becomes macroscopic ( _ giant component _ ) , i.  e. it occupies a finite fraction of the graph vertices .",
    "the diameter of a random graph with @xmath15 vertices is very small , growing only logarithmically with @xmath15 .",
    "this property ( _ small - world effect _ ) is very common in many real graphs . the first evidence that social networks are characterized by paths of small length",
    "was provided by a series of famous experiments conducted by the phychologist stanley milgram  @xcite .",
    "the expected clustering coefficient of a vertex of a random graph is @xmath45 , as the probability for two vertices to be connected is the same whether they are neighbors of the same vertex or not .",
    "real graphs , however , are characterized by far higher values of the clustering coefficient as compared to random graphs of the same size .",
    "watts and strogatz  @xcite showed that the small world property and high clustering coefficient can coexist in the same system .",
    "they designed a class of graphs which result from an interpolation between a regular lattice , which has high clustering coefficient , and a random graph , which has the small - world property .",
    "one starts from a ring lattice in which each vertex has degree @xmath44 , and with a probability @xmath45 each edge is rewired to a different target vertex ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , center ) .",
    "it turns out that low values of @xmath45 suffice to reduce considerably the length of shortest paths between vertices , because rewired edges act as shortcuts between initially remote regions of the graph . on the other hand ,",
    "the clustering coefficient remains high , since few rewired edges do not perturb appreciably the local structure of the graph , which remains similar to the original ring lattice .",
    "for @xmath811 all edges are rewired and the resulting structure is a random graph  la erds and rnyi .",
    "the seminal paper of watts and strogatz triggered a huge interest towards the graph representation of real systems .",
    "one of the most important discoveries was that the distribution of the vertex degree of real graphs is very heterogeneous  @xcite , with many vertices having few neighbors coexisting with some vertices with many neighbors .",
    "in several cases the tail of this distribution can be described as a power law with good approximation , hence the expression _ scale - free networks_. such degree heterogeneity is responsible for a number of remarkable features of real networks , such as resilience to random failures / attacks  @xcite , and the absence of a threshold for percolation  @xcite and epidemic spreading  @xcite .",
    "the most popular model of a graph with a power law degree distribution is the model by barabsi and albert  @xcite .",
    "a version of the model for directed graphs had been proposed much earlier by de solla price  @xcite , building up on previous ideas developed by simon  @xcite .",
    "the graph is created with a dynamic procedure , where vertices are added one by one to an initial core .",
    "the probability for a new vertex to set an edge with a preexisting vertex is proportional to the degree of the latter . in this way ,",
    "vertices with high degree have large probability of being selected as neighbors by new vertices ; if this happens , their degree further increases so they will be even more likely to be chosen in the future . in the asymptotic limit of infinite number of vertices ,",
    "this _ rich - gets - richer _ strategy generates a graph with a degree distribution characterized by a power - law tail with exponent @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( bottom ) we show an example of barabsi - albert ( ba ) graph .",
    "the clustering coefficient of a ba graph decays with the size of the graph , and it is much lower than in real networks .",
    "moreover , the power law decays of the degree distributions observed in real networks are characterized by a range of exponents values ( usually between @xmath323 and @xmath3 ) , whereas the ba model yields a fixed value . however",
    ", many refinements of the ba model as well as plenty of different models have been later introduced to account more closely for the features observed in real systems ( for details see  @xcite ) ."
