    "the elliptical shape , the overall structure of this overdensity and its coincidence with a noticeable grouping of globular clusters @xcite led @xcite to the conclusion that it is the relic of the dwarf galaxy whose disruption generated the ring . the discovered relic ( hereafter canis major galaxy , cma ) is approximately centered at galactic coordinates ( l , b)@xmath6",
    ", it has a fwhm extension in the sky of @xmath7 in the latitude direction and it is located at @xmath8 kpc from the sun ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) , as obtained from the photometric parallax to m - giants introduced by @xcite .",
    "the mass , luminosity and characteristic dimensions of canis major appear quite similar to those of the sgr dsph .",
    "the similarity with sgr extends to other relevant characteristics : the two objects seem to host a similar grouping of globular clusters , and the upper rgb of both galaxies is dominated by stars of similar colour ( m - giants ) , which are present in similar numbers in both galaxies .",

    "furthermore the distance scale based on photometric parallax of m - giants is intrinsically uncertain @xcite and it is likely affected by a systematic effect leading to the underestimate of true distances @xcite .",
    "hence , the detection of fainter stars belonging to the newly discovered galaxy , the access to alternative distance indicators than m - giants and the study of its stellar population in other wavelength ranges ( than the nir ) are highly desirable to confirm the discovery presented in pap - i and to obtain a clearer characterization of the system .    here",
    "we present the first detection of the main sequence ( ms ) of the cma system in a wide field located @xmath14 apart from its center , from deep b and v photometry of very recent eso - wfi images taken from the eso archive .",
    "we also take advantage of the fact that the low latitude region of sky covered by the cma galaxy hosts a number of galactic open clusters ( oc ) , most of them in the foreground .",
    "thus we searched for existing wide field ccd photometry of these open clusters to look for evidence of a background population that may be related to the cma galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , modern wide field photometries of open clusters are quite rare since , typically , a field of few arcmin is sufficient to characterize the population of these clusters and the background population is an undesired contaminant for these kind of studies .",
    "nevertheless , some interesting clues of the presence of cma stars in these fields have been obtained , providing useful indications on the spatial extent of the system and guidance for future observations .",
    "the list of the fields considered in the current study is reported in table  1 , where we report the position of the fields in galactic coordinates , the field of view covered by the available observations , the angular distance from the center of cma , an estimate of the reddening and the source of the data .",

    "the results presented here should be regarded as a significant progress in the understanding of the cma system as well as a confirmation of its existence .    criticizing the results presented in @xcite and in a previous preliminary version of the present paper circulated as a preprint , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter m04 ) claimed that the cma overdensity is completely due to the north - south asymmetry produced by the galactic warp ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the classical parameter adopted to quantify the asymmetry produced by the warp at a given ( @xmath21 ) is the ratio between the counts ( of any given density tracer ) in the northern galactic hemisphere and the counts in the corresponding region in the southern hemisphere ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 . at the longitudes of the maximum amplitude of the warp , r is @xmath24 in the southern warp @xcite . here , since we deal with southern structures we will use @xmath25 .",

    "note that computing @xmath26 from a homogeneous dataset ( as , for instance 2mass ) removes most of the problems associated with the incompleteness of the samples since the parameter is the _ ratio _ of starcounts from samples with very similar completeness as a function of magnitude .",
    ".,width=317 ]    the key point of the following analysis is that if the cma overdensity is due to the southern galactic warp we shall observe similar overdensities and populations also around @xmath19 where the warp asymmetry should be similar if not larger . to do this comparison we carefully selected two windows of low reddening @xmath28 and of low average reddening @xmath29 and their respective control fields in the northern hemisphere with the same reddening constraints .",
    "the data have been taken from 2mass adopting the same selections as in @xcite .",

    "the data have been corrected for extinction according to the sfd98 maps .",

    "if we imagine the galactic disc as a series of concentric circular rings with the outermost rings tilted ( because of the warp , see * ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) the structures at @xmath44 ( cma ) and at @xmath45 ( warp ) should lie at the same galactocentric distance , i.e. in the same _ ring_. seen from the sun , this ring should appear more distant in the warp direction , as observed , given the fainter rc peak detected in the warp field .",
    "however , to obtain the observed difference in the magnitude of the peaks ( @xmath46 mag ) the warped ring should lie at a galactocentric distance of @xmath47 kpc , implying a distance of the cma structure from the sun of @xmath48 kpc , in sharp contrast with the observations ( see pap - i and sect .  2.5 , above ) .",
    "on the other hand , assuming a realistic sun - cma distance of @xmath49 kpc , the difference between the two peaks should be @xmath50 mag , much larger than observed . the only way to save the original hypothesis , that the overdensities in the cma and warp directions belong to the same warped ring of the galactic disc ,",
    "is to admit that such a ring _ is not circular _ , but significantly elliptical instead ( axis ratio @xmath51 ) . even in this ( very unlikely ) case",

    "here there is no more peak in the warp direction .",
    "for @xmath53 the @xmath26 distribution of the @xmath45 field settles at the typical `` warp '' value ( dotted line ) while the cma peak is as strong and well defined as at lower latitudes and in the same position .",
    "this comparison alone shows that ( a ) toward @xmath54 the south / north asymmetry in rc stars is significantly larger than in the warp field ( a difference larger than @xmath55 at @xmath56 ) and ( b ) the excess of counts in the cma direction is confined to a well defined range of magnitudes corresponding to the distance of the cma galaxy as obtained in pap - i and in sect .",
    "2.5 , here .",
    "it should be concluded that while around @xmath57 the distribution of rc stars is fully consistent with what is expected from the galactic warp ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the @xmath58 direction a clear and unexpected overdensity is observed at the distance of @xmath5 kpc , fully consistent with the results of pap - i . it should be noted that the overdensity detected in the cma direction is not only a south / north excess of starcounts in a limited range of distances but it is a clear excess _ with respect to what observed in the real warp _ , i.e. in the @xmath57 direction .",
    "the result is confirmed also in the latitude range @xmath59 , where the cma peak begins to weaken , as expected ( see fig .",
    "6 of pap - i ) while the warp distribution is essentially unchanged ( in agreement with the results by * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "finally , in the hypothesis that the south / north asymmetries observed in the cma and warp fields are both due to the galactic warp , one can object that since the warp ring has a larger heliocentric distance in the @xmath57 direction than toward cma , the same @xmath60 range samples different ranges in z ( linear distance from the galactic plane ) in the two directions .",
    "it can be conceived that a comparison of the @xmath26 distributions at the same z is more appropriate than the comparisons shown in fig .",
    "let us consider two possible scenarios :    1 .",
    "if we assume that the warp lies on a circular ring at the same galactocentric distance as the _ observed _ cma overdensity then the @xmath59 range toward cma samples the same range in z than the @xmath35 range in the warp direction . comparing the cma distribution in the lower panel of fig .  12 with that of the warp field in the upper panel of the same figure it can be noted that the amplitude of the peaks is similar ( the cma peak being still the strongest of the two ) but the difference in magnitude between the peaks is again @xmath61 mag , which would force the conclusion that the warp is elliptical ( already discussed above ) .",
    "2 .   if we assume that the real difference in distance modulus between the warp as seen toward @xmath44 and toward @xmath45 is @xmath61 mag , as indicated by the position of the @xmath26 peaks in the upper panel of fig .",
    "12 , then the comparison at the `` same z '' should be done between the cma distribution at @xmath52 and the warp distribution at @xmath35 . since the cma @xmath26 distribution is essentially unchanged in the two latitude strips ( upper and middle panels of fig .",
    "12 ) this hypothesis must be rejected : the cma peak is much higher and at a different galactocentric distance with respect to the peak at @xmath45 ( possibly ) attributable to the galactic warp .",
    "note that this peak is seen only at @xmath35 , while it is completely lacking at higher latitudes .",
    "hence , the consideration of this possible effect is of no help to the m04 hypothesis : the observed @xmath26 distribution of rc stars in the cma field can not be reconciled with the @xmath26 distribution in the _ real _ warp ( warp field ) .",
    "essentially the same results are obtained from m giants , as shown in fig .  13 . in this case , since the tracers are much less numerous than rc stars and the signal - to - noise ratio of any structure is consequently lower , we had to adopt a coarser grid to compute @xmath26 and the final result is best appreciated when shown as the difference between the @xmath26 distributions in the considered directions ( @xmath62 ) vs. @xmath63 ) .",
    "it is clearly evident that the only significant excess is the broad peak in the range @xmath64 that is detected in all of the considered latitude ranges . note",
    "that fig .",
    "13 is directly showing excesses in star counts in the cma direction _",
    "with respect to the warp direction _ , hence the cma clump of stars clearly emerges _ over _ the south / north overdensity due to the warp .",
    "it must be concluded that the observed @xmath26 distributions of rc stars and m giants toward @xmath44 and toward @xmath45 are in clear contrast with the claim that the overdensity discovered in pap - i and studied here is due to the galactic warp ( m04 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the observational evidence confirms that around @xmath65 , at @xmath66 kpc from the sun , there is a previously unknown stellar system that is clearly detected even above the underlying asymmetry due to the galactic warp : the canis major galaxy .",
    "the optical ( photographic ) photometry provided by the gsc2.2 catalogue is a much less homogeneous dataset with respect to 2mass .",
    "the effect of interstellar extinction is much stronger in the gsc2.2 passbands ( @xmath67,@xmath68 ) and the corresponding reddening laws are not well known . on the other hand a direct test performed on",
    "the f - xmm showed that the limiting magnitude of gsc2.2 photometry is @xmath69 mag fainter than that of 2mass at @xmath70 .",
    "hence the inspection of the gsc2.2 data may provide additional insight in the comparison between the cma overdensity and the galactic warp .",
    "we have selected from the gsc2.2 two small circular regions of radius @xmath71 toward the cma and warp directions and their respective northern control fields .",
    "the fields have been selected to have small and homogeneous reddening ( see tab .  2 , for details ) .",
    "comparison among the overall lf of the four fields indicates that the completeness of the samples is very similar down to @xmath72 .",
    "small color shifts ( @xmath73 mag ) have been applied to match the main features of the corresponding cmds .",
    "we stress that the result discussed below is completely independent of the assumed shifts .",
    "the cmds of the selected fields are shown in fig .",
    "a detailed analysis of the diagrams suggests that there are differences in the stellar populations of the various fields , particularly at faint magnitudes , and the study of lfs of selected populations provides results fully compatible with those described in the previous section , above .",
    "however , given the possible problems with reddening corrections and the uncertain homogeneity of the samples we drop this part of the analysis and concentrate on a single feature of the cmd , i.e. the blue plume . in pap - i and ( above all ) in sect .  2 and 3.1 above we have shown that the bp population is a distinctive feature of the cma system .",
    "14 shows that this feature emerges clearly also from the gsc2.2 data : the well populated bp observed in the cma direction ( upper left panel of fig .",
    "14 ) has no counterpart in any of the other considered fields .",
    "in particular the excess of bp stars ( falling in the selection box reported in fig .  14 ) in the cma field with respect to the warp field is at the @xmath74 level , i.e. very large and significant .",
    "this finding provides additional support to the conclusions of the previous section and indicates that there is at least a significant difference in the stellar populations hosted by the cma system and by the galactic warp .",
    "m04 derived proper motions of m giants in the cma overdensity and found that the tangential velocity of these stars is compatible with that of galactic disc stars at similar distance .",
    "here we simply note that this observation does not provide any conclusive argument on the nature of cma since the uncertainties in the measured proper motions leave room for differences in tangential velocity as large as @xmath75 km / s . in a dedicated contribution",
    "@xcite we show that , on the other hand , cma stars display a systemic radial velocity significantly different from that of disc stars at the same distance , further supporting the idea that cma is an independent stellar system .",
    "in pap - i it has been noted that there is also an apparent overdensity of open clusters in the surroundings of the cma galaxy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the region of the sky considered in the present analysis we found useful photometry only for two of these clusters , namely arp - madore  2 ( am-2 ) and tombaugh  2 ( tom  2 ) .",

    "the cluster population dominates the field ( in the range of magnitudes covered by the available cmd ) at least out to the edge of the field observed by @xcite though the density profile of the cluster appears to be essentially flat for @xmath81 ( see , also * ? ? ?",
    "the main characteristics of tom  2 are quite similar to that of am-2 , but in this case the wider field of view ( @xmath82 ) of the best available photometry @xcite permits a more fruitful preliminary analysis , in the present context .",
    "tom  2 has the same metallicity as am-2 ( @xmath83 , from high resolution spectroscopy by * ? ? ?",

    "the observed and synthetic cmds of tom  2 have been shifted to the same reddening as f - xmm , correcting for the reddening differences indicated in the plot .",
    "the similarity of the tom  2 population with that of cma is striking and suggests an intimate connection between the cluster and the galaxy , confirming the hypotheses advanced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all of the results and discussion presented above suggests that am-2 and tom  2 are physically associated with the cma system .",
    "a case strictly analogous to that of tom  2 , i.e. a cluster having a population indistinguishable from the dominant population of the parent galaxy , is that of ter  7 in the sgr dsph ( see * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the position , distance and stellar population of the old open clusters am-2 and tombaugh  2 strongly suggest that they are physically associated with the canis major galaxy . using our own photometry and data from 2mass and the gsc2.2 surveys we demonstrate that the claim by momany et al . that the cma overdensity is entirely due to the galactic warp is not supported by the existing observations , </S>",
