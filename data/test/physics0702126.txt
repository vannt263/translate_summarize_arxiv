    "the classical theory of dispersion is a subject with a long and noble history @xcite .",
    "although the main features of the phenomenon can be described by treating matter as a continuum characterized by macroscopic quantities such as the electric and magnetic polarizations , it is clear that a truly fundamental theory has to be based on a microscopic model of matter .",
    "we shall now try to summarize some crucial aspects of the problem in an historical perspective , before illustrating the new features of our present approach .    by treating an elementary electric dipole as an oscillator subject to a linear restoring force",
    ", it is possible to obtain a simple expression for the molecular polarizability , i.e.  the complex frequency - dependent linear coefficient which relates the microscopic dipole moment to the amplitude of the incident electromagnetic radiation . in order to correctly apply this simple model to the description of the behavior of a large system of mutually interacting dipoles",
    ", one has however to consider that the field acting on each microscopic oscillator can not be simply identified with the macroscopic electromagnetic field in the medium .",
    "in fact , while the latter simply represents the average of the microscopic field over a region much larger than the intermolecular spacing , the former has to be carefully calculated by evaluating and summing , on the site occupied by the considered dipole , the retarded fields generated by all the other dipoles of the medium .",
    "this `` exciting '' field ( as we shall refer to in the following , although the names `` effective '' or `` local '' field have also been employed in the literature ) was theoretically estimated by lorentz already at the end of nineteenth century @xcite by dividing the medium into two regions separated by a virtual sphere surrounding the considered dipole .",
    "he restricted his attention to the typical situation in which the wavelength of the macroscopic electromagnetic field is of a larger order of magnitude than the average intermolecular spacing , so that one can take for the virtual sphere a radius intermediate between the two .",
    "he then argued that the influence of the portion of the medium lying outside the sphere can be fairly approximated as that of a continuous distribution of electric dipole moment , whereas the sum of the forces exerted by all the dipoles situated inside the sphere can be assumed to vanish in most cases on the basis of symmetry considerations . a rather similar analysis , leading to equivalent conclusions ,",
    "was also carried out by planck @xcite . with these arguments",
    "one can derive the well - known lorentz ",
    "lorenz formula @xcite , relating the macroscopic dielectric constant of the medium to the molecular polarizability , and it is thus possible to deduce an approximate expression for the dispersion relation of an array of oscillators in the long - wavelength regime ( which generally includes the optical frequencies ) .    a detailed microscopic theory of dispersion in a crystalline solid ,",
    "although with neglect of radiation reaction , was formulated by ewald @xcite .",
    "he considered a rectangular parallelepiped as the unit cell of the bravais lattice , and his results were subsequently generalized by born to more general crystal structures @xcite .",
    "the mathematical methods used by these authors ( one has to keep in mind that the theory of distributions was not yet existing at that time ) led however to rather clumsy expressions for the exciting field , which could be numerically evaluated only in the limit of an infinitely large ratio between wavelength and lattice constant , i.e.  still essentially in the continuum approximation . in this way the previous results by lorentz and planck were recovered for structures with tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "furthermore , in the case of parallelepipeds of unequal edges , ewald was able to perform in the same limit a numerical calculation relating the ratio between the edges to the phenomenon of double refraction .",
    "finally , ewald extended his analysis of the model also to the study of x - ray diffraction @xcite , but he made use to this purpose of other important simplifications which are possible only in the opposite limit of a radiation frequency much higher that the characteristic frequencies of the crystal .",
    "many investigations were later devoted to the application of quantum mechanics to the theory of light dispersion , and the results of ewald and born were apparently considered to be the final word about the problem of the mutual interaction of a large array of classical resonators .",
    "we are going to prove that , on the contrary , a deeper analysis reveals important properties of this fundamental dynamical system which have been for many decades completely overlooked .    in the present paper",
    "we shall study a system of infinitely many charged particles , subject to linear restoring forces towards their equilibrium positions at the sites of a regular lattice , and interacting with each other through the retarded electromagnetic fields .",
    "our outset will therefore be similar to ewalds s , but with inclusion in the equations of motion of the usual `` triple - dot '' radiation reaction term , which corresponds to the nonrelativistic form of the lorentz ",
    "dirac equation @xcite .",
    "the only approximation that we shall use is that of small oscillations : this will allow us still to deal with a system of linear equations .",
    "we shall provide a general and rigorous procedure for the calculation of the exciting field , avoiding to introduce at any stage of the procedure the continuum approximation .",
    "this will be accomplished by a method involving the careful subtraction of two divergent quantities ( representing respectively the total field and the field generated by the dipole under consideration ) , which appears to be more powerful than that used by ewald and born , and presents some formal analogy with the renormalization techniques of quantum field theory . using our procedure",
    "we shall show that for an infinite regular lattice there exists a continuous set of normal modes which describe the propagation of plane electromagnetic waves",
    ".    a remarkable result will be that the inclusion of the radiation damping term in the equations of motion of the oscillating particles , instead of giving rise to an extinction coefficient for the wave , as is commonly believed according to the standard approximated treatments of the model , is on the contrary essential for justifying the presence of undamped collective waves .",
    "such a result in fact constitutes an extension to the three dimensional case of an analogous one already obtained by two of the present authors for the case of a rectilinear chain of one - dimensional oscillators @xcite .",
    "it relies upon a remarkable identity which was originally formulated in a different context by wheeler and feynman @xcite .",
    "these authors deduced it from the hypothesis of the `` complete absorber '' , which they introduced in order make their time - reversible action - at - a - distance electrodynamics compatible with the observed phenomenon of radiation reaction . for the physical system here",
    "considered we are going to prove in a simple and direct way that , although no absorption mechanism is present in the model , this `` wheeler  feynman identity '' actually holds as a purely mathematical property of the entire class of solutions on which we are interested .    by numerically studying the dispersion relations for the crystal , as resulting from the exact solutions of the model , it will also be shown that completely new features appear for frequencies in a region about the proper frequency of the oscillators . in such a region",
    "the wavelength can in fact become as short as the lattice spacing , so that the approximations adopted in the previous literature become unavailable , and only an exact solution can give predictions about the behavior of the system .",
    "it is found that inside the interval of frequencies where undamped wave propagation was believed to be impossible , plane waves can actually propagate , with very low group velocities , along certain lattice directions and for appropriate wave polarization .",
    "let us consider an infinite three - dimensional simple bravais lattice , that is an array of points @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the triple of relative integers @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are a set of primitive translation vectors for the lattice @xcite .",

    "@xmath8 clearly represents the volume of the primitive cell .",

    "although it is not strictly necessary for the mathematical self - consistency of the model , in order to reproduce in a more realistic way the situation of solid state physics we can assume that @xmath9  is also the seat of a static positive ion of charge @xmath14 .",
    "as is traditionally the case for the classical models of dispersion , we shall neglect the coulomb interaction between the ion and its associated electron , since classical mechanics fails at such short distance scales , and we shall instead identify the proper oscillator frequency @xmath15 with a characteristic excitation frequency of the optical electron in the atomic ground state . according to quantum mechanics , it could even be possible to obtain a more realistic model by associating to each atom a set of fictitious oscillators @xcite , one for each allowed quantum transition from the ground state of energy @xmath16 to an excited state of energy @xmath17 , with proper frequencies @xmath18 . in order to assign to the contribution of each oscillator an appropriate weight",
    ", one has then to make the substitution @xmath19 , where the `` oscillator strengths '' @xmath20  are coefficients subject to the sum rule @xmath21 ( we are considering here atoms with a single optically active electron ) .",
    "an explicit calculation from first order perturbation theory provides @xmath22 @xmath23 being the position operator and @xmath24 the unit vector representing the direction of oscillation . for the sake of simplicity we shall consider in the following calculations a single oscillator per atom , in accordance with the original literature on classical dispersion , although the extension to the case of multiple oscillators presents no conceptual difficulty .",

    "one obtains the dispersion relation @xmath308 while the second case ( longitudinal polarization ) can occur only when @xmath309 , independently of the value of @xmath310 .",
    "these relations are represented in the figure by the thick solid lines .",
    "the curve corresponding to transversal polarization presents a vertical asymptote for @xmath311 , whereas that for longitudinal polarization is obviously just a vertical straight line at @xmath312 .",
    "according to the standard theory no propagation is possible in the frequency interval between @xmath313 and @xmath314 .",
    "a further dispersion curve for transversal polarization is present for @xmath315 , according to both the approximated and the exact theory , but its onset in the figure is practically indistinguishable from the frequency axis .",
    "note that , for the particular numerical values that we have considered , one has @xmath316 and @xmath317 , so that @xmath318 , @xmath319 and @xmath320 .        as one could expect",
    ", one can notice that the predictions of our exact theory depart in a significant way from those of the approximated one as soon as @xmath321 becomes of order of magnitude comparable to unity .",
    "this situation of course corresponds to the fact that the lattice parameter is no longer negligible with respect to the wavelength .",
    "a new feature which is revealed by the exact theory is the appearance , even for a perfect cubic lattice , of an anisotropic behavior , consisting in a remarkable dependence of the dispersion relation on the direction of propagation and polarization of the plane waves .",
    "the two thin solid curves at the opposite sides of the figure , which both refer to the direction of propagation @xmath322 $ ] , correspond to transversal ( the lower frequency one ) and longitudinal polarization respectively .",
    "if one considers the dependence of @xmath323 as a function of @xmath310 which is described by the former curve , one can see that the frequency reaches a maximum  which corresponds to a zero of the group velocity @xmath324  and then slowly decreases over a wide region of the @xmath310 axis extending until the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "this means that there exists a relatively small interval of the frequency axis with the property that , for each @xmath55 belonging to this interval , there are two transversal modes with direction of propagation along a crystal axis and different values of the wavelength .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs also for the lowest - frequency branch of the dashed curve , which corresponds to a wave again polarized along a crystal axis , but propagating along the @xmath325 $ ] direction .",
    "a completely different dispersion relation is shown instead by a wave propagating in the same direction , but transversely polarized along the @xmath326 $ ] direction .",
    "this is illustrated by the intermediate branch of the dashed line .",
    "for this curve the frequency monotonically increases with @xmath310 over the entire brillouin zone , but with a slope  and therefore a group velocity of the associated waves  which drops to a relatively small value when @xmath323 approaches and then exceeds @xmath313 . at the edge of the brillouin zone",
    "this branch joins continuously , at a point with vertical tangent , the third branch of the same curve , which corresponds to longitudinal polarization .",
    "this branch extends up to @xmath314 , where a new transversal branch begins .",
    "it follows that , at distinction with the modes propagating along the @xmath322 $ ] direction , there is no forbidden frequency zone for waves propagating along the @xmath325 $ ] direction . of course , no hint about the existence of such a phenomenon could have been derived from the standard theory . a very similar behavior is shown by the dash - dot curve , corresponding to waves propagating along the @xmath327 $ ] direction . here again the branch with transversal and that with longitudinal polarization join continuously at the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "note that , whereas a wave propagating along the @xmath325 $ ] direction can be transversely polarized along two directions ( the @xmath328 $ ] and @xmath326 $ ] ) with distinct symmetry properties and so also with different dispersion relations , the two possible transversal polarizations are degenerate for waves propagating along either the @xmath322 $ ] or @xmath327 $ ] directions .",
    "for all the curves displayed in fig .  1 , the polarization vector @xmath54 is either parallel or orthogonal to the wavevector @xmath268 .",
    "we would like to point out however that this fact is not a general property of the the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ maineq ] ) , but is rather a consequence of the special symmetry of the particular directions of propagation that we have considered .",
    "note also that the continuous links between the transversal and the longitudinal branches of the curves can be seen as an obvious consequence of the particular degeneracy of the matrix @xmath329 when @xmath330 and @xmath331 .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new refined version of the classical dispersion theory of electromagnetic radiation in a crystalline solid , which has been completely described at a microscopic level as an infinite regular array of charged oscillators , without ever making use of the continuum approximation .",
    "it has been shown that , when the wavelength is comparable with the lattice parameter , the predictions provided by our calculations differ in a remarkable way from those derived from the old standard approximated formulas . in particular , in the region near the proper frequency of the oscillators , which was believed to represent a forbidden gap for light propagation , the phenomenon of `` slow light '' ( i.e.  light propagation with small group velocity ) is found instead to take place along appropriate crystal directions .",
    "the model we have studied is however interesting in itself also from a purely theoretical point of view , independently of its phenomenological implications .",
    "it is in fact an exceptional case of a completely solvable model ( although in the dipole approximation ) in which the radiation reaction force acting on classical charged point particles is fully taken into account .",
    "actually , it turns out that the inclusion of this force has fundamental implications on the qualitative properties of the solutions , allowing for the existence of undamped collective oscillations .",
    "another interesting feature is that , although the model was formulated in terms of the usual maxwell  lorentz electrodynamics with lorentz ",
    "dirac selfinteraction , it is also compatible with the action - at - a - distance electrodynamics which was proposed by wheeler and feynman in 1945 @xcite .",
    "in fact , when the wheeler ",
    "feynman identity is verified , the two theories lead to the same equations of motion for the charged particles .",
    "of course the investigations that we have presented here can be developed and extended in several directions .",
    "one of these , which appears to be particularly significant also from a phenomenological point of view , is the study of the behavior of a semi - infinite lattice occupying only one half of the full three - dimensional space .",
    "this investigation should clarify the relationship between the normal modes of the crystal  which we have described in the present work  and the observable electromagnetic radiation propagating in the free half - space , i.e.  the phenomena of refraction and reflection at the surface of the crystal . in this way it is to be expected that classical fundamental results , such as the ewald  oseen extinction theorem @xcite , will be justified on the basis of the detailed microscopic dynamics of the complete system .",
