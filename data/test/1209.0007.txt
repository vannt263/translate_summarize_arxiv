    "strong magnetic fields drastically affect dynamics of the strong interaction .",
    "such strong magnetic fields were / are created in the early universe , heavy - ion collision experiments , and magnetars  @xcite .",
    "a magnetic field modifies the energy spectrum of particles , in particular , charged particles .",
    "the energy levels of charged particles are quantized , which is the so - called landau quantization , due to circular motion by the lorentz force .",
    "in addition to the landau quantization , the anomalous zeeman splitting happens for the particles with spin .",
    "the energy levels of free charged particles in a background magnetic field parallel to @xmath0 axis are given as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the @xmath2-factor .",
    "masses of charged hadrons are expected to obey this formula in the weak magnetic field limit .",
    "for example , charged pions become heavier in a magnetic field as @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the polarized charged @xmath4 mesons become lighter as @xmath5 , where the @xmath2-factor is estimated as @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the mass of charged @xmath4 mesons becomes zero at the critical magnetic field @xmath7 , and seems imaginary above the critical magnetic field .",
    "the charged vector meson condensation above the critical magnetic field was suggested in hadronic models @xcite .",
    "this condensation was also discussed in more microscopic theories , such as the extended nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl )  @xcite , the lattice qcd simulation @xcite , and models of the gauge / gravity correspondence @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we point out that the charged vector meson condensation can not occur in qcd in a strong magnetic field .",
    "more generally , any global - internal symmetry is not spontaneously broken by a magnetic field . for the vanishing magnetic field , this is known as the vafa - witten theorem  @xcite , which is a consequence of the positivity of the fermion determinant .",
    "the positivity is maintained even in the existence of a magnetic field , so that the vafa - witten theorem works .",
    "we also study how the charged vector meson mass depends on a magnetic field in lattice qcd .",
    "meson masses in a magnetic field have been calculated in a few cases @xcite .",
    "when the strength of a magnetic field exceeds the qcd scale , internal structures of hadrons are important .",
    "lattice qcd is the best way to study hadron properties in a strong magnetic field quantitatively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : theoretical analysis ] , we discuss the possibility of the charged vector meson condensation , and analytically show that the charged vector meson condensation does not occur in a magnetic field . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numericalanalysis ] , we evaluate the meson masses in a magnetic field using lattice qcd and numerically confirm the condensation does not occur .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "we consider two - flavor qcd in a magnetic field .",
    "the up- and down- quark masses are the same and nonzero , @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the strong @xmath9 angle is zero .",
    "we work in euclidean space , and choose @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the lagrangian reads @xmath12 with the qcd field strength @xmath13/g_{\\rm ym}$ ] .",
    "the dirac operator is @xmath14 with the electric charge @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath16 for all @xmath17 , this lagrangian has an internal global @xmath18 symmetry , in addition to space - time ( poincar ) and discrete ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) symmetries .",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the quark mass .",
    "when a constant external magnetic field exists along the @xmath0-direction , parts of these symmetries are explicitly broken .",
    "the global symmetry is broken down into @xmath22 . @xmath19 and @xmath21 are broken while @xmath20 is preserved .",
    "lorentz symmetry is also broken down into @xmath23 .      here",
    ", we discuss the possibility of the charged vector meson condensation in a magnetic field following weinberg s textbook  @xcite .",
    "the order parameters of the charged vector meson condensation are @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we will show that this type of the operator can not condense in qcd ( more generally , vectorlike gauge theories ) . in the vanishing magnetic field , this theorem is called the vafa - witten theorem  @xcite .    since the dirac operator in euclidean space is anti - hermitian , the eigenvalues of the dirac operator are pure imaginary .",
    "in addition , the dirac operator anticommutes with @xmath28 , which implies that the dirac operator has a pair of eigenvalues @xmath29 for nonzero @xmath30 .",
    "this can be shown in the following .",
    "suppose that @xmath31 is the eigenstate of the dirac operator with an eigenvalue @xmath32 ( @xmath30 is real ) , which satisfies the eigenvalue equation , @xmath33 . multiplying both sides of the eigenvalue equation by @xmath34 , one obtains @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , @xmath36 is the eigenstate with an eigenvalue @xmath37 .",
    "this fact implies that the fermion determinant is real and positive : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of zero eigenvalues of the dirac operator . by integrating the fermion degrees of freedom ,",
    "the effective measure is obtained as @xmath40 } \\ , \\ ] ] which is also real and positive . here ,",
    "@xmath41 $ ] is the action of the gauge field .",
    "we define the gauge average with the effective measure as @xmath42 since the effective measure is real and positive , @xmath43 , which plays important role in the qcd inequalities .",
    "another important property of the dirac operator is that the following operator is bounded by the bare quark mass : @xmath44 which is independent of the gauge field . in other words ,",
    "the operator norm of @xmath45 is equal to @xmath46 .",
    "now , let us consider the symmetry breaking .",
    "we write the order parameter as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a normalization factor with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) being the space - time ( momentum space ) volume .",
    "we keep @xmath52 finite to make the calculation well defined : @xmath53 , in the lattice regularization with a lattice spacing @xmath54 .",
    "we assume that symmetry breaking is independent of the choice of regularization schemes since condensation is triggered by infrared dynamics .",
    "the operator @xmath55 depends on the isospin and spinor , which is normalized as @xmath56 . here",
    ", @xmath57 denotes the sum over space - time , isospin , and spinor indices and is normalized to unity . in order to take into account the possibility of an inhomogeneous phase ,",
    "@xmath55 may depend on the space - time coordinate .",
    "for example , if one considers an charge density wave with a single - plane wave , @xmath58 , one may choose @xmath59 ; then @xmath60 .",
    "for the charged vector meson condensation , we can choose @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the function characterizing inhomogeneity .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the order parameter satisfying @xmath63 this is the case with the condensation of the charged - vector meson since it carries the electric charge and its trace vanishes .",
    "it can not , however , be concluded that the symmetry breaking does not occur because this vacuum might be unstable for a small disturbance . to make the discussion of the symmetry breaking precise , we need to add an explicit breaking term @xmath64 into the lagrangian , and we take @xmath65 after all the averages . here , @xmath66 depends on isospins , spinors , and the space - time coordinate .",
    "we assume that @xmath66 is anti - hermitian , which ensures that the effective measure is positive definite .",
    "we also assume that the operator norm of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , is bounded ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "then , the expectation value of @xmath69 with the explicit breaking term becomes @xmath70 if @xmath71 is nonzero , the symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "here , we show @xmath72 .",
    "to see this , let us expand @xmath73 in terms of @xmath74 , @xmath75 where we dropped the @xmath76 term using eq .",
    "( [ eq : vanishingorderparameter ] ) . using the hlder inequality , @xmath77 for linear operators , @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    ", we obtain the absolute value of the coefficient as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is used .",
    "the series is absolute convergent if @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : trf ] ) is bounded for a small perturbation as @xmath83 this bound is independent of gauge configurations and the space - time volume , so that it does not change by the average of the gauge field and the large volume limit . since the bound of @xmath84 is an analytic function of @xmath74 , we can smoothly take @xmath65 . in this limit",
    ", @xmath85 vanishes ; therefore , the charged vector meson condensation does not occur in qcd .    more generally , according to vafa - witten s argument  @xcite",
    ", one can show that no nambu - goldstone boson exists in a magnetic field if @xmath86 .",
    "in other words , any internal symmetry can not be spontaneously broken down in a magnetic field with a nonzero fermion mass as long as ( discrete ) translational symmetry is not broken at least in one direction .",
    "we note that this argument can not apply to the vectorlike theory in which the vector field , @xmath87 , has an electric charge , like the extended njl model  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the given background carries the electric charge , so that @xmath88 may not vanish , where @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the previous argument can not apply , and the charged vector meson condensation can not be excluded .",
    "in fact , the charged vector meson condensation is found in the extended njl model  @xcite .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we discussed that the charged vector meson condensation does not occur . here , we consider the lower bound of the charged vector meson mass .",
    "for this purpose , we apply the so - called qcd inequalities  @xcite , which follows that @xmath90 where we have used the cauchy - schwartz inequality in the second line . here ,",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 are the propagators of up and down quarks , respectively .",
    "thanks to @xmath28 hermiticity of the dirac operator , @xmath93 , it follows that @xmath94 we will call this correlation function in the last line the `` connected '' neutral pion , @xmath95 ( and @xmath96 for the down quark ) . at large distance , @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , @xmath98 .",
    "although the connected neutral pions are not physical neutral pions , they can be calculated in the lattice qcd , as discussed in the next section .",
    "we performed the quenched qcd simulation with @xmath99 . for the quark propagator",
    ", we used the wilson fermion with the hopping parameter @xmath100 .",
    "these parameters correspond to the lattice spacing @xmath101 fm and the meson mass ratio @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "a constant abelian magnetic field is applied in the @xmath0-direction @xcite .",
    "the masses of up and down quarks are the same , but the electric charges are different as @xmath103 . to suppress unnecessary contributions from finite - momentum excited states , all the correlation functions were projected onto @xmath104 by averaging the positions of the source operators in the @xmath0-direction . unlike the usual meson mass calculation without the magnetic field ,",
    "the correlation functions were not projected onto @xmath105 because the background abelian gauge field breaks translational invariance in the @xmath106- and @xmath107-directions .",
    "we calculated the correlation functions @xmath108 of four mesons @xmath109 . for",
    "charged and neutral @xmath4 mesons , we used the correlation function @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "this correlation function couples to both of the polarized and antipolarized ( i.e. , @xmath113 ) components of @xmath4 mesons . only the lowest energy state survives in the large @xmath114 limit .",
    "even if we do not know which component is the lowest energy state , especially of the @xmath115 meson , we can automatically extract the mass of the lowest energy state from this correlation function .",
    "we did not calculate the @xmath116 ( i.e. , @xmath117 ) components of @xmath4 mesons .",
    "it is too difficult to calculate them in lattice qcd . in the background magnetic field ,",
    "the @xmath118-@xmath119 mixing exists even for in the connected diagram .",
    "thus , the @xmath116 component of a @xmath4 meson is an excited state of a pion . at least in the weak magnetic field limit",
    ", there is a large number of magnetic - splitting states of the pion below the energy level of the @xmath4-meson state .",
    "we can not calculate such a highly excited state in the lattice qcd simulation .    for neutral @xmath118 and @xmath4 mesons",
    ", we calculated only the connected diagram , which is necessary for the qcd inequality .",
    "while the disconnected diagram is forbidden in the absence of the magnetic field , it is allowed in the presence of the magnetic field because the magnetic field breaks isospin symmetry .",
    "we ignored the disconnected diagram in this simulation . in this sense ,",
    "our neutral mesons are not physical ones .",

    "this mass shift can be explained by the naive mass formula @xmath122 . as shown in the figure",
    ", this formula well reproduces the present lattice result in a weak magnetic field .",
    "this behavior was also observed in the full qcd simulation @xcite .",
    "the lattice data slightly deviate from this formula in a strong magnetic field .",
    "the charged @xmath4 meson mass shows a nontrivial dependence on the magnetic field .",

    "the mass has a nonzero minimum .",
    "when the magnetic field is stronger than this value , the mass becomes an increasing function of the magnetic field . as a consequence ,",
    "the charged @xmath4 meson is always massive and heavier than the connected neutral pion in the whole range of the magnetic field .",
    "although the wilson fermion does not have the exact positivity , the present lattice result is consistent with the vafa - witten theorem and the qcd inequality .",
    "the neutral mesons are much more nontrivial . in the naive mass formula ,",
    "neutral particles are independent of a magnetic field .",
    "the lattice result suggests , however , that the neutral meson masses depend on the magnetic field .",
    "this is due to the internal structure of the mesons . to know how the physical neutral mesons behave in a magnetic field",

    "we have analytically and numerically shown that charged vector mesons are not condensed by a magnetic field . in general , a magnetic field can not induce any condensation that breaks global - internal symmetry in qcd .",

    "<S> we show that charged vector mesons can not be condensed by a magnetic field . although some hadron models predict the charged vector meson condensation in a strong magnetic field , we prove , by means of the vafa - witten theorem , that this is not the case in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform the numerical analysis for the meson mass and condensation in lattice qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice qcd data confirm no charged vector meson condensation in a magnetic field . </S>"
