    "in the standard big bang cosmology , the amount of heavy elements synthesized in the universe until the decoupling of matter from primordial radiation is negligibly small ; i.e. , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass fraction of heavy elements ( wagoner , fowler , & hoyle 1967 ) . on the other hand , gas clouds in the present - day galaxies have an appreciable amount of heavy elements @xmath8 ; e.g. , the solar heavy element abundance is @xmath9 .",
    "this means that chemical and thermal properties of gas clouds in primeval galaxies at high redshift are significantly different from those in the present - day galaxies .    just after the recombination of the universe",
    ", the hydrogen gas could be in atomic phase at a temperature of @xmath10 k. then the formation of primordial hydrogen molecules can proceed through the gas phase reaction ( e.g. , peebles & dicke 1968 ) . since the rotational and vibrational transitions in hydrogen molecules can cool the gas further , the first generation stars can be born in such gas clouds at redshift @xmath11 - 30 . since the temperature is still much higher than a typical kinetic temperature of molecular gas clouds in the present - day galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath11 k ) , the initial mass function ( imf ) in primeval galaxies may be different from that in the present - day galaxies ; i.e. , a salpeter - like imf ( salpeter 1955 ; scalo 1986 ) .",
    "therefore , one of fundamental questions on the star formation in primeval galaxies is ; `` what kind of stars ( i.e. , population iii stars ) were made in such extremely metal deficient gas clouds ? \" [ matsuda , sato , & takeda 1969 ; yoneyama 1972 ; yoshii & saio 1986 ( hereafter ys86 ) ; silk 1977a ; tegmark et al .",

    "[ the fragmentation of gas clouds due to the gravitational instability continues until the fragments become to be optically thick to the cooling radiation ( silk 1977b , 1977c ) ] , ys86 first derived an imf for a hydrogen - helium gas cloud .",
    "they found that typical masses of the first - generation stars are from several @xmath0 to 10 @xmath0 .",
    "nakamura & umemura ( 1999 ) obtained similar results based on their one - dimensional hydrodynamical calculations together with nonequilibrium processes for hydrogen molecule formation .",
    "abia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) pointed out that the very large c and n enhancements observed in the extremely metal - poor stars in our galaxy favor a population iii imf peaked at intermediate - mass stars .",
    "recently , on one hand , some groups investigated the collapse and fragmentation of primordial , metal - free gas by numerical simulations ( abel , bryan , & norman 2000 , 2002 ; bromm et al .",
    "1999 , 2001 , 2002 ; coppi et al .",
    "they showed that the first generation gaseous clumps have masses of @xmath12 which corresponds to the jeans mass of the gas with temperature @xmath13 a few 100 k and the density @xmath14 .",
    "as bromm et al .",
    "( 2002 ) assumed , if the clump masses are indicative of the final stellar mass , population iii stars may be more massive than @xmath15 .",
    "nakamura & umemura ( 2001a , 2001b ) have developed their hydrodynamical simulations and found that the initial mass function of population iii stars may be bimodal with peaks of @xmath16  @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the mass depends on the initial density and the initial fraction of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath19 ) ( nakamura & umemura 2001b ) .",
    "if @xmath20 is larger than @xmath21 for low - density ( @xmath22 @xmath23 ) , the effective hd cooling makes the high mass peak small to @xmath24 .",
    "however , if @xmath20 is smaller than @xmath21 , very massive stars with @xmath25 are formed preferentially .    in this way , the mass of first - generation stars is controversial .",
    "it seems also hard to examine observationally which mode is more feasible ; i.e. , population iii stars are either intermediate - mass star or very massive ones .",
    "if most population iii stars are as massive as @xmath25 , they could explode quickly and then contribute to the chemical enrichment of either galaxies or intergalactic medium or both ( e.g. , madau , ferrara , & rees 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "since usual population ii stars could be formed in cold gas clouds polluted chemically by first population iii stars , we can not examine observationally whether or not such very massive stars were really formed in the primordial gas clouds . furthermore , according to nakamura & umemura ( 2001a ) , proto - galactic clouds with a higher density tend to form intermediate - mass stars .",
    "if such proto - galactic systems are present , their evolution can be governed by evolution of the intermediate - mass stars whose lifetime is @xmath26 yr , being much longer than those of very massive stars .",
    "we investigate what happens and follows in such bursts of formation of intermediate - mass stars and discuss effects on the further evolution of galaxies , adopting the imf of ys86 .",
    "in particular , intermediate - mass stars experience inevitably the planetary - nebula - nucleus ( pnn ) phase , providing a lot of high - energy photons ( e.g. , vassiliadis & wood 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the galaxies appear to be luminous emission - line galaxies during the pnn phase .",
    "we discuss how they look and compare our model results with observations of some interesting high - redshift galaxies .",
    "in many previous galaxy evolution models , it has been often assumed that stars are formed with a salpeter - like initial mass function ( imf ) in a galaxy ;    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the stellar mass in units of @xmath0 and @xmath29 is a normalization constant determined by the relation    @xmath30    which leads to    @xmath31    in this formulation , there are three free parameters ; the power index ( @xmath32 ) , and the upper and lower mass limits of the imf ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) . in order to describe the evolution of the solar neighborhood",
    ", one adopts conventionally @xmath32 = 1.35 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "however , it is highly uncertain whether or not this salpeter - like imf is applicable to the star formation history in primeval galaxies .",
    "ys86 investigated the imf for a hydrogen - helium gas cloud in detail based on the opacity - limited fragmentation theory .",
    "they found that typical masses of the first - generation stars are from several @xmath0 to 10 @xmath0 , depending on the assumed mass - luminosity relation for protostars derived by silk ( 1977c ) ; assuming that the opacity sources within the protostar is due to grains , he obtained the protostar luminosity    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "since this equation can not be applicable to the luminosity of stars with @xmath41 , ys86 treated @xmath42 as well as @xmath43 as free parameters in the ranges @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "then ys86 found that the mass at the peak of the imf is @xmath46 for @xmath40 and @xmath1 for @xmath47 .",
    "another important conclusion in ys86 is that stars more massive than these peaks are formed less efficiently than those expected from the salpeter imf with @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , stars less massive than these peaks are also formed less efficiently than those expected from the same salpeter imf ( see figure 3 in ys86 ) .",
    "therefore , the imfs derived by ys86 are significantly different from the salpeter imfs .",
    "we therefore adopt the imfs of ys86 and investigate luminosity and spectral evolution of galaxies for various sets of the parameters .    for convenience",
    ", we present a parametric form of the ys86 imf in the mass range between 1 @xmath0 and 60 @xmath0 for @xmath40 ( ys86a ) ,    @xmath49    and that for @xmath47 ( ys86b ) ,    @xmath50    here the above numerical coefficients are determined by the following normalization for each case ,    @xmath51    in figure 1 , we show the shapes of imf which we use in this paper .",
    "since the massive end slope of ys86a imf is steepest , the number of massive stars ( @xmath52 ) is smallest among the three , although the number of intermediate - mass star exceeds that of salpeter imf .",
    "prior going to investigating the luminosity and spectral evolution of galaxies using the ys86 imfs given in equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , we estimate how populous intermediate - mass stars are in the ys86 imfs with respect to those expected from usual salpeter - like imfs . since it is expected that the most spectacular effect of intermediate - mass enhanced star formation is brought by a number of luminous pnns with very high temperature @xmath53 k ( e.g. , vassiliadis & wood 1994 ) .",
    "since the mass of such high - temperature pnn progenitors lies in a range between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we estimate how many stars within this mass range are formed .",
    "if we adopt a salpeter imf , the number of stars with a mass range @xmath56 formed in the gas with 1 @xmath0 is estimated as    @xmath57    using @xmath29 given in equation ( 3 ) , we re - write equation ( 8) as    @xmath58    taking @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we obtain the numbers for the following two cases ; 1 ) @xmath32 = 1.35 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , and 2 ) @xmath32 = 1.35 , @xmath61 , and @xmath36 ( see table 1 ) .    if we adopt a ys86 imf , we can estimate the number of stars with a mass range @xmath62 by integrating equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) for @xmath47 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "we also show the number if all stars have a mass of 5 @xmath0 ; i.e. , the imf is described as a @xmath64 function with @xmath65 .    as shown in table 1 , the number of intermediate - mass stars with @xmath66 ",
    "@xmath55 for the ys86 imf with @xmath47 is nearly the same as that for the salpeter imf with @xmath61 .",
    "however , that for the ys86 imf with @xmath40 is larger by a factor of 2.4 than that for the salpeter imf with @xmath61 . for both cases , the ratio of the number of intermediate - mass stars with @xmath67 ",
    "@xmath68 for ys86 imfs to that for salpeter imf is within a factor of 3 . if stars with mass of @xmath55 are only formed , the number is larger by a factor of 15 than that for the salpeter imf with @xmath61 ( see section  3 ) .      in this section ,",
    "we show the evolution of bolometric luminosity , ionizing photon production rate , and emission line ratios of population iii star clusters with the ys86 imfs .",
    "we adopt the @xmath69 yr burst model as the star formation history .",
    "we calculate the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of star clusters by using the evolutionary population synthesis code pegase2 ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "although the code can be used to calculate the photometric evolution of galaxies being the effect of the chemical evolution into account , we calculate that of a single metallicity population with @xmath70 ; note that this metallicity is the poorest metallicity available in pegase2 .",
    "the duration of the starburst is longer than the lifetime of the most massive star in our model ( @xmath71 ) , @xmath72 yr ( girardi et al .",
    "since the lifetime is a half of the starburst duration , the metallicity of a half of stars formed in the starburst is @xmath6 .",
    "figure 2 shows the sed evolution for each model : salpeter imf ( solid lines ) , ys86a imf ( dotted lines ) and ys86b imf ( dashed lines ) .",
    "we show the seds at 0.01 gyr , 0.1 gyr and 0.5 gyr .",
    "note that the ordinate is the flux in units of erg s@xmath73 @xmath74 , corresponding to the case in which the total gas mass is @xmath75 .",
    "the seds are mainly determined by the upper main sequence stars and are not sensitive to the imf . during the starburst",
    ", the ionizing photons are radiated from massive main sequence stars whose effective temperature is lower than about 60,000 k ( girardi et al . 1996 ) .",
    "therefore there is a large break at 228  ; the photons with wavelength shorter than this are capable of ionizing the singly ionized helium . at an age of @xmath76 yr ,",
    "hottest stars in the star cluster are not main sequence stars but post - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars whose progenitors are stars with a degenerate carbon core , e.g. , intermediate - mass stars .",
    "the effective temperature of such post - agb stars ( i.e. , pnns ) is about 200,000 k ( blcker 1995 ) .",
    "therefore the break of 228    of such stars becomes to be small and thus the sed shape of far - uv is very hard .",
    "the global shape of sed depends slightly on the imf ( figure 3 ) . during a period of the starburst , between @xmath77 yr and @xmath78 yr",
    ", colors ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 ) become redder because of red supergiants . in this phase ,",
    "the star cluster with the salpeter imf is reddest and that with the ys86a is bluest .",
    "this is because the number ratio of red supergiants to upper main sequence stars is highest for the salpeter imf ( @xmath82 ) and lowest for the ys86a imf ( @xmath83 ) . on the other hand , for ages longer than @xmath84 yr",
    ", the star cluster with the salpeter imf is bluest and that with the ys86b is reddest .",
    "the reason for this is that the number ratio of redgiants to upper main sequence stars is lowest for the salpeter imf ( @xmath82 ) and highest for the ys86b imf ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the evolution of bolometric luminosity of a star cluster of @xmath75 for various imfs .",
    "the bolometric luminosity reaches its maximum at the end of starburst ( @xmath69 yr ) .",
    "the star cluster with the ys86b imf is brightest while that with the ys86a imf is faintest among the models .",
    "after that , following the death of massive stars , the bolometric luminosity of stellar systems decreases with time .",
    "the decreasing rate of the bolometric luminosity also depends on the functional form of imf .",
    "since the ys86a imf has a peak at @xmath86 whose lifetime is about 0.15 gyr , the decreasing rate of the bolometric luminosity is small till the time , and becomes large after that .",
    "since the lifetime of stars with @xmath75 is about 5.6 gyr , all the stars formed during the starburst have died till the time . as we show below",
    ", the dominant sources of the ionizing photons become the pnn at the age of @xmath87 0.1 gyr .",
    "the bolometric luminosity to mass ratios decrease from @xmath88 to @xmath89 during this period .    in the upper panel of figure 5",
    ", we show the evolution of production rate of photons capable of ionizing neutral hydrogen , @xmath90 , which is calculated by integrating the spectra below 912  , and that of photons capable of ionizing ionized helium , @xmath91 , which is calculated by integrating the spectra below 228  .",
    "first , we mention how the production rate of the hydrogen ionizing photons evolves . as the bolometric luminosity increases , the ionizing photon production rate reaches its maximum at the end of starburst , because the lifetime of early b stars of @xmath92 is longer than @xmath69 yr .",
    "the evolution of @xmath90 depends on imf . during the starburst ,",
    "the ionizing photon production rate per unit mass is largest for the star cluster with the ys86b imf but smallest for that with the ys86a imf . in our calculations",
    ", we adopt the mass of most massive stars @xmath93 whose lifetime is about @xmath72 yr .",
    "when the age of star clusters reaches the lifetime of the most massive stars , the number of hydrogen ionizing photons begins to decrease with time , following the death of stars radiating hydrogen ionizing photons .",
    "at the age of @xmath26 yr , the intermediate - mass stars evolve to pnns and they become dominant ionization sources for hydrogen . in the star cluster with the salpeter imf ,",
    "the number of pnns hardly changes and thus the production rate of ionizing photons is kept nearly constant . on the other hand , for the star cluster",
    "whose imf is either ys86a or ys86b , the number of pnns and the production rate of ionizing photons decrease with decreasing number of low mass stars . after the age of @xmath87 1 gyr ,",
    "the ionizing photon production rate is highest for the star cluster with the salpeter imf and smallest for that with the ys86b imf since it is proportional to the number of pnns .",
    "next , we comment on the evolution of the production rate of ionized helium ionizing photons .",
    "the lifetime of stars with @xmath94 is shorter than a few @xmath95 yr .",
    "after the massive stars have died , the remaining main sequence stars can not ionize the neutral helium . when the age of the star cluster become @xmath96 yr ,",
    "pnns come into existence .",
    "the effective temperature of pnns is very high enough to radiate he@xmath97 ionizing photons .",
    "the lower panel of figure  5 shows the evolution of the ratio of @xmath91 to @xmath90 which indicates the hardness of uv spectra . during the starburst ,",
    "the ratio is lower than @xmath98 .",
    "however , after pnns become the dominant source of uv radiation , the ratio exceeds @xmath98 .",
    "the stellar mass of a progenitor of pnn decreases with time .",
    "therefore , the effective temperature of pnn decreases and thus the ratio of @xmath91 to @xmath90 also decreases ( vassiliadis & wood 1994 ) .",
    "we investigate ultraviolet emission - line properties of the gaseous nebula photoionized by pnn clusters during the course of galaxy evolution .",
    "we use the photoionization code cloudy94 ( ferland 1997 ) , which solves the equations of statistical and thermal equilibrium and produces a self - consistent model of the run of temperature as a function of depth into the nebula .",
    "here we assume that a uniform density , dust - free gas cloud with plane - parallel geometry is ionized by various continuum sources . the parameters for the calculations are ( 1 ) the hydrogen density of the cloud , @xmath99 , ( 2 ) the ionization parameter , @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the number of ionizing photons , @xmath102 is the distance from the ionizing source , and @xmath103 is the speed of light ( osterbrock 1989 ) , ( 3 ) the sed of the ionizing radiation , and ( 4 ) the chemical composition .",
    "the sed of the ionizing radiation is derived as noted before using pegase2 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "we perform our photoionization calculations as a function of the ionization parameter between @xmath104 and @xmath105 with a logarithmic interval of 0.5 .",
    "we adopt @xmath106 .",
    "we also adopt a metallicity of @xmath107 .",
    "the calculations were stopped when the temperature fell to 3000 k , below which little optical emission is expected .    for reference , we also calculate agn photoionization models and shock - heating models in the following ways .",
    "a ) agn photoionization models are calculated by using cloudy94 .",
    "we adopt that the input sed has a power - law form with @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "b ) shock - heating models are taken from results of dopita & sutherland ( 1996 ) .",
    "their models assume solar metallicities , shock velocities from @xmath110 to @xmath111 , and the magnetic parameter @xmath112 .",
    "the pnn photoionization model results are shown together with these models in figure 6 ; the uv emission - line diagnostic diagrams proposed by de breuck et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "since high - energy photons supplied from the pnn clusters can cause high - ionization lines such as c iv , the uv emission - line properties of the pnn photoionization models are quite similar to those of the agn photoionization . in particular , the model locus predicted for @xmath69 yr - burst stellar populations with age of 0.5 gyr can not be distinguished from that for the agn models with a power - law continuum with @xmath108 .",
    "this similarity has been already utilized to show that some liners ( low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions : heckman 1980 ) can be explained by photoionization by pnn clusters ( taniguchi , shioya , & murayama 2000 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the shock - heating models appear to show different properties from those of the pnn and agn models .",
    "figure 7 shows the @xmath113 , ly@xmath114/he ii , and n v / he ii ratios as a function of @xmath115 for pnn models with age of 0.1 gyr ( open circles ) and 0.5 gyr ( filled circles ) .",
    "these ratios hardly depend on the imf but depend on the age .",
    "recently , the evolutionary tracks of zero - metal stars have been published ( e.g. , marigo et al .",
    "2001 ) . based on these new models ,",
    "schaerer ( 2002 ) demonstrated that massive population iii stars can radiate the he@xmath97 ionizing photons because of both the high effective temperature ( @xmath116 k ) of zero - metal stars and the effect of the non - lte stellar atmosphere ( see also tumlinson & shull 2000 ) .",
    "the small @xmath117 ratio during the starburst shown in fig.5 is attributed to the use of the population synthesis model with metallicity of @xmath70 instead that with @xmath118 .",
    "we note , however , h ii regions around massive population iii stars can not radiate metal lines in which we are interested since the gas around massive population iii stars is still primordial .",
    "if the star formation in some forming galaxies takes place with ys86 imf , such galaxies could experience a pnn - dominated phase @xmath26 yr after the initial starburst .",
    "therefore it seems important to look for such galaxies at high redshift .",
    "as is shown in section 2.3 , the sed of star clusters in pnn - dominated phase is so hard that the emission - line properties of the gaseous nebula photoionized by pnn clusters are indistinguishable from those photoionized by agn . considering the stellar evolution of intermediate mass stars ,",
    "the pnn phase follows the post - agb phase when stars eject a dusty gaseous envelope .",
    "it is therefore expected that the pnn cluster is surrounded by dusty gas ( see the next section ) . until the pnn - dominated phase begin , dust formed in the ejecta of type ii supernovae",
    "is also present in the interstellar medium ( todini & ferrara 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , a part of ionizing photons could be absorbed by such dust grains .",
    "however , we neglect this effect in the following discussion for simplicity .    the above expected features of the pnn star cluster",
    "are very interesting because the pnn star cluster may be observed as a dusty , ultraluminous infrared galaxy with high - ionization emission lines at high redshift .",
    "it is known that some high-@xmath119 forming galaxy candidates share nearly the same properties ; e.g. , iras f 10214@xmath1204724 at @xmath121 ( rowan - robinson et al . 1991 ) and smm 02399@xmath1220136 at @xmath123 ( ivison et al .",
    "their observed huge luminosities ( @xmath124 ) have been often considered to be powered by massive stars .",
    "however , high - ionization emission lines such as c iv @xmath1251549    and n v @xmath1251240    are also observed in them .",
    "since these emission lines can not be produced by photoionization by ordinary massive stars , it has been often considered that active galactic nuclei ( agns ) also reside in them ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 ; serjeant et al . 1998 ) .",
    "in particular , the presence of hidden broad emission lines reinforces this interpretation for iras f10214@xmath1204724 ( goodrich et al .",
    "spectropolarimetry of smm j02399@xmath1220136 reveals that the polarization behavior is similar to bal quasars ( vernet & cimatti 2001 ) . even in the local universe ,",
    "bursts of star formation ( starbursts ) are sometimes associated with galaxies hosting agns and thus the simultaneous presence of both starburst and agns may not be unusual ( e.g. , taniguchi 1999 ; mouri & taniguchi 2001 ; storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "however , the evidence for agns in them has been obtained often by rest - frame ultraviolet and optical emission lines which are subject to misunderstanding in some cases ( taniguchi et al .",
    "1999 ; lutz , veilluex , & genzel 1999 ) .",
    "since the effective temperatures of pnns exceed @xmath126 k , high energy photons are much more numerous than those from ordinary massive stars . here",
    "we examine whether or not the pnn cluster is responsible for the formation of high - ionization emission lines .    in figure 6 , we plot the observed positions of iras f10214 + 4714 ( serjeant et al . 1998 ) and the high-@xmath119 powerful radio galaxies studied by de breuck et al .",
    "although the high-@xmath119 powerful radio galaxies have an agn , at least some of them are considered to be very young galaxies ( e.g. , eales et al . 1993 ) .",
    "we also plot available data of planetary nebulae ( feibelman 2000 ) .",
    "it is found that the emission line ratios of iras f10214 + 4724 as well as the high-@xmath119 powerful radio galaxies in these uv diagnostics can be explained either by the agn models with @xmath127 or by the pnn model with an age of 0.5 gyr .",
    "the similar behaviors between the pnn and agn photoionization models unable us to distinguish the two models unfortunately .",
    "it is noted that both the agn and pnn models appear to underpredict the c ii]/c iii ratio as shown in the right - lower panel in figure 6 .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that the observed uv emission - line ratios of iras f10214 + 4714 and the high-@xmath119 powerful radio galaxies can be explained either by a combination between the shock heating and the agn photoionization or by a combination between the shock heating and the pnn photoionization .",
    "next , we study whether or not the star clusters dominated by pnns can explain the luminosity of high-@xmath119 forming galaxy candidates . as shown in section 2.2 the bolometric luminosity to mass ratio changes from @xmath128 to @xmath129 . therefore , the mass of stellar system needed to reproduce the bolometric luminosity of iras f10214 + 4724 ( @xmath130 ) , is @xmath131 .",
    "this value is comparable to the stellar mass of massive galaxies .",
    "it is impossible to radiate the huge luminosity from only pnns of first generation stars for this galaxy .",
    "there are two reasons why it is hard to explain the huge luminosity by a lot of pnns . as shown in section  2 , even for the ys86 s imf the number of intermediate - mass stars ( e.g. , @xmath132 ) is only a few time larger than that for the salpeter imf .",
    "the other reason is related to the difference of the lifetime of progenitor stars .",
    "the lifetime of stars with mass of @xmath133 is @xmath134 yr and that of @xmath68 is @xmath135 yr ( girardi et al . 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the mass range of stars which evolve to pnns at the same time is very small and as a result the number of those stars is very small . to solve this discrepancy",
    ", we consider an extreme model in the next section .",
    "here , we consider an extreme case that the formation of intermediate - mass stars occurs during a period of @xmath136 .",
    "most luminous forming galaxy candidates at high redshift contain a lot of molecular gas ( e.g. , @xmath137 ) and their inferred star formation rates ( sfr ) are of the order of @xmath138 yr@xmath73 ( frayer et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that a galaxy has a gas mass of @xmath139 and the initial star formation occurs at a rate of @xmath140 yr@xmath73 .",
    "we adopt a duration of the star formation @xmath141 yr . the gas mass converted to stars is estimated as @xmath142 .",
    "thus in this model , the star formation efficiency is @xmath143 10% .",
    "the star formation may take place in a central region ( say , within a radius of @xmath87 1 kpc ) of galaxies .",
    "we assume for simplicity that all stars formed in this initial star formation have a mass of 5 @xmath0 ( i.e. , a typical intermediate - mass star ) .",
    "therefore , the sfr adopted above means that 200 stars with @xmath65 are formed in a year ; @xmath144 stars yr@xmath73 .",
    "here we consider the evolution of a cluster of such stars .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of each star in the main sequence phase is @xmath145 and the age of the star is @xmath146 years .",
    "the total number of stars formed in the duration is @xmath147(total ) = @xmath148 stars .",
    "therefore , the total luminosity of the star cluster increases during the star formation period ( @xmath69 years ) at a rate of @xmath149 yr@xmath73 and reach the maximum bolometric luminosity @xmath150 at @xmath151 years .",
    "this maximum luminosity keeps as long as the stars are alive ; i.e. , up to @xmath152 years . shortly after this age",
    ", the stars evolve from the main sequence to pnns through agb .    since one pnn has a bolometric luminosity of @xmath153 ( e.g. , vassiliadis & wood 1994 ) , the total pnn luminosity amounts to @xmath154 where @xmath155 yr is the lifetime of the pnn phase .",
    "nevertheless this short lifetime , note that the pnn phase in the star cluster continues during nearly the same period as that of star formation ; i.e. , @xmath69 yr . in the pnn phase , the total luminosity of the star cluster is mostly dominated by unevolved main sequence stars while the ionizing photons are supplied mainly by pnns .",
    "another important property of the pnn phase is that a lot of gas is ejected from the stars .",
    "the core mass of each star is estimated to be @xmath156 .",
    "therefore , each star ejects a metal - enriched gas of @xmath157 .",
    "the total ejected gas mass amounts to @xmath158 . since the gas - to - dust mass ratio in such gas may be @xmath87 100 , the star cluster can produce a lot of dust grains with a mass of @xmath159 .    in summary ,",
    "the pnn phase of the star cluster has the following properties ; 1 ) the bolometric luminosity is @xmath160 ; 2 ) the ionizing luminosity is @xmath161 ; 3 ) the ionizing continuum is so hard that it creates highly - ionized regions around the star cluster ; 4 ) the dust mass is @xmath159 ; 5 ) the heavy element abundance is increased up to @xmath162 , and 6 ) this phase lasts for @xmath163 yr given that the duration of star formation is @xmath69 yr .      as shown in section 2.3 ,",
    "the pnn cluster is capable of the formation of the high - ionization lines such as c iv @xmath1251549 and c iii ] @xmath1251909 emission lines .",
    "for example , the observed c iv / he ii ratios are 5.7 and 1.9 for smm 02399@xmath1220136 and iras f10214@xmath1204724 , respectively ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 ; serjeant et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , our models can not explain the observed higher ratios of n v@xmath1251240/he ii ; 8.5 for smm 02399@xmath1220136 ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) and 1.4 for iras f10214@xmath1204724 ( serjeant et al . 1998 ) ( see figure 7 ) . in our model",
    ", we have assumed that each heavy element abundance is five percent of its solar value .",
    "if only the helium burning occurs in the core of pnn , carbon could be enriched .",
    "however , if the hydrogen burning also occurs , nitrogen could be enriched because nitrogen is formed as the end product of cno cycle in the core . if such nitrogen enrichment occurs , the observed strong n v emission may be explained .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the overabundance of nitrogen is also suggested for the broad emission - line gas in high-@xmath119 quasars ( hamann & ferland 1993 , 1999 ) .",
    "we consider the final fate of the star cluster in our model given in section 3.1 .",
    "the intermediate - mass stars formed in the initial starburst will evolve to white dwarf ( wd ) stars with a mass of @xmath164 through the phases of agb and planetary nebula .",
    "since the evolved wd stars have a luminosity of @xmath165 at their ages of @xmath166 yr , the star cluster formed in the starburst becomes finally very faint ; i.e , @xmath167 .",
    "since there is no such candidate in the local universe , it is expected that further star formation could have occurred in galaxies even if starbursts with only intermediate - mass stars occurred in the galaxies .",
    "after the death of pnn stars , dust grains with a mass of @xmath168 are left in a galaxy . since the galaxy has the gas with a mass of @xmath169 , the heavy element abundance increases at a level of @xmath170 after the pnn phase .",
    "therefore , so - called population ii stars would form in the gas clouds polluted chemically by the intermediate - mass stars . in other word",
    ", galaxies with a pnn cluster may evolve to ordinary galaxies observed in the present - day universe .",
    "what we would like to propose in this section is not that some particular high-@xmath119 dusty galaxies are indeed the pnn galaxies but that candidates of the _ extreme _ pnn galaxies share nearly the same properties of the observed high-@xmath119 dusty galaxies .",
    "recent deep surveys both at fir and submillimeter wavelengths have discovered a significant number of hyperluminous dusty galaxies at high redshift ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1991 ; kawara et al . 1998",
    "; puget et al . 1999 ; smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ; hughes et al . 1998 ; barger et al . 1998 ; eales et al . 1999",
    "; rowan - robinson 2000 ) .",
    "if some proto - galactic systems tend to form intermediate - mass stars preferentially as population iii stars , it is possible that candidates of the pnn galaxies may be found in some high-@xmath119 dusty galaxies .",
    "if present , such galaxies will be detected in future sensitive search for dusty galaxies made by atacama large millimeter array ( alma ; kurz & shaver 1999 ) .",
    "deep optical spectroscopy using new 30-m class telescopes will be also necessary to investigate detailed rest - frame uv spectra of such high-@xmath119 dusty galaxies",
