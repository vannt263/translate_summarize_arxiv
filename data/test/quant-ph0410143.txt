    "quantum computer ( qc ) can offer attractive ability in accelerating the computation . the most appealing feature from the classical computer , as feynman @xcite noted ,",
    "is that qc can be used to simulate the physical behavior of a real system .",
    "lloyd @xcite later confirmed this idea in a two - state array .",
    "recently , somaroo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented a general scheme for the quantum simulation with a physical system to simulate another . at present , among the physical realizations of qc , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )",
    "has shown the greatest achievements ( for a review see e.g. , @xcite ) though it uses the nuclear spin ensemble cory3,gershenfeld .",
    "with nmr technique , some interesting physical issues have been simulated successfully , including a four - level truncated quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite , a natural decoherence of a two - spin system @xcite , a two - qubit correlation function of the fano - anderson model @xcite , a three - spin effective hamiltonian @xcite , and the migration of excitation in an eight - state quantum system @xcite .",
    "quantum simulation utilizes a physical system , commonly referred to a qc , which is easier to control and measure , to simulate the dynamics of another one , which is rather a complex system , also called the simulated system .",
    "quantum simulation is expected to solve the problems in quantum many - body theory which is dealt with more difficult by the classical methods .",
    "the simulated system we will discuss is the bcs model @xcite which is of wide interest in condensed matter and gives a phenomenal explanation to superconductivity . in bcs model ,",
    "one of the key problem is to find the energy gap , _",
    "i.e. _ , the energy required at least to excite a quasiparticle from the fermi surface @xcite . in fact , some approximate methods @xcite have been proposed to calculate the energy gap for a given bcs hamiltonian . however , if we realize the quantum simulation , one can get the accurate result within a polynomial time and resources @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that qc can be used to simulate the property of a superconductor , such as the bcs model .",
    "based on a concrete scheme of quantum simulation on nmr qc which includes a method for choosing an appropriate working initial state and the usage of twice fourier transforms @xcite , we experimentally obtained the spectrum of the bcs hamiltonian , which coincided with the theoretic expectations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , authors had mentioned that the energy spectrum can be obtained by a fast fourier transform after the measurement . in this paper",
    ", we deepen this point and show how to implement the measurement of the spectrum on an nmr qc .",
    "for a complete quantum simulation procedure , there are three mainly qualitative steps  hamiltonian mapping , the experimental simulation , and again mapping back to the simulated system .",
    "we will obey these three steps to describe our quantum simulation scheme of the bcs model in the following .",
    "firstly , the mapping from the bcs hamiltonian to the pauli operators .",
    "_    the reduced hamiltonian of the bcs model is a pairing hamiltonian philip , lawu , xu ,    @xmath0 , \\label{bcs}\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 denotes the free electron energy from the fermi surface ; @xmath2 the coupling coefficient where it is simplified as a constant @xcite ; @xmath3 the electron number operators ; @xmath4 the fermionic creation ( annihilation ) operator ; @xmath5 represent all of relevant quantum numbers , and the electron pairs are labelled by the the quantum number @xmath6 and @xmath7 , according to the cooper pair situation where the paired electrons have equal energies but opposite momenta and spins : @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for a typical metal superconductor , @xmath10 ev , @xmath11 ev @xcite .",
    "our interested physical property of the bcs superconductor is the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ bcs ] ) , because an important parameter in superconductor  energy gap can be followed from it @xcite .",
    "the energy gap in superconductor is the energy difference between the ground state of the element excitation to its first excited state .",
    "a lot of analytical and numerical methods ( see @xcite for a review ) have been developed to obtain the energy gap through the diagonalization of the bcs hamiltonian .",
    "however , these methods are complicated and use some unproved approximations . in this paper , we show that the quantum simulation on a qc can solve it in a practical and direct way with reduced resources .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , authors had _ _",
    "_ _ mapped the hamiltonian ( [ bcs ] ) into the qubit space based on the isomorphic algebras of spin - fermion connection .",
    "the mapped hamiltonian is also known as the spin - analogy ,    @xmath12 ,   \\label{p}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 denote the pauli operators .",
    "_ secondly , experimental simulation .",
    "_    the details of the experimental simulation will be presented in the next section . here",
    "we emphasize two problems .",
    "one is how to choose a working initial state for the quantum simulation . in order to get the spectrum of @xmath14",
    ", one should select an appropriate initial state which can lead to a nonzero absorptive spectrum after the whole procedure of quantum simulation .",
    "note that it is nontrivial to find such a state . in a recent work  @xcite ,",
    "we proposed a general method of the selection of an initial state for @xmath15-qubit quantum simulation of bcs  model .",
    "this method guarantees the existence of the absorptive peaks in the @xmath14 spectrum and the correspondence between the peaks and the @xmath14 enengy levels is clearly known .",
    "the other problem is how to obtain the spectrum of a hamiltonian by quantum simulation on an nmr qc .",
    "we propose that the simulation scheme has to include twice fourier transforms ( @xmath16s )  the first @xmath16 is from temporal - domain to frequency - domain of the nmr free induction decay ( fid ) , and the second @xmath17 is of the nmr amplitudes of a peak .",
    "to validate this point , let us briefly review the procedure of the nmr measure ( the first @xmath16 ) .",
    "nmr internal hamiltonian in a lab frame is cory2    @xmath18    nmr measure process under such an internal hamiltonian is @xcite ,    @xmath19 ,   \\label{nmrmea}\\ ] ]    where we label the evolution time during the nmr measure as @xmath20 ; @xmath21 the nmr frequency - domain spectrum ; @xmath22 the state before the measurement , _",
    "i.e. _ , the state after a unitary evolution , which is , in our case , the evolution with @xmath14 ; @xmath23 the project operator , @xmath24 ; @xmath25 the trace operation ; @xmath16 the fourier transform applied for the nmr measured signal which is the function of nmr measure time @xmath20 .",
    "( [ nmrmea ] ) implies that after the nmr measure , the spectrum is just that of nmr hamiltonian self , but not the spectrum of the simulated hamiltonian . thus whatever the initial state or the evolution is , the spectrum is unchanged after the nmr measurement . from only nmr measure , we can not get the knowledge of the simulated hamiltonian .",
    "however , the amplitude in nmr spectrum includes the information of the @xmath14 evolution time .",
    "if we select a series of discrete @xmath14 evolution time , and measure the corresponding amplitudes of the each spectrum , then apply another @xmath16 on these amplitudes , the result will be the spectrum of the hamiltonian simulated .",
    "a more formal mathematic derivation for this procedure refers to @xcite .    from the above discussion , due to the characteristic of nmr measurement , twice fourier transforms are required to get the spectrum of the simulated hamiltonian when performing the quantum simulation .",
    "the first @xmath16 is the nmr measure applied for the nmr measure time , which obtains the nmr energy spectrum , and the second @xmath16 is applied for the simulated hamiltonian evolution time , which obtains the spectrum of @xmath14 .",
    "_ thirdly , mapping back to the simulated system . _    after the simulation , we are able to get the spectrum of @xmath14 .",
    "however , we have to remap it back into the bcs physical system and formulate the energy gap , which is the final aim of quantum simulation .",
    "in other words , we would like to know how the @xmath14 spectrum corresponds to the energy gap in bcs model .",
    "the derivation of the relationship between the eigenvalues of @xmath26 and the energy gap can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite by the diagonalization of the spin - analogy hamiltonian submatrices @xcite and numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "the energy gap is a function of eigenvalues corresponding to states @xmath27 and @xmath28 which span a subspace with one spin - up states , _",
    "i.e. _ , one cooper pair @xcite .",
    "thus , if we obtain the eigenvalues of the @xmath14 through the quantum simulation , the energy gap in bcs superconductor can be deduced .",
    "we performed the experiment on a bruker avance 400 mhz spectrumeter , keeping the temperature at 300k .",
