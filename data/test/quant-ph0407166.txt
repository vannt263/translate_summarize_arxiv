    "one of the most important features concerning quantum communication is the capacity or the fidelity of quantum information transmitted in noisy quantum channels @xcite .",
    "the key factor limiting the possibilities of communication using quantum states , is an environment - induced noise .",
    "uncontrolled interaction between the environment ( @xmath0 ) , and the transmitted quantum state can essentially affect the state and in consequence lower the communication capacity of the information channel @xcite .    for qubits , a well known class of quantum noisy channels consists of depolarizing channels @xcite .",
    "input information of such channels is stored in a density operator @xmath1 .",
    "such channels can be characterized by a probability @xmath2 that the quantum information is distorted , and with a probability @xmath3 that the information remains intact . in the simplest case of a single qubit transmitted through the noisy channel",
    "the influence of noise is usually decomposed into three interaction channels .",
    "bit error channel @xmath4 flipping the values of bits : @xmath5 flipping the phase : @xmath6 , @xmath7 ; and phase and bit error channel @xmath8 flipping both : @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the influence of these interaction channels can be written as an incoherent combination of three unbiased terms generating bit flip errors and phase flip errors in the form given by @xcite :    @xmath11    this depolarizing channel is just an example of a general quantum channel characterized by a trace - preserving , linear map @xmath12 .",
    "the influence of the environment on the quantum state @xmath13 can be represented in terms of a kraus decomposition : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 @xcite .    the unbiased depolarizing channel given by eq .",
    "( [ unbchannel ] ) , corresponds to @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is not difficult to derive the expression corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ unbchannel ] ) , from a unitary evolution involving an extended hilbert space @xmath20 , of the input qubit and an additional qubit ( @xmath0 ) , consisting the environment degree of freedom .",
    "although mathematically correct , such a derivation has no simple or direct physical realization in terms of a realistic noise .",
    "in fact in most known cases , the environment is much more complex , and the additional fact that the three interaction channels corresponding to bit error , flip error and phase error do not commute , leaves the incoherent addition of these channels in the formula ( [ unbchannel ] ) questionable .",
    "a more realistic approach to depolarization channels with bit errors requires a better understanding of the physics involved in the system - environment interactions .",
    "we shall assume that the system - environment interaction is characterized by a model hamiltonian @xmath21 .",
    "a unitary evolution of this combined system leads to a kraus decomposition described by a time dependent map @xmath22 .",
    "this means that one should have a time - dependent @xmath23 such that at the input time @xmath24 , @xmath25 . because of this the general property of the map : @xmath26 , expresses the continuity at the origin and hence for all time .    in general the problem of finding",
    "the evolution of the state interacting with the environment is very difficult , therefore the environment - induced noise is modelled using various simplified approaches including several assumptions such as the markov property . in such case",
    "it is assumed that the evolution of the state at a given instant is fully determined by the state at that instant , so the process has no  memory \" of its past .",
    "the markov property means the quantum channel is such that for an infinitesimal time interval : @xmath27 . in this case",
    "the channel map generates a completely positive dynamical semigroup : @xmath28 for @xmath29 , which defines a markovian dynamics .    as it is well known , for such markovian maps we can transform the time - dependent kraus decomposition ( [ unbchannel ] ) into a local lindblad equation @xcite    @xmath30    with the initial condition @xmath31 , and where the lindblad superoperator @xmath32 can be derived from the kraus operators .",
    "in this paper we present a simple model describing an evolution of a quantum state interacting with the environment and study various properties of the affected state . a physical picture behind the algebra can be for example a randomly fluctuating magnetic field acting on an electron s magnetic moment , or a thermally fluctuating birefringence of a single mode fiber transmitting a polarization state of a single photon .",
    "using our model we will justify the assumption ( [ unbchannel ] ) and determine the conditions for its validity .",
    "we will show that the disturbed output state has the form ( [ unbchannel ] ) in the infinite interaction time limit only if the disturbance is unbiased and acts identically in all bases . in the general case the evolution leads to a different final state .",
    "it will also turn out that the simple model leads to a nontrivial evolution not obeying the markov property . therefore",
    ", our simple approach will lead us out of the no - memory approximation regime .",
    "our model shows that in many cases one can not fairly neglect the memory effects of the interaction and consequently the markov property is not always valid @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] we present the model of a qubit in a presence of an external noise . in sec .",
    "[ sec - average ] we show that if the environment of the channel consists of zero - bandwidth noises one can calculate exactly expressions determining the evolution of a single qubit in such channel",
    "[ sec - examples ] contains several examples of zero - bandwidth noises that can affect the input state .",
    "we show that in general the decoherence channel can not be regarded as an incoherent superposition of independent interactions .",
    "special cases involving markovian and exactly soluble non - markovian dynamics are derived . in sec.[sec - fidelity ] the efficacy of the quantum channel is quantified by the fidelity between the output state and the input state .",
    "an appropriate measure for assessing the fidelity of a mixed input state is the entanglement fidelity @xcite , which is the maximum fidelity of states being purifications of the input mixed state @xmath33 and the output state @xmath34 .",
    "finally sec .",
    "[ sec - conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "the interaction of a qubit with an environment inducing random bit errors will be described by the following hamiltonian    @xmath35    where the three components @xmath36 will be uncontrolled `` noisy '' parameters characterizing the fluctuations of the environment .",

    "however our simple noise model can illustrate several properties of various completely positive maps .    in the proposed scenario ,",

    "the solution involves a stochastic averaging with respect to the environment . as a result",
    "it can be written in the following compact and formal form :    @xmath45    there is no useful formula that can handle the chronological time - ordering of three pauli matrices , and allows an exact stochastic averaging over the environment noises .",
    "there are however special cases when the exact solution of eq .",

    "all autocorrelations @xmath40 , become time - independent , the chronological product plays no role , and an exact averaging over the environment with arbitrary statistics can be performed .",

    "therefore , to model the evolution of the qubit under the influence of the environment - induced noise we will average the obtained output state over all possible realizations of the dynamics characterized by arbitrary vectors @xmath63 . for simplicity we will be interested in an averaged evolution of the qubit with an even in @xmath63 probability distribution @xmath64 . in this case a non - vanishing contribution to the averaged output state will come only from the symmetric part of the expression ( [ eq - output ] ) :    @xmath65.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the above formula it follows that the initial state ( [ initial ] ) evolves into an averaged output state    @xmath66    the dynamics of the output state is completely described at any time by a set of time - dependent functions @xmath67 , which have the following form :    @xmath68    the output state can be also equivalently represented in terms of kraus operators @xmath69 :    @xmath70    where @xcite :    @xmath71    these exact expressions for the kraus operators , are the main result of our investigations . before we discuss various statistical models",
    ", we note that an unbiased incoherent addition of bit - error channels in most cases is not justified .",
    "the formula above shows that the time - dependent @xmath67 functions couple in a highly nontrivial way the three channels . the simplified expression ( [ unbchannel ] ) , does not reflect this complicated entanglement between various bit - error channels .",
    "consider a simple case of a completely positive map determined by a lorentzian probability distribution    @xmath72    characterized by a width @xmath73 .",
    "the corresponding kraus operators ( [ eq - kraus ] ) in this case read    @xmath74    the resulting dynamics of such a channel is : @xmath75.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us note that this expression is equivalent to eq .",

    "we consider the following probability distribution :    @xmath82 \\delta(y)\\delta(z).\\ ] ]    in this case the kraus operators ( [ eq - kraus ] ) equal :    @xmath83    and the disturbed qubit at instant @xmath84 is in the state :    @xmath85    the periodic result is very straightforward , however it reveals something interesting . although our model is quite simple , it leads to non - trivial dynamics , which becomes apparent when we analyze the evolution of the density operator @xmath86 .",
    "one can easily find that the time - evolution is given by a non - local in time lindblad equation :    @xmath87.\\ ] ]    this shows that the time dynamics of @xmath88 at the given instant @xmath84 depends not only on the state at this instant , but also on the state at all earlier times .",
    "this behavior can be seen already from the form of the kraus operator , which for the infinitesimal time evolves as : @xmath89 and such an evolution characterizes non - markov processes with zero - bandwidth @xcite .    from this example",
    "we conclude that our model in general does not obey the  no - memory \" approximation and the evolution of the state is non - markovian .",
    "one could also think of studying multi - dimensional telegraphic noise , however in this case the analysis becomes much more complicated and there is no simple , linear integral kernel as the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq - telegrdynamics ] ) .",
    "although in general the expressions ( [ eq - kraus ] ) are not analytically integrable , one can find explicitly the kraus operators in the asymptotic steady - state limit @xmath90 . in this limit",

    "( [ eq - preskill ] ) .",
    "this result reproduces the steady - state markov limit justifying its validity .",
    "however it is valid only when the probability distribution @xmath97 is spherically symmetric i.e. , the three channels are unbiased . in general",
    "the input state evolves to a different limit .    in the figure [ fig - kraus ] we have shown the numerically calculated evolution of the kraus operator s coefficients for a gaussian probability distribution    @xmath98    for the following two cases : when the probability @xmath92 is spherically symmetric with @xmath99 ( upper plot ) and for the asymmetric distribution with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ( lower plot )",
    "it is seen that after some characteristic time , the state becomes stationary , however the limit depends on the characteristics of the probability distribution @xmath97 .",
    "the example discussed above provides an illustration of a unbiased and biased gaussian depolarization channels .",
    "in order to judge the quality of a communication channel and the role of the introduced noise one needs a tool to investigate the state disturbance during the transmission . to quantify the influence of the external noise onto the transmitted quantum state we use an entanglement fidelity measure defined as the following overlap between the input and output density matrix @xcite :    @xmath103    this fidelity is in general very difficult or impossible to calculate . for an arbitrary input state of a single qubit given by eq .",

    "the formula simplifies to @xmath108 . on the other hand",
    "it is not very surprising , that the maximally mixed state ( @xmath109 ) remains unchanged under the influence of the noise , while the communication fidelity decreases with increasing purity of the input state .",
    "using the same approach one may study also the evolution of multidimensional systems .",
    "of course the general expressions become very complicated , even when we consider a two - qubit hilbert space , however it is possible to find some compact solutions for special cases of pure states .",
    "consider an arbitrary two - qubit initial pure state :    @xmath110    using the same approach as above , one can calculate that for the independent disturbance of each mode with the same type of noise characterized by the spherically symmetric probability distribution @xmath92 the fidelity of the transformation is :    @xmath111    what is interesting in the above result is that the fidelity is the highest for separable states ( for example for @xmath112 and any @xmath113 ) and it drops down when the input state becomes more entangled .",

    "we find a not very surprising result , that the transformation fidelity is a decreasing function of the purity of the input state .",
    "for @xmath118 ( which of course does not yet correspond to the maximally mixed state ) the fidelity is the highest , while for the pure state ( @xmath119 ) the fidelity is the lowest .",
    "uncontrolled interaction between the environment and the transmitted quantum state can essentially affect the state and in consequence lower the communication capacity of an information channel .",
    "several ideas has been put forth to overcome this problem .",
    "one of the most promising is the use of so - called decoherence - free subspaces @xcite .",
    "this idea can be applied when the noise present in the system is correlated between consecutive uses of the communication channel @xcite , however this is not always possible and therefore one needs a careful study of the properties of various types of noise and their influence on the quantum state .    in this paper",
    "we have introduced a dynamical model of interaction between the quantum state and its environment and shown that although based on simple assumptions , it leads to non - trivial solutions . using the model we have analyzed properties of zero - bandwidth noise with lorentzian , telegraphic and gaussian distributions and have shown that only the first of them obeys the markov property , while the others exhibit memory effects and are non - markovian .",
    "our approach allowed us to solve a simplified version of a general problem when the noise is an arbitrary time - dependent stochastic process , whose solution is not known .",
