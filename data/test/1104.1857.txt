    "when the system is doped with holes away from half filling ( @xmath16 ) , the dynamics is no longer described by the heisenberg hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) , but one must use the @xmath36 hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) with the supplementary constraint of no double occupied lattice sites .",
    "it is easy to see that the motion of dilute holes in the antiferromagnetic nel background is strongly frustrate . indeed ,",
    "when a hole hops from one site to its nearest neighbor , a spin is also moved onto one lattice site with the wrong spin orientation with respect to the antiferromagnetic background . on the other hand ,",
    "a pair of holes with nearest - neighbor distance ( see fig .  [ fig-2 ] ) can move almost freely without destroying the antiferromagnetic background .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the propagation of the holes in the antiferromagnetic background can be written as  @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 are creation and annihilation operators for holes at the lattice site @xmath47 and the sum over the direction vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 is restricted to next - nearest neighbor lattice sites .",
    "note that in the effective hamiltonian @xmath50 we do not display the spin of the holes since the antiferromagnetic background forces the two holes to have antiparallel spins .",
    "in other words , the motion of a hole must not disturb the antiferromagnetic background .",
    "moreover , in this antiferromagnetic background approximation , it turns out that there is an effective attractive two - body potential between nearest - neighbor holes  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out  @xcite that the motion of a pair of holes , which naively should be mobile , is frustrated due to fermionic nature of the background spins .",
    "indeed , for states with two holes as nearest neighbors in an antiferromagnetic background it is easy to see  @xcite that there are configurations that differ by the exchange of two electrons .",
    "the destructive interference of these configurations leads to holes with very large effective mass .",
    "this problem can be avoided if we consider pairs of hole with distance much greater than the lattice spacing .",
    "accordingly , we shall suppose that two holes with distance @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the antiferromagnetic local order length scale , are subject to an effective attractive two - body potential .",
    "our proposal is quite similar to the spin - bag theory  @xcite where the pairing is due to a local reduction of the antiferromagnetic order ( bag ) shared by two holes .",
    "+ thus , we are lead to consider the following reduced interaction hamiltonian : @xmath53 the simplest choice for the two - body potential @xmath54 is : @xmath55 where the hard - core at the origin is imposed to avoid configurations where two holes are on the same site .",
    "moreover , since we are considering the limit of low carriers , @xmath56 , the hard - core potential does not allow two holes to come too close , thereby implementing the no - double occupation constraint . as concern the range of our potential @xmath57 , it is natural to choice @xmath57 of the order of the coherence length @xmath58 .",
    "so that we assume : @xmath59 the peculiar dependence on the doping fraction @xmath13 arises as follows .",
    "the attractive two - body potential originates from the interaction of two holes in the antiferromagnetic background which extends over a distance of order @xmath52 . since the injected holes tend to destruct the antiferromagnetic order , the area of the antiferromagnetic islands should decrease with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , as discussed in the introduction ( see fig .  [ fig-1 ] ) , the superconducting instability disappears at the maximal doping @xmath60 . the simplest parameterization which takes care of these effects leads to our eq .",

    "it is worthwhile to stress that the arguments developed in this section can not be considered as a truly microscopic derivation of the effective hamiltonian eq .",

    "for later convenience it is useful to think about the wave function of the superconducting ground state within the bcs theory .",

    "indeed , a bose - einstein condensate of pairs would also be given as a product of identical pair wavefunctions .",
    "the process of antisymmetrizing would not change the character of the state very much if the size of the pair wavefunction , @xmath78 , were small compared with the average spacing between pairs . in this case , wavefunctions in the sum differing by the exchange of single members of two or more pairs would not overlap very much , and the system would behave qualitatively like a condensed bose - einstein gas",

    "+ let us now discuss the optimal doped region @xmath200 . according to our picture ,",
    "the low - doping region is characterized by a large pseudogap @xmath120 which decreases rapidly with increasing doping , while the superconductivity is driven by the finite - temperature berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition with a critical temperature that increases with doping . on the other hand , in the overdoped region",
    "the superconducting transition is well described by the conventional weak - coupling d - wave bcs pairing in momentum space .",
    "the decrease of the critical temperature with increasing doping level originates from the underlying reduction in the pairing strength due to the disturbing of the antiferromagnetic correlations with overdoping . from our fig .",
    "[ fig-7 ] we see that the two critical temperatures meet in the optimal doped region @xmath200 , explaining in a natural way why the critical superconducting temperature reaches here the maximum value .",
    "since the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless temperature is comparable to the bcs critical temperature , this makes fluctuations much more important .",
    "even more , fig .",
    "[ fig-7 ] suggests that also the pseudogap temperature @xmath15 becomes comparable to both @xmath160 and @xmath199 .",
    "we conclude , thus , that in this region of the phase diagram there are competing phases and it is quite difficult to precisely pin down the underlying physics . on the other hand , as our fig .",
    "[ fig-7 ] is suggesting , there is a large body of evidence that pseudogap energy scale does not extend into the heavily overdoped region of the phase diagram , but rather collapse at a well defined critical concentration around @xmath364 .",
    "we would like to stress that the presence of an expanded phase - fluctuation regime in the optimal doped region may explain why certain spectroscopic probes , like angle - resolved photoemissions , tend to advocate scenarios in which the pseudogap temperature tracks the superconducting dome rather than vanishing inside it .",
    "the scenario advanced in this paper is supported by the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . by means of a systematic electronic raman scattering study of a mercury - based single layer cuprate as a function of doping level , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite revealed the existence of a breakpoint close to optimal doping , below which the antinodal gap ( the pseudogap ) is gradually disconnected from superconductivity .",
    "the nature of both the superconducting and normal state is distinctly different on each site of this breakpoint .",
    "this is consistent also with electronic specific heat measurements .",
    "in fact , it turns out that  @xcite in optimally and overdoped samples the sommerfeld coefficient is almost constant for @xmath365 , in accord with our eq .",
    "( [ 5.2 ] ) , while for underdoped samples there is considerable drop in the sommerfeld coefficient for @xmath366 ( see our eq .",
    "( [ 4.56 ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , there is evidence for carrier density which decreases smoothly from @xmath367 in the overdoped phase to @xmath368 in the underdoped phase .",
    "in fact , in refs .  @xcite it is shown that it exists a critical point @xmath204 where the pseudogap temperature @xmath15 goes to zero and which lies in the superconducting dome .",
    "just below @xmath204 there is a crossover from a metal with large hole - like fermi surface , consistent with @xmath369 , to a metal with low density of charge carrier , which from hall and seebeck effect measurements are quasielectrons , with @xmath316 .",
    "+ before concluding this section , we would like to remark that the optimal doped region of hole - doped cuprates is the most difficult to precisely characterize .",
    "in fact , according to our current theoretical understanding , in this region there is competition between the bcs gap and the pseudogap , and the presence of sizable phase fluctuations strongly limit our mean - field treatment . nevertheless , it is worthwhile to disciss the dependentce of the maximum critical temperature @xmath370 on the microscopic parameters of the model .",
    "as already discussed we have : @xmath371 now , from eqs .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) , ( [ 2.9 ] ) , ( [ 2.17 ] ) , ( [ 3.46 ] ) and ( [ 3.60 ] ) we obtain : @xmath372}\\ ] ] where we recall that @xmath204 is the hole doping fraction where the pseudogap @xmath373 vanishes .",
    "apparently eq .",
    "( [ 5.13 ] ) suggests that one can increase @xmath370 by increasing @xmath374 and/or decreasing @xmath204 .",
    "however , it turns out that the increase of @xmath374 leads also to an increase of @xmath204 and vice versa , such that the two effects compensate in eq .",
    "( [ 5.13 ] ) .",
    "this explains why the optimal hole doping fraction is very close to @xmath204 and attains the universal value : @xmath375 in the whole family of cuprates .",
    "the vast majority of high - temperature superconductors are hole - doped .",
    "nevertheless , in this section we will touch upon high - temperature electron - doped cuprates ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the most evident difference between electron and hole doped cuprates is that the antiferromagnetic phase at @xmath376 is much more robust in the electron - doped material and it persists to much higher doping levels . if we adopt the effective single - band hubbard model of sect .",
    "[ 1 ] for the microscopic description of the @xmath1 layers , then we see that the electrons injected into the copper - oxide plane would behave like the holes in the overdoped region of the hole - doped cuprates .",
    "however , due to the stronger antiferromagnetic correlations in the ground state for @xmath16 , the electron carrier density is : @xmath377 since one electron of the @xmath378 electrons per cu atom is frozen in the half - filled hubbard band antiferromagnetic configuration . in our approach the effective hamiltonian for the injected electrons should be given by eqs .",
    "( [ 2.18 ] ) and ( [ 2.6 ] ) . in particular ,",
    "the electron effective mass agrees with eq .",
    "( [ 2.17 ] ) : @xmath379 with the previously stated values of the model parameters . however , due to the increased role played by the fermion correlations in the antiferromagnetic background , we expect that the effective two - body potential in the interaction hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) is reduced to some extent . to take into account this effect",
    ", we shall assume that the effective potential @xmath380 has the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) but with a somewhat reduced interaction length : @xmath381 we now show that this small variation in the range of the effective two - body interaction potential leads to a dramatic change in the phase diagram of the electron - doped cuprates .",
    "in fact , by solving the real - space d - wave bound state schrdinger equation eq .",
    "( [ 3.11 ] ) we find a drastically reduced pseudogap ( see fig .  [ fig-13 ] ) : @xmath382     the pseudogap and bcs critical temperatures ( in kelvin ) versus the doping fraction for the electron - doped cuprates .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    this means that , according to the discussion in sect .",
    "[ 3 - 2 ] , the pseudogap superconducting phase of the underdoped region of hole - doped cuprates is absent .",
    "therefore , the superconducting transition in electron - doped cuprates is driven by the weak - coupling d - wave bcs pairing in momentum space . in this case",
    "the critical bcs temperature is given by eq .",
    "( [ 3.62 ] ) : @xmath383}\\ ] ] with @xmath384 given by eq .  (",
    "[ 6.4 ] ) , @xmath385 ^ 2 \\ ; , \\ ] ] and @xmath386 the bcs critical temperature eq .",
    "( [ 6.5 ] ) as a function of the electron doping level is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig-13 ] . from the schematic phase diagram",
    "we infer that the maximal critical temperature is strongly reduced with respect to the hole - doped cuprates .",
    "moreover , the superconducting phase manifests itself in a rather narrow interval of doping around @xmath387 .",
    "these general aspects of our phase diagram seem to be in qualitative agreement with observations .",
    "however , a thorough understanding of the superconductivity in electron doped cuprates must await more detailed experimental informations .",
    "the driving principle of the approach presented in this paper has been that the high - temperature superconductivity can be understood within some framework along the line of the microscopic theory of bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer .",
    "the results presented in this paper summarize our attempts over the last years to construct a comprehensive model that gives all aspects of the unusual behavior seen in the various regions of the phase diagram of the cuprates .",
    "it is obvious that we must rely heavily on some assumptions .",
    "first , we assumed that the physics of the high - temperature cuprates is deeply rooted in the copper - oxide planes .",
    "this allowed us to completely neglect the motion along the direction perpendicular to the @xmath1 planes .",
    "our second main assumption has been that the single - band effective hubbard model is sufficient to account for all the essential physics of the copper - oxide planes .",
    "both assumptions are well accepted and superbly illustrated in the anderson s book  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we have proposed an effective hamiltonian that is able to govern the dynamics of the electrons or holes injected into the undoped copper - oxide planes .",
    "we arrived at our effective hamiltonian by using arguments well - known in the literature on the motion of charge carriers in an antiferromagnetic background .",
    "notwithstanding , we were unable to offer a truly microscopic derivation of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "so that our arguments to determine the effective hamiltonian , albeit suggestive , can not be considered a first principle derivation . in spite of that , we showed that the effective hamiltonian offers us a consistent picture of the high transition temperature cuprate superconductors . due to the reduced dimensionality the two - body attractive",
    "potential admits real - space d - wave bound states . the binding energy of these bound states , which plays the role of the pseudogap , decreases with increasing doping until it vanishes at a certain critical doping @xmath166 .",
    "this allows us to reach the conclusion that the key features of the underdoped side of the phase diagram are controlled by very strong pairing that is phase - disordered by thermal fluctuations .",
    "we also were able to estimate the upper critical magnetic field whose strength and doping dependence are in good agreement with observations .",
    "we obtain a clear explanation for the so - called vortex region and for the puzzling discrete states bounded to the core of isolated vortices .",
    "we have discussed how the presence of the pseudogap is responsible for the formation of the quasielectron nodal fermi liquid which , in turn , leads to the fermi arcs observed in angle - resolved photoemission studies and to the fermi pockets in quantum oscillation experiments .",
    "we have found a natural explanation for the peculiar dependence of the specific heat on the applied magnetic field observed in underdoped cuprates .",
    "however , we would like to stress that we did not attempt a complete discussion of the strange behavior of the cuprates in this region . in particular , as already pointed out in sect .",
    "[ 4 ] , we did not discuss the so - called nodal gap .",
    "in fact , we plan to present in a separate paper a detailed discussion on the origin and temperature dependence of the nodal gap , on the thermal conductivity , on the departure from the wiedemann - franz law and on the london penetration depth .",
    "+ in our model the overdoped region is realized for hole doping in excess of the critical doping @xmath204 where the pseudogap vanishes . in this region",
    "the conventional d - wave bcs framework account for many of the low - energy and low - temperature properties of the copper oxides , in agreement with several observations . finally , we explain naturally why the superconducting critical temperature reaches its maximum in the optimal doped region .",
    "we pointed out that in this region the competition between the pseudogap and the d - wave bcs gap together with the enhanced role of the phase fluctuations makes questionable the usually adopted mean - field approximation .",
    "we have also briefly discussed the comparatively less - studied electron - doped cuprates .",
    "we suggest that the dome - shaped superconducting region in electron - doped copper - oxides can be described by the conventional weak - coupling d - wave pairing in momentum space . + in conclusion , the fact that a relatively simple model for the effective hamiltonian allowed to recover several observational features of the high - temperature copper oxides , suggests that the approach presented in this paper could be considered a significative step toward a microscopic explanation of the high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates .",
