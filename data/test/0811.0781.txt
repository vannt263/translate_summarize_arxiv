    "it follows that crowding affects the dse to a greater extent than the folded state .",
    "although the precise theoretical predictions of the power law change in @xmath17 as @xmath13 changes have not been verified , several experiments using a number of proteins have confirmed that indeed @xmath18 increases with @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "the importance of such overlaps , for soft - spheres , increases as the crowders become much larger than the protein beads , and the neglect of such overlaps is the reason for the quantitative inaccuracy . as the size of the crowders increases ( i.e. , as the thickness of the depletion layer surrounding the protein beads increases ) , the surface enclosing ub becomes more spherical , loses detail , and undoubtedly changes less in response to changes in the conformation of the molecule . since depletion forces are proportional to the change in @xmath156(ub ) with respect to changes in ub conformation , eq .

    "the quantitative accuracy of the ao theory for unfolding in the presence of crowders of diameter @xmath158 nm is likely to increase , because the volume excluded to the crowders will change significantly with changes in the conformation of the polyprotein .      from arguments based on volume exclusion that lead to crowding - induced entropic stabilization of the folded structures , it follows that crowding effects should be more dramatic on poly ub than the monomer . in order to illustrate the effect of crowding on stretching of ( ub)@xmath0 we chose @xmath61 nm , which had negligible effect on @xmath2 for the monomer .",
    "however , we found significant influence of the large crowding particles when ( ub)@xmath0 was forced to unfold in their presence .",

    "the frequency with which the @xmath163 possible permutations of these orders at @xmath36 and at @xmath35 were observed is presented in table [ tbl : moduleorderfrequencies ] .",
    "it is clear that at both @xmath36 and at @xmath35 , the most probably order of events was @xmath164 . at @xmath36",
    "this order was only marginally more probable than the order @xmath165 , while at @xmath35 @xmath164 became overwhelmingly more probable than any other unfolding order .",
    "in none of the simulations at @xmath36 or @xmath35 , did the rupture of module @xmath160 occur as the final event .",
    "_ unfolding within a module depended on proximity to the point of force application : _ at @xmath166 , @xmath37 is fairly brittle , and the rupture of contacts within a module occured nearly simultaneously . nevertheless , by carefully examining time - dependent contact maps such as those illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:20 ] , we were able to determine ( 1 ) at both @xmath36 and @xmath35 , @xmath167 contacts were the first to rupture , and ( 2 ) only for module @xmath160 was this rupture event _ invariably _ followed by the loss of @xmath168 contacts .",
    "when other modules ruptured , loss of @xmath167 contacts was occasionally followed by loss of the @xmath169 strand - pair contacts .",

    "@xmath7 _ to rupture at _ @xmath35 : figure [ fig:21]*a * illustrates the time dependence of @xmath170 at @xmath36 and at @xmath35 .",
    "interestingly , the plot reveals that after the second rupture event , the @xmath171 increased more rapidly in the presence of crowders than in their absence .",
    "this is likely a reflection of the fact that at @xmath3 modules @xmath159 and @xmath160 were the first two modules to unfold in 44% of the trajectories , while at @xmath35 these two modules were the first to unfold in only 19% of trajectories .",
    "thus , @xmath171 increased more rapidly in the presence of crowders , because the @xmath7 of @xmath37 with two adjacent modules unfolded is larger than that with two unfolded but non - adjacent modules . interestingly , these differences are masked in the time - dependent increase of the end - to - end distance ( fig .",
    "[ fig:21]*b * ) .",
    "figure [ fig:21]*a * also reveals that the horizontal inflection points marking the third unfolding event occur at different times at @xmath172 and in the absence of crowders .",
    "the difference between these two times was responsible for the difference in average unfolding forces of @xmath173 pn illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] .",
    "thus , it is clear that despite the highly non - equilibrium nature of this pulling experiment , depletion effects were substantial and it required a much greater force to reach @xmath111 in the presence of these crowders than in their absence .",
    "we predict that systematic experiments will reveal that polyub molecules composed of larger numbers of modules will show greater increases in @xmath24 relative to @xmath174 than polyub molecules composed of fewer repeats .",
    "the size of these differences should increase with decreasing loading rate .",
    "finally , it may even be possible to observe differences in the @xmath133 as a function of unfolding event number ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] ) .",
    "the increase in @xmath24 , at a fixed @xmath13 , for poly ub is likely to be even more significant for small crowding agents as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:6 ] ) ( see below for further discussion ) .",
    "general theory , based on the concept of depletion effects ( see eqs .  ( [ eqn:8 ] ) and ( [ eqn:6 ] ) ) , shows that crowding should enhance the stability of proteins , and hence should result in higher forces to unfold proteins .",
    "however , predicting the precise values of @xmath24 is difficult because of the interplay of a number of factors such as the size of the crowding agents and the number of amino acid residues in the protein . despite the complexity",
    "a few qualitative conclusions can be obtained based on the observation that , when only excluded volume interactions are relevant , then the protein or polyprotein would prefer to be localized in a region devoid of crowding particles @xcite .",
    "the size of such a region @xmath175 .",
    "if @xmath176 then the crowding would have negligible effect on the unfolding forces .",
    "the condition @xmath176 can be realized by using large crowding particles at a fixed @xmath1 . in the unfolded state ,",
    "@xmath177 nm @xcite which for ub leads to @xmath178 nm .",
    "thus , @xmath179 . these considerations suggest that the crowder with @xmath158 nm would have negligible effect on the unfolding force , which is in accord with the simulations .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath180 when @xmath181 nm , and hence we expect that the smaller crowders would have measurable effect on the unfolding forces",

    "we expect that for the smaller crowding agent @xmath2 would scale with @xmath1 in a manner given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn:6 ] ) . in general ,",
    "appreciable effect of crowding on the unfolding forces can be observed only for large proteins or for polyproteins using relatively small crowding agents .",
    "although we have only carried out simulations for ub and ( ub)@xmath0 at one non - zero @xmath13 , theoretical arguments can be used to predict the changes in @xmath24 as @xmath13 increases .",
    "the expected changes in the force required to unfold a protein can be obtained using a generalization of the arguments of cheung et al.@xcite in the presence of crowding agents the protein is localized in a region that is largely devoid of the crowding particles @xcite .",
    "the most probable size of the region is @xmath182 where @xmath4 is the size of the crowding agent .",
    "if the structures in the dse are treated as a polymer with no residual structure then the increase in entropy of the dse upon confinement is @xmath183 where @xmath7 is the dimension of the unfolded state of the protein .",
    "if native state stabilization is solely due to the entropic stabilization mechanism we expect : @xmath184 where @xmath22 is the critical force for unfolding the protein , @xmath185 is the gain in contour length at the unfolding transition , and @xmath186 relates @xmath7 to the number of amino acids through the relation @xmath187 ( @xmath188 varies between 2 - 4  ) .",
    "a few comments regarding eq .",
    "( [ eqn:6 ] ) are in order .",
    "( 1 ) the @xmath13 dependence in eq . ( [ eqn:6 ] )",
    "does not depend on the nature of the most probable region that is free of crowding particles .",
    "as long as the confining region , which approximately mimics the excluded volume effects of the macromolecule , is characterized by a single length d , we expect eq .",
    "( [ eqn:6 ] ) to be valid .",
    "( 2 ) the additional assumption used in eq . ( [ eqn:6 ] )",
    "is that @xmath189 , and hence there may be deviations due to finite size effects .",
    "( 3 ) the equivalence between crowding and confinement breaks down at large @xmath13 values .",
    "consequently , we do not expect eq .",
    "( [ eqn:6 ] ) to fit the experimental data at all values of @xmath13 .",
    "( 4 ) it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eqn:6 ] ) that , for a given @xmath7 , small crowding agents are more effective in stabilizing proteins than large ones .",
    "thus , the prediction based on eq .  [ eqn:6 ] is supported by our simulations . ( 5 ) from the variation of @xmath24 with @xmath13 ping et al .",
    "@xcite suggest that @xmath190 .",
    "however , the large errors in the measurements can not rule out the theoretical prediction in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:6 ] ) .",
    "we have successfully fit their experimental results using eq .",
    "( [ eqn:6 ] ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig:21]*c * ) .",
    "additional quantitative experiments are required to validate the theoretical prediction .",
    "it is difficult to map the concentrations in g / l used in the study of ping et al .",
    "@xcite to an effective volume fraction because of uncertainties in the molecular weight of dextran used in the study .",
    "hence , a quantitative comparison between theory and experiments is challenging .",
    "a naive estimate may be obtained using the values reported by weiss et al .",
    "given that the dextran used in the study is thought to have an average molecular weight of 40 kda and an estimated average hydrodynamic radius of 3.5 nm @xcite , we find that @xmath191",
    "g / l corresponds to a volume fraction @xmath192 , which is very large .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath13 must be large when @xmath191",
    "alternatively , we estimated @xmath193 for dextran using @xmath194 where @xmath152 is the number of monomers in a 40 kda dextran is @xmath195 .",
    "if the monomer size @xmath196 nm , then we find @xmath197 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath191",
    "g / l corresponds to @xmath198 and that @xmath199 ( eq .  ( [ eqn:6 ] ) ) , then at @xmath35 we would expect a nearly 18@xmath25 increase in @xmath133 . similarly , if @xmath191 g",
    "/ l corresponds to @xmath200 then we would expect an increase in @xmath133 of approximately 21@xmath25 . in any case",
    ", we can say that at physiologically relevant volume fractions ( @xmath13 @xmath201 [ 0.1,0.3 ] ) , the percent increase in @xmath133 is likely to be @xmath202 .",
    "our simulations for @xmath203 nm predict an increase of 3 - 4% , which shows that a more detailed analysis is required to obtain an accurate value of @xmath4 for dextran before a quantitative comparison with experiments can be made .",
    "the larger increase seen in experiments may also be a reflection of the use of ( ub)@xmath157 rather than a monomer .",
    "regardless of the crowder size we find that the unfolding pathways are altered in the presence of crowding agents .",
    "it is normally assumed that the rupture of secondary structure elements is irreversible if the applied force exceeds a threshold value . however , when unfolding experiments are carried out in the presence of crowding particles , that effectively localize the protein in a smaller region than when @xmath36 , reassociation between already ruptured secondary structures is facilitated as shown here .",
    "thus , forced - unfolding can not be described using one dimensional free energy profiles with @xmath116 as the reaction coordinate @xcite .",
    "we find that the average unfolding force for the final rupture event of the unfolding of @xmath37 occurred at much larger values in the presence of crowders than in their absence . with @xmath61 nm , which has practically no effect on the unfolding force of the monomer , and @xmath35",
    "even with unfolding of two modules the interactions between the stretched modules and protein are small ( @xmath204 ) . only upon unfolding of the third ub",
    "do crowding effects become relevant , which leads to an increase in @xmath24 .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath205 should increase with the number of modules in the array and that it may be possible to detect differences in @xmath133 which are conditional on the unfolding event number .",
    "we speculate that naturally occurring polyproteins that are subject to mechanical stress have evolved to take advantage of precisely such enhanced depletion effects .",
