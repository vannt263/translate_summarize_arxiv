    "many communication protocols implicitly require that the communicating parties share a reference frame  @xcite .",
    "for instance , if one party , alice , transmits qubits to another party , bob , using spin-1/2 particles , the quantum state of the collection can only be recovered by bob if he and alice share a reference frame for orientation .",
    "lacking such a shared reference frame ( for instance , by lacking knowledge of the relation between their local reference frames ) is equivalent to having a noisy channel ; the density operator relative to bob s local frame is the average over rotations of the density operator relative to alice s local frame . for a single qubit , such an average over rotations yields complete decoherence  no information about the quantum state survives",
    "nonetheless , alice and bob can still achieve perfect classical and quantum communication by encoding the information into the rotationally - invariant degrees of freedom of many qubits  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the limit of large numbers , the cost of not sharing a reference frame is only logarithmic in the number of systems .",
    "similarly , if alice and bob lack a phase reference , they can still encode classical and quantum information in phase - invariant states of composite systems  @xcite .",
    "however , such communication schemes are technically challenging to implement because they make use of highly entangled states of many qubits  @xcite .",
    "such schemes will be referred to here as `` calibration - free '' .",
    "a more straightforward strategy for coping with the lack of a shared reference frame is for alice and bob to begin their communication protocol by setting up a shared reference frame , that is , they begin by calibrating or aligning their local reference frames . thereafter alice transmits her quantum systems normally .",
    "this strategy is illustrated in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "the problem of aligning reference frames using finite communication resources has been well studied  @xcite .",
    "if only finite communication resources are devoted to the task , then the token of alice s reference frame that is transmitted to bob will be of bounded size .",
    "assuming the reference frame in question is associated with a continuous degree of freedom , this bound leads to a nonzero probability of error in the decoding of messages .",
    "nonetheless , this scheme has two advantages over its calibration - free counterpart : ( i ) alice does not need to implement any entangling operations to encode classical bits or logical qubits into the physical qubits , nor does bob require such operations to decode ( they may require entangling operations to prepare and measure the reference frame token , but the preparation and measurement they require is always the same and their effort does not scale with the size of the message ) ; ( ii ) if alice wishes to communicate a classical bit string or a string of logical qubit states , she can encode one logical bit or qubit per physical qubit , and bob can decode one logical bit or qubit per physical qubit ( in other words , the blocks of physical qubits into which they encode and decode their logical bits and qubits can be as small as one , unlike the calibration - free scheme ) . by virtue of ( ii ) , alice does not need to know the entire message string at the outset to achieve her optimal communication rate , nor does bob need to store all of the systems coherently until he has received the entire sequence of physical qubits , whereas such capabilities are required to achieve the optimal rate of communication in the calibration - free scheme .",
    "we are therefore motivated to explore how well alice can communicate quantum information to bob after supplying him with a bounded - size token of her reference frame .     by the state @xmath0 and the system",
    "@xmath1 by the state @xmath2 .",
    "bob , who is not correlated with alice s reference frame , describes the joint state of @xmath3 and @xmath1 as the twirling of alice s description , namely @xmath4 .",
    "b ) we can consider alice s act of adjoining the reference frame token to the system together with the twirling as an encoding operation @xmath5 . composing this with bob s decoding operation @xmath3",
    ", the resulting channel can be described as an effective @xmath6.,width=302 ]    the general case we consider is that of a reference frame associated with a compact lie group @xmath7 .",
    "if the system is prepared in the state @xmath2 and the reference frame token in the state @xmath8 relative to alice s local reference frame , then relative to bob s local reference frame , the pair is in the state @xmath9 = \\mathcal{g } ( |e\\rangle \\langle e| \\otimes \\rho ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 averages over the collective action of the group and is termed the @xmath7-twirling operation ( see figure  [ fig : figure1 ] ) .",
    "this state encodes @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the case where the reference frame token is prepared in a particular state @xmath8 , suggested by previous investigations  @xcite , which is near - optimal for transmitting information about the group element and which makes the mathematics particularly simple .",
    "we then determine how well bob can reconstruct the state @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that the recovery ( or decoding ) operation @xmath11 that is equal to the hilbert - schmidt adjoint of @xmath5 , normalized to be trace - preserving , is provably near - optimal ( in a sense we will define later ) . the composition of encoding and decoding yields an effective decoherence of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a probability distribution over the group with @xmath14 the group - invariant measure , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are unitary representations of @xmath7 on the system @xmath1 and the reference frame token @xmath3 respectively . with our particular choice of reference state @xmath8 , we find that @xmath17 for all @xmath18 , ensuring that @xmath19 is a @xmath7-invariant map ( it commutes with the action of every @xmath20 ) .",
    "the figure of merit relative to which the decoding operation is judged to be near - optimal is the entanglement fidelity .",
    "we also demonstrate two distinct ways of implementing this decoding operation .",
    "the first is an obvious scheme : bob estimates the orientation of the token relative to his local frame and then re - orients the system appropriately .",
    "we call this the `` measure and re - orient '' scheme .",
    "the second is less intuitive , but reveals more about the structure of the problem : bob projects into the virtual subsystems that support the representation of the group induced by _ relative _ transformations of the system and token and implements an isometry that maps these onto a single hilbert space .",
    "we call this the `` extract from the relational subsystems '' scheme .",
    "these relational subsystems are the places in the hilbert space of the combined token and system where the quantum information associated with @xmath2 is to be found .",
    "their characterization is the key technical result of the article .",
    "the second scheme is also particularly interesting because , with a slight modification , it can yield a decoding that is probabilistically perfect , that is , one which sometimes fails but which yields a perfect decoding when it succeeds .",
    "we work out the explicit form of the recovery operation @xmath11 and the effective decoherence @xmath19 for several interesting examples : ( i ) a phase reference ; ( ii ) a cartesian frame ( representing an orthogonal triad of spatial directions ) ; ( iii ) a reference direction ( representing a single spatial direction ) . in each case",
    ", we consider a system consisting of a single qubit .",
    "the explicit form of the decoherence map is actually quite simple in this case .",
    "because @xmath19 is a @xmath7-invariant map , it follows from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite that it is a sum of irreducible @xmath7-invariant maps called moments .",
    "but in the case of a qubit , there is only a single nontrivial moment",
    " the @xmath7-twirling map @xmath10 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the identity map .",
    "we show that for our examples , @xmath23 is inversely proportional to the size of the reference frame token , @xmath24 where the size of the reference frame is given by the quantum number of the highest irreducible representation appearing in the state of the token .",
    "it is also shown that in probabilistically perfect decoding schemes , the probability of failure is inversely proportional to the size of the reference frame token .",
    "these results are specific to the special form of reference frame state that we consider here .",
    "the idea that bounded - size quantum reference frames induce an effective decoherence is not new .",
    "the effect of a bounded - size clock , which is a kind of phase reference , has been considered previously by many authors @xcite and that of a bounded - size directional frame has been considered by poulin  @xcite .",
    "our results go beyond this work in several ways .",
    "for one , the case of a cartesian frame , which is particularly significant given that it is representative of the general non - abelian case , has not been examined before .",
    "more significantly , we consider many different sorts of reference frames within a unified framework and we provide insight into the structure of the problem .",
    "it should be noted that although our method can be applied to a system of arbitrary dimension , we here obtain explicit expressions for the effective decoherence only in the case of the simplest possible system : a qubit .",
    "we hope to provide a discussion of the foundational implications of modeling bounded - size reference frames by effective decoherence in a subsequent paper .    finally , it is worth pointing out that the problem of communication in the presence of a bounded - size reference frame has interesting connections with a disparate set of topics in quantum information theory and the theory of quantum reference frames : _ partially correlated reference frames .",
    "_ when some information is known about the relative orientation of alice and bob s local reference frames , they are said to share partially correlated reference frames .",
    "this is a resource that interpolates between having and lacking a shared reference frame .",
    "its quality can be characterized by the probability distribution over the relative orientation  the more peaked the distribution , the better the correlation .",
    "what can be achieved with this resource is an interesting question that has only begun to be addressed .",
    "we gain some insight into the question in this article because the `` measure and re - orient '' implementation of the recovery operation begins with a reference frame alignment protocol  @xcite that leaves alice and bob holding partially correlated reference frames .",
    "_ programmable operations .",
    "_ there have been many investigations into the possibility of encoding an operation into a quantum state such that the state can subsequently be used to implement the operation on another system .",
    "if the system into which the operation is encoded is bounded in size , then it is known that one can only achieve an approximate version of the operation or a perfect version with non - unit probability  @xcite .",
    "the token of the quantum reference frame in our communication protocol is an instance of a program that encodes the unitary that relates alice s local reference frame to bob s .",
    "bob subsequently uses it to implement the inverse of this unitary on the system .",
    "our results therefore provide interesting examples of both approximate and unambiguous programmable operations . _",
    "measures of the quality of a quantum reference frame .",
    "_ our results also contribute to the project of quantifying the extent to which a quantum reference frame of bounded size can stand in for one of unbounded size  @xcite , an important element of a resource theory of quantum reference frames .",
    "for instance , a measure of the strength of the effective decoherence associated with the bounded - size reference frame may serve as an operational measure of its quality .    _ private channels .",
    "_ if no party besides bob has a sample of alice s rf , then alice and bob are said to possess a _ private _ shared reference frame .",
    "these have been shown to constitute a novel kind of key that is useful for private communication schemes  @xcite .",
    "our results establish a lower bound on the fidelity between input and output in private communication schemes that rely on bob possessing a bounded - size token of alice s reference frame .",
    "they also establish a bound on the probability of achieving perfect fidelity by post - selection .",
    "this cryptographic application provides a particularly useful perspective on bob s recovery operation : the message is encoded in the relative orientation between the system and the token of alice s reference frame in the same way that the plain - text in classical cryptography is encoded in the bit - wise parity of the cypher - text message and the key .",
    "bob decodes by using the token of alice s frame as a key",
    ".    _ dense coding . _ as noted above in point ( ii ) , the calibration - free communication scheme requires alice to know the entire message to be sent prior to transmitting any systems to bob if she is to achieve the maximum rate . in the communication scheme that first sets up a bounded - size reference frame",
    ", alice can transmit to bob the quantum token of her local reference frame prior to knowing anything about the message .",
    "consequently , alice can use the quantum channel at an early time , when it is perhaps cheaper , to enhance the communication capacity at a future time , when it is known what message is to be sent .",
    "sending the frame token is therefore akin to establishing entanglement in a dense coding scheme  @xcite .",
    "one difference , however , is that the fidelity of communication is never perfect for a bounded - size token whereas a single maximally - entangled state allows for perfect communication of one qubit .      in this section , we present some formal mathematical tools that are useful for describing classical and quantum reference frames .",
    "we follow the notation of  @xcite , to which we refer the reader for further details .",
    "suppose alice and bob are considering a single quantum system described by a hilbert space @xmath25 .",
    "let this system transform via a representation of a group @xmath7 relative to some reference frame .",
    "we will restrict our attention to lie groups that are compact , so that they possess a group - invariant ( haar ) measure @xmath14 , and act on @xmath25 via a _ unitary _",

    "it allows for a decomposition of the hilbert space into a direct sum of _ charge sectors _ , labeled by an index @xmath29 , where each charge sector carries an inequivalent representation @xmath30 of @xmath7 .",
    "each sector can be further decomposed into a tensor product of a subsystem @xmath31 carrying an irreducible representation ( irrep ) of @xmath7 and a subsystem @xmath32 carrying a trivial representation of @xmath7 .",
    "that is , @xmath33 note that this tensor product does not correspond to the standard tensor product obtained by combining multiple qubits : it is _ virtual _  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , given that the decoding operation was incoherent over these irreps , it is always possible to make a projective measurement that distinguishes these .",

    "another point worth noting : if alice is sending a large number of systems and bob wishes to implement probabilistically perfect error correction on some subset of them , he must wait until he has collected all of the systems in that subset .",
    "the reason is that he must perform a joint measurement on the composite of these and the rf token .",
    "furthermore , after his measurement is complete , he has disrupted the state of the rf token and he can no longer achieve perfect error correction for any other systems .",
    "the tradeoffs involved in such postselectively perfect decoding schemes are an interesting topic for future research .",
