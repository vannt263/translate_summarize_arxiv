    "the calculation of gluon bremsstrahlung from high - energy particles traversing a quark - gluon plasma is complicated by the landau - pomeranchuk migdal ( lpm ) effect : at high energy , the formation length for bremsstrahlung ( the distance over which gluon or photon emission is coherent ) becomes longer than the mean free path between scatterings . as a result ,",
    "bremsstrahlung from successive scatterings can not be treated as independent . for qed ,",
    "migdal solved this problem in 1956 .",
    "the basic formalism for treating the lpm effect in qcd was worked out by baier , dokshitzer , mueller , peign and schiff ( bdmps ) and zakharov in 1996 - 1998 @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of variations on attacking the problem since then , but the one i want to focus on here is that of myself , moore , and yaffe ( amy ) @xcite .",
    "the amy formalism has been used for the calculation of transport coefficients , such as shear and bulk viscosity , to leading - order in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the amy formalism was derived independently because , at the time , we did not understand the bdmps - zakharov formalism and could not see how to overcome some of its limitations .",
    "one of the limitations of the amy formalism was that it was formulated only for the case of a uniform , infinite - volume system , which means systems which are approximately uniform over one formation length ( and do not change over the corresponding formation time ) .",
    "bdmps - zakharov , in contrast , could handle the non - uniform , time - dependent case as well , such as a system whose size is smaller than the formation length . on the downside ,",
    "bdmps - zakharov implicitly treated plasma particles as static scatterers .",
    "furthermore , their results were normalized in terms of the gluon mean free path @xmath5 . that s a problem for small coupling expansions because @xmath5 is _ zero _ in ( hard - thermal - loop resummed ) perturbation theory ! a popular model for @xmath5 , often used as an example by bdmps , is perturbative coulomb scattering cut off by debye screening , with the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the transverse momentum transfer , @xmath8 is the density of plasma particles , and @xmath9 is the debye mass .",
    "the debye effect screens electric fields , but it does not screen nearly - static components of magnetic fields . as a result , magnetic scattering can take place at much smaller @xmath7 , and the actual formula representing perturbative scattering with screening effects is @xmath10 this is infrared log divergent , giving @xmath11 .",
    "the result i have to report @xcite is that , with minor tweaking of the way bdmps - zakharov write their formulas , one can eliminate all the above issues and then easily show that bdmps - zakharov reproduces amy in the uniform , infinite medium limit .",
    "so , there is now a bdmps - zakharov formalism that handles non - static scatterers , and equivalently there is now a version of amy for non - uniform media .",
    "@xcite ( section ii.b and the appendix ) for details .",
    "the basic tweak to bdmps - zakharov is to write their formulas more generally in terms of the rate @xmath12 for elastic scattering off of the medium instead of as density @xmath13 times the corresponding cross - section @xmath14 , and to avoid normalizing quantities by @xmath5 .",
    "to fully evaluate the bremsstrahlung rate to leading order in @xmath4 requires somewhat complicated numerics , even in the case of uniform media .",
    "there is a great deal of simplification if one makes the additional approximation that the logarithm @xmath0 of energy is large [ while still treating @xmath15 $ ] . with this large logarithm approximation ,",
    "it is possible to get analytic results . to make practical use of a large logarithm expansion",
    ", however , one needs a next - to - leading log ( nll ) result .",
    "leading log can not tell the difference , for example , between @xmath16 but these two logarithms are very different for realistic values of @xmath17 .",
    "but , even if one has a nll result , is it any use in practical situations , or is @xmath18 never large enough ?",
    "a test is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arnolddogan ] , which gives results from ref.@xcite .",
    "the solid lines are results from a full leading - order evaluation of the @xmath19 bremsstrahlung rate ( equivalent to the sort of calculations first performed by jeon and moore @xcite based on the amy formalism ) , as a function of the bremsstrahlung gluon energy @xmath20 divided by @xmath21 .",
    "the dashed lines show the result of the nll calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "the horizontal axes goes up to the very large , absurdly unrealistic value @xmath22 just to verify that the curves do approach each other as @xmath23 ( for fixed @xmath24 ) , as they should .",
    "the conclusion to take away from this plot is that , in the context of a weakly - coupled plasma , the large logarithm expansion to nll is good to @xmath25 for @xmath26 , which is much better than one might have feared . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the nll results is off from the full small - coupling result by roughly a factor of two .",
    "bremsstrahlung rate in an infinite , uniform medium .",
    "solid line is a full calculation to leading order in @xmath4 . making the further approximation that @xmath28 is large , and working to nll order , gives the dashed line .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for normalization of vertical axis . ]",
    "finally , i want to wrap up this potpourri by discussing the value of the jet broadening parameter @xmath3 in the limit of weak coupling",
    ". @xmath3 is defined as the averaged squared transverse momentum transfer @xmath29 per unit length to a high - energy particle traversing the plasma , so that @xmath30 .",
    "it s of relevance to bremsstrahlung because the formation time depends on the collinearity of the bremsstrahlung gluon with the particle that emits it , and the degree of collinearity in turn depends on how much the particles are randomly deflected during the bremsstrahlung process .",
    "the squared transverse momentum transfer per unit length is simply @xmath31 where @xmath12 is the rate for elastic scattering from plasma particles , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : qhat ] , and @xmath7 is the transverse momentum transfer in a single collision . when evaluated at leading - order in @xmath4 ( and ignoring the running of @xmath4 ) , this formula is uv log divergent . for the bremsstrahlung problem ,",
    "however , what one actually needs is the result @xmath32 obtained by introducing a uv cut - off @xmath33 on the @xmath7 integration @xcite .    ) off of a plasma particle ( @xmath34 ) . ]    the calculation of the @xmath35 needed in ( [ eq : qhat ] ) , based on the leading - order process of fig .",
    "[ fig : qhat ] , has the form @xmath36 , \\label { eq : dgam}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the bose or fermi distribution for finding a particle with momentum @xmath38 in the plasma .",
    "the @xmath39 factor is a bose enhancement or pauli blocking factor for the final state of the plasma particle .",
    "most perturbative calculations of @xmath3 have made additional simplifications to this formula .",
    "some implicitly ignore the final - state @xmath40 factor , which is ignorable only when the dominant momentum transfers @xmath41 are large compared to @xmath21 , and even then only to leading - log order .",
    "others replace @xmath42 by @xmath43 , valid if the dominant @xmath41 are small compared to @xmath21 . to my knowledge",
    ", the result has only recently been evaluated using the full form ( [ eq : dgam ] ) @xcite . for @xmath44",
    "[ but @xmath45 $ ] , an analytic small - coupling result for uv - regulated @xmath3 is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . as an example , for a purely gluonic plasma , it is approximation of replacing @xmath46 by @xmath47 in ( [ eq : dgam ] ) , the result would be @xmath48      \\frac{9 g^4 t^3}{\\pi^3 }    $ ] .",
    "if one instead made the @xmath49 approximation of dropping the @xmath50 term in ( [ eq : dgam ] ) , the result would be @xmath51      \\frac{9 g^4 t^3}{\\pi^3 }    $ ] .",
    "a rough approximation one sees in the literature is to ( i ) replace the final factor of @xmath52 in ( [ eq : qhat ] ) by @xmath53 , which artificially eliminates the uv log divergence and gives @xmath54 , and ( ii ) use the model form ( [ eq : lambda1 ] ) for the gluon mean free path @xmath5 .",
    "this gives @xmath55      \\frac{9 g^4 t^3}{\\pi^3 }    $ ] in the purely gluonic case , for which @xmath56 in ( [ eq : lambda1 ] ) . ]",

    "i think the expression ( [ eq : qhatresult ] ) for @xmath3 is fun and interesting .",
    "but if you are of a more practical bent , you could have instead just done the integral ( [ eq : dgam ] ) numerically .",
    "a presentation of @xmath3 to leading order in @xmath4 requires an important warning : corrections which are formally higher - order in coupling , of order @xmath63 , have been analyzed by caron - huot @xcite and are of order 100% for realistic couplings .",
