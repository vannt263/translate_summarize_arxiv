    "the study of mhd free - convective flow and mass transfer over a stretching sheet has become a considerable attention to the researchers due to its many engineering and industrial applications such as , in polymer processing , electro - chemistry , mhd power generators as well as in flight magnetohydrodynamics . in the extrusion of a polymer sheet from a die ,",
    "the sheet is some times stretched . by drawing such a sheet in a viscous fluid",
    ", the rate of cooling can be controlled and the final product of the desired characteristics can be achieved .",
    "this problem has also an important bearing on metallurgy where magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) techniques have recently been used .",
    "crane ( crane 1970 ) first introduced the study of steady two - dimensional boundary layer flow caused by a stretching sheet whose velocity varies linearly with the distance from a fixed point in the sheet . later on several investigators ( cf .",

    "the influence of a uniform transverse magnetic field on the motion of an electrically conducting fluid past a stretching sheet was investigated by pavlov ( pavlov 1974 ) , chakraborty and gupta ( chakraborty and gupta 1979 ) , kumari et al .",

    "the effect of chemical reaction on free - convective flow and mass transfer of a viscous , incompressible and electrically conducting fluid over a stretching sheet was investigated by afify ( afify 2004 ) in the presence of transverse magnetic field . in all these investigations",
    "the electrical conductivity of the fluid was assumed to be uniform .",
    "however , in an ionized fluid where the density is low and/or magnetic field is very strong , the conductivity normal to the magnetic field is reduced due to the spiraling of electrons and ions about the magnetic lines of force before collisions take place and a current induced in a direction normal to both the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this phenomenon available in the literature , is known as hall effect .",
    "thus , the study of magnetohydrodynamic viscous flows , heat and mass transfer with hall currents has important bearing in the engineering applications .",
    "+ hall effects on mhd boundary layer flow over a continuous semi - infinite flat plate moving with a uniform velocity in its own plane in an incompressible viscous and electrically conducting fluid in the presence of a uniform transverse magnetic field were investigated by watanabe and pop ( watanabe and pop 1995 ) .",

    "+ the aim of this paper is to study the hall effects on the steady mhd free - convective flow and mass transfer over a stretching sheet in the presence of a uniform transverse magnetic field .",
    "the boundary layer equations are transformed by a similarity transformation into a system of non - linear ordinary differential equations and which are solved numerically by using the finite difference technique .",
    "numerical calculations were performed for various values of the magnetic parameter , hall parameter and the relative effect of chemical diffusion on thermal diffusion parameters .",
    "the results are given for the velocity distribution and the coefficients of skin - friction along and transverse to the direction of motion of the stretching surface .",
    "similarity solution for the temperature field in the above flow is also found and the rate of heat transfer at the stretching sheet is computed for various values of magnetic and hall parameters . such a study is also applicable to the elongation to the bubbles and in bioengineering where the flexible surfaces of the biological conduits , cells and membranes in living systems are typically lined or surrounded with fluids which are electrically conducting ( e.g. , blood ) and being stretched constantly .",
    "we consider the steady free - convective flow and mass transfer of an incompressible , viscous and electrically conducting fluid past a flat surface which is assuming from a horizontal slit on a vertical surface and is stretched with a velocity proportional to distance from a fixed origin o ( cf .",

    "a uniform magnetic field @xmath5 is imposed along y - axis and the effect of hall currents is taken into account . the temperature and the species concentration",
    "are maintained at a prescribed constant values @xmath6",

    "to , simplify the analysis , we assume that the flow quantities do not vary along z - direction and this will be valid if the surface is of very large width along the @xmath19-direction .",
    "+ under these assumptions the boundary layer free - convection flow with mass transfer and generalized ohm s law is governed by the following system of equations :    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    where @xmath25 are the velocity components along the @xmath26 directions respectively , @xmath27 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath28 the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath29 the coefficient of thermal expansion , @xmath30 the coefficient of expansion with concentration , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the temperature and concentration respectively , @xmath33 the density of fluid , @xmath34 the thermal diffusivity , @xmath35 the thermal molecular diffusivity , @xmath36 the reaction rate constant and @xmath37 the order of reaction . + the boundary conditions for this problem can be written as @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",

    "although this method provides satisfactory results , it may fail when applied to problems in which the differential equations are very sensitive to the choice of its missing initial conditions .",
    "moreover , difficulty arises in the case in which one end of the range of integration is at infinity . the end point of integration",
    "is usually approximated by replacing a finite representation to this point and it is obtained by estimating a value at which the solution will reach its asymptotic state .",
    "+ on the contrary to the above mentioned numerical method , we used in the present paper has better stability , simple , accurate and more efficient numerical technique .",
    "the essential features of this technique is that it is based on a finite difference scheme with central differencing and based on the iterative procedure .",
