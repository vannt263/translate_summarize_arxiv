    "observation of an atomic electric dipole moment would signal the violation of time - reversal ( t ) symmetry@xcite , which kaon decay tells us is present at some level@xcite .",

    "the level at which dipole moments are finally seen will help decide among a number of candidates for the fundamental source of t violation .",
    "several theorists have proposed that the light actinides would be the best elements in which to detect a small dipole moment@xcite .",

    "@xcite have argued that the existence of octupole ( pear - shaped ) deformation in the nuclei of these atoms enhances the sensitivity of atomic dipole moments to nuclear parity ( p ) and t violation by factors of 100 to 1000 ( typically about 400 in the later reference ) over the sensitivity in the atom with the best current experimental limit , @xmath0hg .",
    "this level of enhancement is due in large part to the existence of close - lying parity doublets and favorable atomic structure in the light actinides , but also to fact that it is not the dipole moment of the nucleus that induces a dipole moment in the surrounding electrons , but rather the `` schiff moment '' , a quantity that reflects the mean - square radius of the nuclear dipole distribution .",

    ", we give a pedagogical derivation of the schiff operator , explore its action on nuclear ground states , and address the role of octupole correlations in generating ground - state schiff moments .",
    "the discussion is organized as follows : section i contains a derivation of the nucleus - electron interaction responsible for atomic - dipole moments and introduces the schiff operator .",
    "the section concludes with an evaluation of the nuclear schiff moment under the assumption that the dominant source of time - reversal invariance is a nucleon electric dipole moment .",
    "section ii reveals important differences between the dipole and schiff operators , showing that in the goldhaber - teller model no schiff strength is produced by the giant dipole resonance . in section iii , we look at schiff moments in light nuclei , particularly @xmath1f , confirming the near absence of schiff strength in the giant resonance and pointing out a strong component of strength correlated with low - lying octupole excitations .",
    "the first excited state provides the largest contribution to the schiff moment .",
    "section iv takes up octupole correlations in heavy nuclei , focusing on octupole deformation .",
    "we find no flaw in the argument that moments in such nuclei are collective and enhanced , but point to physics that may make the enhancement less dramatic than claimed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( more detailed microscopic calculations of both the octupole - deformed nuclei and those that are currently used in experiments should resolve the uncertainty ) .",
    "in section v we argue that the collective schiff moments do not depend on the delicate and sometimes unanswerable question of whether a nucleus is octupole deformed .",
    "low - lying octupole vibrations generate them in the same way as static octupole deformation , increasing the number of atoms in which one can expect large effects .",

    ", internal coulomb forces between electrons and nuclei counter each other so that there is no net force on the molecule ( or it would move ) . in the system we consider here , a neutral atom in a uniform electric field , there is no net charge so there is no net force on the system . to achieve this",
    "the electrons rearrange themselves @xcite so that there is no net electric field at the nucleus ( or it would move ) .",
    "this shielding effect has dramatic and unfortunate implications for experiments that would probe the atom - nucleus system .",

    "in the rest of this paper we will assume that a p , t - violating component of the nucleon - nucleon interaction causes a schiff moment in the distribution of protons , but we conclude this section by briefly describing another possibility : that dipole moments of individual nucleons are responsible for the nuclear schiff moment .",
    "we introduce proton and neutron ( isotopic ) projection operators , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , for the i@xmath11 nucleon .",

    "for our considerations , as we have said , the most important mechanism for a nuclear ground - state electric dipole or schiff moment is the action of a pseudoscalar t - violating nucleon - nucleon potential , @xmath91 .",
    "this induces a schiff moment given by second - order perturbation theory : @xmath92 where the state @xmath93 has @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the @xmath96-component of the schiff - moment operator @xmath59 .",
    "the distribution of schiff strength to the excited states @xmath97 is therefore a crucial ingredient in the ground - state moment . at first sight",

    "most of the electric dipole strength is in a broad resonance at 10 to 20 mev of excitation energy .",
    "almost none of the schiff strength , however , goes to the states in the giant resonance .",
    "in fact , in the simple but venerable goldhaber - teller ( gt ) model , in which the giant dipole resonance corresponds to the @xmath99 oscillation of all the protons with respect to all the neutrons , the schiff strength to the resonance is identically zero .    to see this , we start by assuming@xcite rigid distributions for the @xmath3 protons and for the @xmath100 neutrons , which oscillate harmonically about their cm with frequency @xmath101 .",
    "the separation of the two rigid spherical ( for simplicity ) distributions is denoted @xmath102 and the distance of the proton cm from the overall cm is @xmath103 .",

    "we will see that the same is nearly true in real nuclei .",
    "to understand in greater detail the distribution of schiff strength and the resulting ground - state schiff moment , we first examine the situation in light nuclei .",
    "although the small radii and charges of light nuclei mean that their schiff moments will not be large compared to those of heavy nuclei , they have the advantage that their structure can be calculated at a detailed microscopic level .    what kinds of excitations will carry the schiff strength ?",
    "we describe elementary excitations in terms of harmonic - oscillator shell - model quanta ( @xmath117 ) ; these are not exactly the same as the @xmath117 of the goldhaber - teller model , but the two are related .",
    "as shown by brink@xcite , the electric dipole operator @xmath46 can excite only those components of the harmonic - oscillator shell - model hamiltonian ( with no residual interactions ) corresponding to the giant resonance .",
    "that is , the simple 1@xmath117 electric dipole excitations in the harmonic oscillator are exactly the same as in the goldhaber - teller model .",

    "let us see how this physics works out in @xmath1f , which has odd a and is therefore able to have a ground - state schiff moment .",
    "the ground state of @xmath1f is the @xmath144 head of a @xmath145 rotational band , while the first excited state ( a 1/2@xmath137 state at 110 kev ) is the basis for a 4p-1h ( @xmath146 ) @xmath147 band .",
    "su(3)-basis shell - model calculations@xcite for these two bands indicate that the @xmath148 band is an octupole excitation of the ground - state band ( in fact @xmath1f is considered the closest thing among light nuclei@xcite to an octupole - deformed system , though a nonnegligible part of the @xmath148 state is an isovector excitation ) .",
    "though this relation in itself implies large e3 and schiff matrix elements between these two bands , we have to go beyond these old restricted calculations to get the full picture , for two reasons .",
    "first , the just - mentioned octupole ground - state correlations that further enhance the schiff strength were omitted .",
    "second , we need to ensure realistic behavior for the strength distribution of the p , t - violating nn interaction , which according to eq.([eq : sm ] ) is as important as the schiff - strength distribution in determining the ground - state schiff moment .",
    "fortunately , its behavior is much simpler . for the sake of pedagogy",
    ", we consider in this section a simple but often accurate@xcite one - body approximation to @xmath91 : @xmath149 in both isovector and isoscalar channels ( we will use a more sophisticated one - body approximation later ) . the @xmath150 e1 and @xmath91 operators then differ only in their effect on spin ( they are in the same su(4 ) multiplet ) .",
    "the strength from the isovector @xmath151 is therefore concentrated in an su(4 ) analog of the giant dipole resonance , and to first approximation lies at the same energy .",
    "the isoscalar strength is also mostly in a resonance at a similar energy , so that low - lying p , t - violating strength is depleted@xcite .",

    "nuclei with strong low - lying octupole vibrations should also show enhancement . as the e3 strength moves up in energy ( and/or the octupole collectivity is diluted )",
    ", so should the dominant contribution to the schiff strength , and the schiff moments will become smaller . in the remainder of this paper we examine the extent to which these statements are true in heavy nuclei , where shell - model calculations are not possible .",
    "we begin our discussion with a short review of the arguments of ref.@xcite , the crux of which is related to what we have already discussed : the ground - state schiff moment need not be directly related to the dipole moment , and in the case of octupole - deformed nuclei is considerably more enhanced .",
    "the authors adopted the particle - rotor model , which is not fully microscopic and omits a certain amount of valence - space physics .",
    "the arguments are based on collective octupole correlations , however , and this model represents them clearly and efficiently .    in the particle - rotor model the nucleus is described as a single particle coupled to a collective core , the shape of which can be specified through a function that describes the dependence of its radius on angle : @xmath156 where @xmath157 . in the intrinsic frame of a deformed nucleus three of the @xmath158 variables",

    "the coordinates of the individual nucleons in the core are integrated over in the intrinsic frame to give an operator that is a function of the collective coordinates and those of the odd particle , and can be applied to wave functions of these same coordinates . when one does the integration for the schiff operator , assuming a nuclear charge density proportional to the mass density ( so that the intrinsic dipole moment is zero ) , the result is @xmath186 where the last term is the contribution of the valence particle , which in this case can be neglected compared to the collective piece . without the hats , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sop ] ) is just the classical schiff moment of a deformed drop .",

    "in fact , it is often reasonable to ignore all other states in the sum ( see the shell - model result for @xmath1f in fig .",
    "3 ) , mainly because of the energy denominator , but also because if the deformation is strong enough the matrix element of the schiff operator to that state is likely to be large .",
    "the reason for that is that the doublets can be viewed as the projection onto positive and negative parity of the same reflection - asymmetric intrinsic state @xmath189 .",
    "the existence of more than one state with the same intrinsic structure is exactly the same phenomenon as the rotational bands associated with ordinary reflection - symmetric deformation .",
    "the matrix element of an operator between the two states of the same doublet is proportional to the diagonal intrinsic - state matrix element of the intrinsic operator , just as it is for states within a rotational band . for the operator @xmath180 ,",

    "thus , from eq.([eq : sm ] ) , the physical ground - state schiff moment @xmath153 that determines the atomic electric dipole moment should be approximately @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the opposite - parity partner of the ground state @xmath193 , @xmath194 is the energy difference between the two states , and @xmath183 is the intrinsic schiff moment ( the @xmath163-dependent factor is from the euler - angle integration ) .",
    "the conclusion from all this is that large intrinsic schiff moments and small energy denominators should make atoms with octupole - deformed nuclei especially sensitive tests of p , t - violation in the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",

    "a simple argument@xcite with a schematic residual interaction in rpa shows that the existence of the giant dipole resonance of the core suppresses e1 transitions between low - lying single - particle states by a factor of 3 or 4 that depends only on the energy of the resonance and the energy at which strength would be centered if there were no resonance .",
    "the low - lying transitions induced by @xmath230 should be suppressed by roughly the same amount because the operator @xmath231 is so much like @xmath167 ( again , see fig .  2 ) .",
    "in many - body perturbation theory , this effect can be understood as core polarization : the residual strong interaction can create a collective @xmath232 p - h pair , at the same time changing the parity of the valence particle .",

    "the suppression by the residual interaction of one part of the schiff moment by a factor of three without any effect on another part may upset any balance between the two at the mean - field level produced by the similarity between the density and the potential",

    "such calculations are within the range of today s mean - field technology , and in even - even nuclei they have already been carried out@xcite , confirming the large intrinsic schiff moments in the radium isotopes@xcite . in self - consistent ( e.g.  skyrme - hfb ) calculations the effects of the residual interaction on the ground state are minimized .",
    "therefore , not only is the relationship between the mean field and the density likely to be most accurate in this case , but it is also least likely to be vitiated by corrections to the single - particle picture . in odd nuclei ,",
    "the first - order core polarization , which has to be treated as a correction to particle - rotor / nilsson models , is built into the mean - field ; 1-particle-1-hole excitations of the core do not mix with the ground state . this fact , together with a realistic two - body interaction that contains all multipole - multipole terms , has implications for corrections to low - lying transitions from resonances , as well as for the density .",
    "the incorporation of core polarization means that the interplay between collective excitations and low - lying states is already apparent at the mean - field level , or in other words that the usual first - order particle - phonon mixing that reduces low - lying single - particle transitions need not be treated by other means ( e.g.  the rpa ) .",
    "we should therefore be able at the mean - field level to go a long way towards quantifying the influence of shape and resonances on schiff moments in octupole - deformed nuclei .",
    "the question of whether the light actinides are octupole deformed has a long history .",
    "in fact the question is not entirely physical  it s really about the economy of one collective - model basis versus another  and it should not matter so much whether the low - lying states in a nucleus are best described as the rotation of an octupole - deformed shape or as a strong low - lying octupole vibration around a rotating quadrupole shape .",

    "<S> we then present shell - model calculations in light nuclei that confirm the negligible role of the dipole resonance and show the schiff strength to be strongly correlated with low - lying octupole strength . </S>",
    "<S> next , we turn to heavy nuclei , examining recent arguments for the strong enhancement of schiff moments in octupole - deformed nuclei over that of @xmath0hg , for example . </S>",
    "<S> we concur that there is a significant enhancement while pointing to effects neglected in previous work ( both in the octupole - deformed nuclides and @xmath0hg ) that may reduce it somewhat , and emphasizing the need for microscopic calculations to resolve the issue . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that static octupole deformation is not essential for the development of collective schiff moments ; nuclei with strong octupole vibrations have them as well , and some could be exploited by experiment . </S>"
