    "ldpc codes were first discovered by gallager in @xcite in the beginning of the sixties .",
    "they regained popularity in the mid - nineties and became a fascinating and highly dynamic research area providing numerous applications .",
    "the main reason of this success is that , thanks to iterative decoding , these codes perform very close to the theoretical shannon limit .",
    "for instance , see @xcite .      in the literature , one can distinguish two general approaches to construct ldpc codes .",
    "the first one is based on random constructions ( for instance see @xcite ) .",
    "the second one is based on combinatorial and algebraic methods involving finite fields , block designs , incidence structures and so on .",
    "the present article focuses on the second approach .",
    "a well  known construction of ldpc codes from incidence structures is due to kou , lin and fossorier in @xcite who proposed to use the points - lines incidence in affine and projective spaces .",
    "kou et al s approach motivated several other works about the study of ldpc codes arising from incidence structures . among them",
    "( and the list is far from being exhaustive ) , other codes from points and lines incidence structures in affine or projective spaces are studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "codes from partial and semi - partial geometries are considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several other well  known incidence structures have also been used to produce good ldpc codes , among them : generalised quadrangles @xcite , generalised polygons @xcite , unital designs @xcite , incidence structures from hermitian curves @xcite , oval designs @xcite , flats @xcite and so on .",
    "an interesting property of ldpc codes from incidence structures is that they are frequently defined by parity  check matrices whose number of rows exceeds their rank .",
    "such matrices are said to be _",
    "redundant_. even if it has no influence on the code , a redundant matrix may improve the efficiency of the iterative decoding .",
    "it is worth noting that sparse matrices obtained by random constructions are generically full rank .",
    "of course , it is always possible to add new rows by linear combinations .",
    "however , a linear combination of a large number of rows is in general non - sparse . on the other hand , adding linear combinations of a small number of rows does not improve the performance of iterative decoding .    in the case of the codes described in the above - cited references , the parity  check matrix is highly redundant and no row is a linear combination of a small number of other rows .",
    "this is particularly interesting for iterative decoding .      in this article",
    ", we introduce new incidence structures obtained from the incidence relations between points and strict transforms of conics on the affine plane blown  up at all of its rational points .",
    "three incidence structures are presented corresponding to three different sets of conics .",
    "these three incidence structures are regular ( each point is incident to a constant number of blocks and each block is incident to a constant number of points ) and any two points of them have at most one block in common .",
    "moreover , the girth of their incidence graph is proved to be either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "using these incidence structures , we construct * binary * ldpc codes and study their parameters .",
    "a formula giving their minimum distance is proved and their dimension is discussed .",
    "two conjectures are stated on the dimensions of some of these codes . using the computer algebra software magma ,",
    "the actual dimension of some codes is computed .",
    "the information rates of these codes turn out to be close to @xmath2 and their parity  check matrices are highly redundant since they are almost square and hence contain twice more parity checks than necessary .",
    "finally , simulations of these codes on the gaussian channel are done and some codes turn out to perform better than regular gallager codes having the same rates and row weight .",
    "the aims of the article are described in section [ aims ] . some necessary background in algebraic geometry (",
    "namely , blow  ups and linear systems of curves ) are recalled in section [ ag ] .",
    "section [ seccon ] is devoted to plane conics .",
    "some well - known basic results on conics are recalled and some lemmas used in what follows are proved .",
    "the context and some conventions are stated in section [ context ] . in section [ secconic ] ,",
    "three sets of conics are introduced and studied .",
    "these three sets are the respective first stones of the constructions of the three new incidence structures presented in the following sections . in section [ bu ] , we introduce the surface @xmath3 obtained by blowing up all the rational points of the affine plane .",
    "we derive three interesting sets of curves on this surface arising from the three sets of conics introduced in the previous section .",
    "this yields three new incidence structures defined in section [ secinc ] .",
    "they are proved to be regular .",
    "explicit formulas for the number of points per block and the number of blocks incident to a point are given .",
    "the girth of the incidence graph of these structures is computed and proved to be either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the number of minimal cycles is estimated . in section [ seccodes ] , the ldpc codes from these incidence structures",
    "are studied .",
    "some computer aided calculations to get the exact information rate of such codes are presented .",
    "finally , simulations on the additive white gaussian noise channel are presented at the end of the article .      in this article ,",
    "lots of notations and terminologies are introduced and maintained throughout the paper . to help the reader , an index of notations and terminologies",
    "is given in appendix [ appc ] .",
