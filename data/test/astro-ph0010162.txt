    "the x - ray emitting gas in clusters of galaxies cools by the emission of energy on a time scale which depends on the temperature and density of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "where the density is higher , in the cores of the clusters , the cooling is more efficient and the temperature falls . to support the outer layers of gas , a subsonic flow of gas occurs towards the central region , producing a _ cooling flow _ that appears in x - rays as an enhancement of the central peak in the surface brightness profile and with a spectrum that presents multiple temperature components .",
    "the stronger the cooling flow , the higher the x - ray luminosity which arises from both the thermal energy lost by the cooling gas and the gravitational work done to maintain the gas at constant pressure . therefore , to compare global cluster gas properties with theoretical and numerical predictions ,",
    "that , at present , can not model the radiative cooling in detail , we need to account fully for the effects of cooling flows on the temperature and luminosity measurements ( fabian et al .",

    "the aim in fitting these models is to check the robustness of the gas temperature estimates against any additional contribution to the thermal emission .",
    "we note , however , that the lecs , which provides data in the soft x - ray part of the spectrum and is used to constrain the intrinsic absorption and the normalization of the cooling flow component , has an energy resolution ( fwhm ) of about 11 per cent at 3 kev , that is comparable to _ asca _ gas scintillation imaging spectrometers ( gis ) but is poorer by a factor of 4 than the solid state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) , which also has an effective area larger by a factor of 10 than the lecs .",

    "it is worth noting that grandi and guainazzi show in the 1999 report on the _ bepposax _ - _ asca _ intercalibration using 3c273 that gis3 provides a normalization of the continuum higher by a factor between 9 and 15 per cent than the corresponding value estimated in the same energy band with mecs for quasi - simultaneous data acquired in 1996 and 1998 .",
    "the relations between the measured ( e.g. gas temperature and luminosity ) and derivative ( e.g. total gravitating mass ) quantities determined from x - ray observations is a basic step in constraining cosmological parameters through the cluster mass function .",
    "the observed values of the intracluster gas luminosity and temperature are correlated due to the fact that the luminosity depends on the cluster baryon fraction and the temperature is a direct measure of the potential well of the dark halo .",
    "in fact , the luminosity , @xmath91 , goes like @xmath92 , where we have considered that ( i ) the gas fraction ratio is constant with redshift , ( ii ) the dark matter density evolves like @xmath93 , and ( iii ) the equation of the hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath94 , holds .    considering that bremsstrahlung emission is the dominant emission process in clusters with @xmath95 kev , the cooling function , @xmath96 , is then proportional to @xmath97 and , consequently",
    ", the bolometric luminosity is proportional to the square of the temperature , @xmath98 .",
    "however , this is only valid for a sufficiently hot cluster where the ambient luminosity and temperature are well determined above any contamination , like the excess in cool emission present in the core of cooling flow clusters ( e.g. fabian et al .",

    "we add these results to a list of _ asca _ measurements of bolometric luminosity and temperature obtained from literature and corrected for the contamination from cooling flows , either by including a cooling flow model in the spectral analysis ( like we have done in the present analysis ; cf . also allen & fabian 1998 ) or excluding the central emission to compose the analyzed spectrum ( e.g. markevitch 1998 ) .",

    "we note that the computation of the physical properties presented in the present work follows the technique used in allen ( 2000 ) and differs from the analysis done by markevitch in the fact that we try to model spectrally the emission from the core , whereas markevitch cuts the core emission from the spectral analysis and extrapolates the contribution from the core to the total luminosity from the external emissivity . to take into account the different way in which the bolometric luminosity is estimated , we leave free the normalization , @xmath123 , in the @xmath2 relation in eqn .",

    "although the instrument characteristics of _ bepposax _ do not allow us to constrain firmly any absorption intrinsic to the cluster atmosphere and/or the normalization of the emission from the central cooling gas , the measurements of the ambient gas temperature are in agreement , within the 90 per cent confidence level , with the results from the analysis of _ asca _ data in allen ( 2000 ) .",
    "in particular , the plasma temperature in rxj1347 - 1145 appears well defined between 13.2 and 22.3 kev ( 90 per cent confidence level ) and above 12.1 kev at the @xmath0 level .",
