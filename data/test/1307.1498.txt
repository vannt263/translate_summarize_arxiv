    "a quantum computer could allow some problems to be solved more efficiently , by enabling efficient execution of quantum algorithms , as compared to executing classical algorithms on a classical computer that are inferior for those problems  @xcite .",
    "the `` classical computer '' refers to a computer that is built strictly according to the principles of classical physics but more specifically is equivalent to a turing machine  @xcite .",
    "the subtle issues of a quantized computer operating over real rather than binary fields are not discussed here  @xcite .",
    "the study of `` quantum simulation '' focuses on simulating properties and dynamics of quantum systems whether by classical or quantum computation , and the topic of `` efficient algorithms for quantum simulation '' focuses on quantum simulation problems that do not have efficient classical algorithms .",
    "let me clear about terminology employed here . by the term simulation ,",
    "i mean that certain pre - specified properties of the quantum system are accurately predicted by the simulation but not necessarily all properties .",
    "accuracy refers to each answer being no worse than some error tolerance  @xmath0 .",
    "for example one might wish to know the mean momentum , the standard deviation of the momentum , and average energy .",
    "the simulation is successful if these quantities are accurately predicted by the simulator even if other irrelevant quantities are poorly predicted .",
    "the term efficiency refers to the simulation yielding an accurate solution to the problem with a resource ( e.g. , run - time and space usage ) cost that increases no faster than a polynomial function of the input bit string and of @xmath1 .",
    "explicitly defining simulation is important because various notions of quantum simulation using quantum computers , either purpose - built or universal , with various terminology .",
    "the term `` digital quantum simulator '' is sometimes employed to refer to a programmable quantum simulator , and the term `` analogue quantum simulator '' refers to a quantum system designed to behave analogously to a the quantum system being studied  @xcite , and usually these terms are employed when error correction is not assumed hence making these systems not scalable .",
    "analogue quantum simulation is sometimes called `` quantum emulation ''  @xcite .",
    "our term `` universal quantum simulator '' is in concordance with `` digital quantum simulator '' provided that the latter uses a fault tolerant architecture as we assume simulation on a scalable quantum computer .",
    "quantum simulation can deal with non - relativistic single - particle quantum mechanics described by schrdinger s equation @xmath2 with self - adjointness @xmath3 implying unitary dynamics , but self - adjointness is not necessary . alternatively",
    "simulation of relativistic quantum mechanics or many - body quantum dynamics  @xcite or quantum field theories  @xcite may be sought . for simplicity",
    "we focus on the easiest case of single - body dynamics  ( [ eq : schr ] ) and thence to the many - body case .    after choosing the equation to be studied",
    ", the question then arises as to which problem is to be solved .",
    "two possible problems include solving the state  @xmath4 over some time domain or determining the spectrum of the hamiltonian  @xmath5 . instead of finding the spectrum or some aspect of the spectrum such as the smallest or largest spectral gap",
    ", the problem could be about finding eigenvectors of  @xmath5 such as the ground state . for simulation purposes",
    "a natural question would be to estimate the expectation values of some observable @xmath6 some of the problems discussed here could be tractable on a classical computer hence making quantum algorithms uninteresting ; other problems such as finding ground states could be intractable as well on a quantum computer  @xcite .",
    "for algorithmic quantum simulation we are interested in those problems that are intractable on a classical computer yet tractable on a quantum computer . we can rule out solving problems that are amenable to the usual classical methods such as the following  @xcite .",
    "one approach is to diagonalize the hamiltonian directly , which is always possible in principle but , as the problem size is polylogarithmic in dimension and diagonalization is polynomially expensive with respect to dimension , the cost of diagonalization is thus superpolynomially expensive hence is not efficient in general .",
    "another approach to quantum simulation is to integrate the dynamical equation , for example schrdinger s equation  ( [ eq : schr ] ) , directly .",
    "for example the runge - kutta technique is popular . alternatively the dynamics",
    "can be tackled by constructing the evolution operator and using the magnus , or baker - campbell - hausdorff method , expansion .",
    "product formul   are valuable as a unitary evolution can be factorized into an approximate product of unitary evolutions .",
    "product formul   include the forest - ruth or symplectic integration , method , and the trotter - suzuki expansion is also valuable , especially for quantum simulation as we shall see .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations include stochastic green functions techniques and variational , diffusion or path - integral monte - carlo methods .",
    "density matrix renormalization group techniques have become popular especially for one - dimensional many - body systems with slowly increasing entanglement with respect to the number of particles .    perhaps the best insight into quantum simulation",
    "can be gained by studying feynman s own words in his seminal 1982 paper on quantum computing based on a his keynote talk on the topic `` simulating physics with computers ''  @xcite .",

    "the resultant state is  @xmath14 . in the quantum computer ,",

    "the essence of this figure , which is fully explained in the caption , is that the quantum simulation necessarily approximates all information and quantum information into bit strings and qubit strings and delivers an approximation to the final state as a finite qubit string .",
    "let us now perform exegesis on feynman s words to seek an understanding of what he meant .",
    "in order to understand his meaning , we delve into computer science notions of complexity , not something that feynman himself used .",
    "thus , we seek to interpret a statement more than three decades old through the lens of modern computational complexity theory .    to understand , we cast quantum simulation as a decision problem : the computational problem is constructed so that the answer can only be yes or no . to assess whether the quantum simulation is efficient",
    ", the question is then how hard , i.e. , how do the computational resources scale with problem size expressed as the number of bits  @xmath9 required to specify the input state , in order to answer the question ?",
    "note that the resources to prove yes or no can differ , which leads to complexity classes and their complements .",
    "we are especially interested in the time and space costs , which we denote as  @xmath19 and  @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "quantum simulation problems are no worse then exp , which is the class of problems that can be solved with  @xmath19 and  @xmath20 increasing no more than an exponential function of  @xmath9 . that exp is the worst case follows from using the heisenberg matrix representation for the dynamics and seeing that the size of the register and the computational time for matrix operations leads to decision problems being in exp .",
    "aaronson points out that feynman ( inadvertently ) reduced the complexity of quantum mechanics to pspace ; i.e. , @xmath20 increases no more than polynomially in  @xmath9 by introducing path integrals  @xcite .",
    "the class of decision problems solvable efficiently on a quantum computer is bqp , which refers to bounded - error quantum polynomial and is inside pspace .",
    "the aim of quantum simulation thus needs to focus on narrower problems than those in pspace .",
    "feynman s words `` give the same probabilities '' hints at the correct approach .",
    "one should ask questions pertaining to expectation values of certain observables and accept answers that are probabilistically equivalent to the true probabilities for these observables in the physical world .",
    "feynman s comment , `` classical kind ",
    "the answer is certainly , no ! '' is more problematic .",
    "he suggests that the classical simulation is provably inferior to the quantum simulation because of `` the hidden - variable problem : it is impossible to represent the results of quantum mechanics with a classical universal device '' .",
    "this question of provable superiority remains unresolved today , and the hidden - variable problem does not lead to its resolution .",
    "feynman s idea that there is a strict separation between two computational complexity classes can be regarded as a hard one to settle by thinking about this problem along the lines of any reduction in the polynomial complexity hierarchy .",
    "such problems are famously difficult .",
    "lloyd recognized in 1996 that the key to formalizing feynman s claim lay in how to discrete the time evolution into discrete gate steps with a bound on the accumulated error due to time discretization  @xcite .",
    "specifically lloyd used the trotter product formula @xmath21 to approximate the evolution operator , with the hamiltonian expressed as the sum @xmath22 as @xmath23\\frac{t^2}{2r}+{\\rm error}.\\ ] ] lloyd proved that this simulation had a @xmath19 and @xmath20 costs that are only poly@xmath24 .",
    "this result can generalized to a time - dependent hamiltonian and the errors tightened  @xcite .    in 2003 ,",
    "aharonov and ta - shma analyzed the general question of what hamiltonian systems are efficiently simulatable  @xcite .",
    "their work was motivated by strong claims about adiabatic quantum computing solving np - hard problems .",
    "they tackled the problem by considering which quantum states can be efficiently generated and cast the problem into the oracle setting : @xmath5 is in a black - box , which is queried with an assigned cost per query .",
    "a key result of their work is their demonstration of equivalence between quantum state generation and statistical zero knowledge problems .",
    "another important result is the sparse hamiltonian lemma : if @xmath5 acting on @xmath9 qubits is @xmath25-sparse s.t .",
    "@xmath26 and the list of nonzero entries in each row is efficiently computable , then @xmath5 is _ simulatable _ if @xmath27 .",

    "the suzuki iteration method leads to a much more efficient way of performing this unitary factorization , i.e. , to a product of unitary gates with the length of this sequence of unitary gates being @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian in the oracle is promised to be @xmath25-sparse with @xmath41poly@xmath24 .",
    "this creates the algorithmic challenge of reducing the @xmath25-sparse hamiltonian into a disjoint sum of one - sparse hamiltonians .",
    "the decomposition is aided by first converting sparse hamiltonians into graphs of low degree and then colouring the graph so that it is a disjoint union of degree - one graphs ; hence the corresponding hamiltonian is a direct sum of one - sparse hamiltonians each corresponding to one colour of the graph  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is converted to a graph as follows .",
    "let  @xmath42 label a row of the hamiltonian matrix and  @xmath43 the column .",
    "as the hamiltonian is @xmath25-sparse , there are at most  @xmath25 column numbers that hold nonzero elements for row  @xmath42 .",
    "we call these column entries @xmath44 in no particular order ; i.e. , the increasing sequence of indices @xmath45 does not imply increasing values of  @xmath46 . now construct the graph by assigning each",

    "the hamiltonian is thus faithfully represented by a degree-@xmath25 undirected graph .",

    "one cost is reduced at the expense of the other .",
    "although the efficiency of quantum simulation has been known for quite some time , quantum simulations could be the first practical application of quantum computing .",
    "cost reductions reduce the waiting time for non - trivial quantum simulations to become a reality and hence are important .    .",
    "key developments in reducing time @xmath19 and space @xmath20 costs for a quantum computer to simulate time - independent hamiltonian generated evolution as a function of the number of qubits  @xmath9 representing the system , the sparseness  @xmath25 of the hamiltonian , the allowed error  @xmath0 , and the norm of the hamiltonian @xmath52 .",
