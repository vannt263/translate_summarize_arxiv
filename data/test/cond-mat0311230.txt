    "logistic growth is one of the basic models in population dynamics .",
    "first introduced by verhulst for saturated proliferation at a single site , it has been extended to include spatial dynamics by fisher @xcite and by kolmogoroff et .",
    "al . @xcite . in its one - dimensional continuum version ,",
    "one consider the concentration of a reactant , @xmath0 , with time evolution that is given by the rate equation : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the diffusion constant , @xmath3 is the growth rate and @xmath4 is the saturation coefficient set by the carrying capacity of the medium .    the fisher process is a generic description of the invasion of a stable phase into an unstable region .",
    "it is applicable to wide range of phenomena , ranging from genetics ( the original context of fisher work , proliferation of a favored mutation or gene ) to population dynamics , chemical reactions in unstirred reactors , hydrodynamic instabilities , invasion of normal states by superconducting front , spinodal decomposition and many other branches of natural sciences .",
    "a comprehensive survey may be found in recent review article by van - saarloos @xcite .",
    "the fisher process ends up with a uniform saturated phase , in contrast with other nonlinear and reactive systems that yields spatial structures with no underlying inhomogeneity .",
    "these patterns are usually related to an instability of the homogenous solution , most commonly of turing or hopf types @xcite .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking of that type manifests itself in vegetation patterns , where competition of flora for common resource ( water ) induces an indirect interaction and may lead to a ( turing like ) spatial segregation @xcite .",
    "the basic motivation of this work comes from recent study of non - turing mechanism for pattern formation in the vegetation - water system , that yields ordered or glassy structures @xcite . basically , it is easy to realize that _",
    "competition for common resource induced some indirect `` repulsion '' among agents , that may lead to spatial segregation_. as an example , consider the vegetation case : there is a constant flow of water into the system ( rain ) , and the water dynamics ( evaporation , percolation , diffusion ) is much faster than the dynamics of the flora .",
    "now let us assume the existence of a large amount of flora ( say , a tree ) at certain spatial point .",
    "one may expect the water density to adjust ( almost instantly ) to the tree and to equilibrate in some water profile that is lower around its location .",
    "the immediate neighborhood of the tree , though , is less favorable for a second tree to flourish ; instead one may expect the next to grow up some typical distance away , reducing the water level between them even more .",
    "this seems to be a plausible and generic mechanism for segregation induced by resource competition .",
    "these arguments may be relevant to the dynamics of almost any unstirred reactive system ; interesting example is the process of evolutionary _ speciation _ , where new species may survive only `` far enough '' ( in the genome space , where the spatial structure is given , say , by hamming distance ) from its ancestor , in order to find a non - overlaping biological niche .",
    "surprisingly it turns out that the partial differential equations that describe this process ( here presented in a nondimensionalized form , where @xmath5 stands for water density , @xmath4 for flora and @xmath6 is the `` rain '' ) : @xmath7 yield only a linearly _ stable _ homogenous solution . in order to get patterns",
    "one should add a cross - diffusion effect ( slowing down of the water diffusion in the presence of flora ) that leads to turing - like instability as in @xcite , but this is a different mechanism , and one may wander about the validity of the basic intuitive argument presented above .    recent work @xcite suggests a hint for the answer .",
    "it seems that a continuum and local description of a reactive system fails to capture the competition induced segregation discussed above .",
    "the continuum process is trying to `` smear '' the reactant profile , and instead of getting spatially segregated structure of large biomass units ( `` trees '' ) it favors homogenous profile of `` grass '' covering all the area . in @xcite a biomass unit was allowed for long time survival only if it exceeds some pre - determined threshold , and simulation of the system reveal an immediate appearance of spontaneous segregation and stable patterns .",
    "similar situation appears , presumably , in the process of bacterial colony growth where the food supply is limited . as noted by ben - jacob et .",
    "@xcite , spatial segregation and branching are induced by the competition of bacteria for diffusive food .",
    "a communicating walkers model is used by these authors to simulate the branching on a petri - dish , where continuum equation dictates the food dynamics while the individual bacteria are discrete objects .",
    "the discreteness of bacteria adds some weak threshold to the system and induces segregation .",
    "note , however , that the model admits weak dependence of the diffusion on the local bacterial density at the boundaries of the colony .    in this work",
    "i consider the one - species analogy of the competition problem , namely , a logistic growth with _ nonlocal interactions _ , where the carrying capacity at a site is reduced due to the presence of `` life '' in another site .",
    "nonlocal competition has been recently considered by sayama et al .",
    "@xcite and by fuentes et al . @xcite .",
    "both groups uncover the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking and patterns , depending on the the strength and the smoothness of the `` weight function '' that controls the nonlocality .",
    "it seems that nonlocal interactions are not simply an effective model obtained by integrating out the fast degrees of freedom ; rather , it incorporates some nonlinear effects ( like the threshold ) and allow for linear instability that manifests the intuitive `` competition induced segregation '' argument .",
    "sayama et al .",
    "@xcite deal with a two dimensional model of population dynamics , with no diffusion term . both the local growth term and the carrying capacity at a site depend ( not in the same way ) on the population of neighboring sites",
    "; in a crowded neighborhood the growth term becomes larger ( due to offspring migration ) while the carrying capacity decreases as a result of long range competition .",
    "the conditions for an instability of the homogenous solution have been found analytically and demonstrated numerically for a `` stepwise '' weight function ( taking as the effective neighborhood the average density inside a prescribed radius around the site ) .",
    "it was also pointed out that a gaussian weight function yields no instability .    in the numerical work of @xcite ,",
    "a one dimensional realization of diffusing reactants has been considered , equivalent to fisher equation with non - local interactions .",
    "again it was shown that a stepwise weight function may lead to instability while a gaussian weights lead to stable homogenous solution ; the authors proceed to consider intermediate weight functions that interpolate between gaussian and a step function .    as in any case of spontaneous symmetry breaking , the system falls locally into one of the `` minima '' of the order parameter , and typically domains are formed .",
    "these domain walls determine the low lying excitation spectrum of the system , as their movement is `` smooth '' : if the broken symmetry is continuous the resulting goldstone modes may destroy the long range order at finite temperature , and the same is true for the domain walls if discrete symmetry is broken .",
    "although we are dealing with an out of equilibrium system , one may guess that the response to small noise is determined by these domain walls .",
    "the goals of this work are twofold : in the next section i will try to give more comprehensive discussion of the instability condition , with and without diffusion , and its dependence on the weight functions : it turns out that it depends on the minimal value of its fourier transform .",
    "the third section is devoted to the appearance of topological defects in the segregated phase . finally in section",
    "iv some discussion and possible implications are presented .",
    "the model is a one dimensional realization of long - range competition system on a lattice ( with lattice spacing @xmath8 ) and the continuum limit is trivailly attained at @xmath9 .    in the generic case of diffusion and non -",
    "locality the time evolution of the reactant density at the n - th site , @xmath10 , is given by :    @xmath11 + a \\widetilde{c}_n(t )   \\nonumber \\\\   & -&b \\widetilde{c}_n^{2}(t ) - \\widetilde{c}_n(t ) \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\widetilde{\\gamma}_r [ \\widetilde { c}_{n+r}(t)+\\widetilde{c}_{n - r}(t)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is the diffusion constant and @xmath13 are the corresponding reaction rates .",
    "the definition of dimensionless quantities , @xmath14 ( the new `` diffusion constant '' is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the width of the fisher front ) provides the dimensionless equation , @xmath17 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & c_n \\left ( 1-c_n- \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\gamma_r [ c_{n+r}+ c_{n - r } ] \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that may be expressed in fourier space [ with @xmath18 as , @xmath19 where @xmath20 \\\\ \\beta_k \\equiv 1 + 2\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\gamma_r cos(rkl_0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath21 is positive semi - definite , @xmath22 is always `` macroscopic '' .",
    "any mode is suppressed by @xmath22 , and for small @xmath23 one expects only the zero mode to survives @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath23 increased above some threshold , bifurcation may occur with the activization of some other @xmath24 mode(s ) , and the homogenous solution becomes unstable .",
    "this is the situation where patterns appear and translational symmetry breaks .    to get a basic insight into the problem ,",
    "let us consider the case with * no diffusion * ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",

    "the sum of the elements of any row of @xmath29 is the same , so the homogenous state ( scalar multiplication of @xmath32 ) should be an eigenvector .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath29 is non - singular it must admit a full set of mutually orthogonal eigenvectors .",
    "only the constant eigenvector of @xmath33 has nonvanishing projection on @xmath34 , so the only _ positive definite _ , non diverging steady state ( @xmath35 ) solution is the _ homogenous _ one , @xmath36",

    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , the homogenous steady state is unstable iff , for some @xmath24 , @xmath39 . in that case",

    "an outcome of forward euler integration of eq .",

    "the results for few types of interaction ranges , with the critical value @xmath44 ( where the instability occurs ) , and @xmath45 ( the first excited mode ) , are summarized in table i.    [ table ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is interesting to note that these expressions may be generalized to yield a full , period doubling type , instability cascade .",
    "the m - th instability involves @xmath46 modes , and the steady state is @xmath47 , where the sum runs over all the `` active '' modes .",
    "the condition for the @xmath48 bifurcation [ activation of another @xmath49 modes ] is the existence of a wavenumber @xmath50 such that @xmath51 , with the sum runs , again , over all @xmath46 active k - s .",
    "there are , however , some obstacles for the implication of these solutions above the first bifurcation . degeneracies in @xmath43 ( e.g. , for @xmath52 , both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are minima ) , and solitons between different stable phases ( described below ) may blur the native state . in this letter , though , @xmath43 is used only for the first , pattern - forming , instability criteria , and the details of the emerged structure are presented just for nearest - neighbor interaction .    once diffusion is added to the system , its features changes , but not so much .",
    "the homogenous state is still characterized by @xmath55 and the first pattern formation instability appears when some @xmath24 mode satisfy : @xmath56.\\ ] ] above this instability , the amplitudes of the modes are not equal , @xmath57 and there are no zeroes of @xmath21 .",
    "this result fits perfectly with the numerical data presented in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "again the m - th instability involves the activation of @xmath46 modes , although the stability analysis is more complicated .",
    "the question of pattern instability is thus translated to the determination of the minimal value of the fourier coefficient of the weight function ( or the `` weight series '' @xmath23 ) .",
    "if the minimal value is smaller than some prescribed number ( zero if there is no diffusion ) instability takes place and patterns emerge .",
    "unfortunately i am not familiar with a general theorem that sets bounds on the minimal value of the fourier coefficient of a function based on its `` smoothness '' , or other analytic properties , so any case should be considered separately , with the generic examples given in table i.",
    "above the pattern formation threshold generic initial conditions fail to yield perfect `` lattice '' , as different domains reach saturation with different `` phases '' .",
    "these domains are connected by soliton - like solutions of the time independent equation in the following sense : any stable solution ( @xmath58 ) should satisfy ( in the continuum limit ) , @xmath59 thus it looks like a trajectory of mechanical particle ( with mass d ) in a nonlocal potential , with @xmath60 as the `` time '' . a domain wall is a finite size structure , so it must connect fixed points of this fictitious dynamics , i.e. , a domain wall corresponds to _",
    "heteroclinic orbit_. in this section we consider these `` solitons '' and look for their shape and size at different conditions .",
    "in order to simplify the discussion , only the nearest neighbor case is considered , both with and without diffusion .    with no diffusion and n.n .",
    "competition , ( [ nodiff ] ) takes the form : @xmath61.\\ ] ] the uniform solution , in this case , is @xmath62 , and the nonuniform solution is , either @xmath63 for odd n and @xmath64 for even , or vice versa .",
    "stability analysis shows that the uniform solution becomes unstable at @xmath65 , and the zero - one phase is stable above this value .",
    "one may expect , though , to see a jump from homogenous to patterned ( zero - one ) phase at @xmath66 .",
    "however , if the initial conditions are taken from random distribution , there is a chance for a domain wall between two regions , as indicated by the numerical results presented in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "clearly , such a soliton should be a solution of the `` map '' @xmath67 of course , 01010101 ... ( odd 0-s ) and 101010101 ... ( even 0-s ) are already solutions of this equation .",
    "we are looking for the solution that connect these two fixed points .",
    "such a trajectory begins in , say , 010101010 state , but then after the zero it gives not 1 but @xmath68 .",
    "the dynamics now continue in a different trajectory , but @xmath68 should be selected such that after l steps of the map ( for domain wall of size l ) the 101010 solution is rendered . in a matrix form ,",
    "the condition that determined @xmath69 ( @xmath68 for a given l ) is : @xmath70^l \\left ( \\begin{array}{c }   x^l_1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right ) = \\mathcal{m}^l \\left ( \\begin{array}{c }   x^l_1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right ) .\\ ] ] where we assume symmetry of the soliton , so l must be even .",

    "( [ fig2 ] , see captions ) .",
    "the above analysis gives the shape of a soliton for any prescribed length @xmath89,but simulation indicates that only _",
    "one _ soliton size @xmath89 is selected for any set of parameters , and its length diverges as @xmath90 approaches its critical value .",
    "looking carefully at the solutions ( [ soliton ] ) one realizes that all other possible solitons admit values for some of the @xmath91-s that are either negative or larger than one , so these options are unphysical ( negative ) or unstable to small perturbations .",
    "the actual @xmath92 may be forecasted by a rough argument based on a continuum approach . defining the local deviation from the one - zero solution , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 and plugging it into eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) gives , @xmath96 subtracting of @xmath97 from both sides and taking the continuum limit ( i.e. , assuming that the changes in @xmath98 from site to site are small compared to @xmath8 , here taken to be unity ) one gets , @xmath99 with @xmath100 goes to zero at the transition , so @xmath101 .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) that satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath102 together with @xmath103 is @xmath104 this expression fails to converge smoothly to the `` background '' ordered 010101 phase ( at x=0 it has a finite slope ) , and is also asymmetric .",
    "put it another way , there are no nontrivial heteroclinic orbits for a parabolic potential .",
    "on the other hand , close to the transition , where the size of the domain wall is large , it seems that it should fit a solution of the continuum approximation .",
    "the only way out is to pick a soliton size l such that the continuum equation admit _ no solution at all _ , i.e. , @xmath105 such a choice forces us back to the discrete equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) and its solution ( [ soliton ] ) .",
    "this argument turns out to give the right length of the stable soliton in the large @xmath89 ( @xmath106 ) limit , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "let us consider now the domain walls for the finite diffusion case . as seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , there are also solitons for the finite diffusion case , but now they admit tails that asymptotically looks like @xmath107 , and @xmath108 diverges at the transition [ e.g. , at @xmath109 for nearest neighbor interaction ] . defining a vectorial `` order parameter '' according to the larger @xmath110 values , soliton solution interpolates between @xmath111 ( larger @xmath110 on the odd sites ) to @xmath112 ( even sites ) , and its shape",
    "is given by the saddle point solution of the appropriate dynamics .",
    "although the determination of its full shape is difficult , it is possible to determine @xmath108 by linearizing around one fixed point . for small deviations , @xmath113 and @xmath114 and eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) yields the two coupled linear equations for odd and even n - s :    ) as a function of @xmath115 , ( @xmath116 ) , for a nearest - neighbor interaction without diffusion .",
    "the circles are the results of a numerical simulation and the line is @xmath117 . in the inset , the characteristic length of the soliton tail , @xmath108 ,",

    "this prediction is tested in the caption of fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) against the numerics and there is reasonable quantitative agreement , given the difficulties in getting reliable numerical accuracy for the slope of the logarithmic tail of the soliton .",
    "the model of logistic growth with long range interaction term may serve as a generic , minimal model for competition for common resource and pattern formation in excited media . in this paper",
    "this model has been analytically discussed , with two main outcomes .",
    "first , a general scheme for the identification of the pattern forming instability has been presented , along with explicit results for few common cases .",
    "second , the defected solutions for random initial conditions has been presented and analyzed , and their characteristic length that diverges at the transition is calculated .    the patterned solutions ( like the 010101 for n.n .",
    "interactions ) are stable against small perturbation ( like a low amplitude white noise ) . if instead of ... 01010101 .. one have ...",
    "01010(0.9)01 .. the 0.9 site relaxes to 1 .",
    "the domain walls , on the other hand , are much less stable , and their density and dynamics has to be strongly effected by an external noise .",
    "this is very much like the situation in magnetic system , where the response functions of the material are basically determined by the domain walls and not by the `` bulk '' . in magnetic systems , however , one may define the state of the system at finite temperature ad a minimum of the free energy function and consider the effect of noise simply as temperature increase .",
    "the situation seems to be different for the long range competition model : no simple liapunov function exist for this system , and the steady state is not derived from some variational principle . in spite of that it is plausible to assume that the defected solutions determine the response function of the segregated phase , and maybe an effective dynamical equations for the solitons may be set up to give an approximate liapunov function for this system .",
