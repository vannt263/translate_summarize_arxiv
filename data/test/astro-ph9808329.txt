    "an observation of a stellar cluster is an observation of a population of stars of the same age .",
    "x - ray observations of open clusters with various ages can thus be used to learn how the x - ray emission of stars changes as they evolve .",
    "it is found in young clusters that stars with spectral types later than f emit x - rays due to rapid rotation .",
    "as these stars age , their rotation slows down , and their x - ray emission decreases ( e.g.  caillault 1996 , randich et al . 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "an observation of m@xmath067 with rosat discovered x - rays not only from the cataclysmic variable for which the observation was intended , but also from six other member stars ( belloni et al .  1993 , hereafter bvs ) .",
    "several of these other member stars are known to be binaries , and thus belloni et al .",
    "suggested that their x - ray emission is due to rapid rotation caused by tidal interaction , i.e.  that these x - ray sources are similar to the rs cvn binaries , which are well known x - ray emitters ( e.g.  dempsey et al .  1993 ) . in the strict definition ,",
    "the rapidly rotating star in rs cvn binaries is a subgiant .",
    "if the hertzsprung russell diagram of a cluster shows a hertzsprung gap , i.e.  if the turnoff mass is higher than about 2.2@xmath2 , it is less likely to contain such rs cvn systems , as the ( sub-)giants in these clusters live shorter .",
    "this has been confirmed with x - ray observations of such clusters as ngc@xmath0752 ( belloni &  verbunt 1996 ) and ngc@xmath06940 ( belloni &  tagliaferri 1997 ) .",
    "we use a less stringent definition of rs cvn binaries , which includes chromospherically active binaries consisting of two main - sequence stars , i.e.  by draconis binaries .    in this paper",
    "we continue our study of the x - ray emission of old open clusters .",
    "we describe the results of a second , longer , x - ray observation of m@xmath067 , and of an x - ray observation of another old galactic cluster , ngc@xmath0188 .",
    "we also reanalyse our first observation of m@xmath067 , and make use of new optical studies of the binaries in this cluster to determine the nature of the x - ray sources .",
    "m@xmath067 is an ideal target for rosat , due to its proximity at about 850@xmath0pc and the low interstellar absorption at @xmath3 ( twarog &  anthony - twarog 1989 ) , which may be converted into a hydrogen column @xmath4 ( predehl &  schmitt 1995 ) .",
    "( note that these values differ from those used by bvs . )",
    "its age is estimated to be about 4@xmath0gyr ( dinescu et al .",
    "ngc@xmath0188 is at a larger distance of about 2@xmath0kpc and is reddened more at @xmath5 ( von hippel &  sarajedini 1998 ) , or @xmath6 .",

    "we observed m@xmath067 with the rosat pspc between april 25 and may 9 1993 , for a total exposure of 15771 seconds ; the center of the field of view was at 8h51m24.0s , 11@xmath749@xmath848.0@xmath9 , the center of the cluster .",
    "our previous pspc observation , obtained between 15 and 19 november 1991 , had a total exposure of 10515 seconds , and was centered at 8h50m24.0s , 11@xmath749@xmath812.0@xmath9 , about 10@xmath8 offset from the center of the cluster ( belloni et al .",
    "the data were analyzed with the exsas package ( zimmermann et al .",
    "we also re - analyzed the previous pointing , both separately and merged with the new data . since the pspc point - spread function is not well known at large off - axis angles , we limited our analysis to the central 20@xmath8 of the instrument .",
    "we followed the standard exsas detection procedure ( see e.g. bvs ) , whose final step consists of a maximum likelihood detection ( cruddace et al .",
    "1988 ) in three separate bands : total ( pha channels 11240 , 0.12.4 kev ) , soft ( ch .  1140 , 0.10.4 kev ) and hard ( ch .  41240 , 0.42.4 kev )",
    "we ran the detection procedure on the single observations , with a maximum likelihood threshold of acceptance of 13 .",
    "this value is higher than the standard value of 10 , but has been chosen on the basis of a visual inspection of the image , which also allowed us to discard obvious spurious detections .",
    "the detected sources in the three bands were crosscorrelated and , in case of a coincidence , the values of the source with the higher likelihood value have been selected for further use .",
    "this procedure led to 45 sources in the new pointing and 22 in the old one . for each pointing",
    "separately , the x - ray sources were then crosscorrelated with the entries of the hst guide star catalog ( lasker et al .",
    "1990 ) , to determine and correct for the systematic offset ( the so - called boresight correction ) between the rosat x - ray coordinates and the j2000 coordinate system .",
    "the two pointings are not coaligned , but are overlapping .",
    "thus , a lenticular region has been exposed in both observations .",
    "after having applied the boresight corrections to the single photons in the two observations , a merging was made and a new detection was performed on the lenticular region of overlap , with the same procedure described above .",
    "26 sources have been detected in this way .",
    "the three lists of x - ray sources ( old , new and merged ) were then crosscorrelated to produce the final catalog , which contains 59 sources .",
    "when a source appeared in more than one list , the detection with the highest maximum likelihood value has been selected .",
    "positions and countrates of the sources can be found in table  1 .",
    "notice that the countrates in table  1 are , like the positions , those of the best detection .",

    "we now proceed to discuss the sources according to category .",
    "source x@xmath016 is the cataclysmic variable eu cancri .",
    "this variable was discovered by gilliland et al .",
    "( 1991 ) at a photometric period of 2.09@xmath0hr .",
    "it is of the am - her type , i.e.  a binary in which a white dwarf with a strong magnetic field accretes from a low - mass main - sequence dwarf , and in which the rotation of the white dwarf is locked to the orbital revolution .",
    "eu cnc is detected with rosat only at soft energies ( channels 11 - 40 , corresponding roughly to 0.1 - 0.4@xmath0kev ) , at a countrate @xmath10cts / s .",
    "folding the x - ray data at the binary period , we obtain the lightcurve shown in fig .",
    "[ eucnc ] .",
    "the predominance of soft photons is typical for am - her type systems , as is the almost 100%  modulation of the x - ray lightcurve ( due to occultation of the x - ray emission region by the rotating white dwarf ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath11 to the optical flux also is in the range observed for am - her type systems ( see for example table  1 of verbunt et al .",
    "our observations thus confirm the suggestion by gilliand et al .",
    "( 1991 ) that this object is an am - her type system .",
    "conversion of the observed countrate to flux suffers from our ignorance of the spectrum ; for an assumed blackbody spectrum with @xmath12ev we find a bolometric x - ray luminosity for eu cnc of @xmath13 at the distance and column of m@xmath067 .",
    "x@xmath023 is a very soft source , and has been identified with a white dwarf by pasquini et al .",
    "the effective temperature of this star is @xmath14 ( fleming et al .",
    "1997 ) , which is hot enough to explain the x - ray emission . to compare its countrate with that of nearby field white dwarfs ,",

    "the values thus found are shown in fig .",

    "iii-2 of gilliland et al .",
    "the countrates are at the limit of detection .",
    "contact binaries are thought to be x - ray emitters due to chromospheric activity , induced by the rapid rotation of the stars comprising the binary .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of these two contact binaries may be compared with those of contact binaries in the field , studied by mcgale et al .",
    "the countrates of ah  cnc and s@xmath01036 are between those of e.g.  v389  oph and ak her , converted to the distance of m@xmath067 .",
    "s@xmath01036 has an orbital period slightly longer than that of ak her , which has the longest orbital period of the systems discussed by mcgale et al .",
    "a third contact binary in m@xmath067 , iii-79 , was not detected ; it is much fainter in the optical than the other two , at @xmath15 .      we detect three circular binaries at orbital periods @xmath16d .",
    "the circularity of the orbits indicates strong tidal interaction , and we expect that these systems are chromospherically active binaries ; optical spectroscopy is required to confirm this .",
    "s@xmath0999 and s@xmath01045 are double - lined spectroscopic binaries discussed by mathieu et al .",
    "s@xmath0999 @xmath17 x@xmath013 is a binary of a slightly evolved star , hence mass equal to the turnoff mass @xmath18 of m@xmath067 , and a @xmath19 main sequence companion .",

    "the larger star in rs cvn binaries is forced by the tidal interaction to corotate with the orbit , and this rapid rotation enhances the chromospheric activity , which explains the x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of the rs cvn systems in m@xmath067 is compared with those of rs cvn systems in the field in fig .",
    "[ rscvn ] . for the conversion of observed countrate to x - ray luminosity we use the two - temperature model described in sect .",
    "it is seen that the x - ray luminosities of the m@xmath067 systems are comparable to those of rs cvn systems in similar locations of the hertzsprung russell diagram .",
    "x@xmath053 is identified with s@xmath01234 .",
    "mathieu et al .  ( 1990 ) observe that s@xmath01234 is a triple system in which the primary and tertiary have roughly equal light .",
    "the period of 4.36@xmath0d is then the orbital period of the inner binary .",
    "the visible stars would have masses close to @xmath20 ; no strong constraints exist for the mass of the companion in the inner binary .",
    "the x - ray emission of s@xmath01234 is probably due to chromospheric activity in the inner binary : the inner orbital period is short enough for tidal interaction to be efficient .",
    "four binaries with as yet unknown orbital solutions have also been detected in x - rays ( x@xmath049 @xmath17 s@xmath0760 , x@xmath017 @xmath17 s@xmath0972 , x@xmath011 @xmath17 s@xmath01019 , x@xmath07 @xmath17 s@xmath01077 ) . all but s@xmath0760 appear to have orbital periods of @xmath22 days ( for s@xmath01077 see mathieu et al .",

    "x@xmath010 is identified with s@xmath01040 .",
    "s@xmath01040 was discovered to be a circular binary by mathieu et al .",
    "verbunt &  phinney ( 1995 ) showed that the giant in this binary is too small to be responsible for the orbital circularization , and concluded that the companion to the giant must be a white dwarf , whose progenitor filled its roche lobe as a giant and circularized the orbit .",
    "the companion to the giant has been detected in the ultraviolet , and its ultraviolet spectrum shows that it is indeed a white dwarf , with a temperature @xmath23k ( landsman et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the white dwarf is too cool to be responsible for the x - ray luminosity , which therefore is presumably due to chromospheric activity of the giant ( belloni et al .",
    "such activity is evident from the mg@xmath0ii@xmath242800 doublet which is in emission ( landsman et al .",
    "1997 ) , and also from ca h&k emission ( pasquini &  belloni 1998 ) .",
    "we suggest that this chromospheric activity may be a remaining effect of the phase of mass transfer in the earlier evolution of this binary .",
    "x@xmath08 and x@xmath026 are identified with s@xmath01063 and s@xmath01113 respectively .",
    "this means that both stars located below the subgiant branch in the hertzsprung russell diagram of m@xmath067 have now been detected in x - rays .",
    "s@xmath01063 is an eccentric binary with an orbital period of 18.3@xmath0d ; s@xmath01113 is a circular binary with a period of 2.82@xmath0d ( latham et al .",
    "1992 ; mathieu et al .",
    "1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "the nature of these stars , why they are located below the subgiant branch , and why they emit x - rays , is a mystery .",
    "this is all the more remarkable , as these two stars belong to the brightest x - ray sources in m@xmath067 .",
    "model computations show that the larger star in s@xmath01063 could be synchronized with the orbital motion at periastron ( van den berg et al .",
    "1998 , in preparation ) . for @xmath25",
    "this corresponds to a rotation period which is 60%  of the orbital period .",
    "the x - ray emission of s@xmath01063 ( x@xmath08 ) is variable : the countrate in november 1991 was @xmath26/ksec , that in april 1993 @xmath27/ksec .",

    "x@xmath037 and x@xmath052 have been identified with s@xmath01072 and s@xmath01237 , respectively , two long - period eccentric binaries , whose positions in the hertzsprung russell diagram could suggest that they contain evolved stars ( figs .",
    "[ xray ] ) .",
    "the colour and magnitude of s@xmath01237 can be produced by the combination of a giant branch star and a main - sequence star close to the turnoff ( janes &  smith 1984 ) .",
    "no satisfactory solution has been suggested yet to explain the magnitude and colour of s@xmath01072 ( see e.g.  mathieu et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "it is not clear to us why these three eccentric binaries emit x - rays .",
    "we do nt think that the x - ray emission is due to hot white - dwarf companions , because the x - ray spectrum is not as soft as would be expected for a white dwarf .",
    "also , the progenitor of the white dwarf would likely have circularized the orbit in its giant stage : even an orbit of several thousand days can be circularized by a white dwarf progenitor , as witnessed by s@xmath01221 ( verbunt &  phinney 1995 ) .",
    "a number of x - ray sources can be identified with stars for which there is no indication that they are binaries .",
    "it can not be excluded that these stars are chance coincidences .",
    "x@xmath043 @xmath17 s@xmath01270 and x@xmath044 @xmath17 s@xmath0775 have been observed by latham &  mathieu ; no radial velocity variation was found , so these stars are not close binaries .",

    "x@xmath035 is s@xmath0628 , located to the left of the main - sequence ; such a location can arise when a main - sequence star is accompanied by a hot white dwarf .",
    "the hardness of the x - ray spectrum argues against a hot non - accreting white dwarf .",
    "perhaps s@xmath0628 is a cataclysmic variable .",
    "it should be noted that its membership probability is only 69% ; if it is at larger distance than m@xmath067 ( to be at or above the main sequence it has to be @xmath28 times the distance of m@xmath067 ) , its x - ray luminosity is accordingly higher .",
    "x@xmath04 is the blue straggler s@xmath01082 .",
    "this has been suggested to be in a binary with a sdo companion on the basis of a large ultraviolet excess with respect to the spectrum derived from strmgren photometry ( landsman et al .",
    ". a binary period of approximately 1 day has been suggested from optical photometry ( goranskij et al .",
    "1992 ) ; however , the large velocity variations implied by such a short period have not been found by mathieu et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , even though they note that the dispersion in their velocities for this star is somewhat larger than normal .",
    "the larger dispersion may be due to the early spectral type .",
    "x@xmath019 is s@xmath0364 , close to the location of the mira variables in the hertzsprung russell diagram .",
    "no chromospheric emission is present in s@xmath0364 ( pasquini &  belloni 1998 ) .",
    "x@xmath025 is identified with hd  75638 .",
    "this star is a triple star , with an inner orbit of 5.8@xmath0d and zero eccentricity ( nordstrm et al .",
    "the x - ray luminosity suggests that the inner binary is a rs cvn system .",
    "x@xmath042 shows a flare in the last 2800@xmath0s of our observations , during which the countrate was 0.03 cts / s , which is about ten times higher than the average countrate before .",
    "such a flare suggests that s@xmath01042 may be a late main - sequence star ; its colour and magnitude are compatible with a k dwarf at the distance of m@xmath067 .",

    "thus the x - ray emission at @xmath31 is likely due to chromospheric activity .",

    "many of these are more or less expected source types , such as the cataclysmic variable , the hot white dwarf , the contact binaries , and the circular short - period binaries : for all of these the x - ray luminosity is in the range found for similar sources in the galactic disk .",
