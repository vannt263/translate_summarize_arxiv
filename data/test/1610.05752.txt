    "the early spectra are characterized by the presence of strong absorption lines of si ; the intermediate - mass elements such as ca , s , mg , and o ; and the fe - peak elements fe , ni , and co @xcite . the late - time spectra show emission lines of fe - peak elements , which include those of stable ni , i.e. , neutron - rich @xmath6ni .",
    "it is thus evident that the light curves and spectra are closely related to the nucleosynthesis , which is crucial to study the unresolved issues regarding the explosion models and the progenitors of sne ia .",
    "explosive nucleosynthesis calculations in both the chandra and sub - chandra models predict the production of reasonable amounts of fe - peak elements and intermediate mass elements ( ca , s , si , mg , o ) . in the inner parts of the wd , temperatures behind the deflagration or detonation wave exceed @xmath7 k , so that the reactions are rapid enough to synthesize mainly @xmath5ni . in the surrounding parts with lower densities and temperatures ,",
    "explosive burning produces the intermediate mass elements si , s , ar , ca . both models are successful in producing the basic features of sn ia light curves and spectra .",
    "this implies that it is difficult to distinguish these models .    however , the synthesized amounts of some neutron - rich species , such as @xmath6ni , @xmath8fe , and @xmath9mn relative to @xmath5fe differ between the chandra and sub - chandra models because of the difference in the central densities of the wds @xcite .      in the chandra models ,",
    "the central densities of the wds are high enough that the fermi energy of electrons tends to exceed the energy thresholds of the electron captures involved .",

    "the detailed abundance ratios with respect to @xmath5ni ( or @xmath5fe ) depend on the convective flame speed and the central densities ( e.g. , @xcite for rotating wd models ) , which must be studied in multi - d hydrodynamical simulations .    on the other hand , the sub - chandra models undergo little electron capture , so that the amount of stable ni is much smaller .",

    "it is important to accurately predict the electron capture rates relevant to nucleosynthesis in sne ia .",

    "* ) have constrained sn ia nucleosynthesis in attempts to accurately predict the abundance ratios of fe - peak nuclei .",
    "these `` second generation '' results have greatly improved upon earlier nucleosynthesis predictions @xcite .    the current push in describing sn ia nucleosynthesis is towards reducing the uncertainty in the yields while also attempting to replicate experimental results which are now made possible by improved techniques ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "work in this direction will provide not only convergence in nuclear models towards an accurate description of weak rates , but also a measure of the sensitivity of sn ia models to the nuclear physics inputs .",
    "because of their relevance to sne ia , the gt strengths of pf - shell nuclei have undergone significant experimentatal investigations over the past several years .",
    "various techniques have been employed to extract the gt strengths in the pf - shell nuclei .",
    "a compilation of gt measurements of many of the pf - shell nuclei with 45@xmath15 was performed by @xcite .",
    "this study includes studies of @xmath16-decay results @xcite , charge exchange results using ( n , p ) reactions @xcite , charge - exchange results using ( d,@xmath17he ) reactions @xcite , charge - exchange results using ( t,@xmath18he ) reactions , and charge - exchange results using ( p , n ) reactions assuming isospin symmetry @xcite .",
    "in addition to experimental work , there has been theoretical interest in computing gt strengths . in nuclear reaction networks , the commonly - used kbf model @xcite is often employed to generate ec rates .",
    "the kb3 g and kbf rates are generally the standards used in nucleosynthesis calculations @xcite and have been for over a decade .",
    "however , more recent models have been proposed , including the gxp - type shell model family @xcite .",
    "these two models have been found to produce gt strength distributions which are in disagreement , resulting in potentially different ec rates , and thus possible different nucleosynthetic yields in sne ia .",
    "which model is correct is the subject of the aforementioned experimentation .    as an example , recent measurements of the gt transition strength distributions for the @xmath5ni@xmath19cu and the @xmath9co@xmath20ni transitions @xcite are helpful in constraining nuclear shell models . using the ( p , n ) charge - exchange reaction , the strengths were measured with a good degree of accuracy over a very wide range of excitation energies . here , isospin",
    "symmetry - breaking effects are neglected , and the experimentally extracted gt strengths for @xmath5ni@xmath21cu can be applied to electron capture ( ec ) and @xmath22 decays of @xmath5ni @xcite .",
    "it was found that the transition strengths for these two transitions more closely match those computed with the gxpf1j shell - model interaction @xcite than those computed with the kb3 g or the kbf models @xcite .",
    "these experimental and theoretical results suggest that actual ec rates may differ from those predicted by the kbf - family shell model calculations",
    ". a reduction of the ec rates may be responsible for an overall enhancement in @xmath10 and a concurrent change in production of @xmath5ni in sne ia .",
    "the effect may be magnified if all nuclei in the pf - shell region are considered . here",
    ", strength calculations result in ec rates that are lower for many pf - shell nuclei ( for @xmath23 g  @xmath3 ) @xcite . however ,",
    "depending on the temperature and @xmath24 of the medium , rates may increase or decrease as different parts of the gt strength function are integrated over .",
    "while decreases in ec rates may change the production of @xmath5ni in sne ia , increased rates can not be ruled out from the data .",
    "this was verified by @xcite , who found no systematic shift in rates if one shell model is used over another .",
    "depending on the shell model , strengths may be higher or lower for different thermal conditions .",
    "this concept will be discussed later in this paper .",
    "the effects of the gxp - type shell model on proton - rich pf - shell nuclei with 23@xmath25z@xmath2530 are studied as they influence nucleosynthesis in sne ia . here , we examine both stable and unstable nuclei in this region . in particular , the effect on @xmath10 as well as production ratios are evaluated .",
    "mass fractions of nuclei produced in sne ia are compared using both gxp parametrizations and kbf models .",
    "trajectories of mass shells in a wd are used as input into a nuclear reaction network to gauge the effects of variations in nuclear physics inputs , and final nuclear mass fractions in individual shells are computed .",
    "because of computational limitations , the explosion calculation is decoupled from the nuclear reaction network",
    ". however , the effects of the nuclear shell model used are evident in the resultant electron fractions and the final mass fractions .",
    "comparisons to solar values indicate that the enhancement in @xmath10 , which arises from using the gxp - type model , reduces the overall @xmath6ni/@xmath5ni and @xmath6ni/@xmath5fe ratios , which has been an interesting problem addressed by prior evaluations @xcite .",
    "a brief overview of the gxp shell model calculation is presented in  [ shell_calcs ] along with a comparison to kbf rates .",
    "next , the nuclear reaction network calculations and the insertion of the gxp rates are presented .",
    "results , including produced mass fractions are compared in  [ results ] ; these results using the gxp shell model are compared to results using the kbf rates as well as solar mass fractions .",
    "finally , conclusions , discussion , and future prospects are presented .",
    "the gxpf1j hamiltonian @xcite was modified from the original gxpf1 hamiltonian @xcite , which was obtained by fitting experimental energy data of a wide range of pf - shell nuclei with mass number @xmath26 .",
    "new experimental data of neutron - rich ca , ti and cr isotopes with @xmath27 32 were taken into account to improve the gxpf1j model .",
    "this model was further modified to reproduce the peak position of the m1 strength in @xmath28ca .",
    "the kbf and kb3 g give energies for the 1@xmath29 state about 1 mev below the experimental value . in the kb3 g model the m1 strength is split into two states .",
    "the m1 strengths in @xmath30ti , @xmath31cr and @xmath8fe as well as the gt strength in @xmath6ni are found to be well reproduced by gxpf1j with the use of the quenching factors , @xmath32/@xmath33 = 0.75 @xcite and @xmath34/@xmath35 = 0.74 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the shell - model calculations are carried out with the code mshell @xcite , allowing at most five nucleons to be excited from the @xmath36 orbit .",
    "the gt strength distributions are obtained by following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the gt strength functions for @xmath5ni@xmath37cu and @xmath8fe@xmath38mn are shown in figure [ gtni56a_strength ] for several shell model calculations compared to experimentally determined values @xcite for @xmath5ni . for the intermediate excitation energy range at @xmath394 mev for",
    "the @xmath5ni reaction , b(gt ) drops in the experiment and in the gxpf1j model .",
    "however , this decrease does not appear for the kbf and kb3 g models .",
    "the net result is an expected decrease in the ec rate on @xmath5ni . while the gxpf1j results are not as low at @xmath404 mev as the experimental results , the trend in this model is similar to that of the experimental results at this energy .    at higher energies ( @xmath414 mev )",
    ", however , the value of b(gt ) for the gxpf1j model exceeds those predicted by the kbf and kb3 g models .",
    "this crossover ( indicated by the vertical lines in figure [ gtni56a_strength ] ) above 4 mev may be less significant as one convolves the strengths with the fermi function and the electron energy distribution .",
    "overall , the ec rates are expected to be lower for the gxpf1j model for a high - enough temperature .    for the @xmath8fe reaction ,",
    "the drop in b(gt ) at @xmath42 4 mev is less apparent depending on which kb parametrization is used . for the kb3 g model , the the strength function for gxp is lower at @xmath42 3 mev , and higher above this crossover energy .",
    "the gxp and kbf parametrizations are similar with a few deviations .",
    "also shown in figure [ gtni56a_strength ] are the strength functions for electron captures from the first excited state of the parent nucleus .",
    "these will be discussed in a later section .",
    "the ec rates of pf - shell nuclei are evaluated for gxpf1j by including contributions from all the excited states of parent nuclei up to @xmath43 = 2 mev .",
    "the resultant ec rates for @xmath5ni are shown as a function of temperature and @xmath24 in figure [ ni56rates ] comparing the gxpf1j , kbf , and kb3 g models . here",
    "as expected , the kb3 g model produces the highest rates overall at high temperatures and @xmath24 .",
    "the difference between the kbf and the gxpf1j rates is smaller - a difference of about 10% in most cases . at higher temperatures",
    ", the difference between the kbf and gxpf1j rates diminishes .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that at higher temperatures , the spread in electron energies is higher as the fermi function has a larger effective range .",
    "the integration of the rates over the larger span in electron energies results in an integration over a larger effective range of energies in b(gt ) .",
    "this integration would include the region where b(gt)@xmath45b(gt)@xmath46 and the region where b(gt)@xmath47b(gt)@xmath46 .",
    "these two effects would counteract each other .",
    "a comparison of the reaction rates for the @xmath5ni ec reaction is shown in figure [ gtni56a_ratio ] . here",
    ", we take the ratio of several rate determinations to those of the kbf rates .",
    "several shell model calculations for two temperatures as a function of @xmath24 are employed .",
    "it can be seen that the differences between a chosen shell model and the kbf are largest at low @xmath24 .",
    "it is also noted that at higher temperatures , the rates in all models converge , as the electron energy distribution is integrated over a larger portion of b(gt ) .",
    "however , while the kb3 g rates are larger than the kbf rates at low @xmath10 by as much as @xmath39 60% , the enhancement in rates for the gxp model is only about 10% , precluding a potentially small effect on ni production in sne ia .",
    "it is also noted from figure [ gtni56a_strength ] that the experimentally determined gt strengths for @xmath5ni@xmath19cu exceed those determined using the gxpf1j and kbf models slightly for the energy range 1.5 @xmath482.5 mev .",
    "this region may be important for the production of @xmath5ni in snia as the temperature drops significantly at this stage of the nucleosynthesis .",
    "a possible increase in ec rates for @xmath5ni can not be ruled out from the experimental data .",
    "this point is further exemplified in figure [ ecapratio ] . here ,",
    "the ratio of gxp rates to kbf rates , @xmath49 are shown for 11 nuclei considered in @xcite .",
    "this evaluation was performed for @xmath50 and @xmath51 g  @xmath3 . from here , no systematic trend is determined as the relationship between nuclear structure and the thermodynamic environment of a sn ia is complex .",
    "the ratios are within 0.4 - 2.4 , which shows that the e - capture gxp and kbf rates are close to each other - within a factor of 2.5 .",
    "this is also true for ga ( z=31 ) and ge ( z=32 ) .",
    "effects from the use of the gxpf1j model for nuclei with z=31 and 32 and 23@xmath5230 are , therefore , expected to be modest at best .",
    "to evaluate the effects of changes in capture rates on sn ia nucleosynthesis , the two - dimensional electron - capture ( ec ) rates as a function of @xmath24 and temperature have been determined based on the gt strength functions to produce two nuclear reaction networks .",
    "the nuclear reaction networks used are summarized in table [ network_list ] .",
    "two different rate tables were used in combination with two different sn ia explosion scenarios modeled by their hydrodynamic trajectories .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      given the temperatures of the environments of sne ia , it is conceivable that nuclei in their excited states may result in reaction rates that vary from the ground - state rates . for this reason ,",
    "it is worth mentioning the contribution to the ec rates for a few cases of nuclei in their excited states .    in figure",
    "[ gtni56a_strength ] , the gt strength functions are shown in the gxp shell model for the first excited states of @xmath5ni and @xmath8fe , and the integrated strengths are shown in figure [ sumgt ] . in both cases , the first excited state of the parent nucleus is the 2@xmath53 state . in each case , the strength function shifts to higher excitation energy .",
    "the shift of the strength from the excited 2@xmath53 states can be understood as a manifestation of the brink hypothesis , which is primarily applicable to giant dipole resonances and can be applied to gt strength distributions .",
    "this hypothesis states that the giant dipole resonances ( as well as the gt strengths ) reside at the same energies relative to excited states as in the ground state @xcite .",
    "while not exact , it can be used to understand the shift in the gt strengths in figure [ gtni56a_strength ] .",
    "details concerning the applicability of the brink hypothesis have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the applicability of the brink hypothesis for m1 strength functions are presented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "thus , the shift of the strength function is commensurate with the excitation energy of the parent nucleus . in the case of sne",
    "ia nucleosynthesis , this shift would likely not change the resultant nucleosynthesis .",
    "this is because the excited states of the parent nuclei , the 2@xmath53 state in both @xmath5ni and @xmath8fe , are at 2.7 mev and 1.4 mev respectively . at the temperatures of the type ia sn environment ,",
    "these states are not expected to have a significant population , and can be dismissed as possible contributors to the strength distributions .",
    "we continue the current effort in modern nuclear astrophysics towards a more accurate description of sn ia nucleosynthesis using gt strength functions which more closely match experimental results .",
    "recent measurements of the gt strength distributions - used in determining ec rates - of pf - shell nuclei have called into question the validity of the theoretical distributions , which are important in determining nucleosynthesis in sne ia @xcite .",
    "a comparison was made between the gt strength functions b(gt ) of the commonly used kbf model @xcite and the gxp models @xcite .",
    "it was found that the gxp shell model more closely matches the experimental b(gt ) for @xmath5ni @xcite .    using these strength distributions to determine ec rates for the pf - shell nuclei with 23@xmath5430 , nucleosynthesis in a type ia sn was calculated using the thermodynamic trajectories of the deflagration model w7 @xcite and the delayed - detonation model wdd2 @xcite .",
    "comparisons of production were made between the w7 and wdd2 models for rates computed using the gxp and kbf shell model parametrizations .    while the gxp shell model results in rates which tend to shift the resultant nucleosynthesis to higher @xmath10 , thus increasing the ni / fe ratio , this shift is small , changing yields in the pf - shell region by only a few percent at best .",
    "even though b(gt ) is dramatically different in each shell model calculation , resulting in potentially significant rate changes as shown in figure [ ec_rate ] , the overall change in rates is also a function of the electron fermi distribution , which depends on the environmental temperature . by the time the nucleosynthesis reaches the pf - shell nuclei ,",
    "the temperature is low enough that the electron fermi energy is about 1.5 mev . integrating over b(gt ) in figure [ gtni56a_strength ]",
    "( while also taking the ec q - value into account ) results in a very small difference between the resultant rates since the integration is only over small transition energies , and the values of @xmath43 reached in the gt strength distributions are small , where the deviation between shell models is insignificant .",
    "excited states for @xmath5ni and @xmath8fe have also been investigated , with a corresponding shift in the gt strength distribution .",
    "nuclei in excited states may shift the ec q - values , and the shift in the gt strengths ( a manifestation of the brink - axel hypothesis ) may result in a slight reduction of the ec rates . however , it is noted that the excited states of doubly - magic @xmath5ni and singly - magic @xmath8fe in this regime are high enough that there will likely be little population of these states in a sn ia .",
    "this should be studied in greater detail , however , as odd - a or odd - odd nuclei may have lower excited states with more significant populations in sne ia .",
    "it s also worth noting that because the gxp model is developed for pf - shell nuclei , application of a shell model with interactions which give different gt strengths to nuclei of lower mass , where the temperature of the sn ia environment is hotter , may result in more significant changes in the nucleosynthesis . while type ii supernovae are primarily responsible for production of these elements , sne ia are responsible for some of their production as well @xcite . if the significant differences between the kbf and gxp models are at higher energies as suggested by the studies of @xmath5ni and @xmath8fe , then low - mass nuclei may exhibit a more pronounced change in abundance as they are produced earlier in the nucleosynthesis when the temperatures are hotter .",
    "finally , the importance of @xmath8cr as a signature of the nucleosynthesis within the innermost mass shell is mentioned .",
    "this nucleus , with a z / a=0.44 , is one of the more proton - rich nuclei produced in the network calculations . as such",
    ", it is only produced in any significant abundance in the mass shells that have the lowest @xmath10 distributions . however ,",
    "if the @xmath10 distribution is shifted globally over the entire star , then the production of @xmath8cr may be altered dramatically . any change to the central mass element ( with the lowest @xmath10 ) could have relatively large effects on the global production of @xmath8cr .",
    "it may be worthwhile to examine this nucleus in greater detail and its sensitivity to the nuclear physics and stellar physics inputs .",
    "in addition to @xmath8cr , it may be worthwhile to investigate @xmath55co and @xmath9fe as signatures of the chandra and sub - chandra models .",
    "recently , astronomers have detected radioactivity from @xmath55co and @xmath9fe @xcite .",
    "if these can be shown to be sensitive to the central density , then verifications from astronomical observations may help to constrain the actual model used .",
    "it is noted that corrections to ec rates for pf - shell nuclei relevant to sne ia using different nuclear shell models have resulted in smaller relative effects in the overall nucleosynthesis with historical changes decreasing with newer nuclear models .",
    "because uncertainties in the nuclear physics are now apparently small , reducing the uncertainties in the stellar physics may provide larger corrections in the nucleosynthesis computations .",
    "perhaps foremost among these would include an investigation of sne ia explosions in three dimensions .",
    "also a systematic evaluation of the sensitivity of nuclear production to the uncertainties in the explosion may be worth pursuing .",
    "one example of such an exploration is the recent models in which the wd rotation is taken into account @xcite . in these models the central density is predicted to have a large variation and thus synthesis of neutron - rich fe peak elements may be strongly affected .",
    "this also suggests the general importance of accurate electron capture rates for various conditions .",
    "of course , uncertainties in nuclear physics relevant to other astrophysical scenarios , such as neutron - star crusts and type ii supernovae , remain significant .",

    "<S> recent experimental results have confirmed a possible reduction in the gt@xmath0 strengths of pf - shell nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> these proton - rich nuclei are of relevance in the deflagration and explosive burning phases of type ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> while prior gt strengths result in nucleosynthesis predictions with a lower - than - expected electron fraction , a reduction in the gt@xmath0 strength can result in an slightly increased electron fraction compared to previous shell model predictions , though the enhancement is not as large as previous enhancements in going from rates computed by fuller , fowler , and newman based on an independent particle model . </S>",
    "<S> a shell model parametrization has been developed which more closely matches experimental gt strengths . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant electron - capture rates are used in nucleosynthesis calculations for carbon deflagration and explosion phases of type ia supernovae , and the final mass fractions are compared to those obtained using more commonly - used rates . </S>"
