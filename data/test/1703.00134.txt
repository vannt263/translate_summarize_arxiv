    "communication resources are scarce relative to the data requirements of the system users . a multiaccess communication scheme is needed to control the sharing of these resources among the different users .",
    "if a scheme allows several transmitters to communicate with the same receiver using the same resources , the scheme incurs collisions and retransmissions become necessary .",
    "in addition , if a scheme allows several transmitters to communicate with distinct receivers but a signal targeted to one receiver suffers from interference of signals targeted to others , this signal gets deteriorated and its decoding incurs errors if feasible in the first place . in both many - to - one and many - to - many communication scenarios , one category of schemes regulates multiaccess communication by preventing collisions and non - negligible interference .",
    "the other category advises collision - resolution protocols and signal - decoding algorithms in presence of interference .",
    "+ time and frequency division multiple access ( tdma and fdma ) are two conflict - free multiaccess schemes .",
    "a major drawback of both schemes is that only a portion of the available resources ( time and frequency ) is utilized when the network is lightly loaded while the other portion remains idle .",
    "code division multiple access ( cdma ) is another scheme that orthogonalizes the channel access via use of codes . yet",
    "it is interference - limited in practice  @xcite . on the other hand , slotted aloha , carrier sense multiple access(csma ) , and csma with collision detection and collision avoidance ( csma / cd and csma / ca ) are contention - based protocols",
    ". transmitters with data compete to access the channel after random waiting periods while bearing the risk of collisions .",
    "this access mode is useful to accommodate variable bit rate data streams but is less efficient in heavily loaded networks .",
    "csma / cd is used in ethernet and achieves a throughput of @xmath1 .",
    "it can be shown that an upper bound on the throughput of any collision resolution algorithm is @xmath2 . among other assumptions ,",
    "this upper bound holds true for the case where all packets involved in a collision should be retransmitted  @xcite .",
    "a throughput of @xmath3 is achieved using a tree algorithm for collision resolution  @xcite .",
    "+ interference alignment , first introduced in  @xcite , is a recent interference management technique that is neither resource - reservation - based nor contention - based .",
    "instead , each transmitter steers its signal so that it lies within a reduced subspace along other interfering signals at every receiver except its desired receiver .",
    "each receiver then looks outside its interference subspace and is able to extract the desired signal . for the fully connected @xmath4 user time - varying interference channel and",
    "assuming global channel knowledge , the authors in  @xcite show that this channel has @xmath5 degrees of freedom which is a @xmath0 throughput . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the feasibility of interference alignment given only local channel state information ( csi ) at each node .",
    "practical challenges for interference alignment are described in  @xcite .",
    "also , interference alignment is not designed for the many - to - one communication scenario since if all the transmitted signals need to be decoded by a receiver , no two signals may be aligned with respect to that receiver .",
    "+ in this paper we describe an algorithm that works in both the many - to - one and many - to - many communication scenarios .",
    "having said that , a receiver manages collisions and interference by decoding the collided packets and the interfering signals . here",
    "we overlook security or privacy concerns whenever the decoder is not the target receiver .",
    "the channel is assumed packet - switched so that we avoid the inefficiencies of resource reservation under low load .",
    "in addition , while interference alignment and best collision resolution algorithms achieve a @xmath0 throughput , our algorithm asymptotically utilizes the full capacity of the network when the number of users grows infinite , provided that any communication ( desired and undesired ) between the transmitters and the receiver(s ) is synchronized and the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is high . if the synchronization requirement can not be met , the asymptotic performance is still @xmath0 in the worst case .",
    "+ we take a different perspective than interference alignment . in interference alignment , each receiver looks at its own space uniquely : its desired signal lies in half the space while all the other signals lie in the second half .",
    "the split is thus unique to every receiver .",
    "since the transmitters have to steer their signals so that they get aligned as desired by the receivers , they become over - constrained and the steering achieves only @xmath0 efficiency .",
    "however , we let the receivers have a unified view of the signal space",
    ". this does not mean cooperation among the transmitters or the receivers .",
    "instead , all the receivers view the space as two orthogonal subspaces : one subspace that holds all the signals and noise , and another subspace that holds only noise .",
    "the first subspace has dimensionality of the order of the number of transmitted signals . under perfect synchronization",
    "this is exactly the number of transmitters .",
    "the second subspace has enough dimensions to suppress noise .",
    "this could be single - dimensional for high snr .",
    "we choose the steering vectors to uniquely identify each transmitter .",
    "since the number of dimensions occupied by the transmitted signals always grows as their number increases , the problem is no more overconstrained and every transmitted signal can be decoded by every receiver . if an arriving signal is so weak , a receiver can always decide that this is an interfering signal and move the occupied dimension(s ) to the noise subspace .",
    "+ we select the same steering vectors as those of the root - music algorithm used in  @xcite to estimate the signal direction of arrival in an array antenna system . for our algorithm , since these vectors lie in a high dimensional subspace , it is indifferent whether the extension over the dimensions occurs in time , frequency or space . in this paper",
    "we assume the channel is a single carrier and every node has a single antenna , so the steering vectors extend over time .",
    "this paper is focused on describing the algorithm .",
    "network performance analysis and optimizations on the functionality of the algorithm will be excluded .",
    "the algorithm is defined incrementally over sections  [ sec3 ] to  [ sec8 ] , where each increment considers a more general or realistic setting .",
    "we first present the system model .",
    "[ sec2 ] consider a single - carrier system in which @xmath4 transmitters contact a single receiver , each node having a single antenna .",
    "each transmitter accesses the channel whenever data is available without waiting for the channel to be idle .",
    "we assume there is only a single receiver because a receiver is able to decode all arriving signals without cooperation with other receivers .",
    "thus in a system with more than one receiver , they all perform the same functionality .",
    "obviously each receiver will be able to only decode its unique set of arriving signals , whether desired or not .",
    "the minimum transmission unit is a packet with @xmath6 symbols that could be real or complex .",
    "it takes one time slot to transmit a single packet .",
    "a symbol duration is @xmath7 seconds , so @xmath8 .",
    "we are interested in the case where @xmath9 . for @xmath10",
    ", we assume that the transmitter identifies immediately upon sending the packet that there were no concurrent transmissions and there is no need for further action .",
    "this could be through immediate feedback or simply the transmitter can sense the channel .",
    "this assumption is not absolutely necessary nor critical for the network asymptotic throughput but is made for simplicity .",
    "note that a feedback from the receiver is only possible if the packet has extra bits for error detection .",
    "we refer to these bits as crc for cyclic redundancy check .",
    "+ on the other hand , if there are concurrent transmissions , each transmitter will send its packet more than once before the receiver can decode these individual packets . during this time",
    ", some new transmitters might join and start sending new packets .",
    "the receiver in turn will need more time to decode all the received packets .",
    "in such a scenario , @xmath4 refers to the total number of transmitters at the instant of successful decoding , which is greater than or equal to the number of transmitters upon arrival of the first few packets .",
    "the time for successful decoding is measured in slots and is equal to @xmath11 .",
    "this will be function of @xmath4 , the snr and the complexity of the communication scenario ( like when each transmitter joined the set of active transmitters ) .",
    "we will not consider the impact of the last factor on @xmath11 in this paper and assume that the receiver has high processing capabilities .",
    "we also assume that the receiver will try to minimize @xmath11 and in a sense also minimize @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , if there is a single transmission in time slot 1 and another transmission from a different receiver in time slot 2 , the receiver will detect these two transmissions as two separate scenarios , each with @xmath12 and @xmath10 .",
