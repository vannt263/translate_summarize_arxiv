    "kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite is a computational quantum mechanical modeling method used to investigate the electronic structure of many - body systems ( atoms , molecules , and solids ) . in this theory ,",
    "the ground - state energy of a many - electron system is determined by minimizing a functional of the spatially - dependent electron density rather than searching for the many - body wavefunction .",
    "although the exact energy functional has not been determined , approximate models for the functional have yielded accurate predictions for many classes of materials .",
    "dft has thus become one of the most widely used methods in electronic structure calculations  @xcite .",
    "the minimization problem of dft can be recast into the solution of an effective one - electron - type schrdinger equation , the so - called kohn - sham equation , by introducing an effective potential .",
    "the ks equation is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem since the effective potential is a functional of the density .",
    "it is usually dealt with using a self - consistent field ( scf ) approach @xcite .    in practical implementations ,",
    "the single - electron wavefunctions need to be expanded in terms of some set of mathematical basis functions .",
    "the coefficients of the functions in this basis set are the primary values used to build a computational representation . for periodic solids , several different basis sets",
    "have been developed among which plane waves , the focus of the present paper .",
    "though it has a few drawbacks , this approach has many advantages which make it very popular in materials science and physics .",
    "various electronic structure calculation packages ( such as vasp  @xcite , quantum espresso  @xcite , abinit  @xcite , ... ) rely on it .    in general ,",
    "a very large number of plane waves are needed to approximate the wave functions .",
    "so a large scale linear eigenvalue problem needs to be solved repeatedly after linearization by the scf method . due to the use fast fourier transform ( which has contributed to the success of this approach ) ,",
    "large scale parallelization is hard to achieve for the plane - wave method .",
    "besides , the solution for the large scale eigenvalue problems requires large scale orthogonal operation and orthogonality needs global operations , which is also the bottleneck of the large scale parallelization .",
    "various methods have been proposed for solving the associated eigenvalue problems .",
    "the davidson iterative diagonalization @xcite , which reduces to a dense matrix diagonalization , is also hard to parallelize efficiently .",
    "the conjugate - gradient - like band - by - band diagonalization @xcite , which uses less memory and is more robust , is inherently sequential .",
    "it is actually quite challenging to improve parallel efficiency of plane - wave dft codes on today s supercomputer platforms . in this paper , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we propose some parallel orbital - updating based plane - wave basis methods for solving the kohn - sham equation , which improve the scalability of parallelization . in our approach , the solution of the eigenvalue problem is replaced by the solution of a series of independent source problems and some small scale eigenvalue problems . because of the independence of the source problems , these source problems can be solved in parallel essentially . for each source problem , the traditional parallel strategies ( for example , domain decomposition or parallelization in matrix - vector multiplication ) can be used to deal with it in parallel .",
    "therefore , our new methods allow for a two - level parallelization : one level of parallelization is obtained by partitioning these source problems into different groups of processors , another level of parallelization is obtained by assigning each source problem to several processors contained in each group .",
    "this two - level parallelization makes our new methods more competitive for the large scale calculations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we provide some preliminaries for the kohn - sham equation , the plane - wave discretization , and scf iteration .",
    "then , we propose our new parallel orbital - updating based plane - wave basis methods .",
    "next , we implement our algorithms in the software package quantum espresso , and use some numerical experiments to show the efficiency of our new methods .",
    "finally , we give some concluding remarks .",
    "according to the basic principles of quantum mechanics , the physical properties of a system of @xmath0 interacting electrons in an external potential @xmath1 can be obtained by solving the time - independent schrdinger equation : @xmath2 \\psi(\\mathbf{r}_1 , \\ldots , \\mathbf{r}_n ) =   e^\\mathrm{el}_n \\psi(\\mathbf{r}_1 , \\ldots , \\mathbf{r}_n),\\ ] ] where @xmath3 are the coordinates of the electrons @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the total electronic energy of the eigenstate @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the electronic wave function .",
    "atomic units are used throughout this work @xmath8 .",
    "typically , the external potential can be the one due to @xmath9 nuclei in which case : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the charges and the positions of the nuclei @xmath13 .",
    "dft provides a way to systematically map the many - body ( interacting electrons ) problem onto a single - body problem ( fictiously non - interacting electrons ) in an effective potential @xmath14 in order to determine the ground - state energy @xmath15 by expressing it as a functional of the electronic density : @xmath16    basically , one needs to solve the so - called kohn - sham equation .",
    "the kohn - sham equation of a system consisting of @xmath9 nuclei of charges and @xmath0 electrons is the following nonlinear eigenvalue problem @xmath17    @xmath18    where @xmath0 is the number of electrons , @xmath19 is the electron density , @xmath20 is the hartree potential , @xmath21 is the exchange - correlation potential and @xmath22 , defined by , is the external potential due to the nuclei .",
    "the ground - state energy of the system of @xmath0 electrons is given by : @xmath23+\\int v_\\mathrm{ext}(\\mathbf{r } ) \\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\;d\\mathbf{r } + e_\\mathrm{h}[\\rho ] + e_\\mathrm{xc}[\\rho].\\ ] ] the kinetic energy @xmath24 $ ] is defined by @xmath25= \\sum_{i=1}^{n } -\\frac{1}{2 } \\int \\psi^*_i(\\mathbf{r})\\delta \\psi_i(\\mathbf{r})\\;d\\mathbf{r},\\ ] ] which is not the true kinetic energy of the system of interacting electrons .",
    "the hartree energy @xmath26 $ ] is given by : @xmath27 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\rho(\\mathbf{r}')}{|\\mathbf{r}'-\\mathbf{r}|}\\;d\\mathbf{r}d\\mathbf{r}'.\\ ] ] dft is exact in principle , however , the exchange - correlation functional @xmath28 $ ] as well as @xmath29(\\mathbf{r})$ ] are not known and must be approximated .",
    "we implement the variational method in to get the weak formulation of kohn - sham equation : find @xmath30 , @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 where @xmath33    from the density functional theory , we know that the ground state of the system can be obtained by solving the lowest @xmath0 pairs of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the kohn - sham equation .",
    "we now consider the periodic boundary conditions in a large volume @xmath34 that is allowed to go to infinity . in periodic solids ,",
    "there is an infinite number of non - interacting electrons moving in an infinite external potential ( such as the one generated by an infinite number of nuclei ) .",
    "however , bloch s theorem @xcite can be invoked to express the wavefunction as the product of a cell - periodic part and wavelike part , whose wavevector is drawn from the first brillouin zone ( bz ) of the reciprocal lattice : @xmath35,\\ ] ] with @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the lattice vectors .",
    "the infinite number of electrons in the solid is thus accounted for by an infinite number of @xmath38 points in the bz , and only a finite number of electronic states are occupied at each @xmath38 point .",
    "for instance , the electronic density is given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of occupied states .",
    "furthermore , the electronic wavefunctions at @xmath38 points that are very close will be very similar .",
    "hence , it is possible to represent the electronic wavefunctions over a region of the bz by the wavefunctions at a single @xmath38 point .",
    "this can be exploited for replacing integrals over the bz by a weighted sum on a discrete mesh of well - chosen @xmath38 points .",
    "for instance , the one for the electronic density becomes : @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the weights associated to the special @xmath38-points @xmath43 with @xmath44 . in the case of an homogeneous mesh ,",
    "all the weights are equal and given by @xmath45 .",
    "the accuracy of the calculations can always be increased by using a denser set of special @xmath38-points . in semiconductors ,",
    "a modest number is sufficient to achieve a well - converged sampling density because of the smoothly varying nature of ks states in @xmath38-space . in metals , however , much denser grids are required due to the abrupt change in the occupancy of each state with the wavevector @xmath38 .",
    "the cell - periodic part of the wavefunctions can conveniently be represented as an expansion in terms of some set of mathematical basis functions .",
    "the coefficients of the functions in this basis set are then the primary values used to build a computational representation .",
    "many different basis sets have been developed for use in periodic solid - state calculations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description ) .",
    "the most natural ( due to the periodicity ) and popular ( due to its ease of use ) is the plane - wave basis set .",
    "each function @xmath46 is expressed as a fourier series whose basis states are plane waves whose wavevector is a reciprocal lattice vector @xmath47 ( which are defined by @xmath48 ) : @xmath49.\\ ] ]    so a wave function can be written as @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 are the expansion coefficients of the wave function .    due to the fact that the coefficients @xmath51 for the plane waves with small kinetic energy @xmath52 are typically more important than those with large kinetic energy @xcite , the plane - wave basis set can be truncated to include only plane waves that have kinetic energies less than some particular cutoff energy @xmath53 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath54    the plane waves form an orthonormal basis set and do not depend on the location of the nuclei which simplifies the form of the equations and their implementation .",
    "furthermore , the size of the basis set ( and therefore the accuracy of the calculations ) can be systematically increased and easily controlled by a single parameter , the cut - off energy @xmath53 @xcite , retaining only those @xmath47-vectors such that @xmath55 .",
    "there are however two important disadvantages over other basis sets .",
    "first , the number of basis functions required is quite large , which increases computational cost .",
    "second , it is quite difficult to represent sharp peaks in the ks states , such as those occurring in the core regions near nuclei due to the singularity of the electron - nuclear coulomb attraction .",
    "the states in the core region have however a negligible contribution to the electronic properties of a material .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary to represent them or the coulomb potential exactly .",
    "first , the states localized entirely within a core region , called core states , may be precomputed ( the frozen core approximation ) , avoiding the need to include them explicitly in the calculation .",
    "second , the coulomb potential in the core regions can be replaced with a pseudopotential which is constructed to reproduce the atomic scattering properties and coulombic form outside the core region , but which is weaker and smoother inside .",
    "the remaining states , called valence states , are described by pseudo - wavefunctions which are significantly smoother , hence improving the convergence with respect to @xmath53 , without loss of accuracy @xcite .",
    "the pseudopotential consists of two parts : one local part @xmath56 , and a nonlocal part @xmath57 . in the pseudopotential",
    "setting , the kohn - sham equation is still formulated as , but @xmath22 is now being @xmath58 , @xmath0 now being the number of valence electrons , and @xmath59 being the set of the pseudo - wavefunctions of the valence electrons",
    ". the pseudo - wavefunctions can be approximated by far fewer basis functions @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the pseudopotential case .",
    "therefore , we get a finite plane - wave discretization of as follows : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a finite @xmath62 dimensional space spanned by the plane - wave basis , @xmath62 is the number of @xmath47 satisfying ( [ e3 ] ) , i.e @xmath63\\big|\\mathbf{g}\\in\\mathbb{z } , \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{g}|^2 \\leq e_\\mathrm{cut } \\},\\ ] ] and @xmath64      the kohn - sham equation is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem .",
    "it is usually dealt with using a scf approach @xcite .",
    "typically one starts with an initial guess for @xmath65 , then calculates the corresponding @xmath66(\\mathbf{r})$ ] and solves the kohn - sham equation for the @xmath67 . from these one calculates a new density and starts again .",
    "this procedure is then repeated until convergence is reached .",
    "the following is the general algorithm of the self - consistent field iteration :    1 .",
    "give initial input charge density @xmath68 .",
    "2 .   compute the effective potential @xmath69 .",
    "3 .   find @xmath70 satisfying @xmath71 4 .   compute the new output charge density @xmath72 .",
    "convergence check : if not converged , use some density mixing method to get the new input charge density @xmath68 , goto step 2 ; else , stop .",
    "the variation of the charge density is often used as the criterion for the convergence of the self consistent field in the quantum chemistry calculation . for the density mixing method in step 5 ,",
    "if we simply take @xmath72 as the initial density of the next iteration , it converges too slowly or even does not converge .",
    "therefore , it is very important to choose the proper density mixing method .",
    "many such density mixing methods have been proposed so far .",
    "the most widely used are the following ones : simple mixing @xcite , pulay s mixing @xcite , broyden s mixing method @xcite and modified broyden s mixing method @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the modified broyden s mixing method .    after plane - wave discretization and scf iteration",
    ", we obtain the following large scale linear eigenvalue problem @xmath73 where @xmath74 with @xmath75 , \\mathrm{exp}[\\mathrm{i}(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{g}_n)\\mathbf{r } ] ) \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{g}_m|^2\\delta_{m , n}+ \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\int_{\\omega}v_\\mathrm{eff}(\\rho_{in})\\mathrm{exp}[-\\mathrm{i } ( \\mathbf{g}_m+\\mathbf{g}_n)\\cdot \\mathbf{r}]\\;d\\mathbf{r }    \\end{split}\\ ] ] is the stiff matrix , @xmath76 is the overlap matrix .",
    "if we use the norm - conserving pseudopotentials , @xmath77 in tradition , people usually focus on solving the large scale linear eigenvalue problem repeatedly .",
    "however , the solution of the large scale eigenvalue problem requires large scale orthogonal operation , which limits large scale parallelization in supercomputer .",
    "motivated by the good performance of the parallel orbital - updating approach in the real space method @xcite , we apply the similar idea to the reciprocal space setting so as to cure the poor parallel scalability of the traditional method in the reciprocal space .",
    "in fact , this is one of the series works on the parallel orbital - updating approach @xcite .",
    "the following algorithm 1 is the basic parallel orbital - updating algorithm for solving the kohn - sham equation based on plane - wave bases .",
    "choose initial @xmath78 and then obtain @xmath79 , give the initial data @xmath80 , and let @xmath81 .",
    "2 .   increase @xmath82 to @xmath83 and then obtain @xmath84 .",
    "3 .   for @xmath85 ,",
    "find @xmath86 satisfying @xmath87 in parallel , where @xmath88 is the input charge density obtained by the orbits obtained in the @xmath6-th iteration or the previous iterations .",
    "4 .   find @xmath89 satisfying + @xmath90 + where @xmath91 , @xmath92 is the input charge density obtained from @xmath93 and @xmath94 for @xmath95 , @xmath31 . 5 .",
    "convergence check : if not converged , set @xmath96 , go to step 2 ; else , stop .",
    "using algorithm 1 , the solution of the large scale linear eigenvalue problem is replaced by the solution of a series of independent source problems and some small scale eigenvalue problems .",
    "since the source problems are all independent , they can be solved in parallel intrinsically . for each source problem",
    ", we can use the traditional parallelization strategies , such as domain decomposition or parallelization in matrix vector multiplication .",
    "therefore , our algorithm has two level of which is advantageous for large scale parallelization . besides , since the solution of the source problems is much cheaper than that of eigenvalue problems , especially for large scale problems , our basic parallel orbital - updating algorithm will reduce the computational cost .",
    "more features of this algorithm are given in ref .",
    "it is worth noting that algorithm 1 can be used staring from a small cutoff energy and then increasing it until the accuracy is reached .",
    "as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are several options for each steps in algorithm 1 . for example , one can calculate more orbitals if the initial guess is not good enough , or one can also choose different source problems .    in this section",
    ", we will present two new modifications not mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , which are denoted by algorithm 2 and algorithm 3 as follows .",

    "2 .   increase @xmath82 to @xmath83 , and obtain @xmath84 .",

    "4 .   find @xmath101 satisfying @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the input charge density obtained from the previous orbits .",
    "convergence check : if not converged , go to step 2 ; else , stop .    for any @xmath105",
    ", we define the projection operator @xmath106 as : @xmath107 then we can also define the following modified parallel orbital - updating algorithm .    1 .",
    "choose initial @xmath78 and then get @xmath97 , give the initial data @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath81 .",
    "2 .   increase @xmath82 to @xmath83 , and obtain @xmath84 .",
    "3 .   for @xmath85 ,",
    "find @xmath99 satisfying @xmath108 in parallel , where @xmath88 is the input charge density obtained by the orbits obtained in the @xmath6-th iteration or the former iterations .",
    "4 .   find @xmath101 satisfying @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the input charge density obtained from the previous orbits .",
    "convergence check : if not converged , go to step 2 ; else , stop .",
    "we can see that algorithms 2 and 3 have all the features of algorithm 1 .",
    "the main difference is that the dimensions of the small scale eigenvalue problems are double of that in algorithm 1 .",
    "in this section , we apply our parallel orbital - updating algorithms to simulate several crystalline systems : si ( silicon ) , mgo ( magnesium oxide ) and al ( aluminium ) with different sizes to show the efficiency of our algorithms .",
    "our algorithms are implemented in the software package quantum espresso @xcite , which is a mature and open - source computer codes for electronic - structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale .",
    "it is based on density functional theory , it uses a plane - wave basis sets and pseudopotentials .",
    "currently quantum espresso supports paw ( projector - augmented wave ) sets @xcite , ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite and norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite .",
    "we use the norm - conserving pseudopotentials in our tests .",
    "quantum espresso also provides various density mixing methods . in our experiments , we choose the modified broyden s mixing method .",
    "there are some diagonalization methods in the quantum espresso .",
    "one is the conjugate - gradient - like band - by - band diagonalization , the other is the davidson iterative diagonalization .",
    "conjugate - gradient - like band - by - band diagonalization ( cg ) uses less memory and is more robust compared to the davidson iterative diagonalization with overlap matrix @xcite .",
    "therefore , we compare our our new algorithms with the conjugate - gradient - like band - by - band diagonalization used in quantum espresso . in our tests , we set the convergence threshold for the density to @xmath109 .",
    "in the tests of our new algorithms , we did not use the possibility to gradually increase the cutoff energy , that is , the cutoff energy is fixed . for this special case , @xmath110 is not updated , and the step 3 and step 4 in all our algorithms are carried out in @xmath110 repeatedly .",
    "all calculations are carried out on lssc - iii in the state key laboratory of scientific and engineering computing , chinese academy of sciences , and in part on the ulysses computer cluster in sissa .",
    "we carefully checked that the total energies and the eigenvalues obtained by all our new methods converge to those obtained by the cg method if the latter converges .",
    "indeed we should point out that we have also found some cases for which the cg method did not converge while our methods did , as shown later .",
    "since the results of the modified parallel orbital - updating obtained by the algorithm 3 are similar to those obtained by the algorithm 2 , we only list the results of the modified parallel orbital - updating methods obtained by the algorithm 2 in the following numerical experiments .",
    "we first introduce some notations which will be used in the following tables and figures .",

    "we should point out that , in our current tests , the cutoff energy is set to be a fixed value . if we can start from a small cutoff energy and increase it until the convergence is reached , we can reduce the computational cost further . from this point of view",

    "@xcite , we propose some modified parallel orbital - updating methods for the plane - wave discretization of the kohn - sham equation in this paper . we show that , by using the two - level parallelization of the orbital - updating approach , the poor parallel scalability of the plane - wave discretization can be largely improved .",
    "indeed our numerical experiments show that the parallel orbital - updating approach based plane - wave method has considerable potential for carrying out large system computation on modern supercomputers .",
    "we should point out that our two - level parallelization only focuses on the solution of the associated eigenvalue problems resulting from the electronic structure calculations .",
    "in fact , in the electronic structure calculations , there are some other possibility for parallelization . for example , when using hybrid functionals for approximating the exchange - correlation energy , the exchange potential can be obtained by solving many different poisson equations , which can be done in parallel intrinsically .",
    "any such kind of parallelization can be combined with our algorithms and hence further increase the parallelization .",
    "as we have pointed out at beginning and at the end of section 5 , the cutoff energy was set to a fixed value in all our tests . to achieve the gradual increase of the cutoff energy , one needs to design some efficient a posteriori error estimator to tell how to evaluate and improve the approximate accuracy based on increasing the cutoff energy .",
    "it is indeed our on - going work to design such kind of a posteriori error estimator and then increase the cutoff energy gradually until the accuracy has been reached , which will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "we believe that in that case , the parallel efficiency of our new algorithms will become even better .",
