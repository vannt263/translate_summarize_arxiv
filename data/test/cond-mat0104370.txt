    "the discovery of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in a dilute alkali atomic gas opens up new perspective in the field of many body physics @xcite .",
    "most of the properties of these dilute gas can be explained by considering only two - body short range interaction which is characterized by the s - wave scattering length @xmath2@xcite .",
    "recently , a new kind of atomic bec has been proposed by d. odell _ et al_. @xcite .",
    "they have shown that the particular configuration of intense off - resonant laser beams gives rise to an effective gravity - like @xmath3 interatomic attraction between neutral atoms located well within the laser wavelength .",

    "there is a competition between the gravity - like potential either with the kinetic energy ( g ) or the two - body short range interatomic interaction potential characterized by the @xmath10-wave scattering length @xmath2 ( tf - g ) , which gives two new regimes for new atomic bec .",
    "these two regimes are obtained based on the gaussian variational ansatz for the ground state wave function @xcite .    in the tf - g regime",
    ", collective excitation frequencies has been calculated numerically by solving the equations of collisionless hydrodynamics @xcite . moreover , in this regime , an analytic expression of the ground state density is obtained @xcite . within the sum - rule approach ,",
    "collective excitation frequencies of a gravity - like self - bound bose gas has been discussed in ref .",
    "there has been no systematic and detail study on the collective excitation frequencies and vortices of a gravitationally self - bound bose gas by using the time dependent variational approach .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an analytic expressions for collective excitation frequencies , superfluid coherence length and critical angular frequencies required to create a vortex of a rotating bose condensed state and to compare qualitatively the results of the tf - g regime with the results obtained in the tf regime of an ordinary atomic bec .    here",
    ", by using the time - dependent variational method , we obtain the excitation spectrum of a gravity - like self - bound bose gas .",
