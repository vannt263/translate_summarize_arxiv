    "the metal - insulator transition induced by disorder in the problem of anderson localization remains poorly understood from a theoretical point of view . on the one hand , it is true that the prediction for the existence of a metal - insulator transition induced by disorder has been verified by numerical simulations . on the other hand ,",
    "the critical exponents at the metal - insulating transition measured numerically still can not be extracted from the field theories which are believed to embody the metal - insulator transition.@xcite the paradigm of this unpleasant situation is the plateau transition in the lowest landau level of the integer quantum hall effect.@xcite the development of reliable methods to compute analytically critical properties at a disorder - induced metal - insulator transition remains to this date an open problem .",
    "the simplest known example of disorder - induced criticality in the context of anderson localization was solved by dyson in 1953.@xcite according to dyson , the global density of states ( dos ) in the thermodynamic limit and close to the band center is anomalous when a single quantum particle hops with a random amplitude between the nearest - neighbor sites of a chain excluding any other form of disorder , in short , the one - dimensional random hopping problem .",
    "subsequent works showed that dyson s spectral anomaly is related to a diverging localization length,@xcite an anomalous decay of the envelope of wave functions,@xcite and an anomalous probability distribution of the resistance upon approaching the band center.@xcite    the coalescence of the concept of universality imported from the theory of critical phenomena with the symmetry classification imported from random matrix theory has led to a classification of diffusive regimes and disorder - induced metal - insulator transitions in terms of 10 universality classes that are uniquely characterized by the intrinsic symmetries preserved by the disorder ( assumed weak ) for any given dimensionality of space.@xcite according to this classification , dyson s singular dos is a trademark of the chiral universality classes .",
    "the chiral universality classes are realized in problems of anderson localization for which the hamiltonian anticommutes with some unitary operator for all realizations of the disorder and in which case the dos is known to be singular at the band center in zero,@xcite quasi - one,@xcite and two dimensions.@xcite even though the chiral universality classes are critical at the band center , they have been far less studied than the orthogonal , unitary , and symplectic universality classes , which we will refer to as the standard universality classes .",
    "for example , the probability distribution of the so - called mesoscopic local density of states ( ldos ) has been known since 1989 from the work of altshuler and prigodin for a single chain with weak on - site disorder,@xcite whereas it has not yet been computed for the one - dimensional random - hopping problem .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to fill this gap .",
    "if a diffusive regime exists , perturbative techniques can be used to describe the crossovers between universality classes.@xcite however , little is known quantitatively on the crossover between two different universality classes , here defined in terms of nonlinear - sigma models , say , from the diffusive to the localized regimes .",
    "this is even true in one dimension , which is by far the most studied laboratory for anderson localization as was recently illustrated by a flurry of works on the validity of one - parameter scaling in one dimension.@xcite the absence of a diffusive regime renders the concept of universality classes ambiguous in one dimension in that symmetry alone does not specify a universality class in one dimension .",
    "for example , the ratio of the localization length to the mean free path in a wire of finite width interpolates smoothly between its two limiting values for fully preserved or completely broken time - reversal symmetry , respectivley , as a function of a weak magnetic field.@xcite similarly , fine tuning of microscopic parameters is required to achieve delocalization ( i.e. , diverging localization length ) of quasiparticles at the fermi energy in a dirty superconducting wire of finite thickness with both broken spin - rotation and time - reversal symmetries whereas delocalization becomes generic in the thick wire scaling limit.@xcite one can nevertheless define a _ symmetry class _ in one dimension by demanding that single - parameter scaling holds .",
    "lack of universality in one dimension can then be understood as the fact that there is no scaling limit for which single - parameter scaling becomes a generic property of an ensemble of random microscopic hamiltonians of a given symmetry .",
    "symmetry classes in one dimension can not be construed as an enumeration of stable or unstable fixed points of some putative effective field theory .",
    "computing the crossover between symmetry classes in one dimension nevertheless remains a well - defined problem .",
    "time - reversal symmetry can not be broken for a spinless particle constrained to move in a one - dimensional and simply connected world , in which case the only possible crossover between symmetry classes takes place between the chiral and standard classes .",
    "the second aim of this paper is to compute the crossover between these two symmetry classes in one dimension for the probability distributions of the conductance and of the ldos from the ballistic to the localized regimes assuming a weak disorder at the microscopic level . in that regard ,",
    "our results are complementary to the analysis made by schomerus and titov of the validity of one - parameter scaling in one dimension in which they computed exactly the first four cumulants of the logarithm of the conductance to leading order in the ratio of the length of the chain to the localization length assuming a weak disorder at the microscopic level.@xcite we thus propose an approximate ansatz for the crossover whereby the approximation consists of assuming that the phase and amplitude of the reflection coefficient separate . by comparing the cumulants of the lyapunov exponent of the transfer matrix computed with our approximate ansatz to the ones computed with the large - deviation ansatz of schomerus and titov deep in the localization regime , we deduce that our ansatz captures the first cumulant , but fails with the higher cumulants .",
