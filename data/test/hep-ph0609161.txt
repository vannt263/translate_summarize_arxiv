    "the behavior of hadronic cross sections at high energy has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigations for several decades .",
    "these studies will become even more relevant with the advent of the lhc , where protons will collide at a center - of - mass energy of 14  tev .    in the following , we will focus on the forward elastic amplitude @xmath0 for the scattering of two hadronic objects at total rapidity @xmath1 , one of the objects ( called the probe ) being characterized by a tunable momentum @xmath2 , that defines the scales in the plane transverse to the collision axis .",
    "the other hadron will be called the target .",
    "the scattering occurs at a given impact parameter that , here , will be fixed .",
    "experimentally , the corresponding process could be , for example , deep - inelastic electron - proton ( or nucleus ) scattering , in which case @xmath2 would be of order of the virtuality of the exchanged photon .",
    "the total rapidity @xmath1 can be seen as the rapidity of the target in the rest frame of the probe : it is related to the squared center - of - mass energy @xmath3 through @xmath4 .",
    "note that one could equally well work in transverse coordinates instead of momenta , which proves useful in many cases : in coordinate space , @xmath5 is directly related to the probability that the probe of size @xmath6 interact with the evolved target at the considered impact parameter , which in particular results in the unitarity bound @xmath7 .",
    "the relationship between the two representations of the amplitude reads @xmath8 although total cross sections are not computable from standard qcd methods since confinement effects necessarily enter , the evolution with rapidity of the scattering amplitudes for a localized probe at a given impact parameter ( understood in eq .",
    "( [ transfo ] ) ) may be obtained starting from perturbative calculations that lead e.g. to the balitsky hierarchy of equations @xcite . in the latter framework",
    ", the evolution of @xmath9 reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "one had to introduce @xmath12 which is meant to be the scattering amplitude off _ one particular configuration _ of the target .",
    "it is its average over all quantum fluctuations of the latter that corresponds to the physically measurable amplitude : @xmath13 .",
    "( [ b ] ) is not closed : one needs a further evolution equation for @xmath14 .",
    "( [ b ] ) is only the first equation of an infinite hierarchy which involves increasingly complex mathematical objects .",
    "solving that system is a formidable task , and not surprisingly , no one has found a solution from a direct study of eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "another problem with the hierarchy is that it is not clear whether its complete form for arbitrary targets is known .",
    "a significantly simpler equation may be obtained by arbitrarily factorizing the correlator @xmath15 into the product @xmath16 , within a kind of mean field approximation that neglects fluctuations in the target .",
    "this was first proposed by balitsky @xcite and subsequently re - derived by kovchegov @xcite in the particular physical context of deep - inelastic scattering off an infinitely large nucleus .",
    "an elegant representation of the resulting equation is obtained in momentum space by using eq .",

    "( [ bk ] ) are now known  @xcite , but the effects of the fluctuations neglected in going to the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation  ( [ bk ] ) and even their very nature had not been appreciated until quite recently .",
    "one may guess that one difficulty with eqs .",
    "( [ b ] ) and  ( [ bk ] ) is that they both contain nonlinearities .",
    "the latter are meant to encode parton saturation effects  @xcite .",
    "one could think of neglecting them ( by dropping the @xmath19 term in eq .",
    "( [ bk ] ) for example ) , and indeed , that used to be the usual approximation until a few years ago .",
    "the resulting equation is named after balitsky , fadin , kuraev and lipatov ( bfkl ) @xcite ( @xmath18 that appears in eq .",
    "( [ bk ] ) is called the bfkl kernel ) .",
    "but in 1999 , golec - biernat and wsthoff showed @xcite that the nonlinearities in eqs .",
    "( [ b]),([bk ] ) may already play an important role in the most recent data for deep - inelastic scattering ( see also ref .",
    "their work stirred a great theoretical interest for the full nonlinear equations .",
    "for a long time , it was the bk equation that was the focus of most of the theoretical and phenomenological works in high energy qcd , despite the relative arbitrariness of the approximations made to get it . only in 2004 did mueller and shoshi address the problem of trying to quantify effects beyond those described by the bk equation , using a very original approach @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a deep interpretation of what they had done in relation with problems of statistical mechanics was found @xcite , which paved the way for a new and fruitful understanding of high energy qcd .",
    "the goal of these two lectures is to show that high energy scattering looks very much like some processes ( called reaction - diffusion ) that appear in other physical , biological , or chemical contexts",
    ". we will provide a very simple and transparent picture of high energy qcd , but accurate enough to enable one to get presumably exact analytical results for qcd .",
    "the first lecture ( sec .  [ lecture1 ]",
    ") aims at establishing this correspondence .",
    "`` cross - fertilization '' is the title of these lectures because while investigating this relationship , we were able to also derive some general results that apply to a wider context . the second lecture ( sec .  [ lecture2 ] ) reviews them .",
    "the most important of these results may directly be transposed to qcd . throughout",
    ", the focus will be put on the underlying physical ideas rather than on the technicalities ( references to original work where details are worked out will be provided whenever necessary ) .",
    "we would like the reader to appreciate that this business was made possible by coming back to the basic concepts of high energy scattering in the parton model in the light of apparently completely unrelated physics , rather than trying to address directly the very technical equations that have been established for qcd .",
    "our first task is to understand that it may sometimes be fruitful to replace a complicated problem ( like qcd evolution , see eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) ) by a much simpler one ( reaction - diffusion in our case , as we will see in these lectures ) , and yet be able to get _ quantitative _ results from the solution to the latter .",
    "this is possible when both models , the simple and the complicated ones , belong to the same _ universality class_.    the concept of universality was introduced in the 60 s by a bunch of renowned physicists , among whom widom , kadanoff , fisher and wilson in the theory of critical phenomena . to illustrate it ,",
    "let us consider a system of spins , that is a set of binary variables @xmath20 , on a two - dimensional lattice and interacting through the hamiltonian @xmath21 if @xmath22 when the sites @xmath23 and @xmath24 are nearest neighbors and 0 otherwise , this is the ising model with ferromagnetic interactions .",

    "at high temperature , all spin configurations have equal probability . at low temperature ,",
    "only a few configurations have a significant probability , the ones that minimize the energy .",
    "the minimum energy configuration is the one in which all spins are aligned .",
    "near the critical point , the average magnetization reads @xmath27 and an exact calculation gives @xmath28 for two - dimensional systems , as may be checked in standard statistical mechanics textbooks .",
    "the ising model may represent only a very idealized magnet .",
    "one may wonder why it is interesting to study extensively such an over - simplified model , which obviously incorporates only a few very basic properties of magnetic materials and neglects many others .",
    "well , it turns out that the exponent @xmath29 ( as well as a few other exponents ) is completely independent of the microscopic details of the system , which means that it is the _ exact _ result also for realistic magnets .",
    "of course , other quantities strongly depend on those details : this is the case for the critical temperature @xmath30 for example .",
    "the universality class is defined only by very general properties of the system , like the space dimension , and the symmetries .",
    "all systems that share these few properties are expected to bear the same critical exponents .",
    "so if one is able to solve the simplest model , one is likely to know important features of all representatives of its universality class .",
    "high energy qcd has little to do with the ising model and with criticality .",
    "we are now going to introduce a class of systems which , as we will argue later on , are likely to share universal properties with high energy qcd .",
    "we address the time evolution of a system of @xmath31 particles that obey the following rules : in each time interval @xmath32 , each single particle has a probability @xmath32 to split in 2 particles , and a probability @xmath33 to disappear .",

    "we consider the scattering of two hadrons made of quark - antiquark pairs of respective sizes @xmath77 and @xmath78 , to simplify the discussion ( see fig .  [",

    "we assume that these hadrons are small enough ( much smaller than @xmath79 ) so that perturbation theory applies .",
    "if there is few energy available for the scattering ( the hadrons interact almost at rest ) , then typically they are in their valence configuration .",
    "their interaction consists in exchanging one gluon when they are of similar size and at the same impact parameter : in this case , the forward elastic amplitude reads @xmath80 .",
    "if the hadrons are of very different sizes or if their impact parameters do not match , then they do not `` see '' each other and @xmath81 .",
    "now boost one of the hadrons , called the target : this corresponds to increasing the center - of - mass energy of the reaction .",
    "due to the resulting opening of phase space , a typical configuration of the target is no longer the bare valence quarks , but the latter together with a number @xmath82 of gluons of transverse momentum @xmath2 , whose mean depend on the rapidity .",
    "correspondingly , the scattering amplitude off that particular configuration of the target reads @xmath83 where @xmath2 is of the order of the inverse size of the hadronic probe .",

    "is in fact the number of such dipoles . ]    in a given realization of the fock space of the target , the number of gluons typically doubles when @xmath84 is increased by one unit ( each gluon has a probability to split in 2 gluons ) .",
    "the transverse momenta of the new gluons are close to the ones of their parents , up to some diffusion .",
    "this branching diffusion process is encoded in the bfkl evolution kernel @xmath85 defined in the introduction .",
    "as we are following one given realization , that evolves randomly , the equation contains a stochastic term of order @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath86 from eq .",
    "( [ tn ] ) . at this stage , we may write the evolution of the scattering amplitude off one particular realization as @xmath87 where @xmath36 is a noise of zero - mean whose variations are of order one when @xmath88 and @xmath84 are varied by one unit .    because @xmath12 is related to an interaction probability , @xmath89 in appropriate normalizations and so the number of gluons of given momentum ( related to @xmath26 ) can not grow exponentially forever .",

    "the bk equation  ( [ bk ] ) is known to admit traveling wave solutions  @xcite , whose position @xmath67 ( which corresponds in qcd to the so - called saturation scale @xmath96 through @xmath97 ) is a deterministic function of the rapidity .",
    "this property is related to a phenomenon observed in the deep - inelastic scattering data and called `` geometric scaling '' @xcite : the physical amplitude @xmath0 only depends on the combined variable @xmath98 , and not on @xmath2 and @xmath1 separately .",

    "( [ qcd ] ) is a noisy traveling wave , which has a random position ( i.e. saturation scale ) whose statistics follow eq .",
    "( [ stat ] ) ( use the dictionary  ( [ dictionary ] ) ) .",
    "the consequence is that @xmath93 has a peculiar scaling behavior , different from geometric scaling @xcite : @xmath99 which is easy to derive from eqs .",
    "( [ stat]),([frontshape ] ) .",
    "mueller and shoshi were the first authors who noticed that geometric scaling was broken beyond the bk equation .",

    "let us summarize the assumptions that have lead to eqs .",
    "( [ qcd ] ) and  ( [ solqcd ] ) .",
    "the linear terms therein represent the perturbative splitting of the partons when rapidity increases , and may be obtained exactly e.g. in the framework of the color dipole model @xcite .",
    "we have not written down explicitely the distribution of the noise @xmath36 ( we just gave its typical variations ) , but the solution  ( [ solqcd ] ) is robust with respect to its detailed form .",
    "the nonlinear term is supposed to encode parton saturation .",
    "so far , we can not provide an exact expression for it because a qcd realization of saturation has not been derived .",
    "however , the solution  ( [ solqcd ] ) is also universal with respect to the form of the nonlinearities .",
    "the only really important condition for universality arguments to apply is that there should indeed be saturation , i.e. the gluon density should not be able to grow forever .",

    "( [ solqcd ] ) represents the exact asymptotics of qcd .",
    "last , we would like to draw the attention of the reader to the fact that we do not think that these results are very relevant phenomenologically yet , since the asymptotics show up only for @xmath100 ( which means that @xmath101 has to be unrealistically small ) . in our opinion",

    "( [ detfkpp ] ) , as can be seen on the solution  ( [ front ] ) . for @xmath126 ,",
    "this might not be a problem , but for @xmath127 , neglecting discreteness may prove very wrong , especially since the propagation of the wave front is very sensitive to its tail .",
    "brunet and derrida came up with the idea that this discreteness could be incorporated back into the deterministic equation  ( [ detfkpp ] ) by simply adding a cutoff that forbids the values of @xmath64 between 0 and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "they solved an equation of the type - function in eq .",
    "( 28 ) should not be applied to the diffusion term . in the case of the f - kpp equation",
    ", one would rather write @xmath128 although there would still be problems with the very mathematical definition of such an equation .",
    "( 28 ) would be correct literally if @xmath38 were discrete with steps @xmath129 of order 1 . ]",
    "@xmath130\\theta(u-1/n ) \\label{cutoff}\\ ] ]    and claimed that the solution matched the first order of the full equation in a small - noise ( large-@xmath45 ) expansion .",
    "we may estimate the large-@xmath38 velocity @xmath131 of the traveling wave solution of eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "starting from some initial condition , the front evolves toward the asymptotic shape @xmath132 and its velocity increases according to eq .",
    "( [ vt ] ) . however , as soon as the asymptotic front extends down to values of @xmath127 , that is for @xmath133 , where @xmath134 this shape can not extend any further because of the cutoff in eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "then also the front velocity can not grow any longer . according to eq .",
    "( [ range ] ) , this happens at time @xmath135 , time at which the velocity reads @xmath136 according to eq .",
    "( [ vt ] ) .",
    "@xmath137 is a factor of order 1 whose determination needs a more accurate calculation @xcite .",
    "the complete result reads @xmath138 the philosophy behind this procedure is quite transparent .",
    "as soon as there are a few particles on a spatial site , parton number fluctuations are negligible and the subsequent evolution in that bin is deterministic .",
    "( one can get convinced of this statement already by looking at realizations of the evolution in the zero - dimensional model , see fig .",
    "[ fig : zerod ] ) . on the other hand , in the bins in which the deterministic evolution predicts a number of particles less than 1 ( @xmath139 )",
    ", one just sets @xmath64 to 0 in order to simulate discreteness .",
    "this is the effect of the cutoff .",
    "the brunet - derrida cutoff procedure led to the following result : the front propagates at a velocity @xmath131 lower than the velocity predicted by the mean - field equation  ( [ detfkpp ] ) , and its shape is the decreasing exponential ( eq .  ( [ front ] ) ) , down to the position @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) , at which it is sharply cut off .",
    "but it may happen that a few extra particles are sent stochastically ahead of the sharp tip of the front ( see fig .",
    "[ fluct ] ) .",
    "their evolution would pull the front forward . to model this effect , we assume that the probability per unit time that there be a particle sent at a distance @xmath142 ahead of the tip simply continues the asymptotic shape of the front , that is to say @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a constant .",
    "heuristic arguments to support this assumption are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( appendix  a ) .",
    "note that while the exponential shape is quite natural since it is the continuation of the deterministic solution  ( [ front ] ) , the fact that @xmath144 need to be strictly constant ( and can not be a slowly varying function of @xmath142 ) is a priori more difficult to argue .",
    "now once a particle has been produced at position @xmath145 , say at time @xmath146 , it starts to multiply ( see fig .",
    "[ fluct ] ) and it eventually develops its own front ( after a time of the order of @xmath147 ) , that will add up to the deterministic primary front made of the evolution of the bulk of the particles .",
    "let us estimate the shift in the position of the front induced by these extra forward particles . between the times @xmath146 and @xmath148 ,",
    "the velocity of the secondary front is given by eq .",
    "( [ vt ] ) . hence its position @xmath149 , after relaxation , will be given by @xmath150 where @xmath141 .",
    "( [ xt2 ] ) holds up to a constant .",
    "we have used eq .",
    "( [ vt ] ) to express @xmath151 .",
    "the observed front will eventually result in the sum of the primary and secondary fronts , after relaxation of the latter .",
    "its position will be @xmath152 supplemented by a shift @xmath153 that may be computed by writing the resulting front shape as the sum of the primary and secondary fronts : @xmath154 where @xmath155 is an undetermined constant . from eq .",
    "( [ sumfronts ] ) we can compute the shift due to the relaxation of a forward fluctuation @xmath153 : @xmath156 the probability distribution  ( [ proba ] ) and the front shift  ( [ r ] ) due to a forward fluctuation define an effective theory for the evolution of the position of the front @xmath67 : @xmath157 from these rules , we may compute all cumulants of @xmath67 : @xmath158}{t}=\\int d\\delta p(\\delta)[r(\\delta)]^n\\\\ & \\phantom{\\frac{[\\text{$n$-th cumulant}]}{t } }    = \\frac{c_1c_2}{\\gamma_0}\\frac{n!\\zeta(n)}{\\gamma_0^n l^3}. \\end{split } \\label{cumulants}\\ ] ]    we see that the statistics of the position of the front still depend on the product @xmath159 of the undetermined constants @xmath144 and @xmath155 .",
    "we need a further assumption to fix its value .",
    "we go back to the expression for the correction to the mean - field front velocity , given in eq .",
    "( [ cumulants ] ) . from the expressions of @xmath153",
    "( [ r ] ) ) and of @xmath160 ( eq .  ( [ proba ] ) ) , we see that the integrand defining @xmath161 is almost a constant function of @xmath142 for @xmath162 , and is decaying exponentially for @xmath163 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath164 is of order 1 , which means that when a fluctuation is emitted at a distance @xmath165 ahead of the tip of the front , it evolves into a front that matches in position the deterministic primary front .",
    "we also notice that when a fluctuation has @xmath166 , its evolution is completely linear until it is incorporated to the primary front , whereas fluctuations with @xmath163 evolve nonlinearly but at the same time have a very suppressed probability .",
    "we are thus led to the natural conjecture that the average front velocity is given by eq .",
    "( [ vbd ] ) , with the replacement @xmath167 .",
    "the large-@xmath45 expansion of the new expression of the velocity yields a correction of the order of @xmath168 to the brunet - derrida result , more precisely @xmath169 eqs .",
    "( [ cumulants ] ) and  ( [ vcorr ] ) match for the choice @xmath170 . from this determination of @xmath159",
    ", we also get the full expression of the cumulants : @xmath171}{t}= \\pi^2\\gamma_0 ^ 2\\chi^{\\prime\\prime}(\\gamma_0 ) \\frac{n!\\zeta(n)}{\\gamma_0^n\\ln^3 n}. \\label{cumcorr}\\ ] ] we note that all cumulants are of order unity for @xmath172 , which is the sign that the distribution of the front position is far from a trivial gaussian , which makes it particularly interesting . on the other hand , they are proportional to @xmath173 , which is the sign that the position of the front is the result of the sum of @xmath174 independent random variables , and as such , becomes gaussian when @xmath174 is very large .",
    "these results rely on a number of conjectures that no - one has been able to prove so far . however , we performed very precise numerical checks on specific models , and we found a perfect matching ( see ref .",
    "so we are reasonably confident that our expressions are the correct ones .",
    "providing a formal proof would be an interesting challenge for a mathematician .    the analytical results presented here , namely eqs .",
    "( [ vcorr ] ) and  ( [ cumcorr ] ) , may directly be applied to qcd using the dictionary  ( [ dictionary ] ) .",
    "this would help to improve the analytic form of the amplitude  ( [ qcd ] ) .",
    "let us now consider a model of population evolution .",
    "each individual is characterized by a single real number @xmath49 that measures its adequacy to the environment . at time",
    "@xmath38 , there are @xmath48 individuals in the population with a given adequacy @xmath49 . to go from time @xmath38 to @xmath175 , we give the following rule : each individual dies after having given birth to 2 offspring , that have respective adequacies @xmath176 and @xmath177 , where @xmath178 are random variables distributed according to a sufficiently local probability distribution @xmath179 .",
    "if the total population exceeds a given integer @xmath45 , then we get rid of the individuals with the lowest values of @xmath49 in order to keep the population size constant and equal to @xmath45 .",
    "this model could represent for example the evolution of a population of bacterias under asexual reproduction , in a medium where resources are limited , which enforces a selection of the `` best '' individuals .",
    "let us define @xmath180 to be the fraction of population that has its adequacy variable larger than @xmath49 .",
    "it is not difficult to realize that @xmath64 has the shape of a wave front , connecting a region where @xmath107 ( for small values of @xmath49 ) , and a region where @xmath106 ( for larger values of @xmath49 ) , that moves toward positive @xmath49 when time elapses , see fig .",
    "[ evol ] .",
    "one may write a stochastic evolution equation for @xmath64 : @xmath181 where as usually , @xmath36 is a noise of zero mean and variance of order 1 in the region where @xmath64 is small . at first sight , it is far from obvious that this equation should be in the universality class of the f - kpp equation .",
    "first , this is a finite difference equation in @xmath38 rather than a differential equation .",
    "second , the noise term is non - gaussian and furthermore , a closer look shows that @xmath36 is strongly correlated spatially .",
    "the nonlinearity is also of completely different nature in this model .",
    "however , the fact that a noisy front is formed for @xmath64 and especially the physical mechanism of evolution ( branching diffusion+saturation ) points toward the f - kpp universality class .",
    "if this is true , we can apply the results obtained in the previous subsection to study how the mean adequacy @xmath49 grows with time ( this would be the average position of the front ) .",
    "it is easy to see that for this model , the characteristic function would be @xmath182 we checked that a numerical simulation of this model indeed matches the analytical predictions , confirming that the model  ( [ stochaevol ] ) is indeed in the universality class defined by the f - kpp evolution .    for that kind of evolution models , one may ask a further question . at a given time @xmath38",
    ", one may pick a given number of individuals , say 2 or 3 , and count the number of generations one has to go back in the past to find their most recent common ancestor .",
    "we denote these numbers by @xmath183 , @xmath184  this question may be relevant to studies of the genetic diversity of a population .",
    "it is not difficult to guess the order of magnitude of @xmath185 .",
    "we saw in the previous subsection that @xmath67 looked like the sum of @xmath173 independent random variables .",
    "one can understand this fact very precisely on this model .",
    "indeed , from time to time , the evolution generates an individual whose adequacy to the environment is much larger than the one of any other individual .",
    "his offspring will partly inherit his adequacy , according to the stochastic evolution rules and thus will still be in advance with respect to the bulk of the population .",
    "after some generations , only his descendants may survive , so that he will be the common ancestor of the whole population .",
    "for an individual to have a significant probability to have his descendance replacing the whole population at some later time , the position of the secondary front developed by this individual has to be larger than the position of the primary front , a condition which reads @xmath186 . according to eq .",
    "( [ proba ] ) , this happens once in @xmath187 generations .",
    "hence @xmath188 it turns out that through a slightly more elaborate analysis , we may also fully compute the coefficients of the @xmath185 , simply from the assumptions of the previous subsection on the mechanism of the propagation of the front .",
    "we found @xcite @xmath189 these numbers characterize the statistics of the genealogical trees that can be drawn in this kind of models .",
    "it is not clear if results such as  ( [ ctime ] ) and  ( [ coalescence ] ) may be applied to particle physics observables .",
    "the latter may be more relevant to evolutionary biology .",
    "a spin glass @xcite is a system of spins with random interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by eq .",
    "( [ hising ] ) , but the @xmath190 are now random numbers endowed with a given probability distribution .",
    "the simplest case is when @xmath190 are binary variables @xmath191 , but the standard choice is a gaussian distribution which leads to a model named after edwards and anderson . the sherrington - kirkpatrick model is the infinite - range version of the latter : the same distribution holds for any pair of spins and not only for nearest neighbors .",
    "this time , the minimum energy state at zero temperature is not unique , contrarily to the ising case for which the minimum energy configuration is reached when all spins are aligned .",
    "this is due to `` frustration '' ( the fact that all interactions can never be satisfied simultaneously ) , and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinglass ] .    to classify the configurations ,",
    "one may define the overlap between two spin configurations @xmath192 and @xmath193 as a function that reflects the fraction of spins that are common to @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "the usual definition is @xmath194 .",
    "speaking through the hat , the configurations that minimize the energy are organized ultrametrically with respect to a distance derived from the overlap .",
    "this means that the configurations may be represented as the leaves of a ( random ) tree .",
    "the statistics of this tree , first found by parisi @xcite , turn out to be exactly the same as the ones of our genealogic trees in the previous subsection that are encoded in the ratios  ( [ coalescence ] ) .",
    "it should be clear to the reader that there is no a priori reason for such a feature .",
    "the method for finding the statistics in parisi s theory relies on the replica method ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , and has nothing to do with the way we derived the result in our case . whether this link is deep or accidental is an outstanding open question , for which we have no clue .",
    "when it was first suggested that high energy qcd has something to do with reaction - diffusion processes and that this analogy leads to new quantitative predictions @xcite , many experts were skeptical and reluctant to accept this new point of view .",
    "getting these ideas through has involved some passionate debates , to say the least .",
    "but at the time of the present lectures , that is two years later , this proposal has undoubiously triggered a burst of activity , that has spread in many different directions .",
    "the main advantage of viewing high energy scattering in the peculiar way that we have explained here is that it provides a simple picture endowed with a clear physical interpretation .",
    "this contrasts with the high technicity of evolution equations for qcd amplitudes that had been derived over the last 10 years such as the balitsky hierarchy  ( [ b ] ) .",
    "furthermore , this picture has a direct and intuitive connection with the basics of the parton model .",
    "this approach has paved the way for new results in qcd , obtained from tools known in statistical physics .    obviously , there is still room for improvements of our understanding of high energy scattering .",
    "admittedly , our proposal relies on a few conjectures that will have to be proved . in our opinion ,",
    "the most problematic one is the assumption that the number of gluons or of color dipoles saturates at @xmath195 per unit of transverse phase space .",
    "of course , this has been part of the `` folklore '' of high energy physics at least since the seminal work of gribov , levin , ryskin in the 80 s @xcite .",
    "however , no qcd realization of saturation has yet been found . a relevant question would be , for example , how parton recombination may be implemented in the framework of the color dipole model . some interesting ideas",
    "have recently been put forward ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but a rigorous proof in qcd still has to be provided .    in the second lecture ,",
    "we have presented some recent advances in statistical physics to which we have been able to contribute . here",
    "also , there is an intriguing correspondence between two seemingly different physical problems : stochastic fronts and the theory of spin glasses .",
    "whether this is something deep or simply accidental still remains to be understood .",
