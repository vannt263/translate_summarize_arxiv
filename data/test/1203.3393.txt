    "when nanoscopic objects such as the quantum dots , nonowires or thin metallic layers are placed in a neighborhood of superconducting material they partly absorb its order parameter . on a microscopic level this proximity effect causes that electrons near the fermi energy become bound into pairs . upon forming a circuit with external leads ( which can be chosen as conducting , ferromagnetic or superconducting ) such effect",
    "can induce a number of unique properties in the normal and anomalous tunneling channels @xcite .",
    "for instance , the relation between correlations and the on - dot induced pairing has been recently experimentally probed by the andreev spectroscopy @xcite and the josephson current measurements @xcite signifying important role of the kondo effect on the subgap current .",
    "we address here the andreev - type transport through the double quantum dot ( dqd ) nanostructure coupled between the normal ( n ) and superconducting ( s ) leads .",
    "we focus on the subgap regime , i.e.  energies considerably smaller than the pairing gap @xmath2 of superconductor . under such conditions eigenstates of the uncorrelated quantum dots",
    "are represented either by the singly occupied states @xmath3 , @xmath4 or by coherent superpositions of the empty and doubly occupied configurations @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting bogolubov - type quasiparticle excitations have an influence on additional spectroscopic features originating for instance from the internal structure , the correlations , perturbations etc . due to the proximity effect",
    "all these appearing structures would show up _ simultaneously _ at negative and at positive energies .    to highlight this sort of emerging physics",
    "we shall explore in more detail the interference patterns originating from a charge leakage @xmath6 ( assumed to be much weaker than @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) between the central quantum dot ( qd@xmath9 ) and another side - attached one ( qd@xmath10 ) .",
    "we also analyze stability of these patterns with respect to a decoherence induced by coupling @xmath11 to the floating lead ( d ) as sketched in figure [ scheme ] .",
    "practically this d electrode can mean a substrate on which the quantum dots are deposited or it mimics the effects caused by phonons / photons @xcite .    without a decoherence the t - shape double quantum dot systems have been already studied theoretically considering both metallic leads ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and metallic / superconducting ones @xcite . in the regime of weak interdot coupling @xmath6",
    "this configuration of the quantum dots enables realization of the fano - type lineshapes ( for a survey on the fano effect and its realizations in various systems see ref .",
    "these features can arise when the electron waves transmitted between the external electrodes via a broad qd@xmath9 spectrum happen to interfere with the other electron waves resonantly scattered by the discrete qd@xmath10 levels @xcite .",
    "the hallmarks of destructive / constructive quantum interference show up in a form of the asymmetric lineshapes @xmath12 in the tunneling conductance , where the dimensionless argument @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath14 , @xmath15 denotes the asymmetry parameter and @xmath16 are some background functions slowly varying with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "such lineshapes have been indeed observed experimentally for the dqd coupled between the metallic leads @xcite .",
    "similar fano - type features have been also previously reported from the spectroscopic measurements for a number of systems , e.g.  the cobalt adatoms deposited on au(111 ) surfaces @xcite , the semiopen nanostructures @xcite , the dithiol benzene molecule placed between the gold electrodes @xcite , the hidden order phase of the heavy fermion compound uru@xmath10si@xmath10 @xcite , the dopant atoms located in the metal near a schottky barrier mosfet @xcite , and many other @xcite .",
    "considering the proximity effect in n - dqd - s heterojunctions we have recently emphasized @xcite the possibility to observe the particle / hole fano - type lineshapes in the subgap andreev transport .",
    "we would like to explore here how such fano - type structures are robust on a decoherence . since the floating lead ( d ) does not belong to a closed circuit we shall assume that a net current to / from such electrode vanishes , so its role can be treated merely as the source of a decoherence .",
    "formally our study extends the previous results of ref .",
    "@xcite onto the anomalous andreev transport . to our knowledge",
    "such problem has not been yet addressed in the literature and it might be of practical importance for the possible experimental measurements .",
    "influence of the bosonic ( phonon / photon ) modes shall be discussed elsewhere .    in the next section we briefly state formal aspects of the problem .",
    "next , we discuss a changeover of the fano - type lineshapes with respect to the asymmetric coupling @xmath18 which controls efficiency of the proximity effect .",
    "we also investigate in detail stability of the particle / hole fano features with respect to decoherence ( in the spectrum and in the andreev transmittance ) .",
    "finally , we take into account the correlations .",
    "in particular we argue that for strong enough coupling @xmath11 the kondo resonance formed on the side - attached quantum dot qd@xmath10 can induce a tiny interferometric pattern at @xmath19 .",
    "such kondo driven fano structure could be detectable by the low bias andreev conductance .",
    "the double quantum dot nanostructure shown in fig .  [ scheme ] can be described by the following anderson impurity hamiltonian @xmath20 where the bath @xmath21 consists of three external charge reservoirs ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 refers to the double quantum dot , and @xmath24 stands for the hybridization part .",

    "this behavior let us recall that the resonant level at @xmath1 gradually broadens uppon increasing @xmath11 .",
    "for this reason the electron waves are scattered on the side - attached quantum dot without any sharp change of the phase , thereby the fano - type interference is no longer possible @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the particle / hole fano - type lineshapes seem to be rather fragile entities with respect to @xmath11 .",

    "of course ( [ transmittance_a ] ) depends indirectly on various structures appearing in the spectrum of the central quantum dot , including the particle - hole fano features",
    ".    in particular , the zero - bias differential conductance @xmath85 \\label{g_a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is at low temperatures proportional to the transmittance @xmath86 so the optimal andreev conductance @xmath87 occurs when @xmath88 reaches the ideal value 1 . in figure [ decoh_ta ]",

    "<S> we investigate the fano - type spectroscopic lineshapes of the t - shape double quantum dot coupled between the conducting and superconducting electrodes and analyze their stability on a decoherence . because of the proximity effect the quantum interference patterns appear simultaneously at @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an energy of the side - attached quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> we find that decoherence gradually suppresses both such interferometric structures . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that at low temperatures another tiny fano - type structure can be induced upon forming the kondo state on the side - coupled quantum dot due to its coupling to the floating lead . </S>"
