    "quantum entanglement provides a valuable resource for many important applications in quantum communication , quantum computation and quantum metrology . for example",
    ", quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , and other quantum communication protocols all require the entanglement to set up the quantum channel . in one - way quantum computation ,",
    "they require to create the cluster state to perform the task @xcite .",
    "however , entanglement is generally fragile . in a practical noisy environment , the entanglement will decoherence and lose the quantum features . in current quantum information processing ,",
    "one of the main goals is to protect the entanglement against influences from the uncontrollable environment . in long - distance quantum communication ,",
    "the main approach is to protect the entanglement encoded in the physical qubits directly .",
    "for example , the approaches of quantum repeaters @xcite and photon noiseless linear amplification @xcite are used to extend the distance of the entanglement and protect the photon from the photon loss , respectively .",
    "the approaches of entanglement purification and concentration are used to extract the maximally entangled states from the degraded entangled states @xcite . in quantum computation ,",
    "the main approach is to utilize the quantum correction code , by encoding a single physical quantum state to a logic quantum qubit which contains many physical qubits @xcite .",
    "therefore , by using redundant encodings together with manipulations and measurements in such a way that the quantum features can be protected .",
    "interestingly , the approach of encoding many physical qubits in a logic qubit has also been discussed for logic qubits entanglement @xcite .",
    "recently , frwis and dr studied a class of quantum entangled state which shows similar feature as the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state , but it is more robust than the normal ghz state in a noisy environment @xcite .",
    "it is called concatenated ghz ( c - ghz ) state of the form @xmath0 .",
    "the degree of such logic qubits entanglement decreases polynomially with particle number in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "_ described a way of creating the c - ghz state with cross - kerr nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "_ reported the experimental realization of a c - ghz state in optical system with @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "they also demonstrated that the c - ghz state is more robust than the conventional ghz state .    on one hand , up to now , though several groups discussed the c - ghz state in both theory and experiment , such logic entangled state has not been studied in current entanglement based quantum communication .",
    "on the other hand , as the c - ghz state is more robust , setting up the entanglement channel with logic qubits entanglement rather than the physical qubit entanglement may be an alternative way to resit the noisy environment . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss one of the most important two - qubit measurement , say the bell - state measurement @xcite .",
    "the bell - state measurement enables many important applications in quantum information processing , such as teleportation @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , and so on @xcite .",
    "different from the previous bell - state analysis , we describe the logic bell - state analysis ( lbsa ) . here , the logic bell state is the state in eq .",
    "( [ logic ] ) with @xmath5 .",
    "it is shown that such state can be deterministic distinguished with the help of controlled - not ( cnot ) gate . moreover",
    ", the approach for lbsa can also be extended to distinguish the c - ghz state with arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we will describe the approach of the lbsa . in sec .",
    "iii , we will extend this approach for distinguishing arbitrary c - ghz state .",
    "our protocol reveals that the logic bell - state and the c - ghz state analysis can be simplified to the conventional bell - state and ghz analysis , respectively . in sec .",
    "iv , we will present a discussion .",
    "it is shown that , with the help of lbsa , we can teleportate an unknown logic qubit . we also show that we can perform the complete logic entanglement swapping . in sec .",
    "v , we will make a conclusion .",

    "the standard bell states can be well distinguished with the cnot gate and the hadamard gate . from fig .",
    "1 , the qubits a@xmath11 and b@xmath11 pass through the cnot gate in a second time , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 will become @xmath26 finally , after the qubit a@xmath11 passing through the hadamard gate , both qubits are measured in the basis @xmath27 . if the measurement result is @xmath28 , the original state is @xmath8 .",

    "if the measurement result is @xmath31 or @xmath32 , the original state is @xmath33 or @xmath34 , respectively . in this way , the lbsa is completed .",

    "( [ multi1 ] ) can be simplified to distinguish the states @xmath37 in c - ghz state analysis , we only need to distinguish the states in the logic qubit level , and do not need to care about the exact information in each logic qubit .",
    "before we start this protocol , we first transform the states @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 to @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath40 , @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "such transformation can be completed by performing @xmath45 hadamard operations on each qubit and measuring these @xmath45 qubits in @xmath13 basis . from the measurement results , if the number of @xmath7 is even , the states @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 have fully transformed to @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath40 , @xmath44 , respectively .",

    ", we should perform a phase - flip operation to transform the states @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath40 , @xmath48 to @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath40 , @xmath44 , respectively . in fig .",
