    "in this paper we study an application of left - invariant total ordering of braid group @xmath1 to knot theory .",
    "an left - invariant total ordering , called dehornoy ordering is an interesting structure of braid groups found in 1990 s by dehornoy ( @xcite ) .",
    "today the ordering is interpreted in both algebraic and geometric way and these interpretation shows the dehornoy ordering is a quite natural structure of braid groups .",
    "braid groups are very important tool for studying links .",
    "many link invariants such as jones polynomial are first constructed via closed braid representative of links , so it is natural to study an application of this interesting structure of braid groups to knot theory . in @xcite,@xcite",
    "it is found that braid ordering can be seen as some kinds of restriction for admissibility of braid moves .",
    "braid moves are moves of closed braids which do not change their representing link types .",
    "most typical ( and important ) example of braid moves are _ exchange move _ or _ destabilization , stabilization _ , which is shown in figure [ braidmove ] .",
    "these works suggest that there would be some relationships between birman - menasco s braid foliation theory and ordering of braid groups because braid moves appears naturally in braid foliation theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , exchange move is used to make braid foliation simple and it is one of the most fundamental operation in birman - menasco s braid foliation theory .",
    "indeed , we investigate relationship between braid foliation and left invariant total ordering of braid groups , and obtain following result :        [ thm : main1 ] let @xmath2 be a braid and @xmath0 be an essential , genus @xmath3 closed surface in the complement of closed braid @xmath4 .    1 .",

    "2 .   if @xmath0 is mixed - foliated , @xmath5_{d } < 2g+1 $ ] .",

    ".    in above statements , @xmath6_{d}$ ] represents _ dehornoy floor _ of @xmath7 , which is a non - negative integer defined in section 2 .",
    "this integer is determined by the dehornoy ordering of braid groups , and efficiently computable .",
    "the notion of tiled , mixed foliated or circular foliated are derived from birman - menasco s braid foliation theory , which will be explained in section 3 .",
    "proof of theorem [ thm : main1 ] will be given in section 4 .",
    "theorem [ thm : main1 ] means braid ordering gives some information about the geometry of closed braid complements , and especially if dehornoy floor is relatively large with respect to its genus , then the surface can be positioned to special position , which is simple .",
    "we remark that dehornoy floor might vary under even conjugation , stabilization or destabilization , so it is far from knot invariant . indeed",
    ", dehornoy floor of braids obtained by performing stabilization always vanish .",
    "nevertheless theorem [ thm : main1 ] seems to suggests that braid ordering provide some important information about its closure which can not be obtained from known invariants of links .    as an application of theorem [ thm : main1 ] we obtain a sufficient condition for nielsen - thurston classification determines the geometry of its closure s complement .",
    "nielsen - thurston theorem states braids are classified into three types by their dynamics ; _ periodic , reducible _ and _ pseudo - anosov_. on the other hand , a famous thurston s hyperbolization theorem shows knots are classified into following three types by the geometry of their complements ; _ torus knots , satellite knots , _ and _ hyperbolic knots_. although there are many similarities between these two classifications , in general there are no one - to - one correspondence of them . in figure",
    "[ fig : example ] , we give an example of periodic , reducible and pseudo - anosov braids whose closure represents @xmath8-torus knot . therefore the following question naturally arises :    _ when the nielsen - thurston classification of braids completely determine the geometrical types of its closure ? _    theorem [ thm : main2 ] partially answers the question .",
    "-torus knots , width=226 ]    [ thm : main2 ] let @xmath2 be a braid whose closure is a knot . if @xmath5_{d } \\geq 3 $ ] , following holds :    1 .",
    "@xmath7 is periodic if and only if @xmath4 is a torus knot .",
    "2 .   @xmath7 is reducible if and only if @xmath4 is a satellite knot .",
    "3 .   @xmath7 is pseudo - anosov if and only if @xmath4 is a hyperbolic knot .",
    "especially , under this assumption , satellite knots are all braided - satellite .",
    "we recall that satellite knot @xmath9 is called braided satellite if @xmath9 admit closed braid representatives whose axis does not intersect some essential tori in the complement of @xmath9 .",
    "this theorem implies , under the condition @xmath5_{d } \\geq 3 $ ] , the nielsen - thurston classification of braid groups and the geometric classification of their closures are in one - to - one correspondence . in @xcite",
    ", los studied the relationship between these two classifications in the case knots are represented by closed braid with minimum braid index .",
    "main result of @xcite shows under the condition of braid index , two classifications are related each other by performing exchange move . however , in general to determine braid index of given knots or links are very difficult question and to see whether or not given braids admit exchange move is also difficult , so the relationships between two classifications can not be seen directly . in this",
    "regard , theorem [ thm : main2 ] gives more general and direct condition for the question .",
    "we will give a proof of theorem [ thm : main2 ] in section 5 , and in this section we also give concrete method to create hyperbolic knots via nielsen - thurston theory .",

    "he also would like to thank eiko kin for useful conversations .",
    "in this section we review some of fundamental facts of dehornoy ordering and dehornoy floor .",
    "braid group @xmath1 is , by definition , a group which is presented by @xmath10 geometrically , elements of braid group @xmath2 are represented by braided @xmath11-strands which move from above to below , oriented downward . by connecting their endpoints of strands canonically , we obtain an oriented link . we denote this link by @xmath4 and call _ closed braid _ or _ closure _ of @xmath7 .",
    "we call the braid @xmath12 _ garside s fundamental braid _ and denote it by @xmath13 .",
    "the garside fundamental braid@xmath13 plays an important role in braid groups .",
    "it is known that @xmath14 generates the center of @xmath1 , which is an infinite cyclic group . for these basic facts about braid group ,",
    "see @xcite .      in this section",
    "we give a brief exposition of left - invariant total ordering of braid groups called dehornoy ordering , and define dehornoy floor .",
    "dehornoy floor is first introduced in @xcite , though they do not use term dehornoy floor .",
    "this is a measure of how far braid is from the identity elements with respect to dehornoy ordering and can be seen as some kinds of complexity of braids .",
    "we describe fundamental results about dehornoy floor , proved in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a braid @xmath2 is called @xmath15-@xmath16 if @xmath7 can be represented by a word which contains at least one @xmath17 , and contains no @xmath18 for some @xmath19 .",
    "we say @xmath20 is true if and only if the braid @xmath21 is @xmath15-positive .",
    "it is known that the relation @xmath22 defines left - invariant total ordering of @xmath1 ; that is , @xmath22 is total ordering and if braids @xmath23 satisfy @xmath24 , then for all braid @xmath25 , @xmath26 holds .",
    "we call this ordering _ dehornoy ordering_. dehornoy ordering has following nice property , called",
    "_ property @xmath27 _ or _",
    "subword property_.    [ prop : property - s ] for any braids @xmath28 and @xmath19 , @xmath29 holds .    as we mentioned at introduction , there are many other interpretation and definition of dehornoy ordering .",
    "see @xcite for those other definitions and meanings .",
    "we will describe one of the geometrical definition later .",
    "using dehornoy ordering , we define dehornoy floor of braids @xmath5_{d}$ ] as follows .",
    "dehornoy floor @xmath5_{d}$ ] of braid @xmath2 is a minimal non - negative integer @xmath30 which satisfies @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "now we remark one important facts",
    ". we must be careful that when we think about dehornoy floor , which @xmath1 a braid @xmath7 belongs to is very important .",

    "if we use braid groups to describe links , the number of strands are always implicit , so there might be no confusion about the number of braid strands .",
    "so in most cases , we omit to write which @xmath1 a braid @xmath7 belongs to",
    ". we also remark that dehornoy floor is not a conjugacy invariant of braids .",
    "for example , 3-braid @xmath36 has dehornoy floor @xmath37 but its conjugation @xmath38 has zero dehornoy floor .",
    "this is mainly because dehornoy ordering is not right - invariant ; that is , it does not hold that for every @xmath25 , @xmath39 whenever @xmath20 . thus , dehornoy floor is far from knot invariant .",
    "the most important property of dehornor floor is that it can be seen as some kinds of restriction for admissibility of braid moves .",

    "we remark that dehornoy floor is not a conjugacy invariant but proposition [ prop : dehornoyfloor ] ( 2 ) shows taking conjugate changes dehornoy floor at most by one .",
    "our definition of dehornoy floor is slightly different from one in @xcite .",
    "our definition is rather after @xcite .",
    "we adopt this definition because for application of knot theory , this formulation seems to be more natural and makes statement of results simple .",

    "now , take annulus @xmath152 obtained by attaching two bc - annuli along their c - circle boundaries .",
    "each component of @xmath153 has two vertices . by cutting @xmath152 along the arc which connects two vertices which lies different components of @xmath154 , as shown in figure [ fig : be - tile ] , we obtain two 2-cells , called _ be - tile_. these cutting arcs are called _ e - edge_. now decomposition into be - tile and bb - tile determines cellular decomposition of @xmath0 .        note",
    "that there might exist be - tile which has no singular point or two singular points , but from construction of be - tile , be - tile with zero singularity and be - tile with two singularity must occur in pairs in each neighbor of vertex , so the notion of vertex and valance defined in section 3 coincide with the usual meaning of vertex and valance in this cellular decomposition .",
    "then we see the same euler characteristic formula holds :    [ lem : eulerform - nmixed ] let @xmath0 be a normal mixed foliated surface with genus @xmath155 and @xmath156 be a number of vertex whose valance is @xmath99 in cellular decomposition described above .",
    "then ,    @xmath157 holds .",
    "a be - tile has exactly four 1-cells in its boundary and each 1-cell is boundary of two 2-cells , so the same argument in proof of lemma [ lem : eulerform - tiled ] gives desired result .",
    "so we can estimate minimal valance of vertices in case of normal mixed foliation by using lemma [ lem : eulerform - nmixed ] as in the tiled case . to estimate general mixed foliated case , we perform `` preimage surgery '' to delete cc - singularities .",
    "let @xmath0 be a mixed foliated surface and we denote @xmath158 by the preimage of @xmath0 ; that is , @xmath159 is a foliated surface forgetting information of embedding .",
    "let @xmath160 be an one of the c - circle boundary of cc - pants @xmath161 .",
    "@xmath160 is also a boundary of some other cc - pants or bc - annulus @xmath162 .",
    "we modify foliations of @xmath161 and @xmath162 as shown in figure [ fig : preimagesurgery ] by filling @xmath160 by discs and changes foliation in @xmath161 and @xmath162 , according to type of regions .",
    "since modified regions are trivially foliated , these regions are amalgamated to some other regions and they disappears .",
    "moreover , this operation can be done so that obtained surface is connected by choosing c - circle boundary @xmath160 appropriately and reduces genus of @xmath159 because all c - circle in the foliation is non - null homotopic in @xmath159 .",
    "thus , this modification deletes two regions @xmath161 and @xmath162 , hence two singular points .",
    "we call this operation _ preimage surgery _ because we can regard this modification as surgery of @xmath159 along c - circle @xmath160 .",
    "we remark that preimage surgery is not realizable as a surgery of embedded surface @xmath0 , because we can not choose take a disc bounded by @xmath160 without intersecting original surface @xmath0 in @xmath163 .",
    "since each preimage surgery reduces a genus of @xmath159 , after @xmath164 preimage surgery we obtain normal mixed foliated surface @xmath165 .",
    "as we remarked before , @xmath165 can not be realized as an embedded surface , but we can use the arguments of proof of lemma [ lem : eulerform - nmixed ] , because the proof uses only information from cellular decomposition of @xmath165 .",
    "therefore we can use lemma [ lem : eulerform - nmixed ] for @xmath165 to estimate valance of vertices of preimage - surgered surface @xmath165 .",
    "assume @xmath0 is mixed foliated and after performing preimage surgery @xmath42-times described above , we create abstract foliated surface @xmath165 with no cc - singularity , that is , normal mixed foliated .",
    "let @xmath30 be a minimal valance of vertices of @xmath165 .",
    "then , we trace preimage surgery procedure backwards .",
    "each surgery deletes at most one bc - singularity , so original surface @xmath0 has at most more than @xmath42 bc - singular points than that of @xmath165 . since singular leaf containing bc - singularity has two vertices as its endpoints and there exist at least two vertices in @xmath0 , we conclude minimal valance of vertices in @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath166 .",
    "thus , we only need to estimate @xmath30 to estimate minimal valance of vertices in original surface @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath156 be the number of valance @xmath99 vertices of @xmath165 .",
    "if @xmath110 is non - zero for some @xmath167 , then form the argument above , we conclude the minimal valance of vertices of @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath168 , so @xmath5_{d } < \\frac{3+g}{2 } \\leq 2g+1 $ ] , so we can assume @xmath110 is zero for all @xmath167 . in this case , the euler characteristic formula for @xmath165 become @xmath169 mixed foliated means there exist at least one b - arc in the foliation , so there exist at least two vertices in @xmath165 .",
    "therefore the minimal value of valance of vertices in @xmath165 is less than @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , from our earlier argument , minimal valance of vertices in @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath171 .",
    "now , lemma [ lem : estimate - mixed ] establishes an inequality @xmath5_{d } <",
    "2g-\\frac{3k}{2 } < 2g+1 $ ] .    from statement",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we conclude if @xmath5_{d } \\geq 2g+1 $ ] , then @xmath0 is neither tiled nor mixed - foliated , hence circular - foliated .",
    "this completes proof of theorem [ thm : main1 ]",
    "in this section , we describe an application of theorem [ thm : main1 ] for genus one closed surface , namely , essential torus .",
    "a description of essential torus in closed braid complements is studied in @xcite,@xcite by using braid foliation machinery .",
    "since an essential torus deeply involves the geometry of link complements , we can extract some of geometrical information of closed braids from theorem [ thm : main1 ] .",
    "first of all , we recall the nielsen - thurston classification of braids .",
    "nielsen - thurston theorem states that an isotopy class of orientation preserving homeomorphism @xmath172 $ ] of compact oriented surface @xmath0 , that is , an element of mapping class group @xmath173 of @xmath0 , is classified into following three types :    1 .",
    "_ periodic _ : there exists a positive integer @xmath30 such that @xmath174 is isotopic to the identity .",
    "_ reducible _ : there exist an essential 1-submanifold @xmath175 of @xmath0 , which is invariant under @xmath176 .",
    "pseudo - anosov _ : @xmath176 is isotopic to a pseudo - anosov homeomorphism .",
    "we do not describe precise definition of pseudo - anosov homeomorphism , because we do not use it.(see @xcite for more details about nielsen - thurston theory . )",
    "let @xmath51 be a @xmath11-punctured disc .",
    "since braid group @xmath1 is identified with the group of boundary - fixing isotopy class of homeomorphisms of @xmath51 which is identity on @xmath53 , there exist natural projection @xmath177 regarding an element of @xmath1 as an isotopy class of homeomorphism of @xmath51 whose restriction on @xmath53 are not necessarily identity",
    ". therefore we can define the nielsen - thurston classification of braids by taking pull - back of the nielsen - thurston classification of @xmath178 .",
    "concretely , the nielsen - thurston classification of @xmath1 can be described as following way :    1 .",
    "_ periodic _ : some powers of @xmath7 is equal to some powers of garside fundamental braid @xmath13 .",
    "pseudo - anosov _ : its representing homeomorphism is pseudo - anosov .",
    "reducible _ : its representing homeomorphism is reducible .",
    "we remark that the nielsen - thurston classification of mapping class groups has very beautiful connection to the geometry of its mapping torus .",
    "let @xmath0 be a closed surface , @xmath181 be a homeomorphism of @xmath0 and @xmath182 be the mapping torus of @xmath181 .",
    "the topology of mapping torus @xmath182 only depends on the isotopy class of @xmath181 .",
    "it is known that @xmath0 admit a complete hyperbolic structure if and only if @xmath181 is pseudo - anosov and @xmath182 is seifert - fibered if and only if @xmath181 is periodic .",
    "moreover , @xmath182 contains an essential torus ( hence decomposable with respect to geometric decomposition ) if and only if @xmath181 is reducible .",
    "thus , there exist one - to - one correspondence between the nielsen - thurston classification of mapping class group and the geometry of its mapping torus .",
    "hence , in this regard , theorem [ thm : main2 ] can be seen as some generalization of this well - known fact in the knot theory settings .",
    "first we investigate non - braided satellite knots .",
    "recall that a satellite knot @xmath9 is called braided - satellite if its complements has essential tori @xmath183 which is circular foliated under appropriate choice of closed braid representatives of @xmath9 .",
    "in general it is difficult to handle non - braided satellite knot in braid theory , but fortunately they do not appear under assumption of theorem [ thm : main2 ] .        in @xcite , it is proved that if a closure of @xmath7 is a composite knot , then @xmath5_{d}<2 $ ] .",
    "proposition [ prop : nbdsatellite ] can be seen some kind of generalization of this result because composite knots are special types of non - braided satellite knots .",
    "torus knots are exchange - reducible .",
    "that is , for every closed braid representative @xmath4 of @xmath186-torus knot , there exists a sequence of closed braids @xmath187 such that @xmath188 is obtained by performing exchange move or destabilization or isotopy of @xmath189 , and @xmath190 .",
    "first assume @xmath2 and @xmath191 is a torus knot .",
    "if @xmath11 is not the braid index of knot @xmath9 , that is , if @xmath9 can be represented as a closure of other braids which have strictly smaller number of strands , then menasco s theorem says @xmath9 admit exchange move or destabilization , hence by the proposition [ prop : dehornoyfloor ] ( 5 ) , we conclude @xmath5_{d}\\leq 1 $ ] , which contradicts our assumption @xmath5_{d } \\geq 3 $ ] .",
    "therefore we can assume that @xmath11 is braid index of @xmath9 .",
    "in this case , also menasco s theorem says @xmath7 is conjugate to braid @xmath192 for some @xmath81 , hence @xmath7 is periodic .    on the other hand",
    ", it is known that periodic braids are conjugate to braids @xmath193 or @xmath194 for some @xmath40 , both of which represent rotation of disc . since closure of @xmath194",
    "never become a knot , it is obvious that closure of periodic braids represent torus knots .",
    "next assume @xmath184 is a satellite knot .",
    "let @xmath183 be a essential torus in the complement of @xmath9 .",
    "of course there might be some of choice for such torus , we can take arbitrary one .",
    "our assumption @xmath5_{d } \\geq 3 $ ] and theorem [ thm : main1 ] shows @xmath183 is circular - foliated , so intersection of @xmath183 with some fiber @xmath89 gives reducing 1-submanifolds of @xmath7 as a homeomorphism of @xmath51 , hence @xmath7 is reducible .",
    "the converse is trivial .      as a corollary",
    ", we get an infinite , almost disjoint family of hyperbolic knots for each pseudo - anosov element of mapping class group of punctured disc .",
    "although it is known that `` almost all '' prime knots are hyperbolic knot , in general it is not so easy to determine given not is hyperbolic or not .",
    "especially , most of known family of knots known to be hyperbolic are defined through knot diagrams such as alternativeness .",
    "we now construct many families of hyperbolic knot through braid - theoretical approach .",
    "[ cor : c1 ] suppose @xmath172 \\in mcg(d_{n})$ ] be a pseudo - anosov element of mapping class group of @xmath11-punctured disc and @xmath195 be the natural projection .",
    "let @xmath196)=\\ { \\widehat{\\beta } \\;| \\;\\beta \\in \\pi^{-1 } ( [ f]),[\\beta]_{d } \\geq 3 \\ } $ ] .",
    "then @xmath197)$ ] consists of infinite number of distinct hyperbolic knots .",
    "moreover , let @xmath198 \\in mcg(d_{n})$ ] be another pseudo - anosov element which is not conjugate to @xmath172 $ ] in @xmath178 .",
    "then , the intersection of @xmath197)$ ] and @xmath199)$ ] are finite .    since @xmath197)$ ]",
    "consists of pseudo - anosov braids with dehornoy floor larger than three , theorem [ thm : main2 ] shows their closures are all hyperbolic knots .",

    "unfortunately , this too optimistic conjecture is not true .",
    "for example , we can prove figure - eight knot , the most simple hyperbolic knots , do not appear as an element of @xmath197)$ ] . more generally , we can show genus one hyperbolic knots can not be constructed from our method .",
    "this is a corollary of results of our subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "since @xmath81 is prime and @xmath4 is a knot , @xmath7 is never reducible braid .",
    "assume @xmath4 is satellite .",
    "then proposition [ prop : nbdsatellite ] , @xmath4 is braided - satellite , so theorem [ thm : main2 ] means @xmath7 is reducible , which contradicts above . thus , under the assumption of corollary , @xmath4 is either hyperbolic or torus knot and @xmath7 is either periodic or pseudo - anosov , so theorem [ thm : main2 ] establishes the result .",
    "although there is an algorithm to determine nielsen - thurston classification , it requires exponential times with respect to word length of braid . on the other hand , since to determine given braids are periodic or not is easy and it requires only quadratic times , corollary [ cor : c2 ] produces very many hyperbolic knots explicitly and rapidly . in particular , we conclude that for prime @xmath81 , closure of braids @xmath202 satisfying @xmath5_{d } \\geq 2 $ ] are almost all hyperbolic knots .",
