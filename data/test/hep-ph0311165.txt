    "the origin of mass is a central mystery of the standard model ( sm ) . in particular , why are the masses of w , z , and the top quark exceptionally large compared with those of other particles in the sm ?",
    "the idea of the top quark condensate  @xcite explains naturally the large top mass of the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) scale . in the explicit formulation of this idea  @xcite , often called the `` top mode standard model '' ( tmsm ) , the scalar bound state of @xmath9 plays the role of the higgs boson in the sm .",
    "( for reviews , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "there are several problems in the original version of the tmsm : we need to introduce ad hoc four - fermion interactions of the top quark in order to trigger the ewsb .",
    "the top mass @xmath10 , given as a decreasing function of the composite scale @xmath11 , is predicted about 10%30% larger than the experimental value , even if we take @xmath11 to the planck or the gut scale  @xcite .",
    "such a huge @xmath11 also causes a serious fine - tuning problem .    as a possible solution to these problems , following the line of an earlier attempt  @xcite of the tmsm in the tev - scale extra dimension scenario  @xcite , arkani - hamed , cheng , dobrescu and hall ( acdh )",
    "@xcite proposed an interesting version of such where the sm gauge bosons and the third generation of quarks and leptons live in the @xmath12-dimensional bulk , while the first and second generations are confined in the 3-brane ( 4-dimensional minkowski space - time ) .",
    "gauge interactions in higher dimensions than four become strong in a certain high - energy region .",
    "bulk gauge interactions are expected to trigger the top condensation without adding ad hoc four - fermion interactions , in contrast to the original version of the tmsm .",
    "however , the dynamics of bulk gauge theories was not concretely analyzed in ref .",
    "in particular , as it turned out  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the bulk qcd coupling , which is the most relevant interaction for the top condensation , has an ultraviolet fixed point ( uv - fp ) or upper bound within the same @xmath13-scheme of the truncated kaluza - klein ( kk ) effective theory  @xcite as that ref .",
    "@xcite was based on .",
    "thus , it is quite nontrivial whether the top condensation is actually realized or not . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have studied the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath14sb ) in bulk gauge theories , based on the ladder schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation.sb  in other scenario for extra dimensions was investigated in ref .",
    "switching off the electroweak interaction in the bulk , we then found that the bulk qcd coupling can not become sufficiently large to trigger the top condensation for @xmath2 , while the top condensation can be realized for @xmath1 .",
    "for the purpose of model building , we further need to study the effect of the bulk electroweak interactions : since the bulk @xmath15 interaction grows very quickly due to the power - like running behavior and reaches immediately its landau pole @xmath16 , it may affect the most favored channel for condensate , i.e. , the most attractive channel ( mac )  @xcite . we also need to study whether or not the prediction of the top mass agrees with the experiments .    in this paper , we demonstrate a possibility that the top condensate is actually the mac even including all of the bulk sm gauge interactions .",
    "this is quite nontrivial , because inclusion of the strong bulk @xmath15 interaction may favor the tau condensation rather than the top condensation .",
    "in order for only the top quark to acquire the dynamical mass of the order of the ewsb scale , the binding strength should exceed the critical binding strength @xmath17 only for the top quark ( `` topped mac '' or `` tmac '' ) .",
    "namely , our scenario works only when @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the binding strengths of the top , bottom , and tau condensates at the scale @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we refer to the scale @xmath11 satisfying eq .  ( [ top - cond ] ) as the tmac scale @xmath22 .    for the mac analysis , we study binding strengths @xmath23 by using the one - loop renormalization group equations ( rges ) of dimensionless bulk gauge couplings .",
    "it is in contrast to the analysis of acdh  @xcite where all of bulk gauge couplings are assumed equal ( and strong enough for triggering the ewsb ) . in order to check reliability of our mac analysis",
    ", we also study the regularization - scheme dependence of the binding strengths .",
    "we calculate gauge couplings in two prescriptions , the @xmath13-scheme of the truncated kk effective theory and the proper - time ( pt ) scheme  @xcite .",
    "there are some varieties in the estimation of @xmath17 : the naive dimensional analysis ( nda )  @xcite implies @xmath24 , while the ladder sd equation yields much smaller value @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "as the estimate of @xmath17 increases in eq .",
    "( [ top - cond ] ) , the region of the tmac scale gets squeezed .",
    "even if we adopt the lowest possible value of @xmath17 given by the ladder sd equation  @xcite , we find that _ the tmac scale does not exist for the simplest scenario with @xmath2_. on the other hand , _ the tmac scale does exist in @xmath1 _ for the value of the ladder sd equation , @xmath26@xmath27 , where the compactification scale @xmath28 is taken to be 1100 tev .",
    "for @xmath3 , the mac analysis significantly depends on the regularization scheme .",
    "once we obtain the tmac scale @xmath22 , we can easily predict the top mass @xmath10 and the higgs mass @xmath29 by using the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for the top yukawa and higgs quartic couplings , and the compositeness conditions  @xcite at the scale @xmath30 .",
    "this is in contrast to the earlier approach  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) where the composite scale @xmath11 is treated as an adjustable free parameter and fixed so as to reproduce the experimental value of @xmath10 .",
    "without such an adjustable parameter , we predict the top quark mass @xmath31 for @xmath1 and @xmath32 1100 tev .",
    "this agrees with the experimental value , @xmath33 gev  @xcite .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath10 near the compactification scale @xmath28 is governed by the quasi infrared fixed point ( ir - fp ) for the top yukawa coupling @xmath34  @xcite , which is approximately obtained as @xmath35 with the 4-dimensional qcd coupling @xmath36 , the number of color @xmath37 , the quadratic casimir of the fundamental representation @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the suppression factor @xmath40 in @xmath34 arises from one - loop effects of the bulk top quark which is equivalent to a tower of kk modes ( massive vector - like fermions ) .",
    "the mechanism suppressing the top mass prediction is thus similar to that of the top seesaw  @xcite .",
    "we also predict the higgs boson mass as @xmath41 thanks to the ir - fp property , the prediction for @xmath10 and @xmath29 is stable .",
    "the higgs boson with such a characteristic mass can be distinguished clearly from that of supersymmetric or other typical dynamical ewsb models simply through its mass determination in experiments .",

    "<S> we perform the most attractive channel ( mac ) analysis in the top mode standard model with tev - scale extra dimensions , where the standard model gauge bosons and the third generation of quarks and leptons are put in @xmath0 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> in such a model , bulk gauge couplings rapidly grow in the ultraviolet region . in order to make the scenario viable , </S>",
    "<S> only the attractive force of the top condensate should exceed the critical coupling , while other channels such as the bottom and tau condensates should not . </S>",
    "<S> we then find that the top condensate can be the mac for @xmath1 , whereas the tau condensation is favored for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis for @xmath3 strongly depends on the regularization scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we predict masses of the top @xmath4 and the higgs @xmath5 , @xmath6 gev and @xmath7 gev for @xmath1 , based on the renormalization group for the top yukawa and higgs quartic couplings with the compositeness conditions at the scale where the bulk top condenses . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs boson in such a characteristic mass range will be immediately discovered in @xmath8 once the lhc starts . </S>"
