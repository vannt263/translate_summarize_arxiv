    "now , the interaction couples only @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for each @xmath18 , which are the eigenstates of the noninteracting hamiltonian @xmath19 .",
    "the whole hilbert space can then be decomposed into the subspaces formed by these states which can be diagonalized analytically .",

    "<S> we present analytical solutions to three qubits and a single - mode cavity coupling system beyond the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) . </S>",
    "<S> the zeroth - order approximation , equivalent to the adiabatic approximation , works well for arbitrary coupling strength for small qubit frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the first - order approximation , called the generalized rotating - wave approximation ( grwa ) , produces an effective solvable hamiltonian with the same form as the ordinary rwa one and exhibits substantial improvements of energy levels over the rwa even on resonance . based on these analytical eigen - solutions , we study both the bipartite entanglement and genuine multipartite entanglement ( gme ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of these two kinds of entanglements using the grwa are consistent with the numerical exact ones . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the well - known sudden death of entanglement occurs in the bipartite entanglement dynamics but not in the gme dynamics . </S>"
