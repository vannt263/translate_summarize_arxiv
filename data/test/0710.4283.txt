    "today we confront the challenge in cosmology of explaining the observation that , in the recent past , our universe has experimented a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "this acceleration is attributed to the mysterious dark energy ( for a review see @xcite ) , whose understanding is nowadays a major problem . although the simplest candidate to play the role of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath0 allowed by einstein equations , its smallness @xmath1 is very problematic as it requires an extreme fine - tuning .",
    "besides , recent observations indicate that a time dependent equation of state is possible . in this case ,",
    "the simplest approach is to consider a scalar field to play the role of dark energy .",
    "there are many types of such models and an extended literature , we refer only a few works in four of these approaches namely quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyons @xcite and quintom @xcite .",
    "moreover , the snia data admits an equation of state @xmath2 , which is attributed to the so - called phantom dark energy @xcite .",
    "this has the striking feature that its density grows without limit with the expansion of the universe .",
    "usually , this behavior leads to a violation of the weak energy condition and then , to the so - called big rip in a finite time @xcite .",
    "this is true if dark energy satisfies a conservation equation which corresponds to a non - interacting fluid .",
    "now , if dark energy interacts , for example with dark matter , then the energy conservation equation is modified , and it is possible to circumvent the blowing of the dark energy density .",
    "further , there are proposals that can encode the crossing @xmath3 ( dubbed phantom divide ) without violating the weak energy condition @xcite .",
    "this behavior can be exhibited in dark energy - dark matter unified models .",
    "an example of such a model is the chaplygin gas @xcite and its generalization @xcite .",
    "the chaplygin gas has a connection with string theory and can be obtained from the light - cone parametrization of the nambu - goto action , associated to a @xmath4-brane @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a single self - interacting scalar field is responsible for both dark energy and dark matter , giving also the observed accelerated expansion . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", it has been claimed that the galaxy cluster abell a586 exhibits evidence that dark energy and dark matter are interacting .",
    "the authors trace back the coupling to a departure of the equilibrium settled by the virial theorem and show that it could be explained by the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) with dark energy equation of state @xmath3 .    in the light of these last results and the considerations mentioned above , in this paper we will consider the generalized chaplygin gas as a source of dark matter and dark energy which are interacting assuming a time dependent dark energy equation of state with the property to encode the phantom - like behavior .",
    "for simplicity , we will not consider the baryonic or other kind of matter .",
    "a particular and simple ansatz on the separation of the dark energy and dark matter densities is assumed .",
    "we find a phantom - like equation of state for dark energy that crosses the phantom divide @xmath3 in recent epoch .",
    "its associated density smoothly decays with the expansion of the universe ( thus , phantom - like ) .",
    "it is also shown that the normalized densities @xmath5 are in the past in agreement with the @xmath0cdm model , but in the future they enter in a phase of mutual equilibrium , where their final values are practically the same as today .",
    "this indicate a scaling solution , similar to that obtained in @xcite , where it was assumed a stationary dark energy which could solve the coincidence problem . also , we find a coupling that it is in agreement with one would expect in relation with the coincidence problem .",
    "we organized the present paper as follows : in section 2 , we briefly revisit the unified generalized chaplygin gas . in section 3 , we construct the model by splitting the total density into dark energy and dark matter components , by means of our assumption . in section 4",
    ", we find a dark energy equation of state and we analyze its general behavior .",
    "we obtain also the involved densities explicitly in function of the scale factor , and show that the model has a scaling solution . at the end of this section , we plotted the relevant quantities for best fitted values of the parameters .",
    "finally , we present the conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in the gcg model the pressure @xmath6 of the fluid has the following form @xcite@xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total density and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are parameters . for @xmath11",
    "we recover the standard chaplygin gas and @xmath12 corresponds to the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "following the definition @xmath13 , we read from ( [ presseff ] ) the gcg equation of state ( eos)@xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the total density today , given by @xmath17 in terms of the hubble constant @xmath18 in a flat universe . in @xcite the ranges of the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 have been analyzed , and it is argued that the observations favor @xmath21 with @xmath22 , although @xmath21 with @xmath23 is still possible . in this work , we will apply our results in both regions .",
    "the density satisfies the conservation equation@xmath24 using ( [ presseff ] ) in this last equation , we find the density in terms of the scale factor@xmath25   ^{\\frac{1}% { 1+\\alpha}}\\rho_{0 } , \\label{denseff}%\\ ] ] where we normalized the scale factor as @xmath26 today .",
    "the gcg eos ( [ eoseff ] ) in terms of the scale factor is@xmath27 it is easy to see that with the restriction @xmath28 , this eos is constrained to the interval @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the model is in general of quintessence and excludes the phantom region @xmath30 , with a phase of acceleration for @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , it allows us to interpret the fluid as cold matter @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and as dark energy @xmath34 for @xmath35 and it can be considered as an unified model of matter and dark energy . if we assume in the simplest case a eos for dark energy @xmath3 , the resulting model gives slight deviations of the @xmath0cdm model @xcite .",
    "however , due to the fact that the model is a mixture of dark matter and dark energy , we can not exclude a priori the possibility that the dark energy eos @xmath36 , has a phantom phase . as the observations tend to support ,",
    "it is possible that the eos for dark energy evolves in time and eventually crosses the boundary @xmath3 , at a recent epoch .",
    "in fact , as we will see below , that this is the case in the approach considered in this work .",
    "let us consider the friedmann equation,@xmath37 where @xmath38 is the hubble parameter and @xmath8 is the total density .",
    "we assume that this density is decomposed as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the densities of dark energy and dark matter respectively .",
    "thus for cold dark matter , the conservation equation ( [ chapcons ] ) becomes @xmath42 the problem now is to have a relationship between dark energy and dark matter in order to solve ( [ interacting ] ) . to do it , in this work",
    "we will assume a particular and simple ansatz which gives results in agreement with the observations , as follows , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant .",
    "we will show that this is consistent with the usual behavior of dark energy , suppressed at early times , and then increasing and triggering the acceleration at late times .",
    "we should note that equation ( [ interacting ] ) has also been used in connection with the generalized chaplygin gas in holographic models @xcite .",
    "in contrast with our proposal ( [ fundamen ] ) , in these kind of models a holographic dark energy density is assumed to be able to relate it with the dark matter content . under ansatz ( [ fundamen ] )",
    ", we find the normalized densities@xmath45 which clearly satisfy the flat universe constraint @xmath46 .",
    "if we impose the restriction @xmath47 , then we have from ( [ normdens])@xmath48   .",
    "\\label{branedens}%\\ ] ]",
    "under the assumption of cold dark matter , we can identify the pressures @xmath49 @xmath50 . therefore,@xmath51 and the dark energy eos is,@xmath52 after using ( [ eoseff ] ) , ( [ normdens ] ) and ( [ branedens ] ) in the last equation , we obtain@xmath53 \\left (   \\frac{\\rho_{0}}{\\rho}\\right )   ^{1+\\alpha}. \\label{eosde}%\\ ] ] substituting ( [ denseff ] ) in this equation , we get the dark energy eos @xmath54   , \\label{eosde2}%\\ ] ] where @xmath55>0.\\label{x}\\ ] ] we can see from ( [ eosde ] ) that @xmath36 decreases as @xmath56 increases .",
    "moreover , for enough large values of @xmath56 , we find in general that @xmath2 .",
    "if we consider ,",
    "the today value @xmath57 , we get @xmath58   , \\label{eosdetoday}%\\ ] ] which , by considering the most probable values of @xmath59 given in @xcite , we show below that it fulfills as well the phantom divide condition @xmath60 . notice that once the boundary @xmath3 is crossed , dark energy behaves as phantom - like for all the rest of the evolution of the universe and it never returns to the quintessence region @xmath61 . moreover , in the limit @xmath62 , the dark energy eos consistently approaches @xmath63 .",
    "scaling solutions are interesting as far as they could solve the coincidence problem @xcite . in the scaling regime ,",
    "the ratio @xmath64 is a non - zero constant .",
    "thus , dark energy and dark matter remain of the same order .",
    "we will see that our model has an asymptotic scaling region for @xmath56 large . in order to see it , we compute the dark energy density by means of ( [ denseff ] ) and ( [ branedens])@xmath65   .",

    "indeed , a simple calculation reproduces the gcg density ( [ denseff ] ) . substituting ( [ denseff ] ) into ( [ normdens ] ) , we get the dark energy normalized density in terms of the scale factor@xmath67 as well as the dark matter normalized density @xmath68 then , the ratio is obtained @xmath69   , \\label{ratio}%\\ ] ] which clearly differs from the non scaling models @xmath0cdm and gcg , with @xmath70 , and @xmath71 ( see @xcite ) respectively . for both models @xmath3 .    in our case",
    ", we find that this ratio is today @xmath72   , \\label{ratiotoday}%\\ ] ] and for large values of @xmath56 , we have a scaling solution @xmath73   .",
    "\\label{ratiofuture}%\\ ] ] we can see that ( [ ratiotoday ] ) and ( [ ratiofuture ] ) are practically the same for the allowed values of @xmath74",
    ". therefore , dark energy and dark matter are of the same order today and in the future , which alleviates the coincidence problem .",
    "further , the usual small  time interval that takes the transition between dark matter and dark energy ( present for instance , in the @xmath0cdm model ) , in our case stretches to infinity , in such a way that the dark energy and the dark matter densities tend asymptotically to constant values @xmath75   , \\quad \\rho_{dm}\\simeq\\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\left [   \\sqrt{1+\\frac{4\\rho_{0}a_s^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha } } } { \\lambda } } -1\\right ]   ^{2}. \\label{rhos}\\ ] ]    let us now consider the coupled equation for the interacting model ( [ interacting ] ) in the scaling regime , when @xmath41 and @xmath40 are practically constant .",
    "then , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , therefore @xmath78 .",
    "thus , considering the eos @xmath79 , we get in general for this model @xmath80 hence , @xmath81 thus , in the scaling region dark energy eos is phantom - like . because the ratio @xmath64 in the future is practically the same as today , we can put @xmath82 in ( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "then we get the lower bound @xmath83 . in this limit ,",
    "the total density of the gcg model ( [ denseff ] ) is @xmath8 @xmath84 , and the universe enters in the de - sitter phase @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the universe expands accelerated forever .",
    "now , we can analyze the coupling between dark energy and dark matter in more detail .",
    "we will follow the definition of the coupling given in @xcite @xmath87where @xmath88 is the coupling . making the change @xmath89 and using ( [ fundamen ] ) we find @xmath90 where we introduced the ratio @xmath91 .",
    "we note that both fluids always interact ( @xmath92 ) , only when @xmath36 passes through @xmath93 they uncouple .",
    "also notice that the coupling evolves from a negative value through a positive value , once the condition @xmath94 is satisfied .",
    "eventually when the approximation ( [ ratio2 ] ) is valid , this coupling approaches to a non vanishing constant @xmath95 for large values of @xmath56 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the fluid enters in the scaling regime .",
    "it is interesting to compare our model with the work in @xcite where @xmath36 is considered constant . in that case",
    "the coupling @xmath96 ( we denote with primes the quantities in that work ) results in @xmath97 which for the gcg model with @xmath98 , one has @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "now , using ( [ coupling ] ) for our case and a similar set of equations for the model in @xcite we find the relation between @xmath88 and @xmath96 @xmath101 which shows that these couplings are different .",
    "note , however , that both couplings coincide if @xmath3 and the densities with primes and those without primes coincide as well .      for practical purposes and in order to be specific",
    ", we shall take numerical values for the parameters involved in the model .",
    "taking the present values for the fractional densities as @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we obtain from ( [ normdens ] ) @xmath104 .",
    "the dark energy eos ( [ eosdetoday ] ) is today approximately @xmath105 , independent of @xmath20 , and is phantom - like for @xmath106 .",
    "this falls quite well in the region of confidence given by the constraints on the observations for a flat universe @xcite .",
    "we will take the best fitted values in the two parametrizations : @xmath107 , @xmath108 for the range @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , @xmath111 for the range @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "in figure 1 , we show the phantom - like behavior of @xmath36 .",
    "we see that it crosses the phantom divide at @xmath112 for @xmath108 and has a value @xmath113 today . in the case",
    "@xmath111 , it crosses at @xmath114 and has a value @xmath115 today . in figure 2",
    ", we plot the quotient of the dark matter over dark energy densities for the same values as in fig .",
    "1 . we see that it approaches to a non vanishing constant limit as the universe expands , and it remains constant in this region .",
    "further , from ( [ ratiofuture ] ) we have in this region , @xmath116 for @xmath108 and @xmath117 for @xmath111 . in figure 3",
    ", we plot the coupling for the same choice of the parameters .",
    "as we can see , the coupling is constrained to @xmath118 .",
    "finally , in figure 4 we plot @xmath119 and @xmath120 . in the past",
    "they behave as in the @xmath0cdm model , but in the future for @xmath108 they approach to the limits @xmath121 and @xmath122 whereas for @xmath111 they approach to @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "these are almost the same values as the ones at present .    .",
    "the solid line corresponds to @xmath108 and @xmath125 . in this case",
    "dark energy eos has a value @xmath126 today .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath111 and @xmath110 and @xmath127 today . in both cases",
    "the phantom divide is crossed recently.,width=453,height=302 ]     vs. log@xmath56 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to @xmath108 and @xmath125 .",

    "the dashed lines correspond to @xmath111 and @xmath110 .",
    "we see that they behave like the @xmath0cdm model in the past.,width=453,height=302 ]",
    "in this work we have studied the generalized chaplygin gas as an unified self - interacting fluid . by assuming a simple relation between dark matter and dark energy densities ( [ fundamen ] ) we obtain a dark energy eos which exhibits a phantom - like behavior . in the regime of the most probable values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite",
    ", this identification leads to a dark energy eos that crosses the phantom regime @xmath3 in the recent time .",
    "in fact , the numerical values @xmath128 ( for @xmath108 ) and @xmath127 ( for @xmath111 ) are consistent with the observations .",
    "furthermore , the general behavior of the dark energy eos in our model , is in complete agreement with the best fit in @xcite for @xmath103 .",
    "once the dark energy eos crosses the phantom barrier , it never returns to quintessence , giving a phantom - like sector for all the future evolution of the universe .",
    "the densities smoothly decay for all values of the scale factor , thus avoiding a big rip .",
    "we find also , that in contrast with the @xmath0cdm and gcg with @xmath3 models @xcite , our model exhibits a scaling solution when @xmath56 is large , as can be seen from the numerical results .",
    "this regime is achieved once the dark energy eos has crossed the phantom divide , and remains in this way for all the rest of the evolution .",
    "we show also that the coupling between dark energy and dark matter tends to a positive constant in this region and the universe tends to be de - sitter .",
    "this type of solution could provide a clue to solve the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "we also find that the present model with time varying eos and with the assumptions made , could be considered at least as a phenomenological model which could encode the interaction conjectured in @xcite , inferred from the abell cluster a586 .",
