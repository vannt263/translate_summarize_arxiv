    "it is well known that the independent particle shell model , in which nucleons move in a mean field , is not sufficient to describe all basic properties of atomic nuclei .",
    "this failure is a consequence of the strong short - range component of the nn - interaction , which induces into the nuclear wave function components beyond the mean field description .",
    "thus , a careful evaluation of the corresponding short - range correlations ( src ) is inevitable for the understanding of nuclear structure in general @xcite .",
    "electromagnetically induced two - nucleon knockout is apparently the most promising tool to study src @xcite .",
    "however , competing two - body mechanisms like meson - exchange currents ( mec ) , isobar - excitation or final state interactions ( fsi ) need to be taken into account as well in order to obtain a realistic description of the process .",
    "these `` background '' effects must be well under control in order to extract from experiment any information about the fundamental correlations .",
    "this requires a theoretical approach which should be as comprehensive as possible .",

    "recent improvements have been performed with respect to the treatment of fsi @xcite , of the two - nucleon overlap function @xcite , of the @xmath5-current contribution @xcite , and , finally , of the center - of mass ( cm ) effects in the electromagnetic current operator @xcite . with respect to the last two issues ,",
    "only proton - proton ( pp ) knockout has been considered , which is conceptually simpler than proton - neutron ( pn ) knockout due to the suppression of mec contributions . however , pn - knockout is of specific interest for the study of tensor correlations ( tc ) , which are due to the strong tensor component of the pion - exchange contribution to the nn - interaction .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study thoroughly the impact of the above mentioned conceptual improvements on pn - knockout .",
    "the final aim  in the long term run  is to develop an approach which is as comprehensive as practically possible , so that hopefully important conclusions about the structure of correlations can be drawn by comparison with experiment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the main features of the theoretical approach are outlined .",

    "it turns out that a comparable description of the nn - scattering data can be achieved in a conceptually simpler manner considering only @xmath20-exchange . in this choice , which is adopted in the present paper , the coupling constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 are used with a dipole form factor ( @xmath24=@xmath25=1 ) using the cutoffs @xmath26 mev . with respect to the nonresonant pion - in - flight and seagull mec",

    "we denote this choice of parameters for the tb currents as the `` bonn parametrization '' .    in the previous calculations of @xcite",
    "the same coupling constants were used with a simpler regularization in coordinate space , both for the mec and the @xmath5-current , which in practice is similar to the unregularized prescription for the @xmath5-current `` @xmath5(noreg ) '' of @xcite . although a bit simplistic , we denote in the following this previous prescription in shorthand as `` unregularized parametrization '' .",

    "this means that , due to this cm effect , for finite nuclei the ob current can give a contribution to the cross section of two - particle emission independently of correlations .",
    "this effect is similar to the one of the effective charges in electromagnetic reactions  @xcite .",
    "the matrix element of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jq ] ) contains a spurious contribution since it does not vanish when the transition operator is set equal to 1 .",
    "this is due to the lack of orthogonality between the initial and the final state wave functions .",
    "the use of an effective nuclear current operator would remove the orthogonality defect besides taking into account space truncation effects @xcite . in the usual approach , however , the effective operator is replaced by the bare nuclear current operator .",
    "thus , it is this replacement which may introduce a spurious contribution which is not specifically due to the different prescriptions adopted in practical calculations , but is already present in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jq ] ) , when @xmath14 and @xmath15 are eigenfunctions of an energy - dependent feshbach - type hamiltonian corresponding to different energies .",
    "this spuriosity can be removed by subtracting from the transition amplitude the contribution of the ob current without correlations in the nuclear wave functions .",

    "the relevance of this effect was investigated in @xcite for the case of pp - knockout .",

    "moreover , it allows us to include automatically all cm effects via eq .",

    "the main aim of this study is to investigate the effects of cm and orthogonalization in combination with different treatments of correlations in the tof and for different parametrizations of the tb currents .",

    "this kinematical setting , which is particularly favourable to emphasize short - range effects , has been widely investigated in our previous work , both for pp- and pn - knockout @xcite , and is very interesting from the experimental point of view .",

    "large discrepancies , both in shape and magnitude , are found between theoretical and experimental cross sections at low missing momenta .",

    "[ pncm9 ] , where the cross section of the reaction @xmath0o(@xmath3,pn)@xmath2n to the @xmath4 state has been calculated with an incident photon energy @xmath50 mev in a coplanar symmetrical kinematics , where the two nucleons are ejected at equal energies and equal but opposite angles with respect to the momentum transfer . in this",
    "kinematical setting different values of @xmath40 are obtained changing the scattering angles of the two outgoing nucleons . in this case",
    "the cross sections are practically unaffected by the use of orthogonalized s.p . bound and scattering wave functions and also",
    "the effect of nn - fsi is small .",
    "the results are sensitive to the tb currents and to their treatment .",
    "the cross sections calculated with the sf - b overlap function for the two parametrizations are compared in the left and right panels . with the bonn parametrization",
    "the enhancement produced by the tb currents in the cross section is within a factor of 2 and the main contribution to this enhancement is given by the seagull current . a strong enhancement of the @xmath5-current contribution is produced by the unregularized parametrization .",
    "in this case the contribution of the @xmath5-current is dominant and increases the cross section by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "the corresponding cross sections calculated with the sf - cc and sm - src overlap functions for the reaction @xmath0o(@xmath3,pn)@xmath2n to the @xmath4 state in the coplanar symmetrical kinematics with @xmath50 mev are displayed in fig .",

    "[ pncm9 ] , the cross section is sensitive to the parametrization used for the tb currents . when the unregularized parametrization is used in the calculations , the @xmath5-current is dominant both with sm - src and sf - cc . with sm - src the @xmath5-current gives the main contribution also when the bonn parametrization is used . for every tof here",
    "considered the cross sections obtained with the two parametrizations differ by about one order of magnitude , while the shape is not particularly affected by the treatment of the tb currents .",
    "in contrast , large differences , both in the shape and in the magnitude of the calculated cross sections , are obtained with different tof s .",
    "this confirms that the treatment of correlations in the two - nucleon wave function affects all the ingredients of the calculations , and not only the ob current but also the tb currents .",
    "electromagnetically induced two - nucleon knockout is an ideal tool to study the role of correlations in the nuclear wave function going beyond the shell - model approach . in this paper",
    ", we have presented recent improvements in the theoretical model of proton - neutron knockout , which is of specific interest for the study of tensor correlations , which are suppressed in proton - proton knockout .    in comparison with earlier studies ,",
    "a more complete treatment of cm effects has been included in the model . in the cm frame",
    "the transition operator becomes a two - body operator even in the case of a one - body nuclear current . as a consequence",
    ", the one - body current can give a contribution to the cross section of two - particle emission independently of correlations .",
    "these cm effects were not properly taken into account in our previous calculations for pn - knockout .",
    "they have been included in this work enforcing orthogonality between s.p .",
    "initial and final states by means of a gram - schmidt orthogonalization .",
    "this procedure , that was applied in @xcite to pp - knockout , allows us to naturally include all the cm effects as well as to get rid of possible spurious contributions to two - nucleon emission , due to the lack of orthogonality between bound and scattering states obtained by the use of an energy - dependent optical model potential .",
    "the treatment of the two body seagull , pion - in - flight and @xmath5-currents has been improved using a more realistic regularized approach which is consistent with the description of elastic nn - scattering data .",
    "the role of the mutual interaction between the two outgoing nucleons , that is usually ignored , has been reconsidered in combination with the present improvements .",
    "last but not least , the sensitivity of the cross sections to nn - correlations has been studied comparing results obtained with different two - nucleon overlap functions , where correlations are included with more refined or simpler approaches .",
    "it turns out that the effect of these different aspects strongly depends on the chosen kinematics . in the super - parallel kinematics , which is of particular interest with respect to experiment ,",
    "the cm effects included with the enforced orthogonalization lead to a dramatic increase , up to an order of magnitude , of the contribution of the one - body current , which becomes dominant in the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pn)@xmath2n reaction . in the final cross section the enhancement is particularly large for the transition to the @xmath4 ( 3.95 mev ) excited state of @xmath2n and for low values of the missing momentum . for different final states or in different kinematics the influence of these effects is small or even negligible . in particular , it is negligible when the cross section is dominated by the two - body currents , that are not sensibly affected by the orthogonalization procedure .",
    "the regularized treatment of the two - body currents leads in general to a dramatic reduction of the @xmath5-current contribution with respect to the results obtained with the previous treatment .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding effects on the nonresonant seagull and pion - in - flight meson - exchange currents are of minor importance .",
    "the difference due to the regularized and unregularized parametrizations on the final cross section depends on the role played by the @xmath5-current . in the super - parallel kinematics for the ( e , e@xmath1pn ) reaction ,",
    "the latter is only of minor importance so that the resulting difference between the different parametrizations is within a factor of about 2 .",
    "larger differences are obtained in the ( @xmath3,pn ) reaction , where in the symmetrical kinematics the regularized parametrization reduces the cross section by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "the effect of the mutual interaction between the two outgoing nucleons is in general moderate although not negligible .",
    "this contribution does not change the qualitative features of the cross sections but it should be evaluated for a more careful comparison with the experimental data .",
    "dramatic differences , both in the shape and magnitude of the calculated cross sections are given , in all the considered situations and kinematics , by different treatments of correlations in the two - nucleon wave function .",
    "correlations affect both one - body and two - body current contributions . a crucial role is played by tensor correlations .",
    "when tensor correlations are neglected in the overlap function the contribution of the one - body current to the cross section is strongly underestimated and becomes always negligible .",
    "the cross sections of the @xmath0o(e , e@xmath1pn)@xmath2n reaction in super - parallel kinematics differ up to about two orders of magnitude depending on whether tensor correlations are taken into account or not .",
    "in addition , also a careful treatment of long - range correlations appears to be essential . in the calculations long - range correlations affect the two - nucleon removal amplitudes .",
    "these amplitudes determine the weights of the partial waves of relative and cm motion in the overlap function and may therefore affect the shape and also the magnitude of the cross section .    in conclusion",
    ", we may expect that the comparison with presently available data may lead to important conclusions about the structure of correlations and therefore to a test of our present understanding of nuclear structure in general .",
