    "on scales larger than a few megaparsecs , pressure forces in the baryonic matter in the universe are negligible , so the evolution of dark and baryonic matter is mainly determined by gravity",
    ". on small scales pressure becomes important and may segregate between the evolution of baryonic and dark matter .",
    "pressure forces , cooling of gas , and star formation feedback , are key ingredients in galaxy formation .",
    "these ingredients combine to cause differences between the distributions of galaxies and dark matter ( biasing ) , even on large scales where these effects are not directly important ( e.g. , kaiser 1984 , dekel & rees 1987 , kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1997 , benson et .",
    "al . 2000 ) . on scales smaller than the jeans length of the photo - heated intergalactic medium ( igm ) ,",
    "pressure forces dominate gravity and can prevent the collapse of gas into dark haloes below a certain mass threshold . for haloes massive enough the temperature of the igm can be neglected and the gas falls into the halo .",
    "the mean free path for collisions between gas particles inside a halo is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the overdensity inside the virial radius and @xmath14 is a typical cross section for collisions in units of @xmath15 .",
    "this is smaller than the virial radius of a typical halo by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , on its infall into the halo , the gas is likely to form shocks and transform its kinetic energy into heat .",
    "the hot dense gas can then cool to form stars which explode and inject energy into the halo gas .",
    "detailed study of these processes under general conditions is not feasible .",
    "one can aim at a global parameterization based on general physical requirements which match observational data ( kauffman , white , guiderdoni 1993 , somerville & primack 1999 , cole et .",
    "al . 1994 ) .",
    "another route would be to study special aspects which can be treated by either numerical or analytical methods .",
    "here we focus on the collapse of the baryonic gas in an einstein - de sitter universe , ignoring the gas initial temperature , cooling and heating processes .",
    "we assume that the collapse initiates from a symmetric scale free density peak , and that the velocity of each shell in the peak is taken to match the general expansion of the universe .",
    "the energy of each shell is negative and it will expand up to a maximum distance before it starts falling towards the center of the perturbation .",
    "the maximum distance is termed the turnaround radius .",
    "shell crossing is not allowed and the collapse can proceed in two distinct ways , either a shock wave forms , or shells accumulate at the center . which of these possibilities actually occurs , depends on the physical conditions at the center . if the velocity vanishes at the center than a shock wave forms .",
    "if on the other hand physical conditions allow a non vanishing velocity at the center then the shells accumulate at the center ( bertschinger 1985 ) .",
    "inner boundary conditions can be arranged so that a shock is accompanied by the accumulation of central mass , but a proper stability analysis is needed to determine whether or not this is possible ( bertschinger 1985 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on shocked collapses without the formation of a central mass .",
    "since the initial gas pressure is negligible , the collapse eventually develops in a self - similar way where the only relevant scale at any time is the radius of the shell at maximum expansion .",
    "bertschinger ( 1985 ) , and forcada - miro & white ( 1997 ) have studied similarity solutions in spherically symmetric perturbations with initial relative mass excess @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , respectively . here",
    "we derive similarity solutions in planar , cylindrical , and spherical geometries , for the collapse of a perturbation with @xmath18 for any @xmath19 and adiabatic index @xmath2 .    in section [ equations ]",
    "we write the equations of motion for symmetric perturbations in planar , cylindrical , and spherical geometry . in section [ asymptotic ]",
    "we discuss the asymptotic behaviour of the fluid variables near the center , in the case of shocked collapse . in section [ numerical ] we present results of numerical integrations of the equations . in section [ asymptotic : dm ] we derive asymptotic behaviour of the fluid variables in a universe dominated by collisionless dark matter . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the results and their potential astrophysical consequences .",
    "we write the newtonian equations of motion governing the adiabatic collapse of symmetric perturbations in a collisional fluid ( gas ) of adiabatic index @xmath6 and zero initial pressure . except section [ asymptotic : dm ] , we restrict the analysis here and throughout to the collapse in a flat universe containing collisional gas only . the initial gas pressure is zero , so the expansion scale factor of the universe is @xmath20 , the hubble function is @xmath21 , and the background density is @xmath22 .",
    "denote by @xmath23 and @xmath24 the physical position and velocity of a gas shell , where @xmath25 is the symmetry center of the perturbation .",
    "further , let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be the gas density and pressure at @xmath23 . as in fillmore & goldreich ( 1984 )",
    "define the mass within a distance @xmath23 from the symmetry center by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , and 3 refer , respectively , to planar , cylindrical , and spherical perturbations .",
    "the mass within a fixed shell varies with time like @xmath30 , because of the hubble expansion along @xmath31 of the axes . in this notation ,",
    "the equations of motion are , the continuity equation , @xmath32 euler , @xmath33 adiabatic condition , @xmath34 and the relation , @xmath35    these equations are satisfied everywhere except at the shock where the fluid variables are described by jump conditions obtained from mass , momentum , and energy conservation .",
    "the initial conditions leading to self - similar collapse are specified at an early time close to zero , @xmath36 , as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mean density contrast interior to @xmath23 , and @xmath10 . for cosmological initial conditions",
    "the initial density contrast must be tiny , so we will be interested in the solution in the region @xmath39 .",
    "a perturbation with @xmath40 can be realized by placing a high narrow positive density peak at the center ( @xmath41 ) of a symmetric void with local density contrast @xmath42 .",
    "the condition ( [ inivel ] ) means that a gas shell at @xmath23 moves initially with the general universal expansion .",
    "this condition can be relaxed to allow for a non vanishing initial zero peculiar velocity according to late time linear theory ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "however , this does not affect the details of the collapse ( peebles 1980 , bertschinger 1985 ) , so we use ( [ inivel ] ) which is commonly adopted in the literature .",
    "bertschinger ( 1985 ) and white & forcada ( 1997 ) , respectively , considered the collapse of spherical perturbations with @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eom1][eom4 ] ) together with the initial conditions ( [ inid][inip ] ) are insufficient to completely determine the evolution of the perturbation .",
    "still missing is an inner boundary condition specifying the velocity and mass at @xmath45 , for @xmath46 . for a shock to develop without the accumulation of a central mass ( a black hole for @xmath47 ) we must have @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "relaxing the condition @xmath50 leads to a non - vanishing central mass with or without the presence of a shock .    in a critical density universe ( @xmath51 )",
    "the only length scale relevant to the collapse is the scale of non - linearity . at any time ,",
    "@xmath52 , this scale can be defined as the distance of the shell at the maximum expansion , i.e. , the shell with @xmath53 ( gunn 1977 , fillmore & goldreich 1984 , bertschinger 1985 ) .",
    "this radius is termed the current turnaround radius , @xmath54 .",
    "starting from tiny initial density contrast , the mean overdensity ( density in units of @xmath55 ) interior to @xmath54 is a fixed number independent of time . for time",
    "@xmath56 , when shells with @xmath39 reach their turnaround , the collapse develops a self - similar behaviour that depends on @xmath23 and @xmath52 through the combination @xmath57 .",
    "the turnaround radius @xmath54 is given by ( e.g. , fillmore & goldreich 1984 ) , @xmath58 where , @xmath59 for @xmath60 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the turnaround radius grows faster than the scale factor @xmath61 .",
    "this is because the mass , @xmath62 , interior to @xmath63 must grow with time while the mass , @xmath64 , inside a fixed shell in a homogeneous universe is constant . for @xmath65",
    "the turnaround radius grows faster than @xmath52 reaching the horizon scale in finite time .",
    "when this happens relativistic description must be used and @xmath63 ceases to be the only scale in the problem ( fillmore & goldreich 1984 ) .    the equations can be cast into a non - dimensional form using the scaled variables @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 defined by ( bertschinger 1985 ) , @xmath70 expressed in terms of these variables , the equations ( [ eom1]-[eom4 ] ) become , respectively , @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 where the prime symbol denotes derivatives with respect to @xmath75 .",
    "we will mainly be concerned with solutions for shocked collapse with vanishing mass at the center .",
    "the inner boundary condition appropriate for this collapse are vanishing mass and velocity at @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath77 self - similarity implies that the shock appears at fixed @xmath78 , so the physical radius of the shock @xmath79 and its non - dimensional speed is @xmath80 . at the surface of the shock",
    "the fluid variables satisfy the jump conditions obtained from mass , momentum , and energy conservation . in terms of the non - dimensional fluid variables ,",
    "the jump conditions appropriate for an adiabatic shock are , @xmath81 where the superscripts of the minus and plus signs refer to pre- and post - shock quantities . in employing energy conservation",
    "we have taken @xmath82 as the non - dimensional internal energy per unit mass .    in section",
    "[ numerical ] we will find numerical solutions satisfying the requirements for shocked collapse without a central mass . except spherical perturbations with @xmath83 only one value @xmath84 can yield solutions satisfying these requirements .",
    "spherical perturbations with @xmath83 allow a range of values for @xmath84 . before presenting the numerical solutions we derive in the next section the asymptotic behaviour of the fluid variables near the center , and two integrals of motion which will be used as a check on the numerical solutions .",
    "solutions to ( [ a1][a4 ] ) with the appropriate jump and boundary conditions for all @xmath85 will be found by numerical integration .",
    "we present here an analytic treatment of the equations to derive the asymptotic behaviour of the fluid variables near @xmath45 , and two integrals of motion ( e.g. , bertschinger 1983 , 1985 ) .",
    "we restrict the analysis shocked collapses satisfying the inner boundary condition ( [ innerb ] ) .",
    "all fluid variables can be expressed in terms of an auxiliary function @xmath86 as follows .",
    "@xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are constants .",
    "the fluid variables in ( [ b6][b5 ] ) satisfy the non - dimensional equations ( [ a1 ] ) , ( [ a3 ] ) , and ( [ a4 ] ) for any functional form of @xmath90 .",
    "the function @xmath90 is then specified by only one equation , the non - dimensional euler equation ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "two integrals of motion can immediately be found from ( [ b6][b5 ] ) .",
    "these are the mass and entropy integrals of motion ( bertschinger 1983 , 1985 ) , @xmath91 where all fluid variable are evaluated at any @xmath75 inside the shock .",
    "since @xmath92 , the entropy integral of motion means that the entropy @xmath93 is an increasing function of the mass and hence @xmath75 .",
    "the auxiliary function greatly simplifies the derivation of the asymptotic behaviour of the non - dimensional fluid variables near @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath50 and @xmath94 , equations ( [ b6 ] ) and ( [ b5 ] ) imply that , to first order , @xmath95 must approach @xmath96 as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is an arbitrary constant . substituting this expression for @xmath90 in ( [ b6 ]  [ b5 ] ) , yields @xmath99 and",
    "the asymptotic exponents are expressed in terms of the coefficient @xmath98 as @xmath100 these relations have been obtained without using the euler equation ( [ a2 ] ) . in order to determine the exponents uniquely we use the euler equation which adds the following constraints , @xmath101 a value @xmath102 gives @xmath103 and so , by ( [ int : ent ] ) , a negative entropy integral of motion .",
    "but the jump condition ( [ jump3 ] ) gives positive pressure , @xmath104 , just behind the shock and since the density and mass are also positive , the entropy integral ( [ int : ent ] ) must be positive .",
    "so we rule out @xmath105 .",
    "if the solution to ( [ expdelta ] ) , ( [ expeta ] ) , and ( [ expeuler ] ) is @xmath106 then the euler equation also provides the following constraint on the coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath88 , @xmath107 table 1 lists the values of @xmath98 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 in all cases .",

    "a second order calculation gives the upper limit @xmath127 .",
    "solutions exist for any positive @xmath84 smaller than a maximal value which corresponds to the upper limit on @xmath98 .",
    "this means that for @xmath83 a shocked collapse can not be accompanied by the presence of a non - vanishing mass at the center . in the table",
    "we list the asymptotic constants corresponding to @xmath128 , i.e. , the maximal value of @xmath84 for which a shocked collapse occurs .",

    "his numerical solution with @xmath83 seems to correspond to the maximal @xmath84 and yields @xmath129 and @xmath130 , instead of @xmath131 and @xmath132 as listed in table 1 .",

    "the collapse of scale free symmetric perturbations in a an einstein - de sitter universe containing a mixture of gas and collisionless matter is also self - similar .",
    "similarity solutions for mixed collapse are beyond the scope of the present paper . here",
    "we only obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the gas variables in a universe dominated by collisionless matter . for a self - similar collapse to develop",
    ", the two matter components must start with the same initial conditions with zero initial gas pressure .",
    "shells of gas and collisional matter then move together until they reach either a shock in the gas or the region of shell crossing in the collisionless component",

    ". although the global gas mass fraction is negligible , the gas can be gravitationally dominant at the center of the collapse if it has a steeper density profile than the collisionless matter . for the purpose of deriving the asymptotic exponents we proceed assuming that the gravity of the gas is negligible everywhere and check the consistency of this assumption according to the results .",

    "for @xmath189 the density asymptotic exponents of the gas and collisionless matter are identical . for @xmath65",
    "the collisionless matter density profile is steeper .",
    "this is consistent with neglecting the gravity of the gas near the center .",
    "as @xmath125 gas density exponent approaches @xmath190 for @xmath11 and @xmath191 otherwise , so the gas has the same asymptotic profile as the collisionless matter for all @xmath110 .    in cylindrical perturbations with @xmath110 large enough",
    ", the gas has a steeper density profile than the collisionless matter .",
    "this means that virial motions in the collisionless matter are more effective at balancing gravity than the gas pressure force .",
    "so for large @xmath110 the derivation of the asymptotic exponent in section [ asymptotic ] is more suitable .",
    "a steeper gas profile also occurs in planar perturbations with @xmath192 . however the asymptotic constants obtained here and in section [ asymptotic ]",
    "are identical in planar geometry .    in spherical perturbations with @xmath193 ,",
    "the density @xmath26 is constant with time and the temperature @xmath194 diverges like @xmath195 as @xmath196 . to first order in the asymptotic expansion where the gas can be in hydrostatic equilibrium in the dominant potential well of the collisionless matter .",
    "for @xmath11 the density increases with time and the temperature is constant near the center . for comparison , in the absence of collisionless matter , for @xmath197 the temperature decreases inward but the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium to first order in the asymptotic expansion .",
    "the similarity solutions are found for collapse in a flat universe with matter density parameter @xmath198 .",
    "because of birchhoff s theorem , the solutions for spherical collapse are valid in an open universe if the current turnaround radius is well inside the spherical region interior to which the perturbation is bound .",
    "the statement is incorrect for planar and cylindrical perturbations because of the explicit appearance of cosmology dependent terms in the equations of motion ( [ eom1][eom4 ] ) , like @xmath199 in the continuity equation ( [ eom1 ] ) .",
    "the solutions are appropriate for the adiabatic collapse of perturbations with deep gravitational potential so that the initial thermal energy of the gas can be ignored .",
    "such perturbations are probably the seeds for massive galaxies , galaxy groups and clusters . in the intergalactic medium ( igm )",
    "most of the gas is continuously photo - heated and is of moderate density .",
    "there is considerable interest in analytic modelling of the igm in current methods for extracting cosmological information from the lyman forest ( croft et .",
    "1998 , nusser & haehnelt 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "so far these methods have heavily relied on linear analysis ( e.g. , bi , brner , & chu 1992 , gnedin & hui 1998 , nusser 2000 ) and hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , petitjean et .",
    "1995 , theuns et .",
    "al . 1999 ) .",
    "analytic treatment of the igm beyond the linear regime is exceedingly complicated .",
    "consider a situation in which photo - heating establishes the relation @xmath200 in the igm , where @xmath201 and @xmath6 depend non - trivially on time ( e.g. , theuns et .",
    "al . 1999 ) .",
    "the pressure in this case introduces a length scale @xmath202 ( e.g. , sedov 1959 ) .",
    "if we take constant @xmath201 and @xmath6 , this length scale varies with time like @xmath63 only in the special case of @xmath83 and infinite @xmath110 .",
    "so physically interesting situations including initial pressure in which the collapse is self - similar do not exist .",
    "spherical perturbations with @xmath193 when @xmath3 , and with any @xmath203 when @xmath83 deserve special attention . in the corresponding solutions for shocked collapse without a black hole at the center",

    "according to general relativity this implies the presence of a black hole at the center , invalidating the assumption of no central mass , made in deriving the solutions . in particular , the condition @xmath208 , necessary for shocked collapse , is incompatible with the presence of a central black hole .",
    "near @xmath209 , however , radiation pressure and angular momentum can prevent the formation of a black hole . should this occur , we expect our solution for shocked accretion to be valid away from the central region",

    "so the system retains memory of the initial conditions , even in the highly nonlinear regime . on the other hand ,",
    "a collapsing system of collisionless matter can develop density profiles which do not depend on the initial shape of the perturbation .",
    "for example , according to the solutions of fillmore & goldreich ( 1984 ) , a spherical density perturbation develops into @xmath17 for @xmath11 , and a cylindrical perturbation into @xmath210 for all @xmath110 .",
    "haloes identified in cosmological simulations of collisionless particles with generic initial conditions , also tend to have density profiles independent of the spectrum of the initial fluctuations ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) .",
    "our results are relevant for describing the gas distribution in various physical systems such as the cores of clusters or pancake - like superclusters . over a limited range of scales",
    ", the index @xmath110 can be related to the index , @xmath211 , of the three dimensional power spectrum , @xmath212 , of the linear density fluctuations .",
    "if the initial density field is gaussian with a scale free power spectrum then the properties of the nonlinear field depend only on one scale .",
    "this is the nonlinear scale , @xmath213 , defined as the scale on which the rms value of density fluctuations is unity .",
    "this scale grows with time like does not involve the dimension @xmath214 because @xmath211 refers to the three dimensional @xmath215 so the rms value on a scale @xmath216 is @xmath217 independent of @xmath214 . ] @xmath218 . by matching the time dependence of @xmath213 and @xmath219",
    "we identify @xmath220 .",
    "so the collapse of gas into galaxies and clusters can be , respectively , modeled by our solutions for @xmath221 and @xmath222 , where we have taken @xmath223 and @xmath224 assuming a cold dark matter power spectrum .",
    "taking @xmath225 for collapse on a pancake - like large scale superclusters gives @xmath226 .",
    "another way to relate @xmath110 and @xmath211 is to identify symmetric perturbations with local maxima in the linear density field ( hoffman & shaham 1985 ) .",
    "the shape of high density peaks in a gaussian field varies with @xmath23 like the two - point correlation function , @xmath227 ( e.g. , bardeen et .",
    "al . 1986 ) .",
    "so , at least in the limit of high peaks , @xmath228 . on galaxy and cluster scales the relation @xmath228 , respectively , gives @xmath229 and @xmath230 in contrast to @xmath231 and @xmath222 obtained from @xmath220 .",
    "note however that gas in galaxies tends to settle into disks and so our solutions are less relevant than they are for cluster size objects .",
    "in spherical geometry the asymptotic behaviour shows that the gas can not be pressure supported if @xmath145 , and @xmath11 for collapse with , and without collisionless matter , respectively .",
    "estimates of the masses of rich galaxy clusters from x - ray observations of the intracluster gas rely on hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. , fabian 1994 ) .",
    "if on cluster scales @xmath232@xmath233 , then the asymptotic behaviour implies that the cluster gas may not be in hydrostatic equilibrium . how large is the error introduced in the mass estimates by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ?",
    "the following argument shows that this error is negligible .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium calculations neglect the term @xmath234 in the mass estimate . using",
    "the asymptotic expansion one finds that neglecting this term amounts to a relative mass error of @xmath235 where @xmath169 is the turnaround time of the shell present at @xmath23 at the current time @xmath52 .",
    "shells in the inner regions have passed their maximum expansion a few dynamical times ago .",
    "therefore @xmath236 and since @xmath237 we conclude that the error is negligible .",
    "the solutions are related to modelling the structure of haloes made of self interacting dark matter ( sidm ) ( spergel & steinhardt 1999 ) with large interaction cross section . on scales of massive galaxies and clusters ,",
    "our results predict final density profile @xmath238 to @xmath239 .",
    "these profiles are consistent with the results obtained by moore et .",
    "al . in their simulations of sidm with large cross section .",
