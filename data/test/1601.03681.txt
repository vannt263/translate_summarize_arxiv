    "data from the large area telescope ( lat ) on the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope have shown definitively that millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are gamma - ray emitters similar to young pulsars @xcite , and more than a quarter of all known msps outside of globular clusters were discovered in radio searches targeting _ fermi _ unidentified sources only within the past six years @xcite .",
    "_ fermi _ has been especially successful in uncovering msps in black widow and redback binary systems , where the pulsar s intense particle wind gradually ablates the companion .",
    "the main difference between the two classes is the mass and type of the companion . while in black widow systems the companion is degenerate , with a mass of 0.010.05  _ @xmath0 , redback pulsars have non - degenerate companions whose mass is an order of magnitude larger @xcite .",
    "both types are believed to be transitional between accreting low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , rotation - powered binary msps , and isolated msps .",
    "nineteen of 25 known black widows and nine of 13 known redbacks in the galactic field were discovered in radio searches of _ fermi _ unidentified sources .",
    "black widows and redbacks are relatively rare objects because they are selected against in undirected ( `` all sky '' ) surveys due to their intrinsic properties ( radio eclipses , high line - of - sight acceleration from orbital motion ) and because this stage in msp evolution is short compared to an msp s lifetime .",
    "consequently , there is much still to be learned about the details of the transition between accreting and rotation - powered msps ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is especially true of redback pulsars , as they are the rarer and more recently discovered type .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed multiwavelength study of psr  j1048 + 2339 , a redback radio pulsar found in a _ fermi _ source by @xcite .",
    "the pulsar s prolonged radio eclipses around superior conjunction as well as `` mini - eclipses '' at other orbital phases are reminiscent of the redback class archetype , psr  j1023 + 0038 , whose transition from lmxb to radio msp was observed almost in real time ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , psr  j1048 + 2339 exhibits significant orbital period variations similar to those observed in the redbacks psr  j1023 + 0038 , psr  j2339@xmath30533 @xcite , and the original black widow pulsar b1957 + 20 @xcite .    in section  [ sec_radio ] we present two years of radio timing observations and polarimetry .",
    "in section  [ sec_optical ] we focus on the optical properties of the system , and in section  [ sec_gamma ] we discuss the gamma - ray counterpart .",
    "psr  j1048 + 2339 was discovered in a search at 327 mhz with the arecibo telescope of high - latitude _ fermi _ unidentified sources from a preliminary version of the 3fgl _ fermi _ lat source catalog @xcite .",
    "the source selection criteria were ( 1 ) non - variability in gamma - rays , ( 2 ) pulsar - like gamma - ray spectrum , and ( 3 ) an error box 15  across or smaller , corresponding to the diameter of the arecibo beam at 327  mhz .",
    "the pulsar was discovered in a 15-minute observation targeting the _ fermi _ source 3fgl  j1048.6 + 2338 on 2013 august 4 .",
    "psr j1048 + 2339 has a pulse period of 4.66 ms and a dispersion measure ( dm ) of 16.65  pc  @xmath4 .",
    "according to the ne2001 model of electron density in the galaxy @xcite , this dm corresponds to a distance of 0.7  kpc .",
    "we performed timing observations of psr j1048 + 2339 at 26 epochs between 2013 august 4 and 2015 september 20 using the arecibo radio telescope at 327  mhz .",
    "the observations used the puppi backend in `` fast4k '' mode , with 4096 channels and a 81.92  @xmath5s sampling time .",
    "since the minimum bandwidth provided by puppi , 100  mhz , is larger than the receiver bandwidth of 68  mhz , only 2680 channels were recorded to disk , corresponding to the part of the puppi band covering the receiver bandwidth . after deriving a timing solution in 2015 july , we observed psr  j1048 + 2339 at 1430  mhz at two epochs in coherent folding , full - stokes mode using puppi with a bandwidth of 700  mhz , 448 channels , and a 64  @xmath5s sampling time .",
    "many observations spanned eclipse ingress , egress , or showed significant short - timescale emission variations , especially near ingress ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ingress ] ) .",
    "we did not detect any radio emission in the orbital phase range @xmath6  0.020.49 , corresponding to the main eclipse when the pulsar is near superior conjunction with respect to the companion .",
    "sporadic `` mini - eclipses '' occur frequently at other orbital phases and their duration ranges from tens to hundreds of seconds . at two epochs",
    "we did not detect the pulsar even at orbital phases where it is normally visible , @xmath7  0.60.8 ( mjd 57343 and 57345 ; sessions 36 and 37 in fig .  [ fig_det ] ) , indicating that the pulsed radio emission may be obscured by dense ionized gas for extended periods of time .      in order to derive a phase - connected timing solution that accounts for every rotation of the pulsar between observations , we extracted times - of - arrival ( toas ) from folded 327  mhz data using a pulse profile template consisting of four gaussian components , two each for the main pulse and interpulse .",
    "we used the tempo software package and the btx binary model ( @xcite ; d.  j.  nice , unpublished ) to perform least - squares fitting of various pulsar parameters by minimizing the square of the differences between expected and measured toas , after excluding three points with large , apparently dispersion - induced delays .",
    "we scale the toa uncertainties by a factor of 1.47 in order to bring the reduced @xmath8 of the fit to unity .",
    "the resulting best - fit parameters and other derived pulsar properties are listed in table [ tab_pulsars ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_res ] shows the timing residuals for all 327  mhz observations .",
    "there are no significant trends in the remaining timing residuals , indicating that at the current timing precision and for the current data set , the ephemeris presented in table [ tab_pulsars ] describes the toas .",
    "the most unusual timing property of j1048 + 2339 is its orbital period variation necessitating the fitting of five orbital period derivatives in order to obtain a timing model that fits the data well over the full time span of radio observations ( @xmath9 years ) .",
    "the relatively short span of the solution and the large number of orbital period derivatives required to model the data mean that there are significant correlations between some of the timing parameters ( e.g. the astrometric and orbital parameters ) . as a result ,",
    "the tempo uncertainties of the celestial coordinates are significantly underestimated ( see section  [ sec : energetics ] ) .",
    "two toas near eclipse egress ( orbital phase @xmath10 ) show an extra delay indicating that pulses are passing through the outer layers of the companion .",
    "one toa near orbital phase @xmath11 also shows an extra delay .",
    "such features are common in systems where gas turbulence and outflows may introduce short - lived dispersive delays in the radio emission at various orbital phases .",
    "we note that this feature is present in only one of several observations spanning that part of the orbit .",
    "we calculate that the extra delays observed for these three toas correspond to a dm excess of 0.008 , 0.003 , and 0.005  pc  @xmath4 . assuming that the dm excess is incurred over a linear distance equivalent to the projected semimajor axis of the orbit ( or the radius of the companion , which is of the same order of magnitude )",
    ", we obtain an intra - binary electron density on the order of @xmath12  @xmath4 . in comparison , @xcite find an intra - binary electron density of @xmath13  @xmath4 for the eclipsing msp b1744@xmath324a , and @xcite find a similar value for psr  j2140@xmath32310a .",
    "we performed three observations of psr  j1048 + 2339 using the arecibo l - wide receiver and the puppi backend with a bandwidth of 700  mhz centered on 1430  mhz .",
    "one of the observations was in search mode , for a duration of 15 minutes .",
    "the remaining two observations were in coherent dedispersion full - stokes mode , for 40 minutes each .",
    "the coherently dedispersed l - wide data were analyzed with psrchive @xcite and figure  [ fig_pol ] shows the calibrated full - stokes pulse profile averaged from the two observations .",
    "the brightest component of the main pulse exhibits significant circular polarization , while the interpulse is linearly polarized .",
    "the pulse profile and linear polarization vector position angle are consistent between the two observations .",
    "the calibrated period - averaged flux densities are @xmath14  mjy and @xmath15  mjy , assuming a 20% uncertainty .",
    "the estimated rotation measure is @xmath16  rad  m@xmath17 , consistent with zero .",
    "we computed the flux density from our search - mode observations at other frequencies ( where calibrated flux density measurements were not available ) using the radiometer equation @xcite . at 327  mhz , out of 80 data sets we excluded those spanning ingress , egress , or containing `` mini - eclipses '' and calculated a period - averaged flux density from each of the remaining 47 data sets .",
    "the 327  mhz arecibo receiver has gain @xmath18  k / jy .",
    "nominal receiver temperature is 95  k , including spillover . scaling the 408  mhz sky temperature @xcite to 327  mhz yields @xmath19  k. overall , @xmath20  k.",
    "the range of flux density values we obtain is @xmath21  0.55.3  mjy , with a mean of 1.6  mjy and a standard deviation of 1.1  mjy .",
    "we also analyzed two robert c.  byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) observations at 820 mhz from an earlier search of the _ fermi _ source 3fgl  j1048.6 + 2338 where the pulsar was not detected in a blind periodicity search , but a pulsed signal became evident after the data were folded with our radio ephemeris .",
    "the observations used the guppi backend with a bandwidth of 200  mhz .",
    "the 820  mhz receiver has @xmath22  k / jy and @xmath23  k. the observation times are 10 and 99 minutes , and we obtain period - averaged flux densities of @xmath24 and 0.11  mjy , respectively .    the difference in flux densities between observations at each of the three observing frequencies indicates significant scintillation and/or variability .",
    "because of this , and the fact that we have only two observations at 820  mhz and three at 1430  mhz , we refrain from calculating a spectral index , but it appears compatible with that of a typical pulsar .    figure  [ fig_multifreq ] shows averaged pulse profiles at 327 , 820 , and 1430  mhz aligned in phase using the radio ephemeris .",
    "there is significant profile evolution with frequency : the pulse at phase @xmath25 is brighter at 327  mhz but becomes weaker than the interpulse as the frequency increases . within the interpulse at phase @xmath26 in figure  [ fig_multifreq ] ,",
    "the trailing component is brighter at 327  mhz but the leading component dominates at the higher frequencies .",
    "using the radio timing position , we identified a 20th magnitude candidate optical counterpart to  in the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts , @xcite ) second data release .",
    "the catalina i d number of the star is 1123054021805 .",
    "we extracted 8 years of crts data on this star , consisting of 403 observations on 119 nights from 2005 april  10 to 2013 june  3 ( figure  [ fig : periodogram]a ) . on a typical night , four unfiltered 30  s exposures of a field are taken within 30 minutes , and the photometry is expressed as @xmath27 magnitudes ( discussed in section  [ sec : interpret ] ) . the @xmath28 limiting magnitude is @xmath29 as we infer from those points whose error bars are @xmath30  mag .",
    "we first transformed the times of the data to barycentric dynamical time for consistency with the radio pulsar ephemeris .",
    "magnitudes were converted to fluxes , which were normalized by the variance of the data @xcite , and a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite was calculated around the radio pulsar s orbital period . in this analysis we omitted high points that are clear outliers from the mean light curve , because they add noise at all frequencies .",
    "this was done crudely by excluding the 25 points with @xmath31 .",
    "although some may just be statistical fluctuations , 19 of them can be considered confirmed outliers because there are at least two on the same night .",
    "examples of excluded points are the four brightest in figure  [ fig : periodogram]a , with magnitudes 18.1217.59 on mjd 54536 ( 2008 march 11 ) .",
    "they clearly represent some sort of flare , a non - stationary process .",
    "this simple procedure may cause us to underestimate the normal maximum flux , and it does not account for smaller flares that may occur during fainter phases of the orbit ; i.e. , we do not iterate the selection of outliers based on their phase in the folded light curve .",
    "a strong signal ( figure  [ fig : periodogram]b ) is detected at @xmath32  d , consistent with the more precise orbital period of the radio pulsar , @xmath33  d. the noise power in the periodogram is measured to be exponentially distributed with a mean of 2.06 ( not 1 as expected for white noise , due to the closely correlated times of the nightly points ) , so the peak power of 42.0 has a single - trial chance probability of @xmath34 .    since the optical search found a period consistent with the radio pulsar s orbital period , we folded the data on the precise radio ephemeris .",
    "more precisely , we used the orbital period and time of ascending node , but not the period derivative(s ) , as the latter are known to wander on long timescales in such systems and can become either positive or negative , as seen in @xcite and @xcite . for the purpose of displaying the folded data",
    "( figure  [ fig : fold]a ) , we restored the high points previously omitted as flares in the periodogram analysis .",
    "finally , we calculated a mean light curve by averaging the points ( by flux , but not weighted by error bars ) in 30 bins in orbital phase while excluding the flaring points .",
    "the mean light curve is displayed in the inset of figure  [ fig : fold]a .",
    "we also extracted observations of  from the palomar transient factory ( ptf , @xcite ) .",
    "only nine @xmath35-filter measurements were made over 2012 march 2327 , but they fortuitously cover a large fraction of the orbit , with smaller errors than crts .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fold]b , the shape of the modulation is very much like the mean crts light curve , and has the same total amplitude of @xmath36  mag .      the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) photometric catalog lists the optical counterpart of psr  j1048 + 2339 at position ( j2000.0 ) r.a.@xmath37 , decl.@xmath38 . the observation occurred on 2005 february 4 ( mjd 53405.39 ) at phase 0.96 of the binary orbit .",
    "the sdss psf magnitudes are @xmath39 .",
    "we used the equations of lupton ( 2005 ) to transform these to the johnson system , giving @xmath40 .",
    "this is useful , as the crts unfiltered magnitude @xmath27 is not a good approximation to johnson @xmath41 for red stars . knowing the color , a more precise calibration of crts is given as @xmath42 @xcite . at @xmath43 , @xmath44 from the binned light curve in figure  [ fig : fold]a , therefore @xmath45 , in excellent agreement with @xmath46 from the sdss .",
    "the total range of the light curve , neglecting any color changes , is then @xmath47 . in principle",
    ", one could get some information about the @xmath48 color variation around the orbit by comparing the crts and ptf light curves .",
    "but the sparseness of the ptf data , and the poor sensitivity of the crts data around the minimum of the light curve , do not enable such a variation to be measured robustly .      psr  j1048 +",
    "2339 was also detected by the pan - starrs ps1 survey @xcite .",
    "the pan - starrs survey has been photometrically calibrated using a two - stage approach . in the first stage ,",
    "photometrically stable nights are identified and the system zero points and a modest number of other parameters are determined based on the relative photometry overlaps , resulting in systematic uncertainties of ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) = ( 8.0 , 7.0 , 9.0 , 10.7 , 12.4 ) mmag @xcite . in the second stage , the resulting zero points are used to tie the remainder of the data to this internal system @xcite , with the overall photometric system tied to the ab system via spectrophotometric standards @xcite .",
    "there have been to date three image processing pipeline versions , designated pv1 , pv2 , and pv3 .",
    "pv2 is currently the most reliable astrometrically , but yields fewer total detections than pv3 because it covers fewer epochs .",
    "the shorter wavelengths give smaller uncertainties in position .",
    "using 16 detections in the @xmath49  and @xmath50  filters ( mean epoch mjd 55674 ) and assuming a 50  mas error radius to allow for unknown systematics , we find ( j2000.0 ) r.a.@xmath54 , decl.@xmath55 .",
    "pv3 is preferred for photometry , being better calibrated and more complete .",
    "for psr  j1048 + 2339 , pv3 yields 75 useful detections ( by a point - spread function goodness - of - fit criterion ) , typically obtained on 68 nights per filter , and spanning mjd  @xmath56 ( 2010 february 15  2015 january 21 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_grizy ] shows the light curves of psr  j1048 + 2339 in all five bands , with orbital phase calculated using the same method as for the crts and ptf data ( see section  [ sec : crts ] ) .",
    "phase coverage is non - uniform in all filters .",
    "nevertheless , it is evident that the amplitude of modulation is a decreasing function of wavelength ; @xmath49  and @xmath50  span more than 1.0 mag , while the other bands are less variable .",
    "this is expected for a heating effect , where brighter regions are hotter . in all filters ,",
    "the minimum occurs at @xmath57 and the maximum at @xmath58 . on the @xmath50  filter data in figure  [ fig_grizy",
    "] we superpose the mean unfiltered crts light curve from the inset of figure  [ fig : fold ] , without any renormalization .",
    "these two light curves bear some resemblance , although both @xmath49  and @xmath50  have considerably higher amplitude of modulation than crts . the small number but high accuracy of the pan - starrs points leaves an impression that intrinsic variation may be frequent , while it is smoothed out in the crts mean light curve that comprises a much larger number of less precise measurements .",
    "we performed a spectral analysis of the gamma - ray source 3fgl  j1048.6 + 2338 to characterize its spectrum and perform an optimized pulsation search using the weighted h - test @xcite .",
    "we used a subset of the recently released pass 8 lat data set starting from 2013 august 4 ( the beginning of our phase - connected radio timing solution ) and extending through 2015 july 15 ( met 397267203  458611204 ) .",
    "we selected source class events ( ` evclass = 128 and evtype = 3 ` ) only during the intervals of good science data ( ` data_qual=1 and lat_config=1 ` ) and restricted our events to those with a zenith angle less than 90@xmath59 and energies from 100  mev to 100  gev .",
    "we selected events from a 15@xmath59 radius around the source and performed a binned likelihood analysis over a @xmath60 region with 0.1@xmath59 pixels .",

    "we compute a pulse phase for each selected lat photon using the ` fermi ` plugin for tempo2 @xcite and the best - fit radio timing model .",
    "the resulting weighted h - test value was 18.8 , corresponding to a significance of 3.45@xmath61 , not enough for a high - confidence claim of a pulsed detection .",
    "it is not feasible to extend the span of gamma - ray timing analysis earlier than the start of our radio timing solution due to the significant orbital period variations that are the hallmark of psr  j1048 + 2339 .",
    "however , the h - test value improves as the radio timing solution and correspondingly the gamma - ray timing span are extended forward with the accumulation of more radio observations .",
    "this suggests that a confident detection of gamma - ray pulsations is likely with @xmath71 more years of radio timing data and an improved timing model that includes proper motion and possibly higher - order orbital period derivatives .",

    "assuming @xmath101 , and using the dm distance of 0.7 kpc , the gamma - ray luminosity is @xmath102 erg s@xmath64 .",
    "this yields an efficiency @xmath103 of 2.4% .",
    "this is consistent with , but on the low end of the distribution of , efficiencies observed for lat - detected msps @xcite .",
    "any kinematic corrections to the spin - down will serve to increase the efficiency .",
    "the most consistent feature of the optical light curves is the minimum at @xmath57 .",
    "this accords with the expectation for pulsar wind heating of the companion star , as phase 0.25 corresponds to inferior conjunction of the companion , when we are viewing its cold side .",
    "the consistent alignment also implies that a constant radio period serves well to extrapolate the orbital phase over the previous 9  yr . on the other hand , the light curves do not have the symmetric heating maximum around @xmath104 expected in this scenario .",
    "rather , the flux is higher at @xmath105 and decreases toward @xmath106 .",
    "this resembles a similar sloping feature in the optical and x - ray light curves of the transitioning millisecond pulsar psr j1023 + 0038 when in its radio - pulsar state @xcite .",
    "it could indicate that the heating is asymmetric because it does not come directly from the pulsar , but is mediated by an intrabinary shock that has a skewed shape near the companion .",
    "alternatively , the shape of the light curve may be affected by the magnetic field of the companion directly channeling the pulsar wind to localized regions on its surface @xcite .",
    "spectral hardening around @xmath105 seen in the pan - starrs data is generally consistent with heating due to irradiation from the pulsar .",
    "the amplitude of modulation is about 0.8 magnitudes in @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , but it increases to @xmath107 magnitudes in @xmath49  and @xmath50 . the departure from the expected symmetry around @xmath104 in the pan - starrs data is even more pronounced than in crts , which , because of the smaller number of pan - starrs points , may indicate that stochastic variability is prevalent",
    ". some measurements in the same filter differ by as much as @xmath108  magnitudes at the same orbital phase",
    ".    there may be some significance to the fact that the peak in the apparent heating effect is displaced toward orbital phases earlier than 0.75 in both crts and pan - starss .",
    "an earlier peak implies that the trailing side of the companion , seen while it is moving away from the observer , is hotter than the leading side .",
    "this may indicate where the intrabinary shock is closest to the surface of the companion and illuminating it with the greatest geometrical covering factor .",
    "in his prediction for `` hidden '' millisecond pulsars of type ii , @xcite argued that the wind ablated from the companion would be displaced in the direction of orbital motion ( leading ) due to the coriolis force .",
    "this would force the shock away from the companion in the leading direction , possibly leaving the more efficient heating to the trailing side .",
    "any more detailed interpretation of the optical modulation is hampered by the evident intrinsic variability in the crts and pan - starrs data on timescales that are not yet fully explored . however , it would be interesting with new data to relate well - sampled optical light curves to the orbital phase distribution of the radio eclipses , to see if both can be explained by the geometry of the ablated wind .",
    "in addition to heating , there may be some modulation due to our changing view of the tidally distorted surface of the companion , nearly filling its roche - lobe .",
    "such ellipsoidal modulation produces maxima of equal height at @xmath109 and 0.5 , and unequal minima at @xmath110 and 0.75 , the latter one being lower .",
    "this effect dominates the light curve of the 5  hr period redback psr j1628@xmath33205 @xcite and others , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , the maximum ellipsoidal amplitude is only expected to be @xmath108  mag , while the mean light curve of  varies by @xmath111  mag . also , the two local minima in the mean crts light curve are not separated by 0.5 in phase , but more like 0.6 .",
    "it is possible that ellipsoidal modulation is a small contributor even though it can not explain the gross features of the light curve of .",
    "we would like to know the intrinsic colors of the companion star to estimate its spectral type and radius . while the pan - starrs photometry represents the best broad - band spectral information currently available on this object , its sparse observations , together with the substantial variability of the source , both orbital and random , prevents a reliable color from being obtained from those exposures , which were taken more than 16 minutes apart .",
    "in contrast , the single - epoch sdss photometry was acquired within 5 minutes , which is why we used the magnitudes transformed from the sdss to calibrate the crts light curve approximately ( see section  [ sec : sdss ] ) .",
    "the conclusions that follow from this are tentative , and must be tested with detailed temperature measurements and modeling of the orbital light curve .    assuming that we are viewing the orbit nearly edge - on ( @xmath112 ) , @xmath113 at @xmath110 represents the unheated side of the companion . at the dm distance of @xmath97  kpc ,",
    "the interstellar extinction measured from pan - starrs and 2mass photometry is @xmath114 @xcite , so the extinction - corrected apparent magnitude is @xmath115 and the absolute magnitude is @xmath116 , suggesting a main - sequence star of spectral type m4 , which has a radius of @xmath117 and an effective temperature of @xmath118  k. ( if @xmath119 , the phase of minimum light represents a mixture of spectral types both hotter and cooler than m4 . ) but the sdss colors at @xmath43 , near quadrature , correspond to an earlier spectral type , around k6 .",
    "therefore , we can assume that the heated side of the companion is , on average , hotter than a k6 star , or @xmath120 .",
    "given the pulsar s apparent spin - down luminosity , @xmath121 erg  s@xmath64 corrected for proper motion , we can estimate the efficiency of pulsar heating during the bright phase of the optical light curve . assuming an average @xmath122  k for the heated half of the star",
    ", its extra luminosity at phase 0.75 can be expressed in terms of the heating efficiency @xmath123 of an assumed isotropic pulsar wind as @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the orbital separation .",
    "( other authors use a factor of @xmath126 here instead of our @xmath127 . ) for an assumed ns mass of @xmath128 and an orbital inclination of @xmath112 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , pulsar heating is only marginally able to power the observed peak luminosity , because the needed efficiency @xmath123 is @xmath131 .",
    "there are a number of theoretical reasons that @xmath123 should not exceed 0.5 , as summarized by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite estimated an efficiency in the range @xmath132 for the four systems they modeled , while @xcite found @xmath133 for the black widow psr j1810 + 1744 .",
    "@xcite modeled the redback psr j2215 + 5135 with @xmath134 , and @xcite found @xmath133 for the black widow psr j1311@xmath33430 .",
    "so more complex physical effects are clearly having an important influence .",
    "one way to reduce the inferred efficiency is to assume that the pulsar wind is beamed in the orbital plane in this system , or channeled by the intrinsic magnetic field of the companion .    with an estimated @xmath117 from its optical properties",
    ", the companion appears to significantly underfill its roche lobe , which has radius @xmath135 @xcite for @xmath136 .",
    "this would reduce any ellipsoidal modulation .",
    "if we could double the distance to 1.4  kpc , then the companion could be an m2 star with @xmath137  k and fill its roche lobe .",
    "but the difficulty of pulsar wind heating would not be ameliorated much because @xmath123 would become only slightly smaller , @xmath138 , for the same @xmath139 used above . however , these conclusions are sensitive to the effective @xmath139 and the inclination @xmath140 , both of which remain to be measured .",
    "figure  [ fig_tasc ] illustrates the orbital period variations of psr  j1048 + 2339 .",
    "large orbital period variations are known to occur in other redback systems such as psr  j1023 + 0038 @xcite and j2339@xmath30533 @xcite .",
    "quasi - periodic changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion have been proposed to explain observations showing the orbital period to oscillate @xcite .",
    "several other effects can contribute to orbital period variations : ( 1 ) energy dissipation via gravitational wave emission , ( 2 ) mass loss , and ( 3 ) doppler shifts due to the shklovskii effect @xcite or galactic rotation .",
    "however , they would result in a monotonic change in @xmath141 and therefore can not adequately explain the observed orbital period variations .",
    "@xcite relates oscillations in the gravitational quadrupole moment of a non - degenerate companion star to a cycle of magnetic activity similar to the 11-year solar cycle .",
    "the changing magnetic field generates a variable torque between the convective outer layer and radiative inner layer of the star .",
    "the torque causes angular momentum to be exchanged between the layers in a quasi - periodic manner , causing changes in the differential rotation between the layers and therefore in the shape of the star .",
    "spin - up of the outer layer corresponds to the star becoming more oblate and to an increase in the gravitational quadrupole moment .",
    "since the total angular momentum in the binary system is conserved , this causes a decrease in the orbital period .",
    "@xcite give an overview of the literature and apply the applegate model to the orbital period variations of psr  j2339@xmath30533 .",
    "we note that since this model relies on convective and radiative layers being present and stars with mass @xmath142  _",
    "@xmath0  are fully convective , it implies that the companion of psr  j1048 + 2339 is more massive than the minimum companion mass @xmath143  _ @xmath0and the orbital inclination is @xmath144 .",
    "following the same procedure as @xcite , we obtain a modulation of @xmath141 with a period of @xmath145 years and amplitude @xmath146  s@xmath64 .",
    "using @xmath143  _ @xmath0 , and estimated companion radius @xmath147  _",
    "@xmath148  ( section  [ sec : companion ] ) , we derive the change in the luminosity of the companion that would account for the energy needed for angular momentum transfer , @xmath149  erg  s@xmath64 ( eqn . 13 from @xcite ) . based on the estimated companion effective temperature @xmath150  k  ( section  [ sec : companion ] )",
    ", its total luminosity is @xmath151  erg  s@xmath64 .",
    "since the energy budget for the angular momentum transfer is only @xmath152 of the companion s intrinsic luminosity , the companion has sufficient energy output to generate the orbital period fluctuations even if the orbital inclination ( assumed to be 90^@xmath153 ) is overestimated , or @xmath154 or @xmath155 are underestimated .",
    "the discovery of the redback pulsar j1048 + 2339 in a _ fermi _ unassociated source and the interesting phenomenology in this binary system add a valuable data point for studies of this still not very well understood class of pulsars .",
    "our radio observations show extensive eclipses around superior conjunction as well as sporadic `` mini - eclipses '' at other orbital phases and an occasional long - term absence of pulsed radio emission even near inferior conjunction .",
    "this indicates that the ionized gas environment in the system is very dynamic and changes significantly on time scales of hours to days .",
    "the radio timing solution that best predicts pulse arrival times includes a fixed proper motion from the apop catalog @xcite and five orbital period derivatives . a likely explanation of the rapid orbital period variations is quasi - periodic changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion due to a magnetic torque mechanism similar to that at play in the 11-year solar cycle .",
    "psr  j1048 + 2339 has a 20th magnitude optical counterpart detected by sdss , crts , ptf , and pan - starrs , whose intensity modulation matches the pulsar orbital period .",
    "its magnitude and colors are consistent with those of an m4 main - sequence star on the `` night '' side . while the optical light curve has the expected minimum at @xmath156 , corresponding to inferior conjunction of the companion , it does not exhibit a well - defined maximum at @xmath157 .",
    "this can be explained by heating not directly from the pulsar but from an asymmetric intra - binary shock .",
    "alternatively , the companion magnetic field may be channeling the pulsar wind to specific regions on the companion s surface that get heated preferentially .",
    "we did not find an x - ray counterpart in an existing short _ swift _ observation of the field containing psr  j1048 + 2339 .",
    "the two - year span of the radio ephemeris does not allow a confident detection of gamma - ray pulsations .",
    "due to the rapid orbital period variations , for the gamma - ray timing analysis we can use only _ fermi _ data taken within the radio ephemeris time limits .",
    "however , the h - test value of a potential gamma - ray pulsation detection improves as the span of the radio timing solution grows , indicating that detection of gamma - ray pulsations is likely as we extend and improve the psr  j1048 + 2339 timing solution within the next 12 years .",
