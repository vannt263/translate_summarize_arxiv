    "the study of cold atoms has flourished due to the vast extent of control and tunability available to experimentalists . in the laboratory",
    "it is now possible to create non - equilibrium systems in a controllable manner for any dimension , using optical traps , and for any interaction strength with feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "such experiments have led to the study of quench dynamics and metastable states @xcite , thermalization rates @xcite and the dynamics of solitons @xcite .",
    "these systems offer a rich variety of new physics in relation to their equilibriated counterparts .",
    "one of the major challenges of the field of dynamics is the presence of different energy scales in the problem . far - from - equilibrium physics requires the knowledge of numerous energy scales which can differ appreciable , in direct contrast to thermodynamic physics where only energy scales small compared to the temperature dominate .",
    "these additional energy scales complicate the problems appreciably as the eigenstates of macroscopic systems at these larger scales are extremely complex .    in the field of dynamics ,",
    "an interesting issue is whether and under what conditions there are universal properties at these intermediate energy scales , analogous to the ones seen in thermodynamics .",
    "since the number of dynamical effects in cold atoms is vast , such a classification of dynamics into different universality classes would be an extremely powerful tool .",
    "some efforts in this area have led to universal relations for quench dynamics across quantum critical points @xcite , turbulence , and soliton dynamics in cold atom systems @xcite .",
    "universal or not , one particularly well studied dynamical effect is the scattering properties of cold atoms in confined geometries @xcite .",
    "these scattering experiments provide detailed information about the interaction between individual atoms , and can be used as a starting point for many - body theories .",
    "the scattering properties of cold atoms are generally examined at low energy scales , where the interaction can be parametrized by the d - dimensional effective scattering length @xcite . in the case of harmonically confined geometries , it is possible to integrate out the transverse degrees of freedom and write down an effective low - dimensional model with scattering lengths defined in terms of the harmonic trap length , @xmath5 , and the three dimensional scattering length , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this allows one to tune the low - dimensional interaction strength from zero to infinitely positive or negative values by simply varying the three dimensional scattering length or the length scale of the harmonic confining potential .",
    "this effect is known as confinement induced resonance @xcite , and is a consequence of virtual scattering between different transverse energy levels in harmonically confined geometries .",
    "this phenomenon has been experimentally verified @xcite for both 1d and 2d systems .    in this article",
    "we examine the scattering properties of cold atoms and introduce another important consequence of harmonically confined geometries : the universal properties of scattering dynamics at intermediate energy scales , or energies larger than the trap frequency @xmath7 but much smaller than the effective range of the potential . in general",
    "the scattering dynamics of cold atoms are not universal in the sense that they rely on the specific value of the effective low dimensional interaction . however , whenever the energy of the cold atoms is resonant with that of a transverse energy level , the atoms become non - interacting . in the proximity of such a resonance ,",
    "physical observables take on universal scaling forms depending only upon the energy difference between the atoms and the transverse energy level .",
    "the scaling forms in this limit are independent of the interaction strength and for a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "consider two cold atoms in the presence of a confining potential @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the magnitude of the position vector in the transverse directions , interacting via a separable contact interaction @xmath10 .",
    "such a confinement can be easily produced in the laboratory @xcite and acts to reduce the original three dimensional system to that of a quasi - d dimensional system , where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . in the case of harmonic confinement , the center of mass and relative motions of these two particles can be separated .",
    "the interaction will only affect the relative motion of the particles , and thus the center of mass motion can be ignored .",
    "the hamiltonian for the relative motion is given as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 have been set to unity .",
    "the relative hamiltonian without interactions has a set of eigenstates with continuous quantum numbers @xmath16 for the free @xmath17 dimensions , and a discrete set , @xmath18 , for the transverse energy levels .",
    "the energy for a state @xmath19 is @xmath20 .",
    "the discrete energy levels associated with the transverse motion satisfy the harmonic oscillator schrodinger equation in the transverse dimensions . in this notation ,",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian is a series of bands with quadratic dispersion indexed by @xmath18 .",
    "all the scattering dynamics are contained in the t - matrix which incorporates the effects of the interaction to infinite order .",
    "the t - matrix is defined through the integral equation :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the propagator for the non - interacting hamiltonian .",
    "since the interaction potential is separable , it is possible to solve the scattering problem in its entirety .",
    "the solution is :    @xmath23 .",

    "( [ eq : general_t ] ) , the free dimensions have been integrated out , leaving only the discrete bands associated with the transverse motion .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : general_t ] ) is divergent .",
    "this divergence can be incorporated into a finite renormalized coupling constant @xmath24 .",
    "each band contributes to the renormalization process , and it is possible to study the flow of the coupling constant as these transverse energy levels are removed from the system .    to this end",
    "consider a system initially prepared in the state @xmath25 with energy @xmath26 . instead of a system with an infinite number of bands ,",
    "one considers a system with a finite number of bands with indices @xmath27 and an appropriate renormalized coupling constant :    @xmath28 .",

    "we require that the t - matrix produces the same physics regardless of the number of bands , which implies that the t - matrix is invariant for any value of @xmath30 .",
    "this invariance condition allows us to calculate the change in the coupling constant as @xmath30 is reduced to zero .",
    "the renormalization step is defined by integrating out the bands @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath33 ( if it exists ) by defining a new renormalized coupling constant @xmath34 :    @xmath35    this procedure is performed until the system only contains one band left , the initial one , and is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .    after performing the renormalization step ,",
    "one finds the relation between @xmath29 and @xmath34 :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is :    @xmath38    and @xmath5 is the harmonic length of the trap .",
    "it is then possible to cast this relation into a form that resembles the standard renormalization group formulation @xcite .",
    "one first defines a dimensionless coupling constant ,    @xmath39    with this definition , in direct analogy to the @xmath40-function , we define @xmath41 , the so called @xmath42-function , to describe the flow of @xmath43 :    @xmath44    in contrast to the @xmath40-function , the @xmath42-function depends explicitly on the cut - off @xmath30 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the harmonic trap explicitly breaks the scale invariance of the problem . in spite of this ,",
    "the @xmath42-function still has relevant information on the renormalization process in such a system .",
    "one can show that the only fixed point in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) is the non - interacting fixed point , @xmath45 , opposed to the @xmath40-function which allows a strong coupling fixed point in the infra - red limit in the case of one dimension , the tonks - girardeau gas @xcite .",
    "this non - interacting fixed point can be reached in one of two ways .",
    "the first is the trivial case where the system is initially non - interacting and @xmath46 for all steps .",
    "however , it is possible to reach this fixed point in an atypical manner .    if the initial dimensionless coupling constant is non - zero , it is possible to reach the non - interacting case if @xmath37 is divergent for some step @xmath47 . at this step",
    "the @xmath42-function has the following form @xmath48 , which implies @xmath49 , independent of the actual form of @xmath50 before the step .",
    "this universality of the flow is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) .",
    "the fixed point is thus universal for infinite @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath51 is finite , non - universal corrections that depend on @xmath50 will appear and define the width of the universal regime .",
    "for the specific case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) , @xmath51 diverges whenever the energy is commensurate with @xmath52 as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this creates a sequence of non - interacting universal fixed points separated by the band gap in energy space as demonstrated fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "for large but finite @xmath51 , the dimensionless coupling constant will have the universal scaling form :    @xmath56    corrections to this universal behaviour will appear at order @xmath57 and are depicted in fig  [ fig2 ] ( d ) . in the limit @xmath58 , or in two dimensions , @xmath51 diverges logarithmically and hence the dimensionless coupling constant will also scale logarithmically , @xmath59 , with corrections of order @xmath60",
    ".    however , if the kinetic energy of the system is much less than the band gap , the initial band and @xmath61 will coincide .",
    "thus the interaction will renormalize to a finite value as the initial band is not included in the renormalization procedure .",
    "the system then behaves as a true low dimensional system which , for one dimensional gases , implies the system will form a tonks - girardeau gas , whereas in two dimensions , the gas will instead evolve towards the non - interacting gas .",
    "this unique structure of the @xmath42-funciton has immediate implications on the scattering observables of quasi - low dimensional gases .",
    "this can be deduced by examining the fraction of particles scattered out of an initial state , i.e. a generalized reflection coefficient .",
    "near these non - interacting fixed points we can calculate the reflection coefficient perturbatively by normalizing the transition rate from fermi s golden rule @xcite with respect to the initial particle flux . the matrix element",
