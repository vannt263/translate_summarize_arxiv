    "zinc oxide ( zno ) is a ii - vi semiconductor highly transparent ( 85 - 95% ) in the visible region with a wide and direct band - gap of about 3.3ev at room temperature and a high exciton binding energy of 60 mev@xcite .",
    "this semiconductor is very attractive because it has many applications such as transparent conductive contacts , solar cells , laser diodes , ultraviolet lasers , thin films transistors and others@xcite .",
    "zno  is an oxide that can be grown , as a thin film , by many deposition techniques including chemical vapor deposition , radio frequency sputtering , magnetron sputtering , sol - gel , ion - beam assisted , molecular beam epitaxy and pulsed laser deposition@xcite .",
    "the zinc oxide shows a @xmath2-type conduction , without intentional doping , and crystallizes in a wurtzite structure that contains large voids that can easily accommodate interstitial atoms .",
    "the intrinsic point defects i.e. zinc interstitials have been proposed to be the donors causing @xmath2-type conduction@xcite . however , in order to control the doping content , it is necessary to remove oxygen vacancies ( since the lack of oxygen and an excess of zinc leads to a @xmath3-type semiconductor ) .",
    "for this reason , the pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) technique is interesting because it gives the advantage of carrying out the growth in a high - oxygen partial pressure ( typically around 0.2 torr)@xcite .",
    "usually , the films are obtained from a zno target@xcite but we have recently developed a variant technique in which the oxide films are grown from a metal target@xcite .",
    "we have also used this technique to synthesis zno  films described in this article .",
    "fabricating high quality epitaxial thin films with a perfect @xmath4-axis texture , a low density of defects ( i.e. low strained films ) and an extremely smooth surfaces , are important for many applications .  thus , it is necessary to understand the growth mechanisms of zno films that influence the structural and the optical properties . here",
    ", we report the growth of zno films on sapphire ( 0001)-oriented by pld , using a zn metal target .",
    "a number of issues on how to control the growth conditions in order to get good - quality zno films are addressed in this paper . in particular , the effects of the deposition parameters on the degree of epitaxy and defects density of laser - ablated zno films , using a zn metal target , are qualitatively discussed .",
    "the zno films were grown utilizing the pulsed laser deposition technique ( lambda physik , krf laser @xmath5=248 nm ) @xcite by firing a zinc metal target ( 99.995% ) as purchased ( neyco , france ) and without further preparations .",
    "the films are deposited on ( 0001 ) al@xmath0o@xmath1 substrates at a constant temperature under a flux of pure oxygen .",
    "these two parameters ( temperature and oxygen pressure ) were systematically varied .",
    "the substrate temperature ranged from 400 to 750@xmath6 and the pressure was changed from 0.03 to 0.2 torr of o@xmath0 .",
    "thus , different series of films are obtained . at the end of the deposition , the films",
    "were slowly cooled to room temperature ( 20@xmath7 ) under 225 torr of oxygen .",
    "the structural study was done by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using a seifert xrd 3000p for the @xmath8 scans and the @xmath9-scan ( tilting ) .",
    "an xpert phillips was also employed for the in - plane measurements ( @xmath10-scans ) .",
    "both diffractometers utilized the cu , k@xmath11 radiation ( @xmath12 ) . in order to obtain additional information on the structural properties of the zno films ,",
    "we have determined the thin film strains .",
    "this technique used the distance between the atomic planes of a crystalline specimen as an internal strain gage@xcite .",
    "the plane spacing @xmath13 is normal to the diffraction vector @xmath14 .",
    "one can define a strain @xmath15 , along this diffraction vector @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the unstressed plane spacing of the ( @xmath19 ) planes ( i.e. the value of the bulk ) . to measure the stress",
    ", we used the sin@xmath20 technique @xcite .",
    "briefly , in this model , the strain is defined as follows : @xmath21+@xmath22 ( where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constants that depend on the strain along the surface direction , the young s modulus , poisson s ratio and the stress along the direction , for details see ref.15 ) .",
    "additional informations are given from the xrd measurements by calculating the grain size of the crystallites along the @xmath4-axis using the scherrer s formula@xcite :    @xmath25   ( 1 )    where @xmath5 is the x - ray wavelength , @xmath26 is the ( 0002 ) peak width ( in radian ) , @xmath27 the crystal size and @xmath28 the bragg diffraction angle .",
    "rutherford back scattering spectroscopy ( rbs)/ion channeling using a well - collimated 1.5 - 3 mev he@xmath29 ions has been used to determine the epitaxy quality and the film thickness .",
    "surface morphology and roughness measurements were determined by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) in tapping mode using a multimode nanoscope iii ( digitals instruments ) .",
    "optical measurements were investigated with an uv - visible spectrophotometer ( cary 100 scan ) to determine the energy band gap of the different films . in this method , the fundamental absorption , which corresponds to electron excitation from the valence band to conduction band ,",
    "is used to determine the value of the optical band gap through the following relation :    @xmath30  ( 2 )    where @xmath31 is the absorption coefficient , @xmath32 is a constant , @xmath33 is the incident photon energy and @xmath34 the band gap .",
    "a series of films grown in 0.1 torr of o@xmath0 were investigated .",
    "the resulting xrd patterns of zno exhibit two diffraction peaks observed around 2@xmath35 close to 34.48@xmath36 and 72.66@xmath36 .",
    "they are characteristic of the hexagonal zno wurtzite , the @xmath4-axis being perpendicular to the substrate plane@xcite .",
    "the out - of - plane lattice parameter is calculated to be close to 5.205 a  which corresponds to the theoretical bulk value@xcite .",
    "moreover , the out - of - plane lattice parameter is almost constant , equal to 5.198@xmath370.004 a  in the temperature range 500 - 700@xmath6 , which is slightly shorten , as compared to the bulk , but in agreement with a tensile stress within the plane ( see below in the text ) . below 500@xmath6 and above 700@xmath6 , the out - of - plane lattice parameter is much lower ( 5.185 a ) . nevertheless , the full - with - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the rocking - curve @xmath9-scan measured around the 0002 reflection ( tilting ) is decreasing from 1.8@xmath38 at 400@xmath36c to 0.3@xmath36 at 600@xmath39 .",
    "it remains constant from 600@xmath6 to 750@xmath6 ( see fig.1 ) the in - plane epitaxy was investigated by measuring the @xmath10-scan ( recorded around the 2@xmath40 reflection ) at different deposition temperatures .",
    "the resulting plot is given in fig.3 .  while the films grown above 600@xmath6 exhibit 6 diffraction peaks separated of 60@xmath36 in agreement of the six - fold symmetry of the hexagonal lattice of the zno , the films deposited below display 12 diffraction peaks separated of 30@xmath36 . in fact",
    ", these 12 peaks correspond most probably to two different series of 6 peaks i.e. two series of crystallites ( or oriented domains ) that are epitaxially different .",
    "the fwhm of the @xmath10-scan ( twisting ) is also indicated on the left part of fig.3 .",
    "it confirms the degradation of the epitaxy as the deposition temperature is decreasing ( see also fig.1 ) .    in order to evaluate the stress of the zno films , we have used the sin@xmath41 model@xcite that allows to determine the residual stress in epitaxial plane . the stress ( determined as the slope of the curve when plotting the strain @xmath15 vs. sin@xmath42 ) is decreasing when increasing the substrate temperature .",
    "the residual stress is calculated to be 107 mpa at 600@xmath6 and 100.5 mpa at 700@xmath36c .",
    "note that the decrease of the residual stress when increasing the deposition temperature is in a perfect agreement with the decrease of the fwhm of both the ( 0002 ) and the ( 2@xmath40 ) reflections ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "in addition , this value is much lower than previously reported ones ( 330 - 500 mpa)@xcite but these films were grown from a zno  target and the deposition performed at 550@xmath6 under 3.75@xmath4310@xmath44 torr .",
    "the absorbance measurements investigated between 200 and 900 nm show that the films are highly transparent in the visible region and present a steep fall off around 380 nm .",
    "this fundamental absorption can be used to determine the value of the optical band gap .",
    "its dependence on the deposition temperature , is given in fig .",
    "the band gap energy is increasing with the temperature as a result of an increase of the number of defects @xcite .",
    "however , between 550 - 700@xmath6 , the energy gap is almost constant and close to @xmath45 ev , a characteristic of high quality zno films .",
    "the grain size has also been calculated using the sherrer s formula .",
    "the grain size increases with the temperature in the range of 600@xmath46 - 700 @xmath47 up to 25 nm ( see fig.2 ) . as a result ,",
    "when the grain size is increasing , the epitaxy of the films is improving and the energy band gap is increasing to a constant value .",
    "these experiments suggest that at a pressure of 0.1 torr of o@xmath0 , the deposition temperature should be around 600@xmath6 .",
    "thus , in a second step , we have investigated the influence of the oxygen pressure for a fixed temperature of 600@xmath6 .      basically , the xrd of the films ( @xmath8 ) , grown at various oxygen pressure , resemble the previous one .",
    "two diffraction peaks corresponding to @xmath48 and the @xmath49 reflections are predominant and indicate that the film has a @xmath4-axis orientation with an out - of - plane lattice parameter around 5.2 a. in fig.2b , the grain size and the band gap exhibits a maximum indicating an optimum value of the oxygen pressure close to 0.1 torr@xcite . in the same way , the fwhm  of rocking curve ( tilting ) presents a minimum ( 0.3@xmath36 ) for a pressure of 0.1 torr ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "similar behavior is observed when plotting the fwhm  of the @xmath50-scan ( twisting ) : the minimum value ( 0.9@xmath36 ) is also seen at a pressure close to 0.1 torr of o@xmath0 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "such values are comparable to the results of other groups which used ceramic targets@xcite . these results also confirm that a pressure of 0.1 torr will give the better epitaxy ( as seen from @xmath10-scan ) , better texture ( see the values of the fwhm ) and larger nano - crystallites ( 30 nm using sherrer s formula ) of the zno films . the low value obtained at 0.2 torr for the twisting angle",
    "will be explained latter .",
    "we have also noted that the measured value of the out - of plane lattice parameter is 5.1982 a , which is lower than the bulk value ( 5.2066 a@xcite ) .",
    "this indicates a compression ( @xmath510.1% ) of the out - of - plane parameter and an expansion of the in - plane lattice parameter ( 3.253 a  in the film to be compared with 3.2498 a in bulk@xcite ) as observed for many oxide films@xcite .",
    "the tensile stress within the plane of the substrate is confirming by the positive slope of the curve ( strain @xmath15 versus sin@xmath52@xmath53 ) .",
    "the resulting data are given in table 1 for a series of films . at 0.1 torr , the residual stress is minimum ( 107 mpa ) as compared to the films grown at 0.2 torr ( 334 mpa ) or 0.03 torr ( 232 mpa ) .",
    "in addition , the film prepared at 0.1 torr approached the @xmath4-axis value of the bulk@xcite in agreement with a low residual compressive stress .",
    "this is also in perfect accordance with the evolution of the fwhm along both @xmath9 ( tilting ) and @xmath53 ( twisting ) scans ( fig.1 ) where the minimum values are obtained for a pressure of 0.1 torr .",
    "the structural analysis was completed using the measurements of ion channeling using rbs and the results spectra ( random and aligned ) recorded for three different oxygen pressures are given in fig.4 .",
    "the @xmath54 value , which indicates the quality of the film is given a minimum at 0.1 torr ( aligned yield of 8.7% ) as compared to the film grown at 0.03 torr ( aligned yield : 24% ) .",
    "surprisingly the film grown at 0.2 torr is not epitaxied ( no alignment ) .",
    "the low experimental @xmath54 value indicates a very low level of structural defects in this film . on the contrary",
    ", a high @xmath54 value is correlated to a presence of large amount of defects in the crystallites .",
    "the presence of defects leads to a broadening of the diffraction peaks as observed in the plot of the fwhmvs .",
    "oxygen pressure ( fig.3 ) .",
    "note also , that the thickness of the film was also determined with the simulation of the structure and we found that it is increasing with the increase of the oxygen pressure .",
    "the morphology and the surface roughness , determined by afm  measurements , are represented in fig.5 .",
    "the roughness seems to decrease with the increase of oxygen concentration and in the same time , the grains size on the surface is changing .",
    "for the film grown at low pressure ( 0.07  torr ) , the grains size is around 250 nm and seems relatively constant .",
    "furthermore the roughness of this film is about 50 nm . on the contrary ,",
    "the film grown at higher pressure ( 0.1 torr ) shows two types of grains with two different sizes : higher 500 nm and smaller 160 nm than for the film at low pressure .",
    "the roughness is around 50 nm .",
    "finally for the film grown at 0.2 torr , the grains size is larger and seems inhomogeneous , but the roughness ( rms ) being of only 23 nm .    these studies were followed by the determination of the energy band gap , plotted in fig.2b versus the pressure of oxygen .",
    "the film deposited under 0.1 torr presents the widest energy band gap with the value of 3.20 ev .",
    "furthermore the comparison of the gap with the grain size shows the same tendency than with the temperature : when the grains size is larger , the energy band gap between the conduction band and valence band is increased .",
    "these experiments performed on a series of zno  thin films clearly show that there is a correlation between the deposition parameters ( substrate temperature , oxygen pressure ) and many structural parameters including crystallinity , grain size , epitaxy in - the - plane of the substrate , texture along the out - of - plane direction , residual stress , roughness and defects . as observed from the experiments , the best compromise for formation of zno films",
    "is obtained with a deposition temperature of 600 @xmath6 and an oxygen pressure of 0.1 torr . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the effects of the pressure and the temperature upon the formation of zno . to understand the influence of these parameters ,",
    "two conditions must be taken into account : the dynamics of the ablation materials and the nucleation@xcite .    at the beginning , the zinc target ,",
    "is in the metal state and the vapor species ablated out are constituted by zinc element only . the zno formation is due to the reaction with the ambient gas of the chamber .",
    "the collisions between the ejected species and the oxygen increases with the oxygen pressure . on one hand , if the pressure of oxygen is low , the ion fraction and the kinetic energy of the evaporated target material are not really reduced .",
    "furthermore the oxidation could not be completed , allowing some defects in the film and some interstitial zinc .",
    "this number of defects is confirmed with the ( 2@xmath553 ) @xmath10-scan of the film grown at 0.03 torr which shows 12 peaks separated by 30@xmath36 and confirms the low epitaxial quality .",
    "on the other hand , if the quantity of oxygen is too high , the vapor species can undergo enough collisions that nucleation and growth of these vapor species form particulates before their arrival at the substrate . in order to understand the number of collisions ,",
    "the mean free path is approximately 5 cm for a pressure of 10@xmath56 torr and 0.05 cm at a higher pressure of 0.1 torr .",
    "thus , a high ambient pressure increases the size of ultrafine particulates ( which are deposited in the film ) and the thickness layer , and creates a large number of defect .",
    "furthermore , the nucleation process depends on the interfacial energies between the three existing phases : substrate , the condensing material and the vapor .",
    "the minimum - energy shape of a nucleus is like a cap .",
    "the critical size of the nucleus depending on the driving force , @xmath57 , the substrate temperature ( fixed : first part of the study ) and the deposition rate .",
    "a characteristic of small supersaturation ( 0.03 torr ) for large nuclei is the creation of isolated patches ( islands ) of the film onto the substrate which subsequently grow and coalesce together . as the supersaturation increases",
    ", the critical nucleus shrinks until its height reaches on atomic diameter , resulting in a two - dimensional layer ( 0.1 torr ) . for large supersaturation ,",
    "the pld process would cause rapid nucleation of very small clusters .",
    "this is confirmed with the calculation of grain size ( see fig.2b ) which indicates small crystallites : 18 nm and 20.5 nm along the @xmath4-axis for the films grown at 0.03 torr and 0.2 torr , respectively , compared with the films grown at 0.07 torr and 0.1 torr ( around 30 nm ) .",
    "furthermore , the crystalline film growth depends on the surface mobility of the adatom ( vapor atoms ) .",
    "normally , the adatoms will diffuse through several atomic distances before sticking to a stable position within the newly formed film .",
    "the surface temperature of the substrate determines the adatom s surface diffusion ability and a full oxidation of the zinc atom .",
    "the high temperature ( see first part ) favors rapid and defect - free crystal growth ; whereas , low temperature ( between 400 and 450 @xmath36c ) or large supersaturation crystal growth may be overwhelmed by energetic particle impingement , resulting in disordered or even poor crystallized structures .    finally , the dependance of the number of defects from the gap calculation can be observed with optical measurements .",
    "the two films deposited at 0.2 torr ( no epitaxy ) and 0.03 torr ( oriented domains ) show very low energy band gaps .",
    "thus , optical results follow the same trend as the structural analysis .",
    "high quality zno thin films were grown using the pulsed laser deposition technique on ( 0001 ) al@xmath0o@xmath1 substrates starting from a zn metal target .",
    "the growth was performed under high oxygen pressure ( 0.03-.2 torr ) in the temperature range 400 - 750@xmath6 .",
    "we have studied the influence of the growth conditions ( deposition temperature , oxygen pressure ) upon the structural properties that are directly related to the nature of a thin films : out - of - plane alignments , in - plane epitaxy , grain size , distribution of the stress in the different directions etc ...    we concluded that the optimum deposition conditions leading to high quality zno  thin films with good optical properties when using a zn metal target are 600@xmath6 and 0.1 torr of o@xmath0 .",
    "this new alternative method of using a zn metal target , as compared to ceramic target , allows a better control of the zinc oxidation and lead to good structural properties that can be used to many interesting oxides such as vo@xmath0 , wo@xmath1 or tio@xmath0 .",
