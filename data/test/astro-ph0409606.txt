    "the primordial scenario of globular cluster ( gc ) formation was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "their paper considers gcs forming in the early universe out of primordial gas fluctuations on a jeans mass scale .",
    "realization that the dominant mass component of the universe is dark matter ( dm ) led to the revision of this idea in @xcite , where gcs are proposed to have formed in the potential wells of dm minihalos in the early universe . in this revised picture gcs can be considered as some of the earliest galaxies in the universe , with a baryons dominated core and extended dm halo .",
    "this picture of dm - dominated gcs forming in the early universe was later considered by many authors , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "primordial gcs could have formed somewhere between a redshift of @xmath1 , when the first stars in the universe are believed to have been born inside minihalos with total masses @xmath2  @xmath3 @xcite , and redshift of @xmath4 , when the reionization of the universe was complete @xcite .",
    "it is often assumed that the very first stellar objects produced enough lyman - werner photons ( capable of dissolving h@xmath5 molecules , which are the main coolant in the pristine gas ) to prohibit star formation in most of the low mass ( @xmath6  @xmath3 ) gas - rich halos .",
    "cosmological simulations with radiative transfer of @xcite suggest another possibility : in their model , numerous mini - galaxies with masses of @xmath7  @xmath3 form inside relic cosmological h  ii regions .",
    "the observed positive feedback can be explained by high non - equilibrium fraction of free electrons in defunct h  ii regions , which leads to enhanced h@xmath5 production and hence star formation .",
    "this is an interesting mechanism for forming gcs , as it naturally explains the observed higher specific frequency of gcs in higher density regions of the universe ( such as around cd galaxies at the center of clusters of galaxies ) , where large cosmological h  ii regions should have formed in the early universe .    in a widely accepted hierarchical paradigm of structure formation in the universe , small bound objects form first , later merging to form objects of increasingly larger size . in this picture ,",
    "primordial gcs would first experience a major merger with comparable mass halos , or be accreted by a larger halo of a dwarf galaxy size . in their simulations of the formation of a dwarf galaxy in the early universe ( at @xmath8 )",
    ", @xcite observed a formation of gc - type baryonic objects inside dm minihalos , which later merged to form a dwarf galaxy . by the end of the simulations ,",
    "baryonic cores , believed to represent proto - gcs , had apparently lost their individual dm halos .",
    "@xcite suggested that dm was lost because of the violent relaxation accompanying the major merger .",
    "the lack of resolution did not allow the authors to reach more definitive conclusion as to the fate of dm in their proto - gcs .    in the next step",
    ", dwarf galaxies containing primordial gcs would merge to produce objects of increasingly larger size .",
    "this process should continue at the present time .",
    "a well - known example is that of sagittarius dwarf galaxy , which is presently in the process of being disrupted by the tidal forces of milky way and depositing its system of gcs into the halo of our galaxy @xcite .    in the primordial picture of gc formation",
    ", gcs can be considered as small nucleated dwarfs accreted at some point by larger galaxies , which lose their extra - nuclear material ( baryons and dm ) due to stripping by the tidal forces of the accreting galaxy .",
    "such mechanism was invoked to explain the formation of a few of the largest gcs : m51 @xcite , @xmath9 centauri @xcite , and g1 @xcite , which is the satellite of the m31 galaxy . in the quoted papers ,",
    "these gcs are considered to be exceptions .",
    "we suggest instead that this method of forming these gcs is a rule rather than exception , and is fully consistent with primordial gc formation scenarios . in this picture , the above largest gcs are examples of the most recent gc - producing accretion events , and represent a small fraction of the total number of proto - gcs accreted directly by a large galaxy ( milky way or m31 ) in the modern universe ( thus skipping the intermediate step of being accreted by a larger dwarf galaxy in the early universe ) .",
    "@xcite used numerical simulations of a dm - dominated gc orbiting inside the static potential of milky way halo and observations of tidal tails of m2 of @xcite to claim that primordial scenarios of gc formation are inconsistent with observations of galactic gcs . as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , the model of @xcite was too simplistic to address this issue .",
    "most importantly , the author considered all galactic gcs being directly accreted by the milky way , which is definitely not the case in the hierarchical picture of structure formation in the universe . moreover , the dm subhalo model of @xcite is a lowered isothermal sphere with arbitrary ( not cosmologically normalized ) structural parameters , which makes it very different from the dm halos expected to host a gc in the early universe .",
    "one also has to be careful with claims on the existence of `` extratidal features '' around galactic satellites , which includes both gcs and dwarf spheroidal galaxies . in the case of @xmath9",
    "centauri , @xcite showed that the apparent `` tidal tails '' observed by @xcite around this gc are most probably caused by spatially variable foreground dust extinction in its outskirts . in the case of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy ,",
    "the detection of apparent `` extratidal features '' around this galaxy by @xcite was later refuted by observations of @xcite which had much higher sensitivity .",
    "the `` extratidal '' extension of the radial surface brightness profiles of galactic gcs beyond a `` tidal '' king radius is almost always seen at the levels lower than the inferred background contamination level , and could be an artifact of the background correction procedure .",
    "one beautiful example of a gc with obvious tidal tails is that of palomar  5 @xcite . as we will show in this paper ,",
    "a presence of tidal tails in some gcs is not inconsistent with these gcs having formed with dm halos in the early universe , and hence with primordial scenarios of gc formation .    in this series of two papers , we are using high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations of gcs with dm halos to test primordial scenarios of gc formation .",
    "in particular , we are trying to answer the following questions : 1 ) are there obvious signatures of dm presence in gcs ?",
    "2 ) will dm in a primordial gc survive hierarchical process of assembling galaxies in the early universe ?",
    "in the first paper , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper  i ) , we considered the initial relaxation of a stellar cluster at the center of a dm minihalo in the early universe ( around @xmath10 ) . the structural parameters of dm halos were fixed by results of cosmological @xmath11cdm simulations .",
    "the initial non - equilibrium configuration of stellar clusters was that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ms04 ) , where we showed that purely stellar ( no dm ) homogeneous isothermal spheres with the universal values of the initial density @xmath12  @xmath3  pc@xmath13 and velocity dispersion @xmath14  km  s@xmath15 collapse to form gc - like clusters , with all bivariate correlations between structural and dynamic parameters of galactic gcs being accurately reproduced .",
    "we showed in paper  i that many observational features of galactic gcs , used traditionally to argue that these systems are tidally limited purely stellar clusters without dm , can be produced by the presence of significant amounts of dm in their outskirts . in particular , in warm collapse models ( with the initial virial parameter for the stellar core of @xmath16 ) we observed the formation of an apparent `` tidal '' cutoff in surface brightness profiles , with no unusual features in the outer parts of the velocity dispersion profile . in cold collapse models",
    "( with @xmath17 ) , on the contrary , an apparent `` break '' in the outer parts of both surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles is seen , which can be mistakingly interpreted as presence of `` extratidal '' stars heated by the tidal field of the host galaxy .",
    "the results of paper  i are directly applicable to dynamically young intergalactic gcs and gcs which have not experienced significant tidal stripping in the potential of the host galaxies . in this second paper , we test the regime of severe tidal stripping of our primordial dm - dominated gcs in the potential of the host dwarf galaxy . as we discussed above ,",
    "being accreted by a dwarf galaxy would be a typical fate of primordial gcs formed at high redshift .",
    "we use warm collapse models of primordial gcs from paper  i to set up the initial conditions for the present paper .",
    "we consider both simulations suggested ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) and observationally motivated @xcite density profiles for our dm halos .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we describe our models . in section  [ results ]",
    "we discuss the results of the simulations .",
    "we conclude with section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in our model , we explore the impact of tidal fields on dm - dominated gcs orbiting inside a static potential of host dwarf galaxy with a virial mass of @xmath18  @xmath3 .",
    "gcs are assumed to be accreted by the dwarf galaxy at a redshift of @xmath19 .",
    "structural parameters ( virial radius @xmath20 , scale radius @xmath21 , and concentration @xmath22 ) of the host galaxy are fixed by the results of cosmological @xmath11cdm simulations , and at @xmath19 are equal to @xmath23  kpc , @xmath24  kpc , and @xmath25 ( see eqs .",
    "[ 1 - 9 ] from paper  i ) . throughout this paper",
    "we assume the following values of the cosmological parameters : @xmath26 and @xmath27  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "galaxies with @xmath28  @xmath3 correspond to @xmath29 density fluctuations collapsing at @xmath19 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "6 ) and hence are very common at that redshift .",
    "the initial parameters of our gcs are identical to those of our warm collapse models from paper  i. we could not use the cold collapse model of paper  i because it would be an impossible task with the present day technology with the method we are using ( @xmath0-body simulations ) . indeed , all the models presented in the present paper for the warm collapse only case required 3.6 cpu - years to run . the cold collapse models from paper  i ( models c@xmath30 ) took @xmath31 times longer to run than the warm collapse ones ( models w@xmath30 ) for the same evolution time , which is mainly due to @xmath4 times shorter stellar crossing time in the cold models .",
    "in addition , to run the cold collapse models of paper  i for the much longer evolution time of the present paper ( 3  gyr ) , we would have to increase significantly the accuracy of the integration , and increase the number of dm particles by a factor of 20 ( up to @xmath32 particles ) to avoid artificial mass segregation effects which should be very significant for such long evolution time . as a result ,",
    "the time required to simulate the cold collapse models for 3  gyr would be two or more orders of magnitude longer than for the warm collapse case , or a few hundred cpu - years , which is obviously not feasible .",
    "the reasons for choosing the warm versus hot collapse model are that the warm one corresponds to a more typical gc ( with the mass of @xmath33  m@xmath34 for the warm model versus @xmath35  m@xmath34 for the hot one ) , and that the warm model of paper  i exhibits interesting tidal - like features in the outskirts of the cluster ( namely , a cutoff in the surface brightness profile ) caused by the presence of dm halo , whereas the hot collapse model does not have any such features .    an isothermal homogeneous stellar sphere with the universal values of the initial stellar density and velocity dispersion , @xmath36  @xmath3  pc@xmath13 and @xmath14  km  s@xmath15 ( ms04 ) , is set at the center of a dm halo with either nfw or burkert density profiles .",
    "the virial mass of the dm halo is @xmath37  @xmath3 .",
    "the stellar mass is @xmath38  @xmath3 , so the baryonic - to - dm mass ratio is @xmath39 .",
    "our fiducial value of @xmath40 , on one hand , is larger than the fraction of baryons in gcs of @xmath41 @xcite , and on the other hand , is smaller than the universal baryonic - to - dm density ratio of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we assumed gcs have formed at @xmath10 , so the structural parameters of their dm halos are @xmath43  pc , @xmath44  pc , and @xmath45 ( from eqs .",
    "[ 1 - 9 ] of paper  i ) .",
    "the initial virial ratio for our stellar clusters is @xmath46 .",
    "the initial stellar radius is 11.2  pc .",
    "as we showed in paper  i , in the absence of dm our stellar cluster will first collapse ( with the smallest value of the half - mass radius of @xmath47  pc ) , and then bounce to form a relaxed cluster with a flat core , with the radius of @xmath48  pc , and a steep power - law outer density profile .",
    "the crossing time at the half - mass radius of the relaxed cluster is @xmath49  myr .",
    "the crossing times at the half - mass radius for our dm halos are 52 and 61  myr for nfw and burkert profiles , respectively .    for consistency ,",
    "gcs with nfw halos are assumed to orbit a host galaxy with nfw profile , and gcs with burkert halos orbit a burkert host galaxy . in all models ,",
    "the pericentric distance is @xmath50  kpc , and the apocentric distance is @xmath51  kpc .",
    "we chose such a small value of @xmath52 to explore a regime of strong tidal stripping , potentially approaching a violent relaxation mode of dm stripping in the gc formation simulations of @xcite .",
    "our apocentric - to - pericentric distance ratio @xmath53 is similar to orbits of substructure in cosmological @xmath11cdm simulations .",
    "the theoretical radial orbital period is @xmath54  myr for the host galaxy with nfw profile , and @xmath55  myr for the burkert case . in our simulations , subhalos experience dynamic friction caused by the motion of the remnant in the halo of tidally stripped dm particles",
    "this effect is the most noticeable during first 12 orbits ( for the following orbits the mass of the subhalo becomes too small to be affected by the dynamic friction ) , and leads to slightly smaller values of @xmath52 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",

    "as time goes on , the slope of the outer density profile becomes more shallow for both purely stellar and hybrid gcs , but the relative change of the slope caused by the presence of dm stays approximately the same .",
    "also , the radius where the two profiles start diverging , stays approximately the same ( @xmath148  pc ) for the nfw profile , and gradually increases ( from @xmath149 to @xmath150  pc ) for the burkert profile . for both types of dm halos ,",
    "this radius is very close to the radius @xmath107 where the inclosed masses of stars and dm become equal ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the reason for the persistence of the density cutoff in the course of the secular evolution of our cluster is the same as for the appearance of the cutoff at the end of the initial violent relaxation phase ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the original cutoff is caused by the fact that at large radii ( @xmath151 ) the potential of the hybrid gc is dominated by dm . as a result ,",
    "a smaller fraction of stars , ejected from the cluster during the violent relaxation , can populate outer halo , creating a density cutoff at @xmath152 .",
    "similarly , during long - term dynamic evolution of the cluster , caused by encounters between individual stars , stars are being ejected from the core ( core evaporation ) , with very few of them populating the halo beyond @xmath107 because of the potential being dominated by dm at such large radii .",
    "we use isolated dm - only models d@xmath30 to see how numerical artifacts affect the dm density distribution in our simulations .",
    "@xcite discussed the impact of discreteness effects of @xmath0-body simulations on radial density profiles of isotropic nfw halos .",
    "according to these authors , for the first @xmath153 crossing times at the virial radius , the density at the center of the halo is decreasing due to heating by faster moving particles , causing the core to expand . at the end of this phase ,",
    "the central velocity dispersion becomes comparable to the velocity dispersion at the scale radius @xmath154 .",
    "( in nfw models the velocity dispersion is highest around @xmath154 , and becomes smaller for both smaller and larger radii . )    we see a similar trend in our nfw model , d@xmath69 . in our case , the total evolution time is @xmath155 crossing times at the virial radius @xmath156  myr , so at the end of the simulations the model is still in the core - heating regime .",
    "as you can see in figure  [ dm_rho]a , at @xmath157  gyr the inner dm density profile is reasonably close to the initial one down to a radius of @xmath158  pc @xmath159 .    in the case of the burkert profile , the initial central velocity dispersion is also smaller than the dispersion at @xmath154 , though the difference is much smaller than for the case of nfw halo . in our model d@xmath71 ,",
    "we see a slight decrease in the dm density in the inner part of the halo at the end of the simulations ( figure  [ dm_rho]b ) , with a reasonably accurate profile down to a radius of @xmath160  pc @xmath161 .",
    "nfw and burkert models would be in equilibrium only if they had infinitive size and mass .",
    "as our models are truncated at at a finite radius @xmath75 , the dm density in the outer parts of the halos becomes lower with time .",
    "as you can see in figure  [ dm_rho ] , even at the end of the simulations the deviation of the outer dm density profile from the theoretical one is not significant within @xmath75 , and is negligible for @xmath162 .",
    "most of the changes in the outer density profiles happen within first one or two @xmath163 , which is comparable to the orbital period in models do@xmath30 and sdo@xmath30 .",
    "all the above let us conclude that the truncation of our models at the radius of @xmath75 should not have a noticeable impact on the results of our simulations .",
    "@xcite showed that an isotropic nfw subhalo , following a circular orbit inside the static potential of a host galaxy with nfw profile , can be completely disrupted by tidal forces after a few orbits if its tidal radius @xmath164 is smaller than @xmath165 .",
    "these authors argued that the relative easiness to disrupt an nfw satellite is linked to the fact that when an nfw halo is instantaneously truncated at a radius @xmath166 , it becomes unbound ( with the total energy @xmath167 of the remnant becoming positive ) .",
    "the situation with singular isothermal spheres is completely different , as such halos stay gravitationally bound for any @xmath168 , and potentially can survive indefinitely in an external tidal field .    in figure  [ e_tot ]",
    "we compare the binding properties of our nfw and burkert halos ( thick and thin long - dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "as you can see , burkert halos are similar to nfw ones in becoming unbound if truncated below a certain radius .",
    "burkert halos appear to be much easier to disrupt tidally than nfw halos : in the case of burkert profile , @xmath169 , which is @xmath170 times larger than for nfw profile . also , the positive total energy of a burkert halo truncated to @xmath171 is @xmath172 times larger than the corresponding quantity for an nfw halo with the same concentration and mass ( see figure  [ e_tot ] ) .    in figure  [ a_tid ]",
    "we compare the strength of the tidal force as a function of radius for two types of host galaxies : with nfw profile ( thick line ) and with burkert profile ( thin line ) .",
    "more specifically , in this figure we plot the radial dependence of the radial gradient of gravitational acceleration @xmath173 $ ] . a product of this quantity on the linear size of a subhalo gives an estimate of the differential ( tidal ) acceleration between two opposite parts of the subhalo .",
    "two vertical dotted lines in figure  [ a_tid ] show the range of radial distances covered by our models .",
    "as you can see in figure  [ a_tid ] , for nfw profile the quantity @xmath174 is always positive ( meaning that the tidal force is always stretching a subhalo in radial direction ) . in the small radii limit",
    ", @xmath174 asymptotically approaches a constant , which is equal to @xmath175^{-1}\\ , gm_{\\rm vir}/r_s^3 $ ] .",
    "for burkert halos , the radial tidal force reaches a maximum at @xmath176 , becomes equal to zero at @xmath177 , and asymptotically approaches a negative constant @xmath178^{-1}\\ , gm_{\\rm vir}/r_s^3 $ ] at small radii .",
    "the negative sign for @xmath174 means that at @xmath179 the radial tidal force becomes compressing instead of being stretching . in the interval of radii covered by the orbital motion of our subhalos ,",
    "the nfw host halo has significantly stronger radial tidal acceleration than the burkert halo ( see figure  [ a_tid ] ) .    to summarize the above analysis",
    ", the burkert halos are easier to disrupt tidally than nfw halos . on the other hand ,",
    "a tidal field of a burkert host galaxy appears to be less disrupting than that of an nfw host galaxy with the same mass and concentration .",
    "in addition , burkert halos have an unusual property of having a compressing radial tidal force within the scale radius @xmath21 .",
    "one has thus to resort to numerical simulations to understand differences in substructure evolution for nfw and burkert cases .      in our models",
    "do@xmath30 , a dm - only ( nfw or burkert ) subhalo is orbiting on eccentric ( @xmath53 ) orbit inside a static potential of the host ( nfw or burkert ) galaxy .",
    "we use the same definition of @xmath164 as @xcite :    @xmath180 \\frac{m(r)}{r^3}. \\label{eq_rtid}\\ ] ]    here @xmath181 and @xmath182 is enclosed mass as a function of radius for the host and satellite halos , respectively . at @xmath183 , the subhalos have the following values of tidal radii : @xmath184  pc @xmath185 for nfw profile , and @xmath186  pc @xmath187 for burkert profile .    in figure  [ dm_mass]a",
    ", we show the evolution of the gravitationally bound dm mass for model do@xmath188 ( solid thin line ) .",
    "as you can see , tidal stripping is severe in this model , with only @xmath189% of the total mass surviving as a bound structure after 11 orbits ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "this behavior is similar to the critical case of @xcite with @xmath190 ( see their fig .",
    "7 ) , which separates their models staying relatively intact ( with @xmath191 ) and completely disrupted models ( with @xmath192 ) . in our case",
    ", this ratio is slightly smaller than 2.1 : @xmath193 .",
    "slightly larger resilience to tidal disruption exhibited by our model do@xmath188 can be explained by the fact that @xcite used `` local maxwellian approximation '' to set up the initial particle distribution in their models , which according to @xcite leads to artificially high disruption rate for nfw subhalos .",
    "even for the very last snapshot of model do@xmath188 ( at @xmath138  gyr ) , the stripped - down subhalo appears to be reasonably stable against total disruption by the tidal forces .",
    "indeed , the binding radius of the remnant @xmath194  pc is significantly smaller than the current value of the tidal radius @xmath195  pc even at the very end of the simulations .",
    "( to estimate @xmath164 , we use the actual value of the pericentric distance of @xmath196  pc which is smaller than the original value of @xmath197  pc because of the dynamic friction experienced by the subhalo moving in the halo of unbound dm particles . )",
    "we expect thus that our nfw subhalo should survive as a gravitationally bound remnant for a few more orbits ( and perhaps indefinitely ) .",
    "the fate of a burkert dm subhalo orbiting inside a burkert host galaxy ( model do@xmath198 ) is completely different , as can be seen in figure  [ dm_mass]b ( solid thin line ) . after only 3 pericentric passages ,",
    "the subhalo ceases to exist as a coherent structure . to make sure that the failure to find a bound structure after @xmath199  gyr is not an artifact of our halo finding algorithm , we measure both binding radius @xmath200  pc and tidal radius @xmath201  pc for the last snapshot containing a bound structure . as you can see , at this point the subhalo is bound to be dispersed by tidal forces as its current tidal radius is significantly ( almost 4 times ) smaller than the binding radius .",
    "two main conclusions we arrive at in this section are ( 1 ) our nfw dm - only subhalo is relatively resilient to total tidal disruption , and ( 2 ) a burkert dm subhalo orbiting inside a burkert host galaxy is much easier to disrupt that for the case of an nfw dm subhalo orbiting inside an nfw host .",
    "we are now turning to the results of our two principle models : sdo@xmath69 and sdo@xmath71 .",
    "in these models , a hybrid gc ( stars @xmath72 dm ) is orbiting inside the same host galaxies and along the same eccentric orbit as in models do@xmath30 . before being placed in the static potential of the host galaxy , we allow stars and dm to relax in isolation for 120  myr ( model sdo@xmath69 ) and 170  myr ( model sdo@xmath71 ) .",
    "as you can see in figure  [ dm_mass ] , presence of a stellar core , with a mass of mere @xmath202% of the total mass , inside a dm subhalo makes the subhalo much more resilient to tidal forces disruption . in the case of nfw profile ( figure  [ dm_mass]a ; see also table  [ tab2 ] ) , the dm mass of the tidally stripped remnant at @xmath157  gyr is 7 times larger in the presence of the stellar core than in the dm - only case .",
    "it is also 3 times larger than the mass of the stellar core . for burkert profile ,",
    "the difference is even more dramatic : whereas a starless burkert subhalo is completely disrupted after 3 orbits , the subhalo with a stellar core survives till the end of the simulations , with @xmath203% of the total mass of the remnant being in dm form .",
    "figure  [ e_tot ] provides an explanation for such a marked difference . as we discussed in   [ prelim ] , both nfw and burkert halos become unbound if instantaneously truncated below a certain radius ( @xmath204 for nfw profile , and @xmath205 for burkert profile ) . as you can see in figure  [ e_tot ] , the presence of a stellar gc - like cluster at the center of either halo makes it significantly more bound . in the case of nfw profile ( thick solid line ) , the halo becomes bound for virtually any truncation radius @xmath168 ( being similar in this regard to a singular isothermal sphere ) .",
    "for burkert halo ( thin solid line ) , there is still a range in truncation radius @xmath168 where the halo is formally unbound , but the maximum positive value of @xmath167 is significantly lower in the presence of a stellar core .",
    "moreover , for @xmath206 the halo again becomes bound ( see figure  [ e_tot ] ) .",
    "after 7 orbits or @xmath207  gyr , the mass of dm gravitationally bound to the remnant in model sdo@xmath71 becomes smaller than the mass of the stellar core . at this point ,",
    "the rate of the mass loss due to tidal stripping becomes smaller , but still non - negligible ( see figure  [ dm_mass]b ) .",
    "we tested the possibility that the observed decrease in bound dm mass after @xmath208  gyr is a numerical artifact , caused by a small number ( @xmath209 ) of dm particles attached to the remnant , by resimulating the late evolution of the subhalo in the absence of the static gravitational potential of the host galaxy .",
    "for this , we used the gravitationally bound remnant from the @xmath210  gyr snapshot of model sdo@xmath71 .",
    "the bound dm mass evolution for this additional run is shown with dotted line in figure  [ dm_mass]b .",
    "as you can see , in the absence of external tidal field the bound dm mass of the remnant stays virtually constant .",
    "it appears thus very unlikely that the late time dm stripping observed in model sdo@xmath71 is caused by numerical artifacts ( such as evaporation of dm particles due to two - body interactions ) .    in figure",
    "[ column ] we show dm column density maps for models sdo@xmath69 ( left panels ) and sdo@xmath71 ( right panels ) , for two moments of time : after @xmath211 orbits ( top panels ) and after @xmath212 orbits ( bottom panels ) .",
    "two concentric circles show the range of radial distances covered by the models . at the earlier moment of time",
    ", you can see a long stream of dm particles , stripped during the first pericentric passage , with a relatively massive bound structure in the center of the stream . at the end of the simulations , multiple streams of stripped particles mix together to create a fuzzy thick disk of dm .",
    "the gravitationally bound remnant is barely visible at this point ( especially for burkert model ) .    in figure  [ dm_rho ]",
    "we show averaged dm radial density profiles for @xmath213  gyr for models d@xmath30 ( thick solid lines ) , sd@xmath30 ( thin solid lines ) , and sdo@xmath30 ( short - dashed lines ) . as you can see , the dm density in the innermost part of the nfw halo is not modified by external tidal field .",
    "outside of the stars - dominated central region , the dm density profile becomes significantly steeper in the presence of tidal field . at this point , in models sdo@xmath30 dm is stripped down to the original scale radius @xmath154 .",
    "analysis of table  [ tab2 ] shows that the parameters of our stellar clusters at the end of the simulations are very similar for all our models containing stars ( s , sd@xmath30 , and sdo@xmath30 ) . for sd@xmath69 and sdo@xmath69 models ,",
    "the presence of relatively large amounts of dm at the center of the cluster leads to somewhat larger values of the central dispersion @xmath95 and smaller values of the king core radius @xmath101 .",
    "the value of the apparent mass - to - light ratio @xmath103 , defined as ( see paper  i )    @xmath214    where @xmath215 is the assumed baryonic mass - to - light ratio in gcs and @xmath216 is the projected stellar surface mass density at the center of the cluster , is larger by @xmath148% for a stellar cluster in nfw halo .",
    "overall , the presence of an external tidal field does not seem to change the global structural and dynamic parameters of gcs with dm in a noticeable way .    as can be seen in figure  [ rho ] , tidal stripping does not modify significantly the stellar radial density profiles of hybrid gcs : at any moment of time , density profiles for sdo@xmath30 models ( dotted lines ) are very close to the density profiles of sd@xmath30 models ( solid lines ) .    in figure  [ rho2 ]",
    "we show the final radial density profiles for both stars and dm for models sdo@xmath69 and sdo@xmath71 .",
    "as you can see , dm still dominates stars in the outskirts of the stellar cluster . in the stars - dominated area ,",
    "the dm density profile is steeper because of the adiabatic contraction of dm in the presence of stars .",
    "dm density profiles are dramatically modified both by the presence of a stellar core and by tidal stripping .    in model sdo@xmath71 , stellar cluster becomes tidally limited by the end of the simulations . by @xmath138  gyr , around 0.6% of stars ( or @xmath217 stellar particles ) are not gravitationally bound to the cluster , forming distinctive trailing and leading stellar tidal tails .",
    "( conversely , not a single stellar particle has been tidally stripped by @xmath138  gyr in model sdo@xmath69 . ) in model sdo@xmath71 , the shape of the cluster becomes increasingly non - spherical at large radii at @xmath218  gyr . as can be seen in figure  [ sigma]a , there is an excess of stars in the outskirts of the cluster along its major axis , and a sharp tidal cutoff around the analytical tidal radius @xmath164 near the plane perpendicular to the major axis .",
    "( to calculate surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles for sdo@xmath71 model , we used all stellar particles  both bound and unbound . )    as figure  [ sigma]a shows , the final surface brightness profiles of the stellar clusters in sdo@xmath30 models look remarkably similar to the corresponding profiles of galactic gcs .",
    "( we assumed that the baryonic v - band mass - to - light ratio in gcs is @xmath219  see discussion in paper  i. ) the `` dent '' feature observed in the surface brightness profile of a freshly relaxed hybrid ( dm @xmath72 stars ) gc ( see paper  i ) has been removed in models sdo@xmath30 by secular evolution of the stellar cluster ( see   [ secular ] ) .",
    "the apparent `` tidal '' cutoff in the outer surface brightness profile of model sdo@xmath188 is caused by the presence of significant amounts of dm in the outskirts of the cluster ( similarly to paper  i ) . in the case of burkert halo ( model sdo@xmath198 ) ,",
    "the cutoff is of truly tidal nature .    in figure",
    "[ sigma]b we show the final line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles for the stellar clusters in sdo@xmath30 models . in the case of nfw halo ( thick solid line )",
    ", the line - of - sight velocity dispersion appears to be uniformly inflated by a small factor ( @xmath127% ) across all radii , which can be misinterpreted as a purely stellar cluster with a somewhat larger value of baryonic mass - to - light ratio . for the burkert halo ( thin solid lines ) ,",
    "the radial velocity dispersion profile for the stars near the plane perpendicular to the major axis is very close to the profile of a purely stellar cluster , whereas the stars along the major axis show signs of being tidally heated .",
    "dm subhalos with burkert density profile are much easier to disrupt tidally in the potential of the host galaxy than subhalos with nfw profile .",
    "we link this effect to the difference in the binding properties of both types of halos , with the total energy of the burkert halos becoming positive if truncated at a significantly larger radius than for nfw halos . setting a low - mass ( @xmath220% of the total mass ) dense stellar core at the center of either nfw or burkert halo",
    "makes them much more resilient to tidal disruption .",
    "primordial gcs with nfw dm halo can survive severe tidal stripping in the host galaxy , with dm still being the dominant mass component ( though not by a large margin ) in the tidally stripped - down remnant .",
    "dm is concentrated in the outskirts of the remnant . as a result , an apparent `` tidal '' cutoff in the radial surface brightness profile in isolated warm collapse models ( paper  i ) , caused by the presence of dm , is also present in our tidally stripped nfw model .",
    "we used warm collapse hybrid models to show that neither secular evolution of the stellar cluster nor severe tidal stripping change noticeably the inferred core mass - to - light ratio @xmath103 . for both flat - core and cuspy dm halo profiles",
    ", @xmath103 stays close to the purely baryonic value .",
    "tidal stripping can remove almost all dm from primordial gcs with burkert dm halo .",
    "the remaining dm is dynamically unimportant , and can not prevent stars being stripped off by tidal forces of the host galaxy .",
    "this result makes gcs possessing obvious tidal tails ( the only known example being palomar  5 ) be fully consistent with primordial scenarios of gc formation .    secular evolution of a dm - dominated gc does not change the main results of paper  i derived for freshly relaxed warm - collapse systems . in particular , in both unevolved and evolved clusters , presence of significant amounts of dm in the outskirts of the cluster manifest itself as a `` tidal '' cutoff in the outer part of the radial surface brightness profile .",
    "it is not clear if the `` extratidal '' features of cold collapse models from paper  i will be preserved in significantly evolved clusters . as we discussed in ",
    "[ physical ] , simulating a cold - collapse hybrid gc to address this issue is not feasible with the present day technology .",
    "the above results reinforce our conclusion from paper  i that a presence of obvious tidal tails is probably the only observational evidence which can reliably rule out a presence of significant amounts of dm in gcs .",
    "( but it can not rule out primordial scenarios of gc formation . )    to summarize , the results presented in both paper  i and this paper suggest that the whole range of features seen in milky way gcs ( from apparently truncated profiles of some clusters to the extended tidal tails of palomar  5 ) can be consistent with the primordial picture of gc formation , given that there was a range of the initial virial ratios for stellar clusters ( from `` cold '' to `` hot '' collapses ) , tidal stripping histories , and/or inner dm density profiles .",
