    "dilute granular systems , or _",
    "gases _ , have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically , in large part as simple model systems exhibiting nonequilibrium and dissipative behavior .",
    "these systems are intrinsically dissipative and out of equilibrium , even though it is tempting to apply such equilibrium notions as temperature . since the collisions in such a gas are inelastic , it is necessary to supply energy , or to drive them in order to maintain a gas - like steady state . otherwise , _",
    "inelastic collapse _ can occur , in which all motion ceases after only a finite time@xcite . in principle , it is possible to heat or drive the system uniformly throughout the container ( _ uniform heating _ ) , as has been done in simulations@xcite , and as is assumed in analytic theories@xcite . in experiments , however , one usually drives a granular gas by shaking or vibrating the walls of the container .",
    "such _ boundary heating _ means that the energy is inserted in a spatially inhomogeneous way@xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the gas will develop a gradient in density and mean kinetic energy .    even for uniform heating , however , significant deviations from equilibrium gases , e.g. , in density correlations , are observed@xcite .",
    "it is often assumed that in the bulk , where the boundaries are far away and spatial gradients are small on the scale of the mean free path of the particles , both heating methods should give the same behavior . here",
    ", we show that there are striking differences in the behavior of granular gases heated uniformly or through the boundary .",
    "there has been much interest recently in another aspect of these non - equilibrium gases : namely , the velocity distributions .",
    "this is in part because they deviate from the gaussian distributions that one would expect if the collisions were elastic .",
    "it has been suggested that the velocity distributions can be described by a sort - of _ stretched _ gaussian , of the form @xmath6 $ ] , where @xmath7 is sometimes called the granular temperature .",
    "rouyer and menon @xcite have reported such a distribution with exponent @xmath8 over the whole observed range of velocities , which was unaffected by changes in amplitude and frequency of driving .",
    "this observation was particularly intriguing , given the theoretical predictions obtained before by van noije and ernst @xcite .",
    "they developed a kinetic theory that predicts a high - velocity tail described by a distribution with an exponent @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately , results for velocity distributions are never unambiguous . both in simulation and experiment , different setups and driving mechanisms",
    "usually give different behavior of the velocity distribution . for a setup where particles on a horizontal plate were driven in the vertical direction , olafsen and",
    "urbach @xcite found a crossover from exponential to gaussian distributions as the amplitude of the driving was increased .",
    "the result of rouyer and menon @xcite was obtained for a different configuration where particles were confined between two vertical plates and driven in the vertical direction .",
    "although the exponent @xmath8 they find is reminiscent of theoretical results obtained by van noije and ernst @xcite , both results are actually inconsistent in that the exponent @xmath9 can only describe the high - velocity tail of the distribution .",
    "such a high - velocity tail was actually obtained by moon et al .",
    "@xcite . using a simulation with a variation on uniform heating",
    "they find a velocity distribution that has an exponent of @xmath10 for low velocities , but crosses over to an exponent of @xmath8 for the high - velocity tail .",
    "the results of rouyer and menon are also limited in the sense that they were obtained for almost elastic particles with @xmath11 .",
    "blair and kudrolli @xcite use a different setup where particles move along an inclined plane .",
    "friction with the plane during collisions reduces the coefficient of restitution to @xmath12 .",
    "they find the distribution with exponent @xmath8 only in the very dilute case .",
    "otherwise , the distributions deviate strongly from both gaussian and the distribution obtained by rouyer and menon .",
    "it is interesting to notice that for the denser case blair and kudrolli find a distribution with a crossover much like the type observed by moon et al .    at present",
    "there is no agreement on what the velocity distribution of a granular gas looks like exactly nor is it clear what causes the velocity distributions to deviate from a gaussian .",
    "puglisi et al .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the deviations are caused by the spatial correlations in the gas .",
    "they propose that for a region of uniform density the velocity distribution of the gas actually is gaussian , with a density dependent width .",
    "the spatial correlations cause density fluctuations and they claim that the non - gaussian distributions arise as an average over the velocity distributions over these regions of different density .",
    "it is true that an average over gaussian distributions with different widths in general yields a stretched gaussian , but experiments performed by olafsen and urbach @xcite showed that this does not happen in granular gases .",
    "they find that even within small windows of uniform density the velocity distributions remained non - gaussian . here",
    ", we show that non - gaussian behavior arises even in a simple model with no spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "we study behavior of the velocity distributions of the granular gas as a function of @xmath1 , the area fraction , and @xmath0 , the coefficient of restitution . specifically , we consider the effect on the velocity distribution of driving the gas by heating uniformly , as is assumed in theory and many prior simulations , and by heating through a boundary , as is done in most experiments .",
    "we will show that there exists clear qualitative difference between the velocity distributions for uniform and boundary heating .",
    "furthermore , we will show that there is no evidence for a universal velocity distribution with a constant exponent @xmath8 .",
    "we demonstrate instead that a family of distributions showing apparent exponents covering a wide range of values @xmath13 is expected , depending on both material and experimental conditions .",
    "furthermore , we show that the velocity distribution is governed primarily by the relative importance of collisions to heating , _",
    "i.e. _ , the way in which energy flows through the system of particles .",
    "specifically , we introduce a new parameter @xmath2 , which measures the ratio between mean numbers of heating events @xmath14 and mean number of collisions @xmath15 experienced by a typical particle .",
    "these theoretical observations can explain both the observed non - gaussian behavior , as well as the ambiguities in the experimental and theoretical literature on dissipative gases to date .",
    "we also demonstrate that the behavior of the velocity distributions can be captured quantitatively by a simple model that takes only @xmath0 and @xmath3 into account , with no spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "we use an event - driven algorithm to simulate @xmath16 particles of radius @xmath17 moving in a two - dimensional box .",
    "particles gain energy by heating and lose energy through inelastic collisions .",
    "when two particles @xmath18 and @xmath19 collide their final velocities depend on their initial velocities in the following way : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the coefficient of restitution and @xmath22 is the unit vector connecting the centers of particles @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    for uniform heating we adapted an one - dimensional algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "when heating uniformly , each individual particle is heated by adding a random amount to the velocity of each particle during a time step @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a vector whose components are uniformly distributed between @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 is proportional to the heating rate .",
    "after heating the system is transferred to the center - of - mass frame .",
    "particles move in a box with sides @xmath29 .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions to simulate bulk behavior .",
    "the time step @xmath23 is chosen in such a way that on average the number of collisions per time step is less than one .",
    "it should be noted that this heating mechanism is significantly different from the spatially homogeneous heating used in some experiments @xcite . in the experiment",
    "all particles feel the same forcing , so the motion of the neighboring particles is strongly correlated in space and time . in uniform heating however , all particles",
    "are independently driven by a stochastic source and as a consequence correlations are very weak .    when heating through the boundaries , particles gain velocity upon collision with the boundary .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the collision with the boundary is elastic . in that case , a collision occurs by reflecting @xmath30 , the component of the velocity perpendicular to the boundary .",
    "heating occurs by adding a random amount of velocity to @xmath30 .",
    "then after collision with the boundary one has : @xmath31 particles move in a circular box of radius @xmath32 .",
    "a symmetrical container has the advantage that it allows us to examine density and granular temperature gradients along a single coordinate @xmath17 , the distance from the center of the box , as in the one - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "we start the simulation by distributing the particles uniformly over the box .",
    "when using boundary heating , we give each particle a small , uniformly distributed velocity to enable particles to reach the boundary",
    ". then particles are heated and we allow the system to reach a steady state before taking data . for both uniform heating and boundary heating , data is taken periodically every time step @xmath23 . for uniform heating",
    ", data is taken when the particles are heated , so @xmath23 equals the time between heating events .",
    "one of the first striking differences between uniform heating and boundary heating is clustering .",
    "when heating through the boundary , a stable liquid - like cluster surrounded by a hot gaseous state will form for low coefficients of restitution @xmath0 or high area fraction @xmath1 .",
    "this occurs as particles are compressed in the center of the box by the pressure of particles moving in from the boundary .",
    "as the cluster grows in size , it can no longer be destroyed by the impact of high velocity particles and the cluster remains stable .",
    "a typical example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] .",
    "we do not find these clusters when heating uniformly .",
    "this is because all particles are heated all the time , which prevents the collapse to a cluster . in experiments that find clusters in homogeneously driven systems",
    "@xcite this is different , because here the driven motion of neighboring particles is highly correlated .",
    "the formation of a cluster spoils measurement of the velocity distribution because the system is no longer in a pure gas - like state . to avoid values of @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath0 corresponding to the formation of clusters in our simulation , we constructed a phase diagram .",

    "ulam found that , regardless of the initial velocities , the system quickly evolved to a state where on average all energy was distributed equally over all particles and the deviation of the velocities of the particles around the average velocity of the system was given by the maxwell - bolzmann distribution .",
    "this approximation of random collisions is only justified when the gas is sufficiently dilute .",
    "the same approximation can also be made for the granular gas by replacing the elastic collisions between particles with inelastic collisions .",

    "due to the idealized nature of our system , it is not possible to do a direct comparison between our simulation and experiments . in the experiment of rouyer and menon",
    "the driving is through the boundary , but there are some significant differences between their heating mechanism and the one we use in simulations with boundary heating . due to gravity and the geometry of the setup",
    "the injection of energy in the experiment of rouyer and menon is mainly in the vertical direction .",
    "this energy is transferred into the horizontal direction by collisions between particles .",
    "another difference is that in the experiment the frequency of driving is relatively low . because of this the dynamics of the gas close to the driving boundary is strongly dependend on the phase of the driving cycle .",
    "in fact , it has been shown in simulation that for a system similar to the experiment by rouyer and menon , a shockwave propagates up through the gas @xcite . at a certain distance from the boundary",
    "the time dependence has decayed away and the gas enters a steady state .",
    "it is in this steady state that the velocity distributions are measured .",
    "it is not yet established how this time dependence and the occurence of a shock wave influences the velocity distributions in the steady state . a priori it is not clear if it is possible to compare velocity distributions in systems with a strong time - dependence , like the experiments , with those that have no time dependence , as is the case in our simulations .",
    "there are , however , reasons to assume this is possible .",
    "the velocity distributions in the experiment of rouyer and menon are measured only in the direction orthogonal to the driving direction .",
    "simulations @xcite show that the effect of the shock in the direction orthogonal to the shock are usually relatively weak and decay rapidly in height . in the steady state ,",
    "influence of the shock is absent in the orthogonal direction , even while it still may be apparent in the direction perpendicular to the driving direction .",
    "so , if we only look at velocity distributions in the orthogonal direction and in the steady state , a comparison between the experiment and our simulations is be valid .",
    "it is also not clear how in the experiments the dynamics of the gas shape the velocity distribution and whether it is controlled by the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we speculate that in the steady state the system behaves in fact like a one dimensional inelastic gas .",
    "fast upward moving particles inject energy in the orthogonal direction when colliding with particles in the steady state , effectively functioning as a heat source . in this picture",
    "the mean number of collisions between fast upwards moving particles and particles in the steady state would be @xmath14 , the average number of heatings , and collisions between the particles in the steady state mutually would be @xmath15 , the average number of collisions . one way of changing the shape of the velocity distribution would be changing the fraction of particles in the steady state .",
    "more particles in the steady state would lower @xmath14 and increase @xmath15 leading to more non - gaussian velocity distributions .",
    "the above considerations not only apply to the experiment of rouyer and menon but to most of the other experiments as well . in the experiments of blair and kudrolli and those of olafsen and urbach velocity distributions",
    "are measured orthogonal to the driving direction . in both cases",
    "it is not so much the collisions with the bottom plate that drive the gas in the ortogonal directions , but mainly collisions between fast upward moving particles with particles that have low velocities in the orthogonal directions .",
    "it is in these experiments rather than those of rouyer and menon that we find a similar dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath3 as we describe in this article .    in the setup of olafsen and urbach",
    "@xcite velocity distributions go from non - gaussian to gaussian when a rough plate is used instead of a flat plate . on a flat plate , energy",
    "is only injected in the in - plane directions by off - angle collisions between neighboring particles . with a rough plate ,",
    "energy is injected directly into the directions parallel to the plate every time a particle collides with the plate , effectively increasing the number of heatings over collisions .",
    "baxter and olafsen @xcite observe the same behavior in a system where a layer of heavy particles is inserted between the other layer of particles and a flat bottom plate .",
    "particles from the upper layer have off - angle collisions with the layer of heavy particles , injecting energy in the in - plane directions every cycle .",
    "particles in the upper layer show gaussian velocity distributions , whereas particles in the lower layer have non - gaussian velocity distributions .",
    "most convincing is the experiment by blair and kudrollli @xcite . here",
    "the number of collisions is increased by adding more particles . as a result",
    ", their velocity distributions develop the same crossover we see both in our simulations and model . the reason why these transitions are not visible in the experiment by rouyer and menon as they increase number of particles ,",
    "is that in the first case the effective coefficient of restitution is much lower , @xmath190 , due to friction with the inclined plane .",
    "again , one of the main problems considering the velocity distributions in granular gases is that different setups and experiments usually find different velocity distributions . as we have shown in this section",
    ", our finding of the controlling parameter @xmath3 could ultimately explain these seemingly inconsistent results .",
    "we compared the velocity distributions of a granular gas that was driven by uniform heating and by heating through the boundary .",
    "although it is usually assumed that uniform heating yields the same behavior as boundary heating when the boundary is far away and the spatial gradients are small , we find that there are clear qualitative differences .",
    "when driven through the boundary , for instance , the gas can form coexisting cool liquid - like clusters surrounded by a hot gaseous state for certain values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "such clusters do not occur in our simulations with uniform heating .",
    "the difference between uniform heating and boundary heating also extends to the velocity distributions . for uniform heating ,",
    "we find velocity distributions that are close to gaussian over the observed range of velocities and for a wide range of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "when heating through the boundaries , on the other hand , we find that velocity distributions are stretched gaussians that usually cross over from one exponent @xmath81 to another for the high - velocity tail .",
    "for the high - velocity tail we find that the exponent @xmath81 varies over a wide range . for strong dissipation",
    "this tail can not be described by a single exponent .",
    "this means that there is no universal velocity distribution with @xmath8 , as was proposed by rouyer and menon . instead",
    ", the velocity distribution found by rouyer and menon may be just one out of the many distributions described here .",
    "the apparent universality may be due to the use of a narrow range of parameters ( nearly elastic particles were used with @xmath11 and vary @xmath191 ) .",
    "we find that varying @xmath1 only has a minor effect on the shape of the distribution when @xmath0 is so close to the elastic limit . for low @xmath0 ,",
    "we instead find velocity distributions that look much like the distributions found by blair and kudrolli for gases with @xmath190 .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the distribution of velocities for dissipative gases , while not universal in form , depends only on two parameters : the coefficient of restitution @xmath0 ( a material parameter ) and @xmath2 , the average ratio of heatings and collisions in the gas ( a function of experimental conditions ) .",
    "we find that velocity distributions range from gaussian for @xmath4 , where heating dominates dissipation , to strongly non - gaussian for @xmath184 , where the dynamics of the gas is dominated by the dissipative collisions between particles .",
    "the differences in distributions we find between uniform and boundary heating can then be understood as different limits of @xmath3 , for @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "we can control the parameter @xmath3 more easily using two - point heating and here we observe the transistion form gaussian to strongly non - gaussian behavior directly as we change @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , a simple model of a driven , inelastic gas without spatial degrees of freedom reproduces the entire family of velocity distributions we find in simulation , as we vary @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "this means that the velocity distributions are non - gaussian not because of spatial correlations .",
    "rather , it is the cascade of energy from a few high - energy particles to the slow - moving bulk of the gas that is the key determinant of the non - gaussian velocity distributions .",
    "these observations should aid in the construction of a kinetic theory of dissipative gases .",
