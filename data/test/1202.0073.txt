    "topological fluctuations of the order parameter field , so - called little s phase slips ,  @xcite are at the heart of superconductivity at the nanoscale .",
    "@xcite these unavoidable stochastic events give rise to the finite resistivity of nanowires below the mean - field transition temperature .",
    "thermally activated phase slips ( tapss ) have been routinely observed experimentally ; see ref .   for a review .",
    "however , at low temperatures , phase - slip events are triggered by intrinsic quantum fluctuations ,  @xcite so they are called quantum phase slips ( qpss ) and represent a particular case of macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) .",
    "a clear and unambiguous demonstration of mqt in homogeneous superconductors is of great importance , from both the fundamental and the technological prospectives .",
    "it has been argued recently by mooij and nazarov  @xcite that a wire where coherent qpss take place may be regarded as a new circuit element , the phase - slip junction , which is a dual counterpart of the josephson junction .",
    "@xcite the proposed phase - slip qubit  @xcite and other coherent devices  @xcite may be useful in the realization of a new current standard .",
    "furthermore , comprehensive study of qpss may elucidate the microscopic nature of superconductor - insulator quantum phase transition in nanowires .",
    "@xcite    it is difficult to obtain firm conclusions about the presence of qpss by means of low - bias resistance measurements because the resistance drops to zero at relatively high temperatures .",
    "measured in the linear transport regime , high - resistance wires seemingly exhibit qpss ,  @xcite while low - resistance wires probably do not .",
    "@xcite for high - bias currents , on the other hand , sahu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained strong evidence supporting the quantum nature of phase slips by measuring switching - current distributions .",
    "the observed drop of the switching - current dispersion with increasing temperature was explained by a delicate interplay between quantum and multiple thermal phase slips . recently",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite provided direct experimental evidence that , at sufficiently low temperatures , _ each _ phase slip causes nanowire switching from superconducting to the normal state by creating a hot spot .",
    "@xcite the destruction of superconductivity occurs by means of overheating the wire caused by a single phase slip .",
    "thus the dispersion of phase - slip events is equivalent to the dispersion of the switching current .",
    "we build on these previous findings and reveal mqt in homogeneous nanowires via the quantitative study of current - voltage characteristics .",
    "first , we examine the higher - temperature regime , @xmath3 , and identify thermal phase slips through the temperature dependence of the switching - current standard deviation @xmath4 , which obeys the 2/3 power law predicted by kurkijrvi .",
    "@xcite at lower temperatures , @xmath5 , a clear saturation of @xmath4 is observed ; this behavior is indicative of mqt .",
    "important evidence in favor of qpss is provided by the fact that the mean value of the switching current keeps increasing with cooling even when the associated dispersion is already saturated .",
    "we observe a linear scaling of the saturation temperature @xmath0 with the critical temperature @xmath1 of the wire .",
    "we also show that such behavior is in agreement with our generalization of the mqt theory .",
    "this fact provides extra assurance that other mechanisms , such as electromagnetic ( em ) noise or inhomogeneities , are not responsible for the observed behavior .",
    "furthermore , we achieve _ controllable tunability _ of the wire morphology by utilizing a recently developed voltage pulsation technique .",
    "@xcite the pulsation allows us to gradually crystallize the wire and to change its @xmath1 _ in situ_. the fact that the qps manifestations are qualitatively the same in both amorphous and crystallized wires eliminates the possibility that the observed mqt behavior is caused by the presence of weak links .",
    "thus we provide conclusive evidence for the existence of qpss in homogeneous wires in the nonlinear regime of high - bias currents .",
    "superconducting nanowires were fabricated by molecular templating .",
    "@xcite briefly , a single - wall carbon nanotube is suspended across a trench etched in a silicon wafer .",
    "the nanotube and the entire surface of the chip are then coated with 10 - 20  nm of the superconducting alloy mo@xmath6ge@xmath7 using dc magnetron sputtering .",
    "thus a nanowire , seamlessly connected to thin film electrodes at its ends , forms on the surface of the electrically insulating nanotube .",
    "the electrodes approaching the wire are between @xmath8 and @xmath9 m wide .",
    "the gap between the electrodes , in which the nanowire is located , is 100  nm .",
    "the signal lines in the he-3 cryostat were heavily filtered to eliminate electromagnetic noise , using copper - powder and silver - paste filters at low temperatures and @xmath10 filters at room temperature .",
    "@xcite to measure switching - current distributions , the bias current was gradually increased from zero to a value that is about 20% higher than the critical current ( 1 - 10  @xmath11a ) .",
    "such large sweeps ensure that each measured @xmath12-@xmath13 curve exhibits a jump from the zero - voltage state to the resistive normal state .",
    "such a jump is defined as the switching current @xmath14 , and @xmath15 switching events were detected at each temperature through repetitions of the @xmath12-@xmath13 curve measurements @xmath16 times .",

    "such modifications of @xmath1 and @xmath18 have been explained by morphological changes , as the amorphous molybdenum germanium ( mo@xmath6ge@xmath7 ) gradually transforms into single - crystal mo@xmath19ge , caused by the joule heating brought about by the voltage pulses .",

    "the higher - temperature regime of taps appears in good agreement with the kg theory .",
    "all our amorphous wires show properties somewhat similar to jjs ( @xmath49 ) , indicating that the barrier for phase slips depends on the bias current as @xmath50 .",
    "the two pulsed and crystallized wires agree better with the predictions of psj model for perfectly homogeneous one - dimensional ( 1d ) wires ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the qps phenomenon is present in both types of wires , as is evidenced by the observed saturation of the dispersion .",
    "thus we conclude that the qps is ubiquitous , as it occurs in amorphous wires and in 1d crystalline wires .",
    "note that the pulsed crystalline wires are more into the 1d limit since their coherence length is larger while their diameter , measured under scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) , is not noticeably affected by the pulsing crystallization [ see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] .",
    "now let us focus on the quantum fluctuations represented by the saturation of @xmath4 at low temperatures @xmath5 .",
    "the observed crossover is a key signature of mqt .",
    "strong evidence that the saturation is not due to any sort of em noise or an uncontrolled overheating of electrons above the bath temperature follows from the fact that although @xmath4 is constant at @xmath5 , the switching current keeps growing with cooling , even at @xmath5 [ see figs .",
    "[ fig1](c ) and [ fig1](d ) ] .",
    "the observed saturation of @xmath4 for @xmath5 and the simultaneous increase of @xmath52 with cooling at @xmath5 are in agreement with the qps theoretical fits of the kg theory ( fig .",

    "@xcite the critical current at zero temperature @xmath54 and @xmath1 are used as fitting parameters .",
    "such mqt - reassuring behavior ( i.e. , saturation of @xmath4 when @xmath17 does not show saturation ) has not been observed previously on superconducting nanowires and constitutes our key evidence for qpss .",
    "conventionally , the crossover temperature @xmath0 between regimes dominated by thermal or quantum phase slips is defined as a temperature at which the thermal activation exponent becomes equal to the quantum action , both evaluated at zero - bias current .",
    "@xcite such definition is limited to small - bias currents ; thus it is not applicable to our study since it neglects the role of the bias current , which in our case is the key control parameter.@xcite    alternatively , the strength of a phase - slip mechanism can be described by the deviation of the average switching current from the idealized critical current of the device @xmath18 , which is the switching current in the absence of stochastically induced phase slips .",
    "such a characterization provides an assessment of the tunneling rate since it is the latter which determines @xmath52 . using @xmath55 as a measure of a phase - slip tunneling rate and accounting for the fact that the idealized critical current of the device is a phase - slip - independent quantity , we arrive at the following implicit definition of the crossover temperature @xmath0 : @xmath56 where 1 and 2 denote two phase slip - driving mechanisms .",
    "assuming that @xmath57 can be represented by a generic expression ( [ isw ] ) and that parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath37 can be specified for a particular phase - slip mechanism , the above equation reduces to @xmath61 constant @xmath62 depends only logarithmically on temperature and other parameters ; such dependence is subleading and will be neglected . through tunneling rates",
    "@xmath63 as described above also leads to eq .",
    "( [ b = b ] ) with , however , different value of @xmath64 . ]    to calculate @xmath0 using eq .  ( [ b = b ] ) knowledge of phase - slip parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 is required . for a long wire in the taps regime",

    "the value of @xmath77 ( the exponent which governs the current dependence of the qps action ) is poorly known .",
    "motivated by the fact that the fits to rates @xmath78 shown on fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) are made with the same value of @xmath37 for all temperatures and match the data well , we make a plausible assumption that @xmath79 . then , combining eq .",
    "( [ b = b ] ) with the expressions for @xmath80 and @xmath81 given above , one arrives at the conclusion that @xmath82 .",
    "this is in agreement with our experimental finding that @xmath83 .",
    "the observed coefficient of proportionality 0.16 implies that @xmath84 . given by golubev and zaikin in ref .",
    "is different by a numerical factor of order 5 from that used by tinkham and lau in ref .  .",
    "had we used the latter expression the value of this product would be reduced by a corresponding factor . ]    in practice , when looking for mqt / qpss through the temperature dependence of the switching - current distribution , one has to worry about the alternative explanation that the @xmath4 saturation is caused by the presence of a constant noise level .",
    "such saturation , if present , can also be analyzed in the framework outlined above . modeling noise as a thermal bath with temperature @xmath85 one obtains that the crossover temperature to the noise - dominated phase - slip regime is equal to @xmath85 and hence does not correlate with @xmath1 , which is in contrast to our observation , [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] .",
    "we also argue that wires which are less susceptible to the noise , i.e. , the wires with higher critical temperatures and therefore larger barriers for phase slips , exhibit more pronounced quantum effects ; i.e. , their saturation temperature @xmath0 is larger . we conclude therefore that the correlation between the crossover temperature and the critical temperature , observed in our experiment [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] , is strong evidence in favor of mqt below @xmath0 .",
    "the saturation of @xmath4 at low temperatures is seen on all tested samples , a - f [ fig .",

    "samples e and f have relatively low critical currents .",
    "this fact leads to the occurrence of multi - phase - slip switching events ( mpsse ) , manifested by the characteristic drop of @xmath4 with increasing @xmath30 , observed at higher temperatures .",
    "such a drop was already observed on nanowires with relatively low critical currents ( between 1.1 and 6.1 @xmath11a ) in refs .  , which represents an important consistency check for our findings .",
    "here we focus on samples with higher critical currents , which do not exhibit mpsses and do not analyze our samples e and f , which exhibit mpsses [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "in summary , we demonstrate that in nanowires at moderately high temperatures , @xmath86 , the switching into the normal state at high bias is governed by tapss .",
