    "extremely low mass ( elm ) wds , degenerate objects with @xmath5 ( cm s@xmath6 ) surface gravity or @xmath70.3 @xmath4  mass , are the product of common envelope binary evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "elm wds are thus the signposts of the type of binaries that are strong gravitational wave sources and possible supernovae progenitors .",
    "the goal of the elm survey is to discover and characterize the population of elm wds in the milky way .",
    "previous elm survey papers have reported the discovery of 40 wds spanning 0.16 @xmath4  to 0.49 @xmath4  found in the hypervelocity star ( hvs ) survey , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and in our own targeted survey @xcite .",
    "we refer to this full sample of wds as the elm survey sample , but reserve the term `` elm wd '' for those objects with @xmath5 .",
    "all of our wds are found in short - period , detached binaries , 60% of which have merger times @xmath210 gyr .",
    "three notable systems are detached binaries with @xmath240 min orbital periods @xcite . the eclipsing system j0651",
    "+ 2844 is the second - strongest gravitational wave source in the mhz range @xcite .",
    "we measured its period change in one year with optical eclipse timing @xcite .",
    "other results from the elm survey include the first tidally distorted wds @xcite and the first pulsating helium - core wds @xcite .    here",
    "we present the discovery of 17 new wd binaries identified from spectra previously obtained for the hvs survey of @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the visually - identified wds in the original dataset and discovered one elm wd binary @xcite .",
    "this approach failed to identify the lowest surface gravity wds .",
    "we now fit stellar atmosphere models to the entire collection of spectra not previously identified as wds , and acquire follow - up spectroscopy of new elm wd candidates .",
    "the result of this effort is that we find low surface gravity objects that might not be considered wds if not for their observed orbital motion .",
    "we chose to call objects with @xmath8 `` elm wds '' because these objects occupy a unique region of surface gravity / effective temperature space that overlaps the terminal wd cooling branch for elm wds ( see figure [ fig : teff ] ) .",
    "this region is well separated from both hydrogen - burning main sequence tracks and helium - burning horizontal branch tracks .",
    "our objects are systematically @xmath910,000 k too cool , given their surface gravities , to be helium burning sdb stars .",
    "@xcite refer to a similar type of object as a `` proto - wd . ''",
    "the lowest gravity objects in our sample may indeed have hydrogen shell burning and thus are , properly speaking , proto - wds , but here we address our sample of low gravity objects as elm wds .",
    "a variety of observations demonstrate that degenerate helium - core wds exist at our observed temperatures and surface gravities .",
    "elm wd companions to milli - second pulsars are directly observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the temperatures and gravities targeted by the elm survey .",
    "the measured radius of the @xmath10 object in j0651 + 2844 , a @xmath11 @xmath12  star , demonstrates it is a degenerate wd @xcite .",
    "@xcite account for the unusually long pulsation periods of the elm wd pulsators with low mass wd models .",
    "hence , calling our low surface gravity objects elm wds is appropriate .",
    "interestingly , we find elm wds in binaries with @xmath130.9 @xmath4  companions and rapid merger times .",
    "when these detached binaries begin mass transfer , @xcite show that the extreme mass ratios will lead to stable mass transfer . for the case of massive wd accretors ,",
    "theorists predict large helium flashes that may ignite thermonuclear transients dubbed `` .ia '' supernovae @xcite or may detonate the surface helium - layer and the massive wd @xcite and produce an underluminous supernova .",
    "however , the final outcome of such mergers is uncertain and they may not trigger supernovae explosions @xcite . if the companions are instead neutron stars , this would be the first time a milli - second pulsar is identified through its low - mass wd companion .",
    "such systems allow measurement of the binary mass ratio and the neutron star mass through a combination of the pulsar orbit obtained from radio timing and the wd orbit obtained from optical radial velocity observations .",
    "the importance of identifying the elm wds in the hvs survey is that the hvs survey is a well - defined and a nearly 100% complete spectroscopic survey .",
    "with a complete sample of elm wds we can measure the space density , period distribution , and merger rate of elm wds , and link elm wd merger products to populations of am cvn stars , r crb stars , and possibly underluminous supernovae . in a stellar evolution context , our elm wd survey complements studies of wd binaries with main sequence companions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and with sdb star companions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sdb stars are @xmath14@xmath15 k helium - burning precursors to wds @xcite .",
    "our elm wds , on the other hand , have @xmath14@xmath16 k.    we organize this paper as follows . in section 2",

    "we discuss the properties of the elm wd sample .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "the hvs survey is a targeted spectroscopic survey of @xmath17 stars with the colors of @xmath183 @xmath4  main sequence stars , stars which should not exist at faint magnitudes in the halo unless they were ejected there .",
    "the target selection is detailed in @xcite and spans @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "this color selection fortuitously targets wds in the approximate range @xmath21 @xmath14  @xmath16 k and @xmath22 .",
    "we separate elm wds from the other stars in the hvs survey using stellar atmosphere model fits to the single - epoch spectra .",
    "our initial set of fits uses an upgraded version of the ferre code described by @xcite and synthetic da wd pure hydrogen spectra kindly provided by d.  koester .",
    "the grid of wd model atmospheres covers effective temperatures from 6000 k to 30,000 k in steps of 500 k to 2000 k , and surface gravities from @xmath23=5.0 to 9.0 in steps of 0.25 dex .",
    "the model atmospheres are calculated assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and include both convective and radiative transport @xcite .",
    "we fit 2,000 spectra , mostly from the original hvs survey @xcite but also some newly acquired data @xcite .",
    "these 2,000 spectra were not previously analyzed for the elm survey because the spectra were not previously identified as wds .",
    "we fit both flux - calibrated spectra ( for improved @xmath14  constraints ) as well as continuum - corrected balmer line profiles ( insensitive to reddening and flux calibration errors ) . for the continuum - corrected balmer line profiles ,",
    "we normalize the spectra by fitting a low - order polynomial to the regions between the balmer lines .",
    "we adopt the parameters from the flux - calibrated spectra , except in cases where the spectra were obtained in non - photometric conditions .",
    "the uncertainties in our single - epoch measurements are typically @xmath24500 k in @xmath14  and @xmath25 dex in @xmath23 . from these fits",
    "we identify 57 low mass wd candidates .",
    "we obtain follow - up spectra for each of the candidate low mass wds to improve stellar atmosphere parameters and to search for velocity variability .",
    "observations were obtained over the course of seven observing runs at the 6.5 m mmt telescope between march 2011 and february 2013 .",
    "we used the blue channel spectrograph @xcite with the 832 line mm@xmath26 grating , which provides a wavelength coverage 3650   to 4500   and a spectral resolution of 1.0  .",
    "all observations were paired with a comparison lamp exposure , and were flux - calibrated using blue spectrophotometric standards @xcite .",
    "the extracted spectra typically have a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of 7 per pixel in the continuum and a 14 km s@xmath26  radial velocity error .",
    "we obtained additional spectroscopy for @xmath27 mag elm wd candidates in queue scheduled time at the 1.5 m flwo telescope .",
    "we used the fast spectrograph @xcite with the 600 line mm@xmath26 grating and a 1.5  slit , providing wavelength coverage 3500   to 5500   and a spectral resolution of 1.7  .",
    "all observations were paired with a comparison lamp exposure , and were flux - calibrated using blue spectrophotometric standards .",
    "the extracted spectra typically have a s / n of 10 per pixel in the continuum and a 18 km s@xmath26  radial velocity error .",
    "our follow - up observations provide improved stellar atmosphere constraints , from which we determine that 24 ( 42% ) of the candidates are probable elm wds with @xmath8 ( see figure [ fig : teff ] ) .",
    "the remaining candidates have either @xmath28 and are normal da wds , or @xmath29 and are presumably halo blue horizontal branch or blue straggler stars .",
    "figure [ fig : teff ] plots the distribution of @xmath14  vs.  @xmath23  for all of the wds with @xmath30 .",
    "previously published elm survey stars are marked with red circles .",
    "the observed wds overlap tracks based on @xcite models for he - core wds with hydrogen shell burning ( ( green lines ) * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but do not overlap main sequence nor horizontal branch evolutionary tracks . for reference , we also plot @xcite solar metallicity main sequence tracks for 2 , 3 , and 6 @xmath4  stars ( cyan lines ) .",
    "a helium - burning horizontal branch star can have a surface gravity similar to a degenerate he wd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but only at a systematically higher effective temperature than that targeted by the elm survey . this is illustrated by @xcite [ fe / h]=-1.48 horizontal branch tracks for 0.488 , 0.495 , and 0.500 @xmath4  stars ( magenta lines ) , as well as the homogenous helium - burning main sequence from @xcite .",
    "the zero - age main sequence and helium - burning horizontal branch isochrones ( thick lines ) mark the limits .",
    "seventeen of the wds show significant velocity variability , including twelve of the newly identified elm wds .",
    "the other elm wds have insufficient coverage for detecting ( or ruling out ) velocity variability .",
    "we focus the remainder of this paper on the 17 well - constrained systems .",
    "our sample of 17 well - constrained systems contains four @xmath23  @xmath31 objects , objects at the edge of our stellar atmosphere grid that might not be considered degenerate wds if not for their observed orbital motion .",
    "we also fit these stars to grids of @xcite models spanning @xmath32 } \\le 0.5 $ ] , @xmath33 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but found very poor solutions .",
    "this motivated us to perform a new set of stellar atmosphere fits using @xcite hydrogen model atmospheres .",
    "the gianninas models employ improved stark broadening profiles @xcite , and the ml2/@xmath34 = 0.8 prescription of the mixing - length theory for models where convective energy transport is important @xcite .",
    "we calculate atmosphere models for low surface gravities , and use a grid that covers @xmath14  from 4000 k to 30,000 k in steps ranging from 250 to 5000 k and @xmath23  from 5.0 to 8.0 in steps of 0.25 dex .",

    "this is in stark contrast to the population of 0.4 @xmath4 wds in the solar neighborhood , of which 20%-30% are single @xcite .",
    "one of the most exciting aspects of our elm wd binaries is that many have gravitational wave merger times less than a hubble time , and in one case as short as 1 myr @xcite .",
    "a natural question , then , is what will happen when the wds merge .",
    "notably , 5 of our 17 new binaries have probable system masses ( for @xmath178 ) in excess of a chandrasekhar mass .    figure [ fig : merge ] plots the distribution of merger time and system mass for the elm survey binaries assuming @xmath178 , except when inclination is known .",
    "the majority of our binaries have probable masses below the chandrasekhar mass and are not potential supernova type ia progenitors , but six systems appear to have either neutron star or massive wd companions .",

    "the chandrasekhar mass systems generally have extreme @xmath207 and so will evolve into stable mass transfer am cvn systems . if the accretors are massive wds , these systems should experience a large helium flash that may appear as an underluminous .ia supernova ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also possible that the helium flash will detonate the massive wd in a double - detonation scenario @xcite .",
    "the chandrasekhar mass systems are thus potential supernovae progenitors .",
    "however , the outcome of a merger of an elm wd with a massive wd is uncertain ( see * ? ? ?",
    "systems with @xmath208 , such as j2338@xmath352052 , will experience unstable mass transfer .",
    "these systems may merge @xcite to form a single low - mass wd , r crb star , or helium - burning sdb star .",
    "systems with intermediate @xmath209 , such as j0651 + 2844 , will experience either stable or unstable mass transfer depending on their spin - orbit coupling . after we constrain the remaining elm wd candidates plotted in fig.[fig : teff ] we look forward to calculating their space density and merger rate .",
    "elm wds binaries are clearly an important channel for am cvn star formation , and thus an important source of strong gravitational waves in the mhz regime .",
    "we perform stellar atmosphere fits to the entire collection of single - epoch spectra in the hvs survey and identify 57 new low mass wd candidates .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy reveals 17 wds with significant velocity variability , 12 of which are elm wds .",
    "presently , the elm survey sample is consistent with all of the elm wds being part of close binaries .",
    "elm wds are thus signposts for binaries that are strong gravitational wave sources and possible supernovae progenitors .",
    "four binaries in our sample contain @xmath1 objects , objects that might not be considered wds or proto - wds if not for their observed orbital motion .",
    "the existence of @xmath1 wds motivates us to develop a new set of stellar atmosphere models following @xcite .",
    "interestingly , all of the lowest surface gravity ( @xmath164 ) wds in our sample have metal lines in their spectra .",
    "this issue will be studied in detail in a future paper ; infrared observations are needed to constrain the possibility of debris disks as the source of ca and mg accretion in these compact binary systems .",
    "recent discoveries of pulsations in several of our elm wd targets @xcite enable us to probe the interiors of low - mass , presumably he - core wds using the tools of asteroseismology .",
    "due to the hvs color selection , all of the newly identified systems are hotter than 10,000 k and therefore too hot to show the g - mode pulsations detected in cooler elm wds @xcite .",
    "four binaries in our sample have massive @xmath30.9 @xmath4  companions and @xmath210 gyr merger times",
    ". if the unseen companions are massive wds , these extreme mass ratio binaries will undergo stable mass transfer and will evolve into am cvn systems and potentially future .ia or underluminous supernovae .",
    "thus the systems j0751@xmath350141 , j1141 + 3850 , j1238 + 1946 , and j2132 + 0754 are possible supernova progenitors .",
    "the other possibility is that the massive companions in these four binaries are neutron stars . given their past common envelope evolution , the systems quite possibly contain milli - second pulsars . a fifth system , j0811 + 0225 , appears to have a minimum companion mass close to a chandrasekhar mass .",
    "we are conducting follow - up optical , radio , and x - ray observations to establish the nature of these extreme mass ratio elm wd binaries .",
    "optically visible wd companions of neutron stars are useful for constraining the binary mass ratio and also to calibrate the spin - down ages of milli - second pulsars .    given our present observations , we expect that the elm survey will grow to 100 binaries in a few years .",
    "a large sample is important for finding more systems like j0651 + 2844 , a 12.75 min period system that provides us with a laboratory for measuring the spin - orbit coupling and tidal heating of a rapidly merging pair of wds .",
    "we expect that photometric observations will discover more pulsating elm wds",
