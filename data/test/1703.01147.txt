    "when the radial variable @xmath18 is of the order of the inverse interaction range @xmath13 or larger , universality breaks down and the states become sensitive to the details of the interaction at short distances .",
    "ultracold atoms are an ideal tool to study such phenomena since the scattering length can be tuned experimentally to be large compared to the range of the interaction using feshbach resonances .",
    "efimov trimers can be observed in ultracold atomic gases via their signature in three - body recombination rates @xcite . using this method , kraemer _ et al . _",
    "provided the first evidence for efimov trimers in an ultracold gas of @xmath19cs atoms by observing the resonant enhancement of atom losses through three - body recombination caused by the trimers @xcite .",
    "efimov states have been observed in a variety of other atomic species since then @xcite .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath20 can be significantly reduced in heteronuclear systems with different mass particles which makes it easier to observe multiple states . in this paper , we focus on heteronuclear systems with two species of atoms where only the interspecies scattering length is large . for comparable masses",
    "the scaling factor is quite large in this case ( @xmath21 for equal masses ) as we now have only two resonant interactions out of three .",
    "however , in the case of two heavy bosonic atoms of mass @xmath1 ( denoted @xmath22 ) and one light atom of mass @xmath23 ( denoted @xmath24 ) , this factor can become significantly smaller than the value 22.7 for identical bosons  @xcite .",
    "relaxation and recombination losses near an interspecies resonance have recently been investigated in mixtures of cesium and lithium atoms and three consecutive cs - cs - li efimov resonances were observed in agreement with the predicted scaling relations @xcite .",
    "the effect of the cs - cs scattering length on the efimov resonances was investigated in refs .",

    "connected to the efimov states are universal bound states in the four- and higher - body sector .",
    "although there is no accumulation of bound states at threshold , there are universal four- and higher - body states attached to each efimov trimer .",

    "the ground states have been calculated up to @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to demonstrate the existence of the higher - body universal states in experiments with mixtures .",
    "focusing on four - body states , the @xmath28 states are most promising due to the favorable scaling factor .",
    "however , the relation of the higher - body energies to the trimer energies is not governed by the same universal numbers and even the number of higher - body states attached to the trimers will very likely depend on the mass ratio .",
    "the signatures of efimov physics in heteronuclear four - body systems were first investigated in ref .",
    "a detailed study of the four - body states in a mixture of cesium and lithium atoms in the vicinity of the unitary limit and the three - atom threshold was recently performed by blume and yan @xcite . for large enough mass ratios ( @xmath29 they found two universal four - body states in the unitary limit .",
    "they also found an excited four - body state for negative values of the scattering length for all mass ratios they investigated ( @xmath30 ) . for the mass ratio @xmath31",
    "they showed that the excited tetramer becomes unbound at a certain positive value of the scattering length , leading them to the conjecture that the scattering length at which the excited tetramer becomes unbound depends on the mass ratio .    in this paper",
    ", we build upon the investigation by blume and yan and extend it in several ways .",
    "we extend their calculation to positive scattering lengths further away from the unitary limit .",
    "in particular , we investigate the mass dependence of the spectrum and discuss the number of universal tetramer states as function of the mass ratio .",
    "one of our key findings is that the structure of the spectrum changes as the mass ratio @xmath2 decreases . in particular ,",
    "the distance between the thresholds for trimer and tetramer states gets smaller until they almost coincide for @xmath32 .",
    "preliminary studies of this aspect were presented in ref .",
    "moreover , we summarize our insights in a multi - dimensional efimov plot which shows @xmath12 as a function of @xmath11 and the ratio of the heavy and light masses @xmath2 .    a particularly interesting aspect of the @xmath28 system is the prospect of observing effective efimov states of a @xmath33 dimer and two heavy atoms @xmath22 which are denoted @xmath34 in the following .",
    "such an effective efimov effect must exist close to the crossing point of the @xmath35 trimer and the @xmath33 dimer threshold .",

    "@xcite found evidence for the existence of two such states for the mass ratio @xmath37 with a scaling factor of approximately 20 .",
    "they explain the small scaling factor with an effective interaction between the @xmath22 particles that is induced by the exchange of the @xmath24 particle . in this paper",

    "first , the gem calculations could be not as accurate as we estimate , possibly due to neglected higher partial wave contributions or hard to detect numerical pathologies .",
    "second , some essential aspect of the system might not be present in the effective three - body description , which might also explain why different approximation schemes yield different results as discussed in the next section .",
    "to discuss the effective efimov states that were already mentioned in the introduction , three aspects are important . to begin with , the region where they can occur has to be established . for discussions on whether or not they can be seen in numerical calculations or even in experiments , an important issue is the predicted scaling factor .",
    "we will briefly present two competing approximation schemes that lead to very different predictions . to conclude",
    ", we will comment on the current state of the evidence for the effective efimov states .      near the dimer threshold ,",
    "both trimer and tetramer become very weakly bound in comparison to the dimer . for this reason",
    "it is expected that at a certain point the system can be treated as an effective three - body problem . at the point were the trimer becomes unbound , the dimer - atom interaction is resonant , leading to the occurrence of the efimov effect in the effective three - body system .",
    "therefore , the effective efimov effect is expected to arise in a small region around the point where the trimer crosses the dimer threshold .",
    "this region is bounded by the tetramer ground state from below . as we have shown in the previous section , this region",
    "( the size of which can be expressed by @xmath139 ) proved to be extremely small in our calculations .",
    "the effective efimov effect has already been studied in systems of four identical bosons by deltuva @xcite and in heteronuclear systems by wang et al .",
    "@xcite .    for four identical bosons , deltuva found @xmath140 , which compares well to our value for @xmath141li/@xmath120li , @xmath142 . for equal masses ,",
    "our effective three - body calculations yielded values between @xmath143 and @xmath144 , depending on the three - body parameter ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : thresh ] and the discussion in the previous section ) .",
    "assuming that the system is away from the unitary limit and close to the dimer threshold the dimer - atom scattering length is much larger than the scattering length between identical bosons , which means that the system studied in @xcite is comparable to our calculations .",
    "deltuva also did effective three - body dimer - atom - atom calculations and showed that very close to the dimer - atom - atom threshold this approximation is valid .",
    "his estimated scaling factor for the effective efimov states is @xmath145 , which agrees with @xcite and our discussion in the next section .    in a paper from 2012 ,",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite used the born - oppenheimer approximation in heteronuclear systems with very high mass ratios ( @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) to calculate recombination features .",
    "they calculated trimer ( @xmath38 ) , tetramer ( @xmath148 ) and also @xmath34 states as effective two- and three - body problems .",
    "they also used correlated gaussian results to check their calculations where possible .",
    "moreover , they provide a qualitative sketch of the heteronuclear efimov spectrum .",
    "we note , however , that this sketch is somewhat misleading concerning the window where dimer - atom - atom efimov states could form , as its size is exaggerated in light of our results . comparing their results to ours , several differences can be noted .    from fig .  2 in  @xcite we extracted their @xmath139 for @xmath149 , which is roughly @xmath150 , an order of magnitude larger than for our calculations ( extrapolations via the effective three - body calculations to @xmath146 suggest something of order @xmath151 ) .",
    "@xcite , separable potentials of yamaguchi type between the @xmath33 pairs were used @xcite .",
    "so there are three obvious possible reasons for the discrepancy , a ) @xmath139 is not universal and in fact depends on the @xmath33 potential , b ) the bo approximation is problematic in this region , as may be suggested by the fact that the scaling factor between consecutive efimov states is 5.5 in their calculations , while the universal value is 3.96  @xcite , and c ) the effective three - body calculations we used are not valid for higher mass ratios because of the larger @xmath139 value , and therefore the extrapolation to @xmath149 is not sound .    to rule out a )",
    ", one would have to use a different potential and redo the calculations .",
    "moreover , it is unclear whether the calculations of wang et al .",
    "@xcite are conducted closer to the unitary limit than ours , but since they state that @xmath152 is not well satisfied in their calculations , we suppose @xmath153 is of comparable size for both their calculations and ours ( we have @xmath154 for the ( @xmath155 ) and ( @xmath156 ) systems , and @xmath157 for the ( @xmath158 ) system ) .",
    "in addition , because @xmath139 is very similar for the excited and ground state trimer in their calculation , and of roughly the same order of magnitude for different values of @xmath153 in our calculations , a strong dependence on @xmath153 is not likely .    following the argument b ) , one might also add that our effective three - body calculation did not agree too well with our full four - body calculation , as shown in the previous section .",
    "( note that the order of magnitude of @xmath139 is a fit parameter in our stm treatment , so it agrees by construction . ) this might indicate that approximations that reduce the problem to an effective three - body system are generally insufficient to accurately describe the behavior near the dimer threshold .",
    "aspect c ) should not play a huge role because the atom - dimer scattering length @xmath159 is estimated to be larger than @xmath160 for @xmath161 and does not change much between @xmath162 and @xmath163 , so extrapolating to @xmath146 should yield reasonable accuracy .",
    "the dimer - atom - atom efimov effect is conjectured to arise when the four - body system of @xmath148 can be treated as an effective three - body system that has an effective resonant interaction .",
    "this is expected to be the case in the vicinity where the @xmath38 three - body state vanishes into the dimer threshold . there ,",
    "braaten and hammer @xcite argued , we can regard the @xmath33 dimer as much more strongly bound than the trimer , allowing us to treat the trimer as an effective two - body system @xmath164 with an effective @xmath165 scattering length @xmath159 which can be estimated by the inverse square root of the binding energy of the @xmath38 trimer .",
    "then the @xmath148 tetramer can be treated as an effective three - body system @xmath34 which is also governed by the dimer - atom scattering length @xmath159 . for large @xmath159",
    "this leads to the emergence of the efimov effect .",
    "the scaling factor expected in this case is roughly 2000 , because there are only two interacting pairs @xmath165 , and there are two `` light '' particles @xmath22 and one that is slightly heavier @xmath166 .",
    "the scenario with the smallest scaling factor is @xmath167 , in which case it is 1986.1 @xcite .",
    "this is the picture we have been using in our stm calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thresh ] . because of the huge scaling factor , we did not expect to be able to find these efimov states with the accuracy we have reached .",
    "however , in the born - oppenheimer approximation picture that wang et al .",
    "@xcite used , the light atom @xmath24 is seen as mediating the interaction between the heavy bosons @xmath22 , leading to an effective three - body problem of three @xmath22 s , with an effective scattering length @xmath168 .",
    "this effective scattering length diverges for the values of @xmath169 where an efimov trimer becomes unbound , so it shows the same behavior as @xmath159 .",
    "but , since in this picture the @xmath24 is absorbed in the effective interaction , a symmetric system of three resonantly interacting @xmath22 s emerges .",
    "the efimov effect for this system , which is the well known three identical boson case , yields a much smaller scaling factor of @xmath170 @xcite .    using the born - oppenheimer approximation , wang et al .",
    "@xcite find somewhat tenuous evidence for an excited tetramer separated from the lower tetramer by a scaling factor of @xmath171 on the positive @xmath168 side and @xmath172 on the negative side .",
    "this is in disagreement with the expectation from the eft approach outlined above .",
    "the main difference between the two approaches lies in the way the separation of scales is conducted . in the first approach",
    ", it is assumed that the @xmath33 dimer is much more deeply bound than the @xmath38 and @xmath148 states , allowing a separation of energy scales and associated length scales .",
    "this assumption is found to be valid , because @xmath173 for the whole region shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:133 - 6 ]  and [ fig:87 - 7 ] .",
    "on the other hand , in the bo approximation it is assumed that the time scale of the motion of the light atom is much shorter than that of the heavy atoms , allowing us to solve the dynamics of the light atom for fixed heavy atoms and then solving the heavy atoms system independently .",
    "this assumes that the light atom interacts with all the heavy atoms while they are fixed at some points , thus generating an effective interaction .",
    "if however the light atom is very tightly bound to one heavy atom , as is the case here , its motion around the heavy atom might be on a shorter timescale than the motion of the heavy atom , but its motion towards the other heavy atoms is coupled to the motion of the heavy atom , which means it is on the same timescale and therefore not separable . by using the bo approximation one implies in the calculation that the dimer is not very deeply bound .",
    "this means that in our understanding , both effective treatments are mutually exclusive and have to be applied to different systems . if we regard the two approximations as two ends of a spectrum , the bo approximation would apply to the case where the dimer and the trimer are both very weakly bound , and the eft approximation would apply to the case where the dimer is infinitely strongly bound . between these two points , we conjecture there is a transition between the three identical boson case with its relatively small scaling factor which then becomes larger and larger until it reaches the limit of two light bosons with one heavy boson . for the case we are studying here",
    ", this could mean that the scaling factor is slightly smaller than we would expect from our stm calculation .",
    "this however can only be explored using a full four - body calculation that is accurate enough to resolve these effective efimov states .      to estimate whether it would be possible to see the effective efimov states in our calculations , we made some further assumptions . first , we assumed that the universal tetramer can be interpreted at the same time as the lowest state of the effective efimov states .",
    "we do not expect this state to be fully universal , so the scaling factor between this state and the next may be smaller or larger , but we expect it to be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this assumption was apparently also made by wang et al .",
    "@xcite , although they did not mention it explicitly .",
    "the second assumption is that the shape of the first excited effective efimov state would resemble the shape of the universal tetramer near the threshold .",
    "then we could scale the tetramer in figs .",
    "[ fig:133 - 6 ] and [ fig:87 - 7 ] using different scaling factors to assess whether this state could be found with our accuracy .",
    "an example for a scaling factor of 20 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:133 - 6 ] .",
    "our four - body calculations presented here are by far not accurate enough to find effective efimov states with a scaling factor of 2000 .",
    "but our accuracy might just be sufficient to detect effective efimov states if the scaling factor was indeed approximately 20 as suggested by wang et al .",
    "we did not find any states , but since they would be just at the limit of our resolution , this is no conclusive evidence of their non - existence .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a detailed study of the bound state spectrum of heteronuclear four - body systems of three heavy bosons @xmath22 and a light atom @xmath24 with resonant interspecies interaction in the region of positive scattering lengths .",
    "the interaction between the heavy bosons was assumed to be negligible . to obtain the energies of the @xmath38 trimer and @xmath28 tetramer systems , we employed the gaussian expansion method ( gem ) @xcite .",
    "the general structure of the spectrum for different mass ratios was summarized in the efimov plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] , a notable feature being that there is no excited efimov tetramer at all for the mass ratio @xmath114 . as the mass ratio increases ,",
    "the excited state tetramer appears on the negative scattering length side of the efimov plot .",
    "for @xmath31 it exists also in the unitary limit and disappears through the trimer - atom threshold on the positive scattering length side of the efimov plot .",
    "our results confirm and extend the findings of blume and yan  @xcite , who conducted calculations down to @xmath174 .",
    "next we focused on the dimer - atom(-atom ) threshold region .",
    "we found that the value of the scattering length where the trimer vanishes into the threshold and the point where the tetramer does the same are extremely close to each other .",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the distance between these points , @xmath135 , on the mass ratio @xmath2 and presented a detailed discussion of the sources of error in our calculation , such as a possible dependence of the results on the potential shape and missing higher partial wave contributions .",
    "we have estimated the size of errors from the latter to not be larger than @xmath104 near the dimer - atom - atom threshold .",
    "the correlation between @xmath135 and @xmath2 does not appear to be linear , and the results from the four - body calculation could be reconciled only partly with effective three - body results in the framework of a stm - like equation derived from effective field theory  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that either an important aspect of the four - body system is missing in the effective three - body calculation close to the dimer - atom - atom threshold , or the errors of our four - body results are underestimated .",
    "the resolution of this question requires further work , such as repeating the calculations for different potential shapes , to test the influence on @xmath135 and the general shape of the tetramer near the threshold . in order to rule out finite range effects a study of higher excited trimers and the tetramer resonances",
    "belonging to them would be useful .",
    "in the last part , we discussed in depth the possibility of finding effective dimer - atom - atom efimov states near the dimer - atom - atom threshold .",
    "we did not observe such states and estimated it is unlikely to find them without a major improvement of the accuracy in our calculation .",
    "wang and collaborators  @xcite have previously found such states , albeit only in effective three - body calculations within the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "we have compared our results to the results of  @xcite and highlighted some important differences between the two approaches .",
    "the key question in reconciling the results involves the scaling factor for the effective efimov states .",
    "we expect a large scaling factor of order 2000 since only the @xmath33 dimer and the @xmath22 atoms of the effective three - body system are interacting resonantly .",
    "we estimated that for this scaling factor an observation of the effective efimov states in our calculation is very unlikely . in the born - oppenheimer picture , however , the light @xmath24 atom mediates an interaction between all three @xmath22 atoms such that there are effectively three resonant pair interactions and the scaling factor should be much smaller and close to 22.7 . as we discussed in detail , it is not obvious that the born - oppenheimer picture is still applicable near the dimer - atom - atom threshold . settling the question of the effective dimer - atom - atom efimov states in heteronuclear systems requires a significant increase in the accuracy of our four - body calculations and a coordinated study of the problem in both approaches .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with doerte blume on heteronuclear few - body systems and practical units , and with artem volosniev on the limitations of the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "we also thank doerte blume for providing data from her figures from @xcite .",

    "thanks riken for support under the ipa program and the studienstiftung des deutschen volkes for support under the riken program .",
    "some of the calculations were carried out at supercomputing facilities of the yitp ( kyoto university ) and of nagoya university .",
    "an effective field theory for heteronuclear three - body systems consisting of an atom of mass @xmath175 and two identical bosonic atoms of mass @xmath176 was developed by helfrich et al .  @xcite .",
    "this effective field theory leads to an analog of the skorniakov - ter - martirosian ( stm ) equation  @xcite for the unequal mass case .",
    "similar equations also arise in the effective field theory description of two - neutron halo nuclei in nuclear physics  @xcite . here",
