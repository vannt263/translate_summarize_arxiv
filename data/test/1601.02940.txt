    "this device is limited by the signal to noise ratio of the diffraction pattern ( i.e. the object signal ) , which prevents the detection of particles less than 5 @xmath2 in diameter with a unitary magnification configuration . to improve accuracy , while keeping ease of use of the experimental set - up , one can consider optimizing both the experimental and the data processing design .    here",
