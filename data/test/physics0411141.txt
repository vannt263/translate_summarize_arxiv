    "the time delay between two dynamical systems can provide information on conduction velocity , and the nature and origin of coupling , between the processes . so it is necessary to use a well validated method for this purpose .",
    "literature on time delay is vast and well documented in @xcite .",
    "often , in physiological time series analysis , a single method can not be made unique to be applicable for a wide class of data stemming from the processes seemingly operated by similar mechanisms .",
    "methods used for time delay estimation are no exception from this fact . here",
    ", we use a spectral based method , maximising coherence , for the time delay estimation @xcite .",
    "first , we apply this method to uni- and bi - directionally coupled rssler attractors with a known delay between the systems . in both cases ,",
    "the results obtained are in good agreement within a narrow range of the delay used in the simulation .",
    "then , we apply this method to simultaneously recorded traces of electroencephalogram ( eeg ) and electromyogram ( emg ) of subjects with essential tremor a well known pathological form of hand tremor .",
    "we obtain a delay of 11 - 27 milli seconds ( @xmath0 ) between the tremor correlated cortical activity ( eeg ) and emg and the results are reasonably within the range of experimentally observed value for cortico - muscular transmission @xcite .",
    "this result , further confirms the involvement of cortex in the generation of essential tremor @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we discuss in detail , the methodology of coherence analysis .",
    "then , we extend the coherence analysis for time delay estimation . due to a time delay",
    "there will be a time misalignment between the two time series thereby causing a reduction in the coherence estimated between them . in order to compensate for the reduction in coherence due to delay , we shift one of the time series keeping the other constant and estimate the coherence as a function of the shift .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to estimate the time delay between the acoustic source and the receiving signals @xcite . on similar lines ,",
    "phase synchronisation is used to estimate the time delay between and among the atmospheric variables observed at different meteorological sites @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we apply this method to afore mentioned theoretical models . after validating the method by the results of standard models , in section 4",
    ", we apply this method to estimate the time delay between the simultaneously recorded eeg and emg data of essential tremor subjects .",
    "we discuss the results and conclude in section 5 .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be two simultaneously recorded data sets of length @xmath3 .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the two data sets are , respectively , set to zero and one .",
    "we divide the data sets into @xmath4 disjoint segments of length @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 .",
    "we calculate power spectra , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and cross spectrum @xmath9 , which is the fourier transform of the cross - correlation function of the signals @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite , in each segment . over cap in all the quantities",
    "indicates that it is an estimate of that quantity .",
    "finally , we average the power spectra and the cross - spectrum across all the segments and calculate coherence as follows @xcite , @xmath10 the coherence spectrum provides the strength of correlation between the two signals , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the confidence limit for coherence at the @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the coherence spectrum is always considered with this line . in all of our analysis , @xmath13 is set to 0.99 , and hence the confidence limit is @xmath14 .",
    "the estimated value of coherence , at a frequency , above this line indicates ( a ) significant coherence between the two time series at this frequency ; ( b ) the magnitude ( deviation of coherence from this line ) determines the degree of linear correlation between the two time series at this frequency .",
    "the estimated value of coherence at a frequency below this line is considered as the lack of correlation between the two time series at this frequency .",
    "if the sampling frequency of the signals is @xmath15 @xmath16 ( i.e. @xmath17 number of data points are sampled per second ) , then the frequency resolution of the quantities in eq .",
    "1 , is @xmath18 .",
    "thus , one should optimally choose the value of @xmath5 depending on the purpose of analysis , to compromise between the sensitivity and reliability .",
    "usage of the fixed segment length @xmath5 is questioned and a variable segment length is suggested in @xcite , to make quantitative assessment of the signal .",
    "but , for all practical purposes , a fixed segment length is easily implementable and hence , it is used in the forthcoming analysis .",
    "while the coherence spectrum provides the strength of correlation between the two signals @xmath1 and @xmath2 , time ( delay ) information between the two signals can be obtained from the phase spectrum , which is the argument of the cross - spectrum @xcite , @xmath19 following @xcite , eq .",
    "2 can be further simplified to see the explicit appearance of the time delay in it as follows , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the time delay .",
    "the phase estimate @xmath22 and its upper and lower 95% confidence interval are given by @xcite @xmath23^\\frac12 .",
    "\\eqno 4\\ ] ] thus , the confidence interval of the phase estimate is inversely related to coherence . in the rest of the paper we use estimates of the coherence and phase without the over hat for the sake of convenience .",
    "one of the conventional ways to estimate a time delay , in frequency domain , is to fit a straight line to the phase spectrum ( eq .",
    "3 ) in the frequency band of significant coherence , as the phase can be reliably estimated only in the frequency band of significant coherence ( see eq .",
    "this method of estimating delay is possible when we have a broad band coherence and limits its applicability to the narrow band coherent signals . in some cases",
    ", coherence extends to first harmonic and hence the phase values at the harmonics are used to increase the reliability of the delay estimate @xcite .",
    "further , if two time series show significant coherence over a wide range of frequency band , but have a minimal phase relation , then the estimation of time delay from the phase estimate is not straight forward . under such conditions , phase estimate , in addition to the @xmath24 term ( see eq .",
    "3 ) , will also contain a frequency dependent factor , namely , the argument of the transfer function , @xmath25 .",
    "in such cases , @xmath26 is estimated by hilbert transform , and then delay is estimated from the phase estimate after subtracting the estimated transfer function from the phase estimate @xcite . from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that phase estimates can not be used to estimate the delay from narrow band coherent signals which are often observed in human physiological data @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "we use the method of maximising coherence .    as discussed in the last part of the introduction",
    ", a delay @xmath21 between two time series , will cause a reduction in the estimated coherence between them . in order to compensate for the reduction in coherence due to delay and thereby to estimate the delay ,",
    "we realign the time series by artificially shifting them . for this , we shift one of the time series by a lag @xmath27 keeping the other constant and consider coherence at the selected frequency band @xmath28 as a function of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and repeat the same for the other time series . if there is a delay between the two time series , coherence in the selected frequency band @xmath30 will increase from its value at @xmath31 and reach a maximum at the @xmath29 corresponding to @xmath21 . after shifting one of the time series by a lag @xmath29",
    ", the length of the shifted time series will be less than the un - shifted time series by @xmath32 ( @xmath29 in sample units ) data points .",
    "we discard the extra data points in the un - shifted time series to have the same length for both time series .",
    "further , coherence is a relative measure and changes with the length of the data .",
    "it is reflected in the 99% confidence level ( see above ) .",
    "for each shift , we discard the points corresponding to the maximum lag from the entire length of the time series , and consider only the length of the data which is integer multiple of @xmath5 . by doing so , coherence",
    "@xmath30 calculated for all the lags will have the same confidence level , thereby confirming that the maximum value of coherence is reached only because of the delay and not due to the spurious effects caused in estimating coherence for different lengths of data . as we have confidence level as a check for the reliability of @xmath21 , we do nt need any additional tests like , surrogate tests @xcite to assess the reliability of the results .",
    "however , in order to get the variability in the estimated delay , we use surrogate analysis .",
    "surrogate analysis is introduced in the context of nonlinear time series analysis to check whether or not the time series under consideration has got a nonlinear structure @xcite . making the ( null ) hypothesis that the time series has come from a linear process , several linear realizations of the time series namely ,",
    "surrogates , are synthesised .",
    "then , the original time series and the surrogates are quantified by a suitable discriminating statistic .",
    "any deviation in the discriminating statistic calculated for the original time series and surrogates indicates the presence of nonlinear structure in the original time series and thereby rejecting the null hypothesis @xcite .",
    "there are different ways of preparing the surrogates @xcite .",
    "the misconception of surrogate analysis is discussed in @xcite . as mentioned above , the objective of the methods to generate surrogates @xcite is to synthesise a new data set by destroying the nonlinear structure present in the original data set .",
    "but our aim is not to show the presence of nonlinear structure in our data .",
    "for the purpose of calculating the error - bars of delay , surrogates are generated by exploiting one of the basic assumptions of spectral analysis that distinct parts of the time series are independent @xcite .",
    "instead of shuffling the time series as a whole ( which is done in one of the methods to synthesise surrogates , amplitude adjusted surrogates ) we shuffle the disjoint data segments from which the original spectrum is estimated ( see above ) .",
    "we shuffle only the un - shifted time series ( see above ) from which the information is assumed to flow to the other time series ( which is time shifted in advance in maximising coherence analysis ) with a delay . by doing so , the spectra of both the time series , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in eq",
    ". 1 will remain the same but the cross spectrum @xmath35 in eq .",
    "1 will be different .",
    "this type of surrogate is similar to the one proposed in @xcite where the whole time series is shuffled but by preserving two point correlation ( i.e. power spectrum ) of the original time series .",
    "for all the analyses reported in this paper we synthesise 19 different realizations of surrogates .",
    "we make a null hypothesis that @xmath30 obtained is due to spurious correlations between the two time series . for each realization of surrogate",
    "we calculate time delayed coherence @xmath36 .",
    "we calculate the significance of difference @xmath37 between the @xmath36 calculated for surrogates and @xmath30 where @xmath38}$ ] , where @xmath39 indicates the average over different realizations of surrogates and @xmath40 $ ] indicates the standard deviation between different realizations of surrogates .",
    "any value of @xmath41 indicates that the @xmath30 obtained is not due to spurious correlations @xcite and hence the null hypothesis is rejected .",
    "if the null hypothesis is rejected we consider @xmath30 for further analysis otherwise we discard it as spurious correlation .",
    "for the @xmath30 qualified in the surrogate analysis ( for which null hypothesis is rejected ) we calculate the error in the delay in the following way : we subtract @xmath36 calculated for each realization from @xmath30 and calculate delay for each subtracted function ( i.e. ) @xmath42 .",
    "we report here the delay of the system as the mean value of the delays ( calculated for the 19 surrogate subtracted realizations ) and their standard deviation as error - bar . as the increase in the @xmath30 when compensated for the delay",
    "is very small , for the sake of clarity we plot @xmath43 -\\left[c(\\omega_0)-<c(\\omega_0)^{surr}>\\right]$ ] .",

    "phase estimate of this system is given in fig .",
    "6c with @xmath92 confidence interval as error - bars .",
    "it is clear from fig . 6c",
    "that phase can be reliably estimated at the ( tremor and the significant coherence ) frequency of 5 @xmath16 ( confidence interval is narrow ) and also in the frequency band of 10 - 15 @xmath16 . in an earlier study _ hellwig et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated time delays based on the value of the phase estimate @xmath22 at the * tremor frequency*. but the results obtained @xcite are not in the interpretable level .",
    "the reason postulated in @xcite that the delay might be modulated by frequency dependent mechanism is hardly conceivable in a narrow ( single ) frequency band at which phase estimate is significant .",
    "the reason may be due to the weak assumption of the model @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the indispensable constant @xcite , phase shift between the two processes which is ignored in @xcite .",
    "however , we show below that the delay estimated by maximising coherence is reasonably in good agreement with the experimentally observed conduction velocity and is in physiologically interpretable range .",
    "application of the maximising coherence method to real life data like eeg is not straight forward .",
    "since the maximising coherence method is aimed at to capture the time delay ( by making up for the reduction in the coherence ) by artificially shifting ( local dynamics ) the time series , it is very sensitive to non - stationarities in the time series .",
    "however , in order to make coherence analysis robust against non - stationarities within the time series , we use the following way to discard the non - stationary parts of the data : we calculate autocorrelation function @xcite , in each of the segments ( of length 1000 samples ) . then the de - correlation time , time",
    "at which autocorrelation function falls to @xmath95 ( as the first value of autocorrelation function is 1 by definition ) @xcite is calculated for all the segments .",
    "non - stationarities due to base line shift , eye blinks will introduce artificial trends ( lifting up of the mean value of the signal ) @xcite in the signal , which will have higher de - correlation time than the stationary parts of the signal . in order to discard the non - stationary parts ,",
    "about 50 % of the median of the de - correlation time calculated in all the segments is taken as threshold and parts of the eeg and emg data with de - correlation time greater than the above defined threshold are discarded in the delay estimation .",
    "after discarding the non - stationary parts of the data , the segments left out on either side of the removed parts are stitched as if they are recorded continously .",
    "of course , care should be taken in applying the above method .",
    "the above method will capture only the non - stationary parts if it is applied to the data of low signal to noise ratio which can be avoided by visual inspection of the data .",

    "error - bars are obtained by surrogate analysis as discussed in the methodology section . a zero delay for cp4 ( see fig .",
    "8d ) may be due to the nullification of two strong counter acting forces ( drive from pmc to muscle and opposing drive from muscle to pmc , a situation similar to phase locking in coupled oscillators ) .",
    "the positive values of estimated delays including the error - bars are well in agreement with the experimentally observed value of 15 @xmath0 for forearm muscles @xcite . for the negative delay ( flow from muscle to eeg ) , it is at least partly in keeping with normal median somatosensory evoked potential ( sep ) latencies of around 20 @xmath0 .",
    "further , in order to make the delay statistically significant we report the delay of the hot spot as a whole as the delay of the system , by weighting the delay obtained for each electrode ( when it is qualified in surrogate analysis ) by a fraction of the coherence @xmath44 value that each electrode contributes to the hot spot . by doing so , electrodes showing higher tremor related correlations will contribute more to the delay of the system . for subject 1 , there is a hot spot ( central hot spot ) in the pmc region of scalp and another in the frontal region of the scalp ( i.e. ) fcz ( see fig .",
    "7b ) . of the electrodes contributing to the central hot spot",
    ", we do not consider c2 and c6 ( as they do not qualify in the surrogate analysis ) for further analysis .",
    "we weight the delay obtained for rest of the electrodes contributing to the central hot spot by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the number of electrodes contributing to hot spot after qualifying the surrogate analysis , and @xmath106 $ ] % is the contribution of the @xmath107th electrode to the hot spot ( it is easy to check that @xmath108 ) . similarly @xmath109 is calculated for each hot spot .",
    "further , in the calculation of @xmath109 for positive delay , only those electrodes which display positive delay are considered and similarly for negative delay , only those electrodes which display negative delay are considered . for subject 1 ,",
    "only one electrode , fcz contributes to the frontal hot spot , for which @xmath110 .",
    "we have normalised the error - bars of the delays in a similar way .",
    "the final values of delay for both the hot spots are given in table 1 along with the delay values obtained by maximising coherence analysis for four other subjects .",
    ".summary of delay estimation by maximising coherence for five essential tremor subjects .",
    "positive and negative signs are introduced in maximising coherence analysis just to denote the directions of information flow and have got no real life significance . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     of the five subjects considered three show an additional hot spot in the frontal region the delay values of which are also given in table 1 ( see third column ) .",
    "as can be seen there is also a cortico - muscular delay between the frontal hot spot and the periphery in all three cases .",
    "however , this delay is about double the cortico - muscular delay from the central hot spot .",
    "these results indicate that both the central area most likely corresponding to the primary sensorimotor cortex and more frontal area are involved in the generation of essential tremor .",
    "while the delays from the central area ( pmc ) between 11 and 16 @xmath0 are in keeping with a direct transmission through fast conducting pyramidal pathways @xcite the cortico - muscular delay from the more frontal area rather indicates another way of interaction with the periphery .",
    "thus the method of maximising coherence is capable of distinguishing different types of cortico - muscular interactions which are relevant to the understanding of the pathophysiology of essential tremor , for details see @xcite .",
    "the musculo - cortical delays partly agree but are generally slightly lower than the somatosensory conduction delays known from routine sep studies and most likely reflect feed back of the peripheral tremor to the cortex .",
    "we have used the method of maximising coherence to obtain the time delay between two series . as a test case",
    ", we applied this method to uni- and bi - directionally coupled rssler attractors . in both cases ,",
    "the delays estimated by maximising coherence match well with the expected values , within the error limits which are obtained by surrogate analysis .",
    "for eeg - emg time series of essential tremor subjects , this method yields a delay in the range of 11 to 16 @xmath0 for the primary sensorimotor area and 23 - 27 @xmath0 for the more frontal area involved in the tremor oscillation whereas the experimentally observed value of the conduction time between primary cortex and muscle is 15 @xmath98 2 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the larger delay observed for the frontal area may indicate a different , possibly indirect interaction with the periphery .",
    "the musculo - cortical delays ( 9 to 24 @xmath0 ) are partly in keeping with the delay observed ( around 20 @xmath0 ) in sep studies .",
    "one of the reasons for the slight deviation of the delay from experimentally observed value may be as follows : we have employed maximising coherence method to capture the delay between two series , assuming that there will be a continuous delayed flow of information from one time series to another .",
    "but , it may not be the case in biological data like eeg and emg . intermittently the flow may be absent .",
    "one way to check out this is to divide the time series into small sub - portions and calculate the time delay in each portion .",
    "but coherence analysis needs at least a minimum of 30000 data points to decide statistically whether or not the two time series under study are linearly correlated .",
    "so we need to analyse the nature of information flows using the nonlinear methods like extended granger causality @xcite , transfer entropy @xcite .",
    "this issue will be addressed in our future work .",
    "of course other methods like cross - correlation analysis and time delayed phase synchronisation analysis @xcite can be used to estimate the delay between the eeg and emg of the essential tremor subjects .",
    "but the problems in using cross - correlation are addressed in @xcite and references therein .",
    "there exists an analytical expression for the confidence limit for coherence estimate but this is lacking for phase synchronisation used in @xcite .",
    "that is the reason why phase synchronisation is not commonly used for correlation analysis ( subsequently for delay analysis in this work ) though this method is expected to be superior to coherence analysis @xcite .",
    "however comparison of the different methods of delay estimation is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
