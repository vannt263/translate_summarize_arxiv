    "the tunability in size , shape , and electron number of semiconductor quantum dots ( qd ) provides numerous technological applications as well as interesting many - electron physics .",
    "@xcite in actual qd devices , the effects induced by impurities or donor scattering centers may be remarkable . in most cases , irregularities in samples",

    "a clean quantum dot typically shows single - electron energy levels reminiscent of the well - known fock - darwin ( fd ) energy spectrum corresponding to a parabolic confining potential .",
    "@xcite adding external impurities into the qd breaks the circular symmetry of the system , leading to avoided crossings and liftings of the degeneracies in the single - electron energy spectrum .",
    "this was demonstrated by halonen  _ et al .",
    "_ ,  @xcite who studied theoretically qd s distorted by repulsive gaussian scattering centers .",
    "however , even if clear traces of the fd spectrum have been obtained experimentally in both lateral  @xcite and vertical  @xcite quantum dots , there is , to the best of our knowledge , no direct experimental evidence of repulsive impurities present in qd structures .",
    "instead , states bound to hydrogenic impurities , probably arising from si dopant atoms in the gaas quantum well , were found already by ashoori and co - workers  @xcite in their pioneering single - electron tunneling experiment .",
    "these impurities have been suggested to be sources of pair - tunneling states , theoretically analyzed with a superimposed attractive @xmath0-type potential .",
    "@xcite    theoretically , the distortion of the circular symmetry makes the many - electron problem particularly complex to solve , especially in the presence of an external magnetic field . in the above - mentioned study , halonen  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite applied exact diagonalization up to three electrons and focused on the effects of impurities on the energy levels and optical absorption spectra .",
    "recently , gl and co - workers  @xcite performed diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations on qd s distorted by randomly distributed gaussian scatterers and studied the energetics up to ten electrons .",
    "they found that in these systems the transitions between the many - body states are considerably less pronounced than in clean dots .",
    "hirose and wingreen  @xcite have used the spin - density - functional theory ( sdft ) to examine the energies and spin states in disordered qd s as a function of the interaction strength in zero magnetic field . besides additional scatterers ,",
    "non - circular qd s have attracted general interest in connection with the chaotic properties  @xcite or the behavior in the high magnetic field limit .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we present a measured single - electron transport spectrum where avoided crossings and lifted degeneracies are clearly observable .",
    "we reproduce the spectrum with an appropriate model potential , showing that the unexpected effects in the spectrum result from a negatively charged coulombic impurity located near the qd .",
    "the many - electron properties studied by the sdft reflect the strongly distorted single - electron spectrum .",
    "the variation of the impurity location shows the stability of the maximum - density droplet ( mdd ) and the screening of the impurity by electrons .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we briefly describe the fabrication of the sample and report the transport measurement . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the theoretical model describing the physical system is given and the single - electron calculations are compared to the experiment . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] the many - electron properties , i.e. , chemical potentials , mdd stability , and total magnetization are studied with the sdft .",
    "the paper is summarized in sec .",
    "the heterostructure consists of a 10  nm wide gaas quantum well sandwiched between two al@xmath1ga@xmath2as - tunneling barriers of @xmath3 and @xmath4  nm , see fig .",
    "[ sample ] .",
    "the contacts are formed by @xmath5  @xmath6 m thick gaas layers highly doped with si up to @xmath7  @xmath8 and separated from the active region by 7  nm thin spacer layers of undoped gaas .",
    "our sample was defined as a mesa of 40  @xmath6 m size .",
    "we carried out direct - current measurements of the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics in a he@xmath9-refrigerator at 350  mk base temperature in magnetic fields up to @xmath10  t.    figure  [ exp_spectrum ]    t.,width=321 ]    shows the resulting transport spectrum of a quantum dot formed in a local potential minimum .",
    "the black lines @xmath11 correspond to high differential conductance @xmath12 .",
    "they trace the position of the single - electron energy states @xmath13 of the spectrum according to a relation @xmath14 where the energy - voltage conversion factor @xmath15 equals 0.4 , determined from measurements of the broadening of the step edge with temperature , and the onset voltage is fitted to be @xmath16  mv .",
    "the energy levels @xmath11 in the transport spectrum can be interpreted as single - particle levels of a local , presumably a grown - induced potential minimum in the gaas quantum well of our device .",
    "the lowest fd band is clearly visible , and one can also observe higher excited states .",
    "in contrast to ordinary fd energy levels , we are able to observe broken energy degeneracies at @xmath17  t and strong anticrossing effects in the spectrum .",
    "we expect the quantum well confined in the gaas layer to have a negligible degree of freedom for electrons in the vertical direction . our model system is thus strictly two - dimensional and defined to be located on the @xmath18 plane .",
    "the single - electron hamiltonian is written as @xmath19 ^ 2 + v_{\\rm conf}({\\mathbf r})+v_{\\rm imp}({\\mathbf r}),\\ ] ] where we use the effective - mass approximation with @xmath20 , which is the typical value for electrons moving in gaas . in a symmetric gauge",
    "the vector potential reads as @xmath21 , giving the external magnetic field @xmath22 perpendicular to the qd plane .",
    "the zeeman energy is omitted in eq .",
    "( [ hami1 ] ) since the spin splitting  @xcite is not visible in the energy levels shown in fig .",
    "[ exp_spectrum ] for the magnetic fields applied .",
    "the confining potential @xmath23 is expected to be parabolic near the center of the dot .",

    "we expect the impurity to be described by a negatively charged particle located in the vicinity of the quantum well . the impurity potential can thus be written in a coulombic form as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ( negative ) charge of the impurity particle",
    ", @xmath29 describes the `` dielectricity '' between the impurity and the electrons in the qd , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the lateral and vertical distances of the impurity from the qd center , respectively .",
    "figure  [ vex ] shows the total external confinement of the        model system , @xmath32 , and a sketch of the expected configuration .    to calculate the single - electron spectrum , we solve the discretized eigenvalue problem @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) numerically on a 2d point grid using a rayleigh quotient multigrid method .",

    "[ exp_spectrum ] ) .",
    "the energies are converted to voltages according to eq .",
    "( [ conv ] ) , and the model parameters are adjusted ( see the discussion below ) until the agreement between the experiment and the model is as good as possible . the simulation places the avoided crossings between the energy levels very close to the correct positions .",
    "there are still considerable deviations in the 5th and 6th levels but , for example , the 7th level agrees almost perfectly through the magnetic - field regime presented . the differences at high fields between the experimental data and the simulation result from the shift of the chemical potential of the emitter to higher energies with increasing magnetic field .",
    "in calculating the energy spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , we optimize the potential parameters corresponding to the best possible fit to the experimental data .",
    "the confinement is then defined by @xmath35 mev , @xmath36 nm , and @xmath37 , and the impurity parameters are given by @xmath38 , @xmath39 nm , and @xmath40 nm . there is naturally some uncertainty in the parameters .",
    "however , for this particular sample we find the following characteristic features in the model potential : ( i ) the @xmath29-reduced impurity charge is so large that it indicates a multiple charged particle distorting the qd .",
    "( ii ) the impurity is located very close to the qd plane , probably lying in the 10 nm thick gaas layer ( see fig .",
    "[ sample ] ) .",
    "( iii ) the confining potential is approximately three times larger than the values typically used ( @xmath41 mev ) for modeling parabolic qd s .",
    "this is due to the grown - induced formation of the qd in the absence of gates around the sample .",
    "( iv ) for the same reason , the confinement becomes softer toward the edges of the dot .",
    "hence , the rounding at @xmath42 in @xmath43 is required to compress the highest states in agreement with the experimental spectrum .    to clarify the sensitivity of the single - electron spectrum on the shape of the model potential , we compare in fig .",
    "[ single ]        the eigenenergies given by the chosen model ( thick lines ) to those of a model qd without the rounded edges ( thin lines ) and to those of a corresponding clean model dot without @xmath44 but with the rounding term ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the level repulsion is clearly induced by the coulombic impurity that breaks the circular symmetry of the qd and mixes the fd levels of different orbital quantum numbers .",
    "a statistical analysis of the energy - level spacings would enlighten the quantum chaotic properties  @xcite of the system but it is not included in this study . in the high - field limit , however , the system becomes integrable and the eigenstates condense into landau levels .",
    "the rounding term in @xmath43 has the strongest influence on the levels with the highest angular momenta , and the cusp at @xmath24 induces also a weak decoupling of the degeneracies at @xmath17 t. we remark that the eigenenergies for the clean case are lifted in fig .",
    "[ single ] by @xmath10 mev for clarity .",
    "the coulombic impurity in the vicinity of the qd thus has a strong effect on the eigenenergies .",
    "this tendency is also apparent in the many - electron properties studied below .",
    "next we study situations that the quantum dot described by the best fitting parameters above contains up to six interacting electrons .",
    "even if the many - electron case has not yet been experimentally realized for this particular qd , we find it important to predict how the increasing electron number changes the effects of the impurity on the ground - state properties .",
    "the problem is now described by the @xmath45-electron hamiltonian @xmath46 + + \\sum^n_{i < j}\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\epsilon|{\\mathbf r}_i-{\\mathbf r}_j| } , \\label{hami}\\ ] ] where the single - electron part @xmath47 is given by eq .",
    "( [ hami1 ] ) and the zeeman energy is taken into account with @xmath48 for the effective gyromagnetic ratio in gaas .",
    "this has been measured to be a realistic value for a similar system .",
    "@xcite we have @xmath49 for the dielectric constant in the coulomb interaction between the electrons .",
    "we apply the sdft according to the self - consistent kohn - sham ( ks ) scheme to obtain the total energies and spin densities of the system .",
    "the local spin - density approximation used for the exchange - correlation energy is based on the magnetic - field - independent formulation by attaccalite _",
    "@xcite according to our experience , it is the most accurate parametrization for finite two - dimensional electron systems in the zero - field limit .",
    "@xcite we solve the discretized ks equations in real space without implicit symmetry restrictions , which allows us a total freedom in shaping the external potential . the numerical process of solving the effective single - electron schrdinger equation is accelerated with the rayleigh quotient multigrid method .",
    "@xcite    our earlier calculations for rectangular  @xcite and parabolic  @xcite qd s show that our sdft scheme produces energies in a good accordance with the quantum monte carlo results .",
    "we have also noticed that the current - spin - density - functional theory ( csdft ) does not represent a qualitative improvement over the sdft in small quantum - dot systems .",
    "a detailed comparison between the sdft and csdft for a six - electron qd can be found in ref .  .",
    "figure  [ chem ] shows the chemial potentials     mev for clarity ) and impurity - containing ( solid lines ) quantum dot up to six electrons .",
    "the dotted lines denote the borders for the full spin polarization .",
    "the other spin - state domains are also marked above and below the curves corresponding to the clean and impurity - containing cases , respectively.,width=283 ]    @xmath50 , calculated in clean ( dashed lines ) and impurity - containing ( solid lines ) qd s up to six electrons .",
    "due to the spin - degeneracy , the chemical potentials shift generally in adjacent pairs with increasing @xmath51 corresponding to the well - known even - odd effect of experimental current peaks .",
    "@xcite in the clean case , however , occasional pairing of @xmath52 and @xmath53 is clearly observable , e.g. , with @xmath54 and @xmath3 , and with @xmath55 and @xmath56 at @xmath57 t. this is caused by hund s rule , i.e. , near a degenerate point it is energetically favorable to have parallel spins between the electrons due to the exchange interaction .",
    "this leads to partial spin polarization ( @xmath58 ) in the clean dot with @xmath55 and @xmath59 at @xmath60 t and @xmath61 , respectively . in the impurity - containing dot those states are missing due to the avoided level crossings in the single - electron spectrum ( see fig .  [ single ] )",
    "generally , the impurity smoothes the behavior of the chemical potential , reflecting the flattening of the single - electron energies studied above .",
    "this is in agreement with the results by gl  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for randomly distributed impurities .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ chem ] the impurity does not affect considerably the onset for the full spin polarization ( dotted lines ) . as @xmath45 increases , however , this point in the clean qd shifts to higher @xmath51 than in the impurity - containing dot .",
    "simultaneously , the @xmath6 spacings decrease relatively more rapidly in the latter case than in the clean dot",
    ". the reason is the fact that the impurity pushes the electrons to the soft - confinement region near the edges , whereas the clean dot represents a more compact state with higher addition energies .      in the description above , the impurity is kept in a fixed position at @xmath39 nm laterally from the dot center .",
    "next , we consider changes in the total angular momentum as @xmath30 is varied ( while @xmath31 is kept constant ) in magnetic fields corresponding to the mdd state . in a circularly symmetric qd , the mdd has the occupation on the single - particle states with angular momentum eigenvalues @xmath62 , giving @xmath63 for the total angular momentum .",
    "@xcite in the case of a broken circular symmetry , the onset for the mdd can be defined from the last cusp in the chemical potential indicating the full spin polarization ( see fig .",
    "[ chem ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental identification of the mdd phase by measuring the magnetic field evolution of the coulomb blockade peaks .",
    "@xcite since the angular momentum @xmath64 is not a good quantum number for a non - circular confinement , we compute @xmath65 in the following as a sum of the expectation values for the single - electron angular momentum operator , @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "the summation is over all the occupied ks states .    in fig .",
    "[ lzdens ]     and @xmath67 t , respectively.,width=302 ]    we present how the six - electron mdd at @xmath68 t is affected by the impurity shifted through the whole qd region . except for the kink at @xmath69 nm , corresponding to the radius",
    "at which the impurity penetrates the edge of the qd , @xmath70 increases smoothly from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , i.e. , from the mdd to a quantum ring with @xmath73 states occupied .",
    "the stability is also visualized in the density insets of fig .",
    "[ lzdens ] corresponding to different impurity locations .",
    "the dashed line shows the equivalent evolution at @xmath74 t , still corresponding to the mdd region in the clean dot .",
    "as @xmath75 , however , we find a transition to the next quantum - ring state with @xmath76 states occupied .",
    "the rounded edges of the qd clearly make the ring - like states sensitive to the magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , the mdd remains as a rather compact state spread across the highly - confined central region as the magnetic field is varied .",
    "finally , we investigate the tendency of the many - electron structure to screen the external impurity . for that purpose",
    ", we consider the total magnetization , defined at zero temperature as @xmath77 . in fig .",
    "[ magnet ] we plot @xmath78     ( plus markers ) and @xmath3 nm ( cross markers ) with ( solid curves ) and without ( dashed curves ) the electron - electron interactions .",
    "the effective bohr magneton @xmath79.,width=302 ]    as a function of @xmath51 for six - electron , fully - polarized qd s in both noninteracting and interacting cases and with the impurity locations @xmath80 and @xmath3 nm laterally from the qd center .",
    "the noninteracting energy is computed directly as a sum of the six lowest single - electron energies . as the impurity is shifted off the dot center ,",
    "the lowest single - electron states decouple ( see fig .  1 in ref .  ) , leading to a considerably smaller @xmath81 and disappearance of the transition at @xmath82 t in the noninteracting systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the interacting systems show frequent oscillations due to the entanglement of the energy levels , i.e. , periodic changes in the fully - polarized ground state .",
    "@xcite the qd s with different impurity locations behave similarly , indicating that the circular properties are preserved also when the impurity is off - center .",
    "this verifies the screening of the impurity by the electrons .",
    "the importance of screening is evident also from the work by halonen  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite who considered impurity - containing qd s with two and three electrons .",
    "the same tendency was also found in the magnetization of the two - electron square qd s studied by sheng and zu .",
    "@xcite in our forthcoming studies , we will examine the high magnetic field regime as a function of the impurity parameters in more detail .",
    "we have reported a transport measurement of a vertical quantum dot , giving single - electron energies strongly deviating from the fock - darwin spectrum . we have found a realistic model for the sample dot by including a coulombic impurity in the external parabolic potential that has soft edges .",
    "the parameters obtained for the model potential indicate a strong confinement resulting from the grown - induced formation of the qd , and a repulsive , multiple charged impurity particle shifted both laterally and vertically from the qd center . using the model and the spin - density - functional theory , we have studied the energetics and structural properties of the corresponding many - electron problem .",
    "the impurity evens out the state alternation as a function of the magnetic field by lifting the degeneracies , but it does not affect remarkably the onset of the full spin polarization .",
    "the stability of both the maximum - density droplet and the magnetization verify that the many - electron structure reduces the distortion apparent in the single - electron properties .",
    "the future experiments may illustrate the damping of the irregular behavior in actual quantum - dot devices as the number of electrons increases .",
