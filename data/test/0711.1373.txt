    "further , @xmath2 can be computed via the recurrence @xmath15 .",
    "richard stanley plotted the zeros of @xmath16 and asked what happens as their degrees go to infinity .",
    "see figure 1(a ) .",
    "since the zeros of @xmath17 are symmetric about the real axis , many times we restricted our attention to the upper half - plane .",
    "we single out many intriguing features of this plot :    1 .",
    "the zeros are clustering about the unit circle ; 2 .",
    "there is a sparse of zeros in the left half plane ; 3 .",
    "there are gaps near the angle @xmath18 and at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "4 .   there may be two scales of zeros for those either outside or inside the unit circle ; 5 .",
    "there are @xmath21 zeros outside the unit circle and @xmath22 inside .",
    "we use @xmath6 rather than other powers of @xmath3 by inspiration from the hardy - ramanujan asymptotics from @xmath7 .",
    "empirically we expect the order of convergence of the zeros to be @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we compare these proposed features with the computed zeros of @xmath24 in figure 1(b ) . at degree @xmath25",
    "all three gaps now disappear while a second family of zeros inside the unit disk appears .",
    "this is especially noteworthy at @xmath19 since @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the order @xmath22 of zeros is confirmed inside the disk .",
    "these zeros were found using the mpsolve program described in @xcite which is our major tool to obtain the zeros of high degree polynomials .",
    "its underlying algorithm is based on simultaneous approximation of all the zeros and uses the aberth iteration .",
    "one advantage of mpsolve is that it handles integer coefficients with arbitrary large precision .",
    "this ability is critical since the coefficients of the partition polynomials have hundreds of digits ; for example , in figure 2(b ) there is a plot of the number of digits of the 25,000 degree partition polynomial .",
    "note that the maximal coefficient 168 digits and that the polynomial is unimodal .",
    "for comparison in figure 2(a ) , we included @xmath26 whose maximal number of digits is 19 .",
    "+    in working with such polynomials , a natural question is how to test whether the zeros are relatively correct .",
    "the zeros obtained have , say , 20 digits , yet the coefficients of the polynomial have hundreds of integer coefficients .",
    "so there is no possibility of ever checking directly that the zeros through evaluation . on the other hand",
    ", the zeros do pass a simple numerical test .",
    "we observe that the sum of the zeros equals the negative of the coefficient of @xmath27 in @xmath0 which is always 1 .",
    "the sum of the computed zeros are : at degree 6000 , @xmath28 ; at degree 10,000 , @xmath29 ; at degree 15,000 , @xmath30 ; and at degree 20,000 , @xmath31 . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the coefficient of @xmath32 is @xmath33 and equals the second elementary symmetric function of the zeros . at degree 6000 , for the computed zeros this evaluates to @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the zeros that mpsolve produces coincide extremely well with the asymptotics we discovered so we have much confidence in the computation . in our work",
    "there was a complementary interplay between developing the asymptotics and numerically determining their limiting behavior and their densities .",
    "the appealing question of determining the limiting behavior of the zeros is intimately connected with the analytic problem of finding asymptotic formulas for these polynomials as their degrees go to infinity .",
    "we now formalize what we mean by the convergence of the zeros .",
    "let @xmath35 denote the finite set of zeros of the polynomial @xmath17 . then the _ zero attractor _",
    "@xmath36 of the polynomial sequence @xmath37 is the limit of @xmath35 in the hausdorff metric on the compact subsets of @xmath38 . in figure 3(a ) , there is the plot of the full zero attractor as well as a closeup of the upper left - hand quarter of the attractor in figure 3(b ) .",
