    "systems with interacting localized magnetic moments play an important role in modern spintronics @xcite . among those systems the ones where the interaction between localized spins is due to the itinerant carriers are very attractive for semiconductor spintronics because the magnetic properties of the systems can be manipulated by the itinerant carrier density .",
    "the latter in semiconductors can be easily varied using external gate voltage .",
    "this , so - called itinerant magnetism , is provided by the exchange interaction introduced by ruderman and kittel @xcite in the context of the hyperfine interaction between a localized nuclear spin and conduction electrons and later by kasuya and yosida @xcite in the context of the @xmath0 interaction between conduction electrons and magnetic ions of transition metals .",
    "the essence of the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) itinerant magnetism is that the exchange interaction between localized spins and paramagnetic itinerant carrier system induces oscillations of the itinerant carrier spin density .",
    "these oscillations propagating in an originally non - magnetic system couple localized spins and create a magnetic structure .",
    "this type of interaction becomes relevant when the direct spin - spin coupling is weak , _",
    "i.e. _ , in diluted systems .",
    "for example ferromagnetism in bulk diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite is of the rkky type .",
    "it was investigated in ga@xmath1mn@xmath2as using high - resolution scanning tunneling microscope @xcite .",
    "the rkky effect has also been widely studied in mesoscopic systems both without spin - orbit interactions @xcite and with spin - orbit interactions @xcite . in the latter case",
    "spin - orbit interactions make the rkky spin density oscillations anisotropic .",
    "impact of electron - electron interactions on the rkky range function in one - dimensional quantum wires ( 1d qw ) was considered in refs . .",
    "it was shown that the range function is different from the one in non - interacting 1d qws .",
    "it turns out that due to electron - electron interactions the range function decays slower than in the non - interacting case .",
    "( color online ) a half - infinite 1d qw with a magnetic ion placed at its edge taken as a reference point .",
    "the ionic spin is @xmath3 and @xmath4 characterizes its spatial distribution .",
    "the electronic density is zero at the edge , @xmath5 .",
    "thus for @xmath6 one expects no rkky oscillations in the system .",
    "however , for @xmath7 the electronic density exhibits the friedel oscillations converging to the electronic density of the corresponding infinite 1d qw , @xmath8 .",
    "therefore for @xmath9 the exchange interaction takes place and is responsible for the rkky oscillations of the electron spin density.,width=8 ]    however , in spite of considerable amount of scientific research on the rkky interaction a little attention has been paid to the fact that the exchange interaction responsible for the rkky interaction is actually non - local in space but has a finite range @xmath4 given by the spatial spin distribution around the localization center . in theoretical models of the rkky interaction",
    "it is almost always assumed that @xmath6 and the exchange interaction has a point - like character which is modeled by the dirac delta - function .",
    "of course , in many cases it is a very good approximation when the wave function of a magnetic impurity is well localized which means that @xmath4 is less than all other relevant lengths present in the system .",
    "however , in semiconductors there is one important length , namely the wave length of the itinerant carriers living on the fermi surface , @xmath10 , which can be varied in a wide range .",
    "this can be done , _",
    "e.g. _ , by changing the carrier density with the help of a gate voltage .",
    "therefore , one can reach a situation where @xmath11 .    what is more interesting is that even in the case when @xmath12 it can happen that in a given system the rkky spin density oscillations appear only due to a finite value of @xmath4 and can not appear if @xmath6 .",
    "such a situation takes place , for example , when magnetic impurities are deposited on a surface of a paramagnetic bulk sample .",
    "the wave function of the itinerant carriers in the sample is equal to zero on its surface and therefore for a point - like model of the exchange interaction , @xmath6 , the rkky spin density oscillations do not appear and can not couple the spins of the magnetic impurities on the surface .",
    "therefore , no magnetic ordering will take place .",
    "however , in reality @xmath9 and the exchange interaction will definitely produce the spin density oscillations with the subsequent magnetic structure of the impurity spins on the surface of the sample .",
    "thus , in this system a finite value of @xmath4 creates itinerant surface magnetism .    some efforts to consider a finite range of the exchange interactions",
    "were made in the research devoted to ferromagnetism in heusler alloys @xcite .",
    "an essential drawback of the models of the exchange interactions in those attempts was that in the limit @xmath13 the models did not reproduce point - like exchange interactions .",
    "however , it is desirable to reproduce the dirac delta - function in the limit @xmath13 because it is often used in many theoretical models and therefore one would like to make a comparison with traditional theories in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "a finite range exchange interaction which in the limit @xmath13 gives the traditional dirac delta - function model has been used in ref . to calculate the rkky exchange integrals and in ref . to study the rkky spin density oscillations in a mesoscopic ring . in particular , in ref .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a finite value of @xmath4 removes an unphysical divergency of the rkky integral at zero distance while in ref .",
    "it has been shown that any finite value of @xmath4 always becomes important if the number of the electrons in the ring is large enough .",
    "however , the research in ref . represented mainly a numerical experiment and , as a result , did not clarify the physical role played by the localization radius of the impurity spin .",
    "in addition , the rkky spin density oscillations in that study were also present in the limiting case @xmath13 and therefore a finite value of @xmath4 did not play any key role in the formation of the rkky spin density oscillations .    in the present work we use the model of ref .",
    "for a finite range exchange interaction in a system where the rkky spin density oscillations appear only if @xmath9 .",
    "the system represents a half - infinite 1d qw with a magnetic impurity on its edge .",
    "since the wave function of the itinerant carriers ( electrons to be definite ) is zero on the edge of the wire , the rkky spin density oscillations exist only if @xmath4 is finite . to understand the physical role played by the impurity spin localization radius in the rkky spin density oscillations we solve the problem _ analytically _ in the case when @xmath12 and calculate the coordinate dependence of the rkky oscillations in this system .",
    "we demonstrate that at large distances this dependence is identical to the one of the rkky oscillations which one would obtain in the limiting case @xmath6 of our model but for an infinite 1d qw with electrons whose mass is _ strongly _ modified by the localization radius of the impurity spin .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ fp ]",
    "we mathematically formulate the problem and solve it in section [ ds ] using the feynman diagram approach . in connection with recent experiments",
    "we make a suggestion in section [ sdsrkkyi ] about directionality of surface rkky interaction .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ s ] .",

    ", one can see that @xmath24 is not the eigenfunction of @xmath25 and thus , as mentioned above , the quantum number @xmath16 is not the electron momentum .",
    "the electronic density vanishes on the edge of the wire .",
    "far from the edge it has the value which it would have in an infinite 1d qw with the fermi momentum @xmath26 ( in the infinite case it would be real momentum ) , @xmath27 in the region close to the edge the electronic density shows oscillations known as the friedel oscillations .",
    "the half - infinite quantum wire can be modeled by the following potential : @xmath28    the second quantized hamiltonian of the half - infinite 1d qw without the magnetic impurity thus reads in the coordinate basis as @xmath29\\hat{\\psi}_\\sigma(x)+\\\\ & + \\sum_\\sigma\\int dx\\:u(x)\\hat{\\psi}_\\sigma^\\dagger(x)\\hat{\\psi}_\\sigma(x ) , \\end{split } \\label{h_0}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the electronic creation and annihilation field operators of the half - infinite 1d qw .",
