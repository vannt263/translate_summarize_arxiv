    "an epidemiological line list  @xcite is a listing of individuals suffering from a disease that describes both their demographic details as well as the timing of clinically and epidemiologically significant events during the course of disease .",
    "these are typically used during outbreak investigations of emerging diseases to identify key features , such as incubation period , symptoms , associated risk factors , and outcomes .",
    "the ultimate goal is to understand the disease well enough to stop or control the outbreak .",
    "ready availability of line lists can also be useful in contact tracing as well as risk identification of spread such as the spread of middle eastern respiratory syndrome ( mers ) in saudi arabia or ebola in west africa .",
    "formats of line lists are generally dependent on the kind of disease being investigated .",
    "however , some interesting features that are common for most formats include demographic information about cases .",
    "demographic information can include age , gender , and location of infection .",
    "depending on the disease being investigated , one can consider other addendums to this list , such as disease onset features ( onset date , hospitalization date and outcome date ) and clinical features ( comorbidities , secondary contact , animal contact ) .    traditionally , line lists have been curated manually and have rarely been available to epidemiologists in near - real time .",
    "our primary objective is to automatically generate line lists of emerging diseases from open source reports such as who bulletins  @xcite and make such lists readily available to epidemiologists .",
    "previous work  @xcite has shown the utility in creating such lists through labor intensive human curation .",
    "we now seek to automate much of this effort .",
    "* to the best of our knowledge , our work is the first to automate the creation of line lists . *",
    "the availability of massive textual public health data coincides with recent developments in text modeling , including distributed vector representations such as word2vec  @xcite and doc2vec  @xcite .",
    "these neural network based language models when trained over a representative corpus convert words to dense low - dimensional vector representations , most popularly known as word embeddings .",
    "these word embeddings have been widely used with considerable accuracy to capture linguistic patterns and regularities , such as vec(_paris _ ) - vec(_france _ )",
    "@xmath0 vec(_madrid _ ) - vec(_spain _ )  @xcite .",
    "a second development relevant for line list generation pertains to semantic dependency parsing , which has emerged as an effective tool for information extraction , e.g. , in an open information extraction context  @xcite , negation detection  @xcite , relation extraction  @xcite and event detection  @xcite . given an input sentence ,",
    "dependency parsing is typically used to extract its semantic tree representations where words are linked by directed edges called _",
    "dependencies_.    building upon these techniques ,",
    "we formulate * guided deep list * , a novel framework for automatic extraction of line list from who bulletins  @xcite .",
    "* guided deep list * is guided in the sense that the user provides a seed indicator ( or , keyword ) for each line list feature to guide the extraction process .",
    "* guided deep list * uses neural word embeddings to expand the seed indicator and generate a set of indicators for each line list feature .",
    "the set of indicators is subsequently provided as input to dependency parsing based shortest distance and negation detection approaches for extracting line list features . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : ll_overall ] ,",
    "* guided deep list * takes a who bulletin as input and outputs epidemiological line list in tabular format where each row represents a line list case and each column depicts the features corresponding to each case .",
    "the extracted line list provides valuable information to model the epidemic and understand the segments of population who would be affected .",
    "our main contributions are as follows .",
    "+ @xmath1 * automated : * * guided deep list * is fully automatic , requiring no human intervention .",
    "+ @xmath1 * novelty : * to the best of our knowledge , there has been no prior systematic efforts at tabulating such information automatically from publicly available health bulletins .",
    "+ @xmath1 * real - time : * * guided deep list * can be deployed for extracting line list in a ( near ) real - time setting .",
    "+ @xmath1 * evaluation : * we present a detailed and prospective analysis of * guided deep list * by evaluating the automatically inferred line list against a human curated line list for mers outbreaks in saudi arabia .",
    "we also compare * guided deep list * against a baseline method .",
    "+ @xmath1 * epidemiological inferences : * finally , we also demonstrate some of the utilities of real - time automated line listing , such as inferring the demographic distribution and symptoms - to - hospitalization period .",
    "in this manuscript , we intend to focus on middle eastern respiratory syndrome ( mers ) outbreaks in saudi arabia  @xcite ( 2012-ongoing ) as our case study .",
    "mers was a relatively less understood disease when these outbreaks began .",
    "therefore , mers was poised as an emerging outbreak leading to good bulletin coverage about the infectious cases individually .",
    "this makes these disease outbreaks ideally suited to our goals .",
    "mers is infectious as well and animal contact has been posited as one of the transmission mechanisms of the disease . for each line list case , we seek to extract automatically three types of epidemiological features as follows .",
    "( a ) * demographics : * age and gender , ( b ) * disease onset : * onset date , hospitalization date and outcome date and ( c ) * clinical features : * animal contact , secondary contact , comorbidities and specified healthcare worker ( abbreviated as hcw ) .",
    "in  [ fig : ll_block ] , we show all the internal components comprising the framework of * guided deep list*. * guided deep list * takes multiple who mers bulletins as input .",
    "the textual content of each bulletin is pre - processed by sentence splitting , tokenization , lemmatization , pos tagging , and date phrase detection using spacy  @xcite and basis technologies rosette language processing ( rlp ) tools  @xcite .",
    "the pre - processing step is followed by three levels of modeling as follows .",
    "( a ) level 0 modeling for extracting demographic information of cases , such as age and gender . in this level",
    ", we also identify the key sentences related to each line list case , ( b ) level 1 modeling for extracting disease onset information and ( c ) level 2 modeling for extracting clinical features .",
    "this is the final level of modeling in * guided deep list * framework .",
    "features extracted at this level are associated with two labels : _ y _ or _",
    "n_. therefore , modeling at this level combines neural word embeddings with dependency parsing - based negation detection approaches to classify the clinical features into _ y _ or _",
    "n_. in the subsequent section , we will discuss each internal component of * guided deep list * in detail .",
    "given multiple who mers bulletins as input , * guided deep list * proceeds through three levels of modeling for extracting line list features .",
    "we describe each level in turn .      in level 0 modeling",
    ", we extract the age and gender for each line list case .",
    "these two features are mentioned in a reasonably structured way and therefore , can be extracted using a combination of regular expressions as shown in algorithm  [ al : level0 ] .",
    "one of the primary challenges in extracting line list cases is the fact that a single who mers bulletin can contain information about multiple cases .",
    "therefore , there is a need to distinguish between cases mentioned in the bulletin . in level 0 modeling ,",
    "we make use of the age and gender extraction to also identify sentences associated with each case .",
    "since age and gender are the fundamental information to be recorded for a line list case , we postulate that the sentence mentioning the age and gender will be the starting sentence describing a line list case ( see the textual block in figure  [ fig : ll_overall ] ) .",
    "therefore , the number of cases mentioned in the bulletin will be equivalent to the number of sentences mentioning age and gender information .",
    "we further postulate that information related to the other features ( disease onset or critical ) will be present either in the starting sentence or the sentences subsequent to the starting one not mentioning any age and gender related information ( ( see the textual block in figure  [ fig : ll_overall ] ) ) . for more details on level 0 modeling",
    ", please see algorithm  [ al : level0 ] . in algorithm",
    "[ al : level0 ] , @xmath2 represents the number of line list cases mentioned in the bulletin and @xmath3 represents the set of sentences mentioning the @xmath4 case .",
    "n = 0 ; + @xmath3 = null ; + @xmath5 = ` \\s+(?p < age>\\d{1,2})(.{0,20})(\\s+|-)(?p < gender > woman|man|male|female|boy|girl|housewife ) ` ; + @xmath6 = ` \\s+(?p",

    "for instance , consider the sentences @xmath8**_the patient had no contact with animals _ * * and @xmath9**_the patient was supposed to have no contact with camels_**. the terms _ animals _ and _ camels _ appear in similar contexts in both @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "both the terms _ animals _ and _ camels _ are indicative of information pertaining to patient s exposure to animals or animal products .",
    "similarly , consider the sentences @xmath12**_the patient had an onset of symptoms on 23rd january 2016 _ * * and @xmath13**_the patient developed symptoms on 23rd january 2016_**. the terms _ onset _ and _ symptoms _ are indicators for the onset date feature and both of them appear in similar contexts or contexts of each other in @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    for the template learning process ,",
    "neural network inspired word2vec models are ideally suited to our goals because these models work on the hypothesis that words sharing similar contexts or tending to appear in the contexts of each other have similar embeddings . in recent years , word2vec models based on the skip - gram architectures  @xcite have emerged as the most popular word embedding models for information extraction tasks  @xcite .",
    "we used two variants of skip - gram models : ( a ) the skip - gram model trained using the negative sampling technique ( * sgns *  @xcite ) and ( b ) the skip - gram model trained using hierarchical sampling ( * sghs *  @xcite ) to generate embeddings for each term in the who vocabulary @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath16 refers to the list of all unique terms extracted from the entire corpus of who disease outbreak news ( dons ) corresponding to all diseases downloaded from http://www.who.int / csr / don / archive / disease / en/. the embeddings for each term in @xmath16 were provided as input to level 1 modeling and level 2 modeling as shown in  [ fig : ll_block ] .",
    "the level 1 modeling is responsible for extracting the disease onset features , such as symptom onset date , hospitalization date and outcome date for each linelist case , say the @xmath4 case . for extracting a given disease onset feature",
    ", the level 1 modeling takes three inputs : ( a ) seed indicator for the feature , ( b ) the word embeddings generated using * sgns * or * sghs * for each term in the who vocabulary @xmath16 and ( c ) @xmath3 representing the set of sentences describing the @xmath4 case for which we are extracting the feature .",
    "[ [ growth - of - seed - indicator ] ] * growth of seed indicator * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the first phase of level 1 modeling , we discover the top-@xmath17 similar ( or , closest ) indicators in the embedding space to the seed indicator for each feature .",
    "the similarity metric used is the standard cosine similarity metric .",
    "therefore , we expand the seed indicator to create a set of @xmath18 indicators for each feature . in table",
    "[ fig : seed ] we show the indicators discovered by * sgns * for each disease onset feature given the seed indicators as input .",
    "onset date & onset &    .seed indicator and the discovered indicators using word embeddings generated by * sgns * [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     * what insights can epidemiologists gain about the mers disease from automatically extracted line lists ? *    finally , we show some of the utilities of automated line lists by inferring different epidemiological insights from the line list extracted by * guided deep list*. + * demographic distribution . * in figure",
    "[ fig : ll_overall ] , we show the age and gender distribution of the affected individuals in the extracted line list . we observe that males are more prone to getting infected by mers rather than females .",
    "this is expected as males have a higher probability of getting contacted with infected animals ( animal contact ) or with each other ( secondary contact ) .",
    "also individuals aged between 40 and 70 are more prone to getting infected as evident from the age distribution .",

    "* we analyzed the symptoms - to - hospitalization period by analyzing the difference ( in days ) between onset date and hospitalization date in the extracted line list as shown in figure  [ fig : inho ] .",

    "this depicts a prompt responsiveness of the concerned health authorities in saudi arabia in terms of admitting the individuals showing symptoms of mers . in figure",
    "[ fig : hoou ] , we also show a distribution of the hospitalization - to - outcome period ( in days ) .",
    "interestingly , we see that the distribution has a peak at 0 which indicates that most of the infected individuals admitted to the hospital died on the same day indicating high fatality rate of mers case .    0.5     0.5",
