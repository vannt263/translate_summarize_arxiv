    "with the advent of the space observatories , _",
    "chandra  _ and _ xmm - newton  _ , fundamental progress in the study of x - ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) has become possible .",
    "x - ray spatially resolved studies of radio loud agns have been performed and those radiative processes , which are responsible for x - ray emission far from the nucleus , in the jets , hot spots and lobes , have been investigated .",
    "+ in the last years many studies have been produced on each of these structures ( harris & krawczynski 2000 , hardcastle et al .",
    "2002 , croston et al .",
    "2005 , kataoka  stawarz 2005 ) .",
    "the aim is to reach a clearer knowledge of the physics powering each component and of their relative interplay . among the extended structures which emit x - ray photons , the lobes are the faintest and most difficult regions to detect . on the other hand ,",
    "x - ray observations provide important physical information .",
    "in fact , it is thought that x - ray emission in the lobes is due to inverse compton ( ic ) by relativistic electrons .",
    "ic scattering in radio lobes can occur either between @xmath2 electrons and cmb photons ( harris & grindlay 1979 , miley 1980 ) or between @xmath3 electrons and nuclear photons ( brunetti et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "the last case is more relevant in the context of powerful and compact ( @xmath4 kpc ) radio galaxies .",
    "a comparison of the radio and x - ray fluxes provides a direct estimate of the average magnetic field ( b@xmath1 ) along the line of sight and , independently the number densities of the ic emitting particles in the lobes .",
    "two are the main concerns in this kind of study : good statistics ( radio lobes are weak x - ray sources ) and spatial resolution to distinguish non thermal from thermal emission .",
    "in fact it is possible that external gas , compressed by the expansion of the radio lobes , emits in the x - ray band by thermal bremsstrahlung ( kraft et al .",
    "2000 , reynolds et al .",
    "2001 ) obviously the task is even more difficult if the radio galaxy is situated in a cluster . in spite of these problems , x - ray detections of extended synchrotron radio regions",
    "were already been achieved focusing on low redshift radio galaxies ( feigelson et al .",
    "1995 , kaneda et al .",
    "1995 , brunetti et al .",
    "1999 , tashiro et al .",
    "these early results from x - ray studies on lobes have opened a new field of research and in particular have allowed the first checks on the assumption of minimum energy condition in the lobe ( equipartition ) .",
    "several detections of radio lobes have been successively performed with chandra and xmm - newton ( isobe et al .",
    "2002 , grandi et al .",
    "2003 , comastri et al .",
    "2003 , hardcastle et al .",
    "2005 , croston et al . 2005 , kakatoa @xmath5 stawarz 2005 ) and the equipartition condition has been further investigated .",
    "there is not yet a general agreement : in some cases a substantial concordance between equipartition and inverse compton magnetic field has been claimed ( brunetti et al .",
    "2001 , hardcastle et al .",
    "2002 , belsole et al .",
    "2004 , croston et al .",
    "2005 , overzier et al .",
    "2005 ) , in other cases a moderate violation of equipartition ( _ b@xmath0  _ @xmath6 _",
    "b@xmath1  _ ) has been found ( brunetti et al .",
    "1999 , isobe et al .",
    "2002 , comastri et al .",
    "2003 , grandi et al .",
    "2003 , kataoka et al 2003,bondi et al .",
    "it is clear that slightly different assumptions drive to the two opposite results .",
    "the most reasonable conclusion is that the unbalance between the particle and magnetic field energy density is not dramatic and the equipartition argument is a viable zero - order reference guide .",
    "the spatial distribution of both magnetic field and particles within the lobes themselves is a second connected branch of investigation . specifically studying the variations of magnetic fields and particle densities with position",
    "turns out to be a useful procedure to get information on the dynamical plasma evolution .",
    "observationally attempts in addressing these problems have been performed for only a few radio galaxies .",
    "the results indicate an enhancement of the magnetic energy density towards the edge of the lobes ( tashiro et al .",
    "01 , isobe 2002 , 2005 )    pictor a  , a famous nearby ( z=0.035 ) radio bright ( @xmath7 w hz@xmath8 ) fanaroff riley ii ( frii ) radio galaxy , is an excellent candidate for studying x - ray ic emission from the lobes .",
    "actually , _ xmm - newton  _ discovered x - ray radiation associated to the extended radio lobes ( grandi et al .",
    "2003 ) . in spite of the relatively short exposure time ( @xmath9 ks ) and the very high background",
    ", a reasonably good spectrum was obtained from a circular region centered on the east lobe .",
    "however , the data interpretation was not univocal , as the x - ray spectrum could be described by both a power law ( @xmath10 ) and a thermal model ( @xmath11 kev ) .",
    "the presence of an extended emission , most likely to be ascribed to non - thermal processes , has been recently confirmed ( hardcastle & croston 2005 ) .    in order to definitively solve the ambiguity about the nature of the radio - lobe x - ray emission , _",
    "xmm - newton  _ re - pointed pictor a  on january 14 , 2005 .",
    "the observation was successful and , beyond our expectation , the mos1 signal - to - noise ratio was good enough to allow a spatially resolved spectral analysis of both the west and east radio lobes .",
    "the radio lobes were the target of the new _ xmm - newton  _ observation .",
    "for this reason , the epic / p - n and epic / mos1 cameras operated in full - frame mode , with thin optical filter . the epic / mos2 camera operated in small - window mode in order to assure the study of the nucleus without any pile up problem .",
    "p - n data were excluded because of a substantial problem with nuclear psf , which covers a great fraction of the x - ray emission from the lobes .",
    "therefore our study is only based on the mos1 instrument data .",
    "data reduction was performed using the software package sas , version 6.0 .",
    "a calibration index file appropriate for the date of the observation and data analysis ( july 2005 ) was produced .",
    "we identified two high background periods ( background flares ) and we excluded all periods with a count rate higher than 0.35 cts s@xmath8 . after the cleaning procedure , the net total exposure time was @xmath12 ks .",
    "we selected only those events with * pattern @xmath13 12 * ( single , double , triple and quadruple events ) and imposed the filter * # xmmea_em * in order to exclude artifact events .",
    "vla observations ( perley et al . 1997 ) of pictor a  show two nearly circular radio lobes with hot spots and a faint radio jet connecting the nucleus to the west hot spot .",
    "the same features can be observed in figure [ pica_4 ] ( _ upper panel _ ) , where the mos1 image ( 0.2 - 10 kev ) is shown .",
    "if the 20 cm radio contours are superposed on the _ xmm - newton  _ image , the spatial coincidence between radio and x - ray emission is unambiguous .",
    "in particular , the x - ray counterparts of the radio lobes are clearly visible as elongated emission around the bright nucleus . in comparison with the previous _ xmm - newton  _ observation , performed in 2001 ( grandi et al .",
    "2003 ) , the good quality of this new data has allowed two different kinds of analysis .",
    "in fact , we studied each lobe as a whole , but also performed a _ spatially resolved individual study _ on both lobes .",
    "in the following , we give a description of the regions chosen for the two studies .",
    "+ * the extended regions : e and w *  the selection of the studied regions was based on both x - ray and radio images .",
    "we selected two circular regions , one for each lobe , with different radius ( r ) ( r=88  for the east lobe and r=100  for the west lobe ) .",
    "afterwards we will refer to these two regions as * e  * and * w  * for east and west lobes , respectively . in order to avoid any nuclear contamination we excluded the emission coming from a circular region of r=120  centered on the nucleus .",
    "this choice is also supported by considerations based on the calibration report by ghizzardi ( xmm - soc - cal - tn-0022 ) .",
    "she clearly shows that 80% of the nuclear source emission is contained within about 30 arcsec .",
    "moreover , following ghizzardi s prescriptions we have evaluated encircled energy fraction for the nucleus in the case of an annulus comprising our selected lobe regions ( r@xmath14=120  , r@xmath15=222  .",
    "the result is that any possible nuclear contamination should be of the order of the measured errors for the fluxes .",
    "+ in the case of the west lobe , it was also necessary to exclude the jet emission ( a circle with r=22  ) and a point - like source ( r=15  ) .",
    "the excluded regions are represented in figure [ pica_4 ] ( _ upper panel _ ) .",
    "* the subregions *  in order to perform a spatially resolved study of the lobes , we selected rectangular subregions in each lobe , as shown in figure [ pica_4 ] ( _ lower pane _ ) . in",
    "what follows , we indicate these regions as * e1  * , * e2  * , * e3  * for the east lobe , and * w1  * , * w2  * , * w3  * for the west lobe , counting from top to bottom .",
    "we accumulated spectra of the two regions * e  * and * w  * , and of the subregions previously described , i.e. * e1  * , * e2  * , * e3  * and * w1  * , * w2  * , * w3  * in the energy range 0.2 - 10 kev . in each case , the background was extracted from a region of the same extension taken on the same ccd .",
    "+ spectral analysis was conducted on two different levels .",
    "first , we maximized the statistics and considered the * e  * and * w  * spectra in order to define which radiative process is causing the x - ray emission .",
    "afterwards , we analyzed the sub - region spectra .",
    "spectral analysis has been done with xspec , version 11.2.0 .",
    "every spectrum was grouped in order to ensure a minimum of 25 net counts in each bin . throughout the paper ,",
    "all errors are quoted at 90% confidence for two interesting parameters ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the radio fluxes of all the analyzed regions were derived at 20 cm from the vla image produced by perley et al .",
    "uncertainties in measurements of flux density of extended structures are difficult to determine for interferometric data .",
    "extended emission may be lost because the corresponding spacial frequencies are not sampled by the array of antennas .",
    "furthermore this radio source is at low declination and the vla observed it at a very low elevation , with not negligible atmospheric opacity at this frequency .",
    "these effects have been taken in consideration by perley et al .",
    "who find the vla total flux density , after the standard calibration , of about 6@xmath17 lower respect to the total flux density derived by single dish measurements .",
    "they ascribe this difference to the atmospheric opacity only , and correct the image accordingly . given the considerations above the uncertainty in the flux density measurements is dominated by residual calibration errors which can be estimate to be about 3@xmath17 .",
    "the first step of the study was aimed at solving the ambiguity ( thermal vs non - thermal ) about the origin of the lobes x - ray emission .",
    "consequently , we tested two different models : a thermal emission from hot diffuse gas ( _ mekal _ model in xspec , mewe et al . 1985 ) and a non - thermal radiation modeled with a pure power law . in both cases ,",
    "the acceptable range of n_h is consistent with the galactic line - of - sight value n_h@xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "thus we fixed the column density to the galactic value in order to reduce the parameters uncertainties .",
    "results in table 1 strongly suggest a non - thermal origin of the radiation . in each lobe",
    "a power law is preferred to a thermal model and the x - ray photon indeces are in very good agreement with the average radio slopes ( @xmath20 ) measured by perley et al .",
