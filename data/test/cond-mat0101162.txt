    "ever since landau@xcite suggested that the electron can be trapped by the deformable lattice , strongly coupled electron - phonon systems have been the subject of intensive examination . besides the investigations of those systems in which the lattice is coupled to the whole electronic band , there has been significant interest in the physics of a single polaron , in which the electron and the associated lattice deformation form a quasi - particle , spatially and spectrally decoupled from the rest of the system .",
    "lattice degrees of freedom make even a single polaron problem a many - body one .",
    "the analytical and numerical examinations of most electron - phonon models are thus difficult . for this reason",
    ", even the simple holstein  model@xcite ( suggested in 1959 ) is still being investigated in recent works .",
    "various methods have been proposed in order to calculate the polaron ground state of the holstein  model .",
    "almost exact results ( except for the adiabatic limit ) have been obtained with the quantum monte carlo calculations,@xcite the global - local method,@xcite the density matrix renormalization group method,@xcite and some exact diagonalization methods.@xcite    the main goal of this paper is to determine the elements important for the qualitative description of the polarons in the whole range of electron - phonon coupling .",
    "some of them , although already known , are found to be better understood when supplemented with additional details .",
    "the ground state of the holstein  system changes from the delocalized polaron state , in which the electron is nearly free , to the small and self - trapped polaron state , as the electron - phonon coupling @xmath0 increases .",
    "these two opposite limits are usually identified as the weak and strong coupling regime , respectively . in the weak coupling regime",
    "the influence of the small lattice deformation on polaron dynamics is very small , which makes the energies of polaron and electron hopping to neighboring sites similar , @xmath1 .",
    "the exact ground state is an eigenstate of the system momentum , regardless of the coupling.@xcite therefore the polaron ground state is delocalized for all parameters .",
    "however , in the strong coupling regime @xmath2 becomes negligible , leading to _ self - trapped _",
    "polaron states . according to ref .",
    ", the dynamics of the small self - trapped polaron can be separated into two time scales . on the short time scale ,",
    "the lattice deformation is centered at some lattice site , and the electron can virtually hop among the neighboring lattice sites . only after a certain number of such events ( of the order @xmath3 ) , the polaron as a whole tunnels to a new central site .",
    "the localized polaron states thus may lead to a very accurate estimation of the polaron ground state energy in the strong coupling regime .",
    "accordingly , for the self - trapped polarons , an exact diagonalization method of calculating the localized polaron states , rather than the translationally invariant ones , can be used . by comparison to the results of other methods",
    ", it is shown that this approach introduces only minor errors in the ground state energy of the self - trapped polaron .",
    "moreover , the localized polaron functions permit , unlike the translationally invariant ones , a separate analysis of the electron and phonon properties of the polaron . the local electron density , the mean lattice deformation , and the on - site zero point motions of the self - trapped polarons can be calculated in this way .    in the crossover ( intermediate ) regime , which is between the weak and the strong coupling regime",
    ", no known perturbation calculation converges , which complicates the discussion of the polaron nature .",
    "although it has been proved that the change of the polaron ground state with @xmath0 is smooth,@xcite the physics of the rapid crossover between two opposite limits of the electron - phonon coupling , in the small interval of @xmath0 s , is not completely clear . in ref .",
    "it has been claimed that the phonon excitation associated with the first excited state of the system is uncorrelated to the electron in the weak coupling regime , while it is confined to the electron in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the transition occurs in the crossover regime in which , in addition , the energy difference between the ground and excited states becomes small . in the present paper ,",
    "the excited polaron states are treated by the new method which uses variational approach in order to define and solve the generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "even if this method does not converge systematically , it does provide new results concerning the nature of the polaron ground and first excited state .",
    "the holstein  hamiltonian  reads    @xmath4    it describes the tight - binding electrons in the nearest - neighbor approximation , coupled to one branch of dispersionless optical phonons .",
    "@xmath5 is the creation operator for the electron of spin @xmath6 at lattice site @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the creation operator for the phonon .",
    "@xmath9 is the transfer ( hopping ) integral of the electron .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath0 are the phonon and the electron - phonon coupling energies , respectively .",
    "the holstein  hamiltonian  depends only on two ratios of relevant energy parameters : @xmath11 and @xmath12 , i.e. , the results will use @xmath10 as the energy unit .",
    "it is often convenient to express the lattice vibrations in terms of the nuclei space and momentum coordinates ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are space and momentum uncertainties of the harmonic oscillator ground state .",
    "@xmath16 is the mass of a nucleus and @xmath17 denotes the spring constant , @xmath18 . by noting that the electron - lattice displacement coupling constant @xmath19 , in @xmath20 , is independent of @xmath16 , an alternative set of holstein  hamiltonian  parameters can be introduced ,    @xmath21    which is convenient for the discussion of the adiabatic regime @xmath22 . here , @xmath23 is the electron effective mass and @xmath24 is the lattice constant .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath9 and @xmath25 ( the binding energy of the polaron for @xmath26 ) are independent of @xmath16 and thus they are the only parameters relevant in the adiabatic limit .    by using standard conventions for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,    @xmath29    eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) can be rewritten in momentum space and separated in two mutually commuting parts , @xmath30 ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the part which involves only the @xmath35 phonon mode , @xmath36 , can easily be transformed into the diagonal form , by using the unitary operator @xmath37 ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39 .",
    "any eigenstate of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , has the same mean total lattice deformation , @xmath42 ,    @xmath43    which is independent of @xmath9 .",
    "since the @xmath35 part of the hamiltoniancommutes with @xmath44 , it can be concluded that eq .",
    "( [ xtot ] ) is also valid for all eigenstates of the total holstein  hamiltonian .",
    "the phonon part of these eigenstates can be represented in the form of a direct product of two groups of states , the first one includes @xmath45 phonon modes , while the second includes only the @xmath35 phonon mode .",
    "this is useful because one can always check approximate computations by calculating @xmath46 , or include this property in the computation itself .",
    "this specific property of the @xmath35 mode is not restricted to the particular dimension of the system , nor to the number of electrons .",
    "moreover , it can also be found in some other models in which the electron - phonon coupling consists of the lattice deformation linearly coupled to the local electron density .",
    "a hint in this direction was reported for the first time in ref .  .",
    "the total momentum of the system , @xmath47 , is the sum of the electron and phonon momenta ,    @xmath48    and it commutes with the hamiltonian . in the present treatment ,",
    "only the low energy polaron states ( the low lying states of the system for which the electron and lattice part of the wave function are spatially bound ) , are explicitly calculated . in this case , the total momentum @xmath49 of the system is also the polaron momentum .",
    "the eigenstate computations reported here are based on the variational approach .",
    "still , from the physical and mathematical point of view , there are significant differences among them .",
    "each method is therefore described separately in the present section .",
    "it is important to notice that two qualitatively different kinds of polaron functions are employed , the _ localized _ ones and the _ translationally invariant _ ones .",
    "the primary objective of the methods with localized functions are self - trapped polaron states , i.e. , the strong coupling regime . on the other hand , translationally",
    "invariant states are devised in the first place with the weak coupling and crossover regime in mind .",
    "the methods with a small number of variational parameters are meant to help in understanding the basic properties of the polarons in different regimes of the holstein  model .",
    "again , the methods with a very large number of variational parameters are necessary to obtain accurate results for the polaron states .",
    "let us start with a simple localized polaron wave function formed as a product of the electron and the lattice part , centered at the lattice site @xmath51 ,    @xmath52    here , @xmath53 is the normalized electron function at site @xmath54 , @xmath55 , while @xmath56 denotes the coherent state operator acting on site @xmath57 , with a complex amplitude , @xmath58 ,    @xmath59    it is easy to see that operator @xmath56 shifts the space and momentum coordinates of lattice vibration at a site @xmath57 by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively ,    @xmath62 } e^{[-i2\\re(\\xi_m)x_0\\hat p_{j+m}/\\hbar]}\\\\ & \\times&e^{[i\\re(\\xi_m)\\im(\\xi_m)]}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the variational energy of the state ( [ iafunction ] ) , @xmath63 , is independent of @xmath51 , and is given by    @xmath64    the minimization of the energy with respect to @xmath65 establishes a simple relationship between the lattice mean deformation and electron density @xmath66 ,    @xmath67    so that only the equation for @xmath53 has to be solved .",
    "the well known approximate solution to this problem is the large holsteinpolaron@xcite valid in the long wave limit ,    @xmath68    the numerical scheme suggested in ref .  , and denoted here by @xmath50 ( @xmath50 for localized ) , is not restricted to long waves , and is used here in order to obtain the exact minimum of eq .",
    "( [ iaenergy ] ) .",
    "the energy , henceforth referred to as @xmath69 , depends only on two relevant hamiltonianparameters , @xmath9 and @xmath70 , and therefore @xmath69 and @xmath71 are both independent of @xmath16 . for this reason eq.([locking ] ) is sometimes referred to as the adiabatic locking of electron and lattice coordinates .",
    "it is noteworthy that the lattice part of the function @xmath72 is a simple product of coherent states with real amplitudes .",
    "consequently , the state of the lattice at some site is defined by the ground state of the displaced harmonic oscillator .",
    "the mean lattice deformation @xmath71 corresponds to the equilibrium position of that oscillator , while the lattice zero point motion is approximated in eq .",
    "( [ iafunction ] ) by that of the free lattice .",
    "next , we shall study a translationally invariant solution composed of a linear superposition of the localized states ( [ iafunction ] ) ,    @xmath75    @xmath76 describes the polaron state with the momentum  @xmath49 .",
    "a similar type of function was first proposed by toyozawa.@xcite in the present work , @xmath77 is used so that the mean total deformation of function ( [ tivfunction ] ) satisfies eq .",
    "( [ xtot ] ) ,    @xmath78    the expectation value of the polaron energy , @xmath79 , may be written in terms of @xmath80 ,    @xmath81    @xmath82 and @xmath83 are given in the appendix . a simple method for calculating the minimum of the energy @xmath79",
    "has not yet been proposed , but accurate results have been obtained in ref .   by using the toyozawa method , which includes a very large number of variational parameters .",
    "some additional approximations may be found in refs . and .",
    "the approximation used here simplifies the general expression in eq.([tivfunction ] ) by introducing the exponential form for functions @xmath53 and @xmath84,@xcite    @xmath85    equation  ( [ ve ] ) defines a polaron function @xmath86 which is completely determined by two parameters , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .    in what follows ,",
    "two different approaches are presented .",
    "the first , denoted by the index @xmath73 ( @xmath73 for translational ) , treats @xmath87 and @xmath88 as the variational parameters for which the energy minimum @xmath89 has to be found , and its corresponding polaron function is @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath73 method gives good results in the weak and the strong coupling regime .",
    "namely , in both of these limits , the function @xmath90 becomes similar to the polaron function obtained by the appropriate perturbative calculations .",
    "in the second approach , presented here for the first time , the variational method is used to define a generalized eigenvalue problem as follows .",
    "the polaron wave function , denoted by the index @xmath74 ( @xmath74 for combination of translational functions ) , is rewritten as a linear combination of functions @xmath91 ,    @xmath92    it is understood here that the functions @xmath93 form a set of @xmath94 generally nonorthogonal functions , defined by @xmath94 different pairs of parameters @xmath95 .",
    "again , the coefficients @xmath96 should be determined from the requirement that the expectation value of the energy ,    @xmath97    is minimal ,    @xmath98    or ,    @xmath99    the solution of this generalized eigenvalue problem is a set of @xmath94 orthogonal polaron functions , @xmath100 , with corresponding energies @xmath101 .",
    "the ground state energy is @xmath102 .",
    "one may always include the function @xmath103 in the sum ( [ lvfunction ] ) in order to ensure that the energy @xmath102 is the same or better than @xmath89 , the energy computed by the @xmath73 method .",
    "moreover , by paying some further attention to the starting set of functions @xmath91 in eq.([lvfunction ] ) at the outset , one is able to investigate the first excited state @xmath104 of the system , when this state corresponds to an excited polaron .",
    "the best results for the @xmath74 method are obtained when the number @xmath94 of @xmath91 functions in eq .",
    "( [ tivfunction ] ) changes with the hamiltonian  parameters .",
    "the special case where the @xmath74 method is used with constant @xmath105 is denoted by the index @xmath106 .",
    "finally , this paper presents the results of two numerical exact diagonalization methods.@xcite in order to compute the low energy polaron states , one approximates the infinite dimensional hamiltonian  matrix with a finite one , and proceeds with the exact diagonalization of this matrix .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue and eigenvector in such a reduced hilbert  space correspond to the polaron energy and wave function , respectively .",
    "for a large sparse matrix , the energy and the wave function can be calculated very accurately , by using an appropriate numerical scheme , in the present case the lanczos algorithm .",
    "the two exact diagonalization methods used here differ in the choice of the basis of the hilbert  space . in the first method,@xcite denoted by @xmath107 ( @xmath109 stands for exact diagonalization and @xmath73 for translational ) ,",
    "the general orthonormal state is given by    @xmath110    which describes an eigenstate of the system with momentum @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath111 is the number of phonons at the @xmath112th lattice site away from the electron .",
    "for example , at the site @xmath51 , and at the nearest neighbor lattice sites left and right from it , there are @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 phonons , respectively . the hamiltonian  ( [ h0 ] ) does not mix states ( [ tbstates ] ) with different momenta .",
    "therefore , the polaron function obtained by the @xmath107 method has the same @xmath49 momentum as the basis states .",
    "the current implementation of the @xmath107 method is highly accurate , and from a practical point of view may be treated as exact.@xcite for this reason , the @xmath107 results can be used to determine the numerical errors present in the other methods .",
    "the minimal number of states of the reduced basis necessary to obtain accurate results depends on the hamiltonian  parameters .",
    "this number for the @xmath107 method increases very rapidly for @xmath116 , @xmath9 , which prevents its use for both large @xmath0 and @xmath9 .    in the second exact diagonalization method , denoted by @xmath108 ( @xmath109 stands for exact diagonalization and @xmath50 for localized ) ,",
    "the general orthonormal state of the chosen basis is more complicated than for the @xmath107 method ,    @xmath117\\ ; \\mid n_0 , n_{-1 } , n_1, ...",
    ",n_m, ... \\rangle_j\\;.\\label{lbstates}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the @xmath118 and @xmath112 indices are given with respect to the center of polaron , which is placed at the site @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath119 creates an electron at the @xmath118th site from the polaron center at @xmath51 , @xmath111 is the number of extra phonons at the @xmath112th site away of the polaron center , when the lattice is already distorted by the coherent state operators @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath120 .",
    "the @xmath108 method calculates localized polaron wave functions .",
    "namely , eq .  ( [ lbstates ] ) describes a localized state , with the polaron center at site @xmath51 kept constant .",
    "the @xmath108 method is therefore accurate only in the strong coupling regime , in which the effects of polaron delocalization are negligible ( self - trapped polarons ) .    for a given set of hamiltonian  parameters , @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ lbstates ] ) are determined by the use of the @xmath50 method , i.e. , by minimizing the energy ( [ iaenergy ] ) , @xmath121 .",
    "if only those states ( [ lbstates ] ) with all @xmath122 are used in calculations , the @xmath108 method gives the same polaron wave function as the @xmath50 method .",
    "the additional states ( [ lbstates ] ) , with @xmath111 phonon excitations , are necessary to obtain the actual equilibrium positions of the lattice in the exact localized polaron state and the zero point motion of the renormalized lattice vibrations .",
    "it is worth noting that the electron and phonon parts of the @xmath108 polaron wave function can not be completely separated , as in the case of the @xmath50 function .    in the case of @xmath108 method ,",
    "the mean lattice deformation of the localized polaron is approximately taken care of by the product of the coherent states operators , @xmath123 , which keeps the necessary number of states ( [ lbstates ] ) , in the @xmath108 method , relatively small . in order to reduce the basis of the hilbert  space , the maximal allowed distance of the electron and phonons from the polaron center",
    "has been limited here by the choice @xmath124 .",
    "the distance @xmath125 has been determined from the condition that @xmath126 if @xmath127 .",
    "the maximal total number of phonons has been kept limited , retaining the states with @xmath128 . as the sum @xmath129 does not include the phonons associated with the coherent state operators @xmath56",
    ", the small value of @xmath129 is not a restriction on the overall amplitude of the lattice deformation .",
    "the accuracy of the results obtained by the @xmath108 method , supplemented by the two abovementioned criteria , depends of course on the values of parameters .    for the purpose of clarity",
    ", it seems appropriate at this point to review briefly the notation @xmath50 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 of all five presented methods .",
    "all methods based on the localized polaron function are denoted by the letter @xmath50 ( @xmath50 and @xmath108 methods ) , whereas all methods based on the translational function are denoted by the letter @xmath73 ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath107 methods ) . the letter @xmath109 denotes an exact diagonalization method ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 methods ) , while a single letter notation ( @xmath50 and @xmath73 ) suggests the simplest form of the method .",
    "as the variational methods of the preceding section themselves , the results of the corresponding calculations may be best understood in terms of the weak and strong coupling limits and the crossover between them .",
    "it has been shown previously,@xcite on the basis of the global - local method for @xmath130 , that the empirical relation    @xmath131    describes well the values of parameters for which the variation of the effective polaron mass with @xmath0 is the fastest .",
    "it will be also argued here that @xmath132 of eq .",
    "( [ romero ] ) describes accurately the crossover from the weak to the strong coupling limit with respect to the nature of the @xmath133 ground state .",
    "the latter changes continuously from the light delocalized state in the weak coupling limit to the heavy self - trapped state in the strong coupling limit , with the anticrossing of the two states at @xmath134 .",
    "the physical content of eq .",

    "both these conditions were qualitatively explained in ref .  .",
    "in the present section we first discuss the strong and the weak coupling limit , and then devote most of our attention to the crossover between the two .",
    "the nature of the self - trapped polaron may be discussed by analyzing the properties of the two polaron wave functions given by eqs .",

    "the negligible contribution of the lattice part to the overlap of any two localized polaron functions at different lattice sites results then in a negligible polaron hopping energy @xmath2 .    one may notice that in the limit @xmath141 the translational form of the polaron function ( [ tivfunction ] ) has no consequences on polaron energy , and the minimal values of the variational energies ( [ iaenergy ] ) and ( [ tivenergy ] ) coincide , i.e. , @xmath82 , @xmath142 in eq .",
    "( [ tivenergy ] ) .",
    "the hopping of the self - trapped polaron occurs only at the time scale which is much larger than the scale relevant for the local interplay between the electron and the lattice deformation .",
    "therefore an accurate description of the local polaron properties may be obtained even if the hopping of the polaron is completely omitted by using only localized polaron functions .",
    "the translational invariance of the polaron may be , however , always restored in the same way as the function ( [ iafunction ] ) is used to obtain ( [ tivfunction ] ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] that the electron affects mostly the central site of the small polaron .",

    "therefore in the strong coupling regime the first excited state should correspond to the excitation of the renormalized phonon mode , rather than to the excitation of the phonon of energy @xmath10 , which is uncorrelated to the polaron .",
    "one may also notice that the energy of the mean lattice deformation is larger for the @xmath108 method than the @xmath50 method ( for the @xmath50 method this energy is minimal ) .",
    "this is compensated for , however , with the lower energy associated with the zero point motion of the @xmath164 phonon mode , which makes the total polaron energy of the @xmath108 method lower .    for the more extended self - trapped polarons ,",
    "the renormalized normal phonon modes are expected to be spread over a number of lattice sites .",
    "consequently , a number of different phonon modes contribute to the lattice displacement at the lattice sites occupied by the polaron .",
    "thus the analysis of the on - site vibrations can not give direct information on the renormalized lattice modes .",
    "nevertheless , from the second plot in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] one may notice that the product of uncertainties @xmath168 shows a minor deviation from that of the harmonic vibration .",

    ", the @xmath73 method gives results close to the @xmath107 results .",
    "since the form of the function @xmath73 is quite simple , it will be used in this section as a basis for further discussion . in the weak coupling regime",
    ", the minimum of the variational energy @xmath89 corresponds to small values of the variational parameters @xmath87 and  @xmath169 .",
    "the standard perturbative ground state of the system with momentum @xmath49 in terms of the @xmath73 method polaron function may be written as follows :    @xmath170 the wave function ( [ wc1function ] ) has two parts .",
    "the main part corresponds to the free electron of momentum @xmath49 , and the smaller part , proportional to @xmath169 , corresponds to the electron dressed by one spatially correlated virtual phonon . at the threshold @xmath171 , the energy of such a polaron state intersects with the energy of the system consisting of the zero momentum polaron and one extra phonon with momentum @xmath171 , eq .",

    "so , for @xmath172 the ground state is achieved with one real phonon in the system which carries the system momentum and which is spatially uncorrelated with the polaron.@xcite for @xmath173 this state becomes the first excited state of the system .",
    "the difference between the energies of the ground state and the first excited state is the largest for @xmath133 , and is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "the validity of the perturbative treatment requires that the weight of the second term in eqs .",

    "@xmath88 is independent of @xmath0 , which makes the correlation length finite , even in the limit @xmath179 for which the lattice deformation vanishes , @xmath180 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the electron - lattice deformation correlation length and the polaron delocalization range are of the same order for the localized functions .",
    "this may be easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ iafunction ] ) . in the limit",
    "@xmath179 they both become infinite .",
    "thus in the weak coupling regime one obtains a localized polaron state @xmath181 of very large width , but associated with a tiny lattice deformation .",
    "this is specific for one dimensional systems in which an attractive symmetric potential has always a bound electron state .",
    "therefore the corresponding polaron energy is less than the free electron energy @xmath182 . in higher dimensions ,",
    "an arbitrary attractive symmetric potential does not have a bound electron state for sufficiently small g ( or the electron binding energy is too small to balance the lattice deformation energy ) , and the total polaron energy is larger than @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is the dimension of the system .",
    "this explains why , in the weak coupling regime , the adiabatic ( localized ) polaron functions@xcite fail to have an energy lower than the free electron energy , for the dimension of the system greater than one .",
    "a detailed parallel perturbative analysis of polarons in one , two , and three dimensions is given in ref .  .",
    "in the crossover regime the polaron hopping energy @xmath2 is not negligible , and the translationally invariant polaron functions should be used in order to obtain the full physical picture of the polaron . in order to calculate the numerical errors of different methods accurately ,",
    "the present discussion of the crossover regime is restricted to the values of @xmath9 smaller than @xmath185 , for which results from the @xmath107 method are available .    in order to examine the crossover regime",
    "it is instructive to calculate the energy difference between the ground and first excited state , @xmath186 .",
    "let @xmath187 denote the value of @xmath0 for which this difference is minimal ,    @xmath188    our results indicate that @xmath187 is very close to the value of @xmath132 given by eq .",

    "the analysis of the effective mass,@xcite variational energy of the polaron ground state,@xcite polaron size,@xcite as well as the behavior of the first excitation energy , suggest that a dramatic change in the nature of the polaron ground state and the first excited state are intimately related in the crossover regime .",
    "this can be well understood by considering the properties of the wave function in the @xmath73 method . near @xmath187 , this polaron wave function has two separate energy minima in the @xmath87-@xmath88 parameter space defined by eq .",

    "[ f06 ] , the excitation of the renormalized phonon mode explains the nature of the first excited state in the strong coupling limit . in ref .",

    "therefore in the strong coupling regime the first excited state , which has been identified here as a local renormalized phonon mode of the self - trapped polaron , should be basically a symmetric oscillation of the lattice deformation around the central polaron site . in the vicinity of @xmath132 , on the other hand ,",
    "the nature of the first excited state is currently explained by the anticrossing of the self - trapped and the delocalized polaron state .",
    "the question of how the excited self - trapped polaron state in the strong coupling regime and the first excited state near @xmath132 may be linked together is a matter of further considerations .",
    "one may speculate that the anticrossing of the excited self - trapped polaron state and the delocalized state will give the answer .",
    "the present paper discusses the ground and first excited states of the polaron for three different regimes of the electron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the results can be briefly summarized as follows . in the strong coupling regime",
    "the polaron hopping energy to neighboring sites is negligible , and the self - trapped polaron states are obtained .",
    "the results of the @xmath108 method suggest that the adiabatic picture of the localized polaron state is valid , in which some of the local lattice vibrations are renormalized by the presence of the electron .",
    "the numerical data show no significant deviation from the adiabatic locking relation ( [ locking ] ) of the electron site density and the mean lattice deformation . in the small polaron case , the predominant effect of the electron is the lowering of the frequency of the vibration at the central polaron site .",
    "the excitation of the renormalized phonon mode corresponds to the first excited state of the small self - trapped polaron .",
    "the nature of the polaron ground state in the crossover regime has been discussed in a number of papers , and its rapid change with @xmath0 has been well established numerically . the difference between the energies of the first excited state and the ground state , as a function of @xmath0 , has a minimum for @xmath192 .",
    "it is shown , by using the @xmath106 method , that the anticrossing of the self - trapped and the delocalized polaron state can link the behavior of the ground and first excited polaron state . according to the @xmath74 method , for @xmath196",
    "the effective mass of the ground state is larger than the effective mass of the first excited state , while for @xmath194 the opposite is true .",
    "in addition , it is found that @xmath187 , which characterizes the first excited state , and @xmath132 , obtained from ground state analysis ( eq.([romero ] ) ) almost coincide for @xmath228 .    upon further reduction of @xmath0 the total mean number of phonons bound by",
    "the polaron becomes smaller than one , and the weak coupling regime is reached .",
    "the nearly free electron is dressed by a cloud of virtual phonons , and its mass is slightly renormalized .",
    "the first excited state of the system , with momentum @xmath229 , can be viewed as the ground state of the polaron plus one additional uncorrelated phonon , rather than as an excited polaron .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that there is a simple sum rule for the mean total lattice deformation , eq .",
    "( [ xtot ] ) , which is valid for any number of electrons and is independent of the system dimension .",
