    "the phenomenon of escape from a locally stable equilibrium state arises in a multitude of scientific contexts  @xcite .",
    "if  a nonlinear system is subjected to continual random perturbations ( ` noise ' ) , eventually a sufficiently large fluctuation will drive it over an intervening barrier to a new equilibrium state .",
    "the mean amount of time required for this to occur typically grows exponentially as the strength of the random perturbations tends to zero .",
    "research on this phenomenon has focused on the case when the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the absence of random perturbations are specified by a _",
    "potential function_. in  a recent paper  @xcite we have introduced a new technique for computing the weak - noise asymptotics of the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) to the barrier .",
    "our  technique , unlike the bulk of earlier work , is not restricted to the case when the zero - noise dynamics arise from a potential . because of this we  can readily and quantitatively treat systems without ` detailed balance , ' whose dynamics are determined by non - gradient drift fields , or are otherwise time - irreversible .",
    "we  deal here with _ overdamped _",
    "systems , in  which inertia plays no role . overdamped systems without detailed balance arise in the theory of glasses and other disordered materials  @xcite , chemical reactions far from equilibrium  @xcite , stochastically modelled computer networks  @xcite , evolutionary biology  @xcite , and theoretical ecology  @xcite .    in  the multidimensional escape problems most frequently considered in the literature , the most probable escape path ( mpep ) in the limit of weak noise passes over a hyperbolic equilibrium point ( _ i.e. _ ,  saddle point ) of the unperturbed dynamics . in  the case of non - gradient drift fields exit through an _ unstable _ equilibrium point",
    "can also occur  @xcite .",
    "other new possibilities , such as exit through a limit cycle  @xcite , arise as well .",
    "however , if the unperturbed dynamics are determined by a potential , exit in the limit of weak noise must occur over a hyperbolic equilibrium point , and the asymptotics of the mfpt are given by a classic formula , originally derived in the context of chemical reactions by eyring  @xcite .    over the years",
    "the eyring formula has been rederived and generalized by a variety of alternative approaches  @xcite .",
    "to  illustrate its use , consider a two - dimensional system whose dynamics are specified by a sufficiently smooth drift field @xmath2 symmetric about the @xmath3-axis as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : field ] .",
    "@xmath4 and  @xmath5 denote the stable and hyperbolic equilibrium points , and the barrier lies along the @xmath6-axis .",
    "the position of a point particle representing the system state , moving in this drift field and subjected to additive white noise @xmath7 , satisfies the it stochastic differential equation  @xcite @xmath8 here @xmath9 and  @xmath10 quantify the response of the particle to the perturbations in the @xmath3  and @xmath6-directions ; the corresponding diffusion tensor  @xmath11 is @xmath12 and will in general be anisotropic .",
    "if  the drift field  @xmath13 is obtained from a potential function  @xmath14 by the formula @xmath15 then @xmath13  will in general not be a gradient field , but the relation between @xmath13 and  @xmath16 will ensure detailed balance  @xcite .",
    "if detailed balance holds , the eyring formula for the @xmath17 asymptotics of the mfpt  @xmath18 is @xmath19 \\label{eq:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is @xmath21 evaluated at the stable point  @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is @xmath24 evaluated at the hyperbolic point  @xmath25 , _ etc . _ in  this example the mpep lies along the @xmath3-axis ; this fact was used implicitly in the expression for the arrhenius ( _ i.e. _ ,  exponential ) factor in  ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "if  the vector field were asymmetric and the mpep were curved , the arrhenius factor would involve the integral @xmath26 taken along the mpep  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) displays a frequently encountered feature of weak - noise escape problems : the dependence on  @xmath13 of the pre - exponential factor in the mfpt asymptotics is limited to a dependence on the derivatives of  @xmath13 near the stable and hyperbolic equilibrium points .",
    "if  detailed balance is absent this will generally not be the case  @xcite . however , most quantitative work on the case when detailed balance is absent has dealt with one - dimensional state spaces , due to the difficulty of higher - dimensional computations .",
    "talkner and hnggi  @xcite computed mfpt asymptotics for a multidimensional model of an optically bistable system without detailed balance , in  which the drift field did not arise from a potential .",
    "but due to the simplicity of their model , the prefactor did not display a complicated dependence on the drift .",
    "multidimensional models without detailed balance have not been treated in full generality .    in sections",
    "[ sec : analysis ] and  [ sec : examples ] we start from scratch and compute weak - noise mfpt asymptotics for multidimensional systems by singular perturbation methods , using matched asymptotic expansions .",
    "similar approaches have been used before  @xcite , but our treatment yields a systematic method of computing the pre - exponential factor , even in cases when detailed balance is absent .",
    "as  noted , we  have previously applied our techniques to the nonclassical case of exit over an _",
    "unstable _ equilibrium point ( _ i.e. _ ,  an equilibrium point at which the linearization of  @xmath13 has only positive eigenvalues )  @xcite .",
    "the mfpt asymptotics differed considerably from the classical escape formul  such as eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) ; the prefactor in the asymptotics of  @xmath18 depended on  @xmath27 . in  this paper",
    "we flesh out the ideas in our previous paper by applying them to drift fields with the standard structure of figure  [ fig : field ] .",
    "we  discover that even when the mpep passes over a saddle point , if  detailed balance is absent the mfpt asymptotics likewise differ from those given by the eyring formula .",
    "although the prefactor is independent of  @xmath27 , it  depends on the behavior of  @xmath13 along the entire mpep .",
    "we  quantify this dependence ; it  can be much more complicated than a dependence on the derivatives of  @xmath13 at the endpoints .",
    "our treatment reveals , however , that when @xmath13  is symmetric about the mpep as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : field ] the prefactor can readily be computed by integrating two coupled ordinary differential equations along the mpep .",
    "previous work has left the impression that partial differential equations must be solved . in  the absence of detailed balance ,",
    "the mfpt asymptotics are determined by a _ quasipotential _",
    "@xcite , the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation .",
    "however the derivatives of this function along the mpep , which turn out to determine the prefactor , satisfy ordinary differential equations .",
    "the prefactor is very sensitive to the behavior of the drift field in a neighborhood of the mpep . integrating the ordinary differential equations along the mpep requires knowledge of the extent of ` differential shearing ' along the mpep , _",
    "i.e. _ , knowledge of the second derivatives of  @xmath28 there . in  many cases differential",
    "shearing can give rise to a _ focusing singularity _ along the mpep , in  which case more sophisticated techniques must be used .    when detailed balance is absent , in  the limit of weak noise the short - term dynamics of the system , as  well as the mfpt asymptotics , display novel behavior .",
    "as  noted , the system fluctuates around the locally stable equilibrium state many times before it finally escapes along the mpep .",
    "if  the drift field  @xmath13 arises from a potential , each of the unsuccessful escape attempts follows an outward ` instanton ' trajectory anti - parallel to some integral curve of  @xmath13 and then falls back along the same integral curve ( an  ` anti - instanton ' trajectory ) . in  the absence of detailed balance , the time - irreversibility will generally cause the instanton trajectories _ not _ to be anti - parallel to the anti - instanton trajectories , which remain integral curves of the drift field .",
    "hence unsuccessful escape attempts will proceed with high probability along closed _ loops _ containing nonzero area , in  contrast to the more familiar situation for systems with detailed balance .",
    "we  discuss this in section  [ sec : shorttime ] ; conclusions appear in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we now derive the weak - noise mfpt asymptotics for any  @xmath13 with the general structure of fig .",
    "[ fig : field ] , but not necessarily derived from a potential .",
    "we  allow anisotropic diffusion , so  long as the principal axes of the diffusion tensor are aligned with the mpep .",
    "after approximating the probability density of the system along the mpep , we  will compute @xmath18 by the kramers method of computing the probability flux through the separatrix , _",
    "i.e. _ , the boundary of the basin of attraction of the stable point .",
    "the fokker - planck equation for the probability density @xmath29 is @xmath30 , with @xmath31 if  absorbing boundary conditions are imposed on the separatrix ( in this case , the @xmath6-axis ) , the mfpt in the weak - noise limit may be approximated by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the eigenvalue of the slowest decaying density mode @xmath34 ( _ i.e. _ ,  the eigenfunction of @xmath35 whose eigenvalue has the greatest real part ) .",
    "@xmath33  is negative and converges to zero as @xmath36 , so  in the weak - noise limit @xmath32 displays arrhenius growth .",
    "we  have @xmath37 since the right - hand side is the normalized flux of probability through the separatrix .",
    "the leading asymptotics of  @xmath33 , as  computed by this formula , will be unaffected  @xcite if @xmath34 is taken to satisfy @xmath38 .    according to  ( [ eq:3 ] ) , to approximate @xmath33",
    "we must approximate the normal derivative of @xmath34 along the separatrix .",
    "but since the mpep passes through a hyperbolic point , the probability density will be concentrated in a small region ( of  size @xmath39 ) about this point as @xmath36 .",
    "it  therefore suffices to approximate @xmath34 near the hyperbolic point .",
    "to  evaluate the denominator of  ( [ eq:3 ] ) , we  must also approximate  @xmath34 near the stable point .",
    "the latter approximation is straightforward : near @xmath40 we take @xmath41\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we now write @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for the ( real ) eigenvalues of the drift field linearized at the stable and hyperbolic points , respectively .",

    "physically , @xmath64  measures the transverse lengthscale on which probability density is nonnegligible ; the tube profile will be approximately gaussian , with variance proportional to  @xmath65 at position  @xmath3 .    substituting the _ ansatz _  ( [ eq:6 ] ) into @xmath38 and equating the coefficients of powers of  @xmath27 yields a system of equations for the the functions @xmath66 , @xmath64 ,  @xmath49 in  terms of @xmath67 , @xmath60 ,  @xmath68 .",

    "that these trajectories are directly anti - parallel to each other is a consequence of our assumption that the drift field is symmetric about the @xmath3-axis mpep . since physical exit trajectories begin at the stable point and terminate near the hyperbolic point , when constructing the wkb approximation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) we use the instanton solution @xmath74 rather than the anti - instanton solution @xmath76 .",

    "the outward instanton trajectories are not anti - parallel to the inward anti - instanton trajectories , and the resulting closed loops contain nonzero area .",
    "this is a consequence of time - irreversibility .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] illustrates this phenomenon .",
    "if @xmath108 and the drift field  @xmath13 is given by ( [ eq:20a ] ) and  ( [ eq:20 ] ) with @xmath118 , detailed balance is absent . though the nonequilibrium potential can not be computed explicitly except along the @xmath3-axis , the instanton and anti - instanton trajectories are easily computed numerically .",
    "typical trajectories are shown . that the @xmath3-axis instanton trajectory ( _ i.e. _ ,  the mpep ) is atypical , being directly anti - parallel to the drift , is in part a consequence of the symmetry of our model .",
    "it  is also a consequence of the fact that by ( [ eq : ux ] ) and  ( [ eq : uy ] ) , we  are assuming @xmath153 to hold along the mpep . within the wkb tube of width",
    "@xmath39 about the mpep , to  high accuracy @xmath13  is irrotational and detailed balance holds .",
    "however the small deviations from detailed balance due to differential shearing can , as  we have seen , prevent transverse fluctuations from being in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] also illustrates the phenomenon of focusing : several of the instanton trajectories displayed intersect each other , though not along the mpep .",
    "due  to such intersections ( which typically form _ caustics _  @xcite , or  singular surfaces of codimension unity )",
    "the computation of the nonequilibrium potential  @xmath48 will in general require a minimization over trajectories which are _ piecewise classical _",
    "( with zero energy ) rather than classical .",
    "some preliminary investigations of this effect have been made by graham and tl  @xcite , but it is not yet clear how to handle foci appearing along the mpep . in  our model",
    "it is easily checked that @xmath64  being driven through zero to  @xmath80 is the sign of a focus along the mpep , in  fact of a cusp catastrophe  @xcite .",
    "the appropriate extensions to the wkb approximation are now under study .",
    "note that though our instanton and anti - instanton trajectories are incident on the stable point  @xmath22 and/or the hyperbolic point  @xmath25 , the portion of any trajectory within an @xmath39 distance of either equilibrium point is without physical significance . on  this lengthscale diffusion dominates in the sense that the particle can diffuse from any point to any other within @xmath154  time .",
    "this sheds light on the seeming paradox of the trajectories having infinite transit time . since @xmath143 for anti - instanton trajectories an infinite amount of time",
    "is needed to reach  @xmath22 ; similarly an infinite amount of time is needed for the instanton trajectories to emerge from  @xmath22 .",
    "the physical escape trajectories , both successful and unsuccessful , should be viewed as emerging from the diffusion - dominated zone rather than from  @xmath22 itself .",
    "so  for example any unsuccessful escape trajectory directed along the @xmath3-axis will have transit time @xmath155 the transit time of the return path , _",
    "i.e. _ , the corresponding anti - instanton trajectory , will be the same .",
    "similarly the amount of time needed for the final , successful escape trajectory to approach  @xmath25 will be @xmath156 in  all @xmath157 \\log ( 1/\\epsilon^{1/2 } ) + o(1)\\ ] ] time units will be required for the mpep to be traversed in full during the successful escape .",
    "we  see that there are two timescales : the exponentially large mfpt and the logarithmic timescale on which escape attempts occur . in  the weak - noise limit",
    "the latter is very brief compared to the former ; the number of unsuccessful escape attempts grows exponentially .",
    "the successful escape , when it finally occurs , will on the mfpt timescale occur almost instantaneously ; this justifies the term ` instanton . '",
    "we have seen that even in the absence of detailed balance , the weak - noise mfpt asymptotics of a nonlinear system with a point attractor can readily be computed .",
    "there is no simple expression for the pre - exponential factor in the asymptotics , such as that given by the eyring formula .",
    "rather , it  follows by integrating the differential equations ( [ eq:10 ] ) and  ( [ eq:11 ] ) along the mpep .",
    "this technique clarifies the new phenomena that can occur , such as the formation of focusing singularities due to differential shearing along the mpep .",
    "the effects of these singularities on the mfpt asymptotics will be treated in a future publication .",
    "our treatment makes it clear that the time - irreversibility present in systems without detailed balance manifests itself even unto the shortest time scales .",
    "it  is well known that in  such systems stationary states , and the quasi - stationary state we  employ to compute the mfpt asymptotics , are characterized by a global circulation of probability . however the circulation discussed in section  [ sec : shorttime ] differs from the conventional sort  @xcite in that it occurs locally , at the level of _ individual _ unsuccessful escape attempts .",
    "recognition of this point is essential for a proper computation of the mfpt asymptotics .    in this paper",
    "we have treated the two - dimensional case on account of its simplicity , but our treatment generalizes to higher dimensions .",
    "curved mpeps , diffusion tensors whose principal axes are not aligned with the mpep , and nonconstant diffusion tensors can all be treated by appropriate extensions of the techniques presented here . in  higher - dimensional models , or models with curved mpeps ,",
    "the riccati equation  ( [ eq:10 ] ) must be replaced by a _ matrix _ riccati equation .",
    "this extension is related to a standard result of stochastic control theory  @xcite : the effects of perturbing about optimal trajectories , obtained by solving a hamilton - jacobi equation , can be computed by solving a matrix riccati equation .    most studies of the overdamped escape problem have dealt with time - reversible stochastic models , with detailed balance . this is a reflection of the origins of the escape problem in statistical mechanics , where nonlinear dynamics are usually derived from a potential . in  broader applications of stochastic modelling , which include engineering as well as the biological and social sciences",
    ", there is little reason to expect time - reversibility .",
    "our approach should prove useful in the wider context .",
