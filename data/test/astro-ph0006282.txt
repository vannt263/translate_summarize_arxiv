    "microlensing has become an interesting probe of dark matter in our galaxy .",
    "recent microlensing surveys have indicated that a large fraction of the matter in the galactic halo may be dark objects with masses comparable to those of stars , but have not revealed what these objects might be .",
    "we have detailed how microlensing internal to m31 ( crotts 1992 , gyuk and crotts 2000 ) might be used to test such results and show better how the microlensing matter is distributed in space and as a function of mass .",
    "a survey of small fields in m31 has revealed several such candidate events , at roughly the predicted rate ( crotts & tomaney 1996 ) .",
    "we discuss below what efforts have been required to further verify the microlensing nature of these events .",
    "many papers predict microlensing optical depths @xmath1 in m31 , which should approach @xmath2 , over ten times greater than towards the lmc , but previously none of these works studied variations in halo microlensing optical depth over the face of m31 .",
    "since m31 differs from the galaxy in that many sightlines for microlensing are seen by an observer at earth , the variation of @xmath1 depending on the spatial distribution of microlensing objects should be explored .",
    "originally , crotts & tomaney ( 1996 ) identified six events from the 1995 observing season in m31 ( using the vatican advanced technology 1.8-meter telescope on mt .",
    "graham , arizona ) over @xmath3d covering a 125 arcmin@xmath4 field .",
    "these events were characterized by full - width half - maximum timescales of 10d@xmath5d .",
    "the longer end of this range is troublesome , coinciding with pulsewidths seen in miras and other longterm red variables .",
    "in fact , a mira lightcurve , resembling a symmetric sawtooth in magnitude , with peak - to - valley amplitudes of about 5 magnitudes in the @xmath6 band , appears similar to the lightcurve of a simple ( point - mass , point - source ) microlensing event during its maximum amplification .",
    "furthermore , if the period of a mira is about @xmath7  yr , one must monitor for two m31 seasons beyond ( or preceding ) the peak in the light curve in order to detect another peak , since proximate peaks occur when m31 is not easily observable .",
    "the peak of such a mira has @xmath8d , which would corresponds to lensing masses @xmath9 for typical lensing geometries in our survey region . hence mira - like variables are troublesome contributors to a potential false event rate , and require multiple seasons of observations in order to be eliminated .",
    "we have performed two tests of these six original candidates : 1 ) constructing well - sampled lightcurves over the m31 seasons of the three subsequent years ( through 1998 ) , and 2 ) obtaining @xmath10 wfpc2 snapshot observations of these sources in order to determine if their colors are consistent with mira - like variables .",
    "( the latter test is impossible from the ground , since crowding does not allow one to resolve typical sources in average seeing conditions .",
    "variable sources are made to appear isolated from one another by virtue of image subtraction e.g.  tomaney & crotts [ 1996 ] ) .",
    "the result of these two event filters is to eliminate three of the six events , with the remainder firmly inconsistent with mira - like variables . for the remaining events , now that we have measured their baseline magnitudes from wfpc2 images , we can calculate a more accurate peak amplification ( assuming that the lensing mass rests as close as possible along the sightline to the core of m31 ) .",
    "these persist with estimates for the lensing masses in the range @xmath11 , with two events possible arising from stars in m31 s bulge , but one almost certainly not a bulge lens , given its source position 2.5  kpc out into the disk .",
    "given the robust nature of some of the candidate microlensing events from the small area survey discussed above , it is worth considering possible results of a larger , wide - angle survey , especially since the advent of ccd imagers covering large fractions of a square degree .",
    "we present here representative results simulating a survey in which roughly 0.5 square degree is imaged for two hours every night on a two - meter telescope , in 1-arcsec seeing , requiring each event to be sampled at the 4@xmath12 level over at least 3 day timescales .",
    "the event rate predicted for such a survey is large e.g.  figure 1 , which shows the predicted distribution of events over the field containing our survey area , for a typical model with 50% of the halo dark matter composed of 0.5  m@xmath13 microlensing masses .",
    "the halo fraction , halo flattening ( @xmath14 ) and core radius ( @xmath15 ) are allowed to vary between models , and then a maximum likelihood calculation is performed to yield resulting values for these parameters .",
    "these parameters can result in large changes in the distribution of microlensing optical depth across the face of m31 ( see figure 2 ) , which significantly affects the distribution of microlensing event detections .",
    "our calculations show that this larger survey might easily observe @xmath0100 such events per m31 observing season , which would allow the shape of a strong microlensing halo of m31 to be mapped .",
    "since most masses reside near where the sightline passes the center of the galaxy , at a known source - lens distance , this survey would also allow a more exact determination of the masses doing the lensing .",
    "selected fields in m31 might also serve as independent sightlines through the halo of our galaxy .",
    "the preliminary epochs for a large survey in m31 , over one - half square degree , have already been obtained , initiating the project mega : microlensing exploration of the galaxy and andromeda .    our ability to measure @xmath15 and @xmath14 depend on the true value of @xmath15 , with small values providing greater @xmath1 in the galaxy s center , where more sources exist .",
    "all models produce @xmath16100 events per season , with small @xmath15 models producing more .",
    "after three seasons , @xmath15 can be measured to within @xmath01.5  kpc ( 1@xmath12 ) , and @xmath14 to @xmath00.1 ( for @xmath17  kpc ) , or @xmath02.5  kpc and @xmath00.2 , respectively for @xmath18  kpc . with @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "well - constrained , the data allow a superior estimate of lens mass distribution .",
    "this many events can result from a campaign using existing wide - field ccd arrays on two - meter@xmath19 class telescopes .",
    "figure 3 shows the fields being covered by mega on some of the telescopes being used , compared to the fields for the earlier vatt / columbia survey ( described below ) .",
    "we have initiated this effort ( mega ) by establishing long baselines eliminating long - period variables , having obtained several epochs of such data in 1997 and 1998 , and having begun more intensive observations in 1999 to detect microlensing events across much of m31 over the course of several seasons . at the time of the meeting , we have found approximately 40000 variables in the int wfc data ( some consistent with microlensing ) , which implies a sample of some 50000 when kpno and mdm fields are included .",
    "( int data are being collected in cooperation with agape - see kerins , this volume . )",
    "considerable improvements can be made in estimating halo shape parameters , as well as the microlens mass , if einstein crossing times @xmath20 can be measured for events .",
    "since the densest portion of the halo should sit over the bulge of m31 , the lens - source distance is constrained by noting the impact parameter of the line of sight to the source relative to m31 s center .",
    "hence , @xmath20 can be converted , roughly , to a mass , at a much greater accuracy than in the lmc sightline situation .",
    "furthermore , events that are due to halo lenses have preferentially longer @xmath20 than confusing bulge events , hence measurements of @xmath20 can lead to better determination of halo shape parameters beyond those accuracies quoted above .",
    "the einstein crossing time can be measured in two ways , the @xmath21 method of baltz and silk ( 2000 ) , and by using @xmath10 imaging to determine baseline magnitudes by resolving the source star . as we showed at the meeting ,",
    "neither of these is sufficiently reliable by itself to determine @xmath20 without a large fraction of outlying measurements , either due to misidentification of source stars in @xmath10 images , or poor @xmath22 in the wings of microlensing lightcurves , where @xmath21 is determined .",
    "however , if a large field ( @xmath23 deg@xmath4 ) is imaged with @xmath10/acs , requiring @xmath0 15 orbits , both methods will be available ( @xmath21 from ground - based data ) , leading to @xmath20 for @xmath24 events , constraining the average microlensing mass to @xmath25m@xmath13 or better , and significantly improving halo shape parameter determinations .",
    "uglesich , crotts and tomaney conducted a preliminary survey of two 125 arcmin@xmath4 fields using the vatt 1.8 m and mdm 1.3 m .",
    "data are reduced using the difference image photometry method of tomaney and crotts ( 1996 ) , and example of which is shown in figure 4 for typical mdm 1.3 m images .",
    "the @xmath22 ratio in these difference images is limited by photon shot noise , not seeing fluctuations , as evidenced in several studies e.g.  uglesich et al .",
    "quantities of data sufficient to find microlensing events for masses in the 0.1 - 1m@xmath13 range where obtained in late 1995 through early 1999 , with the best temporal coverage in the 1998 - 1999 season .",
    "most of these data are now reduced , with the final season now having been searched for possible microlensing events .",
    "there are still @xmath020 epochs to be added from additional observatories , but already 11 potential events have been found , with 8 sampled over the peak of the best - fit microlensing curve , and points on either side .",
    "these 8 candidate events are shown in figure 5 .",
    "( at the time of the meeting , we had only fit these with the high - amplification microlensing curve fit of gould [ 1997 ] , rather than the full parameter range implicit in general point - mass , point - lens microlensing curves of paczynski [ 1986 ] . )",
    "these sources have also been monitored in previous years data , and have maintained a stable baseline , inconsistent with longterm variables e.g.  miras .",
    "we expect a large number of events to be found in this season s and other season s data .",
    "the vatt / columbia survey has the potential for sensing the asymmetry in microlensing events across the face of m31 , as seen in figure 2 , if a halo microlensing population actually exists as a significant fraction of the dark matter in spiral galaxy halos .",
