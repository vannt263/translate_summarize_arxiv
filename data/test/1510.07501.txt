    "the story of the axion begins at the dawn of qcd , circa mid-1970s@xcite . with two light quarks ,",

    "the price to pay was that the qcd lagrangian should contain a term of the form f_a_a^ .",

    "[ eq : lqcd ] constitutes the famous strong cp problem .",
    "while a variety of solutions to the strong cp problem have been proposed , one stands out for its simplicity and elegance : the peccei - quinn ( pq ) solution@xcite .",

    "a new goldstone field , the _ axion _ , arises in accord with goldstone s theorem .",

    "the axion field settles dynamically to its minimum at @xmath17 and the offending term goes to zero : the strong @xmath13 problem is solved ! as a consequence of this solution , a physical axion particle should exist with mass@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 . in the original proposal pq suggested the scale @xmath20 , a value which was soon ruled out by reactor and beam dump experiments . ksvz@xcite and",

    "in spite of the fact that axions are extremely weakly coupled their coupling strength is suppressed by @xmath21 they still can play the role of cold dark matter .",
    "the equation of motion for the axion field @xmath22 in the early universe is given by + 3h(t)+=0 with @xmath23 .",

    "admx has been upgraded with a new dilution refrigerator and squid electronics and hopes to explore more broadly and deeply in @xmath35 vs. @xmath36 parameter space in the near future .",
    "expectations for an axion signal are model dependent .",
    "two commonly used models include ksvz which introduced intermediate mass scale pq charged heavy quark fields @xmath37 or the dfsz model wherein two",

    "the admx experiment has reached sensitivity to axions in the ksvz model but at present is short of the dfsz coupling strength .",
    "while much of the previous discussion is based on long - known results , the biggest recent development in axion physics is .... the discovery of the higgs boson with @xmath39 gev@xcite .",
    "the issue here is that the higgs boson exists and appears very much sm - like and as a fundamental scalar field . if one then expands the sm to include axions via _",
    "e.g. _ the ksvz or dfsz model , then one would expect the higgs mass to blow up to @xmath40 scale . of course , one can always fine - tune @xmath41 to @xmath42 but such tuning is generally symptomatic of some missing ingredient in the model .",
    "this electroweak fine - tuning crisis is elegantly solved via the introduction of supersymmetry where the offending quadratic divergences to scalar field masses all neatly cancel .",

    "nonetheless , it has alarmed many theorists that susy matter states have not be found at lhc8 searches . however , many other theorists expected a rather high value of soft breaking scale @xmath45 since it offers a decoupling solution to the susy flavor and cp problems and is in accord with the gravitino problem for gravitino mass @xmath46 tev@xcite .",
    "the enigma is the connection of the susy breaking scale to the weak scale : @xmath47 gev @xmath48 tev .",
    "this is the emerging little hierarchy problem .",
    "it requires a scrutinization of naturalness measures .",
    "while simple evaluations of large logs or barbieri - giudice naturalness @xmath49 pointed to high fine - tuning , the methodology used in these measures has been criticized@xcite in that they neglect _ dependent contributions of opposite - sign _ which lead to large cancellations .",
    "a proper evaluation of fine - tuning allows for tev - scale highly mixed 3rd generation squarks but does require light higgsinos @xmath50 of mass @xmath51 gev , the lighter the better .",
    "the lightest higgsino @xmath52 is the lsp but is thermally underproduced as wimp dark matter with typically @xmath53 .",
    "the light higgsino spectrum is compressed with inter - higgsino mass gaps of @xmath54 gev so that higgsino decay products are soft and are buried under qcd backgrounds at lhc@xcite . the only soft susy breaking term required to be near @xmath55 is @xmath56 .",
    "this term can be driven radiatively to small instead of large negative values at the weak scale in models with non - universal higgs soft masses at the gut scale .",
    "such models are those with radiatively - driven naturalness or rns@xcite .    by requiring susy to solve the ew naturalness problem and pq symmetry to solve the qcd naturalness ( strong cp ) problem ,",
    "then the axion becomes but one element of the axion superfield .",
    "it is now accompanied by the spin-0 @xmath57-parity - even saxion @xmath58 and the spin-@xmath59 @xmath57-parity - odd axino @xmath60 . in gravity - mediated susy breaking models , it is expected that @xmath61@xcite . in such a case ,",
    "then dark matter is composed of two particles : the susy wimp and the axion .",
    "the presence of axions in weak scale susy models offers an important and elegant solution to the susy mu problem .",
    "since the @xmath62 term occurs in the superpotential ( it is supersymmetric and not susy breaking ) one expects naively its value to be @xmath63 ( the planck scale ) while phenomenology / naturalness require @xmath64 gev . kim and nilles recognized@xcite that the supersymmetrized dfsz axion model offers a solution to the mu problem .",
    "the mu term is first forbidden because it violates pq symmetry but then it is regenerated via the dfsz coupling @xmath65 where the pq field @xmath66 develops a vev @xmath67 under pq breaking .",
    "then ~_f_a^2/m_p while @xmath68 .",
    "the little hierarchy with @xmath69 is just a reflection of a mis - match between pq breaking scale and hidden sector mass scale @xmath70 .",
    "such a mis - match can arise in models such as the msy model of radiatively - driven pq breaking@xcite . in the msy model ,",
    "susy breaking effects @xmath71 drive one of the pq fields to negative squared mass causing pq symmetry to break much as ew symmetry is broken radiatively due to the large top quark yukawa coupling . minimizing the pq scalar potential , then one typically finds @xmath51 gev is induced by @xmath72 tev@xcite : the mu problem is solved and the little hierarchy is explained ! the pq breaking scale @xmath16 sets the mass for the axion , the higgs and the higgsinos ! in addition , majorana masses are induced for right - hand neutrinos . while this behavior is exhibited for the msy model , it seems typical of a much larger class of models .",
    "susy models with radiatively driven naturalness and with a supersymmetrized dfsz axion solution are natural in both the ew and qcd sectors , can accommodate @xmath73 gev with tev - scale highly mixed stops and can evade lhc8 searches .",

    "<S> the strong cp problem of qcd is at heart a problem of naturalness : why is the @xmath0 term highly suppressed in the qcd lagrangian when it seems necessary to explain why there are three and not four light pions ? </S>",
    "<S> the most elegant solution posits a spontaneously broken peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry which requires the existence of the axion field @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the axion field settles to the minimum of its potential thus removing the offensive term but giving rise to the physical axion whose coherent oscillations can make up the cold dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> only now are experiments such as admx beginning to explore qcd axion parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> since a bonafide scalar particle the higgs boson has been discovered , one might expect its mass to reside at the axion scale @xmath2 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs mass is elegantly stabilized by supersymmetry : in this case the axion is accompanied by its axino and saxion superpartners . </S>",
    "<S> requiring naturalness also in the electroweak sector implies higgsino - like wimps so then we expect mixed axion - wimp dark matter </S>",
    "<S> . ultimately we would expect detection of both an axion and a wimp while signals for light higgsinos may show up at lhc and must show up at ilc . </S>"
