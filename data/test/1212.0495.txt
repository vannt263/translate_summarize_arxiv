    "the investigation of the effects of the interplay between discreteness and nonlinearity is a long - standing argument of research in the study of the dynamical properties of nonlinear lattice models @xcite .",
    "a typical feature exhibited by nonlinear classical hamiltonian lattices is the existence of discrete breathers , i.e. time - periodic and space - localized solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "the study of their dynamical stability , as well as their robustness in long transient processes and thermal equilibrium , has been the subject of an intense experimental and theoretical work @xcite .",
    "the interplay between discreteness and nonlinearity is also crucial for the occurrence of modulational instabilities ( mi ) , well known in the theory of nonlinear media @xcite .",
    "mi are dynamical instabilities characterized by an exponential growth of arbitrarily small fluctuations resulting from the combined effect of dispersion and nonlinearity .",
    "the occurrence of modulational instabilities has been studied in a number of physical systems , ranging from fluid dynamics @xcite to nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "the role and the consequences of the mi in the dynamics of discrete systems have been extensively studied : the mi was discussed in the context of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnlse ) @xcite , which is a paradigmatic lattice model @xcite used to study nonlinear discrete dynamics @xcite .",
    "the dnlse is commonly used to describe the effective dynamics in different physical systems of interest , including the dynamics of ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite and optical waveguide arrays @xcite . for ultracold bosons in optical lattices the onset of mi was analytically predicted @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite , and in nonlinear waveguide arrays the experimental observation of the mi was also reported @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the occurrence of mi in the dnlse in the presence of non - local long - range hoppings and interactions .",
    "a motivation for such a study comes from experiments with ultracold dipolar bosonic gases @xcite which have been bose condensed recently by several groups @xcite , from the attainment of quantum degeneration for ensembles of polar molecules @xcite , and from the recent experimental investigations of strongly interacting rydberg gases @xcite . since the interaction potential in ( di)polar gases decay as a power law @xmath11 ( for rydberg gases interacting through van der waals interactions as @xmath12 ) , recent experiments with dipolar gases in optical lattices @xcite , as well as the realization of long - lived dipolar molecules in a three - dimensional periodic potential @xcite and in perspective the dynamics of rydberg atoms in optical lattices @xcite , open the possibility to study dnlse with non - local interactions .",
    "our other motivation is related to the wide interest in systems with long - range interactions @xcite . in these systems",
    "the range of interaction of the constitutive units is not bounded . a typical form of interactions , relevant for a number of systems ranging from gravitational ones to dipolar magnets and gases , is provided by the power - law decay @xmath13 ( e.g. for gravitational systems @xmath14 ) where @xmath15 is the distance among the constituents . for statistical mechanics models ,",
    "like the ising or more generally the @xmath16 models , the possibility to have power - law couplings makes possible the appearance of a rich phase diagram @xcite .    a first criterion to determine the long - rangedness of a system with power - law decaying interaction is the comparison with the dimension @xmath17 of the space ;",
    "as @xmath18 is smaller than or equal to @xmath17 , if the system is homogeneous and the interaction favours homogeneity we obtain a diverging energy density , thus to obtain a well defined thermodynamic limit ( if relevant ) a rescaling of the energy is in order ( the so called kac rescaling ) @xcite . in the following",
    "we will refer to this region as the non - extensive long - range region .",
    "if @xmath18 is larger than @xmath17 the energy of the system is extensive and it is normal to individuate a value of @xmath18 , which we denote by @xmath19 , such that for @xmath20 the system behaves as a short - range system . since it is @xmath21 , there is a region of values of @xmath18 , given by @xmath22 , in which the behavior of the system significantly differs from the properties of the same system with short - range interactions , although the energy is extensive .",
    "such a region is the extensive long - range region , also referred to as the weak - long - range region @xcite , where `` weak '' refers to the extensivity of the energy .",
    "the actual value of @xmath19 depends on the specific model and the dimension : for @xmath16 models in @xmath23 it is @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "both the thermodynamics and the dynamics of long - range interacting systems are extremely interesting @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the long - range region the dynamical evolution evidences that the system may stay in a quasi - stationary metastable state ( different from the thermal equilibrium one ) for a time exponentially growing with the size of the system .",
    "such a metastable state is reached after a short - time dynamics , referred to as violent relaxation @xcite .",
    "while the main bodies of the studies on the dynamics of nonlinear lattices have dealt with short - ranged systems , the extensions of these results to long - ranged systems appeared in the literature addressing the properties of discrete systems with different kinds of non - local dispersion or non - local nonlinear interaction we mentioned @xcite and focused on the existence and stability of localized excitations ( for a recent review on nonlinear waves in lattices see @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study how modulational instabilities emerge in nonlinear lattices with non - local interactions and hoppings , aiming both at unveiling if ( and in which conditions ) short time dynamical instabilities occur in nonlinear lattices and at clarifying the nature of the emerging modulational instability .",
    "we choose the dnlse as a case study not only due to its paradigmatic usefulness , but also due to its relation with @xmath25 [ i.e. , @xmath26 models : when the fluctuation of the number of particles are frozen , the kinetic term in the dnlse energy is basically the @xmath25 model ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ the_model ] ) .",
    "this is the reason why we choose to consider not only power - law interactions ( as it is relevant for experiments with ultracold dipolar bosons in optical lattices ) , but also power - law hoppings [ which corresponds to power - law couplings in @xmath27 models ] . using the dnlse we study the modulationally stable and unstable regions in the presence of power - law non - local interactions and hoppings , discussing also the interplay between local and non - local interactions , e.g. local attraction and non - local repulsion .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ the_model ] , we introduce the dnlse with long - range hoppings and interactions and discuss its relation with other statistical mechanics models . in sec .",
    "[ mi_analysis ] we derive the bogoliubov spectrum of elementary excitations , present the general framework for the determination of the stability regions in presence of power - law interactions and hoppings and specialize it to the analysis to the short - range limit reminding the known results of the mi analysis @xcite .",

    "if the interactions are sufficiently long - ranged it is possible to have a phase transition at finite temperature between a ferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase @xcite even for @xmath23 : if @xmath61 , then the critical temperature @xmath62 is vanishing ( as in any short - range ising chain @xcite ) , while for @xmath63 the energy is non - extensive .",

    "we observe that the dnlse hamiltonian can be written as the sum of a kinetic term @xmath67 and an interaction term @xmath68 .",
