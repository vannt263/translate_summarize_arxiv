    "measurements of the deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons and nucleons , @xmath2 , allow the extraction of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) which describe the longitudinal momentum carried by the quarks , anti - quarks and gluons that make up the fast - moving nucleons . while pdfs provide crucial input to perturbative quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) calculations of processes involving hadrons , they do not provide a complete picture of the partonic structure of nucleons . in particular , pdfs contain neither information on the correlations between partons nor on their transverse motion .",
    "hard exclusive processes , in which the nucleon remains intact , have emerged in recent years as prime candidates to complement this essentially one dimentional picture .",
    "the simplest exclusive process is the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) or exclusive production of real photon , @xmath3 .",
    "this process is of particular interest as it has both a clear experimental signature and is calculable in perturbative qcd .",
    "the dvcs reaction can be regarded as the elastic scattering of the virtual photon off the proton via a colourless exchange , producing a real photon in the final state @xcite . in the bjorken scaling regime , qcd calculations assume that the exchange involves two partons , having different longitudinal and transverse momenta , in a colourless configuration . these unequal momenta or skewing",
    "are a consequence of the mass difference between the incoming virtual photon and the outgoing real photon .",
    "this skewedness effect can be interpreted in the context of generalised parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite or dipole model @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we examine the most recent data recorded from the desy @xmath0 collider at hera and their implication on the quarks / gluons imaging of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "the first measurements of dvcs cross section have been realised at hera within the h1 and zeus experiments @xcite .",
    "these results are given in the specific kinematic domain of both experiments , at low @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) but they take advantage of the large range in @xmath6 , offered by the hera kinematics , which covers more than 2 orders of magnitude , from @xmath7 to @xmath8 gev@xmath9 .",
    "it makes possible to study the transition from the low @xmath6 non - perturbative region ( around @xmath7 gev@xmath9 ) towards higher values of @xmath6 where the higher twists effects are lowered ( above @xmath10 gev@xmath9 ) .",

    "a very fundamental observation is the steep @xmath12 dependence in @xmath13 , visible on fig .",

    "let s discuss in more details the colour dipole model .",
    "indeed , this approach provides a simple unified picture of inclusive and diffractive processes and enables hard and soft physics to be incorporated in a single dynamical framework . at high energies , in the proton s rest frame",
    ", the virtual photon fluctuates into a hadronic system ( the simplest of which is a @xmath14 dipole ) a long distance upstream of the target proton .",
    "the formation time of this hadronic system , and of the subsequent formation of the hadronic final state , is much longer than the interaction time with the target .",
    "dvcs is a good probe of the transition between soft and hard regimes in the dipole model for two reasons .",
    "indeed , the transverse photon wave function can select large dipoles , even for large @xmath15 , and certainly for the @xmath6 range @xmath16 gev@xmath9 . also , because the final photon is real , dvcs is more sensitive to large dipoles than dis at the same @xmath6 . then , in the colour dipole approach , the dis ( or dvcs ) process can be seen as a succession in time of three factorisable subprocesses : i ) the virtual photon fluctuates in a quark - antiquark pair , ii ) this colour dipole interacts with the proton target , iii ) the quark pair annihilates into a virtual ( or real ) photon .",
    "the imaginary part of the dis ( or dvcs ) amplitude at @xmath17 is expressed in the simple way @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the light cone photon wave functions for transverse and longitudinal photons .",

    "the transition to saturation occurs when @xmath40 becomes comparable to @xmath41 .",
    "an important feature of dipole models that incorporate saturation is that the total cross section can be expressed as a function of the single variable @xmath42 :    @xmath43    this property , called geometric scaling , has already been observed to hold for the total @xmath0 dis cross section and in diffractive processes @xcite ( see fig .",

    "it has also recently been addressed in the context of exclusive processes including dvcs and extended to cases with non - zero momentum transfer to the proton @xcite .",

    "a major experimental achievement of h1 and zeus @xcite has been the measurement of dvcs cross sections , differential in @xmath44 , the momentum transfer ( squared ) at the proton vertex . a good description of @xmath45 by a fit of the form @xmath46",

    "this result is consistent with perturbative qcd calculations in terms of a radiation cloud of gluons and quarks emitted around the incoming virtual photon .",
    "the fact the perturbative qcd calculations provide correct descriptions of @xmath47 measurements ( see previous section ) is a proof that they deal correctly this this non - trivial aspect of the proton ( spatial ) structure .",
    "as already discussed in the context of dipole models , the modeling of the correlation between the spatial transverse structure and the longitudinal momenta distributions of partons in the proton is one major challenge also for the gpds approach . in fig .",

    ", width=226 ]    another natural way to address the problem of the correlation between @xmath35 and @xmath33 kinematical variables proceeds from a determination of a cross section asymmetry with respect to the beam charge .",

    "this result represents a major experimental progress and is challenging for models ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "let s note that models of gpds can use present hera data at low @xmath4 , as well as jlab and hermes data at larger @xmath4 ( @xmath66 ) , in order to provide a first global understanding of exclusive real photon production @xcite .",
    "however , as already mentioned above , some efforts have still to be made in the intermediate @xmath4 domain .",
    "feasabilities for future beam charge asymmetry ( bca ) measurements at compass have been studied extensively in the last decade @xcite .",
    "compass is a fixed target experiment which can use 100 gev muon beams and hydrogen targets , and then access experimentaly the dvcs process @xmath67 .",
    "the bca can be determined when using positive and negative muon beams .",
    "one major interest is the kinematic coverage from @xmath68 gev@xmath9 till @xmath69 gev@xmath9 in @xmath6 and @xmath4 ranging from @xmath70 till @xmath71 .",
    "it means that it is possible to avoid the kinematic domain dominated by higher - twists and non - perturbative effects ( for @xmath72 gev@xmath9 ) and keeping a @xmath4 range which is extending the hera ( h1/zeus ) domain . as mentioned above , this is obviously an essential measurement to cover the full kinematic range and give some results in the intermediate @xmath4 range between h1/zeus and jlab / hermes experiments .",

    "[ compass2 ] due to the fact that @xmath73 is taken to be large ( @xmath74 gev@xmath75 ) in simulations .",
    "if it happens to be much smaller , as measured at low @xmath4 by h1 @xcite , both predictions for bca in fig .",
    "[ compass2 ] would be of similar shape , as both curves would converge to the factorised case .",
    "this shows clearly the high level of sensitivity of this experimental quantity on the modeling of gpds .",
    "this makes this observable very interesting and challenging for gpds models in the future , once these measurements at cern would be realised in 2011/2012 .",
    "dvcs measurements in the hera kinematics at low @xmath4 ( @xmath65 ) are well described by recent gpds models , which also describe correctly measurements at larger values of @xmath4 in the jlab kinematics .",
    "dvcs measurements in the hera kinematics are also nicely described within a dipole approach , which encodes the non - forward kinematics for dvcs only through the different weights coming from the photon wavefunctions .",
    "recently , h1 and zeus experiments have also shown that proton tomography at low @xmath4 enters into the experimental domain of high energy physics , with a first experimental evidence that gluons are located at the periphery of the proton . a new frontier in understanding this structure would be possible at cern within the compass experimental setup .",
