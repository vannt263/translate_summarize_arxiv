    "a fundamental problem of statistical mechanics is the determination and understanding of classical ground states of many - particle systems - the zero - temperature particle arrangement that minimizes potential energy per particle .",

    "a disordered many - particle system is one that lacks long - range order .",
    "more precisely , disordered systems have a pair correlation function @xmath0 ( defined below ) that decays to unity faster than @xmath1 , for spatial dimension @xmath2 and some positive @xmath3 , in the infinite - volume limit .",
    "@xcite recently , a collective coordinate approach has been used to identify certain possibly disordered ground states .",
    "@xcite although the previous studies are suggestive of the relation between disordered ground states and collective coordinates for finite systems , a systematic investigation of disordered ground states , including whether they exist in the infinite - volume limit , is not yet available .    in this paper",
    ", we use an `` inverse '' approach to construct classical disordered ground states with precisely tuned wave scattering characteristics via the aforementioned collective coordinate procedure . in a recent example of a `` forward '' problem ,",
    "the scattering from glass ceramics with nanometer - sized crystals was likened to that of random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) of hard spheres , @xcite a well - known , disordered many - body configuration .",
    "@xcite these ceramics are of interest in photonics applications because they are mechanically rigid and nearly suppress all scattering at long wavelengths .",
    "@xcite    by contrast , our method utilizes an inverse approach : we prescribe scattering characteristics ( _ e.g. , _ absolute transparency ) and construct many - body configurations that give rise to these targeted characteristics .",
    "potential applications include designing ground - state materials as radiation filters or scatterers , and materials transparent to specific wavelengths of radiation , among others .",
    "we apply our methodology initially for structureless ( i.e. , point ) particles .",
    "however , it could be generalized to structured particles , colloids , or as bodies using the appropriate structure factors for finite - sized particles as is done for random media .",
    "@xcite    since previous studies utilized small periodic systems , @xcite we first establish that systematically increasing the system size has no effect on the degree of disorder .",
    "extrapolation from these results indicates that the constructed configurations remain disordered in the infinite - volume limit ; a seemingly counterintuitive proposition .",
    "we then construct disordered ground states with special scattering properties : `` stealth materials , '' `` super - ideal gases , '' and `` equi - luminous materials . ''",
    "we use the term `` stealth '' materials to refer to many - particle configurations that completely suppress scattering of incident radiation for a set of wave vectors , and thus , are transparent at these wavelengths .",
    "@xcite periodic ( i.e. , crystalline ) configurations are , by definition , `` stealthy '' since they suppress scattering for all wavelengths except those associated with bragg scattering .",
    "however , we construct disordered stealth configurations that prevent scattering only at prescribed wavelengths with no restrictions on any other wavelengths .    we define a `` super - ideal '' gas as a single many - particle configuration whose scattering _ exactly _ matches that of an ensemble of ideal gas configurations , or poisson point distributions , for a set of wave vectors .",
    "a super - ideal gas has a structure factor that is identically unity for specified wave vectors , and thus , this single configuration would be impossible to differentiate from an ensemble of ideal gas configurations for the specified wave vectors .",
    "we define an `` equi - luminous '' material to be a system whose scattering is constant for a set of wavelengths .",
    "although stealth materials and super - ideal gases are subsets of equi - luminescent materials , we use this term to refer to materials that scatter radiation more intensely relative to an ideal gas . these materials that scatter radiation much more intensely than an ideal gas for a set of wave vectors have enhanced density fluctuations and show local clustering similar to polymers and aggregating colloids .",
    "@xcite typically , scattering experiments on these systems are used to shed light on the characteristic length scales of a system.@xcite with our inverse procedure , we impose the degree of clustering by tuning the scattering characteristics for certain wavelengths .    upon generating ensembles of ground - state configurations for each class of materials described above ,",
    "we characterize local order of each ensemble .",
    "we place emphasis on pair information in real space via the pair correlation function @xmath0 and in reciprocal space through the structure factor @xmath4 as these functions are experimentally accessible and used widely in many - body theories .",
    "@xcite    the pair correlation function @xmath0 is the normalized two - particle probability density function @xmath5 and is proportional to the probability of observing a particle center at @xmath6 relative to a particle at the origin.@xcite for a statistically homogeneous and isotropic medium , the pair correlation function @xmath0 depends only on the magnitude of @xmath7 , and is commonly referred to as the radial distribution function @xmath8 , which henceforth is the designation used in this paper .",

    "several inverse methods have sought to construct systems using pair information in real space , particularly in addressing the question of pair correlation function `` realizability,''@xcite which asks whether a given pair correlation function , at number density @xmath20 , can be realized by spatial arrangements of particles .",
    "typically , in real space , a `` target '' radial distribution function is chosen and many - particle configurations are found that best match the target @xmath8 .",
    "stochastic optimization techniques have been a popular reconstruction method in finding spatial arrangements of particles that best approximate a target correlation function.@xcite    in contrast to these real - space methods , we target pair information in reciprocal space to construct configurations whose structure factor _ exactly _ matches the candidate structure factor for a set of wavelengths . in addition , our procedure guarantees that the resulting configuration is a ground - state structure for a class of potential functions .",

    "the `` crystal problem '' has attempted to determine the fundamental mechanism that forces particles into ordered states , but the existence of these mechanisms has yet to be fully understood .",
    "@xcite the notion of disordered ground states is particularly mysterious because of the lack of symmetry , lack of long - range order , and degeneracy of ground - state configurations .",
    "the characterization of order in solid phases in the low - temperature limit has been well studied . in addressing the crystal problem ,",
    "it has been suggested that nonanalyticity of thermodynamic functions may yield `` turbulent , '' or nonperiodic , gibbs states at positive temperature .",

    "turbulent crystals have been examined previously @xcite and evidence has been presented that at low temperature , equilibrium states may contain disorder . @xcite theoretical work has created classical lattice models with short - range interactions whose ground states contain the property of disorder .",
    "@xcite in addition , a simple gradient model was used to develop a disordered state , a labyrinth , within a pattern forming system .",
    "although this state was ultimately excluded from being a ground state , the authors were unable to exclude other models as potentially yielding disordered ground states .",
    "@xcite despite significant research attention , understanding of the attainability of disordered configurations as classical grounds states is incomplete .",
    "we choose to limit this investigation to the study of stealth materials , super - ideal gases , and equi - luminous materials based on the potential applications and fundamental interest .",
    "constructing systems with transparency at specified wavelengths , including wavelengths outside of the low-@xmath23 region , is the primary motivation .",
    "a stealth material has a structure factor that is exactly zero for some set of wavelengths . in the low-@xmath23 limit",
    ", several disordered systems nearly suppress all scattering , though most are not ground states .",
    "for example , when crystallizing hard colloidal spheres , stacking faults of close - packed layers create deviation from perfect crystallinity .",
    "the structure factor is nearly zero in the low-@xmath23 region followed by a strong bragg peak and a diffuse peak before decaying to unity .",
    "@xcite    the examples of stealth configurations can also be described as `` hyperuniform . ''",

    "`` equi - luminous '' describes materials that scatter light equally intensely for a set of wave vectors .",

    ", we focus on materials whose structure factor is a constant greater than unity , as these systems show strong local clustering and intense scattering relative to an ideal gas .",
