    "neutrino experiments offer opportunities for new discoveries and , occasionally , total surprises .",
    "examples of new physics include sterile neutrinos and additional degrees of freedom in the energy density of the universe .",
    "even though it is premature to motivate future facilities on the basis of present indications ( which include some hints from short - baseline experiments @xcite and reactor data @xcite ) , recent developments underscore the possibility of unexpected discoveries , supporting the construction of neutrino facilities with the widest science reach .",
    "icecube is such a facility @xcite .",
    "icecube measures the flux of atmospheric muons and neutrinos with high statistics in a high - energy range that has not been previously explored .",
    "the procedure is simply to compare data with expectations based on the extrapolation of lower - energy data .",
    "any deviation observed is an opportunity for discovery in astrophysics or the physics of the neutrinos themselves .",
    "the potential of icecube to detect ev - mass sterile neutrinos has been recognized for some time @xcite .",
    "the problem has been revisited @xcite with the measurement of the atmospheric neutrino flux in the energy range 100gev400tev with unprecedented statistics , taken when icecube was half complete @xcite .",
    "the signature for sterile neutrinos is the disappearance of @xmath1 resulting from mixing with a new species during propagation between production and detection . for @xmath0 ,",
    "resonant oscillations are expected in icecube for tev atmospheric neutrinos at characteristic zenith angles .",
    "an additional signature is the appearance of an excess of @xmath2 , with a particular energy and zenith dependence , due to a sterile neutrino acting as an intermediary between muon and electron neutrinos .    however , before addressing the question of whether the data support evidence for a sterile neutrino , we are investigating the consistency between the data and expectation and the correctness of the model implemented in simulation .",
    "given the high statistics , the focus is on the systematics of the experiment .",
    "the systematic issues are being studied with renewed emphasis ; up to now , our priority has been the search for neutrino sources beyond the atmosphere , analyses where the simulation of the background is done using the data themselves .",
    "we discuss the status of this effort that will also result in improved sensitivity to , for instance , diffuse limits on cosmic neutrinos .",
    "figure  [ cos_zen ] compares the observed to the predicted distribution of atmospheric @xmath3 ( plus @xmath4 ) from data taken while icecube operated in a partially completed 40-string configuration . since the uncertainty in the normalization is large ( see ref .",

    "this plot is similar to fig .",
    "19 of ref . 11 , except shape uncertainties are included for the predicted flux .",
    "these shape uncertainties include contributions from uncertainty in the ratio of pions to kaons produced by the cosmic ray flux , uncertainties in the spectral slope of the cosmic ray flux , and uncertainties in the simulation of dom sensitivity and ice properties .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion of systematic uncertainties associated with atmospheric neutrino measurements with the 40-string icecube detector . some of these uncertainties will be reduced as the detector and irreducible systematic uncertainties are better understood .",

    "while these effects have some impact on the zenith distribution , we have found that an important change arose from improvements in the modeling of the rock layer below the detector and the ice / rock boundary , as well as the assignment of event weights according to model simulations .",
    "these event weights account for the probability of a simulated neutrino to survive propagation through the earth and interact in or near the detector .",
    "preliminary testing of improved simulation for the 59-string detector configuration indicates that these inadequacies in the modeling of the detector were a major contributor to the shape disagreement between the 40-string simulation and data .",
