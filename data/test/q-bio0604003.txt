    "following the pioneering paper and proposal by englander , kallenbach , heeger , krumhansl and litwin @xcite , a number of authors considered simple idealized models for the roto / torsional dynamics of dna one , with the aim of describing nonlinear solitonic excitations which  according to the ideas of englander _ et al .",
    "_  would be related to the transcription bubble which travels along with rna - polymerase in the dna transcription process , and would thus play a functional role in this process .",
    "these models are based on modelling the dna molecule as a double chain of coupled pendulums ; the relevant nonlinear excitations would then be ( topological and dynamical ) solitons like those of the sine - gordon equation . for a review of the approaches in this direction ,",
    "see @xcite ; for general properties of dna and its functions , see e.g. @xcite .    it should be noted that in a related approach  but in a different direction ",
    "the stretching motions of the dna molecule ( related to dna denaturation ) have also been studied by nonlinear models , see in particular the peyrard - bishop model @xcite and extensions thereof @xcite . in this note",
    "we will focus on roto / torsional dynamics , and thus we will not deal with peyrard - bishop like models .    coming back to rotational dynamics , a very interesting and quite successful model ( also called y - model )",
    "was put forward by prof .",
    "yakushevich @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for further results and extensions .    in the model ,",
    "the dna molecule is considered homogeneous ( i.e. all nucleotides are considered as identical ) , and the state of each nucleotide is described by a single degree of freedom ; in fact , a rotation angle of the base belonging to the nucleotide around the @xmath4 atom in the sugar - phosphate backbone .",
    "each nucleotide ( or base ) is represented as a disk .",
    "interaction between successive nucleotides on each dna helix is via a harmonic potential , while the intrapair interaction ( i.e. interaction between bases in a watson - crick pair , and through these between the corresponding nucleotides ) is modelled by a potential which albeit harmonic in the distance , becomes anharmonic when described in terms of the relevant degrees of freedom , i.e. rotation angles .",
    "more precisely , with @xmath5 the distance between relevant points @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( see fig.2 ) of the disks representing nucleotides in the model , and @xmath1 the distance between the points @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the equilibrium ( i.e. the b - dna ) configuration , the intrapair potential is @xmath8 , with @xmath9 a dimensional constant .    in the standard model ,",
    "one considers the approximation @xmath10 , which leads to a number of computational simplification ; we call this the _ contact approximation _ , as it corresponds to having contact between the disks representing nucleotides at same site on the two chains . however , as pointed out by gonzalez and martin - landrove @xcite , @xmath11 is a singular case in that the description one thus obtains is not structurally stable : as soon as we consider @xmath12 , certain qualitative features of the model dynamics are changed .    in this note",
    "we will analyze the model beyond the contact approximation , i.e. with a nonzero value for the parameter @xmath1 ; we focus in particular on travelling wave solutions and soliton - like excitations , as they are the most important objects in the approach of englander _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in this case soliton solutions are still present , albeit the simple form obtained with the contact approximation is replaced by an expression involving elliptic integrals .",
    "the qualitative form of soliton solutions is little changed with respect to the standard y - model ; as for their width , it is very moderately increased ( see fig.5 ) , still remaining in the same order of magnitude .",

    "in the model the dna double chain is considered to be infinite , and all bases are considered as having the same physical characteristics ; it is thus an `` ideal '' dna model according to yakushevich s classification @xcite .",
    "moreover , each nucleotide is considered as a single unit and its state described in terms of an angular variable .",

    "the study of small amplitude excitations has some interest , both _ per se _ and in order to emphasize how crucial the contact approximation is in this regime .",
    "small amplitude dynamics around the equilibrium position @xmath237 is described by the linearization of ( 1.10 ) at @xmath146 .",

    "the dispersion relations are now completely degenerated , and the intrapair term has no role in them .",
