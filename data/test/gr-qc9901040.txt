    "a laser interferometer to detect gravitational waves , such as the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory(ligo ) , virgo , geo600 , or tama300 , will be in operation within several years@xcite .",
    "it is one of the most urgent subjects for theoretical relativists to make a set of templates of gravitational waves .",
    "the direct detection of gravitational waves is very important not only as a new  eye \" observing the universe ( gravitational wave astronomy ) but also as a new probe for fundamental physics .",
    "for example , we know that a neutron star , which is observed as a pulsar , has a mass @xmath1 and a radius @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "although we can guess its central region with some theoretical ansatz , we have no direct information from the inside of a neutron star because neither radiation nor a neutrino is transparent in the central region .",
    "the direct detection of gravitational waves may provide some information about the inside of a neutron star when it is formed , resulting in new observational facts or constraints about the equation of state for high density matter .",
    "one of the most promising astronomical sources for these ground - based detectors is a coalesced compact binary such as a neutron star binary . to complete a set of templates from such a source",
    ", many studies about the emitted gravitational waves have been done using various techniques .",
    "a numerical simulation without approximations ( numerical relativity ) is probably one of the best ways to calculate gravitational waves emitted from the compact binary system @xcite .",
    "although steady progress in numerical relativity has been achieved , there are still some difficulties which prevent us from finding the final results .    instead , there are some powerful approximation methods to mimic the coalescence of a compact binary system .",
    "one such approximation is the perturbative approach .",
    "regge and wheeler @xcite and zerilli @xcite first formulated a method for metric perturbations in a schwarzschild black hole spacetime .",
    "then there are many works using such a black hole perturbation method in which we describe gravitational waves by metric perturbations in a black hole background spacetime and treat a companion of the binary as a test particle@xcite .",
    "this approximation for gravitational waves in a head - on collision of two black holes gives a good agreement with the results obtained by numerical simulation@xcite .",
    "thus , such a perturbative approach may provide a good approximation for gravitational waves from a compact binary as well .    however , there are so far few works for neutron star perturbations",
    ". one may think that if we have two @xmath4 neutron stars , it will be a black hole after coalescence , when the ringing tail of the gravitational waves can be described by quasinormal modes of the black hole .",
    "the quasinormal modes of a neutron star may have nothing to do with the final stage of the coalescence .",
    "however , before black hole formation , we have to analyze the orbital evolution of the neutron star binary .",
    "therefore , we believe that a perturbation analysis for a neutron star is also important .    for a nonradial pulsation of a spherically symmetric relativistic star , perturbation equations both for axial and polar modes were first derived by thorne and campolattaro @xcite .",
    "similar to the black hole perturbation , the axial mode for a spherical star is described by a second order differential equation .",
    "on the other hand , the polar mode was first described by a fifth order differential equation@xcite . however , because of the dynamical degrees of freedom of polar modes , i.e. , sound waves and gravitational waves , the basic equation can be reduced to a fourth order differential equation as shown by lindblom and detweiler @xcite .",
    "lindblom , mendell , and ipser @xcite also derived a couple of second order differential equations , which could be interpreted as those for sound waves and gravitational waves , respectively .",
    "as in the case of black hole perturbations , quasinormal modes , if they exist , will be important in the analysis of gravitational waves from a compact binary . for the polar mode",
    ", there are two types of quasinormal modes of a neutron star ; one is a fluid oscillation mode similar to the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 modes of a newtonian star ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) ; the other is a wave mode ( @xmath8 mode ) , which exists only in general relativity @xcite . even for the axial mode ,",
    "chandrasekhar and ferrari@xcite illustrated that quasinormal modes exist if the effective potential has a minimal as that in an ultracompact star .",
    "kokkotas @xcite numerically calculated such axial quasinormal modes for various ultracompact stars .",
    "kojima @xcite extended it to a slowly rotating star , setting regge - wheeler gauge conditions .",
    "as for emitted gravitational waves from a binary system , kojima @xcite studied them for the case that a test particle is moving in a circular orbit around a polytropic star . for a circular orbit ,",
    "the axial mode cancels from the orbital symmetry so that the polar mode was only taken into account .",
    "he showed that the resonance mode appears in the energy flux when the orbit reaches the radius where the orbital frequency coincides with that of the quasinormal mode .",
    "for the axial mode , recently , borrelli @xcite calculated energy spectra of gravitational waves emitted by a test particle spiraling into an ultracompact star . in his result ,",
    "its energy spectrum shows many peaks , which correspond to axial quasinormal modes of the star .",
    "although it is important , since we are interested in a compact binary , a direct collision might show some different features from the binary case .",
    "we also do not know what will happen when a test particle reaches the surface of the star .",
    "to avoid such an unknown factor and to analyze the case of a compact binary , we first study gravitational waves emitted when a test particle is scattered by a neutron star in this paper .    for a schwarzschild black hole , oohara and",
    "nakamura @xcite analyzed it and showed that the energy spectrum has no peak except for one which corresponds to the orbital frequency .",
    "here we consider a spherical star instead of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we study only the axial mode which does not exist in newton gravity . to discuss the dependence of the equations of state , we analyze two models : a uniform density star as in @xcite and a polytropic star .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in secs .",
    "[ sec : linear]a and [ sec : linear]b , we briefly review the perturbation theory for a spherically symmetric relativistic star .",

    "some numerical techniques for calculating gravitational waves are summarized in the appendix . throughout this paper",
    ", we use units of @xmath9 and a metric signature of @xmath10 .",
    "we start with summarizing briefly the metric perturbation of a spherically symmetric relativistic star . a spherically symmetric background metric @xmath11 is described as @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a mass function inside a radius @xmath15 .",
    "we assume a perfect fluid as the stellar matter , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the total energy density and the pressure , respectively , which satisfy a barotropic equation of state , @xmath19 .",
    "using tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations , we construct a stellar model and its spacetime metric numerically except for the constant density star case .",
    "the radius @xmath20 of a star is defined by a surface where the pressure vanishes , and the mass of the star @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 .    for linearized einstein equations",
    ", we can decompose the perturbed metric into an axial mode @xmath23 and a polar mode @xmath24 : @xmath25    using regge - wheeler gauge conditions , we will integrate the interior and exterior regions of the linearized einstein equations , separately , and impose appropriate junction conditions at the surface @xmath20 to find the solution . in this paper",
    ", we only deal with axial mode perturbation .",
    "then , we write down the linearized einstein equation only for axial modes in the following subsections .      in order to find the linearized einstein equations for axial modes , we expand the perturbed metric by tensor harmonics for polar angle @xmath26 and azimuthal angle @xmath27 @xcite , and proceed to a fourier transformation for the time coordinate @xmath28 .",
    "although there are ten independent components for the linearized metric , four of them are gauge freedoms of coordinate transformations , which are fixed by a choice of regge - wheeler gauge @xcite , resulting in two components belonging to axial modes , while the rest of the four correspond to polar modes . for axial mode perturbations , we can set @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath15 defined below , and @xmath32 is a spherical harmonics .",
    "the axial mode in the interior region of a star is described by a single wave equation for gravitational waves , because a rotation does not exist in a spherically symmetric background spacetime .",

    "we find the energy spectrum @xmath88 of gravitational waves at infinity for the axial mode as @xmath89",
    "in this subsection , we consider a uniform density star . we restrict our analysis only to the case of the @xmath90 mode , just for simplicity .",
    "we find that features of the energy spectrum of emitted gravitational waves can be classified into two cases , which mainly depend on the shape of the effective potential .",

    "first , the regge - wheeler potential [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : outside_perturbation_equation_potential ] ) ] has a maximum point near @xmath92 ( accurately at @xmath93 for @xmath94 ) .",
    "second , the potential is discontinuous at the surface because of a discontinuity of the energy density of the star at the surface .",
    "finally , a potential minimum appears inside the star , if the star is ultracompact ( for the case of @xmath0 ) .    according to the last feature",
    ", we study two cases separately .",
    "the first stellar type is the case that the surface is outside the potential barrier ( @xmath95 ) . for a usual neutron star , @xmath96 , and",
    "then the first type is most likely a realistic astronomical object .",
    "the second stellar type is the case that the surface is inside the potential barrier ( @xmath97 ) , which may be an exotic star , if it exists .",
    "first we show our result for the first type . for the case of @xmath98",
    ", we show the energy spectra of emitted gravitational waves in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm5 ] . in this figure",
    ", there exists only a single peak in each spectrum .",
    "this peak corresponds to the orbital frequency of a test particle at the turning point , i.e. , periastron .",
    "this means that most gravitational waves are emitted around the turning point , where the effect of the gravitational field is the strongest .",
    "no other feature is found in this spectrum .",
    "in fact , fixing the energy @xmath99 and orbital angular momentum @xmath100 , the spectrum depends less on the compactness parameter @xmath91 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : rm5bh ] ) . for a black hole background",
    ", we find quite similar behaviors in the energy spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rm5bh ] ) , except for the high frequency region , where the difference of the boundary conditions is crucial .",
    "we also find that the spectrum approaches closer to that of a black hole as the star gets smaller .",
    "we also calculate the waveform for the case of @xmath101 and black holes , respectively .",
    "we see that a burst wave due to the encounter of a test particle emerges for each case . as the same as the energy spectrum , the difference between these waveform is very little ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wf5 ] )    therefore , for the first stellar type of @xmath102 , the energy spectrum largely depends on the trajectory , but not on the background object .",
    "next we discuss an ultracompact star , which shows much more various structure in the spectrum . in this case",
    ", a minimum point of the effective potential appears inside the star . as for the trajectory of a test particle , we have two possibilities : one is that the particle gets into the inside region beyond the potential barrier and the other is that one passes through outside the barrier . since the particle approaches closer to the star , it feels a stronger gravitational field . as a result ,",
    "the excitation by the particle is more efficient and the emitted gravitational waves are enhanced . as a numerical example , we show those energy spectra for the model with radius @xmath103 with the turning points @xmath104 and @xmath105 in fig . [",
    "fig : rm2.26 ] .    apart from a global maximum , which appears in the first type model as well and corresponds to the orbital frequency of a test particle at the turning point",
    ", we also find many small periodic peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm2.26 ] .",
    "this microscopic peak structure is classified into two types , which are divided at the frequency of the maximum @xmath106 ( @xmath107 for @xmath94 ) of the effective potential . in the lower frequency region ( @xmath108 )",
    ", small and sharp peaks correspond to the quasinormal modes , as we will show it next . for the higher frequency region ( @xmath109 ) , we find small periodic peaks , which may appear because of a resonance between two potential barriers .",
    "we will also discuss this later .    in order to analyze our numerical results",
    ", we first have to know the axial quasinormal modes . our method to calculate a quasinormal mode",
    "is based on the continued fraction expansion method which was originally used for black holes by leaver @xcite , and adopted for the polar mode of a spherical star by leins , nollert , and soffel @xcite .",
    "we apply this method to axial modes as well .",
    "we show our results in table [ tab : qnm_urm2.26 ] with those of kokkotas@xcite whose method is different from ours .",
    "the table shows that both results agree quite well .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm2.26qnm ] , we present both the quasinormal mode and energy spectrum . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : rm2.26qnm ] , axial ",
    "quasinormal \" modes are classified into two : the lower frequency mode ( @xmath110 ) , which imaginary part is very small @xmath111 , and the higher frequency mode ( @xmath112 ) , which imaginary part is rather large @xmath113 .",
    "the reason is very simple . for a frequency lower than @xmath114",
    ", we can have a quasibound state .",
    "since trapped waves tunnel through the potential barrier , the energy will decrease .",
    "it is similar to the quasinormal mode of a black hole .",
    "then , we may call it the axial quasinormal mode as well . however , if the frequency is higher than @xmath114 , we have no bound state .",
    "nevertheless , we can find the ",
    "quasinormal \" mode , by which we mean a wave solution with the same boundary condition as that of the conventional quasinormal mode , which is the outgoing wave condition . in the present case , although we find such wave solutions , those waves decay very quickly because the frequency is higher than the potential barrier .",
    "this is the reason why we find a large imaginary part of the mode frequency .",
    "the solutions which satisfy the boundary condition appear periodically as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : rm2.26qnm ] .",
    "we find that the frequencies of these quasinormal modes coincide with those of spectrum peaks in the frequency region lower than @xmath114 .",
    "this is because a test particle excites those quasinormal modes .",
    "in fact , when we see the waveform ( fig . [",
    "fig : wf2.26 ] ) , the wave consists of two parts : large one , which corresponds to the burst wave by the encounter by a test particle , and the other part with several oscillations , which comes from exited quasinormal modes in the spectrum .",
    "actually the waveform in the region after @xmath115 in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf2.26 ] is similar to kokkotas s result for a gaussian pulse wave @xcite .    on the other hand , in a frequency region",
    "higher than @xmath114 , although many periodic peaks appear , those positions are not exactly the same as the frequencies of  quasinormal \" modes .",
    "we may understand this fact as follows .",
    "even if the wave frequency @xmath116 is higher than the potential barrier , the reflection coefficient does not vanish and oscillates with respect to @xmath116 , which period is determined by the potential form . in the present case , we have also an infinite wall near the center of a star .",
    "we then expect that small periodic peaks appearing in the spectrum are due to an interference between the incoming and outgoing waves reflected by two potential barriers .",
    "since these waves decay very quickly as mentioned above , the process is quite dynamical , and then the peaks in the spectrum do not coincide with the frequencies of  quasinormal \" modes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm2.26 - 2.3 ] , we show the energy spectra for two stellar models with @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , which correspond to the cases that the turning point is inside and outside the barrier , respectively . for fixed energy @xmath119 and angular momentum @xmath100",
    ", the global peaks corresponding to the orbital frequency at the turning point agree with each other . on the other hand , the other small periodic peaks from the excited quasinormal modes do not agree with and rather depend on the compactness parameter @xmath91 . consequently , from the analysis of the energy spectrum of axial modes , we may determine the compactness parameter @xmath91 of an ultracompact star .",
    "we can also compare a black hole and an ultracompact star . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm2.26bh ] , we show the energy spectra both for a black hole @xcite and an ultracompact star with @xmath120 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : rm2.26bh ] , we see that even for the case of a schwarzschild black hole , the global peak due to the orbital motion of the particle coincides with that for the star . however , unlike the stellar model ,",
    "no small periodic peaks appear in the case of a black hole .",
    "in fact for a black hole , there is no peak after @xmath115 ( see fig .",
    "this is because the effective potential of the star has an infinite potential wall near the center , which guarantees the existence of quasinormal modes , while that of a schwarzschild black hole has no such wall , and incoming waves fall entirely into the event horizon @xmath121 .",
    "hence , we can also distinguish a background object , i.e. , whether it is an ultracompact star or a black hole , analyzing only axial modes .",
    "as for the total energy of emitted gravitational waves @xmath122 , we find @xmath123 with @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively , and for @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",

    "little depends on @xmath135 up to the case of a black hole .      from the analysis of the energy spectrum for a uniform density star , we find that the spectrum strongly depends on the shape of effective potential . therefore ,",

    "the difference is found in the frequencies of quasinormal modes because of the different shapes of the potential .",
    "then , we find many small and sharp peaks in the spectrum at the positions different from those for a uniform density star .",
    "consequently , we may be able to distinguish the inside structure of an ultracompact star by observing the energy spectrum of emitted gravitational waves .",
    "we have studied the axial modes of gravitational waves from a test particle scattered by a spherically symmetric relativistic star .",
    "we have considered both a uniform density star and a polytropic star .",
    "we find that the energy spectrum depends mainly on the shape of the effective potential for gravitational waves , i.e. , whether its minimum exists or not .",

    "gravitational waves are mostly emitted around the turning point , where the effect of the gravitational field is strongest .    while if a minimum of the effective potential exists ( i.e. , some exotic relativistic star with small compactness parameter @xmath155 ) , the energy spectrum shows a variety in its structure in addition to the global peak as the same as that found in the previous case .",
    "we find small and sharp periodic peaks in the region lower than @xmath114 ( the maximum value of the effective potential ) , which correspond to an excitation of the axial quasinormal modes .",
    "the existence of the potential minimum allows the existence of a quasibound state of gravitational waves , i.e. , quasinormal modes .",
    "then those modes are excited by a scattered particle .",
    "this becomes more conspicuous when the particle gets into the inside region beyond the potential barrier .",
    "we also find small periodic peaks in the frequency region beyond @xmath114 , which may come from an interference between two waves reflected by the potential barrier and the infinite wall near the center of the star .    from the observation of the energy spectrum of the axial mode ,",
    "what we can determine ? naively speaking , we may not find any information about the constituent of the star , because the axial mode does not couple to matter fluid .",
