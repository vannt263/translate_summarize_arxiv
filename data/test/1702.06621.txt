    "in june 2015 , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has resumed its physics program with proton - proton ( pp ) collisions at @xmath4 = 13 tev .",
    "currently , this is the highest centre - of - mass energy reached in the laboratory .",
    "a full description of particle production in pp collisions can not be obtained from perturbative quantum chromodynamics and hence modelling efforts typically employ various empirical components that have to be adjusted based on experimental data .",
    "the measurement of light flavour particles production in pp collisions provides important input for event generators to model the soft parton interactions and the hadronization processes .",
    "furthermore , pp collisions are used as reference to isolate medium effects present in larger colliding systems .",
    "previous alice measurements @xcite , @xcite , @xcite on identified particles in pp collisions at lower energies show that the models usually give a fair description of the shapes of the @xmath1 spectra but fail on the description of the pion , kaon and proton yields .",
    "@xmath5 , k@xmath6 , p and @xmath7 are identified in the rapidity window @xmath8 0.5 using several particle identification ( pid ) techniques in the different alice sub - detectors : the inner tracking system ( its ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , the time of flight detector ( tof ) and high momentum particle identification detector ( hmpid ) .",
    "the combined information of these detectors in different @xmath1 regions allows us to measure the particle production in the region starting from 150 mev/_c _ up to 20 gev/_c_.    the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons are measured with invariant - mass analyses via the reconstruction of their hadronic decays .",
    "the combinatorial background is subtracted using either a like - sign or event mixing technique .",
    "the resulting invariant - mass distributions are then fitted .",
    "previous measurements by alice and details on the analysis procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "the multi - strange @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 baryons are reconstructed via their weak hadronic decay products .",
    "candidates are selected with restrictions on the topology of the decay and the signal is extracted from the resulting invariant mass distributions .",
    "the full analysis procedure is described in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-dependent @xmath15 and @xmath16 ratios measured in central rapidity ( @xmath17 0.5 ) at @xmath4 = 2.76 , 7.0 and 13 tev are shown in fig .",
    "[ ratios ] . the comparison to pythia 8 @xcite ( monash-2013 @xcite ) for the different energies",
    "is also shown .    within the systematic uncertainties",
    "the @xmath16 ratio is consistent for the three different energies .",
    "the @xmath15 ratio for the low - intermediate @xmath1 region shows a slight shift towards higher @xmath1 when increasing @xmath4 . within our systematic uncertainties",
    "the ratio is compatible for the three different energies in the @xmath1 region above 10 gev/_c_. this shift is also observed on the monte carlo predictions from the pythia 8 model . the origin of the peak in pythia 8 is attributed to the colour reconnection mechanism @xcite , and is expected to become more important at higher centre - of - mass energy .    the @xmath1-integrated @xmath16 and @xmath15 ratios in pp collisions as a function of @xmath4 are shown in fig.[ratios_energies ] .",
    "results at different energies for different experiments are also shown .",
    "results from e735 at @xmath4 = 0.3 , 0.54 , 1.0 and 1.8 tev @xcite , @xcite , from phenix at @xmath4 = 62.4 and 200 gev @xcite and cms at @xmath4 = 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev @xcite are compared for both particle ratios .",
    "the last added point at 13 tev confirms the similar trend and saturation for @xmath18 900 gev observed in alice previous measurements .",
    "the hyperon - to - pion ratio as a function of @xmath4 measured in alice is shown in fig .",
    "[ hyperon_ratio ] . in comparison with the kaon- and proton - to - pion ratio",
    "the strange- and multi - strange - to - pion ratios show a hint of increase at 13 tev with respect to the lower collision energies .",
    "this enhanced production may be related to the enhancement observed as a function of multiplicity in pp collisions at @xmath4 = 7 tev @xcite , as the charged particle multiplicity density increases with the collision energy .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 meson production has been also measured in pp collisions at @xmath4 = 13 tev .",
    "the @xmath1-integrated @xmath19 and @xmath20 ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ ratios_resonances ] .",
    "however , no energy evolution is observed in the range from rhic to the highest lhc energy .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath21 and @xmath16 is the same at lhc energies within our systematic errors .",
    "pythia 8 describes the shape but exhibits large deviations from the data for transverse momenta larger than 2 gev/_c_. above @xmath22 900 gev the @xmath21 and @xmath16 ratios are energy independent within systematic uncertainties . the relative production of strange resonances ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) remains constant within a wide range of centre of mass energy .",
    "multiplicity dependent studies in pp collisions at 13 tev will help disentangle the role of collision energy and event multiplicity in the identified particle production of pp collisions .",
