    "double bars  systems where a small , faster - rotating `` inner '' bar forms concentrically within a large , `` outer '' bar  were proposed by shlosman , frank , & begelman ( 1989 ) as a mechanism for efficiently feeding gas into the centers of galaxies and fuelling activity there . though isolated examples of real double - barred galaxies were known earlier ( e.g. , de vaucouleurs 1974 ) , high - resolution imaging has revealed numerous examples in the last decade ; see friedli ( 1996 ) for a review .",
    "one observational signature is the twisting of isophotes within a large bar ; elmegreen et al .  ( 1996a ) argued that such twists were rather common in early - type barred galaxies .",
    "not all such isophote twists are due to inner bars , however : erwin & & sparke ( 1999 ) showed that twists , and peaks in the ellipticity profiles of isophotes , could also be caused by luminous , stellar nuclear rings or by kiloparsec - scale _ disks _ embedded within bars . here , we discuss some results from a survey designed to find out just how common inner bars  and other structures inside bars  might be , and learn something of their characteristics .",
    "a more complete description and analysis will appear in erwin & sparke ( 2001a , b ) .",
    "to minimize confusion due to dust , we concentrated on early type ( s0 and sa ) galaxies .",
    "we chose all barred ( sb or sab ) s0 and sa galaxies in the ugc , north of @xmath0 , which met the following criteria : nearby ( @xmath1 km / s ) , large and easily resolved ( major axis @xmath2 ) , and low to moderate inclination ( major : minor axis ratio @xmath3 ) . the virgo cluster was excluded , in order to concentrate on field galaxies .",
    "this resulted in a total of 38 galaxies ( the `` wiyn sample '' ) ; twenty of these are s0 , with ten s0/a and eight sa galaxies .",
    "the diameter limit excludes some low - surface - brightness galaxies , but this is probably the only significant bias .",
    "we observed all but two of the galaxies in @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the 3.5 m wiyn telescope in tucson , arizona , between december , 1995 , and march , 1998 .",
    "seeing ranged from 0.613 , with a median of 08 .",
    "we obtained archival hst images , both wfpc2 and nicmos , for over half the galaxies .",
    "for ngc 936 , we obtained @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 images ( 07 ) with the 4.2 m william herschel telescope in december , 2000 .",
    "we have also begun compiling a catalog of known double - bar and inner - disk systems , combining galaxies from our survey with other wiyn observations and with galaxies drawn from the literature . restricting ourselves to strong , unambiguous detections , we have taken information from a number of studies , including shaw et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ; wozniak et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and friedli et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; mulchaey , regan , & kundu ( 1997 ) ; jungwiert , combes , & axon ( 1997 ) , mrquez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; and greusard et al .",
    "we use the published images and ellipse fits  as well as archival hst images wherever available  to remeasure bar position angles and sizes in a consistent manner , and to eliminate mistaken inner bar / disk identifications due to nuclear rings , strong dust lanes , etc .",
    "we re - classify some galaxies as inner - disk rather than double - bar , using criteria explained below . to date",
    ", we have measurements for a total of 23 double - bar and 17 inner - disk galaxies ; this set is the `` expanded '' sample .",
    "to analyze the wiyn sample , we used a combination of ellipse fits to isophotes , unsharp masking , and color maps to identify and measure a variety of central structures in these barred galaxies : inner bars , inner disks , nuclear rings , nuclear spirals , and near - nuclear off - plane dust .",
    "we were particularly careful to discriminate between structures which can produce similar distortions in isophotes and ellipse fits ( figure  1 ) .",
    "inner bars are surprisingly common : they occur in at least one - quarter ( possibly as many as 40% ) of the barred s0sa galaxies in the wiyn sample , with no discernible dependence on hubble type or outer - bar strength .",
    "one galaxy is actually _",
    "triple_-barred ( ngc  2681 ; see erwin & sparke 1999 ) .",
    "a typical inner bar in the wiyn sample is 240750 pc in radius ( median = 400 pc ) , 614% the size of its `` parent '' outer bar ( median = 12% ) , and 38% of its galaxy s @xmath7 ( median = 5% ) . in the expanded sample ,",
    "we find a wider range in relative and absolute sizes ( 2401360 pc , 623% of outer - bar length , 313% of @xmath7 ) , but largely unchanged median values ( 740 pc , 13% , and 6% , respectively ) .",
    "we see no preferred angle between inner and outer bars , in either the wiyn or expanded samples .",
    "this agrees with previous results ( buta & crocker 1993 ; wozniak et al .",
    "1995 ) and supports models where inner bars rotate at different speeds than outer bars ( maciejewski & sparke 2000 ) .",
    "about half of the inner bars in the wiyn sample are surrounded by nuclear rings  dusty , star - forming , or purely stellar .",
    "about one - third of the wiyn sample inner bars are devoid of strong dust lanes , while two are found in the midst of substantial _ off - plane _ gas .",
    "structurally , inner bars appear similar to the outer bars ( see figure  2 ) , with the `` flat '' luminosity profiles seen in large bars in early - type galaxies ( elmegreen et al .",
    "1996b ) .",
    "finally , the presence or absence of inner bars has _ no _ statistically significant effect on nuclear activity in the wiyn sample : galaxies with only one bar are as likely to host agns as those with two .      here ,",
    "our classification is based purely on orientation : an elliptical structure ( within a large bar ) which is aligned to within 10 of the galaxy s outer disk is called an inner disk , as long as unsharp masking does not show it to be , e.g. , a nuclear ring instead .",
    "clearly , this class will include at least some inner bars with chance alignments , along with unresolved nuclear rings and possibly flattened inner bulges .",
    "however , there are several pieces of evidence indicating that our inner disks form a physically distinct class .    in the wiyn sample ,",
    "inner disks are as common as inner bars in s0 galaxies , but practically absent in later hubble types : 35% of the s0 galaxies had an inner disk , while we found one inner disk in an s0/a galaxy and none in sa galaxies .",
    "this contrasts strongly with inner bars , which are equally common for s0 , s0/a , and sa galaxies .",
    "inner disks are also too common for them _ all _ to be chance alignments of randomly oriented inner bars .",
    "finally , inner disks are systematically larger with respect to their parent bars ( median size = 19% for wiyn sample , 20% for expanded sample ) ; k - s tests indicate that inner bars and disks come from different parent populations at a 99.8% confidence level ( 96% for the wiyn sample ) .",
    "curiously , inner disks are not significantly larger than inner bars in absolute size , or as a fraction of @xmath7 ; the difference is due mostly to the bars of inner - disk galaxies being systematically smaller ( median radius = 3.9 kpc or 0.39 @xmath7 ) than the ( outer ) bars of double - barred galaxies ( 5.7 kpc or 0.52 @xmath7 ) .",
    "at least some of the structures we label inner disks have radial profiles similar to larger - scale galactic disks , and different from bars .",
    "figure  2 shows that the inner disk of ngc 3945 ( the largest and brightest in our sample ) differs dramatically in its luminosity profile from a typical inner bar ; it has an exponential profile with a scale length @xmath8 pc , and is distinct from the inner bulge profile .",
    "radial luminosity profiles may be a useful tool for determining the true identity of inner disks .",
    "kinematic data will be needed to determine if these inner disks are dynamically cool ; this would also distinguish them from oblate exponential bulges .",
    "we find nuclear rings in a quarter of the wiyn sample galaxies .",
    "most of these rings are dusty and/or star - forming ; such rings are preferentially found in sa galaxies .",
    "two of the s0 galaxies have purely stellar nuclear rings , which may be the remnants of past circumnuclear starburst episodes ( see erwin , vega , & beckman , this volume , for more details ) .",
    "we find nuclear spirals in @xmath9% of the galaxies ; two of these have blue , luminous stellar arms , indicating recent star formation , but the other six are seen only in dust absorption .",
    "finally , 30% of the s0 galaxies have evidence for off - plane gas in the central kiloparsec , in addition to misaligned h i gas at much larger radii .",
