    "the case for supermassive black holes ( bhs ) in galactic nuclei is now very strong , and in a few galaxies almost irrefutable .",
    "the evidence is most compelling in galaxies where the kinematics of stars or gas can be traced into sub - parsec scales ; examples are the milky way ( genzel et al .",
    "1997 ; ghez et al .",
    "1998 ) , where stellar proper motions can be measured at distances of @xmath1 pc , and ngc 4258 ( miyoshi et al . 1995 ) , where the rotation curve of h@xmath2o maser sources obeys kepler s law into @xmath3 pc . for a larger sample of galaxies , kinematical data extending into @xmath4 or @xmath5 pc provide suggestive though not yet irrefutable evidence of supermassive compact objects ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "although the masses of the detected bhs comprise on average only @xmath6 of the mass of their host spheroids ( ho 1998 ) , there is a growing body of work suggesting that the dynamical influence of a supermassive bh can extend far beyond the nucleus .",
    "furthermore the formation and growth of bhs may be intimately connected with the evolution of galaxies on larger scales .",
    "for instance , mergers between galaxies containing nuclear bhs would produce supermassive bh binaries which would eventually coalesce via the emission of gravitational radiation ( begelman , blandford & rees 1980 )",
    ". the formation and decay of these binaries may be relevant to a wide range of phenomena , from the wiggling of radio jets ( kaastra & roos 1992 ) to the destruction of stellar density cusps ( ebisuzaki et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "this review discusses the time scale for coalescence of supermassive bh binaries (  2 ) and the dynamical effect of the bhs on stellar nuclei (  3 ) and the large - scale structure of galaxies (  4 ) .",
    "supermassive bhs appear to be ubiquitous components of galactic nuclei .",
    "since galaxies often merge , one would expect to form bh binaries at a rate that is roughly equal to the galaxy merger rate .",
    "the formation and coalescence of a bh binary is believed to take place via three , fairly distinct stages ( begelman , blandford & rees 1980 ) :    \\1 .",
    "two parent galaxies interact ; the bhs  surrounded by their dense star clusters  sink to the center of the common potential well via dynamical friction , forming a binary .",
    "the bh binary shrinks by ejecting stars from the nucleus via three - body interactions .",
    "when the binary separation has fallen to the value at which gravitational radiation becomes efficient , the bhs coalesce .    in the absence of gas ,",
    "the rates of the first two processes are in principle possible to calculate via @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "however the problem is a difficult one to simulate due to the wide range of length and time scales ; none of the published simulations have succeeded in following the decay to the point where gravitational radiation would become important . here",
    "we derive a simple analytical model for the decay of bh binaries which reproduces the results of the @xmath0-body simulations , then use it to estimate the coalescence time .",
    "consider a binary with total mass @xmath7 , @xmath8 and semimajor axis @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the background galaxy is initially a singular isothermal sphere , with density and mass profiles @xmath10 @xmath11 is the one - dimensional stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the binary becomes `` hard '' when @xmath12 falls below @xmath13 ( quinlan 1996 ) ; subsequent evolution is driven by the capture and ejection of stars that interact with the binary .",
    "the hardening rate @xmath14 depends only weakly on @xmath15 and on @xmath12 for @xmath16 ; in the limit @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( hills 1992 ; mikkola & valtonen 1992 ; quinlan 1996 ) .",
    "mass ejection occurs at a rate @xmath19 where @xmath20 is again nearly independent of ( @xmath15 , @xmath12 ) for @xmath17 ( quinlan 1996 ) .",
    "thus @xmath21",
    "if the binary remained fixed at the center of a spherical potential , it would quickly eject all stars on orbits with pericenters less than @xmath22 .",
    "the local density would fall to zero and the binary would cease to harden .",
    "we assume instead that mass removal produces a constant - density core of stars out to some radius @xmath23 , where @xmath24 in order to achieve this , the binary must interact with stars at radii @xmath25 .",
    "this may seem an optimistic assumption , but it turns out that something very similar happens in the @xmath0-body simulations , as discussed below .",
    "the binary separation rapidly falls below @xmath26 and subsequent evolution occurs against an evolving background density @xmath27 . combining equations ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 )",
    ", we find for the hardening rate @xmath28 the logarithm represents the decrease in the hardening rate due to the declining stellar density . integrating with respect to time , @xmath29\\ ] ] where @xmath30 .",
    "the functions @xmath31 and @xmath9 may be approximated as @xmath32}\\ ] ] for @xmath33 a few @xmath34 .",
    "we may compare the predictions of this simple model to the results of @xmath0-body simulations of bh binary decay .",
    "quinlan & hernquist ( 1997 ) ( qh ) followed the evolution of a bh binary in a galaxy with an initial @xmath35 density cusp . expressed in their units , the scaling parameters in eq .",
    "( 7 ) are @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "1 is a plot of eq .",
    "( 7 ) scaled to these units .",
    "the predicted time dependence @xmath9 is qualitatively very similar to that found by qh ( their fig .",
    "however , those authors found that the rate of binary decay depended systematically on the number @xmath0 of particles used to represent the galaxy : larger values for @xmath0 gave slower evolution . for @xmath39 , the smallest number considered by them , fig . 1 overestimates the evolution rate by a factor of only @xmath40 , remarkably close given the approximations made .",
    "for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the adjustment factors are @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "qh attributed the @xmath0-dependence of the hardening rate to wandering of the binary about the center of the galaxy potential . in a core of density @xmath45",
    ", an rms velocity @xmath46 of the binary s center of mass will produce a wandering with amplitude @xmath47 .",
    "if the source of the binary s motion were elastic encounters with stars of mass @xmath48 , equipartition arguments would give @xmath49 .",
    "however the binary converts some of its binding energy into bulk motion when it ejects stars , with momenta @xmath50 .",
    "this `` super - elastic scattering '' allows the binary to sample the stellar density over a much wider range of radii than if it remained stationary ; qh in fact verified that fixing the binary to the center of the potential caused the hardening to cease after the binary had ejected most of the stars within @xmath51 .",
    "if the background density within the wandering radius @xmath52 were to fall , the gravitational restoring force acting on the binary would also drop and the wandering amplitude would increase , roughly in proportion to @xmath53 .",
    "this feedback mechanism should tend to inhibit the formation of a central `` hole '' in the stellar density ( mikkola & valtonen 1992 ) .",
    "the crude model derived above mimics this process by forcing the background density to remain constant for @xmath54 ; the model could be improved by incorporating the wandering radius explicitly .    in the @xmath0-body simulations , the perturbations that the binary experiences from the `` stars '' become less noisy as @xmath0",
    "is increased , implying a reduced wandering radius and a lower hardening rate .",
    "makino ( 1997 ) found that the wandering amplitude varied roughly as @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "however qh found that the hardening rate did not change appreciably when @xmath0 was increased from @xmath42 to @xmath57 .",
    "they argued that @xmath52 might reach a limiting amplitude for large @xmath0 due to the feedback mechanism discussed above .",
    "this hypothesis is important to check ; however doing so will require simulations with very large particle numbers .",
    "the binary will rapidly coalesce when the time scale for emission of gravitational radiation @xmath58 ( peters 1964 , for a circular binary ) equals the hardening time @xmath59 . using eq .",
    "( 6 ) , this occurs when @xmath60 where @xmath61 or @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 i.e. the binary must shrink by a factor of @xmath66 beyond the hardening radius for coalescence to occur .",
    "the simulations of qh followed the decay only over a factor of @xmath67 beyond @xmath68 .",
    "we can use the analytic expressions derived here to extend the @xmath0-body simulations until a time corresponding to coalescence ; the correction factor of 5 mentioned above is applied to @xmath69 in order to reproduce the hardening rate observed in the largest-@xmath0 simulations .",
    "2a shows the time from formation of a hard binary until coalescence , @xmath70 , as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath71 for a binary with @xmath72 .",
    "an approximate expression is @xmath73 if we further approximate the logarithm as a constant , @xmath74 , then @xmath75 while eq .",
    "( 14 ) is an accurate extrapolation of the evolution seen in the @xmath0-body experiments , it should probably be interpreted as a lower limit to the coalescence time expected in a real spherical galaxy due to the likely overestimate of the wandering radius in the simulations .",
    "however the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath71 and @xmath11 is probably more robust . since for real galaxies @xmath76 and @xmath77 , eq . (",
    "14 ) predicts a coalescence time that is almost independent of @xmath11 and @xmath78 .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "2a is the `` faber - jackson law '' for bhs , @xmath79 this relation is consistent with three galaxies whose bh masses are well - determined : m84 ( bower et al . 1998 ) , m87 ( macchetto et al . 1997 ) and ngc 4258 ( miyoshi et al .",
    "2a suggests a typical coalescence time of several billion years .",
    "very low mass binaries would evolve more rapidly ( eq .",
    "14 ) , but another factor would delay their coalescence : the necessity of the two bhs finding their way to the potential center following a galaxy merger .",
    "governato et al .",
    "( 1994 ) carried out merger simulations of galaxies containing bhs ; they concluded that inspiral times could be very long if the infalling galaxy had a sufficiently low mean density to be tidally disrupted .",
    "a more likely scenario is that the infalling bh retains some of the mass of its host galaxy .",
    "we can estimate the inspiral time by assuming that the smaller galaxy is tidally limited by the larger galaxy as its orbit decays . following merritt ( 1984 ) ,",
    "the tidal radius is located at the point where the effective potential ( gravitational plus centrifugal ) has a saddle point . approximating both galaxies as singular isothermal spheres and assuming that the smaller galaxy ( of mass @xmath80 ) is on a circular orbit of radius @xmath81 , its tidal radius and mass become @xmath82 with @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath83 the velocity dispersions of the larger and smaller galaxies respectively .",
    "formula then gives for the orbital decay rate and infall time @xmath84 ( tremaine 1990 ) , where @xmath85 .",
    "taking @xmath86 ( valluri & merritt 1998 ) , the effective radius of the larger galaxy , the inspiral time becomes @xmath87 where eq .",
    "( 15 ) has been used to relate @xmath83 to @xmath71 .",
    "this relation is plotted in fig . 2b and the total time @xmath88 in fig . 2c .",
    "remarkably , fig .",
    "2c suggests that real bhs have roughly the mass that would be required to minimize their total coalescence time .",
    "nevertheless , this time appears to be very long .",
    "other mechanisms might accelerate the coalescence .",
    "if the potential of the stellar nucleus is non - axisymmetric , orbits will not conserve angular momentum and stars with a much wider range of energies may interact with the binary .",
    "however it is not clear whether self - consistent triaxiality can be maintained in a nucleus where the potential is dominated by a bh ( sridhar & touma 1999 ; merritt & valluri 1999 ) .",
    "gas if present would also exert a drag force on the binary .",
    "`` loss - cone refilling '' by two - body interactions between stars ( frank & rees 1976 ) is almost certainly unimportant due to the long relaxation times in nuclei ( valtonen 1996 ) .",
    "if coalescence times are comparable to the mean time between galaxy mergers , a third bh would often be introduced into a nucleus containing an uncoalesced pair .",
    "the most likely outcome is ejection of two bhs in opposite directions with the third remaining at the center ( valtonen 1996 ) .",
    "this process could substantially reduce the mean ratio of bh mass to galaxy mass over time .",
    "combining eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 12 ) , the total mass ejected by the bh binary between @xmath89 and @xmath90 is @xmath91 .",
    "the structure of the pre - existing nucleus should therefore be disturbed out to a radius where the enclosed stellar mass was a few times @xmath78 .",
    "a reasonable guess for the initial density profile is @xmath92 , as assumed in the model above ; adiabatic growth of a bh in a nucleus with a shallower profile generically leads to a power - law cusp with index near 2 ( quinlan et al .",
    "1995 ; merritt & quinlan 1998 ) , and this is also the slope observed in the faintest ellipticals ( kormendy et al .",
    "1995 ) which are the least likely to have experienced the sort of core disruption discussed above .    simply removing all of the stars with energies below some minimum",
    "@xmath93 produces a density profile near the bh of @xmath94}de \\approx   c\\times f(e_{min})\\sqrt{{gm_{12}\\over r } } \\propto r^{-1/2}\\ ] ] assuming an isotropic velocity distribution @xmath95 .",
    "nakano & makino ( 1999a , b ) found this to be a good description of what happens in @xmath0-body simulations of a single bh spiralling into a pre - existing core . in the case of a decaying bh binary , stars on eccentric orbits are most likely to interact with the binary and be removed , leaving behind a nucleus in which the stellar motions are strongly biased toward circular .",
    "the resulting density profile is difficult to calculate .",
    "the @xmath0-body simulations discussed above ( makino 1997 ; qh ) yield central profiles that are crudely describable as power laws , with indices @xmath96 ; however these results are probably dependent on the degree of bh wandering and hence on @xmath0 .    which galaxies in the current universe would be expected to contain these low - density cores ?",
    "kauffmann & haehnelt ( 1999 ) present a semi - analytic model for the formation of galaxies in a cold - dark - matter universe ; they assume that supermassive bhs form from gas that is driven into the centers of galaxies during mergers .",
    "the predicted ratio of gas mass to stellar mass during the last major merger is a steep function of galaxy luminosity in their model ; this ratio drops from @xmath43 for @xmath97 to @xmath98 for @xmath99 , albeit with considerable scatter ( their fig .",
    "gas - rich mergers would be expected to form dense nuclei while gas - free mergers should produce low - density cores after the bhs coalesce .",
    "figure 3 shows that the variation of @xmath100 with galaxy luminosity is roughly consistent with kauffmann & haehnelt s model .",
    "faint ellipticals , @xmath101 , have @xmath102 , while for brighter galaxies @xmath100 decreases with increasing luminosity .",
    "this trend is often described as a dichotomy although the data of fig .",
    "3 suggest a continuous distribution , as expected in a model like kauffmann & haehnelt s .",
    "the gravitational influence of a supermassive bh can extend far beyond the nucleus in a galaxy that is not axisymmetric ( gerhard & binney 1985 ) .",
    "the mechanism is dynamical chaos induced in the stellar orbits by close passages to the bh ( merritt & valluri 1996 ) .",
    "although relatively little @xmath0-body work has been done on this problem , one study ( merritt & quinlan 1998 ) found that nuclear point masses can cause initially triaxial galaxies to evolve to globally axisymmetric shapes in little more than a crossing time when the ratio of bh mass to galaxy mass exceeds @xmath103 . this mass ratio is consistent with the value that induces a transition to global stochasticity and rapid mixing in the phase space of box - like orbits ( valluri & merritt 1998 ) .",
    "mergers of stellar disks produce generically triaxial objects ( barnes 1996 ) ; adding a dissipative component to the simulations produces end states that are much more nearly axisymmetric ( barnes & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "the evolution in shape occurs rapidly once a few percent of the total mass has accumulated in the center ( barnes 1999 ) .",
    "the stars in these simulations respond to the `` gas '' only insofar as the latter affects the potential ; thus the change in shape is a purely stellar - dynamical phenomenon , and we would expect to see similar evolution even in gas - free mergers if the bhs are sufficiently massive",
    ".    the typical ratio of bh mass to galaxy mass is @xmath104 ( ho 1998 ) , somewhat less than the value required to induce a rapid transition to axisymmetry . for @xmath105 ,",
    "merritt & quinlan ( 1998 ) found a time scale of @xmath106 crossing times for the evolution to axisymmetry .",
    "this exceeds a hubble time for galaxies with luminosities above @xmath107 ( valluri & merritt 1998 ) ; hence we might expect bright ellipticals to often retain their merger - induced triaxial shapes .",
    "in fact there is evidence for a systematic change in the shape of ellipticals at about this magnitude ( tremblay & merritt 1996 ) ; bright ellipticals as a class show evidence for triaxiality , while the axis - ratio distribution of faint ellipticals is consistent with axisymmetry .    the same orbital evolution that destroys triaxiality also tends to produce a smoother phase - space density .",
    "one consequence is that `` boxiness '' in the isodensity contours ",
    "a natural consequence of a non - smooth phase space distribution ( binney & petrou 1985 )  should be destroyed along with triaxiality .",
    "this too has been observed in simulations of gaseous mergers ; the effect is sometimes attributed to `` dissipation '' ( e.g. bekki & shioya 1997 ) but it is again almost certainly a purely stellar dynamical effect .",
    "a prediction is that triaxiality should correlate with boxiness , since a central mass concentration or bh should tend to destroy both following a merger .",
    "evidence for such a correlation has been noted by kormendy & bender ( 1996 ) .",
