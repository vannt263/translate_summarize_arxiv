    "with the implementation of efficient ccd cameras at 4 m class - telescopes deep imaging in high galactic latitude fields has become a powerful tool to study galaxy evolution . since the pioneering work of tyson ( 1988 ) , deep ground -based observations",
    "have been extended to different color bands ( metcalfe et al . , 1995 ; smail et al .",
    "1995 , hogg et al .",
    "1997 ) with image quality of 1 arcsec fwhm or better .",
    "a new benchmark for deep survey work has been set by the hubble deep field observations ( williams et al . , 1996 ) . although the size of the hst primary mirror is 2.5 m only and the ccds in the wfpc2 instrument have relatively poor blue and uv sensitivities , the combination of very long integration time",
    ", low sky background and sub - arcsec angular size for most of the faint galaxies in the field , has led to limiting magnitudes which are more than a factor of ten fainter than the deepest ground - based surveys .",
    "+ the hst observations , beside their intrinsic scientific value , acted as a very efficient catalyst for complementary photometric work in other bands , notably the ir , and for spectroscopic observations of galaxies down to @xmath13=25 with the keck telescope .",
    "the project also demonstrated the scientific advantage of dedicating a sizable chunk of observing time to the deep exploration of a single , size - limited field .",
    "the other crucial development in this field has been the identification by the `` lyman break '' technique ( steidel and hamilton , 1993 ; steidel , pettini and hamilton , 1995 ) and subsequent spectroscopic follow - up of a large number ( a few hundreds known at the beginning of 1998 ) of @xmath14 galaxies with the keck telescope ( steidel et al .",

    "the lyman break technique is an example ( so far the one with the highest success rate ) of the photometric redshift techniques . since",
    "accurate photometry can be obtained for objects at least two magnitudes fainter than the spectroscopic limit , photometric redshifts , that is redshifts which are obtained by comparing broad band observations of galaxies with a library of observed templates or with stellar population synthesis models , are the only practicable way to extend the studies of the population of galaxies at high redshifts ( @xmath154 and beyond ) to luminosities below @xmath16 .",
    "photometric redshifts have been derived from ground - based observations to relatively bright magnitude limits and redshifts @xmath17 ( koo 1985 , connolly et al .",
    "the data set of the hdf , which goes much deeper , has revived the interest in this type of work with significant results ( sawicki et al 1997 , connolly et al .",

    "the scientific goals were the study of the photometric redshift distribution of the faint galaxies and of gravitational shearing in the field .",
    "the field of view of the susi ccd camera is comparable to the hdf , and the goal was to reach limiting magnitudes in the four bands which would enable photometric redshift estimates to @xmath20 or about 1.5 magnitude fainter than in the previous work by giallongo et al.(1998 ) .",
    "the final coadded calibrated frames have been made available since january 98 at the following address : + http://www.eso.org / research / sci - prog / ndf/.    the chosen field , hereafter referred to as ntt deep field or nttdf , is at 80 arcsec south of the @xmath0 qso br1202 - 072 ( mcmahon et al 1994 ) .",

    "a comparative study with a wfpc2-hst image of the same field allows us to estimate the image quality of the nttdf . despite the broadening of the stellar profiles due to the effect of the seeing , the comparison of the the star / galaxy classification of the nttdf objects and the one of the wfpc2 shows good agreement .",
    "reliable star / galaxy separation is obtained down to i@xmath5224 where the star contamination of the galaxy sample is @xmath521.5% .",
    "the comparison of the stellar content of the nttdf with the one of the hdf indicates that the star density in the nttdf is @xmath3 times higher , and of the 26 stars in the magnitude range @xmath53 , 6 are low mass stars or possible brown dwarfs with a notable object having ( v - i)@xmath54 .",
    "we have shown that the galaxy number counts at faint magnitudes ( @xmath55 ) converge to a slope @xmath56 in all bands .",
    "the flattening in the blue band removes the divergence in the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) and shows that the dominant galaxies of the ebl have b@xmath5725 ( madau 1997 ) . as shown by guhathakurta et al .",
    "( 1990 ) the contribution of high redshift galaxies ( @xmath58 ) is not more than 10% of the total number counts at @xmath5925 . in our sample",
    "the contribution to the number counts of star forming galaxies at @xmath604 is @xmath52 5 % for 24@xmath61 25 and @xmath52 3 % for 25@xmath6126 .",
    "if the flattening observed in b is due to the reddening ( combination igm @xmath62 lyman break ) of galaxies at z@xmath63 , it can not explain the similar flattening in the v band .",
    "thus , the high redshift star forming galaxies are not a dominant population to explain the excess of faint sources .",
    "+ at faint magnitudes , the number counts can be dominated by the faint - end luminosity function ( lf ) at increasing redshift ( with a decreasing contribution of the bright galaxies - @xmath64 - beyond z@xmath52 0.6 - 1 ) , thus the observed slope implies that the slope of the faint - end lf is as steep as @xmath65 ( by assuming a schechter function for the lf gives @xmath66 ) .",
    "such a steep slope is supported by hst observations ( driver et al . , 1995 ) where a similar value is obtained for the late - type galaxies which are the dominant population responsible for the number excess .",
    "this evidence is supported by the rapid evolution of the faint - end luminosity function for bluer samples observed in the deep spectroscopic surveys ( lilly et al.,1996 , ellis et al . , 1996 ) up to z@xmath67 .",
    "+ the median color evolution shows a rapidly blueing with increasing magnitude ( up to @xmath68 ) . from @xmath69 to @xmath7025.5 , our data suggest that the blueing trend is reduced , in agreement with smail et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and stops beyond @xmath71 . analyzing colors as a function of the i magnitude , a similar effect is observed beyond i@xmath52 25 .",
    "the stabilization of the blueing trends observed in the data is consistent with the convergence of the slope in the galaxy number - counts ( assuming that we observe the same population in different bands ) .",
    "+ using the approach described by giallongo et al . ( 1998 ) , we have selected a sample of high - z galaxies in the range @xmath72 .",
    "the derived surface density in our field is 0.8@xmath73 arcmin@xmath10 at @xmath43 and 2.0 @xmath740.6 arcmin@xmath10 at @xmath47 .",
    "this sample requires spectroscopic follow - up on 8-m class telescopes ( for example the vlt with the fors instrument ) .",
    "we have derived a lower limit for the star formation rate per unit comoving volume at @xmath75 for galaxies with @xmath47 of @xmath76 for @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "our estimation should be regarded as a lower limit due to the selection technique which is biased against lyman @xmath77 emission line galaxies ( hu et al .",
