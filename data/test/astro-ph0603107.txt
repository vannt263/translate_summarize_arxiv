    "the rapid time variabilities and the compactness problem ( see , e.g. , a review by piran @xcite ) suggest that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) should arise from internal shocks within relativistic flows . in the standard model , a strong magnetic field",
    "is generated , and electrons are fermi - accelerated in shocked regions . the physical conditions in the shocked region imply @xcite that protons may be also fermi - accelerated to energies @xmath0 ev .",
    "high - energy protons in the grb photon field can create high - energy neutrinos via photopion production @xcite .",
    "future observations of neutrinos will be important to prove the standard model of grbs and the particle acceleration theory .",
    "the highest energy of neutrinos brings us information on physical conditions of grbs .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that the kaon contribution becomes important for neutrino production from jets in supernovae .",
    "they considered mildly relativistic jets that are much more baryon - rich than a fireball of grbs where collisions among accelerated protons ( @xmath1 ) occur efficiently  @xcite , making pions and kaons that decay into neutrinos . since",
    "high - energy charged mesons will cool down before they decay into neutrinos , the highest energy of neutrinos is determined by the equilibrium of the cooling timescale and the decay timescale of mesons .",
    "considering synchrotron cooling , the highest energy of mesons that decay into neutrinos is proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the mass and the lifetime of mesons at rest , respectively .",
    "so , @xcite pointed out that the heavier mass of kaons than pions leads to dominance of neutrinos from kaon decay in the highest energy region .",
    "we note that the contribution of kaons for neutrino production may also be important even in internal shocks of grbs . in this study",
    ", we calculate the spectrum of neutrinos from grbs , taking account of decaying modes of charged kaons into neutrinos . also , we consider the contribution of long - lived neutral kaons , @xmath5 , for neutrino production , which was not taken into account in the previous work .",
    "it is noted that @xmath5 does not cool at all before decay into neutrinos and has some decaying modes into charged pions and neutrinos .",
    "so , it is expected that the highest energy of neutrinos comes from the decay of long - lived neutral kaons .    in this letter , using the monte carlo method , we show that the highest energy neutrinos mainly come from kaons even in internal shocks of grbs . in  2",
    ", we explain our model and method .",
    "the numerical results are in  3 .",
    " 4 is devoted to discussion .",
    "our method of simulation is essentially the same as in @xcite but quantitatively improved . in this study , we adopt experimental results for the cross sections of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 @xcite for @xmath10 gev , where @xmath11 is the photon energy in the proton rest frame .",
    "we neglect the reaction @xmath12 , because the cross section is too small and the neutrino production rate is independent of this reaction .",
    "since we do not have experimental data of multi - pion production for @xmath13 gev , we extrapolate the cross section by a constant value .",
    "however , our total photoabsorption cross section agrees well with the experimental value for @xmath14 gev @xcite . for the pion production by @xmath15",
    ", we adopt the same cross sections as @xmath16 .",
    "kaons are produced via @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , or @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "since there are no detailed and precise data of kaon production experiments , we adopt values theoretically obtained for the cross sections of kaon production from @xmath16 and @xmath15 @xcite . as shown in figure 1 , the contribution of kaon production seems negligible .",
    "however , the importance of kaon production will be shown later .",
    "of course , @xmath1 collisions may also create mesons .",
    "since the number of target photons is much larger than the proton number density in our case , we neglect the effects of @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the inelasticity is approximated by a conventional method as @xmath23/2 $ ] , where @xmath24 is the invariance of the square of the total four - momentum of the @xmath16 ( @xmath15 ) system , and @xmath25 is the proton mass .",
    "for the double - pion production , we approximate the inelasticity by replacing @xmath3 with @xmath26 .    our parameter set is similar to that in @xcite : the total photon energy in a burst @xmath27 , the number of light - curve pulses ( or spikes ) @xmath28 , the lorentz factor of the shells @xmath29 , and shell - collide distances from the central engine @xmath30 .",
    "the number @xmath28 corresponds to the number of shells that emit gamma rays .",
    "the photon energy deposited into each shell is therefore @xmath31 . in the standard model",
    ", shells can collide and emit gamma rays at distances @xmath30 larger than @xmath32 cm from the central sources , where @xmath33 is the time between shell ejection events . for simplification , @xmath30 and @xmath29 are common for all @xmath28 shells in this simulation .",
    "the photon number spectrum in the energy range @xmath34 in the shell rest frame is set at @xmath35 for 1 ev @xmath36 1 kev and @xmath37 for 1 kev @xmath38 mev .",
    "the break energy 1 kev corresponds to @xmath39 kev in the observer frame . for @xmath40",
    "ev , the synchrotron self - absorption may be crucial @xcite , while the pair absorption may be crucial for @xmath41 mev ( e.g. , see asano & takahara 2003 , peer & waxman 2004 ) .",
    "although the upper bound of the photon energy depends on the model parameter because of pair production , we fix the value as 10 mev ( @xmath42gev in the observer frame ) . since higher energy protons mainly interact with lower energy photons , the production rate of very high energy neutrinos is not sensitive to this upper bound .",
    "the shell width in the comoving frame is assumed to be @xmath43 , as conventionally assumed , although there is the possibility of thinner shells @xcite .",
    "we express the energy density of the magnetic field as @xmath44 times the photon energy density . in this letter",
    ", we adopt @xmath45 .",
    "we inject protons with a number spectrum proportional to @xmath46 above 10 gev in the shell rest frame .",
    "the maximum proton energy is determined by the condition that the larmor radius is smaller than both the size scale of the emitting region and the energy - loss length .",
    "we estimate the energy - loss length using synchrotron , inverse compton , and photomeson cooling processes .",
    "the total energy of the accelerated protons in a shell is assumed to be the same as @xmath47 .",
    "our method pursues energy loss processes of each baryon via synchrotron , inverse compton , and photomeson cooling processes during the dynamical timescale @xmath48 in the shell rest frame .",
    "we have simulated for a wide range of parameters as @xmath49-@xmath50 ergs , @xmath51-@xmath52 , @xmath53-@xmath52 , and @xmath54-@xmath55 cm .",
    "of course , larger @xmath27 and smaller @xmath30 are favorable for neutrino production , and as @xcite showed , very luminous bursts are required to detect neutrinos on the earth .",
    "therefore , we show only one representative example in this letter .",
    "the parameter values are @xmath56 ergs , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ergs ) , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 cm . the corresponding variability timescale @xmath59 ms , which is not so far from the typical observed timescale @xmath60 s.    since the allowed region of the grb parameters is wide , there may be both optically thin and thick sources to thomson scattering @xcite .",
    "our example would imply that @xmath30 is close to the photosphere . when it is assumed that the energy density of protons is the same as the photon energy density and the average proton energy is mildly relativistic ( @xmath61 ) , the proton number density in the comoving frame is obtained as @xmath62 .",
    "this means that the optical depth for the thomson scattering is @xmath42 for our parameter set .",
    "photon scatterings do not sufficiently affect the gamma - ray spectrum for this marginal optical depth . from our simulation , we obtain spectra of created mesons as is shown in figure 2 .",
    "one - half of neutral kaons are @xmath5 , while the rest are @xmath63 .",
    "since the cross sections of kaon production are smaller than those of pion production , the number of kaons is much less than pions .",
    "however , the highest energy charged mesons will cool down before they decay into neutrinos .",
    "our results for other parameter sets agree with the condition of ultra high energy cosmic - ray production obtained by @xcite : @xmath64 cm . in the case of figure 2 , also protons above @xmath55 ev cool down before they escape from the shell .",
    "we follow the behavior of pions and kaons until they decay into positrons ( electrons ) and neutrinos using the same method as in @xcite .",
    "synchrotron and inverse compton emissions are taken into account .",
    "charged kaons have six decay modes ; @xmath65 ( 63% ) , @xmath66 ( 21% ) , @xmath67 ( 6% ) , @xmath68 ( 5% ) , @xmath69 ( 3% ) , and @xmath70 ( 2% ) , while @xmath5 will decay into @xmath71 ( 39% ) , @xmath72 ( 27% ) , @xmath73 ( 21% ) , and @xmath74 ( 13% ) . in figure 3 ,",
    "total neutrino spectra emitted from this example are shown .",
    "although there are fewer kaons than pions , the highest energy neutrinos originate from kaons around @xmath75 ev .    since very high flux is required to detect neutrinos from grbs by a @xmath76 neutrino detector such as icecube @xcite , we consider an optimistic case : a grb occurs at 30 mpc , and the detection efficiency of upward - going neutrinos with energy @xmath77 is assumed to be @xmath78 for @xmath79",
    "ev , although it may be difficult to measure energies of neutrinos above @xmath80 ev by icecube .",
    "figure 4 shows the detectable number of spectra of neutrinos in this case .",
    "the vertical axis @xmath81 roughly corresponds to the detectable number in each energy range . in this case , the expectation value of neutrinos from kaons is 0.1 - 1 by a @xmath76 detector .",
    "however , for very high energy neutrinos , it may be possible to build detectors with effective volume orders of magnitude larger than @xmath76 , such as the extreme universe space observatory ( @xmath82 detector ) , because the earth is thick for such neutrinos . from the step - function - like features in the spectra",
    ", we can easily distinguish origins of neutrinos .    as shown in figures 3 and 4 ,",
    "@xmath5-decay neutrinos are dominant above @xmath83 ev , although the flux is too dim to detect on the earth . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution of @xmath5-decay in the energy band below @xmath83 ev is not so prominent .",
    "since we have considered many decaying modes , the production ratio of high - energy muon and electron neutrinos is not 2:1 exactly .",
    "however , the neutrinos will be almost equally distributed between flavors as a result of vacuum neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "so , there may be a possibility that tau neutrinos are detected through double - bang events  @xcite .",
    "as we have shown in this letter , the highest energy neutrinos may originate from kaons in grb internal shocks .",
    "the detection of such neutrinos is very important to prove the physical conditions in internal shocks and the particle acceleration theory . in order to observe such neutrinos ,",
    "a bright grb should occur at a very close distance , or amazing progress in the technology of neutrino observation is required .",
    "when we use the observed local grb rate , 0.4 gpc@xmath84 yr@xmath85 @xcite , the chance probability of having a source within 30mpc away from the earth is about 1 event per @xmath86 yr .",
    "however , the nearest burst ever observed is grb 980425 at 40 mpc , which was less luminous than usual bursts .",
    "although a grb at 30 mpc seems to be optimistic , we should prepare for an event beyond expectation , such as the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 @xcite .    as a rough standard",
    ", we have used a simple formula of the detection efficiency , extrapolating the case for upward - going neutrinos . however , in the very high energy band downward - going neutrinos are favorable to be detected rather than upward - going neutrinos , because the earth is thick for such neutrinos . for downward events , the detection efficiency of very high energy neutrinos",
    "would be enhanced .",
    "in addition it may be possible to build detectors with effective volume orders of magnitude larger than @xmath87 , which would enhance the chances of detection of the kaon decay neutrinos .",
    "the neutrinos produced from kaon decays may be detected as a neutrino background , so let us estimate the flux of the neutrino background roughly .",
    "it can be seen from figure 3 that the fluence of neutrinos @xmath88 at @xmath89 ev from this example is @xmath90 10@xmath91 gev .",
    "if we adopt this value , the resulting neutrino background level at @xmath89 ev is @xmath92 gev @xmath93 s@xmath85 sr@xmath85 , where we use the local grb rate , 0.4 gpc@xmath84 yr@xmath85 , without correction due to jet collimation @xcite and the age of the universe , @xmath94 yr .",
    "this background level is far below the detection limit expected from 3 years of icecube operation . since our example is an optimistic case for neutrino emission , a more realistic background level may become lower 1 or 2 orders of magnitude than above .",
    "dominant sources of background neutrinos in the highest energy band are not sure so far . if we can observe the background neutrinos at @xmath89 ev with a highly efficient detector in the future , the characteristic flat spectrum predicted from grb sources is distinguishable from spectra of other sources , such as grb early - afterglows or blazars ( see , e.g. , schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "@xcite showed that very high energy gamma rays from @xmath95-decay ( @xmath96 ev ) can escape from shells without electron - positron pair creation .",
    "however , this result largely depends on the assumption of spectra in the lower energy region .",
    "a recent observation @xcite shows brighter optical emission than @xcite assumed . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath5 also has some decaying modes into neutral pions .",
    "so , there is a possibility that delayed gamma rays come from the decays of @xmath5 .",
    "we can investigate the validity of this statement by checking whether @xmath5 can decay after grb photons escape from shells .",
    "since the mean lifetime of @xmath5 is 5.17@xmath97 s in the kaon rest frame , the mean lifetime of @xmath5 , @xmath98 , of energy @xmath99 in the shell rest frame becomes @xmath100 s. on the other hand , the typical dynamical timescale of grbs in the shell rest frame is 3 ( @xmath101)(@xmath102 ) s. so , we expect that gamma rays produced from kaons with energy larger than @xmath103 ev can escape from shells .",
    "of course , such gamma rays can not travel more than @xmath42 mpc because of electron - positron pair creation with a radio background @xcite .",
    "the secondary emission via inverse compton of cosmic microwave background photons may be observed as gev - tev photons .",
    "@xcite concluded that the corresponding time delays are in the range of 10 - 100 s and the duration timescale may be much longer .",
    "these timescales are much longer than the lifetime of @xmath5 in the observer s frame . therefore , unfortunately , the gev - tev secondary photons from kaons may not be distinguishable from other sources , such as @xmath95-decay .",
    "there is a possibility that failed grbs occur near / in our galaxy .",
    "as @xcite pointed out , for very extended or slowly rotating stars , the jet may be unable to break through the envelope of a massive star .",
    "however , penetrating and choked jets will produce , by photomeson interactions of accelerated protons , a burst of @xmath104 tev neutrinos while propagating in the envelope @xcite .",
    "such neutrinos from nearby galaxies may be detectable by a @xmath76 detector . in failed grbs",
    ", kaons may be also produced through the photomeson interactions @xcite .",
    "when these classes of grbs are taken into account , the chance probability of detecting neutrinos will be enhanced considerably . in previous works ,",
    "the neutrino spectrum was estimated assuming that the baryon density in the jet is sufficiently high that the @xmath1 process is the dominant process to produce neutrinos .",
    "however , the efficiency depends sensitively on the baryon density .",
    "so , there is a possibility that photomeson production becomes the dominant process to produce neutrinos in the failed grbs . in such a case",
    ", the spectrum of neutrinos will depend sensitively on the photon spectrum .",
    "so , the detection of high - energy neutrinos from such kaons will give us a clue to help understand the physical conditions of failed grbs , too .",

    "we appreciate that s. schadmand gave us information on the cross sections of pion production .",
