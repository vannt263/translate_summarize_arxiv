    "exact solutions of the einstein equations are associated to highly idealized physical systems that have some exceptional geometrical properties . in some cases with a simple exact solution one can capture a significant part of the physical properties of non trivial systems .",
    "also , in nonlinear theories like general relativity and fluid dynamics the exact solutions play an important role in numerical analysis .",
    "these solutions can be used to test numerical codes and its outcomes .",
    "also they can be employed as initial conditions to describe more realistic situations , e.g. , a static solution can be used as part of the initial conditions for a full dynamical simulation .",
    "since the natural shape of an isolated self - gravitating fluid is axially symmetric , the solutions of einstein s field equations with this symmetry play a particularly important role in the astrophysical applications of general relativity .",
    "in particular disk like configurations of matter are of great interest , since they can be used as models of galaxies or accretion disks .",
    "also these disks can be used as starting point to represent more realistic models in which the bulge and halo of the galaxy are considered .",
    "solutions for static thin disks without radial pressure were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite , and morgan and morgan @xcite , and with radial pressure by morgan and morgan @xcite .",
    "the first solution represent disks made of pressureless dust whereas the second disks with azimuthal pressure but without radial pressure . and",
    "the third a disk made of an anisotropic fluid with nonzero radial pressure .",
    "the bonnor - sackfield disk has a singular rim .",
    "these disks are finite .",
    "several classes of exact solutions of the einstein field equations corresponding to static @xcite and stationary @xcite thin disks have been obtained by different authors , with or without radial pressure .",
    "thin disks with radial tension @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite and magnetic and electric fields @xcite have been also studied .",
    "the non linear superposition of a disk and a black hole was first considered by lemos and letelier @xcite .",
    "this solution and its generalizations has been studied in some detail in @xcite .",
    "recently the stability of circular orbits of particles moving around black holes surrounded by axially symmetric structures have been considered in @xcite .",
    "for a recent survey on relativistic gravitating thin disks , see @xcite .    except for the pressureless disks all the other disks have as source matter with azimuthal pressure ( tension ) different from the radial pressure ( tension )",
    ". however , in some cases these disks can be interpreted as the superposition of two counter - rotating perfect fluids .",
    "a detailed study of the counter - rotating model for the case of static thin disks is presented in @xcite .",
    "recently , more realistic models of thin disks and thin disks with halos made of perfect fluids were considered in @xcite .    in all the disks mentioned above an inverse style method",
    "was used to solve the einstein equations .",
    "the metric representing the disk is guessed and then it is used to compute the source ( energy - momentum tensor ) .",
    "this method was named by synge as the g - method @xcite in contrast to the t - method or direct method in which the source is given and the einstein equations are solved .",
    "the t - method , has been used to generate disks by the jena group @xcite .",
    "essentially , they are obtained by solving a riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "these solutions are highly non trivial , but they deserve special attention because of their clear physical meaning .    in the solutions obtained by the g - method the well known `` displace , cut and reflect '' method is used .",
    "the idea of the method is simple .",
    "given a solution of the vacuum einstein equations , a cut is make above all singularities or sources .",
    "the identification of this solution with its mirror image yields relativistic models of disks . in general , these disks are of infinite extension and finite mass .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider disks beyond the thin disk limit to add a new degree of reality to these geometric models of galaxies .",
    "even though in first approximation the galactic disks can be considered to be very thin , e.g. , in our galaxy the radius of the disk is 10@xmath0 and its thickness is 1@xmath0 . in a more realistic model",
    "the thickness of the disk need to be considered .",
    "also it is well known in fluid mechanics that the addition of a new dimension can make dramatic changes in the dynamics of the fluid . in principle , this new dimension will also change the dynamical properties of the the disk source , e.g. , its stability .",
    "in this paper we generalize the `` displace , cut and reflect '' method in order to obtain thick disks models from vacuum solutions of einstein equations .",
    "we shall replace the surface of discontinuity of the metric derivatives with a `` thick '' shell in such a way that the matter content of the disk will be described by continuous functions with continuous first derivatives .",
    "this generalization can be named `` displace , cut , _ fill _ and reflect '' method .",
    "the disks obtained with this method , in general , will be of infinite extension and finite mass .",
    "also as in the case of thin disks , the matter that form the thick disks will not obey simple equations of state and in some regions of the disk the pressure can change sign given rise to tensions . although the energy condition will be fulfilled .",
    "the models of thick disks presented can be considered as generalizations of models of thin disks studied in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the article is divided as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present , in some detail , the main idea of the `` displace , cut , _ fill _ and reflect '' method in newtonian gravity .",
    "the method is then applied , in sec .",
    "iii , to construct relativistic thick disks in weyl coordinates .",
    "we also study the general expression for the energy - momentum tensor of the disks .",
    "the method is illustrated by taking two simple weyl solutions that lead to thick disks in agreement with all the energy - conditions . in sec .",
    "iv we apply the method to the schwarzschild solution in isotropic cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the disk obtained also satisfy all the energy conditions , this disk have equal azimuthal and radial pressures and different vertical pressure . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we summarize our main results .",

    "the method can be divided in the following steps : first , choose a surface that divides the usual space in two parts : one with no singularities or sources an the other with the sources .",
    "second , disregard the part of the space with singularities .",
    "third , use the surface to make an inversion of the nonsingular part of the space .",
