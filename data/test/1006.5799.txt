    "radiation from extragalactic objects is generally reduced and attenuated the galactic interstellar dust . as the dust extinction is high in the ultraviolet(uv )  optical wavelength region , the observed data at these wavelengths must be corrected for the galactic extinction along each line of sight .",
    "for example , statistical analyses of galaxies using the sloan digital sky survey ( e.g. , york et al .",
    "2000 ) require an accurate extinction map .",
    "schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) ( hereafter sfd98 ) have made an all - sky map of the galactic extinction for this purpose by using the all - sky far - infrared maps of the infrared astronomy satellite ( _ iras _ ) and the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) on the cosmic background explorer ( _ cobe _ ) .",
    "to derive extinctions , the dust size is important ; it the dust size is classified into three groups ( e.g. , dsert et al .",
    "1990 ) : polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) , very small grain ( vsg ) , and large grain ( lg ) .",
    "lg absorbs uv - optical photons and reradiates the absorbed energy in far infrared ( fir ) .",
    "the observed fir emission is dominated by lgs ( e.g. , sodroski et al .",
    "lg considered to be in equilibrium with the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) ( e.g. , draine & anderson 1985 ) and radiates thermal emission with an equilibrium temperature .",
    "therefore , assuming a spectral emissivity index , the dust temperature and the optical thickness can be derived from the fir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "we can derive the dust extinction in the uv and optical wavelength regions from the fir sed if the dust optical depth of lg is proportional to the extinction of each grain component ( pah+vsg+lg ) .",
    "pah and vsg , in contrast to lg , are heated stochastically by a single photon to high temperatures and cooled by radiation shorter than 60 @xmath3 m . as a significant fraction of the 60 @xmath3 m intensity usually comes from vsgs , we can not derive the lg temperature from the _ iras _ 60 and 100 @xmath3 m band data ( e.g. dsert et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "furthermore , there are two all - sky fir diffuse maps obtained by ( _ iras _ ) and dirbe . _",
    "iras _ has two fir photometric bands of 60 and 100 @xmath3 m , while dirbe has four fir photometric bands of 60 , 100 , 140 , and 240 @xmath3 m .",
    "the spatial resolution of dirbe is 0@xmath2.7 , whereas that of _ iras _ is 5@xmath0 .",
    "sfd98 derived the dust temperature from dirbe data at 100 and 240 @xmath3 m , and published the all - sky extinction ( reddening ) map .",
    "they made an extinction map with 5@xmath0 resolution using the temperature derived from dirbe and the 100 @xmath3 m intensity of _",
    "iras_. because the spatial resolution is limited by dirbe , this extinction map may not trace small - scale variation as pointed out by arce & goodman ( 1999 ) .",
    "dobashi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) made a visual extinction map with 6 @xmath0 resolution using the digitized sky survey ( dss ) . since the star counting technique can not measure the dust behind the stars , its accuracy can worsen in directions where the extinction is high , depending on many parameters such as the angular density of stars , their location from the molecular cloud , and the distribution of the distances of the dust",
    "therefore , this technique may be ineffective for the correction of the galactic extinction towards extragalactic objects near the galactic plane .",
    "to improve the maps , we assumed the color - color correlations between 60 , 100 , and 140 @xmath3 m that were found by hibi et al .",
    "they analyzed zodi - subtracted mission average ( zsma ) data of the galactic plane within @xmath6 , lmc , and smc .",
    "they identified two groups having very tight correlations in the color - color diagram .",
    "these correlations are not produced with the model by li & draine ( 2002 ) .",
    "bot et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also argued that the model by draine & li ( 2007 ) does not explain the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) and _ iras _ data .    by using hibi et al.s correlation ,",
    "we can obtain the dust temperature and the dust extinction with 5@xmath0 resolution only from the _ iras _ data . to test the validity of this method of making a high - resolution dust extinction map ,",
    "we have analyzed the cygnus region . in this paper , we report the results of our analysis and compare them with those of sfd98 and dobashi et al .",
    "the data and the analysis method are shown in section 2 .",
    "the temperature and extinction maps are presented in section 3 .",
    "we discuss the results in section 4 .",
    "section 5 presents to the summary .",
    "in this section , the intensity at 140 @xmath3 m is derived from the intensities at 60 and 100 @xmath3 m of the _ iras _ data by using the tight correlation between 60 , 100 , and 140 @xmath3 m found by hibi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . to test this method , we selected a sample area in the cygnus region .",
    "the selected area is 80@xmath2 to 90@xmath2 in the galactic longitude and @xmath7 to @xmath8 in the galactic latitude .",
    "the interplanetary dust ( ipd ) emission and the cosmic infrared background possibly contaminate the galactic diffuse emission ( e.g. , sodroski et al .",
    "however , as the cygnus region is located at 60@xmath2 in the ecliptic latitude , the subtraction of the ipd component has only a minor contribution to the uncertainty about our derivation of extinction discussed later .",
    "the cosmic infrared background emission is negligible , since the fir intensity is high enough .    in general",
    ", the interstellar space in the galaxy is optically thin in the fir wavelength region .",
    "the fir intensity is written by @xmath9 in equation ( 1 ) , @xmath10 is the intensity at wavelength @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the optical depth at 100 @xmath3 m , @xmath13 is the dust temperature , and @xmath14 is the spectral emissivity index .",
    "@xmath15 is the planck function .",
    "hereafter , @xmath16 is described as @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath17 is not color - corrected .",
    "the color - corrected intensity , @xmath18 , is described below .",
    "we adopted a one - zone model , i.e. , the dust temperature is assumed to be constant along each line of sight .",
    "we adopted @xmath19 according to the previous study ( drain & lee 1984 , hibi et al .",
    "2006 , sfd98 ) for comparison .",
    "some observational results show that @xmath14 changes depending on the physical status of the ism ( e.g. , reach et al .",
    "1995 and del burgo et al .",
    "2003 ) .    because the published dirbe all - bands intensities were derived by assuming a source spectrum , @xmath20 = constant , the color correction should be applied to the observed data with the photometric bands of dirbe .",
    "the color correction factor @xmath21 is determined from the spectral emissivity index and the dust temperature , if the spectrum is written by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the conversion from the observed ( uncorrected ) intensity to the color - corrected intensity is given by equation ( 2 ) with the color correction factor @xmath22 the color correction factor of dirbe is quoted from the _ cobe_/dirbe explanatory supplement ( 1995 ) .",
    "the color correction was made for the intensity at 140 and 100 @xmath3 m , but not for that at 60 @xmath3 m , because the sed shape around 60 @xmath3 m can not be described by equation ( 1 ) ( hibi et al .",
    "the correction affects the intensities by a few percent and hence is not crucial for the degree of extinction derived later .",
    "the color - color diagram was made from the dirbe data in the cygnus region using the same procedure as hibi et al .",
    "hibi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) indicated that there were two tight correlations in the galactic plane .",
    "the major group is called the main - correlation , and the minor group the sub - correlation . the main - correlation and the sub - correlation",
    "are fitted with equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 @xmath24 hibi et al .  (",
    "2006 ) and hirashita et al .",
    "( 2007 ) indicated that the main - correlation represents the lines of sight along which the isrf is constant , and the sub - correlation represents the lines of sight along which the isrf varies greatly .",
    "the color - color diagram of the cygnus region is shown in figure 1 .",
    "in contrast to the galactic plane , the data points satisfying @xmath25 do not follow the main - correlation and other data points seem to follow the sub - correlation with a small offset .",
    "therefore , we tried to fit the data points in two regions divided at @xmath26 . least - squares fitting with two parameters of power and offset in the color - color diagram provided the following two relationships :    @xmath27    @xmath28    the coefficients of correlations of the former and latter cases are 0.7 and 0.8 , respectively .",
    "there are 653 and 495 data points for the regions of @xmath25 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we calculate @xmath30 only from @xmath31 and @xmath32 for four cases listed in table 1 in addition to the sfd98 method . at first",
    ", we use equation ( 6 ) for all data points , and call this the single case . as shown in figure 1 , this relation is similar to the sub - correlation , and approximately represents all the data points .",
    "however , the scatter of the data points around the lines of equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) does not reflect the noise included in the dirbe s individual data points but actual variation .",
    "the noise level of dirbe140 is 2 mjy / sr ( _ cobe_/dirbe explanatory supplement 1995 ) .",
    "actually , the rms noise of dirbe140 is 2 mjy / sr in the high latitude sky ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "as the lowest intensity is 30 mjy / sr in the present analysis of the cygnus region , the noise does not contribute to the scatter in figure 1 .",
    "the noise levels of dirbe60 and dirbe100 are negligible compared to the intensities at those bands",
    ". therefore the scatter should be actual variation , the fitting with a single line as above introduces an additional error into the estimation of temperature .",
    "therefore , we adopted the following method for the latter three cases . each data point in figure 1 was plotted from the dirbe data with poor spatial resolution .",
    "sfd98 determined the dust temperature only from dirbe100 and dirbe140 , and thus , small - scale variation of the dust temperature was smeared out . on the other hand , we can use iras60 and iras100 with better spatial resolution , and we are aware of the reasonably good correlations . therefore",
    ", we initially plotted a single line with the same inclination as that of equation ( 5 ) or ( 6 ) just at the data point plotted based on the dirbe .",
    "next , we apply the ratio of iras60 and iras100 to the vertical axis of figure 1 to determine the ratio of iras100 intensity and the @xmath34 intensity .",
    "equation ( 7 ) indicates this method .",
    "@xmath35    the power @xmath36 is -0.75 and -0.44 .",
    "according to the correlation recognized in figure 1 , we adopted three cases as in table 1 : inclination of equation ( 5 ) , inclination of equation ( 6 ) , and a combination of both inclinations .",
    "we call the case of @xmath37 the slow case and the case of @xmath38 the steep case .",
    "the last case is called the best - fit case that changes the power according to equation ( 8) for better fitting ;    @xmath39    this new method , corresponding to the latter three cases , is based on the fact that the scatter around a single fitted line may represent some actual variation and there may still remain a correlation with a similar inclination around each data point .",
    "it can be interpreted that sfd98 adopted a vertical line at each data point for the derivation of the temperature in figure 1 , whereas the latter three cases of the present study adopted a tilted line at each data point representing the actual correlation found by hibi et al .",
    "the scatter from equation ( 5 ) or ( 6 ) produces no error .",
    "the dirbe data were re - gridded from @xmath40 pixels to 5@xmath0 pixels , the same as those of _ iras _ with the sphere - approximation interpolation . as a result of this transformation , @xmath41 of each pixel",

    "the best - fit is represented by the combination of the steep case and the slow case at @xmath42 .",
    "the difference between the present method and sfd98 appears in the difference between the inclinations of lines .",
    "the deviation of @xmath42 of the _ iras _ data from that of the dirbe data is reflected for @xmath43 that corresponds to the dust temperature .",

    "the methods using the best - fit and steep cases are considered to be more precise than the sfd98 method because of the following reason .",
    "as described in section 3 , the @xmath4 map derived by the best - fit differs from that by sfd98 , and the difference can be ascribed to the fact that the present temperature map has higher spatial resolution compared with that of sfd98 .",

    "figure 10 shows the comparison between @xmath4 ( best ) and @xmath4 ( slow ) .",
    "it can be seen that the difference is large compared to the noise of the dirbe data points , reflecting the fact that the power of the slow case does not represent the entire correlation in the cygnus region .",
