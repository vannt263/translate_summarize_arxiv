    "the use of adiabatic passage ( ap ) @xcite to form ultracold molecules by photoassociating ultracold atoms @xcite with resonantly enhanced anti - stokes raman ( rear ) pulses in counter - intuitive ordering is an attractive idea , mainly due to the promise of high yield .",
    "central to the ap process is the formation of a `` dark state '' i.e. , a light - dressed state that once formed , is impervious to further actions of the light fields . when the light fields are applied as pulses , ap results from the dark state changing its nature by following the makeup of the applied pulses from that of the input state ( scattering state ) to the desired final state ( molecular bound state ) .    unlike in conventional bound - bound ap ( e.g. stirap ) @xcite ,",
    "the input state in the photoassociation is not a pure state , but a thermal mixture of states .",
    "it can be represented as an incoherent mixture of different energy eigenstates , where the scenario of coherent manipulation proposed here works with similar efficiency for any initial energy within the thermal spread of the initial ensemble .",
    "alternatively , the input state can be represented as a mixture gaussian wave packets localized in phase space .",
    "the applied laser pulses in our scheme are not much longer than the coherence time of the thermal ensemble , which is equivalent to the average collision time of the coherent wave packets . within the coherence time - window",
    "all initial states behave alike , and the coherent manipulation with these states succeeds .",
    "another difference between ap from the continuum and conventional three - level stirap due to the dynamical nature of the continuum is that while in stirap the input state can be completely transferred into the final state , in photoassociation this is not possible ( only a small fraction of the atoms are colliding at a given time ) .",
    "here however , the continuum serves as a coherent source / sink of population that is coupled by the light fields to the bound molecular states . by applying the coherent pulses over and over on the thermal ensemble of atoms , the overall photoassociation yield , which is an incoherent sum of yields from individual pulse sets , can approach unity on a reasonable time scale .",
    "although dark states connecting continuum and bound states have now been observed experimentally @xcite , photoassociation adiabatic passage ( pap ) has not been realized so far .",
    "the main reason is that adiabaticity implies large `` rabi - frequencies '' , which , due to the weakness of the bound continuum dipole - matrix - elements ( controlled by the franck - condon ( fc ) shape factors ) , imply the use of high intensity pulses .",
    "the production of high intensity in conjunction with relatively long pulse durations is not so easy to achieve in practice .",
    "in addition , the exact values of the pulse parameters are still under study @xcite .",
    "this paper describes a set of realistic calculations of the @xmath0rb+@xmath0rb @xmath8 @xmath0rb@xmath1 photoassociation in an attempt to determine the pulse parameters needed to bring about pap for this system .",
    "we use two pairs of pulses : the first of these pairs transfers the population from continuum to the fourth excited state of the @xmath9 of rb@xmath1 ( rear ) .",
    "the second pair transfers the population to the ground vibrational state ( conventional stirap ) .",
    "special care is taken of averaging over the thermal ensemble of colliding atoms at 100 @xmath5k temperature , employing the laser pulses that photoassociate most initial states in the ensemble .",
    "we find that with sensible laser parameters photoassociation at a rate of @xmath10 per pulse is possible , which reflects the limit set by the sample density and temperature .",
    "accordingly , photoassociation of a major fraction of the ensemble can be achieved by repeating the pulse sequence @xmath2 times . in order to avoid excitation of the created molecules by subsequent pulses",
    "it is necessary to either remove them from the beam path or `` hide '' them via an irreversible process ( e.g. spontaneous emission ) .",
    "we discuss both the possibility of using a slowly moving optical lattice to remove the molecules form the laser focus , and a method involving spontaneous decay from an excited molecular state . in the case of photoassociation of high phase - space density sample",
    ", it must be possible to photo - associate the whole sample with a single pulse sequence .",
    "for notational simplicity we henceforth denote the @xmath11 electronic state as `` x '' , and the spin - orbit - coupled @xmath12 and @xmath13 potentials as `` a / b '' .",

    "the pair of pulses consists of a pump pulse , which couples the x - continuum to one of the a / b - bound states , and an anti - stokes dump pulse , which couples this a / b - bound state to an excited x - vibrational state . a second , much weaker , pair of pulses , can transfers ( again by rear , which in this case reduces to the bound - bound stirap @xcite ) the population from the excited x - vibrational state to the ground vibrational state .",

    "in contrast , as the energy of the a / b states is increased , the x and a / b phase space trajectories start to overlap , thereby increasing the continuum - bound fc factors to several a.u .",
    "the pap scheme is expected to work conveniently for transitions to bound states lying in the vicinity of the a / b@xmath14 level ( @xmath23 a.u . ) .",

    "the advantage here is that the continuum - bound fc factors associated with these states are higher by two or three orders in magnitude relative to the a / b@xmath14 region , allowing for the use of much weaker pump lasers .",

    "the fc factor for the transition from the state x(@xmath27 ) onto a / b(@xmath147 ) is equal to 0.174 , and so a picosecond - long pulse of the intensity @xmath154 w/@xmath84 can transfer all the population from x(@xmath27 ) onto a / b(@xmath147 ) . the sharp maximum at the fc factor corresponding to the transition between the states a / b(@xmath147 ) and x(@xmath155 ) ( @xmath156 a.u . )",
    "ensures that about 25% of the population decaying from the state a / b(@xmath147 ) is accumulated at the state x(@xmath155 ) , while the neighboring vibrational states are barely populated .",
    "indeed , an additional stirap implemented after the photoassociation is completed , can transfer all the population accumulated at x(@xmath155 ) onto x(@xmath26 ) .",
    "our estimates are to be compared with the results on creation of ground state molecules with cw lasers . in the experiment @xcite",
    ", vibrationally cold ground state molecules were created with the estimated rate of about 500 molecules per second ( since the molecules were not trapped , the actual detection rate was lower ) .",
    "this value can be , in principle , increased ; there is a constraint on the effectiveness of the cw photoassociation lying in the fact that it incoherently populates many highly excited vibrational states , as well as the molecular continuum . in the experiment @xcite",
    ", vibrationally hot ground state molecules were created with a rate of @xmath157 molecules per second for many vibrational levels .",
    "although in this experiment the molecules in the state @xmath26 were not detected , it was concluded that their production rate is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the scheme discussed in the previous paragraph can be viewed as an extension of the two - step schemes of refs .",
    "@xcite to the case when the first step is made with the help of the stirap - like pap sequence .",
    "the high efficiency appearing in our theoretical estimates comes from the fact that pap with correctly chosen parameters is assumed to waste no molecules either in the continuum or in the manifold of molecular bound states .",
    "the estimate ( [ estimate ] ) trivially scales with the temperature and the density of the atomic sample . in the case of photoassociation at either bec @xcite or mott insulator @xcite conditions",
    "one can hope to photo - associate the whole sample with a single sequence of pulses .     in photoassociation of a coherent wave packet in dependence on the pump pulse intensity . ]    unlike bound - bound stirap , the continuum - bound rear process continues to work even if the laser intensity is not sufficient for the complete population transfer .",
    "this can be seen from eq.([svca-2 ] ) . apart from modifying the rate of decay of the intermediate level",
    ", the pump rabi frequency @xmath158 enters the schroedinger equation only in combination with the initial continuum envelope @xmath159 . reducing the pump rabi frequency",
    "is roughly equivalent to reducing the amplitude of the initial scattering state , and does not influence the passage itself .",
    "we repeated the calculation presented in fig .",
    "[ figcoherentpa ] for a set of the pump intensities below and above @xmath92 w/@xmath84 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - weakfield ] .",
    "as expected , the photoassociation probability at low intensities roughly scales as square root of the intensity . in each simulation",
    "the probability of populating the intermediate a / b@xmath14 state was much lower than the final photoassociation probability , and the general time dependance of the bound state populations was similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ figcoherentpa ] .",
    "thus even in situations when the fc factors are too low for the complete population transfer , a rear photoassotiating pulse pair allows to scoop from the continuum a part of its population , and to transfer it , almost without losses , onto the bound molecular state .",
    "we have demonstrated that one can implement ap in photoassociation in a thermal ensemble of cold atoms .",
    "ap is best implemented when the bandwidths of the laser pulses involved are slightly narrower than the energy spread of the ensemble . in this way",
    ", the rear process works for any initial continuum energy .    the number of pulses needed to complete the photoassociation depends only on the ratio between the coherence time and the average time between s - wave collisions .",
    "our estimate for the number of pulses needed to photoassociate an entire ensemble of 100 @xmath5k rb atoms at density of @xmath6 @xmath121 is @xmath160 .",
    "the exact number can vary depending on whether one photoassociates atoms colliding on the singlet ( as we have done ) or the triplet potential surfaces .",
    "the requirement that the photoassociating pulse sequence works the same way for all the initial energies in the ensemble is generic for any coherent photoassociation scheme .",
    "if simple laser pulses are used , this means that the pulse durations must not exceed the coherence time in the ensemble by much .",
    "the ap sequence considered in this paper photoassociates almost all the continuum population that passes through the fc region during the coherence time window .",
    "thus , for simple - structured pulses , the ap sequence places the upper boundary on what is possible to achieve .",
    "use of more complex pulse shapes , such as the numerically optimized shapes in ref .",
    "@xcite , is limited in our scheme by the requirement that the laser spectrum be smooth on the scale of the ensemble thermal energy spread .",
    "we conducted our simulations for singlet collisions of rb@xmath161 atoms . due to the pole in the scattering length ,",
    "the fc factors are strongly enhanced , and the required intensities are quite low .",
    "the scheme needs @xmath92 w/@xmath84 intensity for the continuum - bound 1063.4 nm pump pulse ; all the other intensities are adjustable , and are below this number .",
    "once the continuum state is transferred onto a vibrationally excited bound state of the ground electronic surface , it is relatively easy to employ another pulse sequence transferring the population to the ground ro - vibrational state .",
    "this can be done either as a coherent transition driven by a second ap pulse pair , or by employing incoherent decay from an excited electronic state of the molecule . in the first case ,",
    "one creates vibrationally cold molecules , which have to be removed from the laser focus before the next photoassociating pulse pair arrives . in the second case , vibrationally",
    "hot molecules in the ground electronic state can be accumulated in the laser focus .    in an analogy with weak - field coherent control ( cc ) @xcite , interference of quantum pathways for the system following several dark states can either enhance or suppress the probability of photoassociation . combining the vast possibilities of coherent control with the ability to adiabatically transfer 100% of quantum population into the desired state @xcite would give a powerful tool for quantum engineering .",
    "progress in this direction has been made in controlling bound - bound population transfer @xcite .",
    "we have numerically investigated the dark state interference for free - bound transitions , for two basic configurations involving an initial continuum  the `` double-@xmath162 '' ( pap via two different intermediate states ) and the `` tripod '' ( pap into a superposition of two final states ) linkages . in both cases the branching ratios and the effectiveness of the population transfer for the continuum - bound processes coincided with those expected from the bound - bound multi - pathway stirap @xcite .",
    "coherently controlled adiabatic passage , if implemented in photoassociation , can provide the means to implement a number of exciting schemes based on the continuum - bound pathway interference . as an example , it is possible to measure the multi - channel continuum state in the trap by photoassociating a desired multi - channel wave packet ( such as either even or odd superposition of single - channel components , either even or odd temporal structure , etc . ) at a given moment and leaving aside all orthogonal waveforms @xcite .",
    "some work in this direction will be presented elsewhere .",
