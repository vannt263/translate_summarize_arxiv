    "the recent observations of and scalability concerns with the dynamics of the bgp routing table size growth , @xcite , bring up the question of how small the routing table sizes for distributed routing on realistic massive graphs can be made _ in principle_. in other words , what are the _ fundamental _ limits of compactness of graph - theoretic routing in such networks ?    answering this question involves two things .",
    "on one hand , it calls for assessment of results obtained in the area of distributed routing . since our first interest is the lower limits that can be achieved _ in principle _",
    ", we are more concerned with idealized _ static _ routing in this paper .",
    "being the simplest and most fundamental routing model , static routing is where such limits can manifest themselves . in the more complicated dynamic case",
    ", these limits can only be higher .",
    "on the other hand , answering the above question also requires understanding of the basic properties of _ realistic _ massive growing networks , the internet being a good example of those .",
    "the structure and evolution of these networks are subjects of intensive studies these days .      the above two research fields virtually do not intersect .",
    "we are not aware of any routing schemes designed specifically for scale - free graphs , and , vice versa , the literature concerned with the properties of scale - free nets has not addressed the routing problem yet .",
    "we tend to explain this lack of overlapping by the fact that understanding of the nature of large networks observed in reality started just recently .",
    "we review the results relevant to our work in the two separate subsections .      since the pioneering work by kleinrock and kamoun , @xcite , the trade - off between stretch and the amount of routing information ( i.e.  memory space ) required by a routing scheme has been understood , analyzed , and improved .",
    "many relatively recent `` internet routing architecture '' proposals , @xcite , are based on the ideas of @xcite .",
    "since @xcite was the first work of its type , it is not surprising that nave routing based on it would generate stretch that is far from optimal .",
    "indeed , the simple calculations presented in appendix [ sec : kk_stretch ] show that the stretch produced by @xcite on the present internet interdomain graph would be of the order of 10 .    however , the high value of stretch was not the central problem with @xcite .",
    "this work along with the works that closely followed it , @xcite , concentrated on optimal hierarchical network clustering ( splitting into areas ) satisfying a set of assumptions , but no proof of existence of such clustering for generic graphs and no algorithm to find it when it exists were obtained . while several subsequent works tried to overcome these problems , all known hierarchical routing schemes eventually turned out to be inferior with respect to more recent _ direct _ routing schemes .    in the work by peleg and upfal , @xcite , the trade - off between memory space and stretch for _ generic _ networks was rigourously analyzed for the first time .",
    "the work contained several issues that were addressed in many publications that followed @xcite .",
    "one of the issues was that only the total ( per network ) space was bounded , the local ( per node ) space was unbounded .",
    "another issue was that the scheme required relabelling of nodes .",
    "the fact that useful information about network topology can be embedded in node labels to reduce the space is most easily seen in the case of ring networks , where the local lower bound for shortest path routing is @xmath8 if relabelling is not allowed , and @xmath9 if nodes on the ring can be labelled sequentially .",
    "the most efficient label set for an @xmath10-node network is obviously @xmath11$].$ ] label set is relevant to a specific terminology used in the routing literature .",
    "the common term `` routing table '' denotes a direct routing scheme with labels from this set .",
    "] the fundamental lower bound is obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is shown there that if the label space is @xmath11 $ ] , then , for _ any _ stretch ( including shortest path routing ) , there can not exist a loop - free generic routing scheme that would guarantee the local space less then @xmath12 .    for _ shortest path _ routing ,",
    "the lower bound turns out to be higher .",
    "the pessimistic but intuitively expected results obtained in @xcite show that for _ any _ stretch-1 routing scheme , there exists a graph with maximum node degree @xmath13 , @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 bits of memory are required at @xmath16 nodes .",
    "since the trivial upper bound for shortest path routing is also @xmath17 , @xcite effectively demonstrates _ incompressibility _ of generic shortest path routing .",
    "fortunately , the majority of graphs are slightly better . applying the kolmogorov complexity theory to routing",
    ", the authors of @xcite provide many upper and lower bounds for _ almost all _ graphs .",
    "in particular , for shortest path routing , not more than @xmath18 ( but not less than @xmath19 ) bits per node are shown to be enough for the @xmath20 portion of all @xmath11$]-labelled graphs .",
    "if labelling is relaxed to allow for @xmath21-sized labels , then the local memory space upper bound is reduced to @xmath21 .",
    "the question about the space lower bound for stretch-1 routing on almost all graphs with free relabelling remains open .    while the results from the complexity theory or classical random graph theory ( @xcite ) for almost all graphs may induce some optimism , very little can be said , on the practical side , about if all the graphs from a given class of graphs are good or bad with respect to routing compactness .",
    "exploring specifics of various graph families , a number of compact routing schemes for special types of graphs have been constructed .",
    "there are several results for rings , complete networks , trees , grids , decomposable , planar , outplanar , bounded genus , chordal , etc . , graphs ,",
    "but none so far for scale - free graphs ( even in the `` almost all '' context ) .",
    "it is easy to explain since the properties of scale - free networks from the graph - theoretic perspective are not fully understood yet .",
    "thus , the only currently existing tool to analyze the limits of compactness of routing on scale - free networks is generic routing schemes .",
    "generic shortest path routing is incompressible , which means that if the memory space is to be reduced , then the stretch must be increased .",
    "the memory space lower bound dependence on stretch is not `` continuous . '' as shown in @xcite , any generic routing scheme with the maximum stretch strictly less than @xmath22 must use at least @xmath23 bits of memory on some nodes of some graphs . in other words ,",
    "the lower bound for generic schemes with stretch @xmath24 is the same as in the incompressible case of shortest path routing ( consider the bound of @xmath15 discussed above and take @xmath25 ) .",
    "furthermore , as shown in @xcite , the lower bound for schemes with stretch strictly less than @xmath26 is nearly the same as for shortest path routing@xmath8 bits of memory on some nodes of some graphs .",
    "the minimum stretch factor that allows for significant memory space lower bound decrease is 3 .",
    "cowen introduces a very simple direct stretch-3 routing scheme with the local memory space upper bound of @xmath27 in @xcite .",
    "the scheme uses relabelling , and labels are of size @xmath28 . in @xcite ,",
    "thorup and zwick improve cowen s result and deliver a local space upper bound of @xmath29 .",
    "they also show how to implement routing decisions at _ constant _ time per node and to reduce the label size to @xmath30 .",
    "we call the above two stretch-3 schemes the _ cowen _ and _ thorup - zwick _ ( tz ) schemes respectively .",
    "the local memory space upper bound provided by the tz scheme is nearly ( up to a logarithmic factor ) optimal ( best possible ) since , as demonstrated in @xcite , any generic routing scheme with stretch strictly less than @xmath31 must use at least @xmath32 bits of memory on some nodes of some graphs ( see table [ table : stretch_1 - 3 - 5 ] ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the tz scheme is the single generic stretch-3 routing scheme delivering a nearly optimal local memory upper bound today .",
    "this makes it `` exceptional '' in a sense that it delivers a nearly optimal first possibility to decrease the local space down from the shortest path routing incompressible limits .",
    "this also explains why it is a primary subject of our present work .",
    ".total space lower bounds for low stretch values .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the results in the previous sections suggest that the average stretch depends more strongly on the characteristics of the graph distance distribution ( on its first and second moments , in particular ) than on the graph size .",
    "more specifically , we are taking the distance distribution in a graph to be gaussian , ( [ gaussian - pdf - norm ] ) , and , hence , the average tz stretch @xmath33 in ( [ stretch - average ] ) is a function of the average distance  @xmath6 and the width of the distance distribution  @xmath7 in a graph , @xmath34 . at this point",
    ", we wish to explore the analytical structure of @xmath35 in more detail .",
    "the natural starting point is to fix either @xmath6 or @xmath7 in @xmath35 to their observed values , @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively , and to consider two functions , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : minimum](a , b ) . to our great surprise",
    ", we discover that these two functions have _ unique minimums _ and that the points corresponding to the internet distance distribution ( or , simply , the _ internet points _ ) are _ very close _ to them . in other words ,",
    "one may get an impression that the internet topology has been carefully crafted to result in a distance distribution that would minimize the average tz stretch .",
    "of course , this can be only an impression and not an explanation since the internet evolution has had nothing to do with stretch .",
    "the next question we have to ask is if the minimums we observe in fig .  [ fig : minimum](a , b ) correspond to a true local minimum of @xmath35 . our analytical results allow us to collect enough data to draw fig .",
    "[ fig : minimum](c ) , where the stretch function @xmath35 is shown for @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "note that not all regions of @xmath41 correspond to gaussian - like distance distributions .",
    "indeed , when @xmath42 , distribution @xmath43 from ( [ gaussian - pdf - norm ] ) looks more like an exponential decay since it is cut off from the left by condition @xmath44 .",
    "also , when @xmath7 is very small and the continuous form of the gaussian distribution approaches a @xmath45-function , its discrete form ( [ gaussian - pdf - norm ] ) goes to either a constant , @xmath46}$ ] , when @xmath47 , or to a sum of two constants with equal weights , @xmath48 , when @xmath49 .",
    "this explains the peculiar peak formation in the @xmath50 area in the picture ( see also appendix  [ sec : minimum_analysis ] ) .",
    "networks with such distance distributions are easily constructible ( complete networks , stars , various forms of their interconnections , etc . ) .",
    "they all have regular structure , and the exact knowledge of their structure is required for precise stretch calculations .",
    "this is why our analytical approach is slightly off in giving the precise answer for stars ( @xmath51 instead of 1 for @xmath52 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "note , however , that for the single case when @xmath7 is allowed to be strictly 0 , that is , for the complete network case , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , we obtain the correct answer for the average stretch , 2 .",
    "the @xmath41-region for distance distributions in realistic networks is , thus , @xmath55 , where we observe a concave area in a form of channel , fig .",
    "[ fig : minimum](c ) .",
    "the area is characterized by particularly low stretch values , which makes us call it the _ minimal stretch region _ ( the msr ) .",
    "the width and depth of the msr slowly _ increase _ as @xmath41 grow . in the area of smaller @xmath41 ,",
    "the msr has a unique critical point , which we call the _",
    "msr apex_. the internet point is located very close to the apex , which is characterized by the shortest distance between the sets of minimums of @xmath33along the @xmath6- and @xmath7-axes .",
    "we may express these sets as two functions , which we denote as @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "we find that @xmath58 and @xmath59 _ almost touch _ each other at the apex .",
    "since the intersection of these two functions would correspond to a stationary point of @xmath35 , we call the apex a _ quasi - stationary _ point emphasizing that the both derivatives of @xmath35 are _ nearly _ zero at this point .",
    "the apex can be more easily observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : minimum](d ) showing a projection of fig .",
    "[ fig : minimum](c ) on the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane .",
    "the solid lines representing the above two sets of minimums forming the msr , almost touch each other near the apex , and the internet point is very near their closest segment .    an opportunity to look at the apex from yet another angle",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : minimum](e ) showing a projection of fig .",
    "[ fig : minimum](c ) on the @xmath6-@xmath33 plane .",
    "we see that starting from the apex , as  @xmath6 increases , the stretch values along @xmath58 and @xmath59 become virtually equal and slowly _ decrease _ as the average distance grows .",
    "we also note that @xmath60 graphs are far away from the apex and that they have average stretch values that are far from minimal .",
    "we can see now that the apex is indeed a critical or `` phase transition '' point since it is located at the boundary of the two regions of the average stretch function .",
    "the first region , the msr , is characterized by lowest possible stretch values corresponding to distance distributions observed in real - world graphs .",
    "the second region , with substantially higher average stretch values , corresponds to distance distributions in more regular graphs .    to illustrate this point in more detail",
    ", we turn our attention back to fig .",
    "[ fig : minimum](d ) .",
    "we see that the two sets of minimums , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , are linear in the msr with sufficiently large @xmath7 , @xmath61 , where the continuous approximation of the distance distribution works particularly well .",
    "the two top dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : minimum](d ) represent the linear fits of @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the area with @xmath61 .",
    "the exact location of the intersection of these fits is @xmath62 , while the two closest points on the data curves for @xmath58 and @xmath59 are @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "if the linear form of @xmath58 and @xmath59 sustained in the area with smaller @xmath7 as well , then @xmath58 and @xmath59 would intersect at @xmath65 , where we would observe a true stationary point of @xmath35 , which we could then test for the presence of an extremum of the stretch function .",
    "this does not happen , however .",
    "instead , as @xmath6 and @xmath7 become small , the linear behavior breaks near the apex due to increasingly `` more discrete '' structure of the distance distribution .",
    "see more on this in appendix  [ sec : minimum_analysis ] .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : minimum_analysis ] , we show that linearity of @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be analytically derived from the fact that the distance distribution is taken to be gaussian .",
    "of course , this does not explain why the _ internet _ point is so close either to the msr or to its apex .",
    "the linear form of @xmath58 and @xmath59 sheds some light on a closely related issue of why the average stretch is virtually independent of @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : minimum](d ) , the shaded area represents a set of @xmath41 , for which the average stretch is approximately the same as for the internet , @xmath66 . in other words , it is a projection of the cyan area in fig .",
    "[ fig : minimum](c ) on the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane .",
    "we see that in the msr , the @xmath67 boundaries are almost parallel straight lines . therefore , if the average stretch is to be independent of @xmath1 , which is observed in section  [ sec : stretch_distribution ] , then the points representing distance distributions in power - law graphs , @xmath68 , from fig .",
    "[ fig : dd](b ) should lie along the @xmath67 boundaries , and this is what indeed happens . yet again , the linear relation between @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the power - law graphs , and the fact that this relation is just as required for the average tz stretch being virtually independent of @xmath1 , come from two seemingly disjoint domains .",
    "to finish the list of various `` coincidences , '' we construct a linear fit of ( @xmath71 ) ( the bottom - most dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : minimum](d ) ) .",
    "the internet point , @xmath72 , lies on this line .",
    "our numeric analysis shows that the internet value of @xmath72 is a unique value of @xmath1 minimizing the distance between the linear fit of ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath65 , which is the intersection of the linear fits of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , the internet distance distribution is the point that is _ closest _ to the msr apex , compared to distance distributions in all other scale - free graphs with power - law node degree distributions .",
    "of course , the tz scheme , reducing , in principle , the routing table size to about @xmath4 entries for @xmath5-node scale - free networks , and making routing decision running time constant , can not pretend to be a realistic internet interdomain routing scheme .",
    "first , it is static .",
    "second , addressing in interdomain routing is based on ip addresses rather than on interdomain graph node labels , that is , as numbers .",
    "third , it assumes availability of the global topology view .",
    "most importantly , in the context of our work , the scheme is not a stretch-1 scheme .",
    "indeed , interdomain routing in the internet is essentially shortest path routing .",
    "a routing scheme that would prevent a pair of ass from utilizing a peering link between them is not realistic , of course .",
    "thus , any stretch @xmath73 routing scheme applied to the internet would involve augmentation , in one form or another , of the routing information provided by the scheme with the shortest path routing information for non - shortest paths .",
    "this explains why we are concerned with the average stretch produced by a scheme .",
    "our principal finding that the average tz stretch on the internet graph is reasonably low opens a well - defined path for the future work in the area of applying relevant theoretical results obtained for routing to realistic scale - free networks ( see the next section ) . if the average stretch of even the `` exceptional '' tz scheme turned out to be relatively high , the scheme would be inapplicable _ in principle _",
    "( not just _ in practice _ ) , which would essentially close the above path , demonstrate impossibility to construct efficient and scalable routing for the internet , and call for searching one somewhere beyond the traditional graph - theoretical approach .    as we mention in the introduction , our finding that the internet distance distribution is in a close neighborhood of the msr apex can not be explained in the present idea set since the internet , as we know it today , has nothing to do with stretch .",
    "while we lack sufficient information to show cause for this effect , we do believe it strongly suggests the analytical structure of the average stretch function may be an indirect ( or even direct ) indicator of some yet - to - be discovered processes that have influenced the internet s topological evolution . in other words ,",
    "a rigorous explanation of this phenomenon would probably require much deeper understanding of the internet evolution principles ( that are far from being even known if we accept the critique of the ba model and alike ) and demonstration of a link between them and the tz scheme .",
    "we believe that an explanation of this effect will most probably have the following pattern .",
    "the internet evolution principles turn out to be such that they minimize @xmath74 , where @xmath74 is some known or yet unknown characteristic of a network . at the same time , the distance to the msr apex turns out to be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath74",
    ". there are reasons to believe that the distance to the apex is not something random .",
    "indeed , as we have seen , the apex is a _ unique",
    "_ critical point of the average tz stretch function , and , at the same time , the tz scheme is also `` exceptional '' in a sense that it delivers a nearly optimal first possibility to deviate from incompressible shortest path routing .",
    "the outlined pattern would create a necessary link between the two seemingly disjoint domains .",
    "the list of immediate practical next questions that remain open include :    * what is the average stretch produced by the _",
    "scheme on scale - free graphs ?",
    "+ obtaining analytical results for the cowen scheme is a harder problem .",
    "however , one can expect that the average stretch would be lower .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that making high - betweenness nodes belong to the ls should decrease the average stretch .",
    "the cowen ls construction algorithm uses the greedy set cover algorithm by lovsz preferring high degree nodes , @xcite , but as observed in @xcite , betweenness is linearly correlated with node degrees in the internet .",
    "the expectation of the cowen scheme producing an average stretch that is lower than in the tz case is in a good agreement with the general stretch - space trade - off since the cowen scheme has a higher local memory space upper bound . *",
    "do any routing schemes based on the _ additive _ stretch factor deliver lower average stretch on scale - free graphs ?",
    "+ the multiplicative stretch factor may be too coarse for short distances that prevail in scale - free graphs .",
    "* what is the memory space lower bound for _ shortest path",
    "_ routing on scale - free graphs ?",
    "+ we know that generic shortest path routing is incompressible . however , the situation is better for almost all graphs .",
    "we do not know any bounds for scale - free graphs . answering this question has very important practical implications since ( policy - constrained ) shortest path routing seems to be a requirement for internet interdomain routing .",
    "* more specifically , can any upper bounds be obtained for the total number of stretch @xmath73 paths produced by existing @xmath73 routing schemes on scale - free graphs ? + if these upper bounds are found to be as low as the total space upper bounds , then the original routing information can be augmented with the @xmath75 information for @xmath73 paths without increasing the space upper bounds . *",
    "what bounds can be obtained for _ dynamic _ routing on scale - free graphs ?",
    "+ of course , no realistic internet routing can neglect the adaptation cost considerations .",
    "while of critical practical importance , obtaining various bounds for dynamic routing on scale - free graphs seems to be the hardest problem among those we list here .",
    "furthermore , one can hardly expect such bounds to be low , taking into consideration rather pessimistic lower bounds obtained for dynamic routing on generic networks ( cf .  section  [ sec : routing ] ) .",
    "in addition , it is clear that the tz scheme can not be easily modified to perform well in the dynamic case since the scheme labels nodes with topology - sensitive information . in other words ,",
    "the scheme is not name - independent .",
    "as soon as topology changes , nodes need to be relabelled .",
    "significant progress in construction of name - independent static low - stretch routing schemes has been recently made by arias , cowen , et al .  in  @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side , which may turn out to have practical implications as well , the explanation of internet distance distribution proximity to the msr apex appears to be a very interesting problem",
    ". it would be much easier to solve , of course , if the integral in  ( [ stretch - superlong ] ) could be evaluated analytically .",
    "what might be an alternative set of assumptions that would make an expression analogous to  ( [ stretch - superlong ] ) analytically solvable ? can similar results be obtained for other forms of distance distributions , and , yet more importantly , for other routing schemes ( the cowen scheme , or the stretch-5 routing scheme with the @xmath76 local memory space upper bound obtained in @xcite , for example ) ?",
    "a technical issue with _ experimental _ ( vs.  analytical ) studies of the msr",
    "is that we do not know an efficient algorithm to generate graphs with a given distance distribution .    in any case , the explanation of internet s proximity to the apex is of great theoretical interest , as the fundamental laws governing the internet evolution remain unclear .",
    "therefore , on the practical side , a proper explanation of this effect may help us , for example , in out intent to move , @xcite , from purely _ descriptive _ internet evolution models to more _ explanatory _ ones , in the terminology of the program outlined by the authors of  @xcite .",
    "the internet started as a small research network designed and fully controlled by a group of few enthusiasts  ( @xcite ) .",
    "today , after a series of `` phase transitions , '' it has evolved to a huge network interconnecting tens of thousands of independent and even adversarial networks without a single point of external control .",
    "this makes the internet a `` self - governing , '' `` self - evolving '' complex system , a research subject of areas of physics ( statistical mechanics , in particular ) studying evolution of such systems in general .",
    "construction of realistic , efficient , and scalable routing for this `` new '' internet is an interesting and challenging task lying ahead of us .",

    "in this appendix , we calculate a rough estimate of the stretch factor of the kleinrock - kamoun ( kk ) hierarchical routing scheme , @xcite , applied to the observed internet interdomain topology .",
    "we find that the stretch is very high , which is consistent with the observation made in @xcite that the approach used there works reasonably well only for sparsely connected networks .",
    "the scale - free networks , on the contrary , are extremely densely connected .",
    "recall that @xcite assumes existence of a hierarchical partitioning of a network of size @xmath10 into @xmath81 levels of clusters .",
    "each @xmath82-level cluster consists of @xmath83 @xmath84-level clusters , @xmath85 , @xmath86-level clusters being nodes .",
    "the optimal clustering is achieved when @xmath87 .",
    "there are few other fairly strong assumptions about the properties of required partitioning .",
    "neither algorithm for its construction nor proof of its existence are delivered , but if it does exist then the stretch factor is shown to be @xmath88d_k,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the network average distance and @xmath89 is the diameter of a @xmath82-level cluster .",
    "it is further assumed in @xcite that both the network diameter and average distance are power - law functions of the network size .",
    "this is certainly not true for scale - free networks with power - law _ node degree _ distributions . for the very recent results on the average distance in such networks",
    "see the references mentioned in section [ sec : scale - free_networks ] . in the numerical evaluations in this appendix , we use the value of @xmath90 observed in the internet .",
    "much fewer results are available for the network diameter . however , in @xcite , it is shown that the diameter of networks with power - law node degree distribution with exponent @xmath1 lying between @xmath91 and @xmath26 scales almost surely as @xmath92 . for the internet , @xmath2 , and since the internet size @xmath93 is relatively large , we may write the internet diameter @xmath94 as @xmath95 with some multiplicative coefficient @xmath96 . the observed value of @xmath94 , @xmath97 ( @xcite ) , defines @xmath96 then .",
    "the size of a @xmath82-level cluster is obviously @xmath98 but nothing rigorous can be said about its degree distribution since there is no procedure for its construction .",
    "thus , it is natural to assume that its degree distribution is also power - law with @xmath99 , which gives an estimate of the @xmath82-level cluster diameter as @xmath100 .",
    "substituting this in ( [ kk_stretch : input ] ) and performing summation gives @xmath101 .\\ ] ] using the numerical values for @xmath10 , @xmath6 , @xmath94 , and optimal @xmath102 , we can see that the kk stretch factor on the internet interdomain topology is @xmath103 note that a 15-time path length increase in the internet would lead to as path lengths of @xmath104 and ip hop path lengths of @xmath105 .",
    "stretch factors for smaller , non - optimal values of @xmath81 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kk_stretch ] .",
    "the fact that the stretch grows almost linearly with the number of hierarchical levels follows directly from ( [ kk_stretch : exact_output ] ) , which , for large @xmath10 , can be rewritten as @xmath106 using @xmath107 , @xmath108 ( @xcite ) , and optimal @xmath87 , we obtain the following estimate of the stretch factor as a function of the network size : @xmath109",
    "in this appendix , we prove various statements made in section [ sec : analytical_results ] .",
    "a rigorous proof would involve the same type of argument as used to show that the hypergeometric distribution converges to the binomial distribution for small selections from large sets .",
    "we provide a close outline of the proof .",
    "suppose we have a set of @xmath10 objects of two types : @xmath110 objects of type 1 and @xmath111 objects of type 2 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "recall that the hypergeometric distribution , @xmath114 gives the probability that a random sample of @xmath81 objects from the set of all objects contains @xmath115 objects of type 1 .",
    "if sampling is with replacement  that is , as soon as one object is selected , it is immediately returned back to the set before the next object is selected , then the probability that @xmath115 type-1 objects have been selected after @xmath81 one - object selections is given by the binomial distribution , @xmath116 one can easily see that probabilities for small selections with and without replacement converge in the limit of large @xmath10 , @xmath117 { } p_b(x).\\ ] ]    suppose now that @xmath43 and @xmath118 are distance p.d.f .  and c.d.f .  of some graph of size @xmath10 , diameter @xmath94 , and that the graph ls @xmath119 is of size @xmath120 .",
    "the problem of finding the probability @xmath121 that the @xmath122th closest landmark is at distance @xmath13 is equivalent to the following object selection problem .",
    "the total number of objects to select from is @xmath10 , the number of types of objects is @xmath94 , and the number of objects of type @xmath13 , @xmath123 , is @xmath124 .",
    "in addition , @xmath120 random objects are marked as landmarks .",
    "since landmarks are randomly marked , @xmath121 is the probability that a randomly selected object is of type @xmath13 , which is @xmath43 by definition , times the probability that @xmath125 random objects are of ( possibly different ) types @xmath126 ( corresponding to the closer landmarks ) , times the probability that @xmath127 random objects are of ( possibly different ) types @xmath128 ( corresponding to the farther landmarks ) . that is , denoting the latter two probabilities by @xmath129 and @xmath130 respectively ,",
    "we can write that @xmath131 with some normalization coefficient @xmath132 .    the probability than one random object is of type @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) is @xmath118 ( @xmath135 ) by definition , but obtaining the exact answer for @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) involves some combinatorics resulting in a generalization of the hypergeometric distribution ( [ hypergeometric ] ) , which is left as an exercise for a rigorous reader .",
    "however , since @xmath136{}0 $ ] , sampling without replacement can be approximated by sampling with replacement , cf .",
    "( [ hyper - to - binom ] ) , which leads to the following approximations for @xmath129 and @xmath130 : @xmath137 the analogy to the order statistics becomes straightforward now .",
    "the normalization coefficient  @xmath132 in  ( [ gip - p+ ] ) is defined by the normalization condition @xmath138 which can be expressed as the following lebesgue - stieltjes integral : @xmath139 in the continuous limit , evaluation of the corresponding riemann integral gives @xmath140^{-1}.\\ ] ]      if we denote by @xmath141 the c.c.d.f .  for the distance to the closest landmark , @xmath142 then according to the cluster definition ( [ cluster_def ] ) , the average cluster size is @xmath143    using the explicit expression for  @xmath144 in  ( [ gi ] ) , we can calculate an upper bound for  @xmath145 by representing the sum in  ( [ g1-sum ] ) as the following lebesgue - stieltjes integral : @xmath146 evaluation of the corresponding riemann integral gives @xmath147 where equality is attained in the continuous limit .",
    "note that the obtained upper bound , @xmath148 , is equivalent to the c.c.d.f.for the geometric distribution , @xmath149 , with the success probability @xmath150 and number of trials @xmath151 .",
    "the reason for that becomes transparent after formulating the problem in the object selection framework considered in appendix [ sec : proofs : gi ] .    substituting ( [ g1-final ] ) in ( [ average - c - sum ] ) completes the proof : @xmath152    note that clusters are originally defined as objects `` inverse '' to balls .",
    "they are `` inverse '' in the following sense : . if we denote the c.d.f .",
    "of @xmath153 by @xmath154 , then the average ball size is @xmath155 since ( [ average - c - sum ] ) can be written as @xmath156 the known fact that the average ball and cluster sizes are equal is just a consequence of integration by parts of the following lebesgue - stieltjes integral : @xmath157      note that the first case in ( [ stretchval - shortcut ] ) , @xmath158 , accounts exactly for stretch-1 paths from @xmath159 to destinations @xmath160 , ( see definition ( [ cluster_def ] ) ) .",
    "the second case , @xmath161 , accounts for the degenerate shortcut on paths from @xmath159 to @xmath162 that go through @xmath163 . on such paths , @xmath164 ,",
    "the length of the shortcut portion of the total path from @xmath159 to @xmath163 is zero , and the stretch is 1 .",
    "it is easy to see that , on small - world graphs , paths from @xmath159 to @xmath162 that do not go through @xmath163 but that still have shortcuts are rare and hard to account for without knowing the graph topology .",
    "indeed , consider triangle @xmath165 in fig.[fig : shortcut - triangle ] , where @xmath166 represents source node @xmath159 , @xmath167 is destination @xmath163 , and @xmath119 is @xmath162 .",
    "shortcutting occurs when destination @xmath167 is `` in front of '' its landmark @xmath119 , which is represented by placing @xmath167 to the left of the vertical line .",
    "it is clear that on small - world graphs , characterized by low average distances and narrow distance distributions , the possibility for @xmath167 to _ not _ lie on path @xmath168 is minuscule .    to see this ,",
    "suppose we still want to account for cases when @xmath167 does not belong to @xmath168 by approximating such cases within the @xmath91-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the shortcut path is then @xmath169 in fig .",
    "[ fig : shortcut - triangle ] , with @xmath170 representing the first node @xmath171 on the path from @xmath159 to @xmath162 such that @xmath172 .",
    "its position on @xmath168 is defined by @xmath173 , and the length of segment @xmath174 is denoted by @xmath175 . the stretch is then given by @xmath176 , and solving @xmath177 , we find that @xmath178 .",
    "our numerical experiments show that it does not matter if , with condition @xmath161 , we use @xmath179 or @xmath180 : the two stretch distributions are virtually identical and the average stretch difference is only in the fourth digit .",
    "this means that @xmath181 is virtually always @xmath182 as soon as @xmath161 . from @xmath183/z = 1 $ ]",
    "follows @xmath184 , which means that @xmath167 lies on @xmath168 .",
    "note , however , that condition @xmath161 is not the exact condition for the shortcut presence in the euclidean space . as mentioned above , the exact condition is that @xmath167 is to the left of the vertical line , which implies @xmath185 . in our experiments ,",
    "we observe that using this condition instead of @xmath161 leads to the stretch distribution drastically distinct from the one observed in simulations .",
    "this is because any estimates based on approximation of the finite metric space in a graph by the euclidean metric space are not applicable to small - world graphs . such estimates are more applicable to grid - like graphs with wide distance distributions and average distances growing as power - law functions of the graph size .",
    "suppose the distance matrix @xmath186 is given .",
    "let us denote by @xmath187 the set of elements in @xmath186 equal to @xmath188 ( @xmath188-elements ) , @xmath189 note that the distance p.d.f",

    "the distribution of distances between them is also the distribution of values of elements in a @xmath195 submatrix @xmath196 obtained from @xmath186 by intersecting the @xmath197 rows and columns . since the selection is random , this distribution is also @xmath198 .",
    "if _ two _ groups of random nodes , @xmath199 and @xmath200 , are selected and we are looking for the distribution of distances between pairs of nodes belonging to the _ different _ groups , we construct a set @xmath201 by intersecting the @xmath199 rows of @xmath186 with the @xmath200 columns and _ vice versa_. this subset of @xmath186 is no longer a submatrix of @xmath186 , but the distribution of @xmath188-elements in it is still @xmath198 .",
    "our problem is to find the conditional distribution @xmath202 for distance @xmath203 between a group of @xmath204 ( on average ) random nodes at distance @xmath115 from some random node ( the landmark closest to the destination ) and another group of @xmath205 ( on average ) nodes at distance @xmath206 from the same node .",
    "the groups may overlap when @xmath207 .",
    "they define the subset @xmath208 as in the previous paragraph .",
    "the distribution we are looking for , @xmath202 , is the distribution of values of elements in this subset .",
    "since there are no correlations in the distance matrix , the only difference between this subset and truly random subsets @xmath209 from the previous paragraph is due to the triangle inequality caused by the fact that the two groups of nodes are neighbors of the same node .",
    "this means that @xmath210 is also a subset of @xmath211 defined in ( [ dabc - def ] ) , and , since @xmath210 is random in other respects , the distribution of values of its elements is the same as in @xmath211 .",
    "in other words , @xmath212 in ( [ dabc - distrib ] ) .    noticing that , by the formula for the conditional probability , @xmath213 completes the proof .",
    "in this appendix we demonstrate that linearity of functions @xmath214 in the msr follows from the gaussian form of the distance distribution .",
    "we consider the continuous case , for which @xmath35 is given by ( [ stretch - superlong ] ) .",
    "the necessary condition for a local minimum of @xmath33 in the @xmath6- or @xmath7-direction is @xmath215 or @xmath216 respectively .",
    "after some algebra using @xmath217 , we obtain , with @xmath115 , @xmath206 , and @xmath203 having the same semantics as in section  [ sec : analytical_results ] , @xmath218 these can be significantly simplified by approximating variables @xmath115 , @xmath206 , and @xmath203 by their means ( the `` mean field '' approximation ) : @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 .",
    "note that @xmath222 and @xmath223 where @xmath224 is , in fact , a function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath225 , we can reduce ( [ ds - dd - long ] ) and ( [ ds - ds - long ] ) to , respectively , @xmath226      the direct solution of ( [ ds - ds - medium ] ) would involve resolving function @xmath231 first . however , a simpler way is to use an asymptotic form of the error function in the last term of ( [ ds - ds - medium ] ) , @xmath232 which is valid for sufficiently large @xmath7 , @xmath233 .",

    "[ fig : minimum](d ) ) , @xmath244 .",
    "the match between @xmath245 and the data fit , @xmath246 , is worse , which suggests that the source of error is mostly in ( [ erf - asympt ] ) .",
    "we do not obtain non - zero values for the additive coefficients , @xmath247 , in @xmath248 that define the apex location .",
    "thus , we conclude that a more accurate analysis of the essentially discrete case with small @xmath7 is required to analytically obtain the apex location .    note , however , that equations ( [ ds - dd - short ] ) and ( [ ds - ds - medium ] ) are consistent with the observed analytical structure of @xmath35 even for small @xmath7 . indeed",
    ", the solutions of the _ system _ of equations ( [ ds - dd - short ] ) and ( [ ds - ds - medium ] ) ( corresponding to the true stationary points of @xmath33 , @xmath249 ) exist only for @xmath250 , when the last term of ( [ ds - ds - medium ] ) goes away .",
    "then we have from ( [ xi - def ] ) with @xmath251 that @xmath252 as expected , and _ any _ @xmath6 delivers a solution .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : minimum ] , the actual average distance can be only an integer @xmath82 or @xmath253 when @xmath250 .",
    "thus , the flat - topped peaks and narrow cracks we observe in fig .  [ fig : minimum](c ) at @xmath54 are consistent with @xmath249 there .    since @xmath254 only when @xmath250 , we have also effectively demonstrated , at least with the approximations we have made to obtain ( [ ds - dd - short ] ) and ( [ ds - ds - medium ] ) , that the apex _ can not _ be a _ true _ stationary point of @xmath33 .",
    "the ls size @xmath120 is a function of @xmath10 , and , hence , solutions @xmath255 are also functions of the graph size .",
    "they are shown in fig .",

    "we see that @xmath256 .",
    "this sheds some light on the analytical structure of @xmath33 as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "we can see , for example , that as the network grows , the msr becomes narrower and closer to @xmath54 .",
    "since for scale - free nets , @xmath7 does approach @xmath86 as @xmath257 ( @xcite ) , we conclude that , independent of their size , the scale - free graphs are characterized by the lowest possible average stretch values ."
