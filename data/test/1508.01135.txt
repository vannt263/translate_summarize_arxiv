    "azobenzene - functionalized self - assembled monolayers ( sams ) on metal surfaces represent a viable and efficient way to obtain ordered architectures of photo - switching molecules .",

    "@xcite in order to overcome these limitations and obtain sams with efficient switching rates , a number of strategies have been developed , such as modifying the morphology of the substrate , @xcite introducing organic spacers , @xcite and functionalizing azobenzene with end groups.@xcite        to tune these complex systems in view of optimized performance , a deep knowledge of their chemical composition and structure - property relationship is required .",
    "x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) represents a powerful technique for this purpose , and a synergistic interplay with theory can provide an insightful interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "first - principles methods represent the most suitable tool . density - functional theory ( dft ) , both in the _ core - hole _ approximation @xcite and the @xmath1-self - consistent - field ( @xmath1scf ) approach , @xcite is routinely applied to simulate xas in a wide range of materials , from gas - phase molecules to solid - state systems .",

    "we consider excitations from the nitrogen ( n ) @xmath0 edge , i.e. , involving transitions from 1@xmath2 electrons to the conduction bands . in this manner , we obtain exciton binding energies and determine the character of the core - level excitations .",
    "going from the isolated molecule to a closely - packed sam , we analyze the xas at increasing density of azobenzene molecules , and we compare our results with experimental data . in order to understand whether and how functional groups affect the nature of the excitons and their binding energy , we consider molecules that are either h - terminated ( h - az ) or functionalized with trifluoromethyl ( -az ) .",
