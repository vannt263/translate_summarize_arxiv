    "the surface states of three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators ( tis ) @xcite possess a helical spin texture in which the spin and momentum are perpendicularly locked to each other . due to this spin - momentum locking",
    ", a net spin polarization can be induced by a charge current and _",
    "vice versa_. this peculiar property makes 3d tis a promising platform for spintronic applications @xcite , and as a result , there is growing interest in topological spintronics .",
    "already a number of experiments with various approaches have been carried out on 3d tis @xcite , including spin - transfer torque @xcite , spin pumping @xcite , and all - electrical measurement @xcite . among these experiments ,",
    "the all - electrical measurement of the charge - current - induced spin polarization is of particular importance due to its direct applicability to spintronics .    for spintronic applications ,",
    "it is important to be able to perform  spin - transistor \" operation , that is , to switch the orientation of the charge - current - induced spin polarization via electrostatic gating . in this regard",
    ", the switching of the spin helicity across the dirac point in the topological surface state ( tss ) of a 3d ti may seem promising at first sight , but this expectation is in fact ungrounded , because the fermi velocity of electrons with a given spin orientation does not change across the dirac point ( detailed explanations of this point is given later ) . nevertheless , in the literature",
    "two different types of current - induced spin polarizations have been observed .",
    "so far both types of results have been claimed to be due to the tss , leaving the situation controversial .",
    "if this controversy is sorted out and the origin of the two types of current - induced spin polarizations is understood , such an understanding may make it possible to conceive a spin transistor based on 3d tis . here",
    ", we directly address this problem and offer a possible solution .",
    "the electrical detection of the current - induced spin polarization has been reported in various 3d ti materials , including bi@xmath0se@xmath1 @xcite , bi@xmath2sb@xmath3te@xmath4se@xmath5 @xcite , ( bi@xmath6sb@xmath7)@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite , and bi@xmath0te@xmath0se @xcite .",
    "most experiments use a ferromagnetic contact as a spin detector and measure spin - dependent voltage between the ferromagnet ( fm ) and ti .",
    "however , conflicting interpretations of the spin voltage @xmath8 have been claimed in the literature .",
    "specifically , li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite attributed positive @xmath8 to the situation when the magnetization of the fm detector @xmath9 is antiparallel to the induced spin polarization @xmath10 ( i.e. @xmath11 ) , whereas most other papers @xcite attribute positive @xmath8 to the situation @xmath12 .",
    "theoretically @xcite , @xmath8 should be positive for @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , as long as the tss is responsible for the induced @xmath10 , the orientation of @xmath10 is expected to be the same for both @xmath14-type and @xmath15-type carriers @xcite .",
    "indeed , the expected polarity was observed in a recent experiment in which the carrier type of a ti device was continuously changed from @xmath14-type to @xmath15-type by backgating @xcite .",
    "hence , the contribution of the tss to the spin voltage has become largely understood , but the reason of the controversial observation by li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite remains a puzzle . in this respect , it is useful to notice that the possible contribution of the topologically - trivial two - dimensional ( 2d ) states with a large rashba spin splitting , which is caused by surface band bending and often coexist with the tss @xcite , has not been well understood .",
    "such rashba states could lead to an opposite sign of the current - induced spin polarization @xcite .",
    "one should note that any difference in the work functions between fm and ti would lead to a band bending at the interface and could cause a pronounced effect in spin detection , but this possibility has been neglected in previous works @xcite .    in this paper , we report the current - induced spin polarization in devices made from the topological insulator bisbtese@xmath0 . in the as - grown crystals of this material ,",
    "the chemical potential lies slightly below the dirac point of the surface state , and its position changes easily when the sample is annealed ; this makes it possible for us to investigate spin - voltage devices with different carrier types and densities . in sec .",
    "ii , we will present a transparent review of the physics behind the spin - dependent voltage in the ti - based devices and discuss the correct sign of the current - induced spin polarization generated in the tss .",
    "we will then present our experiment , in which two different types of spin polarization were detected .",
    "the first type was observed in a strongly @xmath14-type doped bisbtese@xmath0 device and its polarity meets the expectation for the tss .",
    "the second type was observed in two low - carrier - density devices and their spin polarization can not be ascribed to the tss .",
    "we propose that the latter originates from the topologically - trivial 2d states with rashba spin splitting , and discuss why they are expected in low - carrier - density samples .",
    "the possibility to utilize the rashba - split 2d states alongside the tss opens new pathways in future topological spintronic devices , in particular the prospect for spin - transistor operations .",
    "it has been established that the non - equilibrium spin polarization can be detected by using a fm contact as a spin detector .",
    "early theories and experiments of spin detection started from the 1980s @xcite . at that time",
    ", ohmic contacts between fm and a normal metal were employed for spin detection . however , it eventually turned out that ohmic contacts are not efficient for detecting the spin polarization occurring in semiconductors due to the so - called conductance mismatch @xcite : when the impedances of the fm and the material beneath it are significantly different , the spin - dependent voltage becomes too small to be measured . in 2000",
    ", it was theoretically proposed that the problem of conductance mismatch can be solved by inserting a tunnel barrier between the fm detector and the semiconductor @xcite .",
    "corresponding experimental techniques were developed several years later @xcite and they are recently applied to detect the current - induced spin polarization in tis @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , there is a controversy over the sign of the spin - dependent voltage in the previous studies on tis @xcite .",
    "this controversy comes down to the question ,  what is the proper sign of @xmath8 for @xmath12 ? \" here @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the spin - dependent voltage and the magnetization in the fm spin detector , and @xmath10 is the non - equilibrium spin polarization to be detected . in the first paper by li _",
    "@xcite , it was argued that _ negative _ @xmath16 corresponds to @xmath12 , whereas in the other papers @xcite , the opposite was claimed to be true , that is , _ positive _ @xmath16 corresponds to @xmath17 . in the following , we review the basic principles of spin detection in the case of tis and explain from the ground up why the latter is correct",
    "this clarification forms the basis of our interpretation of the two different types of @xmath8 signals observed in bisbtese@xmath0    the principle of spin detection is illustrated in fig .",
    "the key idea is that , due to the electron exchange between the fm and the semiconductor , the fm always equilibrate with the electrochemical potential of the subband which has the same magnetization direction . to be concrete , we consider the basic configuration shown in fig .",
    "a fm contact with a tunnel barrier , which works as a spin detector , is placed on top of a semiconductor ( sm ) . for simplicity , we assume that the fm is a half - metal , namely , only one subband is at the fermi level . the voltage @xmath8 is measured on the fm with respect to the sm .",
    "hereafter , we sometimes use @xmath18 and @xmath19 to denote the @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions , respectively .",
    "it is important to notice that , due to the negative charge , the electron magnetic moment @xmath22 is _ antiparallel _ to the spin vector @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the @xmath25-factor and @xmath26 is the bohr magneton .",
    "this means that the @xmath27 subband corresponds to the @xmath28 subband , and the @xmath29 subband corresponds to the @xmath30 subband .",
    "note that all the arrows in the band diagrams in fig .",
    "1 denote the direction of the _ magnetization _ , which is opposite to the direction of spin polarization .    in the absence of spin polarization in the sm , the electrochemical potentials of @xmath27 and @xmath29 subbands are equal .",
    "the chemical potential of the ferromagnet is also at the same level , irrespective of its magnetization direction . in this case ,",
    "the fm is electrically neutral and hence @xmath31 , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) .    when a non - equilibrium spin polarization @xmath10 is induced in the sm via methods like spin injection @xcite , a corresponding magnetization @xmath32 is generated in the @xmath33 direction .",
    "the non - zero @xmath32 leads to an increase ( decrease ) in the electrochemical potential of the majority ( minority ) subband , with the potential difference @xmath34 ( `` maj '' and `` min '' stand for majority and minority , respectively ) .",
    "when @xmath35 , electrons in the majority subband of the sm will move into the fm and raise its potential @xmath36 , until @xmath37 is reached . in this process ,",
    "the fm become negatively charged , giving rise to a negative voltage @xmath38 . on the other hand , when @xmath39 , electrons in the fm will move into the minority band of the sm and lower @xmath36 , until @xmath40 is reached . in this case , the ferromagnet is positively charged , leading to a positive voltage @xmath41 .",
    "all possible combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath9 , as well as the resulting @xmath8 , are illustrated in figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) .",
    "these considerations lead to the following conclusion : @xmath42 this conclusion supports the arguments in refs .",
    "it also means that the spin voltage observed in ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to the spin polarization that is opposite to what the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite thought to be there .",
    "the tss of 3d tis possesses a helical spin texture illustrated in fig .",
    "2(a ) ; here , the spin vector @xmath23 points to @xmath43 with @xmath44 the normal vector of the surface and @xmath45 the group velocity of the bloch electron with momentum @xmath46 .",
    "the net spin polarization per unit area , @xmath10 , can be written as @xmath47 where all the occupied states in the surface brillouin zone ( bz ) contribute to the integral .    in the absence of charge",
    "current , the center of the fermi circle is located at @xmath48 [ solid circle in fig .",
    "2(b ) ] and the integral in eq .",
    "( 2 ) becomes zero due to symmetry .",
    "when the tss carries a charge current @xmath49 along the @xmath50 direction , the fermi circle shifts in the @xmath51 direction by @xmath52 [ dashed circle in fig .",
    "2(b ) ] . in this case",
    ", the fermi circle is no longer symmetric with respect to @xmath53 and eq .",
    "( 2 ) gives a finite @xmath10 in the @xmath54 direction .",
    "based on this picture , we now discuss the current - induced spin polarization in @xmath14-type and @xmath15-type regions of the dirac cone .",
    "the longitudinal section cut of the dirac cone along @xmath55 , shown in figs .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) , makes it easy to understand the situation .",
    "the spin direction of the green branch is @xmath56 and that of the blue branch is @xmath57 .",
    "an electric field @xmath58 in the @xmath59 direction drives a charge current @xmath49 along the @xmath59 direction and shifts the fermi surface in the @xmath60 direction , as illustrated in figs .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) for the @xmath14- and @xmath15-type regions .",
    "notice that the shift of the fermi surface always makes the green branch ( @xmath61 ) more populated , no matter if the fermi level is above or below the dirac point ; this is because the electrons on the green branch are always accelerated by @xmath62 , since their fermi velocity is along @xmath60 . on the contrary , electrons on the blue branch",
    "are always decelerated by @xmath62 . the larger population in the @xmath56 branch gives an induced @xmath10 in the @xmath54 direction .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath10 originating from the tss , the polarity is always along @xmath63 irrespective of the carrier type . at first glance , this conclusion may look counter - intuitive , because the spin helicity reverses when the fermi level crosses the dirac point .",
    "however , for a fixed @xmath46 , the group velocity @xmath45 also changes sign across the dirac point .",
    "this means that the sign change in @xmath45 counteracts the spin - helicity reversal and leave the orientation of @xmath10 unchanged .",
    "the above discussion implies that the tss of 3d tis can only account for the current - induced @xmath10 directed to @xmath64 .",
    "if the detected @xmath10 is along the @xmath65 direction , one must consider a different origin .",
    "bisbtese@xmath0 is a bulk - insulating ti with the fermi level located slightly below the dirac point @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the current - induced spin polarization in various devices based on exfoliated flakes of bisbtese@xmath0 .",
    "the results presented in this paper were obtained in three typical devices , labeled # 1 , # 2 and # 3 .    high quality bisbtese@xmath0 single crystals were grown by a modified bridgman method .",
    "thin bisbtese@xmath0 flakes were exfoliated from single crystals and transferred onto si / sio@xmath66 substrates .",
    "the flakes were examined under a laser confocal microscope .",
    "those with uniform thickness and flat surfaces were selected for device fabrications .",
    "the thicknesses of the flakes used in devices # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 were 172 , 82 , and 54 nm , respectively .",
    "after the exfoliation , an al@xmath66o@xmath67 or mgo tunnel barrier was deposited on top of the flakes .",
    "devices # 1 and # 2 had the al@xmath66o@xmath67 barrier , which was fabricated by first evaporating 0.7-nm - thick al in a thermal evaporator and then _ in - situ _ oxidizing the al layer with pure oxygen .",
    "the mgo barrier was used in device # 3 , for which about 2-nm - thick mgo was directly deposited from a mgo source by electron - beam ( eb ) evaporation .",
    "the tunnel barrier proved to be very important for the spin detection .",
    "no spin signal was observed in devices with too thin or too thick a tunnel barrier .",
    "the fm and normal - metal contacts were fabricated in two subsequent eb lithography steps .",
    "the fm electrodes are made of 30-nm - thick ni@xmath68fe@xmath69 ( py ) capped with about 160-nm - thick au .",
    "the au layer prevents py from oxidation and ensures a reliable electrical connection over the edges of the flakes .",
    "the normal - metal electrodes are made of ti / au , with the thicknesses of ti and au layers being 3 and 190 nm , respectively . before the deposition of the ti / au electrodes ,",
    "the tunnel barrier in the contact area defined by eb lithography had been removed by shortly dipping the substrate into a diluted tetramethyl - ammonium hydroxide solution .",
    "the device concept is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , and the optical photographs of the devices are shown in figs .",
    "4(a)-4(c ) .",
    "as - grown bisbtese@xmath0 crystals are @xmath15-type , with the bulk carrier density down to @xmath70 @xmath71 @xcite . according to our experience ,",
    "if high - temperature baking is avoided during the lithography process , the carrier density in bisbtese@xmath0 flakes can be kept low even after they are fabricated into nano - devices ; on the other hand , once the flakes are baked at @xmath72 150@xmath73c for several minutes , they will be strongly @xmath14-type doped and the fermi level will move into the bulk conduction band .",
    "based on this knowledge , we have managed to obtain bisbtese@xmath0 devices with various carrier types and concentrations .",
    "for example , during the device fabrication process , device # 1 was baked at @xmath74 = 170@xmath73c twice to cure the zep520a resist , each time for 3 minutes ; in contrast , for devices # 2 and # 3 , the curing of resist was done at @xmath74 = 110@xmath73c for 20 minutes , so that the flakes did not experience any high - temperature baking .",
    "the difference in baking temperature resulted in different carrier concentrations . to infer the carrier type and density , we measured the hall resistivity @xmath75 of all the devices at @xmath76 k , as plotted in figs .",
    "4(j)-4(l ) .",
    "device # 1 showed a linear @xmath77 behavior with a negative slope [ fig .",
    "4(j ) ] ; using the formula @xmath78 , we obtain the two - dimensional ( 2d ) carrier density @xmath79 @xmath80 .",
    "here , the negative sign means @xmath14-type carriers .",
    "the @xmath77 behavior of device # 2 was also linear , but it has a positive slope much larger in absolute value [ fig .",
    "4(k ) ] , indicating @xmath15-type carriers with much lower carrier density ; the linear fit gives @xmath81 @xmath80 .",
    "a highly nonlinear @xmath77 curve was obtained in device # 3 [ fig .",
    "4(l ) ] , indicating the coexistence of @xmath14-type and @xmath15-type channels . to obtain the carrier densities of both channels",
    ", we fit the @xmath77 curve to the expression given by the two - band model @xcite , @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 are the 2d carrier density and the mobility of the 1st and 2nd channels , respectively .",
    "those parameters are constrained by the sheet resistance in zero field which is expressed as @xmath87 the fitting gives @xmath88 @xmath80 , @xmath89 @xmath80 , @xmath84 = 275 @xmath90/vs and @xmath86 = 4068 @xmath90/vs .",
    "this result suggests that the top and bottom surfaces have different types of carriers , but they both have chemical potential located close to the dirac point .",
    "the detection of current - induced spin polarization was performed in a four - terminal configuration , as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "3 . a @xmath91 current @xmath49 flows along the @xmath92 direction between the outer ti / au contacts .",
    "in - plane magnetic field @xmath93 is applied in the @xmath20 direction , which is perpendicular to @xmath49 and parallel to the easy axis of the py spin detector , to control the magnetization @xmath94 in py . upon scanning @xmath95 from negative to positive ( and _ vice",
    "versa _ ) , the voltage @xmath96 between a py tunneling contact and a ti / au contact is measured as a function of @xmath95 . to reduce noise ,",
    "the data for each curve were averaged over tens of independent scans .",
    "the measured voltage can be written as @xmath97 , where @xmath8 is the spin - dependent voltage we are interested in , and @xmath98 is a trivial parabolic background mainly contributed by the magnetoresistance of bisbtese@xmath0 . when the py magnetization @xmath94 switches , @xmath8 suddenly changes sign , whereas @xmath98 does not . therefore , it is easy to separate @xmath8 from the measured @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath99 data of all the devices are plotted in figs .",
    "4(d)-4(i ) .",
    "curves measured in forward and backward @xmath95-scans form a hysteresis loop .",
    "the half width of the loop corresponds to the coercive field of the py spin detector , which is 10 , 20 , and 7 mt for devices # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 , respectively .",
    "the coercive field of a nanoscale ferromagnet depends on its shape , and narrower width gives higher coercive field .",
    "the width of the py electrodes in devices # 1 , # 2 and # 3 was 1 , 0.5 , and 1.5 @xmath100 , respectively , which is consistent with the observed difference in the coercive field .",
    "the amplitude of the spin - dependent voltage can be defined as @xmath101 . with this definition ,",
    "the sign of @xmath102 is determined by the direction of the jump in the @xmath99 loop , and hence implies the orientation of the detected @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , @xmath103 is obtained when @xmath104 shows up for @xmath105 ( i.e. @xmath106 ) , and this is the expected sign of @xmath102 for @xmath107 [ see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] and thus we can conclude @xmath108 .",
    "similarly , @xmath109 implies @xmath110 .",
    "hence , the following relation exists between @xmath102 and @xmath10 : @xmath111    in our experiment , @xmath99 loops were measured at both positive and negative currents for each device .",
    "the reversal in @xmath49 resulted in the sign change of @xmath102 , indicating that the orientation of @xmath10 is controlled by the direction of @xmath49 .",
    "this is consistent with the existence of a helical spin texture in the current - carrying states .",
    "however , as one can see in figs .",
    "4(d ) , 4(f ) , and 4(h ) , the orientation of the current - induced @xmath10 is apparently different between device # 1 and the others . to be specific ,",
    "our data imply @xmath108 for a positive @xmath112 in device # 1 , while it is the opposite in devices # 2 and # 3 .",
    "this means that the underlying spin polarization is @xmath113 in the former and @xmath114 in the latter .",
    "according to the discussion in sec .",
    "ii , only the former can be attributed to the tss of bisbtese@xmath0 .",
    "the main result of the present experiment is the reproducible observation of the opposite polarity , which points to the possibility of utilizing the reversed spin helicity in ti - based devices .    in passing , a linear dependence between @xmath102 and @xmath112",
    "was observed in the @xmath99 loops measured at various bias currents , as shown in fig . 5 for devices # 1 and # 3 .",
    "this linear dependence allows us to define a current - independent spin resistance @xmath115 . as an example",
    ", @xmath116 data for various @xmath112 values are shown in fig . 6 for device # 1 .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "iii , the @xmath99 signal in devices # 2 and # 3 can not be interpreted to be due to the tss of a 3d ti . here",
    ", we discuss its possible origins .",
    "one possibility is that the observed @xmath99 is not stemming from a spin polarization but due to some artifacts like local hall voltages .",
    "it was proposed that hall voltages can be locally induced by fringe fields of the fm electrodes and could give rise to a signal similar to the @xmath99 loop @xcite .",
    "however , one can rule out this possibility in our experiments for the following reasons . first , if the observed @xmath99 loops are caused by some trivial reasons like the local hall effect , the signal should be insensitive to the details of the tunnel barrier , and thus it should be observed in all devices with similar fm contacts . in this regard ,",
    "the hysteretic signals in our experiment are very sensitive to the quality and thickness of the tunnel barrier ; we have investigated more than a dozen devices , and the hysteretic voltages were only observed in those devices where the thickness of the tunnel barrier falls into a narrow window and the resulting contact resistance takes a suitable value ( 550 k@xmath117 ) .",
    "the voltage loops were never observed in devices with too thin or too thick a tunnel barriers .",
    "second , specifically for the local hall effect , since the direction of the unbalanced fringe field depends on both the local geometry of the fm electrode and the morphology of the ti sample @xcite , the polarities of the observed voltage loops should be _",
    "random_. therefore , the voltage loops observed at different fm contacts made on the same device could present opposite polarities .",
    "however , in our experiment the voltage loops measured in the same device consistently showed the same polarity at different fm contacts .",
    "as an example , the data measured on two different fm contacts in device # 3 are plotted in fig .",
    "5(b ) .    to conclusively rule out the possibility that the observed voltage loops were caused by some artifacts ( local hall effect in the ti ake , anomalous nernsteffect in the fm lead , adverse effects of side contacts , etc . )",
    ", we have performed a control experiment on a device which was fabricated in the same way as the other devices except that it does not have a tunnel barrier beneath the fm electrodes . as shown in the supplemental material ( fig .",
    "s2 ) @xcite , this control device yielded null result even with a high current of 200 @xmath118a . since all the spurious origins of the voltage loops so far discussed do not require a tunnel contact , the complete absence of a voltage hysteresis in our control device safely rules out the artifacts as the origin of the observed signal .",
    "given that the voltage signal is genuinely of spin polarization origin , the most likely origin of the opposite spin voltages observed in devices # 2 and # 3 is the electronic states which have an opposite spin helicity to that of the tss . to the best of our knowledge , the only known states with such a feature are the rashba - split 2d states caused by a surface band bending @xcite .",
    "when a downward band - bending occurs at the surface of a 3d ti and confines the bulk states in the potential well , the resulting 2d sub - bands present a rashba spin splitting and form two concentric fermi circles with opposite spin helicities @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "it has been elucidated that the helicity of the outer fermi circle is opposite to that of the tss @xcite , so the contribution of the rashba - spit states to the spin signal is also opposite .",
    "it is prudent to mention that the opposite spin voltages observed in devices # 2 and # 3 could be due to a _ negative _ spin detection efficiency of the fm contacts ; namely , it is possible that the minority spin has a larger density of states at @xmath119 compared to the majority spin in a ferromagnet , and in such a case the spin voltage is reversed from the case depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "also , a reversal in the spin voltage may happen if the tunnel barrier has a spin - selective nature .",
    "however , this possibility can be largely ruled out for following reasons : ( i ) for py / al@xmath0o@xmath1 contacts , it is known that the spin polarization of tunneling conductance ( sptc ) is positive ( i.e. the spin polarization of tunneling current is parallel to the majority spin in py ) @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the py / al@xmath0o@xmath1 contacts in devices # 1 and # 2 were made with essentially the same conditions , so it is unlikely that the sptc is reversed between the two .",
    "( iii ) by assuming a positive sptc , our results are consistent with the majority of existing experiments ( ref .",
    "14 - 19 ) , and can be naturally explained by the band - bending theory we discuss in detail later ; if we assume a negative sptc , the experimental results are not understandable .",
    "nevertheless , we can not completely exclude the remote possibility that the py / al@xmath0o@xmath1 contact in device # 2 and the py / mgo contact in device # 3 somehow had an unusual negative sptc due to unknown reasons ; if it were the case , the present conclusion would need reconsideration .",
    "in passing , very recently li and appelbaum @xcite reported an experiment in which they observed a similar voltage loop at a fm tunnel contact fabricated on a au film , and they claimed that such a result discredits the experiments on ti spin devices .",
    "however , since au films are known to exhibit a giant spin hall effect @xcite , when a charge current flows through a au film , an in - plane spin polarization is naturally generated on both top and bottom surfaces and detected by the fm tunnel contact .",
    "hence , their experiment seems to be a confirmation that au is not a simple metal but a spin - orbit active material .      to judge whether the rashba - split 2d states are indeed relevant to our devices # 2 and # 3 , it is important to understand the band alignment at the py - ti interface and the work functions of py and bisbtese@xmath0 .",
    "the work function of ni@xmath68fe@xmath69 permalloy is known to be @xmath120 = 4.83",
    "ev @xcite , which means that the chemical potential of py lies 4.83 ev below the vacuum level .",
    "the work function of our as - grown bisbtese@xmath0 crystals was measured by photoemission to be @xmath121 = 5.20 ev @xcite ; since the dirac point of the tss in as - grown bisbtese@xmath0 is located very close to the chemical potential @xcite , one can see that the dirac point lies @xmath1225.20 ev below the vacuum level .",
    "therefore , the band alignment of the py - bisbtese@xmath0 interface is such that the dirac point of the ti side always comes @xmath1220.37 ev below the chemical potential of the metallic py side .",
    "if the chemical potential of the bisbtese@xmath0 flake used in the device is unchanged from the as - grown state , there occurs a charge accumulation in bisbtese@xmath0 near the interface to compensate for the @xmath1220.37 ev difference in the chemical potential when the two materials are joined , and this is the basic mechanism of the band bending [ compare figs .",
    "8(c ) and 8(d ) ] .",
    "however , when the chemical potential in bisbtese@xmath0 is shifted during the device fabrication process , @xmath121 will change and the strength of the band bending will be different , although the band alignment at the interface is always fixed [ compare figs .",
    "8(b ) and 8(d ) ] .",
    "note that the existence of a tunnel barrier does _ not _ affect the band bending , as long as the barrier is thin enough to allow electrons to flow until the electrochemical potentials of the two sides ( ti and py ) equilibrate .",
    "the above argument for the band bending may not hold when there are a high density of defect states at the interface , because they would pin the chemical potential ; however , our previous top - gating experiments have shown that a thin layer of al@xmath0o@xmath1 deposited on a ti surface does not introduce any noticeable defect states at the interface if the deposition is done at temperatures less than 100@xmath73c @xcite .",
    "in fact , since the ( 111 ) surface of tetradymite ti materials does not have dangling bonds , a high density of defect states are not expected at the interface .",
    "we emphasize that the fermi level of the ti surface beneath the metallic fm electrode is always fixed and will not change with the chemical potential in the ti sample , as long as the electron exchange is allowed through the tunnel barrier .",
    "this means that one can not control the fermi level of the portions of the tss at which the current - induced spin polarization is detected by the fm detector , even if the fermi level of the rest of the tss can be controlled by electrostatic gating .",
    "in other words , even when a sign change in the carrier type is observed upon electrostatic gating in a spin - voltage device ( as was the case in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , such a change is occurring only in the portion of the sample that is _ not _ in contact with metallic electrodes .",
    "therefore , the gate - voltage - dependences of the spin voltages ( such as those reported ref .",
    "@xcite ) are not a result of the gating of the fermi level of the tss being probed , but are most likely a reflection of the current redistribution in the ti sample .",
    "we have estimated the fermi level @xmath123 in all three devices according to the carrier density obtained from @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "taking the dirac point as @xmath124 , the @xmath123 in device # 1 is estimated to be 0.24 ev , corresponding to a work function @xmath125 = 4.96 ev . since the bottom of the conduction band is at @xmath126 0.21 ev @xcite , the fermi level of device # 1 is located inside the conduction band and @xmath127 0.03 ev .    in device # 2",
    ", @xmath128 is estimated to be @xmath129 ev , corresponding to the work function @xmath130 = 5.27 ev .",
    "the top of the valence band is at @xmath131 ev @xcite , so the fermi level of device # 2 is located inside the bulk band gap and @xmath132 ev .",
    "the two surfaces of device # 3 have different types of carriers .",
    "the @xmath14-type surface has @xmath128 = 0.16 ev and @xmath133 = 5.04 ev , while the @xmath15-type surface has @xmath134 ev and @xmath135 = 5.21 ev . without a gating experiment , it is difficult to tell which surface is the top surface ; nevertheless , the @xmath128 of both surfaces are located inside the bulk band gap .",
    "the band diagrams of bisbtese@xmath0/py contacts are illustrated semi - quantitatively in fig .",
    "due to the difference in the work function , when py is in contact with bisbtese@xmath0 through a tunnel barrier , electrons in py will move into bisbtese@xmath0 to bias the electrostatic potential of the latter , until the electrochemical potential matches at the interface . in this process",
    ", a downward band bending occurs in bisbtese@xmath0 and moves the surface fermi level to @xmath136 ev , which is @xmath1220.16 ev above the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "as already mentioned , @xmath137 in the contact area is determined by the band structures of bisbtese@xmath0 and py , and the carrier density in the bisbtese@xmath0 flakes has no influence on it .",
    "the strength of the band bending is expressed by @xmath138 ( # @xmath139 is the device number ) . based on the estimates of @xmath140",
    "presented above , we obtain @xmath141 to be 0.13 ev in device # 1 , 0.44 ev in device # 2 , and either 0.21 or 0.38 ev in device # 3 . the strength of the rashba spin splitting in the confined 2d states is proportional to the electric field in the @xmath142 direction , which depends linearly on @xmath141 . the experiment and model calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite showed that a small @xmath141 of 0.13 ev would not cause a measurable rashba spin splitting in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , and hence one would not expect its contribution to the @xmath8 measurements in device # 1 .",
    "according to a photoemission study @xcite , the rashba splitting in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is barely visible for @xmath143 0.15 ev and becomes as large as @xmath144 for @xmath141 = 0.35 ev , giving the rashba parameter of @xmath145 ev@xmath146 .",
    "this suggests that in our devices # 2 and # 3 , the band bending is strong enough to cause significant contribution of the rashba - split 2d states in the @xmath8 measurements .",
    "hence , the important question is how the contribution from the rashba - split states can dominate the observed spin signal .",
    "when one looks at the situation , the fermi circle of the tss is always larger than that of the rashba - split states , so the carrier density of the tss is also larger ; if the mobility is the same , the tss would carry more current .",
    "also , the contribution from the outer fermi circle of the rashba - split states is partially canceled by the inner circle ; therefore , the spin signal from the tss , which experiences no such cancellation , would be stronger .    nevertheless , there are some factors which speak for the rashba - split states . first , when @xmath141 is large , there appear more than one pairs of rashba - split states at the fermi level .",
    "for instance , a second pair of rashba - split states has been observed in photoemission experiments @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , the total spin signal contributed by all pairs could exceed that from the tss .",
    "second , as @xmath147 increases , the fermi circles of the tss start to be deformed and show hexagonal warping @xcite . in a deformed fermi circle ,",
    "spin is no long strictly perpendicular to the wavevector .",
    "since the fermi circle of the tss is larger than the others and the hexagonal warping grows as @xmath148 , it is more prone to the deformation and the in - plane spin component gets weaker .",
    "therefore , the hexagonal warping helps the rashba - split states to win over the tss in the contribution to the spin signal .",
    "third , as shown in fig .",
    "7 , the inner circle of the rashba - split states can shrink to a point when @xmath149 . at this point",
    ", theoretical calculation @xcite shows that the spin signal coming from the rashba - split states can be stronger than that from the tss .",
    "according to the theory @xcite , for the current - induced @xmath10 generated by a single helical channel , we have @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the fermi wave vector of the helical channel , @xmath152 is the width of the device , @xmath153 is the effective spin polarization of the fm detector , and @xmath154 is the induced spin polarization per unit current . for a py spin detector",
    ", we can take @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath154 is determined by the spin texture of the channel and @xmath156 is expected for an ideal tss @xcite .    in reality , the spin - detection efficiency @xmath157 is not 100% and eq .",
    "( 3 ) is modified to @xmath158    as discussed in sec .",
    "iii - c , for device # 1 , the measured spin signal is mostly due to the tss even though a major fraction of the current is carried by bulk carriers . in this case , @xmath157 can be estimated by using eq .",
    "( 4 ) . specifically , we have @xmath159 m@xmath117 and @xmath160 @xmath118 m for device # 1 , and the band alignment at the interface fixes the fermi level of the tss beneath the fm electrode at @xmath161 ev , which corresponds to @xmath162 @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "these values lead to @xmath164 0.54% .",
    "such a low detection efficiency is probably due to the coexistence of the bulk states .",
    "the spin signals in devices # 2 and # 3 are supposedly dominated by the rashba - split states , but the reason for their dominance is not quantitatively understood .",
    "hence , the spin - detection efficiency in devices # 2 and # 3 can not be estimated at this stage .      while the exact mechanism of the sign reversal in @xmath8 is to be elucidated in future , the discovery that the current - induced spin polarization can be switched by changing the chemical potential of a ti is of significant practical importance , because it allows us to conceive a spin - transistor device , in which the output spin polarization is switched by electrostatic gating . in this regard , it is conceivable that when the ti layer is thin enough , back gating can change the chemical potential of the ti throughout thickness , leading to a change in the band bending at the top surface beneath the fm electrode .",
    "such a tuning of the band bending would allow us to control the dominant spin helicity and the spin - transistor operation can be realized .",
    "for the exploitation of this intriguing and useful effect , further studies of its mechanism is strongly called for .",
    "we discovered that the current - induced spin polarization in bisbtese@xmath0 flakes can be reversed depending on the fermi level .",
    "in particular , samples with a small fermi energy present the spin polarization that is opposite to what is expected for the topological surface states . this is most likely due to the contribution from rashba - split 2d states created by a strong band bending occurring at the interface of the ti and the ferromagnetic spin detector .",
    "while its exact mechanism is to be elucidated in future studies , this effect provides an operation principle for a spin - transistor device in which the output spin polarization is controlled by electrostatic gating .",
