    "at the next generation of linear @xmath3 colliders the experimental precision of @xmath4 will exceed current standards by one order of magnitude . to ensure the success and strengthen the physics case of such a machine , a precise understanding of the theoretical predictions is of paramount importance . in particular bhabha scattering is important for luminosity monitoring , and hence a vital ingredient of almost every measurement .",
    "recent studies @xcite have focused on the calculation of the two - loop qed matrix element to massless bhabha scattering , i.e. the photon and the electron are treated as massless particles . to further increase the theoretical understanding of the bhabha cross section and to control collinear singularities we consider the electron to be a massive particle . at the energy scale",
    "foreseen for the next generation of @xmath3 colliders , electroweak corrections can not be ignored .",
    "while it is certainly a good approximation to consider small angle bhabha scattering to be highly dominated by pure qed corrections , this does not apply to the whole phase space . taking the electron mass into account in the genuine qed calculation will open the door to more involved multi - scale electroweak higher order calculations .",
    "here we are presenting the first progress made towards a complete two - loop calculation .",
    "at the born level the bhabha scattering process @xmath5 is characterized through an @xmath6- and a @xmath7-channel photon exchange diagram .",
    "one - loop radiative corrections constitute the two - loop calculation in the form of @xmath8 contributions to the cross section . to generate the diagrams in the form of a postscript file , as well as in symbolic notation for further algebraic manipulation , we use diana , the diagram analyser by tentyukov and fleischer @xcite  .",
    "we choose to work in the feynman gauge   gauge . ] .",
    "this has the advantage that tadpole contributions are energy independent and hence do not contribute to the physical cross section .",
    "self - energy , vertex and box diagrams make their appearance in equal parts as @xmath6- and @xmath7-channel diagrams .",
    "the following ten diagrams have been calculated .",
    "+    we decompose the full one - loop matrix element into 12 amplitudes , that is in fact into 24 amplitudes , counting the @xmath6- and @xmath7-channel contributions separately . for compactness",
    "we omit the spinors .",
    "the richness in structure is indeed only required for the box contributions .",
    "the self - energies and vertices contribute to only two of the structures below .",
    "we would like to remark at this point that the products of dirac @xmath9 matrices @xmath10 to @xmath11 can in principle be simplified at the cost of artificially introducing @xmath12 , which we decided to avoid altogether .",

    "it is sufficient to calculate one box diagram and obtain the form factors of the remaining three box diagrams via those symmetry relations .    to reduce the various one - loop integrals we rely upon two different techniques .",
