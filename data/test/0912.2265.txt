    "the energy loss of hard partons propagating through the soft medium created in heavy - ion collisions has long been regarded as a promising tool to gain information on the medium properties @xcite .",
    "radiative energy loss , i.e. the idea that medium - induced radiation predominantly carries away energy from a hard parent parton has been rather successful in describing not only the hadronic nuclear suppression factor for central collisions but also the effects of changing medium geometry @xcite .",
    "calculations within dynamical evolution models in various formalisms @xcite have improved on this result and show also agreement with measured hard back - to - back correlations @xcite and the measured suppression of protons @xcite .    nevertheless , there are indications that a radiative energy loss picture fails to describe the suppression of heavy quarks as seen in the measurements of the single - electron spectra @xcite .",
    "energy loss due to elastic collisions with the medium @xcite has been suggested as a possible solution to this problem .",
    "such calculations indicate a large component of elastic energy loss also for light quarks and gluons .",
    "however , the pathlength dependence of elastic energy loss does not agree with the observed response of the suppression to a large pathlength bias as probed in back - to - back hadron correlations @xcite .    in the light of these inconclusive findings",
    ", it would be desirable to have a baseline calculation of elastic energy loss which treats the relevant physics in as detailed manner as possible .",
    "in particular , many analytical calculations of elastic energy loss assume eikonal propagation of a hard parton , however in a more realistic description even hard partons , @xmath2  gev , can be deflected from their path by interactions with the medium . similarly , in processes like @xmath3 there is not only a change of energy between incoming and outgoing parton but also a change in parton species which influences the subsequent interaction probability of the outgoing parton .",
    "finally , in scattering processes in which the energy is distributed almost evenly among the outgoing partons , it is not justified to use the picture of energy from a hard parton being lost into the medium . clearly , one also has to account for situations in which both partons after a scattering process are hard or both become part of the medium , or in which the identity of the leading parton changes .    in the present manuscript , we present work towards such a baseline computation . for this purpose",
    ", we develop a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation for the hard parton s interaction with the medium , as this is an appropriate framework to account for all the above mentioned effects .",
    "in addition , we also try to to give estimates on the uncertainties of such a computation .",
    "similar , in some aspects even more ambitious approaches are the mc models jewel ( jet evolution with energy loss ) @xcite and martini ( modular algorithm for relativistic treatment of heavy ion interactions ) @xcite , both of which consider pqcd interactions of a parton shower with a thermal medium and include both elastic and radiative energy - loss components . in jewel ,",
    "one models shower evolution and medium - induced radiation in a static ( no flow , @xmath4 constant ) medium , and in martini the vacuum showering is assumed to cease when the hydrodynamic evolution starts , while our approach focuses on the leading partons . like martini , also we utilize a realistic well - tested 3-dimensional hydrodynamical description of the medium ( in our case azimuthal symmetry in central collisions , and longitudinal boost symmetry but 3-d flow ) instead of a static medium applied in jewel .",
    "in the following , we make the assumption that the medium can be characterized as a thermal gas of quasi - free quarks and gluons and that its interactions with a hard parton can be treated as incoherent @xmath5 processes in leading - order pqcd . we stress that these assumptions need not be realized for the medium produced in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions  any discrepancy between the calculation presented here and the data will reflect this .",
    "we model the medium by means of a hydrodynamical calculation @xcite with the initial state obtained from the saturation of the phase space with minijets @xcite .",
    "this provides the medium temperature @xmath4 at each spacetime point . for the moment , we assume that only the scatterings with a partonic medium are relevant and ignore the possibility that a hadronic medium might interact with a hard parton",
    ". thus the mean free path of hard partons becomes infinite once the medium temperature drops below the critical temperature @xmath6 .",
    "given the local @xmath4 , the distribution of scattering partners is given by the fermi - dirac ( bose - einstein ) distribution for quarks ( gluons ) respectively .",
    "we also account for the 3-d hydrodynamical flow of the fluid cell .",
    "our approach , most specifically the assumption that the relevant interactions can be described in terms of partonic pqcd interaction , shares many features with parton cascade models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , unlike in parton cascade models where the partonic pqcd interactions are assumed to describe the whole off - equilibrium bulk medium , we assume that the bulk is essentially thermalized and use explicit pqcd interactions only to account for the non - equilibrium dynamics between hard parton and medium .    in the following , we first give a more detailed account of the hydrodynamical simulation , the parton - medium scattering rates and details of the mc implementation .",
    "then we present our results for the partonic and hadronic nuclear modification factor @xmath7 and for qcd - matter tomography , and also discuss the relevant uncertainties . some technical details regarding the scattering rate calculations",
    "can be found in the appendix .      in the present exploratory stage",
    "we consider only the cleanest possible case , ( nearly ) central @xmath8 collisions in the mid - rapidity region . the produced qcd matter , which evolves and flows 3-dimensionally , can to a first realistic approximation then be described by using the nonviscous , azimuthally symmetric , longitudinally boost - invariant hydrodynamic framework .",
    "the 1 + 1 d hydrodynamical framework , which we apply here for the qcd medium evolution , is presented in detail in ref .",
    "the initial energy density @xmath9 for the hydrodynamics is here obtained from pqcd - minijet production @xcite and final - state saturation as computed in the ekrt - model @xcite .",
    "the transverse profile of @xmath10 is assumed to scale with the number of binary collisions , and thermalization is assumed to take place at formation ( i.e. at saturation ) .",
    "for central au+au collisions at @xmath11  gev , we thus initialize the hydrodynamics at ( see table 1 in @xcite ) @xmath12  fm/@xmath13 , where the longitudinal proper time is defined as @xmath14 .",
    "the transverse flow is assumed to be zero at @xmath15 .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) in our hydrodynamic background contains a high-@xmath4 qgp phase , a low-@xmath4 hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) phase , and a mixed phase between them .",
    "the qgp here is an ideal gas of gluons and three flavours of massless quarks and antiquarks obeying a bag - eos , while the hrg is an ideal gas of all hadrons and hadron resonances up to @xmath16  gev .",
    "the maxwell construction gives the mixed phase , and the bag constant @xmath17  mev fixes the phase transition temperature to @xmath18  mev .",
    "we terminate the hydrodynamic evolution at a single decoupling temperature @xmath19  mev . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the measured pion and kaon spectra and proton multiplicity in central au+au collisions at rhic can be reproduced very nicely with such hydrodynamical set - up , once the thermal hadron spectra have been computed via the cooper - frye decoupling procedure and once the strong and electromagnetic hadronic decays have been accounted for . for more details , as well as for plots of the initial energy density and of the phase boundary locations in the @xmath20 plane , we refer the reader to ref .",

    "the singularities arising in forward and backward scatterings of massless partons  appearing in the scattering amplitudes at @xmath45  need to be regularized in some physically meaningful way . for the moment , an exact field - theoretical solution to this non - equilibrium problem is not known .",
    "one possible treatment is to apply resummed thermal ( equilibrium ) propagators separately for the longitudinal and transverse components , as is done in the amy approach @xcite .",

    "( see fig .",

    "also the leading - parton flavour - conversions are usually neglected in the eikonal energy - loss simulations .",
    "interestingly , this effect is not symmetric between quarks and gluons : due the collision rates , there are more flavour conversions related to gluons than to quarks , and a quark from a @xmath152 leading - parton conversion is then more likely to become a punch - through parton than a gluon from a @xmath153 conversion .",

    "doubling the value of @xmath158 to 0.3 ( middle panel ) makes the distribution move off - center .",

    "however , our results show an unfortunately strong dependence on cutoff parameters which are in essence supposed to effectively account for the physics of a dynamically running @xmath158 and thermal field - theoretical processes generating a screening mass .",
    "thus for a reasonable variation of these parameters there are pairs @xmath174 for which the @xmath155 data can be described by elastic processes alone .",
