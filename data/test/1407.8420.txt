    "recent experimental setups have demonstrated raman and ramsey spectroscopy on narrow atomic clock transitions using cold atoms trapped in 1d magic wavelength optical lattices with unprecedented precision below one hertz  @xcite . while on the one hand in this extreme limit even weak atom - atom interactions cause perturbations , on the other hand such setups provide a unique testing ground for measuring such tiny corrections  @xcite . from the point of view of an atomic clock or",
    "a superradiant laser  @xcite interactions constitute a perturbation . in particular at higher particle densities dipole - dipole interaction and collective decay tend to introduce shifts and dephasing  @xcite , which limit the useful interrogation time .",
    "as these are essentially bipartite interactions , they can not be corrected simply by rephasing techniques . while for @xmath2 with its mhz - linewidth , decay is no major limitation at the moment , alternative approaches with e.g. calcium atoms have already reached this limit  @xcite .    over the past couple of years a considerable number of theoretical proposals to deal with metrology bounds",
    "have been put forward ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in our recent theoretical proposal",
    "@xcite we suggested that by a proper modification of the standard ramsey interferometry technique ( srt ) on interacting two - level ensembles , the detrimental effect of collective decay can be minimized and surprisingly to some extent even reversed .",
    "the technique takes advantage of the atomic interactions to suppress decay by transferring the atomic excitation to subradiant collective states .",
    "we dub this method protective ramsey technique ( prt )",
    ". it might be less surprising in hindsight , but still is puzzling , that an optically highly excited collective state of atomic dipoles can be prevented from decay via destructive interferences of the field emitted by the individual dipoles .",
    "interestingly , one finds an unexpected fast growth of the lifetime of the excited states with the particle number . employing the proposed techniques these long - lived states",
    "can then be used for an enhanced ramsey spectroscopy allowing for a significantly higher precision than even for independently decaying atoms paving the way for implementations of this technique with 3d lattices .",
    "the method requires an additional individually controlled single particle spin rotation , which is added after the first and reversed before the final ramsey pulse . in consequence , the total ensemble spin is shifted towards zero by spreading the individual spins by predefined amounts almost homogeneously around the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere .",
    "thus the ensemble becomes classically nonradiative during free evolution . while this should obviously work for tightly packed ensembles confined within a cubic wavelength ,",
    "we demonstrate that it works almost as well in 3d regular lattices . in this case",
    "it is not a priori clear which would be the most long lived configuration , but the minimum decay rate can be inferred from the eigenvalues of the collective decay liouvillian operator .",
    "it is of course an extra technical challenge to implement the required optimal transformation as it in general requires individual spin addressing . in practice , however , in many cases , a proper use of phases introduced by a designed lattice and excitation geometry turns out to be sufficient to get very close to such an optimal state with a single laser applied at an optimal angle .",
    "it is generally thought that , in order to beat the @xmath1 scaling of the sensitivity of srt applied on @xmath0 noninteracting particles , the state preparation stage should involve the generation of nonclassical multipartite entangled states ( such as spin squeezed states )  @xcite .",

    ".    we will now look at systems of small atom numbers where the protected states @xmath82 , with @xmath83 being the ground state , can be readily expressed in both the collective and uncoupled bases . for two atoms the protected state is unique ( @xmath84 ) and is simply the asymmetric state @xmath85 observe that the transformation that diagonalizes the hamiltonian automatically renders the liouvillian in diagonal form . denoting the mutual decay rate by @xmath86 , two decay channels with @xmath87 and @xmath88 are obtained . for closely spaced atoms , @xmath89 can reach values close to @xmath57 such that @xmath90 and the state @xmath91 can be protected from decoherence very well .",
    "since analytical and numerical results for the two atom case are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will only stress one conclusion that emerges from this analysis , i.e. , even for moderate distances the time for which the optimal sensitivity is obtained roughly scales as @xmath92 .",
    "this indicates that the evolution of the system is mainly within the protected subspace , a claim that will be investigated further in the next section .        for three atoms",
    "there is still only one choice of @xmath84 . however , the resulting state is somewhat more complicated in both coupled and uncoupled bases , i.e.    @xmath93    @xmath94    above we have used the short form for the tensor products in the uncoupled basis and an additional index in the coupled basis .",
    "the complete label of a state ( different from the ones with @xmath95 ) in the coupled basis as used here is @xmath96 , where as usual @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in the symmetric subspace , characterized by @xmath95 ( with states on the surface of the bloch sphere ) , there are @xmath99 states . the additional index @xmath100 is needed in order to distinguish among degenerate states inside the bloch sphere ( note that there is a certain unitary freedom in how the change of basis is performed , i.e. in how the collective degenerate states are defined ) .",
    "these other states that lie inside the bloch sphere ( equal in number to @xmath101 ) , we loosely dub asymmetric states .",

    "there are four such states with maximal @xmath102 , and therefore @xmath103 asymmetric states inside the sphere .",
    "since there are only two combinations of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the remaining states are degenerate and therefore distinguished by an additional index @xmath106 .",

    "the resulting states with their corresponding decay rates are depicted in fig .",
    "thee phase - spread transformation that leads to the protected state @xmath108 simply ensures that the system s evolution mostly runs through the states on the side , characterized by smaller decay rates @xmath110 .",
    "we are now in the position to extend our investigations to larger systems in various configurations .",
    "first , we show results for six atoms in a chain , where the separation is varied and the scan over different rotations ( i.e. over all possible sets of @xmath111 ) is performed .",
    "we then explain the obtained results by taking a close look at the collective decay properties as derived from a diagonalization of the liouvillian and find scaling laws for the characteristic timescale of the most protected subspace consistent with the numerical results .",
    "then , we show that the performance of prt can beat the typical @xmath1 scaling . finally , we extend our numerics to a cube configuration of eight atoms which should be the building block for understanding the application of this method to dense 3d lattices .      to begin with ,",

    "the immediate conclusion is that one can use such techniques to turn cooperative decay into an advantage instead of treating it as a detrimental effect . for distances larger than @xmath116 ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4]c ) , the srt beats any prt we used for a fairly simple reason . at these distances",

    ", the lowest order nearest - neighbor dissipative coupling has a negative value , thus favoring as many pairs of equal phase as possible . as mentioned before , the majority of the couplings is constituted by nearest neighbor pairs , but there are also couplings in the planar and cubic diagonal , which becomes quite evident when looking at the sensitivity for an alternating phase distribution , i.e. every nearest neighbor pair is separated by a phase of exactly @xmath156 . here ,",
    "a tradeoff between the next - neighbor and diagonal couplings can be observed as the closest couplings decrease the sensitivity due to a negative sign and a phase difference of @xmath156 while the diagonal ones , which are also negative in sign , yet possess no phase difference , increase the sensitivity .",
    "finally , the srt sensitivity is obtained by including the implicit phase imprinting caused by a laser pulse that hits one face of the cube first , propagates further and hits the second face with an extra phase of @xmath157 . at magic wavelength distance",
    "this amounts to a phase of approximately @xmath158 , which clearly yields the worst sensitivity as the contributions from the pairs with an unfavorable overall sign outweigh the advantageous ones .    to sum up , for the cubic unit cell , where an implicit geometric phase imprinting has been reversed , it is the blue line ( filled triangles ) of fig .",

    "despite the common expectation that pairwise interactions and collective dynamics will introduce shifts and noise to ultrahigh precision spectroscopy setups in dense ensembles , we have shown , that using appropriate intermediate preparation steps , these effects can not only be minimized but sometimes even used to improve the signal to noise ratio for ramsey type measurements . transferring excitation to the so - called protected subspaces prevents errors which can not be corrected by common rephasing pulse schemes .",
    "an important example is the prevention of superradiant decay by a population transfer to subradiant states .",
    "surprisingly , the lifetime of these subradiant states grows very fast with particle density and number , which is reflected in the scaling of both the minimum sensitivity and the maximally allowed interrogation times .",
    "while the main focus of this paper is the case of ensembles of cold atoms coupled via dipole - dipole interaction through the electromagnetic vacuum , the idea of using protected subspaces to improve precision spectroscopy can be extended to more general cases of engineered baths .",
    "enhancing the interaction of atoms by coupling to a highly confined field mode  @xcite induces long range mutual interactions between any pair of atoms yielding even stronger effects .",
    "recently , analogous implementations using nv - centers or superconducting qubits coupled to cpw transmission lines or resonators showed surprisingly strong effects  @xcite .    in principle , our method in the most general form requires single particle control of the excitation phase .",
    "luckily , in many cases of experimental realizations of such a generalized ramsey method the required phase pattern has a lot of regularity and symmetries , which can be used to simplify the procedure . as a first guess one can think of an automatic phase imprinting achieved by the sample s geometry , where the phase front of a plane wave laser hits each element of a regular lattice with a different phase @xmath160 , with @xmath153 being the wavenumber of the laser and @xmath161 denoting the positions of the atoms . addressing a linear chain transversally at right angle from the side leads to an equal phase for all particles . by tilting the laser and thus introducing an angle @xmath100 between the laser s propagation direction and the elongation of the chain the relative excitation phase can be tuned as @xmath162 .",
    "alternatively , a magnetic field gradient applied for a prescribed time , resulting in a spatial gradient of the difference in splitting of @xmath163 and @xmath164 among the individual two - level emitters , will facilitate the accumulation of a relative phase between the atoms much in the form desired in our scheme .",
    "phase gradients could also be engineered by the differential light shift of off - resonant laser fields . in principle , these phases can be even tailored in 3d . finally , an implementation in the framework of engineered baths , e.g. with superconducting qubits coupled to cpw transmission lines , could also be realized .",
    "here one has indeed individual spin control .",
    "a more thorough discussion on practical considerations has been provided in ref .",
