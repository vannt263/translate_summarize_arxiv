    "the cyg  x-1 data presented here were obtained by the pca onboard rxte , mostly gained through our monitoring campaign 19982002 ( for a description of the data see @xcite ) .",
    "we split each light curve into segments of 1s length and determine the mean flux of each segment .",
    "the segments are binned into 41 equally segmented flux bins , for each of which we calculate the power spectral density ( psd ) of all contained lightcurve segments via the dft ( see , e.g. , ) .    from all periodograms of each flux bin the mean psd is determined using standard methods . for better statistics we chose to take into account only flux bins containing at least 20 periodograms .",
    "integrating the poisson noise corrected psd over the range @xmath0@xmath1hz , we arrive at the squared fractional rms variability . in a next step",
    "we multiply the fractional rms variability by the mean flux of the bin , to obtain the absolute rms variability @xmath2 .",
    "for all bins of each observation we plot @xmath2 over flux @xmath3 and fit a linear function in two different representations . by fitting @xmath4 , two characterizing values are determined : slope @xmath5 and intercept @xmath6 on the @xmath2 axis .",
    "the gradient of the @xmath2-@xmath3-trend @xmath5 is equivalent to the fractional rms variability of the light curve .    alternatively to intercept @xmath6 , it was proposed to determine the physically meaningful intercept @xmath7 on the @xmath3 axis by fitting @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath5 is interpreted as the variable component of the lightcurve , then @xmath7 represents a second component of it which does not follow the linear @xmath2-@xmath3-trend . in deriving results",
    ", it should be kept in mind that @xmath7 , which is identical to @xmath9 , and @xmath5 are not independent values for the characterization of the rms - flux - relation .",
    "generally , there is a good linear relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the hard state , which is reflected by the stable pearson correlation coefficient in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsfluxvstime ] .",
    "we also notice coincidence of the change of the general long term behavior of cyg  x-1 from a `` quiet hard state '' to a `` flaring hard state '' in 1998 may @xcite with a shift in the values of slope @xmath5 and the intercepts .",
    "the shape of the rms - flux - relation in the soft states of 1996 and 2001/2002 changes continuously between waviness and approximate linearity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : softstate ] ) .    during",
    "`` failed state transitions''(fst ) , i.e. , during times when the source reached its intermediate state , the linear rms - flux relation breaks down .",
    "we examined four fst : 1998 july 15 , 1999 dec 05 , 2000 nov 03 , and 2001  jan  29 ( indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsfluxvstime ] by dotted lines ) . comparing these events with the neighboring hard state observations ,",
    "we notice that the rms - flux - relations of 1999 december  05 and 2000 november 03  being strictly linear before and after  change to an arch - like appearance during the fst itself ( see fig .  [ fig : failed ] ) .",
    "the other two examined fst also deviate from the linear relation , but these deviations are not as prominent .",
    "an explanation of the rms - flux - relation seems to be the modification of a theory which explains the psd of gbhc by the superposition of accretion disk ( ad ) instabilities occuring at several radii in the ad that are propagated towards the innermost region of the disk .",
    "local @xmath10 variations , which are caused by short term changes of the disk viscosity and whose time scale is dependent on radius , are superimposed on long term @xmath10 modulations . if the fractional amplitude of the @xmath10 variations is independent of the long term @xmath10 , a linear flux - rms relation will be observed @xcite . the rms - flux - relation will break down if the corona is severely disturbed",
    "this seems to be the case during the intermediate state of cyg  x-1 , in agreement with earlier results for the behavior of x - ray time lags @xcite . here",
    ", the observed x - ray time lag is much larger than during the normal hard state , which could indicate changes in the geometry of the ad corona , possibly related to the observed radio emitting outflow ."
