    "the purpose of the present work is to improve the recent saclay - lyon ( sl ) study  @xcite on the strangeness electromagnetic production from the proton .",
    "this latter investigation was based upon an effective hadronic lagrangian in the lowest ( tree ) approximation , often called the isobar approximation . in a number of aspects",
    "one might safely say that sl is an improved version of its predecessors dealing with the same strangeness production processes . in particular",
    ", it has incorporated the _",
    "s-_channel nucleonic resonances with spin 3/2 and 5/2 , expected to be important should the model keep adequate as energy increases . in ref .",
    "@xcite such resonances were also considered .",
    "however , there the components of the amplitude growing undesirably with increasing channel energy were taken away by hand .    as we will see later ,",
    "these contributions arise from the non - resonant terms associated to each considered resonance with spin  @xmath5  1/2 . in the sl study this was avoided by modifying the vertices and propagators in a manner adopted for spin 3/2 resonances in refs .",
    "@xcite : a straightforward extension to higher spins , while preserving the electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "this modification , however , has introduced an unwanted behavior for spin @xmath6 hyperonic resonances exchanged in the _ u-_channel : the corresponding propagators become singular in the physical region . thus in the sl approach only spin 1/2 hyperons have been considered in the _",
    "u-_channel exchange .",
    "the phenomenological success of the sl model might imply that , within the present state of the data , the main contributions from baryonic higher spin resonances come mainly from the _ s_-channel resonances ( we will come back to this point in section iv ) .    in the study of pion photoproduction ,",
    "the rensselaer polytechnic institute ( rpi ) group  @xcite has shown that of several different forms of the spin 3/2 propagator in the literature only one of them has a correct inverse .",
    "also the authors pointed out that there are extra degrees of freedom associated with the interaction vertices involving a spin 3/2 particle . by exploiting these facts , they successfully fitted the existing photo - pion data by the amplitudes generated from effective hadronic lagrangians , and made predictions for some observables as well as the @xmath7 ratio for the @xmath8 vertex .",
    "a similar strategy has been applied also by the rpi group  @xcite to the photo- and electro - production of the @xmath9 meson .",
    "it seems quite natural then , as an extension of the saclay - lyon approach  @xcite , as well as the works of the rpi group  @xcite , to exploit this treatment for spin 3/2 particles in the study of the photo- and electro - production of the strangeness off the nucleon .",
    "yet , one needs to incorporate properly the _",
    "u-_channel exchanges in the phenomenological approaches .",
    "the reasons for such an effort are mainly two - fold : _",
    "( i ) _ a consistent treatment of the higher spin baryonic resonances in both _ s- _ _ and _ _ u-_channels , _ ( ii ) _ very likely , more sophisticated formalisms will be needed to interpret the forthcoming data from new facilities , _",
    "e.g. _ , the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) , the electron stretcher accelerator ( elsa ) , the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) , and the 8  gev synchrotron facility ( spring-8 ) under construction in japan .    in this paper , we work out the general expressions valid for the processes with a kaon @xmath10 ( @xmath11  @xmath12 ) and an hyperon @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) in the final state . a selected set of @xmath15 channel observables for the following processes are also reported : @xmath1 ( @xmath2 2.5 gev ) , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "similar investigations with the @xmath16 hyperons in the final state , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath17 and @xmath18 channels , are in progress and the results will be reported elsewhere .    in section ii , the approach by the rpi group is extended to the photo- and electroproduction of strangeness through _",
    "s-_channel nucleonic resonances of spin 3/2 .",
    "the off - shell parameters are introduced in the interaction lagrangians , and the dependence on these parameters of the non - pole part of the invariant amplitudes is clarified .",
    "the approaches used previously where the off - shell effects were ignored are placed in the present context .",
    "section iii is devoted to the treatment of spin 3/2 resonances in the _",
    "the direct calculation proceeds along the same line as for the _",
    "s-_channel resonance exchange .",
    "the substitution rule which emerges from the direct calculation is worked out , leading to simple rules to obtain the _",
    "u-_channel invariant amplitudes from the _ s-_channel ones . in section iv",
    ", we give our results and we discuss the dependence of the relevant observables on the off - shell parameters .",

    "once we obtain the amplitude , it is easy to establish its relation to the corresponding one obtained by renard & renard  @xcite as well as to the one in sl  @xcite .",

    ". then the inclusion of off - shell effects ( going from model a to b ) brings them back close to their sl model values , stabilizing them for the c model .",
    "these two consecutive variations might come from the observation  @xcite that in the sl model these two resonances are rather strongly correlated .",

    "the global increase of the _ t-_channel strengths when discarding a spin 5/2 resonance is a manifestation of the duality hypothesis ( the interplay between s- and _ t-_channel strengths ) in the strangeness sector , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the above considerations indicate strongly that the underlying dynamics retained in this work are tightly constrained by the available data base .",
    "hence , the reported sensitivities to off - shell treatments are not likely to be altered significantly by the rest of the free parameters of the models introduced here .",
    "in obtaining models b and c we have treated the three parameters ( x , y , and z ) as free ones .",

    "moreover , all three parameters of the n7 resonance are stable upon comparing b and c models .",
    "notice that one of the main motivations in introducing the off - shell effects is to cure an undesirable increase in the predicted photoproduction total cross - section above roughly 1.5 gev . by examining the non - pole part @xmath252 of the amplitudes in appendix  [ app : invamp ]",

    "@xcite have discussed extensively different `` choices '' of these free parameters , and especially fixing two of them , as reported in the literature  @xcite .",

    "hence , decreasing the magnitude of the @xmath258 parameter by roughly a factor of 2 ( between models b and d ) leads to an increase of about 20% of the magnitude of the @xmath13-parameter . in figure",

    "other observables discussed in this paper show similar behaviors while comparing models b and d. the closeness of the predictions for the observables can be understood by noticing that the @xmath259 parameter in model b has a value compatible with zero , and the contributions due to the @xmath13-dependent terms dominate numerically over those coming from the @xmath259-dependent ones .    in the case of pion photoproduction , the rpi - group  @xcite found that imposing @xmath255 and @xmath256 leads to a significant increase of the @xmath200 .",

    "moreover , we recall that the model b ( c ) studied here contains one ( two ) spin-3/2 resonance and five spin-1/2 resonances .    to our knowledge , there are _ a priori _ no bounds on the values of the off - shell parameters . however , remembering that the off - shell freedom comes in only from the non - pole terms , and that the principal contribution from a given resonance must correspond to the propagation of its proper spin , we expect that the corresponding non - pole parts might not dominate the pole part",
    ". this would give reasonable upper - bound to which values @xmath258 , @xmath13 , and @xmath259 may take .",
    "this expectation was verified in the case of the models reported here .",
    "finally , in the case of @xmath209 hyperonic resonance ( model c ) , very small values of the off - shell parameters , as well as those of coupling constants resulting from the minimization endorse our previous affirmations : contributions from this resonance are not required by the existing data base , and the smallness of the relevant free parameters explains why its inclusion in the underlying dynamics does not have significant consequences , neither on the @xmath200 nor on the predicted observables .",
    "in the present article , focused on the electromagnetic production of strangeness , we have been concerned with the improvement on the effective hadronic lagrangian approaches by incorporating the correct spin-3/2 resonances propagators and what is called off - shell effects entering the vertices connected to these resonances .",
    "the work presented here allows us to preserve the gauge invariance of the formalism , to ensure that each propagator associated with a spin-3/2 exchanged baryon has an inverse , and to include simultaneously both @xmath261 and @xmath262 spin-3/2 resonances .",
    "applying our approach to the @xmath15 channels observables investigated in ref  @xcite , we have emphasized that the photo- and electro - production of @xmath263 observables show significant sensitivity to the off - shell effects , while these effects do not lead to measurable manifestations in the @xmath199 radiative capture branching ratio with stopped kaons .",
    "the numerical results reported here are of course heavily based on the existing data . given the inconsistencies  @xcite within the present data , the dynamical content of the models reported here will very likely evolve with the forthcoming high quality data from several experiments , both ongoing and planned .",
    "hence the presented numerical results should be considered as guidelines for relative effects .",
    "the efforts in refining the phenomenological approaches are then meant to provide us with appropriate tools to interpret the upcoming data .    applying the formalism derived in this paper to the available data - base ,",
    "our results show that the photoproduction data , especially polarization asymmetries , are crucial in pinning down the role of off - shell effects .",

    "note also that there has not been any unique way the unitarization should be carried on .",

    "we observe that in the current stage of development , the quarks models and the ehl approaches are somewhat complementary . with available data and upon minimization",
    ", ehl can supply the values of combined coupling constants like @xmath215 and @xmath216 in our present approach .",
