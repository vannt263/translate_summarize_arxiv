    "bg geminorum was discovered by hoffmeister ( 1933 ) and jensch ( 1938 ) as a possible rv tau star with an uncertain period of @xmath0 60 days . with a photographic magnitude of @xmath0 14 ,",
    "the star languished in the general catalog of variable stars ( @xcite ) until 1992 , when we began photometric observations to improve the period estimate and to verify the rv tau classification .",
    "early data revealed a repeatable ellipsoidal variation with a long period , instead of the more irregular variation expected from an rv tau star .",
    "additional photometry allowed us to refine the period and plan spectroscopic observations . together with the photometry ,",
    "high quality spectra acquired around the orbit establish bg gem as a rare eclipsing binary system with an unseen primary star and a lobe - filling k supergiant secondary star .",
    "this paper describes our data and analysis .",
    "we begin with a summary of the observations in  2 , continue with a detailed analysis in  3 , and conclude with the discussion in  4 .",
    "various student observers acquired optical photometry of bg gem with standard vr@xmath1i@xmath1 filters and a photometrics pm512 camera mounted on the wellesley college 0.6-m sawyer telescope .",
    "observations beginning 23 july 1997 used a tk1024 back - illuminated ccd .",
    "we processed the data using standard tasks within noao iraf .",
    "each image was bias - subtracted , dark - subtracted , and flat - fielded using twilight flats .",
    "we extracted photometry of bg gem and several comparison stars using phot with a 3  aperture and a 3  sky annulus 17  from the star .",
    "wellesley is not a photometric site ; we thus derived photometry of bg gem relative to comparisons verified to be non - variable .",
    "the relative photometry has 1@xmath5 probable errors of @xmath60.011 mag at v , @xmath60.014 mag at r@xmath1 , and @xmath60.011 mag at i@xmath1 based on repeat observations of comparison stars in the field of bg gem .",
    "table 1 lists the relative photometry of bg gem and a comparison star as a function of time ( the heliocentric julian date , jd ) and photometric phase @xmath7 defined below .",
    "p. berlind , m. calkins , and several other observers acquired low resolution optical spectra of bg gem with fast , a high throughput , slit spectrograph mounted at the fred l. whipple observatory 1.5-m telescope on mount hopkins , arizona ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used a 300 g mm@xmath8 grating blazed at 4750  , a 3  slit , and a thinned loral 512 @xmath9 2688 ccd .",
    "these spectra cover 38007500   at a resolution of @xmath0 6  .",
    "we flux- and wavelength - calibrated the spectra in iraf . after trimming the ccd frames at each end of the slit , we corrected for the bias level , flat - fielded each frame , applied an illumination correction , and derived a full wavelength solution from calibration lamps acquired immediately after each exposure . the wavelength solution for each frame has a probable error of @xmath60.51.0  .",
    "we extracted object and sky spectra using the optimal extraction algorithm within apextract .",
    "the absolute flux - calibration for each night relies on observations of 2 - 5 standard stars ( barnes & hayes 1982 ) and has an uncertainty of @xmath65%10% .",
    "nights with clouds or poor seeing have poor absolute calibrations ( @xmath6 20% or worse ) but good relative calibrations .",
    "figure 1 shows a typical spectrum of bg gem . the spectrum resembles a late g or early k star , with a red continuum and strong absorption from the g band , mg  i , na  i , and the ba  i blend at @xmath106495 .",
    "strong h  i balmer emission lines are also visible , with h10 and h11 present on some spectra .",
    "the h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 lines are often double peaked .",
    "some spectra show a weak blue continuum and weak he  i emission at 5876   and 6678  .",
    "there is no evidence for absorption lines from a hot , early - type star .    to analyze the spectra , we measured continuum magnitudes and indices of strong absorption and emission lines using narrow passbands ( oconnell 1973 ; worthey 1994 ) .",
    "table 2 lists the central wavelength @xmath10 and width @xmath13 for each .",
    "the continuum magnitudes are normalized to the zero - point of the v magnitude scale , @xmath14 = @xmath15 @xmath1621.1 , where @xmath17 is the flux in the passband .",
    "the absorption and emission indices , derived using sbands within iraf , are @xmath18 = @xmath162.5 log(@xmath17/@xmath19 ) , where @xmath17 is the average flux in the passband @xmath10 and @xmath19 is the continuum flux interpolated between the fluxes in the neighboring blue band centered at @xmath20 and the red band centered at @xmath21 .",
    "table 3 lists the measured indices along with emission line equivalent widths as a function of jd and @xmath7 .",
    "table 4 lists continuum magnitudes measured on spectrophotometric nights .",
    "we searched various databases for previous observations of bg gem .",
    "bg gem is not a known point source in any of the online _",
    "iras _ , radio , or x - ray catalogs ( e.g. , _ asca _ , _ rosat _ ) .",
    "it lies close to several triggers in the cgro / batse 4b catalog ( e.g. , trigger # 4157 ) , but large positional offsets from the nominal trigger positions makes association with these events unlikely .",
    "the average of 100 days of data from the all - sky monitor ( asm ) of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ is @xmath22 mcrab at 212 kev ( remillard 1999 ; 1 mcrab is 0.0755 counts s@xmath8 with the asm ( levine 1996 ) , which corresponds roughly to @xmath23 erg @xmath24 s@xmath8 at 212 kev assuming a spectrum similar to that other x - ray binaries [ see @xcite ] ) .",
    "bg gem is a 2mass point source , # 0603308 + 274150 in the 1999 spring release point source catalog , as summarized below .",
    "figure 2 shows light curves for bg gem .",
    "the data have been folded on the best period derived from fourier analysis and periodograms .",
    "the primary minimum has the ephemeris    @xmath25    we define @xmath7 = 0.0 at primary minima . the curves at 4050   and 4400   are derived from fast spectra .",
    "the zero points for the v and r data are set from fast light curves at 5550    and 6500    using offsets derived from the jacoby , hunter & christian ( 1984 ) spectral atlas and published broadband magnitudes , v = @xmath26 + 0.16 and r@xmath1 = @xmath27 .",
    "the zero point for the i@xmath1 light curve assumes the secondary is a normal k0 i star reddened by @xmath28 1.65 mag ( see below ) , with an intrinsic r@xmath1i@xmath1 = 0.52 ( bessell 1990 ) .",
    "the light curves show several clear features .",
    "ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star are prominent at vr@xmath1i@xmath1 .",
    "the large amplitudes of @xmath0 0.5 mag indicate that the secondary probably fills its roche lobe and that the orbital inclination is close to 90 .",
    "the deep primary minimum at short wavelengths shows that the primary star is much hotter than the secondary .",
    "the eclipse of the primary is long and flat - bottomed , which implies that the primary is extended .",
    "this extended primary is probably responsible for the eclipse of the secondary star visible in the v , r@xmath1 and i@xmath1 filters as a deep secondary minimum at @xmath7 = 0.5 .",
    "the absorption line indices shown in figure 3 provide additional support for a hot , extended , primary star in bg gem . due to a decrease in the continuum flux ,",
    "all of the lines are strongest during the eclipse of the primary .",
    "the blue lines strengthen much more than the red lines , indicating that the primary has a blue continuum .",
    "the eclipse of the primary covers a significant fraction , @xmath29 , of the orbital period .",
    "we can measure the spectral type of the secondary star by examining the absorption lines at @xmath7 = 0.0 , when the primary is in eclipse . based on a comparison of the spectral indices with indices derived from the jacoby ( 1984 ) and worthey ( 1994 ) spectral atlases ,",
    "all of the absorption lines imply a late g or early k spectral type .",
    "our best estimate is k0 i , with an uncertainty of 12 subclasses .",
    "the supergiant classification is required for the combination of strong mg  i , na  i , and fe  i absorption features .",
    "this result agrees with the low gravity implied for a lobe - filling secondary .",
    "the balmer emission line equivalent widths also vary with phase ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 lines are eclipsed at primary minimum .",
    "the eclipses are long and never reach totality .",
    "both lines strengthen relative to the continuum during secondary eclipses , because the flux from the k0  i secondary weakens considerably .",
    "similar variations may be visible in he  i @xmath106678 , but the line is weak with a typical equivalent width of 0.5   or less .",
    "other he  i lines are too difficult to measure accurately : @xmath105876 is blended with na  i and @xmath107065 is very weak .",
    "the light curves constrain the sizes of the h  ii emission region and the primary and secondary stars . for an edge - on system with a circular orbit , the eclipse duration yields the sum of the radii of the two components ; the duration of totality establishes the difference of the two radii . in bg gem ,",
    "the length of the eclipses at 4400   and 4050   results in @xmath30 0.37 @xmath31 , where @xmath31 is the orbital semi - major axis , @xmath32 is the radius of the primary star , and @xmath33 is the radius of the k0 i secondary star . from the length of totality , @xmath34 0.12 @xmath31 . these two constraints set @xmath35 0.12 @xmath31 and @xmath36 0.25 @xmath31 . the apparent length of totality at @xmath7 = 0.5 in the r@xmath1 and i@xmath1 filters suggests a somewhat larger radius for the primary at long wavelengths .",
    "the length of the h@xmath11 eclipse implies @xmath37 0.55 @xmath31 , which results in @xmath38 0.3 @xmath31 .",
    "the lack of a total eclipse for h@xmath11 confirms that the h  ii region is larger than the k0  i secondary .    to derive absolute constraints on the binary components , we need an independent measure of @xmath31 .",
    "we now consider radial velocity data to establish the orbital parameters of bg gem .",
    "we derived radial velocities from the strong absorption and emission lines on fast spectra .",
    "for absorption line velocities , we cross - correlated the fast spectra against the best - exposed spectrum , where the velocity is set by cross - correlation against standard stars with known velocities ( see tonry & davis 1979 ; kurtz & mink 1998 ) . to avoid contamination from the hot primary ,",
    "we restricted the cross - correlation to @xmath3950006800 .",
    "we measured emission line velocities from cross - correlations with an emission - line template , as described by kurtz & mink ( 1998 ) .",
    "we adopted the velocity of h@xmath12 as the emission line velocity , because h@xmath11 may be blended with [ n  ii ] emission on our low resolution spectra .",
    "we estimate errors of @xmath615   for absorption lines and @xmath620  for emission lines .",
    "table 5 lists the measured velocities as a function of jd and @xmath7 .",
    "figure 5 shows the absorption line radial velocities as a function of photometric phase .",
    "we analyzed these observations using monet s ( 1979 ) fourier transform algorithm ( see also kenyon & garcia 1986 ) .",
    "the best spectroscopic period , @xmath40 , agrees with the photometric period .",
    "a circular orbit with @xmath41 from equation ( 1 ) fits the orbit well .",
    "this solution has an orbital semi - amplitude , @xmath42 , and a fractional semi - major axis , @xmath43 au . spectroscopic conjunctions occur 1.234 days prior to photometric minima ,",
    "@xmath44    this phase difference has a significance of only 1.3@xmath5 .",
    "the mass function is @xmath45 .",
    "if we adopt sin @xmath46 = 1 , this result becomes @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the mass ratio .",
    "solutions with eccentric orbits do not improve the fit to the data . iterations in fourier and configuration space yield @xmath49 .",
    "the lucy & sweeney ( 1971 ) test confirms that the non - zero @xmath50 has only 1.5@xmath5 significance .",
    "we thus prefer the circular solution with the parameters quoted above .",
    "these results place a lower limit on the mass of the primary , @xmath51 4 , if the k0  i secondary has negligible mass and sin @xmath46 = 1 .",
    "the emission line velocities and double - peaked profiles indicate that the emission lines form in a circumstellar disk surrounding the primary star ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the h@xmath12 line has a nearly constant velocity outside primary eclipse , with a mean velocity of + 33.8 @xmath6 16.3 .",
    "this velocity is identical to the systemic velocity @xmath52 = 28.0 @xmath6 3.2 .",
    "the line velocity increases as the eclipse of the blue continuum begins .",
    "the velocity reaches @xmath53  at @xmath7 = @xmath160.05 to @xmath160.04 , decreases to the systemic velocity at @xmath7 = 0.00 , falls to @xmath54  at @xmath7 = 0.04 to 0.05 , and returns to the systemic velocity as the eclipse of the blue continuum ends .",
    "this classical disturbance  the rossiter effect  is consistent with the eclipse of a rapidly rotating disk .",
    "the blue - shifted half of the disk is eclipsed first during ingress and is revealed first during egress . both h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 decrease in full - width at half maximum during eclipse , supporting this interpretation .",
    "if we associate the apparent rotational velocity of @xmath0 125150  with disk rotation , the radius of the disk is @xmath38 3550 @xmath55 .",
    "together with our limit on @xmath56 from the eclipse duration , this result leads to a rough estimate for the mass ratio , @xmath57 0.1 , and the semi - major axis , @xmath58 150 .",
    "the small mass ratio supports our conclusion that the k0 supergiant fills its roche lobe .",
    "the effective radius of the roche lobe for @xmath59 is @xmath60 , indistinguishable from our estimate for the radius of the secondary , @xmath61 .",
    "the effective radius of the roche lobe for the primary star is @xmath62",
    "@xmath63 @xmath64 .",
    "the radius of the h@xmath11 emission region is thus roughly half of the tidal radius .",
    "the radius of the primary at blue wavelengths is only @xmath0 20% of the tidal radius , but large compared to the radius of a normal main sequence star .",
    "these results suggest a simple dynamical model for bg gem .",
    "the system consists of a lobe - filling k0 supergiant which transfers material into a large luminous accretion disk surrounding a primary star with @xmath65 45 .",
    "the disk must have a blue continuous spectrum to explain the deep primary eclipses at @xmath66 4500  .",
    "this disk is also responsible for the secondary eclipses at longer wavelengths .    to refine this model",
    ", we now consider the light curve and spectra in more detail .",
    "we begin with an analysis of the light curve using the wilson - devinney ( 1971 ) code .",
    "improved constraints on the orbital parameters and on the physical characteristics of the binary components lead to better limits on the nature of the accretion disk .",
    "we then use the reddening derived from the balmer lines and the optical continuum to set the distance to the system .",
    "wilson & devinney ( 1971 ) developed a modern light curve synthesis program to derive physical characteristics of binary stars from multi - color light curves .",
    "wilson ( 1990 , 1994 , and references therein ) describes recent improvements to the code , which is now available by anonymous ftp .",
    "the code consists of two programs : lc , used to compute model light curves or radial velocity curves as a function of various input parameters ; and dc , which can be iterated to derive the best set of binary parameters from a least squares fit of the model to actual observations .",
    "the analysis of  3.1 and  3.2 demonstrates that the primary component of bg gem is an extended disk surrounding a massive star .",
    "we view the system at close to 90 .",
    "few light curve synthesis programs include radiation from a disk ; none reliably compute fluxes for an edge - on disk .",
    "therefore , for this study , we used lc to derive reliable ranges for binary parameters that produce light curves similar to those in figures 24 , but omitted the iteration of these parameters with dc .",
    "figure 7 shows light curves from figure 2 along with model light curves . to determine the best fit binary system ( dashed curves ) , we varied several parameters to derive a ` best ' approximation to the observations , ( i ) the mass ratio , @xmath67 ; ( ii ) the inclination , @xmath46 ; and ( iii ) the brightness of the primary star relative to a lobe - filling secondary with an effective temperature , 4500 k , appropriate for a k0 supergiant star .",
    "the mass ratio and inclination set the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations ; the ellipsoidal amplitude grows with sin @xmath46 and inversely with @xmath67 .",
    "the relative brightness of the primary sets the depth of the primary eclipse and is also constrained by the variation of absorption line indices with wavelength .",
    "the dashed light curve models in figure 7 have several successes and failures .",
    "the models match the depth of primary eclipse at each wavelength and the overall amplitude and shape of the light curves at @xmath68 0.050.40 and @xmath68 0.600.95 .",
    "the length of the model eclipse at @xmath7 = 0 is too short , because the model primary is a star instead of a disk .",
    "the secondary minimum at @xmath7 = 0.5 is too shallow , because the small primary star can not eclipse very much of the lobe - filling k0 i secondary .",
    "the primary star must be hot and small to match the depths of primary eclipse at 40009000  .    to make a more realistic light curve synthesis , we considered a crude disk model for the primary star ( solid curves in figure 7 ) .",
    "we assumed a disk with a rectangular cross - section as viewed in the orbital plane .",
    "this disk has height @xmath69 above the orbital plane and radius @xmath70 in the orbital plane .",
    "we assumed @xmath70 = @xmath71 and @xmath69 = 0.050.1 @xmath70 , where @xmath72 is the effective radius of the roche lobe of the primary .",
    "we then took the output of lc  the fluxes of the primary and secondary as a function of @xmath7  and constructed new model light curves .",
    "we computed ( i ) the fraction of the disk eclipsed by the k0 secondary star at @xmath73 , and ( ii ) the fraction of the k0 secondary eclipsed by the disk at @xmath74 .",
    "we accurately accounted for roche geometry and assumed that both light sources are completely opaque and uniformly illuminated . this approach ignored limb and gravity darkening of the secondary , but should yield light curves closer to those actually observed .",
    "the simple disk - shaped primary can explain the depths and shape of both primary and secondary eclipses , as indicated by the solid lines in figure 7",
    ". models with @xmath69 = 0.07 @xmath70 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 0.80.9 yield the ` best ' fit to the data .",
    "less extended disks do not eclipse enough of the secondary at @xmath77 .",
    "more extended disks occult too much of the secondary .",
    "the large variation in disk radius with orbital phase suggests that the opaque , outer part of the disk is much cooler than the inner part of the disk .",
    "our model is too simple to constrain either the size of the disk as a function of wavelength or the brightness temperature distribution within the disk , as in vrielmann , horne , & hessman ( 1999 ) for example .",
    "we plan more detailed analyses in future studies .",
    "the models shown in figure 7 assume @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and a primary star with an effective temperature of 10,000 k. primary stars with different effective temperatures do not change the model light curves as long as the ratio of the luminosity of the primary star to the luminosity of the secondary star at each wavelength remains fixed .",
    "these ratios are set by the eclipse depth and can not vary by much more than 10% . for fixed inclination ,",
    "smaller mass ratios produce shallower secondary mimina .",
    "the disk radius also shrinks as @xmath67 increases , which leads to a smaller `` disk eclipse '' at secondary minimum .",
    "we estimate @xmath59 for sin @xmath46 = 1 . any geometry with @xmath80 80   does not produce a primary eclipse and is thus ruled out by the data .",
    "improved constraints on these values using our data requires a wd - type code that includes a reliable model for an edge - on accretion disk .      to derive better limits on the nature of the primary star , we need good estimates for the reddening and distance in addition to the parameters derived above . with @xmath81 and @xmath82 ,",
    "bg gem lies close to the galactic plane in the direction of the galactic anti - center .",
    "previous extinction surveys suggest modest visual extinctions , @xmath83 12 mag , for distances of 15 kpc ( e.g. , neckel & klare 1980 ; hakkila 1997 ) . adopting @xmath84 = 1.5 @xmath6 0.5 mag yields @xmath85 = 11.5 @xmath6 0.5 for the system at maximum and @xmath86 kpc for a k0 i star with @xmath87 = @xmath161.9 from the lc program and a bolometric correction of 1.5 mag .",
    "we can place better limits on the extinction from near - ir photometry and the emission line data .",
    "a k0 supergiant should have v ",
    "j = 1.51.6 and v  k = 2.12.3 . data from 2mass",

    "we thus favor @xmath88 for the extinction and @xmath91 kpc .",
    "this combination agrees with the distance - dependent extinction measurements summarized in hakkila ( 1997 ) .",
    "figure 8 shows the observed spectral energy distribution for bg gem .",
    "filled points indicate observations dereddened by @xmath92 .",
    "the k0 supergiant produces most of the optical and near - infrared radiation , as indicated by the solid and dot - dashed curves .",
    "the primary source contributes a modest fraction of the v light .",
    "its fraction of the total light grows substantially towards shorter wavelengths , as shown by the dashed curve .",
    "the slope of the hot continuum , @xmath11 = ( d log @xmath17/d log @xmath10 ) = @xmath93 , is best - fit by the spectrum of an accretion disk but is marginally consistent with the spectrum of an early type star .",
    "the measured extent of the primary , @xmath94 , is much larger than a normal early - type main sequence star .",
    "the predicted v magnitude of a spherical star with @xmath95 k and @xmath96 is roughly 23 mag _ brighter _ than the k0 secondary .",
    "our observed limit on the v brightness of the primary , @xmath0 10% of the k0 secondary , demonstrates that the primary is not a star .",
    "however , a flattened disk with @xmath97 0.050.10 satisfies the limits on @xmath32 and the total brightness derived from the light curves .",
    "constructing a ` best ' model for the disk in bg gem requires ultraviolet or x - ray data to provide better constraints on the spectrum and on the radius of the primary star . in this paper",
    ", we simply develop a model consistent with the observed spectrum and masses without considering whether it is ` best ' or unique .",
    "we first examine the case where the disk surrounds a hot primary star with parameters defined in  3.3 .",
    "the primary star either has a low luminosity compared to the disk or is occulted by the disk .",
    "otherwise , our model can not account for the primary eclipse as outlined above . requiring a self - luminous disk to produce all of the optical flux yields a large accretion rate , @xmath98 , which is ruled out by the weak h  i emission and lack of high ionization lines , such as he  ii @xmath104686 , on the optical spectrum",
    "( see kenyon & webbink 1984 ) .",
    "a ` reprocessing ' disk  which absorbs and reradiates light from the primary  can have a spectrum similar to a viscous accretion disk , because the temperature distributions are similar ( kenyon & hartmann 1987 ) . tests of several purely reprocessing disk models surrounding b - type stars indicate , however , that the half - light radius of the disk is @xmath0 10 , instead of the @xmath0 20  derived from the optical eclipses .",
    "we thus consider models where accretion and reprocessing contribute comparable amounts to the observed spectrum .    the light solid line in figure 8 plots the spectrum from an accretion disk that satisfies several observational constraints .",
    "the disk surrounds a b3 main sequence star . a large inclination , @xmath99 85 , allows the central star to hide behind the outer parts of the disk . the disk may also shield the k0 star from the radiation field of the b star .",
    "an accretion rate of a few @xmath100 provides roughly half of the observed continuum radiation .",
    "the model predicts a disk temperature @xmath101 k at a disk radius @xmath0 20  and a temperature @xmath0 3000 k at @xmath0 8090 .",
    "these results are consistent with eclipse data which require a small hot primary at short wavelengths and a larger , cooler primary at long wavelengths (  3.3 ) .",
    "cool material in the outer disk may also produce the extra mg  i absorption implied by the apparent rise in the mg  i index at secondary minimum ( fig .",
    "the uncertainties in this model are modest if we require the primary to lie on the main sequence .",
    "stars much cooler than @xmath0 15,000 k ( b6 v ) produce disks that are too cold to match the optical spectrum .",
    "stars much hotter than @xmath0 30,000 k ( b0 ) should produce substantial he  i emission ( from ionization of the disk ) that is not observed .",
    "this model has one main failure .",
    "it is difficult for a b3 star to produce enough photons to ionize h to the observed level .",
    "we estimate an extinction - corrected h@xmath12 luminosity of @xmath102 , which requires @xmath103 h - ionizing photons s@xmath8 if the b star ionizes material in the disk .",
    "this limit is 12 orders of magnitude larger than expected from a b3 v star .",
    "a boundary layer at the inner edge of the disk probably also produces too few ionizing photons , unless we have underestimated the accretion rate ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "olson ( 1991 ) considered h@xmath11 line formation within the disks of several algol systems , and produced line profiles similar to those observed .",
    "it may be possible to account for the line flux in a similar way , but such a calculation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is unlikely that any b - type star in bg gem could be underluminous compared to a normal main sequence star .",
    "main sequence stars accreting material from a disk are at least as luminous as non - accreting main sequence stars of the same mass ( e.g. , kippenhahn & meyer - hofmeister 1977 ) .",
    "the best alternative to this model is a black hole primary .",
    "although less likely than a b - type primary star , a black hole accreting at a small fraction of the eddington limit might account for the observed radiation at 20  ( depending on the geometry ) . to evaluate the plausibility of this model , we considered a disk surrounding a 4.5  black hole .",
    "the thick , inner disk produces a luminosity of @xmath104 if the accretion rate is 1% of the eddington limit .",
    "we naively assumed that the inner disk emits x - rays isotropically ; the outer disk absorbs and re - radiates this emission at the local blackbody temperature . for a steady - state disk where @xmath105 , the disk temperature at 420  is @xmath0 50008000 k. the predicted luminosity of the outer disk in this model , @xmath106 , is close to our estimated disk luminosity of 510  if the inclination is @xmath0 85 .",
    "our simple example suggests that a black hole accretion disk can plausibly produce the disk emission observed in bg gem for accretion rates much smaller than the eddington limit .",
    "the model optimistically assumes that the inner disk radiates efficiently , @xmath0 10% , compared to advection - dominated accretion flows ( e.g. , @xcite ) and that the outer disk radiates as a blackbody . despite this optimism , we note that esin ( 1997 ) derive optical luminosities , @xmath107 , of @xmath0 @xmath108@xmath109 erg s@xmath8 for quiescent disks and @xmath109@xmath110 erg s@xmath8 for low state disks in black hole binaries with inclinations of 6090 .",
    "the compact disks assumed in the esin models are more than factor of 100 smaller than the disk in bg gem , so it may be possible to achieve the observed optical flux from a larger disk surrounding a black hole in a wider binary system .",
    "the black hole model has one main advantage and one main disadvantage compared to models where the primary is a b - type main sequence star .",
    "a black hole accreting at 1% of the eddington limit easily produces enough high energy photons to satisfy our constraints on the h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 fluxes unless the accretion efficiency is much less than 1% ( esin 1997 ) .",
    "but , hiding an accreting black hole in an edge - on binary may be more difficult than hiding a b - type main sequence star .",
    "the x - ray luminosity , @xmath0 1300 , needed to power the observed optical luminosity in bg gem is roughly 3 orders of magnitude larger than the upper limit derived from the asm observations , @xmath0 2 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of quiescent black hole binary systems are also low , @xmath111 ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". however , the region that emits x - rays in a black hole binary is very small , @xmath112 to @xmath113 cm , and easily occulted when the binary is viewed at high inclination .",
    "for example , esin ( 1997 ) show that the x - ray luminosity of the small disk in an edge - on black hole binary system is several orders of magnitude smaller than the same disk viewed pole - on .",
    "we expect that the larger disk in bg gem can occult a larger fraction of the x - ray flux than an edge - on disk in a smaller binary system .",
    "future calculations of black hole binaries should address this issue .",
    "our results indicate that bg gem is a textbook example of a very evolved , semi - detached binary system .",
    "the system consists of a low mass , lobe - filling k0 supergiant which transfers material into a disk surrounding a massive primary star .",
    "the large ellipsoidal light variations of the k0 secondary indicate a large mass ratio , @xmath114 0.1 , and large orbital inclination , @xmath115 .",
    "the radial velocities of h@xmath11 emission in the disk support the large mass ratio .",
    "we prefer @xmath116 to allow the disk to occult the primary star , which is not visible in the optical .",
    "the system is remarkably stable for an interacting binary .",
    "there is little scatter in either the optical brightness ( for 25 orbital cycles ) or the emission line equivalent widths ( for 34 orbital cycles ) .",
    "studies of archival plate material would place useful constraints on long - term variability and outburst frequency .",
    "our data are insufficient to choose between the two possible alternatives for the primary star .",
    "the optical spectra resemble spectra of several algol systems  e.g. , uu cnc ( p = 96.7 days , @xcite ) and rz oph ( p = 262 days , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )  as well as quiescent spectra of several black hole binaries ",
    "e.g. , v616 mon ( p = 0.32 days , @xcite and references therein ) and v404 cyg ( p = 6.5 days , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "none of the long - period algol binaries have as extreme mass ratios as in bg gem ( see @xcite ) , although rz oph has @xmath117 .",
    "the structure of the binary in rz oph has several other features in common with bg gem , including a lobe - filling k - type star , an invisible primary , and an extended accretion disk that occults the secondary star at @xmath7 = 0.5 ( see olson 1987 ) .",
    "however , most of the energy from the disk in rz oph is produced by accretion , because the disk in rz oph is brighter and less stable than the disk in bg gem .",
    "producing a large h@xmath11 flux from the intrinsically less luminous disk in bg gem is also a challenge , as noted above .",
    "bg gem has many features in common with quiescent black hole binaries , despite the 12 order of magnitude difference in orbital periods .",
    "many black hole binaries have ellipsoidal light curves and extreme mass ratios similar to those in bg gem ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "quiescent black hole binaries often have modest emission line spectra , with strong , double - peaked h  i lines and weaker , double - peaked he  i lines ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "higher ionization emission lines , such as he ii @xmath104686 , appear only in outburst , when the accretion rate through the disk increases dramatically .",
    "quiescent black hole binaries often escape detection as very intense x - ray sources until they undergo major eruptions , and they often remain in quiescence for decades ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "all of the currently known black hole binary systems have small orbital inclinations @xmath118 ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath116 derived here for bg gem may allow the disk to occult even an intense x - ray source ( see @xcite , 1999b , and references therein for typical outburst fluxes ) . despite the lack of x - rays , bg gem may still contain a black hole primary surrounded by a quiescent accretion disk .    if confirmed , bg gem would be the black hole binary with the longest known orbital period .",
    "other black hole binaries have periods of a few days or less .",
    "any black hole binary is a challenge to modern theories of the evolution of binary systems ( e.g. , kalogera 1999 ) .",
    "bg gem would provide a severe test of these theories .",
    "bg gem would also be the only eclipsing system known among black hole binaries .",
    "the black hole mass is unambiguous in an eclipsing binary .",
    "our limit for the primary mass is close to the maximum possible neutron star mass ( see , for example , burrows 1998 ) .",
    "bg gem thus may place new constraints on the minimum black hole mass .    with these considerations in mind ,",
    "it is clear that additional observations are needed to understand the nature of the primary in bg gem .",
    "ultraviolet spectra at 10003000   would probe the continuum and emission lines produced in the inner portions of the accretion disk and might reveal stellar absorption lines if the primary is a b - type star .",
    "better limits on the x - ray flux from instruments on board _ chandra _ and the _ x - ray multi - mirror _ would also provide better constraints on the nature of the primary .",
    "detection of an x - ray source that is eclipsed at primary minima would favor a black hole primary , because b - type main sequence stars are weak x - ray sources .",
    "whatever the nature of the primary , future studies of the secondary star and the accretion disk surrounding the primary should yield a better understanding of accretion in wide binary systems .",
    "eclipses of the blue continuum and the emission lines provide useful information about disk structure , through maximum entropy reconstruction among other techniques .",
    "higher resolution observations of mg  i and other absorption features probe conditions in the secondary star as well as the cool , outer portions of the disk . near - infrared observations covering the orbit would improve mass estimates for the secondary star derived from ellipsoidal variations and might reveal emission from an optically thick `` bright spot , '' where material lost by the k0 supergiant impacts the disk .",
    "emission from an optically thin spot might be visible in h@xmath11 or h@xmath12 .",
    "finally , high resolution observations might yield a radial velocity curve for the primary and improved estimates for the mass ratio . the small distance and reddening make bg gem a prime target for these and other observations of a binary system at an interesting phase of its evolution .",
