    "over the past few years , cellular and wireless networks have been challenged by the increasing number of mobile internet services and the constant growth of mobile data traffic .",
    "future radio access networks should provide reduced latency , improved energy efficiency , and high user data rates in dense and high mobility network environments .",
    "the architecture of future communication networks will be heterogeneous in nature , i.e. macrocell with many small cells",
    ". the great challenge will be the employment of novel interference management strategies that will manage interference , without increasing the system s overhead , and provide high data rates and reliable transmissions .",
    "interference alignment ( ia ) was introduced by maddah - ali et al . in @xcite , and jafar and shamai in @xcite for the mimo x channels , and by cadambe and jafar in @xcite for the @xmath0-user interference channel , where @xmath1 degrees of freedom ( dof ) can be achieved .",
    "ia aligns the interfering signals present at each receiver into a low dimensional subspace , by linearly encoding signals in multiple dimensions , resulting in the desired signal being in a dimension unoccupied by interference links .",
    "initially , ia required global channel state information ( csi ) and was computationally complex .    further work on ia led to the scheme of blind ia , presented by wang , gou and jafar in @xcite and jafar in @xcite , for certain network scenarios , which can achieve full dof in the absence of csi at the transmitters ( csit ) , thus reducing the system overhead . furthermore ,",
    "blind ia was introduced , by jafar in @xcite , for cellular and heterogeneous networks , by `` seeing '' frequency reuse ( i.e. orthogonal allocation of signaling dimensions ) as a simple form of interference alignment .",
    "blind ia in heterogeneous networks was generalized in @xcite for the case of @xmath0 users in the macrocell and @xmath0 femtocells with one user each , introducing kronecker ( tensor ) product representation and a variation of model parameters to optimize the sum rate performance .",
    "a special case of blind ia , known as topological interference management ( tim ) , was introduced by jafar in @xcite .",
    "tim takes into consideration the position of every user in the cell(s ) , and based on their channel strength , weak interference links are ignored , resulting in @xmath2 dof achieved for every user in the siso broadcast channel ( bc ) . in @xcite , sun and jafar",
    "research the scheme of tim for the case of multiple receive and transmit antennas , concluding that only the former can provide more dof in the network .    unlike orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) and single - carrier frequency division multiple access ( sc - fdma ) currently employed in 4 g mobile networks , the scheme of non - orthogonal multiple access ( noma ) , proposed in @xcite by saito et al .",
    ", is based on a non - orthogonal approach to future radio access .",
    "according to noma , multiple users are superimposed in the power domain at the transmitters , and successive interference cancellation ( sic ) is performed at the receivers , improving capacity and throughput performance .",
    "power allocation and quality - of - service ( qos ) for edge - cell users , has been a major issue to tackle in systems employing noma .",
    "it has been shown , in @xcite , that for the bc , if noma is employed with the aid of coordinated multiple point ( comp ) and _ _ alamouti code , satisfactory rates for edge - cell users can be achieved without degrading the performance of users closer to the base station . moreover , with an adaptive power and frequency resource allocation algorithm , as proposed in @xcite , targeting inter - cell interference , in order to boost the total throughput , reliable transmissions to edge - cell users can be obtained .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , authors study two different power allocation schemes , a fixed one and a cognitive radio inspired one , in a mimo - noma model by using signal alignment and stochastic geometry",
    ".    recently , research on noma has been focusing on user pairing to reduce complexity and improve efficiency .",
    "cooperative noma schemes , where users with higher channel gains have prior information about other users messages , have been developed @xcite .",
    "user pairing has been introduced in two noma schemes , discussed in @xcite , with one scheme employing fixed power allocation ( f - noma ) and another one inspired by cognitive radio ( cr - noma ) , with users grouped differently in each one of the two noma schemes .",
    "in addition , user pairing has been studied in conjunction with the problem of power allocation , in @xcite , based on a new design of precoding and detection matrices .",
    "user pairing and the performance of noma have been also studied from an information theory perspective , as discussed in @xcite , researching the relationship between the rate region achieved by noma and the capacity region of the bc , observing that different power allocation to users corresponds to different points on the rate region graph , and showing that noma can outperform tdma not only in terms of the sum rate , but for every users s rate as well .    from the schemes of tim and noma , a hybrid tim - noma scheme emerged , introduced in @xcite for the siso bc and in @xcite for the mimo bc .",
    "the hybrid tim - noma scheme divides users into groups , and manages `` inter - group '' interference based on the principles of tim , and `` intra - group '' interference based on noma .",
    "the hybrid scheme can achieve double the sum rate of tdma for high snr values .    in this paper , based on @xcite , we introduce two interference management schemes employed in heterogeneous networks . for both schemes",
    ", we consider a @xmath0-user macrocell and @xmath3 femtocells with one user each , taking into consideration the position of every user in the cell .",
    "the first scheme is a hybrid tim - noma scheme based on @xcite .",
    "the novelty of this scheme is the fact that it changes the way user - grouping is performed compared to @xcite .",
    "users in the macrocell belong to one group and then there exist @xmath4 groups of femtocells .",
    "inter - cell interference is managed based on tim and intra - cell interference based on noma .",
    "the second scheme is blind ia in heterogeneous networks , which constitutes further work on @xcite .",
    "our contribution is the additional consideration of interference caused to femtocells by transmissions in the macrocell , and the existence of more than one femtocells around a macrocell user .",
    "the algorithms of both schemes are described by using kronecker ( tensor ) product representation . based on our results",
    ", the hybrid scheme can achieve more total dof compared to tdma , whereas blind ia outperforms tdma in terms of dof in most cases .",
    "we show that both schemes achieve higher sum rates than tdma , as depicted in figure [ fig : journal1 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 ] .",
    "finally , comparing the two schemes , blind ia provides better sum - rate and ber performance to macrocell users , whereas the hybrid scheme results in better performance for the users in the femtocells , and based on its power allocation scheme provides qos to edge cell users .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the general network architecture , and the example - model which is used to describe the two schemes .",
    "sections 3 and 4 present the model description and achievable sum rate of the hybrid and blind ia schemes respectively .",
    "section 5 describes the special case of blind ia when @xmath5 , i.e. only one femtocell interferes with every user in the macrocell .",
    "section 6 discusses our results and the performance of the two schemes in terms of dof , ber and sum rate .",

    "<S> future multi - tier communication networks will require enhanced network capacity and reduced overhead . in the absence of channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitters , blind interference alignment ( bia ) and topological interference management ( tim ) can achieve optimal degrees of freedom ( dof ) , minimizing network s overhead . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , non - orthogonal multiple access ( noma ) can increase the sum rate of the network , compared to orthogonal radio access techniques currently adopted by 4 g networks . </S>",
    "<S> our contribution is two interference management schemes , bia and a hybrid tim - noma scheme , employed in heterogeneous networks by applying user - pairing and kornecker product representation . </S>",
    "<S> bia manages inter- and intra - cell interference by antenna selection and appropriate message scheduling . </S>",
    "<S> the hybrid scheme manages intra - cell interference based on noma and inter - cell interference based on tim . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both schemes achieve at least double the rate of tdma . </S>",
    "<S> the hybrid scheme always outperforms tdma and bia in terms of degrees of freedom ( dof ) . comparing the two proposed schemes , </S>",
    "<S> bia achieves more dof than tdma under certain restrictions , and provides better bit - error - rate ( ber ) and sum rate perfomance to macrocell users , whereas the hybrid scheme improves the performance of femtocell users . </S>"
