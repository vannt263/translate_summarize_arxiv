    "in the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena , it is extremely important to understand finite - size corrections to thermodynamical quantities . in experiments and in numerical studies of model systems",
    ", it is essential to take into account finite size effects in order to extract correct infinite - volume predictions from the data .",
    "finite - size scaling @xcite concerns the critical behavior of systems in which one or more directions are finite , even though microscopically large and is valuable in the analysis of experimental and numerical data in many situations , for example , for films of finite thickness .",
    "as soon as one has a finite system one must consider the question of boundary conditions on the outer surfaces or `` walls '' of the system .",
    "the systems under various boundary conditions have the same per - site free energy , internal energy , specific heat , etc , in the bulk limit , whereas the finite size corrections are different . to understand the effects of boundary conditions on finite - size scaling and finite - size corrections , it is valuable to study model systems , such as percolation model @xcite and the ising model @xcite .",
    "therefore , in recent decades there have many investigations on finite - size scaling , finite - size corrections , and boundary effects for critical model systems @xcite .",
    "of particular importance in such studies are exact results where the analysis can be carried out without numerical errors .",
    "the ising model has exact solutions on finite lattices with many kinds of boundary conditions , including cylindrical @xcite , toroidal @xcite , and mobius strip and klein bottle @xcite .",
    "this class also includes the special boundary conditions introduced by brascamp and kunz @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the exact partition function of the two - dimensional ising model in the zero field wrapped on the cylinder was performed by onsager in 1944 @xcite . exploiting the exactly known partition function of the two dimensional ising model on finite @xmath6 square lattice with toroidal boundary conditions",
    "@xcite , ferdinand and fisher @xcite computed the finite - size corrections to the free energy , the internal energy , and the specific heat up to order @xmath7 .",
    "recently , there has been much effort in understanding the behavior of finite - size corrections of the free energy , internal energy and specific heat .",
    "izmailian and hu @xcite and salas @xcite extended the results of @xcite for the free energy and the internal energy up to order @xmath8 and for the specific heat up to order @xmath9 .",

    "very recently , ivashkevich , izmailian and hu @xcite provided a systematic method to compute finite - size corrections to the partition function and their derivatives of the ising model on torus .",
    "their approach is based on an intimate relation between the terms of the asymptotic expansion and the so - called kronecker s",
    "double series @xcite which are directly related to elliptic theta functions .",
    "expressing the final result in terms of theta functions avoids messy sums ( as in some earlier works ) and greatly simplifies the task of verifying the behavior of the different terms in the asymptotic expansion under duality transformation @xmath12 . using this approach ,",

    "we find that when the ratio @xmath3 is smaller than 1 the behaviors of finite - size corrections for @xmath1 are quite different for bk and toroidal boundary conditions ; when @xmath4 is larger than 3 , finite - size corrections for @xmath1 in two boundary conditions approach the same values . in the limit @xmath5",
    "we obtain the expansion of the free energy for infinitely long strip with bk boundary conditions .",
