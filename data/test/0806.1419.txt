    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are systems in which a low - mass companion star transfers material onto a neutron star or black hole .",
    "most of the systems have orbital periods of between a few hours to days and contain ordinary hydrogen - rich donor stars .",
    "while these systems have minimum orbital periods around 80 mins , systems with hydrogen - poor or degenerate donor stars can , however , systems with hydrogen - poor or degenerate donor stars can evolve to extremely small binary separations with orbital periods as short as a few minutes @xcite .",
    "such systems are called ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ) and have a range in orbital periods from 11 to 50 minutes ( see @xcite )    finding ucxbs is difficult because measuring orbital periods ( p@xmath0 ) is generally difficult in lmxbs .",
    "the current known sample consists of 27 systems , 8 with known periods , 4 with tentative periods and 15 candidate systems @xcite .",
    "the identification of ucxbs is mostly done through measuring p@xmath0  via ( 1 ) timing of doppler - delayed pulses if the accretor is a pulsar ; ( 2 ) measuring periodic x - ray eclipses / dips if the binary inclination is high enough and ( 3 ) through the measurement of periodic modulations resulting from x - ray heating of the inner side of the donor star or from the superhump phenomenon that is predicted for extreme mass ratio systems .",
    "there are also two indirect methods to identify ucxbs without measuring p@xmath0 , which depend on the fact that in an ucxb the accretion disk are relatively small ; ( 1 ) for the same x - ray flux , @xmath1 is about 4 mags fainter for ucxbs than for normal lmxbs and ( 2 ) a method which depends on the critical accretion rate below which a system becomes transient ; if the persistent accretion luminosity is 1% of eddington @xcite    4u0614 + 091  is a low luminosity x - ray binary .",
    "thermonuclear type i x - ray bursts were observed by _",
    "oso-8 _ @xcite and the the compact object is a neutron star . historically , 4u0614 + 091  has been associated with the brightest x - ray bursts .",
    "based on the detection of a bright burst with _ watch _ , and eddington limit arguments , @xcite argue that the distance to 4u0614 + 091  is probably @xmath23kpc .",
    "several lines of evidence point to the conclusion that 4u0614 + 091is an ucxb . based on the comparison of the enhanced neon to oxygen ratio to known ucxbs , @xcite argue that 4u0614 + 091  is also a ucxb .",
    "further support is provided by optical spectroscopy , which has revealed carbon and oxygen emission lines , but no evidence for hydrogen or helium @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart to 4u0614 + 091 , v1055ori , is also intrinsically faint ( @xmath3=18.5 ) .",
    "the faintness of its persistent x - ray emission and nearby distance suggest a low accretion rate , which is consistent with an orbital period @xmath21hr @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the results on a long term campaign to find a stable period in 4u0614 + 091 , which would most likely represent the orbital period .",
    "our optical photometric observations were taken in 2006 and 2007 using the 80 cm iac80 telescope ( izana , spain ) , the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ; la palma , spain ) and the 1.5 telescope at san pedro martin ( spm ; mexico ) .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table[log ] .",
    "v - band images were taken using exposure times ranging from 40sec to 200sec depending on the seeing , weather conditions and the aperture of the telescope being used .",
    "bias images and dome flat fields were also taken for calibration purposes .",
    "standard stars could not be taken due to non - photometric weather conditions .",
    "we used iraf for our data reduction , which included bias subtraction using bias images or the overscan regions of the ccd , and flat - fielding using sky flat fields taken during twilight .",
    "the ultracam reduction pipeline software @xcite was then used to obtain lightcurves for 4u0614 + 091  and several comparison stars by extracting the counts using aperture photometry . a variable aperture which scaled with the seeing",
    "differential lightcurves were then obtained by computing the count ratio of 4u0614 + 091  with respect to a local standard ( the same non - variable star for each dataset ) . as a check of the photometry and systematics in the reduction procedure , we also extracted lightcurves of a comparison star similar in brightness to the target .",
    "the photometric accuracy of 4u0614 + 091  for each exposure is about 2 percent and agrees with the scatter of the comparison star with similar brightness .",
    "figure1 shows the lightcurve for 4u0614 + 091  obtained from each observing site .",
    "the data clearly exhibits a periodic modulation , which changes strength with time .",
    "to search for periodic / quasi - periodic modulations we use the method of lomb - scargle @xcite to compute the periodograms of all the datasets , using the constraints imposed by the nyquist frequency and the typical duration of each observation .",
    "the results are shown in figure2 .",
    "we also show the 99 percent confidence level , which allows us to demonstrate the significance of the peaks detected in the lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "the level was calculated from a monte carlo simulation , which using 10,000 sets of gaussian noise with mean and variance taken from the dataset .",
    "the periodogram for each datasets shows many peaks significant at the 99 percent level .",
    "the strongest peak in the the iac80 data is at 51.3mins , whereas the not data shows a weaker peak at 64.1mins , and the spm data shows an even weaker modulation at 42mins .",
    "the semi - amplitudes of the modulation is 4.6mmags , 2,6mmags and 1.3mmags for the iac80 , spm and not data respectively .",
    "we have looked at the rxte asm lightcurves and the x - ray flux seems to be similar on the dates of our optical observations .",
    "@xcite obtained vlt optical spectra of 4u0614 + 091  and identified features of relatively low ionisation states of carbon and oxygen .",
    "this clearly identifies 4u0614 + 091  as an ucxb and suggests that the donor in the system in a carbon - oxygen white dwarf . for 4u0614 + 091  and 4u1626 - 67",
    "there are clear indications that the discs are dominated by c and o. @xcite have also obtained vlt spectra and compared them with detailed nlte models for spectra of ucxbs . unfortunately , the ntle models do not sufficiently agree with the observed spectra for quantitative abundance analysis .",
    "although simple lte models seem to fit the data better , they also can not be used for quantitative measurements because nlte effects mainly due to x - ray irradiation , need to be taken into account .",
    "we have found several sinusoidal modulation in the optical lightcurve of 4u0614 + 091 .",
    "these modulations most likely arise from either x - ray irradiation of the inner face of the secondary star and/or a superhump modulation from the accretion disc , or quasi - periodic oscillations in the accretion disc .",
    "this is not surprising as ucxbs are known to show orbital modulations as well as qpos .",
    "e.g. strong 15 minute optical / uv quasi - periodic oscillations were previously detected in the 42min ucxb 4u162667 @xcite , showing that photometric variability in an ucxb need not only occur near the orbital period .",
    "@xcite have reported a 50min periodicity in their high - speed optical data taken with ultracam .",
    "time - resolved vlt spectroscopy also shows some evidience , although marginal , for a 49min periodicity in the weak absorption line near 4960  @xcite .",
    "the strongest period we detect is at 51.3mins and is present in the iac80 data .",
    "this may reflect the superhump period , slightly longer than the orbital period .",
    "however , only observations long enough to contain many modulation cycles can distinguish between a periodic and a quasi - periodic modulation and allow a secure measurement of the orbital period .",
