    "in this paper we construct a generalized universal cover for a very large class of uniform spaces called _ coverable _ spaces , which includes all geodesic metric spaces ( corollary [ inner ] ) , connected and locally pathwise connected compact topological spaces ( corollary [ 0628new ] ) , and in particular peano continua ( corollary [ peano ] ) .",
    "coverable spaces also include some more pathological spaces like the topologist s sine curve ( see below ) and totally disconnected spaces ( @xcite ) .",
    "associated with this generalized universal cover is a functorial uniform space invariant called the _ deck group _ , which is related to the classical fundamental group by a natural homomorphism .",
    "three types of uniform spaces are of greatest importance : topological groups , compact topologial spaces and metric spaces .",
    "topological groups were considered in @xcite and @xcite ; the relationship to the present paper may be found in section [ topsec ] , along with a correction to bptg . for compact topological spaces , which have a unique uniform structure compatible with the topology , the deck group is a topological invariant that coincides with the fundamental group in the setting of what we will call poincar spaces ( i.e. , connected , locally pathwise connected , semilocally simply connected spaces ) .",
    "the special case of metric spaces is of particular interest .",
    "in addition to more classical examples such as the hawaiian earring and related spaces ( @xcite , @xcite , de , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , generalized universal covers and fundamental groups have recently been studied in connection with gromov - hausdorff limits of riemannian manifolds ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "such limits are always geodesic spaces , and hence coverable .",
    "a recent example of menguy shows that limits of riemannian manifolds with positive ricci curvature can have bad local topology ( @xcite)precisely the sort of metric spaces at which the present work is aimed .",
    "we will consider metric spaces in more detail in an upcoming paper .",
    "one of the main impediments to generalizing the classical construction of the universal cover is the traditional definition of covering map , the most important property of which is the ability to lift curves and homotopies .",
    "however , this lifting property is traditionally gained at the expense of requiring that a space and its cover be locally homeomorphic in a fairly strong way , and consequently traditional universal ( or simply connected ) covers exist _ only _ for poincar spaces .",
    "earlier work concerning systems coverings of uniform spaces ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) was also limited by considering only traditional covers , and therefore a universal object is impossible to obtain even for basic examples such as the countable product of circles or the hawaiian earring .    one may take a hint from topological groups for how to proceed . in this category , a traditional covering map is a quotient homomophism with discrete kernel .",
    "the action by the kernel is not only properly discontinuous , it is uniformly so .",
    "moreover , as we showed in @xcite , one can exploit this more uniform kind of action to define generalized covers as quotients with central kernels that are ( complete and ) prodiscrete , i.e. are inverse limits of discrete groups .",
    "these generalized covers have the lifting properties of traditional covers , but are not in general local homeomorphisms .",
    "this allows one to abandon assumptions concerning ( semi-)local simple connectivity . the kernel of the generalized universal cover is a kind of generalized fundamental group .",
    "the key to generalizing the results of @xcite is to build a group action right into the definition of generalized cover .",
    "actually doing so is , unfortunately , somewhat technical , and this was carried out by the second author in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to consider a kind of uniformly  properly discontinuous action called a _",
    "discrete action _  on a uniform space .",
    "inverse systems of discrete actions define _ prodiscrete actions _  that generalize the notion of the action on a topological group via a prodiscrete , central subgroup .",
    "the action by a subgroup also preserves the uniform structure ( as long as one matches the left or right action to the left or right uniformity ) ; this property is generalized by something called an isomorphic  action on a uniform structure , which also broadens the notion of an isometric action on a metric space . a generalized _ cover _ of uniform spaces",
    "is defined in @xcite to be a quotient via a prodiscrete , isomorphic action . at the beginning of @xcite",
    "is a review of basic definitions and properties of uniform spaces that are used for the construction ; we will use the same notation in this paper ( see @xcite for a more in - depth discussion ) .",
    "what follows is a sketch of our construction and main results .",
    "all of these constructions involve a choice of basepoint(s ) , but basepoint choice has an impact in this setting similar to that in the traditional setting for pathwise connected spaces , and for simplicity we will save detailed discussion of basepoints for the body of the paper . for now , all functions are simply assumed to preserve some chosen basepoints ( this is particularly important for the uniqueness statements , which are only true up to choice of basepoint ) .    for each uniform space @xmath0",
    "there is an inverse system @xmath1 indexed on the collection of entourages of @xmath0 partially ordered by reverse inclusion , called the _",
    "fundamental inverse system _ of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath2 consists of equivalence classes of finite @xmath3-chains starting at a fixed basepoint .",
    "an @xmath3-_chain _ between points @xmath4 is an ordered set of points @xmath5 such that for all @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "an @xmath3__-loop _ _ is an @xmath3-chain that starts and ends at the same point .",
    "two @xmath3-chains from @xmath8 to @xmath9 are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other through finitely many steps , each of which involves removing or adding a point , always leaving the endpoints fixed and keeping an @xmath3-chain at each stage .",
    "the collection of all equivalence classes of @xmath3-loops at the basepoint forms a group @xmath10 with respect to concatenation .",
    "this group is finitely generated when @xmath0 is compact ( theorem [ compact ] ) .",
    "when @xmath2 is provided with a natural lifted  uniformity , @xmath10 acts discretely on @xmath11 by concatenating an @xmath3-loop at the beginning of an @xmath3-chain . in a sense @xmath12",
    "detects holes  in @xmath0 that are , roughly speaking , larger than @xmath3 .",
    "the restriction @xmath13 of the bonding map @xmath14 to @xmath15 preserves concatenation and produces another inverse system @xmath16 of groups and homomorphisms ; in fact these two systems form an inverse system of actions as defined in @xcite .",
    "the inverse limit of the group system consists of a group @xmath17 , called the _ deck group _ of @xmath0 , which acts prodiscretely and isomorphically on @xmath18 .",
    "observe that @xmath19 is actually a ( prodiscrete ) topological group and the homomorphisms induced on the deck group are continuous homomorphisms .",
    "however , we do not know of examples of spaces having deck groups that are abstractly , but not continuously , isomorphic .",
    "in general the projection @xmath20 may not be surjective , and hence not a cover .",
    "in fact @xmath21 may be only a single point even when @xmath0 is not .",
    "the next definition , which is central to the paper , deals with this issue .",
    "[ coverdef]let @xmath0 be a uniform space .",
    "an entourage @xmath3 such that the projection @xmath22 is surjective is called a covering entourage .",
    "a uniform space @xmath0 is called coverable if there is a uniformity base of covering entourages including @xmath23 .",
    "the collection of all such entourages is called the covering base @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath0 is coverable then each @xmath25 is a covering map ( in the sense of @xcite ) and we refer to the projection @xmath20 as the _ universal cover of _ @xmath0 .",
    "the next theorem combines results of theorems [ 73 ] and [ 101 ] .",
    "( induced mapping ) let @xmath26 be coverable spaces with universal covers @xmath27 and @xmath28 . if @xmath29 is uniformly continuous then there is a unique uniformly continuous function @xmath30 such that @xmath31 . moreover ,    1 .",
    "if @xmath32 is a cover then @xmath33 is a uniform homeomorphism .",
    "if @xmath34 is a coverable space and @xmath35 is uniformly continuous then @xmath36 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath33 to @xmath19 in the above theorem is a homomorphism @xmath37 ( theorem [ 73 ] ) .",
    "therefore the deck group is a functorial invariant of uniform structures . in the case of compact spaces",
    "the deck group is a topological invariant ; if @xmath0 is a compact poincar space then the deck group is naturally isomorphic to the fundamental group ( corollary 0518equiv ) . for non - compact spaces",
    "the deck group need not be a topological invariant ; for example the surface of revolution @xmath38 obtained by rotating the graph of @xmath39 about the @xmath40-axis has trivial deck group even though it is homeomorphic to a standard cylinder  the deck group of which is @xmath41 .",
    "the problem is that a generator of @xmath42 may be represented by a path that extends down the cusp arbitrarily far , wraps around the small cusp , and then travels back to the basepoint .",
    "this generator will therefore not be detected by any of the groups @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the metric entourage of size @xmath45 .",
    "the deck group does indicate that the standard cylinder and @xmath38 are not _ uniformly _ homeomorphic and that @xmath38 is not uniformly semilocally simply connected .",
    "the next theorem follows from corollary [ partialstep ] and theorem [ 101 ] .",
    "( universal property ) if @xmath0 and @xmath46 are coverable and @xmath47 is a cover then there is a unique cover @xmath48 such that @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the universal cover of @xmath46 .    with regard to the universal property",
    "it should be pointed out that , in contrast to the situation for coverable topological groups , we do not know whether the composition of covers between coverable spaces ( or uniform spaces in general ) is a cover .",
    "( the situation for topological groups is significantly simpler because the deck group is actually a central subgroup of the universal cover and covers are simply quotient homomorphisms , making their composition easier to understand . )",
    "recall that the composition of traditional covering maps between connected topological spaces need not be a traditional cover ( @xcite ) .",
    "we resolve this problem in the same way that it is resolved for topological spaces ( see @xcite ) : define a category whose objects are covers @xmath51 between coverable uniform spaces and whose morphisms are commutative diagrams @xmath52where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are covers and @xmath32 is uniformly continuous .",
    "it is an immediate consequence of the preceding theorem that the universal cover @xmath55 is a universal object in this category .",
    "[ universaldef]a uniform space @xmath0 is called universal if there is a base @xmath56 for the uniformity such that for any @xmath57 , @xmath58 is a uniform homeomorphism .",
    "the collection of all such uniformities is called the universal base of @xmath0 ( which always contains @xmath23 ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is coverable then @xmath21 is universal ( theorem [ xic ] ) and every universal space is coverable ( corollary [ uic ] ) .",
    "moreover , a coverable space @xmath46 is universal if and only if @xmath19 is trivial , or equivalently every @xmath3-loop is @xmath3-homotopic to the trivial loop for entourages @xmath3 in a particular basis ( corollary [ uit ] ) , a condition that is reminiscent of simply connected .",
    "the next theorem follows from theorem [ 76 ] .",
    "( lifting ) let @xmath0 be universal , @xmath46 be coverable and @xmath47 be uniformly continuous .",
    "then there exists a unique uniformly continuous function @xmath59 such that @xmath60 , where @xmath50 is the universal cover of @xmath46 .",
    "any connected , uniformly locally pathwise connected ( see definition unidef ) , simply connected uniform space is universal  in particular any compact , connected , locally pathwise connected , simply connected topological space is universal ( theorem [ 0627simply ] and corollary [ compactu ] ) .",
    "therefore we may apply the lifting theorem to paths and homotopies of paths .",
    "this allows one to define a natural mapping @xmath61 , for any coverable space @xmath0 , by lifting a loop that represents an element of the fundamental group and taking the deck transformation that takes the basepoint to the endpoint of the loop . even though the action is not discrete this mapping is well defined , and a homomorphism .",
    "there is a satisfying relationship between the two most basic algebraic properties of the map @xmath62 and topological properties of @xmath63 when @xmath0 is pathwise connected : ( 1 ) @xmath62 is injective if and only if @xmath21 is simply connected ( proposition [ inj ] ) , and ( 2 ) @xmath64 is surjective if and only if @xmath21 is pathwise connected .",
    "more precisely , for arbitrary coverable @xmath0 , the image of @xmath64 is the stabilizer in the deck group @xmath19 of the pathwise connected component of @xmath21 that contains the basepoint ( theorem [ nat ] ) . hence if @xmath21 is both pathwise connected and simply connected then the deck group and the fundamental group are isomorphic .",
    "this is true as mentioned earlier when @xmath0 is a compact poincar space  and also when @xmath0 is a locally compact , pathwise connected topological group ( cf .",
    "if @xmath0 is connected and uniformly locally pathwise connected then the pathwise connected component of @xmath65 is dense in @xmath21 ( proposition [ dense ] ) and therefore @xmath21 is connected . in this case",
    "it is also true that @xmath66 is dense in @xmath19 .",
    "note that , in the case of the surface @xmath38 described above , @xmath38 is itself universal .",
    "@xmath38 is pathwise connected but not simply connected and correspondingly @xmath67 is surjective but not injective .    as another example , consider the ( closed ) topologist s sine curve @xmath68 , illustrated in figure [ tsc ] with its universal cover .",
    "the deck group of @xmath69 is @xmath41 ; the action shifts the universal cover in a way similar to the action of @xmath41 on @xmath70 .",
    "note that arbitrarily fine chains may wrap around @xmath68 , while no path does .",
    "hence the deck group indicates topology where the fundamental group , which is trivial in this case , does not .",
    "finally , @xmath71 is simply connected but not pathwise connected , and correspondingly @xmath72 is injective but not surjective ( and the image of @xmath62 need not be dense in the deck group because @xmath68 is not locally pathwise connected ) .",
    "we show that if @xmath0 is coverable with uniform dimension @xmath73 in a sense due to isbell ( @xcite ) then @xmath21 has the same property ( theorem [ dimthm ] ) , and we conjecture that the the uniform dimensions of @xmath0 and @xmath65 are the same .",
    "when @xmath0 has dimension @xmath74 , we show that @xmath65 is simply connected and contains no topological circles . as a consequence",
    "the function @xmath62 is injective .",
    "we prove some results concerning dimension and coverable spaces , although it seems much more may be said .",
    "further progress may require additional work extending theorems concerning covering dimension to theorems about uniform dimension . however , this partial result is particularly useful when @xmath75 because then @xmath21 is forced to be at most one dimensional  and if @xmath0 contains any non - trivial curve then the uniform dimension of @xmath76 must be exactly @xmath74 .",
    "one - dimensional metric spaces are of interest since they include , for example , planar fractals and metrized cayley graphs , as well as many familiar pathalogical examples .",
    "it is known that the fundamental group of a compact , connected , @xmath74-dimensional metrizable space embeds in an inverse limit of free groups .",
    "given this fact , it seems very likely that for appropriate choice of @xmath3 , the groups @xmath77 are finitely generated free groups when @xmath0 is compact , connected , and @xmath74-dimensional .",
    "we have verified this in some special cases ( see section [ pssec ] ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to know whether for suitable choice of @xmath3 , @xmath78 is free when @xmath0 is coverable ( or just connected ? ) of uniform dimension @xmath74 .    in this paper",
    "we show that , if @xmath0 is coverable of uniform dimension @xmath79 then @xmath21 has no topological circles ( proposition [ circle ] ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath21 is simply connected and hence ( assuming @xmath0 is pathwise connected ) @xmath80 is an embedding . in general , @xmath21 may not be pathwise connected and hence @xmath62 may not be surjective , but at least in the case when @xmath0 is uniformly locally pathwise connected we know that the ( isomorphic ) image of the fundamental group is dense in the deck group . in other words , @xmath0 is a quotient via a free action of its fundamental group on a connected , simply connected , uniformly one dimensional space .",
    "we conclude with a general result about metric spaces . given a metric space @xmath81 , @xmath21 is metrizable ( proposition [ metrizable ] ) , and if @xmath0 is coverable then by definition of cover the action of @xmath19 on @xmath65 is isomorphic in the sense that there is a uniformity base for @xmath21 that is invariant with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether there is a metric on @xmath21 with respect to which the action of @xmath19 is isometric and such that the metric on @xmath21 is the quotient metric .",
    "( since @xmath19 is complete and acts prodiscretely , the orbits of @xmath19 are closed and hence if @xmath21 has an invariant metric there is a well defined quotient metric on @xmath0 , namely the distance between the corresponding orbits in @xmath21see @xcite , 4.4 for details on quotient metrics . ) we do not know the answer to this question in general . however , if one examines the proof in @xcite that a uniform space with a countable base possesses a compatible pseudometric , it is clear that the explicitly constructed pseudometric is invariant with respect to the action of a group @xmath82 if the entourages used in the construction are invariant . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath0 is a coverable metric space then we may put a metric on @xmath21 that is invariant with respect to the action of @xmath19 . although the quotient metric on @xmath0 may not be the original , it is still uniformly equivalent to the original .",
    "this proves :    if @xmath0 is a coverable metric space then @xmath0 is uniformly homeomorphic to the metric quotient @xmath83 of a universal metric space @xmath46 with respect to the isometric prodiscrete action of a group @xmath82 isomorphic to @xmath19 .",
