    "with their characteristic period - luminosity ( pl ) and period - luminosity - color ( plc ) relations , classical cepheids play a relevant role as distance indicators for the definition of the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "the application of a large magellanic cloud ( lmc)-based pl relation to external galaxies observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , has led to the calibration of secondary distance indicators and in turn to an estimate of the hubble constant ( @xmath4 , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the theoretical explanation for the observational evidence of a pl relation for classical cepheids relies on the assumption that intermediate mass stars undergoing central helium burning are characterized by a mass - luminosity ( ml ) relation , as predicted by stellar evolution models .",
    "the ml relation is significantly dependent on several physical and numerical assumptions adopted in stellar evolution models , thus the comparison between observations and cepheid evolutionary / pulsation models provides a unique insight into the stellar evolution and pulsation physics .",
    "an important issue still under debate is the universality of the cepheid pl relations , and , in turn , the possibility of applying lmc - calibrated cepheid pl relations to infer the distance of any galaxy containing cepheids , independently of its chemical composition . in the last decade",
    "many efforts were devoted to investigate the dependence of the cepheid properties on metallicity , since a metallicity effect could produce significant systematic errors in the evaluation of the extragalactic distance scale and in turn on @xmath4 .",
    "however , no general consensus has been reached yet .",
    "on the theoretical side , linear non adiabatic models mostly suggest that a variation in chemical composition produces negligible effects on the pl relations ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while nonlinear convective pulsation models @xcite predict a significant metallicity effect on the cepheid instability strip ( hereinafter is ) topology and on the pl relations .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite find that the synthetic pl relations become shallower as the metallicity increases , and the size of the effect depends also on the photometric band , with a decreasing sensitivity as wavelength increases from optical to near infrared ( nir ) bands .",
    "consequently , metal - rich pulsators with periods longer than five days have fainter optical magnitudes than metal - poor pulsators .",
    "this scenario is further complicated by the theoretical finding that the helium mass fraction @xmath5 also plays a role at the highest metallicities ( @xmath6 ) , with the slope of the linear pls increasing as @xmath5 increases at fixed @xmath7 @xcite . in turn",
    ", the metallicity correction to the predicted distance moduli varies with the assumed @xmath8 , showing a sort of turnover around solar metallicity .",
    "in particular , for p @xmath9 20 days and [ o / h ] @xmath9 0.2 dex , as measured in several spiral galaxies observed by the hst key project @xcite , the average predicted metallicity correction varies from @xmath100.2 mag to @xmath11 + 0.25 mag , as @xmath8 increases from 2.0 to 3.5 .    on the empirical side , several authors suggest that metal - rich cepheids are , at fixed period , brighter than metal - poor ones , either over the entire period range @xcite , or at least for periods shorter than @xmath12 25 days @xcite .",
    "@xcite by comparing distances based on cepheids and on the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) method for a selected sample of spiral galaxies , found that the metallicity effect , usually expressed in the form @xmath13 , is equal to @xmath140.25 mag dex@xmath15 .",
    "however , the revised trgb distances by @xcite no longer support a @xmath16 value of @xmath140.25 mag dex@xmath15 and are in better agreement with the theoretical results ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "other empirical results that seem to support the nonlinear theoretical scenario were obtained by @xcite , on the basis of spectroscopic [ fe / h ] measurements for galactic and magellanic cloud cepheids . using only their spectroscopic abundances for galactic cepheids with published distances",
    ", @xcite found that the metallicity correction is in qualitative agreement with the model results , and shows the same kind of turnover around solar metallicity as predicted by nonlinear pulsation theory .",
    "more recently , using direct high resolution metallicity measurements for a total of 68 galactic and magellanic cepheids , @xcite found that metallicity affects the @xmath17-band cepheid pl relation , with metal - rich cepheids appearing to be systematically fainter than metal - poor ones , in agreement with the theoretical predictions by @xcite and @xcite , and independently of the adopted distance scale for galactic and lmc cepheids .    on the other hand , direct empirical tests of the metallicity effect based on the observation of cepheids in the outer and inner fields of m101 @xcite , in ngc4258 @xcite , and , recently , in m33 @xcite ,",
    "should be taken with caution .",
    "indeed , in m101 the presence of blended cepheids could have affected the results of the test ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while in the case of ngc4258 there is evidence against the assumed metallicity gradient , as both the comparison with pulsation models and the most recent hii abundance measurements @xcite suggest a rather constant lmc - like metal - content for the cepheids observed in the two selected fields ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . in m33 , @xcite adopted the [ o / h ] gradient by @xcite and conclude that blending can not account for the difference in distance modulus between the two fields . however , as also pointed out by @xcite , these results are always based on indirect measurements of the metallicity , assumed to be that corresponding to the oxygen nebular abundances of hii regions at the same galactocentric distance of the cepheids",
    ".    finally , there are also recent empirical results in favour of the universality of the pl slope : distance estimates based on the `` near - infrared surface brightness '' ( isb ) technique ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and the hst parallaxes @xcite for ten galactic cepheids seem to indicate a vanishing metallicity effect between galactic and magellanic cepheids .",
    "similar suggestions have been put forward by several authors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for cepheids in galaxies with metallicities significantly lower than the lmc , but no theoretical predictions are available in the literature for the metallicity effect on the properties of cepheids in this range of abundances or at lower z.    the identification and study of cepheids in very metal - poor galaxies , is a challenging perspective .",
    "these galaxies represent the closest analog to primordial galaxies in the early universe and , as such , offer the best place where to study star formation and stellar evolution in a ( almost ) pristine environment .",
    "some of these galaxies have also been claimed to be primordial systems just forming in the local universe due to lack of detection of faint red stars on the red giant branch tip ( trgb , stars older than @xmath111 gyr ) .",
    "however , the lack of these stars may also be due to a much larger distance of these systems that does not allow to resolve the faint trgb stars .",
    "a precise determination of the distance of these galaxies through cepheids allows us to verify or confute their nature of young nearby galaxies . in the context of the hst acs",
    "go program 10586 ( pi : a. aloisi ) we have identified three classical cepheids in the blue compact dwarf galaxy izw18 , having respectively periods of 8.71 , 125 and 130.3 days .",
    "a new estimate of the distance , and , in turn , of the age of the galaxy stellar populations were obtained both from the classical cepheids and from the galaxy s trgb , which allowed us to rule out the possibility that izw18 is a truly primordial galaxy of recent formation in the local universe @xcite . at the same time",
    "this project also provided a first sample of ultra - low metallicity ( @xmath18 ) classical cepheids @xcite , thus representing an important benchmark for the pulsation models .    in this paper",
    "we investigate theoretically the pulsation properties of cepheids at this very low metallicity ( z=0.0004 ) , in order to probe the metallicity effect at z @xmath19 0.004 , and to provide a theoretical scenario for the classical cepheids recently detected in izw18 @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we present the new set of pulsation models ; in sections 3 and 4 we show our results for the topology of the is and the behaviour of the light curves , while the multi - filter plc , period - wesenheit and pl relations are presented and discussed in sect .",
    "5 . finally , in sect . 6 we discuss the comparison with the cepheids observed in izw18 and the implications for the cepheid distance scale .",
    "conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "using the same pulsation code ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) adopted in our previous investigations of more metallic cepheids @xcite , we investigated for the first time the full amplitude behaviour of metal - poor cepheid models . to this purpose",
    "we fixed the metal and helium abundances at @xmath1 , @xmath2 and selected model stellar masses in the range from 4 to 13 @xmath20 .",
    "two luminosity levels ( see table 1 ) were assumed for most of the selected stellar masses corresponding to canonical and mild overshooting ( noncanonical ) evolutionary predictions , respectively .",
    "the canonical scenario is provided by the pisa evolutionary library ( pel ) for @xmath21 and discussed in @xcite we extrapolated the ml relation obtained for lower masses taking into account the evidence that , for higher metal content , models with 13 @xmath20 follow the same ml relation as lower mass models . ] , while the noncanonical luminosity level is obtained by adding 0.25 dex ( in @xmath22 ) to the canonical value , according to the prescriptions by @xcite . for each mass and luminosity , an extensive range of effective temperatures was explored for pulsation instability , in order to derive the location of the blue and red edges of the is in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram . for canonical models",
    ", we also explored the effect of varying the mixing length parameter @xmath23 , adopted in the code to close the nonlinear system of dynamical and convective equations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) , in the range from the standard value of 1.5 to 2.0 . in the following two sections we discuss the results obtained for the topology of the is , and for the morphological properties of the bolometric light curves , respectively .",
    "for each selected mass and luminosity , the effective temperatures of the hottest pulsating fundamental model , increased by 50 k ( fundamental blue edge , hereafter fbe ) , and of the coolest pulsating fundamental model , decreased by 50 k ( fundamental red edge , hereafter fre ) are reported in the third and fourth columns of table 1 , respectively .",
    "the adopted uncertainty of 50 k in the location of the is boundaries stems from our adopted effective temperature step of 100 k in the model selection .",

    "for the first overtone mode , canonical pulsators show a stable oscillation only for stellar masses smaller than or equal to 7 @xmath20 , while we verified that the first overtone is disappears increasing the mass by only 0.1 @xmath20 .",
    "noncanonical first overtone models present a stable limit cycle only for masses @xmath24 .",
    "the first overtone is boundaries are reported in table 2 .",
    "our theoretical results confirm that the longest period for first overtone pulsators ( @xmath25 ) increases as the metal content decreases , being of about 9 days at z=0.0004 and of about 6 days at z=0.004 @xcite .",
    "as already discussed by @xcite , this behaviour is in marginal agreement with observational evidence in the milky way and in the magellanic clouds , and at variance with results from linear pulsation models that predict the opposite trend .",

    "the solid lines represent the fbe and fre , while the dashed lines are the boundaries of the first overtone instability strip .",

    "we notice that the location of the new boundaries confirms the trend already found at higher metal content up to @xmath30 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) that the predicted is moves toward lower effective temperatures as the metallicity increases . in fact , the fbe for @xmath1 is bluer than the one for @xmath3 because of the increased abundance of hydrogen that produces an higher efficiency of the hydrogen ionization region in driving pulsation . for the same reason ,",
    "the fre for @xmath1 is cooler than the one for @xmath3 for masses lower than about 9@xmath20 . at higher masses and luminosities ( lower densities ) , the simultaneous effect of the lower metallicity , combined with the high efficiency of convection ( that reduces the driving role of both hydrogen and helium ionization regions ) , prevails and produces a hotter red edge .",
    "however , the effect seems to be relatively small , so that no relevant implication on the zero point and on the slope of the theoretical pl relations are expected when moving from the typical metal contents of the magellanic clouds to the significantly lower abundance of izw18 ( see below ) .",

    "for this reason , in the following we will focus only on the wesenheit relations , that have much lower intrinsic scatter caused by the finite width of the instability strip , and on the light curve model fitting technique .",
    "in particular , due to the unusually long periods of two of the 3 cepheids found in izw18 ( namely , @xmath39=125 for v15 , and 130.3 days for v1 , see @xcite , for the identification of the variables ) , we will apply these two theoretical methods only to the bona fide classical cepheid in izw18 , namely star v6",

    "as these relations are reddening free , the shift required to superimpose the observed distributions to the theoretical relations directly gives the intrinsic distance modulus . by applying to v6 the canonical and noncanonical period - wesenheit relations in the @xmath53 bands , we obtain two estimates of the distance modulus of the galaxy and the associated uncertainties , as labelled in each panel of fig .",
    "the two inferred values are consistent with each other within the errors and in agreement with our previous estimates of the distance to izw18 obtained in @xcite , and in particular with the distance based on the trgb ( @xmath54 mag ) .    an independent constraint on the distance to izw18 can also be obtained by applying the light curve model fitting technique to v6 .",
