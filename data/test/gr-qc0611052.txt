    "an analogous consideration shows that @xmath92 has spin - weight @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , in the decomposition of @xmath77 , there are four independent scalars i.e. @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which have respective spin - weights of @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath100",

    "we now introduce two more vectors : @xmath118 which is tangent to the temporal coordinates world line and a spacelike shift vector @xmath119 .",
    "the tangent is decomposed according to @xmath120 therefore , the lie derivative ( in the directon of @xmath1 ) operating on a _ covariant and spacelike _ tensor becomes , @xmath121 similarly , the twisiting of the two - sheet in the background also vanishes i.e. @xmath122 . therefore , _ under the additional condition of zero twisting _ , the two - sheet meshes to form a two - surface , where @xmath39 is the corresponding normal .",
    "since we require this normal to be hypersurface orthognal , we again use frobenius  theorem to conclude @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are analogous to the lapse and cauchy time functions such that @xmath126 . a spacelike vector , @xmath127 ,",

    "they constitute a covariant description of how the lie derivatives and normal vectors are aligned with respect to coordinate tangents in vorticity / twist free spacetimes .",

    "it is important to stress that a background three - tensor will have a corresponding first - order tensor which is not spacelike with respect to the background .",
    "instead , it will attain a first - order timelike component @xcite .",
    "similarly , a background two - tensor will have a corresponding first - order tensor which is not a two - tensor with respect to the background .",
    "consider some perturbed two - tensor which therefore satisfies the covariant relationships @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "these relationships , which also hold true in the background spacetime @xmath142 and @xmath143 , are then expressed to first - order according to @xmath144 thus , it is clear that the first - order term ( @xmath145 ) is not a two - tensor with respect to the background ( i.e. does not vanish when contracted with @xmath1 or @xmath39 ) , and instead it now satisfies the first - order relationships .",

    "this may be expanded to first - order , and its corresponding first - order component is decomposed into 1 + 1 + 2 form in the usual fashion , @xmath147 in the situation where the background two - tensor ( @xmath148 ) vanishes , the first - order terms reduce to two - tensors according to .",

    "this is a consequence of the stewart - walker - sachs lemma @xcite , which states that a quantity which vanishes in the background has a corresponding first - order quantity that is gauge - invariant .",
    "there are three quantities which do not vanish in the background , and will experience first - order increments according to @xmath151 thus @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 are not gauge - invariant .",
    "finally , the first - order energy - momentum perturbations are all gauge - invariant , as they vanish on the background , hence @xmath155",
    "we now consider the bianchi identities .",
    "it is the twice contracted bianchi identities which provide the linear equations governing the energy - momentum perturbations .",

    "the once - contracted bianchi identities for einstein s equations have a rich correspondence with the equations governing electromagnetism .",
    "we show how two decoupled , covariant and complex equations arise naturally from these identities .",
    "therefore , we give them extra attention and provide a discussion of the fully non - linear equations before writing down the linearized system .",
