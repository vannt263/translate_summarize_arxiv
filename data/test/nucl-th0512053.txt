    "in recent years isospin dependent phenomena received much consideration because of their ability to reveal information on the asymmetry term of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "relying on the fact that in heavy systems in which the neutron density exceeds the proton density the asymmetry term is repulsive for neutrons and attractive for protons , theoretical models of heavy ion reactions predicted different neutron composition of the liquid and vapor phases @xcite . more important for studies on eos , the difference in chemical composition of the gas and liquid phases during a liquid - gas phase transition reflects the magnitude of the asymmetry term and its density dependence .",
    "thus , the seminal work of mueller and serot @xcite based on a relativistic mean - field model of nuclear matter with arbitrary proton fraction anticipated that is energetically more favorable for an unstable asymmetric nuclear matter to separate into a neutron rich low density phase and a neutron poor high density one . later on , the isospin dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck transport model @xcite , different mean field approaches @xcite , the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics model @xcite , the stochastic mean field model @xcite , etc .",

    "moreover , in order to offer a more realistic description of the dynamics of charged asymmetric nuclear matter ref .",
    "@xcite analyzes the effect of the long - range coulomb interaction reaching the conclusion that its effect is to diminish the isospin fractionation .    trying to identify this process in experimental multifragmentation data , isoscaling techniques based on grandcanonical assumptions",
    "have been applied .",
    "the results obtained from reactions involving different combinations of @xmath2sn and @xmath3sn at 50 mev / nucleon bombarding energy @xcite , @xmath4sn+@xmath5ni central collisions at 35 mev / nucleon @xcite , multifragmentation reactions induced by high energy protons @xcite and @xmath6ni,@xmath6fe + @xmath6ni,@xmath6fe at 30 , 40 and 47 mev / nucleon @xcite proved the expected increase of neutron concentration in the gas phase with respect to the liquid phase .    the aim of the present work is to investigate fragment average isospin distributions within a microcanonical multifragmentation model which includes in a realistic way the most important ingredients of the nuclear multifragmentation phenomenon and whose phase diagram was studied previously .",
    "the advantages of such a study are obvious .",
    "firstly , taking into account that decaying nuclei are small isolated systems , a rigorous statistical treatment requires a microcanonical framework and not an analytically tractable grandcanonical approach . secondly , with respect to dynamical models , statistical models have the advantage of dealing with precisely defined fragments .",
    "thus , this study is expected to offer a complementary understanding of the problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the results obtained within the microcanonical multifragmentation model ( mmm ) @xcite in three distinct cases : ( 200 , 82 ) with and without coulomb interaction and ( 50 , 23 ) with coulomb interaction .",
    "fragments average isospin distributions are investigated as a function of fragment charge in each situation .",
    "characteristic shapes of @xmath0 versus @xmath1 distributions are found in each zone of the phase diagram .",
    "interesting finite size effects are identified for low multiplicities .",
    "section iii investigates the dependence of the above distributions as a function of source isospin . to verify whether the observed signals survive the sequential evaporation stage , effects of the secondary decays are discussed in section iv . in order to establish a link with dynamical models predictions , interpretation of the gas and liquid phases with respect to the cluster size",
    "is performed in section v. conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "while methods to identify phase transitions in small non - extensive systems accumulate , more importance is given to the fact that by principle the most correct statistical approach to be used for exploding nuclei is the microcanonical one @xcite .",
    "in the present paper the mmm version @xcite of the microcanonical multifragmentation model @xcite is used .    in this model fragments",
    "are placed in a spherical container defining the freeze - out volume .",
    "all configurations allowed by mass , charge , total energy , total momentum and total angular momentum conservation laws and not forbidden by geometrical constraints ( overlapping between fragments or with container s walls ) are spanned by a metropolis monte carlo trajectory in the configuration space .",
    "the key quantity of the model is the weight of each configuration which has a non - analytically tractable form and enters the expression of any physical observable .",
    "the break - up fragments relevant for thermodynamics may be excited highly enough to de - excite by sequential particle emission .",
    "if not explicitly mentioned otherwise , the present study focuses on the break - up stage of the reaction but for the sake of completeness a brief discussion of effects of secondary decays will be included .",
    "depending on whether fragments are assimilated with hard non - overlapping spheres ( i ) or normal nuclear density malleable objects ( ii ) , one may distinguish two freeze - out scenarios .",
    "even if for a given state of the statistically equilibrated source characterized by the mass , charge , excitation energy and freeze - out volume the two scenarios may lead to different results , the thermodynamics associated to the model is qualitatively the same .",
    "the ( ii ) freeze - out scenario has the important advantage of allowing the system to reach high densities being thus preferable when one aims to investigate the phase diagram .    while realistic by their microcanonical foundation , statistical multifragmentation models may be criticized because of the too simplistic treatment of the freeze - out volume .",
    "indeed , it is hard to imagine that fragment production into vacuum takes place in a fixed size spherical box , but rather in a volume fluctuating from event to event and characterized by it average value .",
    "statistical models used the fixed volume hypotheses in order to diminish , presumably without significant consequences , the dimension of the configuration space .",
    "more recent works @xcite suggest to treat the multifragmenting nucleus in a modified microcanonical ensemble in which the volume is allowed to fluctuate and the microcanonical weight of a configuration @xmath7 is multiplied by @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the inverse temperature and @xmath10 is a pressure ) , the average value of the volume being determined by its lagrange multiplier @xmath11 .",
    "the fact that in the case of time dependent open systems the thermodynamical definition of volume is still an open problem is illustrated by the different concepts presently employed .",
    "thus , dynamical models define the freeze - out volume by the spatial extension of the system when fragments cease to interact with each other otherwise than by coulomb field , implying thus a minimum distance of 2 - 3 fm between them . a somehow similar image in the sense that volume does not act as an external constraint corresponds to the dynamical models which define the freeze - out volume with respect to the freeze - out time , a notion which assumes chemical equilibrium : fragments can still exchange nucleons but their multiplicity has to be time independent .",
    "maybe one of the most illustrative examples on what freeze - out volume may mean within dynamical models in contrast to the statistical ones , is given by the recent study of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "authors show that freeze - out volume depends dramatically on freeze - out instant and fragment multiplicity . as the message of the present work relies on the thermodynamical characterization of the nuclear system",
    ", we stress that in the case of mmm the volume is even more than an un - physical fictitious container which obliges the _ pre - formed _ fragments not to separate , but dictates also their partition as volume enters the statistical weight of a configuration . apart the obvious explicit dependence , volume acts via the thermal kinetic energy defined as the difference between the total available energy ( input quantity ) and all other partial energies ( internal excitation , coulomb interaction and fragment formation @xmath12 ) .",
    "the phase diagram associated with mmm was studied in ref . @xcite and",
    "the conclusions must be underlined . for small systems , like ( 50 , 23 ) ,",
    "irrespectively whether the coulomb interaction is present or not , the system evolves from the liquid phase present at low excitation energies to the gas phase corresponding to vaporized matter by crossing the coexistence zone . for large systems , like ( 200 , 82 ) , which experience stronger coulomb fields",
    ", the situation becomes more interesting .",
    "when one turns the coulomb interaction off , the system exhibits the same behavior as a small system .",
    "when the coulomb field is activated the critical temperature and pressure decrease such that , for freeze - out volumes up to about @xmath13 , the system may evolve from the liquid phase to gas or supercritical fluid without crossing the phase coexistence zone @xcite .    in the following",
    "we shall present the mmm predictions on fragment average isospin distributions in different points of the nuclear phase diagram and stress the fact that @xmath0 versus @xmath1 manifests different behavior in the liquid , phase coexistence and gas regions . as a general comment",
    ", we mention that the investigation of the phase space along constant @xmath11 paths was arbitrary and the description of the system within a modified microcanonical ensemble with fluctuating volume @xcite is not essential for the conclusions of the present study . thus , the same behavior of @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 distributions determined by the event localization inside the phase diagram was obtained for constant volume approximation ( standard microcanonical approach ) .",
    "the phase diagram of the nuclear system ( 200 , 82 ) without coulomb and hard - core interactions ( ( ii ) freeze - out scenario ) is represented in fig .",

    "the borders of the phase coexistence region were evaluated using maxwell construction on the iso-@xmath11 caloric curves and are plotted with dashed lines .",
    "the borders of the spinodal region are defined as the locus of the inflexion points of @xmath17 curves and are plotted with dotted lines .",
    "the critical point is characterized by the following set of values : @xmath18=9.1 mev , @xmath19 mev/@xmath20 , @xmath21=6.75 mev / nucleon and @xmath22=1.33 .    the shapes of @xmath0 versus @xmath1 distributions have been investigated along all iso-@xmath11 paths represented in fig .",

    "thus , as the excitation energy increases from 2 to 12 mev / nucleon , the temperature ranges around 6 mev and the average freeze - out volume increases linearly from 2@xmath24 to 16@xmath24 .    once clarified the thermodynamical behavior of the system and before investigating the fragment average isospin distributions as a function of fragment size , it is useful to have a clear picture on the fragment size distributions produced in the considered multifragmentation events .",

    "[ fig:200_-c_z ] is that by increasing the excitation energy the centroid of the @xmath28 distribution shifts toward lower values while its shape evolves in a complicated manner .",

    "moreover , in the coexistence region the average isospin of a fragment belonging to the liquid is monotonically decreasing with its charge .    the occurrence of the liquid + under - saturated vapor phase at low values of excitation energy and/or freeze - out volume prevents fragment production in the intermediate size domain ( @xmath30 ) , as evidenced in fig .",

    "the effect of excitation energy on @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 distributions within a given region of the phase diagram is quite trivial .",

    "the striking difference between the coordinates of this critical point and the one corresponding to the ( 200,82 ) without coulomb case is not only a finite - size effect , but mainly the consequence of including the coulomb interaction .",

    "the choice of @xmath60 as criterion for phase definition is arbitrary and similar results have been obtained when @xmath61 has been used .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : iso_f_b ] depicts the relative neutron enrichment of the `` free '' phase with respect to the `` bound '' phase for the ( 200 , 82 ) nuclear system with ( without ) coulomb interaction along the @xmath42 @xmath15 and @xmath62 @xmath15 ( @xmath14 @xmath15 ) constant paths .",
    "as one may see , for all considered cases @xmath63 is larger than one , meaning that isospin distillation takes place and its exact values depends on the observables characterizing the state of the source .",
    "we mention at this point that relative neutron enrichment of the free phase decreasing with increasing energy was evidenced also by dynamical models @xcite , a quantitative comparison being nevertheless impossible because of different definitions of phases .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig : iso_f_b ] represents the dependence of the relative enrichment of the `` free '' phase as a function of source isospin .",
    "as expected , more isospin asymmetric is the initial system , more neutron rich is the corresponding `` free '' phase obtained by multifragmentation .",
    "similar linear behavior was reported by dynamical models @xcite .",
    "an important remark to be made is that , at least in the framework of the presently used microcanonical multifragmentation model , the neutron enrichment of the `` free '' phase with respect to the `` bound '' phase is not necessarily connected with phase coexistence since manifests even for the ( 200 , 82 ) , with coulomb interaction case where , for freeze - out volumes smaller than several tens @xmath24 , the employed model does not enter phase coexistence region ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : iso_f_b ] ) .",
    "fragment isospin distributions have been investigated in the framework of a microcanonical multifragmentation model .",
    "the obtained distributions manifest different shapes in the liquid , liquid - gas and gas regions of the phase diagram . for small systems with low excitation energies mass and charge conservation constraints",
    "modify the shape of @xmath0 versus @xmath1 distributions from a monotonically increasing one to a one having a maximum .",
    "distributions of the largest fragment in each event expected to be a good order parameter of the phase transition and a reliable estimation of the liquid part does not manifest bimodality in the whole phase coexistence zone and confirm the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite stating that mass conservation induces modifications of the @xmath28 distributions from the one obtained in infinite systems .",
    "moreover , for low excitation energies @xmath28 shows bimodality outside the coexistence region due to the interplay between evaporation and fission as decay mechanisms .",
    "isospin fractionation is found to be compatible with a microcanonical multifragmentation scenario and effects of secondary particle emission and isospin of the source are investigated .",
    "phase classification according to the cluster size proves that neutron enrichment of the `` free '' phase with respect to the `` bound '' one depends on the source state .",
    "finally , neutron enrichment of the `` free '' phase is not a signal of phase coexistence since it is observed everywhere in the phase space .",
