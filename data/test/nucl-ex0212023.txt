    "directed and elliptic flow is sensitive to the equation of state of nuclear matter . as the energy density in the interaction zone varies with collision energy and impact parameter , the energy and centrality dependence can provide information about the equation of state and a possible phase transition from hadronic to partonic matter .",
    "directed and elliptic flow measurements at the full beam energy of 158  agev were published by na49 @xcite based on the statistics of 120k events . all together",
    "na49 recorded in 1996 360k events using a minimum bias centrality trigger . to increase statistics in the central bins we added 120k events taken with a trigger selecting only the 12.5% most central events . in 1999 additional data",
    "were taken for the reduced beam energy of 40  agev . at this energy",
    "we have a total of 730k minimum bias events . in the figures we are using three different centrality selections .",
    "the 12.5% most central collisions are labeled as central , the centrality 12.5%-33.5% as mid - central and 33.5%-100% as peripheral .",
    "an event plane method was applied to reconstruct the flow @xcite . for the @xmath1 event plane determination",
    "a @xmath2-weight was used to reduce the influence of non - flow two - particle correlations for particles with low transverse momentum . for the @xmath0 event plane determination the rapidity in the center of mass system was used as a weight .",
    "we also added a correction for correlations caused by transverse momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "we also applied a multi - particle correlation cumulant method to the data .",
    "some results are shown in @xcite .",
    "[ v1graph ]    the dependence of directed flow , @xmath3 , on rapidity is shown in fig .",
    "[ v1graph ] for 40 and 158  agev data and for pions and protons . at 40",
    "agev the sign of the proton directed flow is taken to be positive approaching projectile rapidity .",
    "this determines the pion flow to be negative in this region . at 158",
    "agev the proton data do not approach close enough to projectile rapidity to get a clear signal , so we take the pion flow to be negative in this region as at the lower energy . as required by symmetry directed flow of pions at 40  agev vanishes at midrapidity .",
    "its magnitude increases towards projectile and target and it increases from central to peripheral collisions . directed flow of pions at 158  agev shows qualitatively the same behaviour as for 40  agev . at 40  agev for protons",
    "there is a quite flat plateau around midrapidity .",
    "about one unit of rapidity away from midrapidity it increases rapidly . at 158",
    "agev it seems to be positive for central collisions and changes to negative sign for peripheral collisions . comparing it to 40",
    "agev one has to take into account the different acceptance for 40 and 158  agev : at 40  agev the rapidity coverage relative to the rapidity gap is larger than at 158  agev .",
    "so the shape might be similar for both energies , but the strong rise at the lower energy can not be observed at the full energy .",
    "assuming the same shape for both energies , results in a shape for peripheral collisions , which crosses the zero line three times @xcite .",
    "this _ wiggle _",
    "shape is also visible at 40  agev , but not as pronounced .",
    "however non flow correlations due to resonance decays , which can be of same order of magnitude , might be the reason for this changing sign @xcite .        in figure  [ v2graph ] the rapidity dependence of the elliptic flow , @xmath4 , of pions and protons",
    "is presented for three different centrality selections . for pions",
    "it is quite constant in rapidity for mid - central collisions and peaks near midrapidity for peripheral collisions . for most central collisions @xmath1",
    "was not measured , because the flow is presumably very small , which results in very large statistical errors because of the poor event plane resolution .",
    "elliptic flow of protons seems to be minimal near midrapidity and increase near projectile and target rapidity .",
    "in contrast at 158  agev the rapidity dependence of pion elliptic flow does nt change shape very much with centrality but its average value increases for more peripheral collisions .",
    "the same is observed for proton elliptic flow .",
    "elliptic flow for mid - central collisions versus the center of mass rapidity in comparions for the two energies measured by na49 .",
    "right : @xmath5 elliptic flow at midrapidity for 25% centrality versus the center of mass energy per nucleon pair @xmath6 @xcite . ]",
    "due to the different coverages of phase space at the two energies , we prefer for the comparison differential to integrated values . as the shape of proton flow changes between the two energies and directed flow signal is small near midrapidity , we restrict the comparison to pion elliptic flow . comparing the rapidity dependence of elliptic flow for mid - central collisions scaled to beam rapidity in the center of mass frame ( figure [ edep ] left side ) , one can see a remarkable similarity of the distributions obtained from 40  agev and 158  agev data , except for two points . to avoid problems with the different rapidity coverage of different experiments , only midrapidity values",
    "are now compared to measurements by other experiments ( figure [ edep ] right side ) . here",
    "one sees a rise from ags to rhic , but at sps between 40 and 158  agev it is smaller than anticipated from the overall energy dependence .",
    "however the size of the error bars still leaves the possibility of a constant rise .",
    "the na49 measurements also are in good agreement with the ceres results .",
