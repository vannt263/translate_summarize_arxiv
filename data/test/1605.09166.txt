    "the 2.16-m reflector is an english equatorial mount telescope at xinglong observatory and it obtained the first light in 1989 , which was built / developed by chinese ourselves independently .",
    "the effective aperture of the telescope is 2.16 meter , and the focal ratio of the primary mirror is f/3 @xcite .",
    "the effective aperture of the secondary mirror is 0.717 m. currently , there are two available foci for mounting astronomical observing instruments , the cassegrain focus and the coud focus . for the cassegrain focus , which is a r - c system , the focal ratio is f/9 , and the scale on the focal plane is @xmath3/mm .",
    "while for the coud system , it is f/45 , and the scale on the focal plane is @xmath4/mm .",
    "the most special character of the optical system is that the cassegrain system and the coud system share the same secondary mirror and there is a relay mirror in the coud system , and both systems can sufficiently eliminate the spherical aberration and coma aberration @xcite .    since its first light in 1989 ,",
    "the 2.16-m telescope has been used in various scientific research fields in galactic and extragalactic astrophysics , including the determination of stellar parameters ( e.g. , abundances , surface gravity , temperatures ) of a large sample of stars , the discoveries of substellar and planetary companions of stars , studies of active galaxy nuclei ( agn ) , including the identifications of high - redshift quasars , discoveries and studies of supernovae , e.g. , 1993j @xcite , as well as time - domain science ( e.g. , supernovae , gamma - ray bursts , stellar tidal disruption events , and variable stars ) .",
    "although the 2.16-m telescope is the third largest optical telescope in china right now ( smaller than lamost and the lijiang 2.4-m telescopes , which were installed in 2008 and 2007 , respectively ) , it plays an important role in chinese astronomical observations .",
    "every year there are hundreds of chinese astronomers applying for observing time at the 2.16-m telescope , including significant numbers of new telescope users and graduate students .",
