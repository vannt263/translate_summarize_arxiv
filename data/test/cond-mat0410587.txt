    "the recent discovery of superconductivity co - existing with ferromagnetism in uge@xmath0 @xcite , zrzn@xmath0 @xcite , and urhge @xcite have revived the long - standing interest to the interplay of the two phenomena . although the microscopic mechanism responsible for superconducting pairing in the presence of a ferromagnetic background is still subject to considerable controversy",
    ", some useful information about the properties of these systems can be obtained from a phenomenological approach , based on general symmetry arguments and the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations , see e.g. ref .",
    "a symmetry - based description of ferromagnetic ( fm ) superconductors has been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the non - magnetic case , a phenomenological theory of superconductivity in the presence of ferromagnetism should include the effects of internal magnetic induction @xmath1 created by the macroscopic fm magnetization @xmath2 . that the coupling of the orbital motion of electron charges with @xmath1 would suppress superconductivity even in zero external field",
    "was pointed out by ginzburg @xcite , who argued that superconductivity could not exist in any of the fm materials known at that time . while valid in a single - domain ferromagnet , his argument should be taken with care if @xmath1 is non - uniform . in order to minimize the magnetic field energy",
    ", it is energetically favorable for a macroscopic ferromagnet to break up into domains of size @xmath3 with opposite directions of the magnetization @xmath2 , separated by domain walls ( dws ) of thickness @xmath4 . due to the spatial variation of the internal field",
    ", it is expected that the suppression of superconductivity in the vicinity of a dw is not as strong as in the bulk , as was first hypothesized in ref .",
    "the quantitative analysis shows @xcite that the superconducting critical temperature near a dw is indeed higher than the bulk critical temperature deep inside the domain .",
    "the reason is that the effective gl potential near the wall has the same double - well shape as near a superconductor - insulator interface , leading to a local enhancement of superconductivity similar to the surface sheath effect @xcite .",
    "the same model was recently extended in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the critical temperature of the superconducting dw in an external magnetic field .    in all previous treatments of the superconducting dw problem",
    "it was assumed that the superconducting coupling constant is the same throughout the system .",
    "however , it can be expected that , whatever the microscopic pairing mechanism , the conditions for the formation of the cooper pairs near the dw and far from it are different .",
    "the fm magnetization affects the electrons via the orbital interaction of the electron charges with the induction @xmath1 , the exchange band splitting , and also the zeeman coupling of the electron spins with @xmath1 .",
    "because of the spatial variation of both the exchange field and the internal induction , all three mechanisms could change both the single - electron spectrum and the electron - electron interactions in the vicinity of the dw , compared to the bulk of the domains . in particular , the strength of the cooper pairing could be locally enhanced or suppressed near the wall .",
    "also , the dw creates a potential barrier for electrons travelling from one domain to the other .",
    "the possibility of a non - perfect transparency of the barrier should therefore be included in the theory .",
    "we assume that the thickness of the wall is small compared with the length scales of superconductivity : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the coherence length and @xmath7 is the london penetration depth . then , in addition to the usual ( i.e. single - domain ) terms , the general phenomenological gl functional includes interface contributions localized near the dw , which describe the variation of the pairing strength and a finite transparency of the dw for electrons .",
    "these additional terms affect the boundary conditions for the superconducting order parameter at the wall @xcite , and the problem then becomes formally similar to that of the localized superconductivity near a planar crystalline defect , which has been extensively studied in the context of the twinning plane superconductivity in high-@xmath8 cuprates and other superconductors @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to study the phase diagram of the localized dw superconductivity in a general phenomenological model .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we formulate our model and derive the gl equations with appropriate boundary conditions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase diagram ] , we calculate the critical temperature of the dw superconductivity as a function of an external field . the evolution of the shape of the superconducting nucleus in the non - linear regime below the critical temperature is studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonlinear ] .",
    "we assume that the curie temperature @xmath9 is higher that the critical temperature @xmath10 and treat the system in the mean - field approximation , so the superconductivity appears in the presence of a static fm background . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the order parameter in a fm superconductor transforms according to one of the irreducible co - representations of the magnetic symmetry group in the normal state . here",
    "we assume that the order parameter has one component @xmath11 , which is always the case in , e.g. , zrzn@xmath0 , assuming that only one of the exchange - split bands is superconducting ( in principle , the pair scattering can induce order parameters of the same symmetry on different sheets of the fermi surface , leading to a more complicated form of the free energy functional than the one used below ) .",
    "the spin quantization axis is chosen parallel to @xmath12 , so that the pairing in both domains occurs in , say , spin - up channel .",
    "thus the superconducting order parameters are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the basis function of the chosen one - dimensional co - representation .",
    "the bulk critical temperature is the same on both sides of the wall and equal to @xmath16 .",
    "we focus here on the case @xmath17 , where @xmath6 is the superconducting coherence length , which allows us to consider a single wall separating two domains with opposite directions of magnetization .",
    "the gl free energy density can be represented as a sum of the bulk contributions from the two domains , and the interface contribution due to the presence of the dw : @xmath18 .",
    "choosing the dw to coincide with the plane @xmath19 , we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the order parameters in the right and left domains respectively , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the magnetic flux quantum ( the electron charge is equal to @xmath26 ) .",
    "the internal magnetic induction is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is an external field .",
    "since the dw thickness is much smaller that @xmath6 , we can approximate the non - uniform magnetization by a step - like function : @xmath29 .",
    "if the external field is directed along the @xmath30 axis , we have @xmath31 , where @xmath32 ( we assume @xmath33 ) . for simplicity , we neglect the anisotropy of the effective mass tensor in the gradient terms .",
    "the dw contribution , which is localized near @xmath19 , can be written in the following general form : @xmath34\\delta(x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with real coefficients @xmath35 .",
    "we keep only the terms quadratic in @xmath36 , which are needed to obtain linear boundary conditions at @xmath19 , see below .",
    "the expression ( [ f wall ] ) is consistent with the symmetry of the system : @xmath37 has to be real and invariant with respect to time reversal ( @xmath38 ) accompanied by the interchange of the two domains ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the parameters of the gl functional depend on the domain magnetization @xmath2 . in particular , in the limit @xmath40 ( no domain wall ) , all @xmath35 should vanish . while the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ f wall ] ) are similar to those discussed in the context of the localized superconductivity at planar crystalline defects @xcite , the last one is unique to the present problem because it requires time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "it turns out however that we can choose @xmath41 without any loss of generality , because the second and third terms in eq .",
    "( [ f wall ] ) can be combined together by rotating the order parameter phases separately in each domain : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "for the same reason , the sign of @xmath44 is not important , in particular one can always choose it to be positive : if @xmath45 , then the gauge transformation @xmath46 , @xmath47 changes @xmath48 .    in our phenomenological model",
    "we allow for the order parameter to be discontinuous across the domain wall , the rationale being that the dw creates a potential barrier for electrons and therefore may behave similar to an extended josephson junction .",
    "the interface terms ( [ f wall ] ) then translate into the linear boundary conditions for @xmath36 , see e.g. ref .",
    "the magnitude of the coupling between the domains , described by the @xmath44 term , depends on the transmission coefficient of the dw for electrons , which in turn is determined by the thickness and the structure of the wall . in the limit of zero transparency , @xmath49 and",
    "the domains are completely decoupled .",
    "the continuity of the order parameter is restored in the limit @xmath50 , when the interface terms can be written as @xmath51 , which imposes the condition @xmath52 [ and also @xmath53 , see below ] . if @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and a finite @xmath56 , then the order parameter is continuous , and @xmath57 .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath56 , this term describes either a local enhancement ( @xmath58 ) or suppression ( @xmath59 ) of superconductivity near the dw .",
    "far from the wall , the magnetic induction is uniform and the field dependence of the superconducting critical temperature is given by the standard upper critical field expression @xmath60 ( one should keep in mind that @xmath16 itself can be a function of the magnetization ) .",
    "thus the superconductivity in the bulk is suppressed by the internal induction @xmath61 even in the absence of the external field @xcite . at @xmath62 ,",
    "both domains are in the mixed state .",
    "let us now calculate @xmath8 in the vicinity of the wall .",
    "we assume that the phase transition into the superconducting state is of second order at all fields . to find the phase diagram in the external field @xmath28 , we use the linearized gl equations obtained from eq .",
    "( [ f bulk ] ) , with the boundary conditions supplied by the interface terms ( [ f wall ] ) .",
    "the order parameter has the form @xmath63 , where the functions @xmath64 satisfy the equations @xmath65",

    "^ 2f_\\pm+(\\tau-1)f_\\pm=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the dimensionless external magnetic field , and @xmath73 is the dimensionless temperature .",
    "it is easy to see that the zero - field bulk critical temperature @xmath74 corresponds to @xmath75 , while @xmath16 corresponds to @xmath76 .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ bcs gen ] ) become @xmath77    as seen from eqs .",
    "( [ gl eqs ] ) , the effective gl potential @xmath78 is described by two parabolas matched at @xmath19 .",
    "we have to find the absolute minimum of the ground state energy @xmath79 in this potential as a function of the parameter @xmath80 .",
    "the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ gl eqs ] ) that does not diverge ( in fact , vanishes ) at @xmath81 , has the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 are some constants , @xmath84 is the hermite functions @xcite , and @xmath85 these expressions are singular at @xmath86 , which requires special consideration , see below . substituting @xmath87 in the boundary conditions ( [ bcs ] ) and using the fact that @xmath88 , we obtain the solutions of two types . first , there always exists a trivial bulk solution located deep inside the domain with lower induction , for which @xmath89 or @xmath90 and @xmath91 , thus the critical temperature is simply @xmath92 ( at @xmath93 ) .",
    "second , we can also have a non - trivial solution localized near the domain wall , which is sensitive to the values of @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding equation for @xmath94 is    @xmath95      \\left[l_{\\nu_-}\\left(q\\frac{\\sqrt{|1-h|}}{1-h}\\right)-\\frac{\\gamma_1}{\\sqrt{|1-h|}}\\right ]      = \\frac{\\gamma_2 ^ 2}{\\sqrt{|1-h^2|}}.\\ ] ]    here we introduced @xmath96 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath97 is given by the absolute maximum of @xmath94 with respect to @xmath80 at given @xmath98 .",
    "clearly @xmath99 [ this is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ tc eq ] ) being invariant under @xmath100 , therefore we assume @xmath101 .",
    "as mentioned above , the case @xmath102 requires special care , because of the singularities in eq .",
    "( [ tc eq ] ) .",
    "physically , this corresponds to a complete compensation of the internal induction by the external field in the domain @xmath103 .",
    "while @xmath104 in this case is still expressed in terms of the hermite functions , @xmath105 is given by a simple exponential .",
    "the equation for @xmath106 is @xmath107      \\left(\\sqrt{\\tau-1+q^2}+\\gamma_1\\right)+\\gamma_2 ^ 2=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath108 [ note that the critical temperature of the dw superconductivity is never below the bulk critical temperature , in particular @xmath109 .",
    "before discussing the solution of eq .",
    "( [ tc eq ] ) for arbitrary values of @xmath110 and @xmath44 , let us first look at some important particular cases . if the domain wall is completely transparent for the electrons , then @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath111 . in this limit , eq . ( [ tc eq ] ) reduces to @xmath112 in the simplest case @xmath113 , corresponding to the absence of the local enhancement or suppression of superconductivity , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are recovered from eq .",
    "( [ transparent dw ] ) . at zero external field",
    "we have @xmath114 , and eq .",
    "( [ transparent dw ] ) becomes @xmath115 , whose numerical solution shows that the ground state energy @xmath116 reaches its minimum at @xmath117 and @xmath118 . in terms of the critical temperature , this gives @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "thus , superconductivity can exist in the vicinity of the dw at a temperature higher than @xmath74 .",
    "this effect has the same origin as the surface critical field @xmath121 @xcite . at @xmath122 ,",
    "the critical temperature first grows as a function of @xmath98 , because the external field partially compensates the internal induction in one of the domains , and then finally starts to decrease at @xmath123 , see fig . 1 .    at @xmath124 but @xmath125",
    ", we have @xmath126 if the superconductivity is locally suppressed ,",
    "i.e. @xmath59 , then the critical temperature is always lower than at @xmath113 .",

    "the bulk critical temperature @xmath128 serves as the lower boundary for @xmath97 in the limit of strong suppression of superconductivity near the dw . in the opposite limit of large negative @xmath56 ( i.e. strong superconductivity enhancement ) ,",
    "the influence of the variation of the internal induction is less pronounced , so that the phase diagram becomes similar to that of a superconducting plane defect in a non - magnetic crystal @xcite .",
    "the order parameter is continuous and localized in the vicinity of the dw , see figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "another notable feature of the phase diagram is that , in contrast to the upper critical field in the bulk , @xmath97 for the dw superconductivity is quadratic in field at @xmath129 : @xmath130 .",
    "this happens because the localization of the order parameter near the dw makes it possible to treat @xmath98 as a small perturbation , which can not be done in the bulk case .",
    "the opposite case @xmath131 corresponds to completely decoupled domains with the order parameters obeying @xmath132 . as follows from eq .",

    "the qualitative features of the phase diagram are quite similar to those discussed in sec .",

    "in particular , the crossover from the bulk regime to the strongly - localized superconducting dw regime is controlled by @xmath139 .",
