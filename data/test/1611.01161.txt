    "lyman - alpha ( ly@xmath0 ) is the strongest emission line in the universe and is frequently used to study the highest redshifts ( for reviews , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the resonant nature of the ly@xmath0line complicates studies of galaxies as ly@xmath0observables do not directly connect to intrinsic properties of the gas .",
    "these complications also carry great potential for the study of ly@xmath0emitting systems : at every scattering event the frequency of the ly@xmath0photon is shifted slightly depending on the temperature and velocity of the surrounding . as a consequence , information about the density and velocity fields of the gas is encrypted in the observed ly@xmath0spectrum .",
    "curiously , observed ly@xmath0spectra can be modeled quite successfully with very simple , homogeneous geometries such as an expanding , spherical shell ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where s more complex , multiphase geometries have difficulties in reproducing , for instance , the pronounced double peaked ly@xmath0spectra commonly observed .",
    "this holds true for both simplified models of multiphase structure and for more sophisticated models such as snapshots from cosmological simulations ( see   [ sec : implications ] and @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "this is surprising considering that the interstellar and circumgalactic medium are well - known to be multi - phase  which suggests that ` clumpy ' geometries are closer to reality than the homogeneous ones . in any case",
    ", the mismatch motivates us to revisit of the subject of resonant radiative transfer ( rt ) in multiphase geometries .",
    "previous studies on this subject have focused on ` moderately clumpy media ' , that is , on average a few clumps per sightline .",
    "however , observations of quasar absorption spectra suggest the presence of a large amount of tiny ( @xmath1pc ) clumps in a variety of astrophysical systems ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "similar conclusions hold for large - scale quasar outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and bal regions around agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these observations translate to models which contain orders of magnitude more ( much smaller ) clumps per sightline than has previously been studied in the context of resonant line transfer .    in this letter",
    ", we show that ly@xmath0photons behave fundamentally differently in an environment with such extreme clumping than in other multiphase geometries .",
    "this alleviates ( and possibly eliminates ) the tensions between observed and modelled ly@xmath0spectra discussed above .",
    "in this section , we first describe some basic concepts of ly@xmath0rt in static homogeneous and clumpy media ( in   [ sec : lya - rt_homogeneous_medium ] and   [ sec : lya - rt_clumpy_medium ] , respectively ) .",
    "then we show that under certain circumstances ly@xmath0rt in a clumpy medium might behave the way it does in a homogeneous medium . and",
    "lastly ( in   [ sec : bound - betw - clumpy ] ) , we derive the conditions of this transition .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] shows a visual summary of this section .",
    "we express the frequency @xmath2 in units of doppler shifts from line center ( i.e. , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the line - center frequency and the thermal line width , respectively ) and the voigt parameter as @xmath6 in which @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , we write the scattering cross section simply as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the voigt function which can be approximated in the wing of the line ( @xmath11 ) to be @xmath12 .",
    "the geometry we consider is a semi - infinite slab of height @xmath13 and total line - center optical depth @xmath14 ( between the half - height and surface of the slab ) .",
    "ly@xmath0rt in homogeneous medium has been studied for decades .",
    "the mean free path of ly@xmath0 photons at line center is very small , which forces photons to scatter frequently before escaping .",
    "each scattering event changes the frequency of the photon due to random thermal motions of the hydrogen atoms . on rare occasions scattering",
    "occurs off a hydrogen atom far in the tail of the maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "a ly@xmath0 photon that gets scattered to @xmath15 can escape from a medium with @xmath16 in a single flight .",
    "the time spent scattering is small and the escape time is of order the light crossing time @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the speed of light .    for extremely opaque media ,",
    "escape in single flight is not possible because the damping wings of the voigt profile remain optically thick .",
    "we can estimate when this happens by recalling that boundary between the line core and wings is @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the wings become optically thick when @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 , or @xmath22 for @xmath23k .",
    "ly@xmath0 scattering in the wing of the line profile ( @xmath24 ) changes the frequency by an average amount @xmath25 with an r.m.s .",
    "@xmath26 @xcite . for a photon at some frequency",
    "far in the wing , @xmath27 , it therefore takes @xmath28 scattering events to return to the line core , during which the photon traverses a distance @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the mean free path at frequency @xmath27 .",
    "this sequence of wing scattering events is called an ` excursion ' .",
    "we can write @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the mean free path at line centre .",
    "a photon can escape when @xmath33 , i.e. when @xmath34 , which yields a characteristic frequency for escape ( adams 1972 , harrington 1973 , neufeld 1990 ) , @xmath35 : @xmath36 at @xmath37 it is harder to escape in an excursion , while it is increasingly unlikely for photons to scatter to frequencies @xmath38 .",
    "the spectrum of emerging photons therefore peaks at @xmath35 .",
    "the escape time is : @xmath39    the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] illustrates the escape path in a homogeneous medium .",
    "initially , a large number of scattering events ( @xmath40 ) lead to practically no displacement from the emission site .",
    "then , the photon s frequency shifts to @xmath41 and it can escape easily ( in @xmath42 scatters ) .      for this case , we consider a slab filled with spherical clumps with radius @xmath43 , gas temperature @xmath44 and neutral hydrogen column density @xmath45 ( measured from the center to the boundary of the sphere ) .",
    "we characterize the number density of clumps in the slab by the covering factor @xmath46which denotes the number of clumps intercepted by a sightline orthogonal to the slab s surface between the half - height and the boundary of the slab . in this setup ,",
    "such a sightline will intercept a column density of @xmath47 where the @xmath48 is a geometrical factor .",
    "furthermore , we only consider the case of optically thick clumps without any ` holes ' in the setup ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we will drop these constraints and consider the general case in @xcite .",
    "previous work showed that given this geometry , ly@xmath0photons emitted ( at line center ) in the midplane of the slab escape by scattering off the clumps surfaces and slowly diffusing outwards @xcite . in this picture",
    "( sometimes referred to as ` surface scatter approximation ' ) , the clumps are optically thick to ly@xmath0 photons throughout the scattering process .",
    "thus , the photons random walk between the clumps , which leads to @xmath50 clump interactions ( shown in the central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) . here , the mean free path between clump interactions is simply the mean clump separation @xmath51 . as a result ,",
    "the escape time is given by @xmath52    importantly , the trapping time depends on the number of scatters in the single longest excursion (  [ sec : lya - rt_homogeneous_medium ] ) or between clouds (  [ sec : lya - rt_clumpy_medium ] ) , _ not _ the total number of scatters .",
    "for instance , for a very optically thick medium , @xcite found that it takes @xmath40 core scattering events to be first scattered to @xmath53 , something that has been reproduced with monte - carlo simulations ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is vastly larger than the number of scatters @xmath54 we have invoked during an excursion .",
    "however , the mean free path associated with core scatters is small , @xmath55 , so the time spent performing core scatters @xmath56 is much less than the time @xmath57 spent on the excursion ( equation  ) . similarly , in a clumpy medium , the time spent on surface scatters is @xmath58 times longer than on core scattering .",
    "thus , under certain conditions photons can scatter substantially within a single cloud @xmath59 , but they still spend most of their time in a random walk in the inter - cloud medium .      consider a photon emitted at line center .",
    "there are essentially two modes of escape .",
    "if it remains largely confined to the doppler core @xmath60 , then it can escape by scattering off the clump surfaces , which act as mirrors , with an escape time given by equation  .",
    "such photons have a peak at line center . on the other hand ,",
    "as it scatters , the photon random walks in frequency as well .",
    "it can also potentially escape via its longest frequency excursion ; the spectrum of such photons peak at @xmath61 .",
    "both of these escape routes operate simultaneously",
    ". the corresponding relative flux of the central and off - center peaks in the spectrum is proportional to the relative escape rates , i.e. @xmath62 . the flux ratios can also be interpreted as the relative probability that a photon will escape via one of these routes .",
    "the boundary between these regimes , when both have comparable fluxes , arises when @xmath63 , or for a covering fraction : @xmath64 here , the upper and lower expression is valid for the wing and core dominated regime , respectively .",
    "the escape time and hence @xmath65 is independent of @xmath66 in the doppler core dominated regime , when the photon escapes in a single flight .",
    "we evaluate the numerical value by demanding continuity at @xmath67",
    ".    one can also understand this result by comparing the photon mean free paths @xmath68 . since @xmath69 [ @xmath70 for surface scatters [ frequency excursion ] , @xmath71 for these two processes .",
    "frequency excursions dominate the spatial diffusion of photons once @xmath72 , i.e. the mean free path during frequency excursions is larger than the mean spacing between clumps .",
    "this is only possible if the clumps are optically thin at @xmath35 . from @xmath73 ,",
    "this is indeed the case : @xmath74 this makes sense : once clumps become optically thin , then the discretization of cold gas into distinct clumps is immaterial : rt is wholly determined by the cumulative intercepted column density . as the dense clumps morph from reflecting mirrors to translucent windows , a continuum approximation becomes accurate , and the fog of cloudlets is indistinguishable from a continuous medium with the same optical depth profile .",
    "in other words , _ @xmath75marks the transition where multiphase ( clumpy ) media affect ly@xmath0 photons as if the medium were perfectly homogeneous .",
    "_ importantly , numerically @xmath75is small enough that we expect to hit this limit frequently in astrophysically realistic environments .",
    "in the reminder of this _ letter _ , we investigate the transition using monte - carlo rt simulations .     and",
    "@xmath76 axis denote the total column density and the average number of clumps per sightline , respectively .",
    "the color coding shows the ratio between the flux at line center and the peak value .",
    "we also mark the @xmath77 value with a solid line and our theoretical estimate from equation   with a dashed line .",
    "the dotted line marks the clump column density as predicted by shattering @xcite ]    .",
    "[ fig : result_overview ]    [ fig : outflows ]",
    "we solve the ly@xmath0rt problem in clumpy media ( discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytical - estimates ] ) numerically using the monte carlo rt code ` tlac ` @xcite .",
    "we use the same setup as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytical - estimates ] in which we fix @xmath23k , and @xmath78pc .",
    "the two main parameters that affect the rt are ( _ i _ ) the clump column density , @xmath79 , which we vary from @xmath80 to @xmath81 , and ( _ ii _ ) the covering factor , @xmath46 , which we vary from @xmath82 to @xmath83 . in agreement with @xcite",
    ", we find no separate further dependence on clump size once these parameters are specified .",
    "[ fig : spectra_n_hi_total ] shows the ly@xmath0spectra emerging from a clumpy medium with fixed total column density @xmath84 , but for different covering factors @xmath46ranging from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "one can clearly see the transformation of the spectrum with increasing @xmath46from a single peak ( with extended wings ; see * ? ? ? * for details ) , to a double peak with relatively high flux at line center , to a double peak with no flux at line center .",
    "the latter is identical to the spectrum one obtains from a homogeneously filled slab with equivalent column density ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_n_hi_total ] as a _ grey line _ ) .",
    "the transition from a single to a double peaked spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_n_hi_total ] can be quantified by the ratio of the flux at line center and at the peak , i.e. , @xmath87 . for low @xmath46 ,",
    "escape proceeds via surface scatterings , and the spectrum is single peaked ( at line center ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath88 for surface scattering .",
    "in contrast , for high @xmath46escape proceeds via damping wing excursions , which gives rise to classical double peaked spectra with low flux at line center .",
    "the ratio @xmath89 for escape in an excursion .",
    "[ fig : result_overview ] shows the same flux ratio ( @xmath87 ) through color coding for a range of different total column densities @xmath90 , and covering factors @xmath46 .",
    "bright colors correspond to single peaked spectra , while dark colors correspond to pronounced double peaked spectra .",
    "one can read off from fig .",
    "[ fig : result_overview ] that for a clump column density of @xmath91 ( the value predicted by shattering ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the spectrum is single peaked below @xmath92 . for increasing @xmath46it transitions to a double peaked spectrum with low flux at line center at @xmath93 .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : result_overview ] also shows the analytical estimate from equation   for the transition value @xmath75(dashed line ) which gives a good fit to the @xmath94 value ( solid contour ) .",
    "the main important feature is that @xmath95 is _",
    "small_. for instance , ly@xmath0rt among clumps possessing a hydrogen column density of @xmath96 behaves as inside a homogeneous medium , where @xmath97 is the hi fraction in the optically thin photosphere , and @xmath98 . ]",
    "if @xmath99 ( as this implies @xmath100 ) .",
    "thus , for hi column densities typical of galaxies , a fog of cloudlets is indistinguishable from a homogeneous slab , from the point of view of ly@xmath0 rt , explaining why this seemingly oversimplified model is often such a good fit to observations .",
    "+ this convergence towards the homogeneous slab for @xmath101 is not only true in the static case . fig .",
    "[ fig : outflows ] shows several examples of spectra from slabs with outflows .",
    "specifically , we introduced a linear scaling between @xmath102 at the half - height to @xmath103 at the boundaries of the slab . in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : outflows ] we show spectra from clumpy media with different values of @xmath46and compare them to the spectra from a homogeneously filled slab with the same kinematics and total column densities ( black dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : outflows ] ) .",
    "the spectra for @xmath104 match the homogeneous spectra very well even for large outflow velocities .",
    "this result implies that observed spectra which can be reproduced using homogeneous media and a ( complex ) velocity structure can also be interpreted in the light of many tiny clumps moving with this velocity .",
    "the latter interpretation is more reasonable considering the high ( super - sonic ) velocities often invoked ( through unusually large doppler parameters ) when modelling ly@xmath0spectra .",
    "these occur more naturally in a ` fog ' since the clumps are comoving with the hot gas of the medium @xcite , and would be hard to understand otherwise since cold gas should be destroyed by shear driven instabilities .",
    "our results show that ly@xmath0spectra emerging from multiphase media with large covering factors match those emerging from homogeneous media .",
    "we identified analytically that this transition between the two rt regimes occurs at @xmath75as given by equation  .",
    "this result potentially offers natural explanations to the puzzling mismatches between observed ly@xmath0spectra and the ones from simplified or low - resolution hydrodynamic multiphase models discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "while observed ly@xmath0spectra show a variety of characteristics , there are several common features .",
    "one example of a common feature is that the vast majority of all spectra are shifted redwards and are asymmetric with a stronger red than blue component @xcite .",
    "there are roughly as many single- as double peaked spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and observations indicate that the flux in the ` valley ' between the peaks is small @xcite . in addition , the peaks themselves commonly show an asymmetry with extended wings ; another feature which points towards strong , systematic rt effects .",
    "a successful model has to be able to reproduce these observations : the consistent asymmetry of the spectral line , and if double - peaked , the low flux in the valley .",
    "+ models for ly@xmath0 transfer through multiphase media have not yet matched all of these constraints .",
    "the hot , ionized phase provides low-@xmath105 channels through which a significant fraction of the flux can escape .",
    "this applies both to simplified clumpy models with low @xmath46@xcite , and to snapshots from hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which typically have @xmath106pc resolution  not enough to resolve the shattering process @xcite . as a consequence , hydrodynamical simulations",
    "likely give a too low a value for @xmath46for any given total hi column density , which then generally gives rise to ly@xmath0 spectra which possess a too large flux at line center and / or do not show sufficient asymmetries .",
    "+ our results hint that _ if _ astrophysical systems do indeed possess similar small - scale structures , that these affect ly@xmath0photons in a way that more closely resembles a homogeneous medium .",
    "this may provide some new insights into the success of the ` shell - model ' , though this needs to made more quantitative .",
    "an additional advantage of this interpretation of this shell - model , is that it may alleviate potential problems with the values inferred by ` shell - model fitting ' .",
    "examples include unnaturally large doppler parameters @xmath107 , and/or intrinsic spectra which are wider than their h@xmath0 counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the former ( as well as highly supersonic expansion ) can be explained if the cold clumps are comoving with the hot gas , and the latter could hint at rt effects prior to scattering through the multiphase outflow .",
    "we will explore complications such as bulk flows , turbulence , and dust in more detail in future work .",
