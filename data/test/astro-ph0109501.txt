    "the present universe shows a variety of structures .",
    "how such a structure is formed in the evolution of the universe .",
    "one of the most plausible explanations is that the nonlinear dynamics of a self - gravitating system provides such a scale - free structure during the evolution of the universe . in order to clarify whether such a dynamics really gives an appropriate observed feature , we have so far three approaches : @xmath0-body simulation , the eulerian perturbation approach and the lagrangian one .",
    "although the final answer for a structure formation would be obtained by the @xmath0-body simulation , it may be difficult to obtain enough resolution to discuss a fine structure of the universe such as a scaling property .",
    "as for a perturbation approach , however , it is just an approximation and will break down in a nonlinear regime , although the lagrangian approach would be better if we are interested in density perturbations .",
    "this is just because a density fluctuation @xmath1 and a peculiar velocity @xmath2 are perturbed quantities in the eulerian approach@xcite , while a displacement of particles from uniform distribution is assumed to be small in the lagrangian approach@xcite .",
    "its first order solution is the so - called zeldovich approximation ( za ) @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian approach is confirmed to be better than the eulerian approach by comparison of exact solutions in several cases@xcite .",
    "therefore , we will adopt the lagrangian approximation in this paper and discuss about how to improve it .",
    "in the standard approach of newtonian cosmology , the global cosmological parameters such as hubble expansion rate and mean density are given first by a solution of the einstein equations , i.e. the so - called friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , which is an isotropic and homogeneous spacetime . according to observation",
    ", however , a local structure in the universe is definitely not homogeneous and isotropic@xcite . in the standard approach ,",
    "the density averaged over the whole space ( or a horizon scale ) is assumed to be the energy density of the frw spacetime .",
    "however , here the problems of how to average inhomogeneous matter fluid and how to define an averaged isotropic and homogeneous spacetime are arisen .",
    "this problem has been discussed in the framework of newtonian cosmology and general relativity by many authors @xcite .",
    "the most important point to discuss is how inhomogeneities affect the expansion law of the universe and whether such a backreaction affects the evolution of the density perturbations .",
    "this is our subject to discuss in this paper .",
    "although many authors proposed different methods of averaging procedure in general relativity @xcite , a serious problem remains .",
    "different gauge choices make the problem more complicated .",
    "since a relativistic effect may not be so important , in this paper , in order to avoid such a difficulty , we discuss only an averaging procedure in the newtonian framework . proposing a averaging procedure , which is defined by spatial average of physical quantities , buchert and ehlers lead the averaged raychaudhuri s equation@xcite . the equation describes how the averaged expansion rate of domain with a finite volume evolves .",
    "this equation has an additional term , which we call a backreaction term of inhomogeneities on averaged expansion . then , buchert , kerscher , and sicka estimated the backreaction term using the conventional lagrangian perturbation approach@xcite .",
    "they first consider density perturbations in einstein - de sitter ( e - ds ) universe , then calculated the backreaction term and solved the averaged raychaudhuri s equation .",
    "they showed difference between a cosmological parameter such as hubble expansion rate in their averaged model and that of the e - ds model .",
    "although they included a backreaction term to estimate the averaged variables in a local domain , they used the perturbed quantities from the e - ds universe .",
    "in other words , they have not take into account a backreaction on the evolution of density perturbations .    here",
    "we improve their approach , i.e. we include a backreaction effect to averaged expansion rate and solve the averaged raychaudhuri s equation ( the generalized friedmann s equation ) with evolution equation of perturbations in the averaged domain . in an averaged domain ,",
    "the averaged density is either higher or lower than that of the e - ds universe .",
    "this difference will change the evolution of density perturbations .",
    "in fact , if the domain is overdense , growth rate of perturbations behaves as that in the closed universe , while , if it is underdense , it is just like a solution in the open universe .    this paper is organized as follows : in @xmath3 , we shortly derive the generalized friedmann equation , following ehlers and buchert , and estimate a backreaction term .",
    "we present our formalism in @xmath4 .",
    "we show some relation between two lagrangian descriptions ( the conventional one and ours ) and give our initial setting in  .",
    "4 . in  5 , we analyze a simple example , i.e . a plane - symmetric one - dimensional model , to show the probability distribution of the observed quantities such as hubble parameter , or density fluctuation , or peculiar velocity .",
    "the conclusion and discussion follow in @xmath5 .",
    "in the newtonian cosmology , the expansion of a domain is influenced by inhomogeneity inside the domain .",
    "such an effect may be evaluated by spatial integration of field variables in the lagrangian domain , which evolves with matter fluid . hence in this paper",
    "we study fields averaged over a simply - connected spatial lagrangian domain @xmath6 at time @xmath7 , which evolved out of the initial domain @xmath8 at time @xmath9 .",
    "the locally averaged scale factor @xmath10 , depending on the content , shape and location of the domain @xmath6 , is defined by the volume of domain @xmath11 and its initial volume @xmath12 as @xmath13    we define a spatial averaging for any rank tensor field @xmath14 by the volume integral normalized by the volume of the domain as @xmath15 the average density is then given by @xmath16 where the total mass @xmath17 for a domain @xmath6 is conserved . using this averaging",
    ", we can derive the generalized friedmann equation@xcite , which we will shortly derive here .",
    "we start from the hydrodynamic equations for a self - gravitating perfect fluid ; @xmath18 although it is easy to extend the case with pressure of fluid , we consider just dust matter and ignore a pressure term .",
    "to discuss inhomogeneity , a spatial derivative of field will play a crucial role .",
    "in particular , it turns out that the spatial derivative of velocity * u * , which is divided into three variables as @xmath19 is very important , where @xmath20 the magnitudes of shear @xmath21 and of rotation @xmath22 are defined by @xmath23 using these variables , we find the basic equations for density , shear and rotation from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : conti - eq ] ) , ( [ eqn : euler - eq ] ) as @xmath24    the volume of a spatial domain @xmath25 described by its initial domain @xmath8 through a transformation from the eulerian coordinates @xmath26 to the lagrangian one @xmath27 as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the jacobian of the transformation @xmath30 the change rate of the volume of a domain is then given as @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the lagrangian time derivative .",
    "since @xmath33 is the averaged volume expansion rate of the domain @xmath6 , it may be natural to define the effective hubble expansion rate of the domain @xmath6 by @xmath34 . from the definition of the volume @xmath35",
    ", we find @xmath36 .    the lagrangian time derivative does not commute with spatial averaging . for an arbitrary tensor field @xmath37 ,",
    "ehlers and buchert showed the commutation rule : @xmath38    applying this commutation rule to the basic equations , we find @xmath39 replacing @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : theta_evolution ] ) with @xmath41 , we find the averaged raychaudhuri s equation @xmath42 where @xmath43 describes the backreaction due to inhomogeneity of the universe . for @xmath44 case , the equation becomes the conventional friedmann equation with a scale factor @xmath45 for homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "this is regarded as the generalized friedmann equation .      in order to evaluate the back reaction term @xmath46",
    ", it may be convenient to introduce three principal scalar invariants as follows : for 2-rank tensor field @xmath47   in cartesian coordinates , those are defined by @xmath48 in particular , for the velocity gradient of matter fluid  @xmath49  , we find @xmath50 where we have used the following relations @xmath51    using those invariants , we can describe @xmath46 as @xmath52    in the following discussion , we will use the lagrangian description .",
    "then , it will be convenient to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eqn : qdineuler ] ) by the lagrangian variables .",
    "the lagrangian domain is just the initial domain @xmath8 .",
    "the spatial average of a tensor field @xmath53 is described by the lagrangian coordinates as @xmath54 where the lagrangian average @xmath55 is defined by @xmath56 using this relation , the backreaction term is described by the volume average in the lagrangian domain @xmath8 as @xmath57    so far , we have not made any approximation .",
    "however , when we evaluate those invariants explicitly , we need a further ansatz . here",
    "we adopt a perturbation method . in the conventional perturbation approach ,",
    "we expand the variables around the background friedmann universe .",
    "in fact , buchert , kerscher , and sicka evaluated the backreaction term @xmath46 by this perturbation method@xcite , which we will show in the next section .",
    "we have also another possibility to divide a perturbed part from a uniform background part as follows : since we average the variables in some domain and take into account its backreaction effect , we can adopt the averaged variables as unperturbed parts . this way to extract",
    "the perturbed parts seems to be more consistent and may provide some difference from the previous approach by buchert et al .",
    "we will discuss the detail next .",
    "the conventional lagrangian approximation ( for example , za @xcite ) was constructed in a homogeneous and isotropic universe . however , when a nonlinear structure is formed , it is not so clear what is the background universe and how to divide the perturbed part from the unperturbed one .",
    "although the simplest way is the conventional approach , as we discussed in previous section , a local expansion rate of the universe in some finite domain will be affected by its inhomogeneity",
    ". then the growth rate of density fluctuations may also be affected by the inhomogeneity .",
    "we shall derive the consistent equations for the lagrangian perturbations with the backreaction term @xmath46 .",
    "first , we introduce the  comoving \" eulerian coordinates @xmath58 and peculiar velocity @xmath59 as @xmath60 in the conventional lagrangian perturbation approach , we set @xmath61 where @xmath62 is just a scale factor of the background hubble flow of the whole universe and satisfies the friedmann equation .",
    "however , because of the above reason , the expansion of a domain @xmath6 may be described by @xmath10 .",
    "hence , we have not fixed a scale factor @xmath63 yet .",
    "it will be determined later by adding a further ansatz .    with the relations @xmath64",
    "the basic equations ( [ eqn : conti - eq])-([eqn : poisson - eq2 ] ) with @xmath65 are rewritten as @xmath66 where the density @xmath67 is divided into an unperturbed uniform part @xmath68 , which is defined by the mass conservation @xmath69= constant , and its fluctuation @xmath1 defined by @xmath70 @xmath71 is the gravitational potential defined by @xmath72 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : euler1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : poisson1 ] ) , we obtain the following equation : @xmath73 if we specify @xmath63 , this equation provides the equation for inhomogeneous part subtracted a background uniform expansion . for example , in the conventional lagrangian approximation , @xmath63 is taken to be a scale factor of the frw universe @xmath62 , which satisfies the friedmann equation @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the mean energy density of the universe .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath63 is chosen to be @xmath10 , which evolution is given by the averaged raychaudhuri s equation ( [ eqn : g - friedmann ] ) , the perturbation equations are modified because of the backreaction effect @xmath46 as @xmath76 where the variables with subscript @xmath6 are defined those with the scale factor @xmath10 and @xmath77 .    the rotation of ( [ eqn : euler1 ] ) yields @xmath78    now we will describe those equations in terms of the lagrangian coordinates . using the lagrangian time derivative along the fluid flow @xmath79 eqs . ( [ eqn : evolution2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : rot ] ) are rewritten as @xmath80 where we have introduced @xmath81 , which is zero for the conventional lagrangian approach without backreaction but is chosen to be @xmath46 when we include the backreaction due to inhomogeneity .",
    "note that there are still some space to estimate this backreaction term depending on a choice of the background scale factor @xmath63 .",

    "especially , if the size of a domain is smaller , the difference gets larger . on the other hand , the probability to find an overdense region ( @xmath187 ) decreases in our approximation",
    "the reason is very simple : during evolution , an overdense region shrinks and a nonlinear structure is formed as the zeldovich s pancake . on the other hand ,",
    "an underdense region expands .",
    "therefore , although the initial volumes of overdense underdense regions are the same , the volume of the latter gets larger than that of the former in a nonlinear stage .",

    "the origin of this result could be understood by nonlinearity of gravity . in the case of one - dimensional plane - symmetric system in the conventional lagrangian approximation ( in fact",
    ", the za is exact ) , we do not find any non - gaussian structure .",
    "however , even in the za , the pdf shows non - gaussian behavior in the case of three - dimensional case@xcite .",
    "if we take into account our backreaction effect , does non - gaussian behavior emerge even in one - dimensional case ?",
    "the pairwise peculiar velocity is defined as follows : @xmath191 where @xmath192 and @xmath193 represent components parallel and perpendicular to @xmath194 , respectively . in a plane - symmetric case",
    ", @xmath195 only appears .",
    "hereafter we write this by @xmath196 .",
    "if matter distribution is clustering , @xmath196 is expected to be negative .",
    "giving initial data by random gaussian , the pdf of a pairwise peculiar velocity is gaussian at initial time . during evolution ,",
    "the pdf will deviate from gaussian .",
    "in fact , from fig.[fig : pdf - pv ] , which shows the pdf of a peculiar velocity in nonlinear regime , we find that it is not gaussian and approaches an exponential form in a small velocity region . as a reference , we show that the pdf for the za , which shows a gaussian form . the reason may be understood as follows : in a plane - symmetric model , gravitational potential is proportional to a distance between two sheets ( @xmath197 ) . then",
    ", even if two sheets approaches very closely , a gravitational force does not become strong but keep constant .",
    "when we take into account a backreaction effect , however , a gravitational force will be strong in a clustering region , because the expansion rate of a local domain is slow down .",
    "the strengthening of a gravitational force in a cluster region may make a deviation of the pdf of pairwise peculiar velocity from its gaussian form .",
    "note that in the 3d system , which shows non - gaussian pdf , a gravitational force increases when two particles approach .",
    "another interesting observable variable is a deceleration parameter .",
    "the recent observation of type ia supernova may suggest an acceleration of the universe@xcite .",
    "although this result may naively suggest an existence of dark energy such as a cosmological constant @xmath199 , we could find some effective model without dark energy which explain the observation .",
    "then we shall estimate a deceleration parameter averaged in a local domain here .",
    "we define local deceleration parameter @xmath157 as @xmath200 which can be evaluated by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g - friedmann ] ) and @xmath201 .",
    "buchert et al@xcite showed the evolution of deceleration parameter for the za .",
    "they picked up overdense and underdense regions of three-@xmath21 fluctuations and found that @xmath157 for an underdense region could be a present day value , which is smaller by more than 200% than that of the background e - ds universe , although such a region is still decelerating .",
    "although our approach includes a backreaction consistently , our analysis shows that a deviation of @xmath157 does not get so large .",
    "the difference of @xmath157 from the za is very little even just before the shell crossing .",
    "we show the time evolution of @xmath157 for a plane - symmetric 1-dimensional model in fig .",
    "[ fig : qd - evolv ] . even if a domain is extremely underdense , the domain is decelerating .",
    "this may be because our approach is still perturbative .",
    "we will discuss it further in the next section .",
    "we propose new lagrangian perturbation theory with a backreaction effect by inhomogeneity of density perturbations and present a set of basic equations .",
    "the inhomogeneity affects the expansion rate in a local domain and its own growing rate . in a one - dimensional plane - symmetric model ,",
    "we have numerically analyzed our approach , and calculated the growing rate density perturbations and the pdf of several observed variables .",
    "we set our initial conditions as random gaussian distribution . from our analysis",
    ", we show that the expansion rate of an overdense region is faster than that of the whole universe as expected .",
    "we also show that the local hubble parameter may deviate from the global one by about 1.2 % for a @xmath184-grid domain",
    ". it may be too small to distinguish its effect in the present observations@xcite , but it could become important in fully non - linear stage , which we can not describe in the present approach .",
    "the pdf of density is slightly different from that of the za . in our model ,",
    "an underdense region expands faster than that in the e - ds model and then its volume gets larger . hence , a probability for a negative @xmath1 region increases as seen in the pdf . as for a peculiar velocity ,",
    "even if we take into account a backreaction , its pdf is still gaussian .",
    "the pdf of pairwise peculiar velocity , however , shows an effective difference from the conventional lagrangian approach . in one - dimensional plane symmetric case ,",
    "the pdf in the conventional lagrangian approximation ( the za ) is gaussian , but ours is not but approaches an exponential form in a small relative - velocity region , which agree with the n - body simulation and the 3d lagrangian approximation@xcite .",
    "finally , we mention about recent observation about cosmological parameters . according to the observation of type ia supernova",
    ", the expansion of the universe seems to accelerate@xcite . combining observation of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) ,",
    "the result suggests existence of dark energy such as a cosmological constant @xmath199@xcite .",
    "however , this produces another difficulty , that is the so - called cosmological constant problem . to avoid such a difficulty , if we could explain the observation without cosmological constant , it would be more natural .",
    "recently , tomita discussed such possibility assuming we are in a large local void@xcite .",
    "globally the universe is flat ( eds universe ) , but we are sitting near the center of a local void , which existence is observationally confirmed .",
    "then he calculated the luminosity distance , finding that the observation can be explain by such a model .",
    "we then wonder whether we could have the similar explanation if we are living in an effective void , which is a domain with an averaged energy density below the critical value . since we have to treat a strongly nonlinear structure to explain the observation , this is beyond our present approach .",
    "however there is some indication . if we analyze the time dependence of the backreaction term @xmath46 , which evolves as @xmath202 in a linear perturbation level .",
    "this time dependence is the same as a perfect fluid with the equation of state @xmath203 , which could be dark energy .",
    "if we could explain the above observation without introduction of any strange matter but just by inhomogeneity of density distribution in the universe , we will have a natural understanding of the universe .",
    "this is under investigation .",
    "in addition , there are two further approaches which are related to the present work .",
    "takada and futamase@xcite proposed that they divided lagrangian perturbation to large - scale and small - scale perturbations , then discussed interaction between those scales .",
    "taruya and soda@xcite discussed dynamics of averaged variables in the case of a spherical infall model taking into account a backreaction effect .",
    "since those are interesting approaches , it may be useful to use their approaches to discuss the present subject and compare those results with ours in future",
