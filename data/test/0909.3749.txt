    "this result reflects the intuitive argument discussed at the beginning of this section : the inertia @xmath197 of the charge dynamics is provided by the chain itself .",
    "moreover , it is given by @xmath163 times the nonlinear inductance @xmath198 of a single junction in the chain .",
    "this means that @xmath197 can be tuned in principle , either by tuning @xmath163 or by using squid loops instead of single junctions as in  @xcite , such that @xmath7 can be tuned with a magnetic flux .",
    "we also note that the critical voltage of a josephson junction chain is @xmath163 times larger than the one of a single josephson junction .",
    "this is relevant for the discussion in the next section , where we will analyze the @xmath199-@xmath200 characteristic of a phase - slip junction under microwave irradiation .",
    "as the width of the appearing current steps scales with the critical voltage of the phase - slip junction , a josephson junction chain has necessarily larger current - steps that are as a consequence more robust against voltage noise .",
    "as it was already mentioned in the introduction , it is of interest to study the behavior of phase - slip junctions under the influence of microwaves . in view of duality",
    ", we expect the current - voltage characteristics to exhibit steps at well - defined values of the current that are multiples of the microwave frequency , so - called current shapiro steps . in order to demonstrate this",
    ", we have numerically integrated eq .",
    "( [ cjrl ] ) in the classical limit .",
    "we set @xmath201 , and ignore the effect of fluctuations .",

    "[ overdamped]a , the current remains zero as long as the voltage @xmath200 is smaller than the critical voltage @xmath19 : the phase - slip junction is in the coulomb blockade regime . beyond @xmath19 ,",
    "the current rapidly increases until it reaches the linear asymptote @xmath207 , where the junction is in the superconducting state and the voltage drops entirely over the resistor .",
    "this characteristic corresponds in fact to the so - called bloch nose , which has been studied in the experiment  @xcite in the presence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "it was found that such fluctuations induce a smooth interpolation between the coulomb blockade and the superconducting branch , in agreement with theory  @xcite . in the underdamped situation , fig .",
    "[ underdamped]a , the two branches in the characteristic co - exist in the coulomb blockade region .",
    "since both branches are accessible , we generally expect to find hysteretic behavior of the phase - slip junction .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this limit has not yet been accessed experimentally . the behavior shown in figs .",
    "[ overdamped]a and [ underdamped]a have a dual counterpart in the usual rcsj - model , where both the overdamped and the underdamped limit have been studied in experiments  @xcite .    if microwaves are applied , steps appear at well - defined values of the current that are multiples of the applied mw frequency , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ overdamped]b and [ underdamped]b .",
    "the steps are clearly visible ; they are integrated within the overall @xmath199-@xmath200 characteristic , the average slope of which remains determined by the resistance @xmath3 . in the overdamped case , there is a one - to - one correspondence between current and voltage , as for the case without mw . in fact , the shape of each step in fig .",
    "[ overdamped]b appears to be a replica of the characteristic in the absence of mw , fig .",
    "[ overdamped]a .",
    "the one - to - one correspondence between voltage and current found in the overdamped limit is lost in the underdamped case : various current steps appear within the same voltage interval . in order to obtain the result shown in fig .",
    "[ underdamped]b , eq .",
    "( [ cjrl ] ) had to be integrated for a range of initial conditions on the quasi - charge for each value of the dc voltage @xmath200 .",
    "note that the resistive branch is absent in the regions of overlapping steps ; this is of interest as it possibly makes it easier to lock on a given step in the experiment .",
    "we have studied two circuits , a single josephson junction in an inductive - resistive environment and a josephson junction chain , in view of the realization of the dual of the josephson effect . in both cases",
    "we elucidate the importance of the role of the inductance in order to reduce charge fluctuations .",
    "duality between these two circuits and a single josephson junction is valid in the quantum and classical regime . here , we derived @xmath208 characteristics in the classical quasi - charge regime . in case of larger quasicharge fluctuations going beyong the classical regime",
    ", perturbation theory can be applied in analogy to the @xmath209 theory in josephson junctions governed by phase - dynamics  @xcite .",
    "until now there are only a few experiments dealing with quasi - charge dynamics  @xcite .",
    "we believe that both circuits are experimentally feasible and they are of particular interest in terms of the realization of current shapiro steps .",
    "the successful realization of such an experiment would link the frequency to the current by a quantum electrical recipe and close the metrological triangle .",
    "ultimately , the quantum metrological triangle experiment would enable a consistency check of the fundamental constants of nature , the electron charge @xmath25 and planck s constant @xmath24 , and as a consequence link the kilogram ( the only unit still defined on the basis of one artefact , prototype of the mass kept in metrology institutions ) , to the planck constant .",
    "the circuit based on a single josephson chain seems from our point of view the most promising as it enables to realize large current steps .",
