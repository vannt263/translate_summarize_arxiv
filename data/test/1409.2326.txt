    " sham dft ( ks - dft ) is in principle exact , standard approximate exchange ",
    "correlation functionals usually do not enable an adequate description of multi - configurational systems .",
    "on the other hand , the `` gold standard '' single - reference _ coupled cluster _ ( cc ) method should also be able to model near - degeneracies but high - order excitations would then be necessary . in practice multi - reference ( mr )",

    ", these methods may suffer from the perturbative description of the short - range dynamical correlation which is sometimes not accurate enough . for these reasons",
    "multi - configurational extensions of both dft and cc have been investigated for many years and despite significant efforts and encouraging results , it is still unclear how the incorporation of a _ complete active space self - consistent field _ ( casscf ) into dft and cc should be performed . a recent review article by bartlett and coworkers  @xcite gives an extensive picture of the developments in mrcc .",
    "we shall focus here on dft and restrict ourselves to the description of the ground state .",
    "+ the rigorous combination of casscf with dft is already difficult at the formal level due to the infamous double counting problem .",
    "specific functionals must indeed be developed for complementing the casscf energy that already contains some correlation effects  @xcite .",
    "the latter are usually referred to as static correlation effects . only the complementary correlation , known as dynamical correlation , should therefore be assigned to the density functional .",
    "turning such a scheme into a practical computational method is not an easy task since approximations used for standard functionals can not be applied straightfowardly in this context .",
    "one way to overcome the double counting problem consists in separating correlation effects in the coordinate space , as initially proposed by savin  @xcite .",
    "the resulting range - separated dft methods combine rigorously long - range wft with short - range dft .",
    "even though range separation allows for a multi - configurational description of the electron density , it can not completely isolate static correlation from dynamical correlation simply because the former is usually not a purely long - range effect , even in a dissociated molecule .",
    "this point will be discussed further in the following .",
    "+ let us mention that savin earlier combined configuration interaction ( ci ) with dft by separating correlation effects in the natural orbital space  @xcite",
    ". orbitals with occupation numbers larger than a given threshold @xmath0 were correlated explicitly , at the ci level , while the remaining correlation energy was described with a complementary @xmath0-dependent density functional .",
    "more recently , gutl and savin  @xcite proposed alternative ci - dft schemes where the correlation energy is still split in the orbital space but through the introduction of gap shift or cutoff parameters . in all these hybrid ci - dft schemes , a ci energy is complemented by a functional of the electron density . in this work",
    "we propose to revisit at the formal level the separation of correlation effects in the orbital space . as a major difference with the approaches discussed previously ,",
    "orbitals occupation will be used as basic variable rather than the electron density .",
    "the idea originates from condensed matter physics where strongly correlated electrons are usually described with model hamiltonians ( such as the hubbard hamiltonian ) rather than the true physical one  @xcite . as discussed",
    "further in the following , adapting such an approach to quantum chemistry is appealing since static correlation is usually defined in the orbital space .",
    "molecular orbitals can then be viewed as sites with an occupation to be determined .",
    "as shown in this work , a wft description of static correlation can be combined rigorously with an orbital - occupation functional modeling of dynamical correlation .",
    "a potential drawback of such a scheme lies in the fact that , in contrast to range - separated dft , the complementary functional loses its universality since it depends on the molecular orbitals .",
    "the theory is derived for a particular choice of orbitals , namely those obtained by diagonalizing the non - interacting hamiltonian ( kinetic and nuclear potential energy operators only are considered ) .",
