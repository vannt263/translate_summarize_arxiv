    "the gaia cornerstone mission by esa ( perryman et al . 2001 ) , scheduled for launch around 2010 , will record during its 5-year lifetime an average of @xmath2100 spectra for each of all the stars brighter than @xmath317.5 mag ( @xmath4 objects ) , over the wavelength range 84808740 and at a resolution 10000@xmath5 20000 , corresponding to dispersions 0.22 @xmath6  / pix @xmath6 0.44 in the nyquist fwhm=2  pix sense .",
    "the main aim of such spectra is to support the mission micro - arcsec accurate astrometry with the 6@xmath7 component of the phase - space via determination of the radial velocities .",
    "however , this huge number of spectra will not only provide radial velocities but will also carry the whole usual astrophysical content ( munari 2002 ) , which will be pretty large given the adopted high spectral resolution and the diagnostic potential of this wavelength region dominated by the caii triplet , the head of the paschen series , multiplet # 1 and # 8 of ni , and a forest of fei , tii lines and of many other metals",
    ".    the study of the cool component of symbiotic stars will particularly benefit from the choice of this wavelength region for the gaia mission , as much as the spectral observations performed from the ground ( cf .",
    "marrese et al . , this volume ) .",
    "in fact , the 84808740   region is the only astrophysically relevant wavelength interval longward of h@xmath8 free from telluric absorption interference ( cf .",
    "munari 1999 ) , and is within the reach of many of the currently available high - resolution spectrographs .",
    "we have identified and calibrated , over this wavelength interval , a family of diagnostic line ratios that provide good estimate of temperature ( spectral type ) and surface gravity ( luminosity ) .",
    "the whole set of ratios will be described elsewhere , with only a sample of them presented here .",
    "other diagnostic ratios have been presented by munari ( 2002 ) .",
    "the line ratios have been investigated on the available high - resolution spectral atlases in this region , both observational ( munari and tomasella 1999 ) and synthetic ( munari and castelli 2000 , castelli and munari 2001 ) ones .",
    "the relations here presented come entirely from observational material , mainly referring to mkk standards ( thus bright , solar neighborhood stars ) .",
    "figure  1 presents temperature ( spectral type ) sensitive indicators for supergiant , giant and dwarf cool stars , built on the ratio of equivalent widths . to _",
    "blend 8680 _ contribute mainly lines of fei ( 8679.638 ) , si ( 8678.927 , 8679.620 , 8680.411 ) and ni ( 8680.282 ) , and the extremes for equivalent width integration extends from 8678.0 to 8681.6  .",
    "the extremes for caii  8542 extend from 8522.0 to 8565.0  , to fully cover the line wings ( even if including several weak metallic lines ) .",
    "those for fei  8675 go from 8673.0 to 8676.5 , for tii  8683 from 8681.6 to 8684.0 , for fei  8688 from 8688.5 to 8690.5  .",
    "figure  2 offers surface gravity ( luminosity class ) sensitive indicators for supergiant , giant and dwarf cool stars , built on the ratio of equivalent widths .",
    "the extremes for equivalent width integration of fei  8688 and fei  8675 are the same for in figure  1 , while for tii+mgi  8735 it is 8734.38737.7 , for sii+fei  8728 is 8726.78729.5 , for fei  8514 is 8512.58515.8 and for tii  8518 it is 8516.68519.6  .",
