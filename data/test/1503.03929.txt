    "one of the most important diagnostics in understanding the evolution of galaxies is the star - formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "the evolution of the sfr of galaxies can give clues as to how galaxies were enriched with heavy elements , how they build up their stellar mass through cosmic time , and helps us to understand the bolometric output of galaxies .",
    "at redshift @xmath7 , when the universe was just @xmath8 3gyr old , star - formation activity in the universe was at its peak and galaxies were in the process of assembling most of their stellar mass ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studying this critical epoch is essential to gaining a better understanding of the evolution of the progenitors of the local galaxy population .    the ultra - violet ( uv ) continuum ( 1500 to 2800 ) intensity of a galaxy is one of the most commonly used diagnostics for the sfr as it is observable over a wide range of redshifts and intrinsic luminosities .",
    "it is sensitive to massive stars ( @xmath9 ) , making it a direct tracer of current sfr . by extrapolating the formation rate of massive stars to lower masses , for an assumed form of the initial mass function ( imf )",
    ", one can estimate the total sfr @xcite .",
    "another widely used diagnostic for measuring the sfr is nebular emission , with h@xmath1 being the most common because of its higher intensity compared to the other hydrogen recombination lines such as h@xmath10 , pa@xmath1 , pa@xmath10 , etc . , and it is easier to interpret than the ly@xmath1 line .",
    "h@xmath1 is an `` instantaneous '' tracer of sfr because it is sensitive only to the most massive stars ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , it becomes more challenging to observe h@xmath1 from the ground at @xmath12 because the line is redshifted to the near - ir where the terrestrial background is much higher than at optical wavelengths .",
    "the main disadvantage of using uv / optical luminosities as tracers of the sfr is their sensitivity to dust attenuation .",
    "the dust absorption cross - section is larger for shorter wavelengths and choosing the appropriate attenuation curve to correct the observed luminosities plays an important role in determining intrinsic physical quantities . aside from the assumed attenuation curve ,",
    "the geometry of dust with respect to the stars can lead to different color excesses , @xmath13 , between the ionized gas and the stellar continuum .",
    "@xmath13 is the color excess measured between the _ b _ and _ v _ bands , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the total extinction at wavelength @xmath16 in magnitudes .",
    "in particular , the nebular recombination lines arise from the hii regions around the most massive o and early - type b stars ( with masses of m@xmath17 and main sequence lifetimes of @xmath18myr ) . on the other hand , for a salpeter imf , solar metallicity , and a constant or rising star - formation history , the uv continuum in starburst galaxies originates from stars over a broader range of mass that includes later - type b stars with lifetimes @xmath19myr @xcite .",
    "these older non - ionizing stars have more time to migrate to regions of lower dust density in the galaxy , while h - ionizing stars with shorter lifetimes do not have enough time to escape from their dusty birthplace or let the parent molecular clouds to dissipate . as a result , the nebular lines can be subject to a higher degree of reddening than the uv continuum .",
    "@xcite found that the nebular emission is more attenuated than the stellar continuum at the same wavelengths for a sample of local uv - bright galaxies .",
    "subsequently , @xcite studied a similar sample of local galaxies and argued that the _ color - excess _ is 2.27 times larger for the nebular emission lines than for the stellar continuum .",
    "this relationship was derived under the assumption that the calzetti curve is applied to the stellar continuum and a galactic extinction curve is applied to the nebular emission lines . in a separate study",
    ", @xcite found that for an sdss sample of @xmath20 galaxies , @xmath21 , both assuming a @xcite extinction curve .",
    "there have been several studies of relative attenuation of the stellar continuum and nebular regions in high - redshift galaxies . in most of the high - redshift studies ,",
    "the calzetti curve is assumed for both the nebular and stellar regions .",
    "frequently , the @xcite relation between the stellar and nebular @xmath13 is used to correct the nebular lines , while this relation was originally derived based on using a galactic extinction curve for the nebular lines . at present",
    "it is unclear what type of attenuation curve should be applied to the nebular regions .",
    "these issues are discussed in detail in @xcite .    at @xmath7",
    ", @xcite selected a sample from various imaging surveys in the optical , near - ir , mid - ir , and sub - millimeter regime , with sed - derived sfrs of @xmath8 10 - 1000 @xmath22 and stellar masses @xmath23 , assuming a chabrier imf . in their study ,",
    "the predicted h@xmath1 luminosities from the best - fit sed models for 62 galaxies were compared with the observed line luminosities measured from integral field spectroscopy .",
    "the latter were then corrected for reddening assuming the @xmath24 returned from stellar population modeling of their galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that assuming a factor of two redder color excess towards the hii regions relative to the stellar continuum yielded the best agreement between the predicted and observed h@xmath1 luminosities .",
    "similarly , @xcite investigated 25 star forming galaxies at @xmath7 and compared the h@xmath1 sfrs , dust - corrected by the calzetti attenuation curve , with the sed modeled sfrs .",
    "they showed that h@xmath1 sfrs are consistent with the sed sfrs , provided that @xmath25 when assuming the calzetti curve for both .",
    "@xcite presented two galaxies at redshifts @xmath26 and 2.024 , and added ten other galaxies at similar redshifts from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to compare a@xmath27 derived from the balmer decrement ( @xmath28 ) with a@xmath29 derived from the sed models , both assuming the calzetti curve .",
    "the only two galaxies with detected h@xmath10 line measurements showed evidence for higher nebular attenuation , but about half of the non - detections were consistent with equal attenuation for the nebular and stellar regions . in @xcite",
    ", h@xmath1 attenuation was investigated through several comparisons for a sample of optically - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "aided with near - infrared spectroscopic observations , @xcite used the balmer decrement along with the calzetti curve to correct the h@xmath1 sfr .",
    "the dust - corrected sfr was then compared with the h@xmath1 sfr corrected by the sed color - excess and also with the sfrs inferred from uv , ir , radio , and x - ray .",
    "the comparisons yield contradictory results .",
    "their analysis favored a higher nebular color - excess for galaxies with larger intrinsic sfrs .    in separate studies , @xcite and @xcite used a large sample of uv - selected galaxies at @xmath7 and corrected both the h@xmath1 and uv sfrs with the color - excess derived from the best - fit sed models and applied the calzetti attenuation curve .",
    "they showed that using different color excesses for the continuum and lines generally resulted in h@xmath1-inferred sfrs that over - predicted those calculated from the dust - corrected uv emission and direct ir measurements .",
    "the apparently conflicting results mentioned above may be reconciled if the relation between the nebular and stellar color - excesses depends on the physical properties of galaxies , such as their sfrs @xcite or specific sfrs @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the ratio of the line optical depth to the continuum optical depth decreases with increasing ssfr and at ssfr@xmath30 the line - to - continuum optical depth ratio reaches the @xcite ratio assuming the @xcite attenuation curve .",
    "@xcite investigated the attenuation of the nebular regions at @xmath31 using the balmer decrement from stacked _ hst _ grism spectra assuming the calzetti curve , and found no strong trend of @xmath32 with sfr or ssfr .",
    "in @xcite study , at ssfr@xmath33 the ratio is consistent with 1 .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to understand the relationship between the uv and h@xmath1 emission in high - redshift star - forming galaxies , with a large sample that is immune to uncertainties in slit loss corrections that affects the h@xmath1 flux estimation ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the small sample sizes inherent in previous spectroscopic studies of h@xmath1 @xcite , and not subject to the bias of selecting high equivalent width objects from narrow - band selected samples @xcite .",
    "we consider in our analysis only spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies , enabling us to estimate the h@xmath1 flux from broad - band photometric excess techniques without the additional uncertainties that plague photometric redshifts @xcite .",
    "the impact of nebular lines on the broad - band photometry was known and studied for many years . using the photometric excesses to determine the line strengths",
    "was pioneered by @xcite , where they showed that the excess in _",
    "3.6@xmath3 m relative to the sed model continuum is due to the redshifted h@xmath1 emission line for their sample of galaxies at @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite also investigated a sample of galaxies at the same redshift range of @xcite and inferred the h@xmath1 emission line strengths by comparing the observed flux in _",
    "3.6@xmath3 m band and the continuum flux as expected from the sed model .",
    "following that , @xcite verified the photometric excess technique by applying it to a small sample of 9 galaxies at @xmath35 ; for 8 galaxies the [ o iii ] line fluxes inferred by the same technique as @xcite were within a factor of 2.5 of the spectroscopically measured [ o iii ] fluxes .",
    "an additional advantage of our study is that we include ir data to independently assess the dust - obscured sfr .",
