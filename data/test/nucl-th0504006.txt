    "the difficulties one meets in building a theory for relativistic bound system with finite number of particles are well known . up to now , in spite of many efforts in this field ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review , but also @xcite to get an example of the present approach to the relativistic shell model ) , to reconcile relativity , translational invariance and shell model seems to be a very hard task . moreover , even the connection between exclusive and inclusive processes is non - trivial for two order of problems .    by one side in fact in a relativistic framework",
    "it is impossible to fully disentangle the nucleonic and nuclear dynamics @xcite ( in a few word the nucleon form factors do not factorize ) even in the simple scheme of the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) , because the separation between longitudinal and transverse motion is a frame - dependent concept and the fermi motion of the nuclei prevents a full separation of them in a nuclear context .",
    "moreover even the concept of coulomb sum rule as it is usually interpreted looses its meaning and can be regained only at the prize of introducing a suitable renormalization factor ( that , fortunately , turns out to be largely model independent)@xcite .    on the other side ,",
    "when going beyond pwia multiple counting of diagrams occurs @xcite , with the consequence that the integral of the differential cross sections for @xmath0 or @xmath1 reactions no longer coincide with the inclusive cross section ( this because of the existence of channels where , for instance , another nucleon is emitted but not revealed ) .",
    "thus with the usual many - body expansion it is very difficult to connect forward scattering amplitude with the total cross section .",
    "this suggested us to extend the idea of green s functions ( of any kind ) by allowing situations where the kinematics of the initial and final nucleus can be different .",
    "this will be suitable to directly study the elastic processes in a fully poincar invariant way , but natural extensions could also be obtained ( and we plan do pursue this line in the future ) by choosing different initial and final states .    for the moment we limit ourselves to the problem of two interacting particles , namely a nucleus @xmath2 a nucleon or ( if case ) an elementary particle ( nucleon ) @xmath2 a quark .",
    "this job enables us to account for recoil effects in high energy nuclear reactions and in quark physics ( excitations of nucleon , meson ) .",
    "we first begin in section [ sec:0 ] with a short review of what it happens in the non - relativistic frame , in order to provide a layout of the matter we would like to generalise , and also in order to make easier the understanding of the origin of some problem we are concerned with , i.e. , if they arise from the many - body theory or from the relativity .",
    "next , in section [ sec:1 ] we consider the one particle ( or hole ) problem in presence of a nucleus ( to be more specific we consider nuclei with @xmath3 nucleons @xmath2 one nucleon ) .",
    "we use a formalism similar to the one of the green s function formalism . due to nuclear",
    "recoil the equations for hole and particle become different unlike the infinite systems or models where recoil is neglected .    in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we introduce a model with particle ( hole)-nucleus interaction , conceptually similar to the shell model .",
    "the equation of motion in such approach looks like the equation for a particle embedded in a mean field , but the equation is relativistically covariant ( of course with suitable choice of the interaction ) .",
    "the crucial point here is that we need to introduce the `` shell '' ground state of the system .",
    "section [ sec:5x ] provides a possible perturbative scheme to go beyond the mean field level , and sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] presents a simple case where the `` relativistic shell model '' can be easily solved , thus coming in contact with the real world , not pursuing abstract and inapplicable theoretical formalisms .",
    "the purpose of this section is twofold : by one side to remind the reader the general scheme of some old models for the propagation of a particle ( or hole ) inside a nucleus , that pertain to the history of nuclear physics , but that ( partially ) could be scarcely useful today in practical calculations ; on the other side we wish to remind those topics that can provide a guideline for our generalisation to a relativistic finite nucleus and to `` non - diagonal '' green s functions ( this topic well be clarified in the next section ) .",
    "if we limit ourselves to the propagation of a particle ( or hole ) inside a nucleus the most natural framework to begin with is certainly the feschbach s approach to the optical potential@xcite .",
    "let us repeat once more its main topics ( or , better , the ones we need in the following ) .",
    "the general idea is that , if a hamiltonian is defined in a hilbert space @xmath4 , then we can project schrdinger equation into a subspace @xmath5 the price to be payed being an energy dependence in the effective potential .",
    "as everybody knows , if @xmath6 is a projection operator @xmath7 and @xmath8 then the schrdinger equation in the space @xmath9 reads @xmath10\\p| \\psi>=    e\\p| \\psi>\\ ] ] the conceptual points we want to remark are the following :    * the optical potential can be defined in this way and its most relevant structures can be derived , but eq . ( [ eq-1:1 ] ) can by no means be used to evaluate it . *",
    "( [ eq-1:1 ] ) is quite general : according to the definition of @xmath6 it can be adapted to a variety of problems : we shall consider in the following the particle and hole propagation in a nucleus but we shall also remind its application to @xmath0 reactions in impulse approximation . *",
    "( [ eq-1:1 ] ) specifically imposes causality at each time .",
    "we shall see that this `` microscopic '' causality is the first reason that inhibits a microscopical calculation of the optical potential . *",
    "the optical potential displays an imaginary part , but since ( [ eq-1:1 ] ) is derived from a true schrdinger equation in a bigger space , the eigenvalues are necessarily real .",
    "this applies of course to the discrete ones , i.e. , to stable nuclear states . in order to conserve a lehmann representation with real eigenvalues ,",
    "the usual way out is that of discretizing the whole system by means of a box normalisation .",
    "the next requirement is the definition of @xmath6 , i.e. , of the physical problem we will concerned with . in the archetypal case ,",
    "namely the elastic scattering of protons off nuclei @xmath6 reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ground state of a nucleons with a nucleons , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the non - relativistic destruction and creation operator of a nucleon in the point @xmath15 ( spin and isospin will be neglected throughout this paper ) and @xmath16 is fixed by the requirement @xmath17 , that implies symbolically @xmath18 where @xmath19    the space of the solutions of the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq-1:1 ] ) is of course isomorphic to @xmath20 .",
    "we can define an orthonormal basis in @xmath20 by defining @xmath21 we also assume that this basis is complete .",
    "the eigenvalue equation now reads @xmath22 and we are in position to connect the solutions of ( [ eq-1:6 ] ) with the true eigenstates of the @xmath23 system : let @xmath24 a solution of the complete schrdinger equation in the space of @xmath23 particles .",
    "some simple algebra enable us to write the solutions of ( [ eq-1:6 ] ) in the form @xmath25 the eigenvalue being of course @xmath26 . for future reference let us define the function",
    "@xmath27 we have shown above that up to a rescaling @xmath28 is solution of the eigenvalue equation for the `` optical '' hamiltonian .",
    "it also follows that @xmath28 is , by itself , eigenstate of the ( unsymmetric ) operator @xmath29    very much in the same way we can handle other situations . in particular we shall be concerned with hole propagation inside a nucleus .",
    "thus we define another projection operator , namely @xmath30 and all the above formalism follows up provided we do the substitutions @xmath31 and @xmath32    the next step , in the early times of the optical potential , was the connection with the single particle green s function of the system , defined , as usual , as @xmath33 it was shown by bell and squires@xcite that the self - energy ( or mass operator ) can be interpreted as an optical potential ( not coincident however with the one introduced by feshbach and discussed above ) . as is well known @xmath34 can be separated into a retarded and an advanced part having the following lehmann representation : @xmath35 where the functions @xmath28 and @xmath36 are those discussed above .",
    "note that the functions @xmath28 and @xmath36 are in some way connected with the shell model : in fact the index @xmath37 runs over all the possible nuclear eigenstates , but grouping together some levels and constructing in this way the single - particle levels and discarding those with a too small strength one is lead back to the shell model .",
    "this however implies the breaking of the translational invariance , since the latter would strictly imply the functional dependence @xmath38 how to recover the translational invariance and at the same time to leave sufficient room t2o introduce the analogous of the `` shell - model wave functions '' will be the task pursued in the following .",
    "the previous discussion enables us to write down ( but by no means to solve or to approximate ) the inverse of @xmath39 .",
    "we can write indeed @xmath40^{-1}({\\bf r},{\\bf r}^\\prime;\\omega)=\\omega - t -{\\cal m}^\\pm({\\bf r},{\\bf r}^\\prime;\\omega)\\ ] ] where @xmath41 could be called the mass operator for particles or holes , with the property @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "the discussion above shows that ultimately @xmath44 provided the particle or hole projection operator is used in the rhs . in this way we have indirectly defined the mass operators @xmath41 ; it must be reminded however that the whole green s function obeys the dyson s equation @xmath45 where the mass operator ( or self - energy ) can be derived from a perturbative expansion , but it is _ not _ the sum of the two mass operators defined separately for particles and holes , and they can in no way be derived from any perturbative scheme .    before ending this section",
    "we would also remind that the same formalism have been employed in studying @xmath0 reactions in the frame of the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) .",
    "there it is convenient to define many projection operators , any of them pertaining to a residual nucleus left in an excited state plus an outgoing nucleon .",
    "this again is formally correct but by no means one can be able to explicitly write down the ( almost ) infinite set of different optical potentials .",
    "thus one ultimately ends up with assuming the same optical potential for the outgoing nucleon independently of the state the residual nucleus is left in . as a non - trivial consequence",
    "the differences between longitudinal and transverse channels are lost ( see @xcite to recover it ) .",
    "again here the most natural treatment of the problem goes through the introduction of a particle - hole green s function having the form ( we follow the standard notations ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the electro - magnetic current .",
    "the differences ( we could better say the incompatibility ) between this approach and the dwia has already been shown by the authors of this paper in ref .",
    "in a relativistic approach , with the aim of pursuing the analogy with the description of the non - relativistic single - particle or single - hole motion discussed above , and moreover in order to avoid the disease of multiple counting of diagrams as outlined in @xcite , we consider a bound system of fermionic and bosonic fields with finite baryonic number and in the ground state in its frame of reference but assuming in general non - zero different total momenta for incoming and outgoing states .",
    "this approach will be applied here to nuclear physics , but the study of the quarks dynamics in a nucleon could also be an affordable task . moreover in both cases the accounting of the recoil effects is allowed .",
    "let us first of all introduce the incoming and outgoing nuclear bound state @xmath48 and @xmath49 for a nucleus of mass @xmath50 and initial and final 3-momenta @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we can of course introduce initial and final 4-momenta by putting @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the normalisation reads @xmath55    we now define a generalised single particle green s function as @xmath56 we have already observed in the previous section that in a 2-points green s function the translational invariance will rigidly constrain the analytical form of the functions @xmath36 and @xmath28 thus forbidding its interpretation ( within some approximation schemes ) as single - particle wave functions .",
    "the above choice of writing a generalised single particle green s function , with , actually , one more argument , relaxes the above constraint and will turn out to be the key issue in constructing the relativistic generalisation of the shell model without violating the poincar invariance",
    ".    the particular case we are considering deserves a comment about the realization of the linked cluster theorem . to understand it",
    "we could interpret @xmath57 as a limiting case of a two - particle green s function .",
    "imagine that @xmath58 is the destruction operator of the nucleus in its ground state with total momentum @xmath51 and @xmath59 the physical vacuum",
    ". then @xmath57 can be regarded ( up to normalising factors ) as the following limit : @xmath60 and the denominator @xmath61 is the tool that ensures the cancellation of the disconnected diagrams in the two ( composite ) particle green s function .",
    "of course this property is preserved through the limiting process and consequently @xmath57 ( where we neglect the denominator @xmath61 throughout this paper ) has always to be intended as constructed by linked diagrams only .",
    "now we want to represent the function @xmath57 in lehmann representation .",
    "first however we need some kinematical considerations .    if @xmath62 is the 4-momentum operator , i.e. , @xmath63 , @xmath64 then we know that @xmath65 ( with @xmath66 ) . with these definitions",
    "we can write the fourier transform of @xmath57 .",
    "here however an ambiguity arises , since our @xmath34 is ultimately , as quoted above , a two - particle green s function , we can choose in fourier transform two different kinematics , one tailored for the propagation of a particle and one for a hole .",
    "for the `` hole '' channel , whose kinematics is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ]    we define @xmath67 let us remark that all the formalism here is covariant , and in order remind this property we indicate in @xmath68 a dependence upon the 4-vectors @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "strictly speaking the mass shell condition on @xmath69 and @xmath70 would entail a dependence upon the 3-vector part only .",
    "the lehmann representation of @xmath72 is easily written down as @xmath73 where @xmath74 that reflects the kinematics of fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] .",
    "there the intermediate lines denote the sum over all the eigenstates of the system with baryonic number @xmath75 ( first term ) or @xmath23 ( second term in the rhs of fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] ) having total 4-momentum @xmath71 .",
    "the former states are characterised by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is an index running over all the @xmath75 states , their mass being @xmath78 , with the relations @xmath79 the normalisation being @xmath80 the states with @xmath23 particles are denoted with the index @xmath81 and is understood to run over all the @xmath23 excited states .",
    "for them eqs . to also hold up to the replacement @xmath82 .    here , in order to be completely covariant we have allowed the intermediate states to contain negative energy solutions too",
    ". this case will be practically irrelevant in nuclear physics , but not at all negligible if we want to extend this formalism to qcd .",
    "note also that , just to make a choice , we have assumed for a state with baryon number @xmath3 a boson normalisation ( @xmath3 is assumed to be even ) .",
    "thus consequently an @xmath75 state must be normalised as a fermion .    in order to make the lehmann representation for @xmath72 more explicit we introduce in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) the complete set @xmath83 ( for the @xmath75 system ) in the first term of its rhs and @xmath84 in the second one .",
    "we easily find@xcite @xmath85 where the @xmath86 and @xmath13 are defined as @xmath87 the equal time commutation relations imply @xmath88 inserting now a complete set of intermediate states @xmath89 in the two terms of the anti - commutator in the lhs and using we get the a completeness equation in the form @xmath90    we observe that now the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 play the same role of @xmath36 and @xmath28 in the eqs . and of sec .",
    "[ sec:0 ] , but now the formalism is poincar invariant and further , even if we are only considering the nucleonic green s function , all the information about the dynamics of the system is already embedded in @xmath91 and @xmath92 .    in the same line as above , we can also introduce a `` particle '' kinematics : in analogy with @xmath72 we introduce @xmath93 whose graphical representation is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] .    by comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eq0.5.1 ] ) one immediately establishes the link @xmath94    for sake of simplicity we consider a specific model of a fermionic field interacting with scalar bosonic field @xmath95 , neglecting the self - interactions @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in this simplified scheme (",

    "namely @xmath102    we can first of all prove that , on general grounds , that @xmath103 can be inverted and consequently a mass operator can be defined by means of a perturbation expansion . the standard proof requires to introduce the generating functional for connected diagrams and then to perform a lgendre transformation on it , and since it can be found in the usual textbooks @xcite , is not reported here .",
    "we only remark that the generalisation of the green s function definition used in the present paper will only affect the boundary conditions of the path integral representation of the generating functional , but not the steps needed to define the mass operator .",

    "the mass operator is univoquely determined by the green s function and embodies both particle and hole propagation .",

    ". also shows that a pole of @xmath105 corresponds to a 0 of @xmath72 and vice versa .",
    "the `` particle '' mass operator has an analogous expansion but its poles lie in the region @xmath116 .",
    "the knowledge of the green s function ( or of the mass operator ) gives us access to many observables , like , for instance , the number of baryons @xmath117 and the ground state energy @xmath118      \\gh(p , p;q)\\\\      & + \\intt{p'}\\mh(p , p';q)\\gh(p',p;q)\\bigr\\}+\\frac{<p|h_0^\\sigma|p>}{<p|p>}~.    \\end{split}\\ ] ]    now we can introduce the analogous of the `` single particle wave functions '' in our relativistic approach , generalising what was described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq-1:7],[eq-1:8 ] ) .",
    "this is done by taking eq .",
    "( [ eq1.6.1 ] ) and integrating it over @xmath113 in a small circle containing a pole @xmath119 ( within box normalisation if needed ) and remembering that the poles of the green s function and of the mass operator never coincide . in so doing we immediately find @xmath120    the above quantities @xmath86 are _ not _ , of course , wave functions , because they feel the presence in the system of antiparticles as well as of mesons , but can be looked at as eigenfunction of the system .",
    "the case of uniformly invariant system ( free fermi gas or maybe quark - gluon plasma ) may enable us to make strongly simplifying assumptions . for finite systems we however can still exploit the idea of a mean field calculation .",
    "the last equations of the previous section contain the ground idea to build the relativistic analogue of the shell model .",
    "we first consider the `` hole '' channel and rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) in the form @xcite @xmath121 with the subtle difference that now @xmath113 is considered a free parameter .",
    "if follows that ( [ eq37:1 ] ) considered at a given @xmath113 can be regarded as an eigenvalue equation , the eigenvalue being @xmath122 that is in general different from the @xmath113 fixed and contained in @xmath105 . here",
    "notations matter : in fact @xmath123 depends upon the 4-vector @xmath71 , chosen by the exterior .",
    "we have left the dependence upon @xmath69 instead of @xmath51 to remind the reader that @xmath123 is a 4-spinor depending , furthermore , upon lorentz - covariant quantities like @xmath124 and @xmath125 , being understood however that @xmath126 is fixed by the mass shell condition .",
    "having distinguished between @xmath113 and the eigenvalue @xmath122 , ( [ eq37:1 ] ) will have a complete orthogonal set of eigenfunction , i.e. , the @xmath123 must obey the properties @xmath127 @xmath128 being a suitable normalisation factor .",
    "( [ eq37:1 ] ) at a fixed and suitably chosen @xmath113 looks like a shell model equation having a ( non - local ) `` shell model potential '' @xmath105 ; the functions @xmath129 are not connected with any observable quantities , but they are expected , for a reasonable approximation of @xmath105 and in a convenient range of @xmath113 ( it means some average of the single particle levels of a shell model well ) to approach the `` single hole '' wave functions @xmath130 previously introduced .",
    "this is of course likely below the fermi level .    for the particle channel we rewrite eq .",
    "as @xmath131 normalisation and completeness relations being fully analogous the `` hole wave function '' case .",
    "according to the general form we can now introduce the shell - model - like green s function as @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are suitable normalisation factors and @xmath135 with @xmath136 of course the labels @xmath137 s are ordered increasingly with the corresponding energy and @xmath138 denotes the highest occupied level ( fermi level ) .",
    "the equation the function @xmath139 fulfils is similar to ( [ eq1.6.1 ] ) , provided the @xmath140 function in the r.h.s .",
    "is replaced by @xmath141 the above is of course expected to approximate a @xmath140 as far as the `` shell model '' approximation holds valid .    in the above formalism clearly the poles of @xmath142",
    "must also be poles of @xmath143 ( the converse is not true in general because some poles of @xmath72 are killed by the projection operator @xmath144 ) .",
    "we assume that the equations @xmath145 have one or more ( maybe infinite ) roots for a given `` single particle '' quantum number @xmath137 .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq1:80 ] ) we obtain @xmath148    thus the above suggests to attribute to the @xmath149 the meaning of a generalisation at the relativist level of a single particle wave function in a shell model , fully maintaining , nevertheless , lorentz and poincar invariance .",
    "we repeat once more that this occurs because we are considering a `` non - diagonal '' single - particle green s function where the recoil of the daughter nucleus is accounted for .",
    "now we make a physical assumption that further narrows us to the shell model : we assume that a one particle level @xmath137 is composed by the same sub - levels @xmath150 of the exact many - body problem in such a way that @xmath151 this property is not peculiar of a relativistic system , since the same will happen in the non - relativistic case .",
    "now we are ready to make the last step and introduce a phenomenological `` shell model '' potential @xmath152 , with @xmath69 and @xmath108 restricted to the nucleus mass shell and the 4-vector @xmath153 chosen as @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the mass of the daughter nucleus in its ground state ( this choice maintains the analogy with the non - relativistic case : see , e.g. , @xcite )    thus the potential @xmath156 is independent from @xmath113 and we assume it to be symmetric , i.e. , @xmath157 . from now on we must guess @xmath158 on phenomenological grounds in such a way that @xmath159      \\varphi_\\ell(p^\\prime , q )    \\end{split}\\ ] ] will be reasonably small .",
    "once a parameterisation for @xmath156 has been given we can write down the eigenvalue equation for the``hole wave functions '' @xmath160 being @xmath161 the index @xmath137 ( of course discrete ) summarises now all the quantum numbers pertaining to a given `` one - hole '' state in the `` shell model potential '' @xmath156 .    as an aside , in analogy with the `` hole '' channel",
    ", we can introduce an equation for the `` particle '' channel as @xmath162    up to now covariance has been preserved . the next step is to find a practical way to solve the `` shell model equation '' . since it is not so easy to give an explicit solution of it in a covariant form , we are forced , in the following , to choose a suitable reference frame where the equation is particularly simple . once the solution has been found , however , we need a procedure to boost it to any reference frame . this will be our next task .",
    "thus , coming to the `` hole '' channel , there are two natural choice for the reference frame .",
    "one is to assume it as the rest frame for the @xmath75 system , i.e. , @xmath163 : the eigenvalue equation there becomes @xmath164 where @xmath165 another customary choice is to assume @xmath166 ( rest frame for the @xmath3-nucleons system ) .",
    "of course any reference frame can be reached by means of a boost .",
    "thus let @xmath59 be the @xmath166 frame and let @xmath167 be the boost from @xmath59 to the state @xmath168 corresponding to @xmath163 : @xmath169 let us specify in more details the state of the daughter nucleus : we expand the previous index @xmath137 as @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the total angular momentum , @xmath50 its third component and @xmath172 the parity .",
    "@xmath77 will then resume all the other intrinsic ( not frame - dependent ) quantum numbers .",
    "we can now write @xmath173 where as usual @xmath174 is defined through the relation @xmath175 and reads @xmath176 of course @xmath177 denotes the velocity of the boost from the rest frame of the daughter nucleus and an extra factor accounting for the mass difference between the @xmath3 and @xmath75 systems is required , namely @xmath178 the above entails @xmath179 in the @xmath166 frame the 4-vector @xmath71 transforms into @xmath180 and the `` eigenfunction '' @xmath86 reads @xmath181 with @xmath182 this definitions implies @xmath183    the formalism above has shown that we can solve the `` shell model '' equation in the rest frame for the @xmath75 daughter nucleus and then , using the above kinematics , transfer the solutions to the usual rest frame of the @xmath3 nucleus , namely @xmath166 . having established good transformation properties of the solutions , we now need to find them in the preferred reference system .",
    "before doing explicit ( model ) calculations let us investigate a little what lies beyond the shell model .",
    "the shell model in nuclear physics is usually thought as the 0@xmath184 order ( mean field ) of a perturbation expansion .",
    "using the eigenfunctions derived from eqs .",
    "and we can represent the `` unperturbed '' green s function in the `` hole '' kinematic , in analogy with , as @xmath185    also , we can introduce a `` shell - model particle green s function '' by applying the relation to eq . , namely @xmath186    the first order in the expansion of the mass operator @xmath187 in terms of the meson interaction coincides the hartree - fock approximation : the first contribution reads @xmath188 where of course @xmath189 is the free @xmath100 propagator , and is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:44 ] ,    while the second term represents , as one can easily convince himself , the fock contribution , namely @xmath190 and is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig:45 ] ,    the other terms have complicated and in practice non manageable expressions that involve the detailed structure ( i.e. , the excited states ) of the target nucleus .",
    "we only show diagrammatically a second order contribution in fig .",
    "[ fig:46 ] .",

    "the approach presented in this paper is beyond the usual relativistic shell calculations , since the usual ways to afford relativity ( see our ref . @xcite and the many references quoted therein ) mainly concern qhd ( quantum - hadro - dynamics ) inspired models with a space - dependent mass term that explicitly breaks poincar invariance .",
    "this flaw is obviously not obnoxious when heavy nuclei are concerned , it has no future however when handling a nucleon as a 3-quark system .",
    "in the present paper we have shown how a relativistic theory of the nucleus can be constructed still preserving the main features of the shell model . in our approach in fact a shell model like equation has been constructed , admittedly in a well defined reference frame , but we have also built up all the formalism needed to boost the results to any other frame of reference , thus reconstructing lorentz and poincar invariance : this is a by far non - trivial achievement , since in the traditional nuclear physics translational invariance is broken from the very beginning by the shell model even in a non - relativistic scheme .",
    "of course the above is particularly suitable for small systems , since recoil and center - of - mass motion is fully accounted for .",
    "this goes clearly beyond the approaches based on translationally invariant systems@xcite .",
    "of course some approximations can be needed in practical calculations , and mainly we introduce a `` shell - model potential '' which is thought to approximate the mass operator . again , exactly as described in sec .",
    "[ sec:0 ] we can use the same potential to describe particle and hole dynamics , but still the same disease survives , since in principle the mass operator in the `` hole '' and `` particle '' kinematics are intrinsically different . thus we can use the same potential as a starting point , but then different perturbative expansions are required , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec:5x ] .",
    "the key issue of the paper is the definition of the `` shell model wave function '' : we systematically use quotation marks in referring this quantity because it is not at all a wave function , but is defined , instead , as the expectation value between physical states ( containing any kind of particles , namely nucleons , mesons and antinucleons ) of some field operators .",
    "thus these quantities , referred to in the above as @xmath86 and @xmath231 , maintain the formal analogy with the the true nuclear wave functions of the non - relativistic shell model , but contain a much more involved dynamics , since as many mesons and antinucleons as possible are allowed to appear , and hence accounted for , inside @xmath86 and @xmath231 , the only constraint being a variation of the baryonic number of @xmath232 .",
    "thus we can apply the formalism developed so far to any relativistic system , not necessarily to nuclei , but also ( as obvious ) to nucleons , where the `` shell model wave function '' ( still with quotation marks ! ) can be regarded as the analogous of the quark wave functions in the constituent quark model , not disregarding , however , the parton content of the constituent quark , which is a composite object built up on current quarks , antiquaks and gluons .    our formalism can also be regarded as a theoretical ground for the constituent quark model and at the same time shows its limitations : in fact , as shown above , we can derive from the @xmath86 and @xmath231 the static properties of the nucleus or of the nucleon , but the response functions ( in the nuclear case ) or the @xmath233 or lepton interaction with a nucleon require a more detailed study , since the degrees of freedom embodied in the `` shell model wave function '' require to be explicitly dealt with .",
    "we plan in a successive work to explore the dynamical properties of a relativistic complex but finite system ."
