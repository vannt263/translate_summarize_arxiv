    "for the present model , the inherent time scale is given by @xmath153 while the external time scale is @xmath0 .",
    "adiabaticity breaks down when @xmath154 .",
    "this leads to a characteristic momentum scale which is related to the quench rate @xmath0 through the following relation : ^z~. [ scale ] the total number of quasiparticle excitation to higher state is proportional to the phase space volume @xmath155 .",
    "this scaling law holds true for @xmath156 . in the present model ,",
    "therefore the measure of the defect density given by @xmath157 integrated over all momenta mode scales as @xmath145 ; this scaling is reflected in the asymptotic behaviour of the le .",
    "one can observe that @xmath158 with the proper adiabatic and sudden limits of @xmath0 i.e. , @xmath146 for perfect adiabatic quenching and @xmath38 for perfect sudden quenching .",
    "but when lm is being quenched through a finite driving rate @xmath145 , the infinite time expressions of le , for a fast and a slow quenching scheme , is modified in a relevant way . the ground state conjecture does not hold true for a finite @xmath0 .",
    "the le in the slow quenching case could not be described as an modulo square overlap between initial and final ground state of lm .",
    "the finite @xmath0 brings additional contributions coming from higher excited state to the infinite time le . in the infinite time limit",
    "le under a fast quenching scheme is also modified from the @xmath38 limit of le .",
    "in this manuscript , we have studied the dynamics of a luttinger model following an interaction quench when the quench is applied over a finite duration @xmath0 . the loschmidt echo for a finite time linear interaction quench",
    "is studied in both large @xmath0 and small @xmath0 limits . in particular , we reproduce the results for the adiabatic and sudden quench limits derived earlier @xcite , and using perturbative solutions we estimate the corrections to both these limiting situations in the early time limit as well as the infinite time limit .",
    "we also compare the perturbative results with the exact numerical ones , and obtain a reasonably good agreement between them .",
    "let us summarize the interesting findings of our study : we find that the correction terms scales as @xmath145 in the large @xmath0 limit and as @xmath139 in the @xmath1 limit which show up both in the early time and the large time behaviour .",
    "we propose generic scaling relations to justify the scaling of the correction terms . finally , our results confirm that for a finite @xmath0 the excited states contribute non - trivially to the echo even in the asymptotic limit ( @xmath11 ) .    note that our results [ see for _ e.g. _ , eqs .",
    "- ] depend on the non - universal short distance cutoff , @xmath62 .",
    "this may be a consequence of the fact that we are using a linear ramp , whose derivative has discontinuities at @xmath48 and @xmath110 .",
    "a fourier transform of such a non - analytic ramp has a fat high frequency tail , which is governed by a power law @xcite .",
    "the high frequencies in the tail give rise to excitations that are beyond the low - energy description of the luttinger model .",
    "we believe that if the linear ramp were replaced by a smooth quench protocol [ _ e.g. _ , @xmath159-like ] , then the tail would be exponential and the inverse ultraviolet cutoff @xmath62 would not appear in the results .",
    "finally we note that the luttinger model uses a linearized dispersion relation which is valid only in a small window of energy around the fermi points . in any realistic quenching scenario ,",
    "the system will be excited to energies where , the non - linearities of the dispersion relation begin to play a role in the dynamics via the so called ` umklapp ' scattering of the right- and left - moving modes .",
    "it is commonly argued in the literature that all these deviations are irrelevant in the renormalization group sense , which means that their effects are limited , or that their effects die out if we wait for long enough times . another way to avoid exciting the system to very high energies ( where the luttinger model is not valid ) , is to tune the interaction parameter ( @xmath160 ) in a regime which is much smaller than the fermi energy of the system @xcite .",
    "however , it is not completely clear , if the luttinger model is appropriate to describe the quench dynamics in a realistic physical system , even though we believe that the long - term dynamics of the system should be dominated by the low - energy excitations .",
