    "other studies of various quantities - which pertain to the morphology and complexity of the nodal network - were published in the mathematical and physical literature , building upon the older results regarding the bounds on the total lengths of the nodal lines and their curvature @xcite .",
    "e.g. , in @xcite the distribution of the curvature is calculated , in addition to the mean and the variance of the total length of the nodal set .",
    "the distribution of the avoidance distances between nodal lines was also computed @xcite , to mention few examples .",
    "+ an important breakthrough has been achieved by bogomolny and schmit @xcite who implemented a critical percolation model that explains the large scale structure of nodal domains in chaotic wave functions .",
    "this model is supported by a variety of numerical calculations .",
    "for example : the expectation value and variance of the nodal count for chaotic billiards , as well as the distribution of areas of nodal domains , follow the predictions of the model @xcite ; the nodal lines in the high energy limit seem ( on large scales ) to be sle@xmath14 curves @xcite as it is proved for the boundaries of percolation clusters @xcite . despite the good agreement ,",
    "the percolation description is a priori insensitive to the structure of the nodal set in scales of the order of a wavelength .",
    "in addition , it was demonstrated by foltin _",
    "et al _ @xcite that there are some special measures with a scaling behavior which is different for percolation and the nodal set of the random - wave ensemble .",
    "the latter special measures , in general , probe subwavelength scales at two points at a ( large ) distance .    in this work",
    "we suggest a new ( quantum mechanical ) method for the classification of billiards according to their classical properties",
    ". we will discuss below in what sense the signatures in nodal patterns differ from the scenario known for the more common spectral and wavefunction analysis . +",
    "our method provides yet another test to the conjectures by berry and bogomolny .",
    "the parameter which we use in order to interrogate the morphology of nodal lines is defined as follows - we consider the @xmath10th eigenfunction of ( [ eq : helmholtz ] ) , and its nodal domains sequence @xmath15 .",
    "the indices @xmath16 specify a nodal domain ; for this domain we define the area - to - perimeter ratio @xmath17 by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the area and perimeter of @xmath21 and the ratio is measured in units of the wavelength @xmath1 .",
    "we shall define for different ensembles two different probability measures on the parameter @xmath0 . + for wave functions which satisfy ( [ eq : helmholtz ] ) on a compact domain @xmath4 , we consider a spectral interval @xmath22 , \\",
    "g>0 $ ] with @xmath23 , and define : @xmath24 note that in the above , the weights of nodal domains which belong to the same eigenfunction are equal , but not necessarily the same as the weight of domains which belong to another eigenfunction .",
    "+ the second probability measure pertains to an ensemble of wave functions on unbounded domains , in our case - the gaussian random - wave ensemble ( which will be described in section [ sec : random and chaotic ] ) .",
    "since the wave functions do not satisfy any boundary condition , we consider them over an arbitrarily large and fixed domain @xmath25 , and include only the nodal domains which are strictly inside @xmath26 .",
    "we denote their number for a given member of the ensemble by @xmath27 , and define : @xmath28 the reason for using two different measures is the different nature of the problems at hand .",
    "however in the limit the two measures coalesce .",
    "we shall investigate the existence and the features of a high energy limiting distribution @xmath29 the choice of the area - to - perimeter ratio @xmath0 as a parameter to characterize the geometry of nodal domains is is inspired by the following considerations : the nodal pattern for separable surfaces is a checker - board , where a nodal domain @xmath30 is asymptotically a rectangle with sides of the order of a wavelength .",
    "therefore @xmath31 and @xmath32 will be of the order of one .",
    "similarly , according to the percolation model , a nodal domain of a chaotic surface is asymptotically shaped as a chain @xcite with @xmath33 cells , where for each cell @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the cell s contribution to the nodal domain s perimeter ( see [ eq : a_to_l_perco ] ) .",
    "we get that in both cases the parameter @xmath0 for a typical nodal domain will be of the order of unity , yielding localized distributions for the two types of surfaces .",
    "however , as will be shown below , the distributions differ substantially for systems with different classical properties . + in addition , the area - to - perimeter ratio @xmath0 is relevant not only to the study of the high energy limit , but arises as a natural parameter in the study of isoperimetric inequalities ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "the restriction of a wave function @xmath6 to one of its nodal domains @xmath36 , is an eigenfunction of the laplace - beltrami operator on the domain @xmath36 , with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "since it consists of a single nodal domain , courant theorem @xcite implies that it is the ground - state of @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , knowing @xmath17 we can express the ground - state energy in terms of the area and perimeter of @xmath36 .",
    "in the mathematical literature there are known bounds for such expressions - a relevant example is the bound for convex domains , derived by makai @xcite ( lower bound ) and plya @xcite ( upper bound , which was generalised to all simply or doubly connected domains by osserman @xcite ) : @xmath37 in order to derive a distribution function @xmath2 between the extreme values , some measure on domains should be defined . here",
    "we confine ourselves to well defined families of domains - those obtained as nodal domains of a given ensemble , and due to this restriction we are able to define the measures ( [ eq : gendis1]),([eq : gendis2 ] ) and study the limiting distribution for different classes of systems .",
    "+ in this paper we shall examine the distribution function @xmath2 for separable and chaotic domains and for the gaussian random - wave ensemble . we will show that    * the limit distributions we obtain have strong  universal  features .",
    "that is , they depend crucially on the type of classical dynamics the manifold supports , and only to a lesser extent on the idiosyncratic details of the actual system . *",
    "the limiting distribution for the random - wave ensemble is similar to the one for chaotic domains , as predicted by berry s conjecture . *",
    "the limiting distribution for random - waves ( chaotic billiards ) is consistent with the percolation model but contains ( universal ) information beyond percolation as short length scales on the order of a wavelength are probed for small nodal domains .",
    "the limitation to ( quantum mechanically ) separable systems is due to the checkerboard structure in the nodal patterns of their wavefunctions .",
    "a generalization to all integrable or pseudo - integrable domains , where , in general , the checkerboard structure is lost , would be desirable .",
    "this highlights a general difference in the scenario known e.g.  from spectral statistics where all integrable systems ( separable or not ) share the same ( poissonian ) statistics .",
    "quite contrary statistical properties of nodal domains in integrable systems are very different for seperable systems with a checkerboard structure and non - separable systems with generically no nodal crossings @xcite .",
    "note , that when a separable system is slightly perturbed , all nodal crossings will open ( in an often highly correlated way which makes the introduction of a percolation model at this point quite difficult ) and statistical properties will change singularly ( again in contrast to what is known from spectral statistics where a small perturbation smoothly changes the statistics ) .",
    "as was mentioned above , the nodal network of eigenfunctions of separable surfaces has a checkerboard structure .",
    "this follows from the fact that one can always choose a basis in which all the eigenfunctions can be brought into a product form .",
    "therefore , one might expect that the main features of the limiting distributions of different surfaces will be similar .",
    "we will show that this is the case , and therefore we begin this section by explicit calculation of @xmath38 for a rectangular billiard .",
    "the discussion of this simple example will pave the way to computing @xmath2 for other systems ( the disc billiard and a family of surfaces of revolution ) and to the identification of some common features which we assume to be universal for all the separable systems .",
    "the detailed computations are presented in [ app : a ] .",

    "the nodal domains are rectangles of size : @xmath43 , therefore : @xmath44 and @xmath45 where : @xmath46 .",
    "the mere form of ( [ eq : rhorec ] ) implies that @xmath0 is bounded by : @xmath47 thus , the support of the distribution function @xmath2 is an interval which is narrower than ( [ eq : mpbound ] ) .",

    "it is supported by the compact interval @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "@xmath38 is an analytic and monotonic decreasing function in the interval where it is supported .",
    "4 .   @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 , hence , @xmath38 is discontinuous at both boundaries of the support .",
    "the fact that @xmath57 depends solely on the partition of the energy between the modes was a key element in the construction above , and plays a similar role in computing @xmath2 for the other separable systems . when @xmath58 , we get from equation ( [ eq : rhorec ] ) that @xmath59 , while @xmath60 means that the energy is concentrated completely in one degree of freedom .",
    "the concentration of probability near @xmath58 shows that equal partition of energy is prevalent among the nodal domains",
    ".    an explicit derivation of the limiting distribution @xmath2 for the family of simple surfaces of revolution ( following bleher @xcite ) can be found in [ app : a ] , in addition to a separate derivation for the disc billiard . in both cases",
    "it is proven that : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is given by ( [ eq : prec ] ) , and @xmath63 is a finite , positive and smooth function of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the features which characterize @xmath38 dominate @xmath64 for all the systems considered ; thus @xmath64 is supported on the same interval and demonstrates the same type of discontinuities at its boundaries .",
    "+ following the striking similarity of the distributions for all of the investigated manifolds , we suggest that properties ( i)-(v ) of @xmath38 which were derived for the rectangular billiard , are universal features of @xmath64 for all two - dimensional separable surfaces .",
    "we support this assumption by a heuristic model which is presented in [ app : a ] .    , @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67,width=384 ]    numerical simulations for the rectangle and the disc billiards for several energy intervals show good agreement with the analytic derivation ( see figures [ fig : prec],[fig : pdisc ] ) . for",
    "numerically obtained results at finite energies , two kinds of deviations from the limiting distributions can be observed :    1 .",
    "fluctuations along the entire range of @xmath0 ( for the disc ) or discrete jumps ( for the rectangle ) in the value of @xmath2 , which vanish in the limiting distribution due to the convergence of the corrections to the semi - classical approximations ( i.e. turning sums over quantum numbers into integrals and the neglect of terms of order @xmath68 ) .",
    "cusps near @xmath69 and @xmath70 for the disc : the origin for the appearance of these features is due to nodal domains with exceptional geometry - the inner domains of all wavefunctions ( which are asymptotically triangles ) for the former , the domains of @xmath71 ( which are ring shaped ) for the latter .",
    "it is verified ( analytically and numerically ) that these differences converge to zero as @xmath72 , or faster .",
    "while for chaotic wavefunctions there is no known analytic expression for the nodal lines , we will use known results about the morphology of the nodal set in order to propose some physical arguments for the expected distribution .",
    "the explanations we propose are all in agreement with numerical simulations - a detailed information about the numerical techniques and the reliability of the results can be found in appendix b. + a frequently used model for eigenfunctions in a chaotic billiard is that of the gaussian random - wave ensemble .",
    "this is based on a conjecture by berry @xcite that eigenfunctions of a chaotic billiard in the limit of high energies have the same statistical properties as the gaussian random - wave ensemble .",
    "+ a solution @xmath73 for the helmholtz equation ( [ eq : helmholtz ] ) with a given energy @xmath74 on a given domain , can be written as a superposition of functions @xmath75 which span a complete basis , for example : @xmath76 since the solutions of ( [ eq : helmholtz ] ) are real , we are restricted ( for this choice of basis ) by @xmath77 . according to berry s conjecture , expanding the eigenfunctions of chaotic billiards ( in the high energy limit ) in terms of ( [ eq : randomwave ] ) , the coefficients @xmath78 distribute for @xmath79 as independent gaussian random variables with @xmath80 and therefore can be modeled statistically by this ensemble of independently distributed gaussian random - waves .",
    "+        as suggested by bogomolny and schmit @xcite , the nodal domains of a random wave are shaped as critical percolation clusters ( see figure [ fig : bond_percolation ] ) , where each site is of an average area @xmath81 where , as before , @xmath82 .",

    "the average area - to - perimeter ratio can be written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "this relation can be used as a guideline to the desired distribution of @xmath0 .",
    "+ indeed , as was confirmed numerically , the distribution @xmath2 for nodal domains follows ( [ eq : a_to_l_perco ] ) in several aspects .",
