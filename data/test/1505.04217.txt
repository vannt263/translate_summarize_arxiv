    "correlated quantum many - body systems exhibit a wide range of unconventional phenomena .",
    "their rich physics emerges from the intricate entanglement structure of those systems , which however at the same time renders their theoretical study a challenging task .",
    "some of the most important insights into the physics of those systems have thus been obtained through wavefunction ansatzes , such as the bcs or the laughlin state . in recent years , ideas from quantum information have led to classes of ansatz wavefunctions constructed to capture the entanglement structure present in interacting quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , projected entangled pair states ( peps )  @xcite describe correlated many - body systems by associating a local tensor to each site which builds up the entanglement in the wavefunction through auxiliary indices .",

    "the key problem is to understand how the local properties of the tensor ( and thus the hamiltonian ) determine the global properties , i.e. , quantum order , of the wavefunction .    in the last years",
    ", considerable progress has been made in the study of topological order  @xcite in peps models : it has been understood how topological order is related to the structure of the local tensor , and how this allows to construct _ all _ topological ground states from a _ single _ tensor  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the mechanism behind topological phase transitions within this framework has been clarified  @xcite , and it has been found that it can be related to symmetry breaking in the so - called transfer operator  @xcite . finally , peps models have also been shown to provide a natural framework to study the entanglement properties of correlated quantum systems through entanglement hamiltonians  @xcite associated to the boundary of the system  @xcite .     *",

    "the aim of this paper is to initiate the development of an analogous framework for studying conventional long - range order and spontaneous symmetry breaking within peps models , thereby complementing the understanding of topological phases .",

    "ii ) _ how the different symmetry broken states can be described in terms of the single peps tensor .",
    "we first show that long - range order originates in a degeneracy of the transfer operator , and how the latter in turn leads to spontaneous breaking of the symmetry under fluctuations .",
    "we subsequently characterize the symmetry broken states in terms of the peps tensor , and show that they correspond to the extreme points of the degenerate fixed point space of the transfer operator .",
    "we demonstrate that the symmetry broken peps wavefunctions can be used to determine the spontaneous magnetization , and that they give rise to a local entanglement hamiltonian , in contrast to previous findings  @xcite , which establishes that all gapped phases can be assigned a short - ranged entanglement hamiltonian .",
    "let us start by introducing peps . w.l.o.g .",
    ", we restrict to a square lattice with @xmath5 sites .",
    "a peps model is described by a @xmath6-index tensor @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the physical dimension at each site and @xmath11 the _ bond dimension_. the peps wavefunction @xmath12 is obtained by arranging the tensors on the lattice and contracting the _ virtual indices _ @xmath13 of adjacent tensors as indicated by lines in fig .",

    "a peps can equally be considered as a quasi-1d tensor network ( a matrix product state , mps ) with tensors @xmath17 and bond dimension @xmath18 . in mps , a central role is played by the transfer operator @xmath19 ; in particular , @xmath20 appears in correlation functions at distance @xmath21 , whose decay is therefore governed by the spectrum of @xmath4 . for peps , @xmath4 has itself a 1d structure , cf .",
    "[ fig : peps]c .",
    "this leads to a more complex behavior , since in the thermodynamic limit the system grows simultaneously in both directions , and thus , the dimension of the space on which @xmath22 acts grows exponentially with the system size .",
    "let us now turn towards systems with on - site symmetries . in peps models ,",
    "symmetries are encoded locally in the tensor : a symmetry action @xmath23 on the physical level translates to an action @xmath24 on the virtual system in a way where it cancels out when contracting tensors , see fig .",

    "as we have seen , peps form a natural framework to model systems with on - site symmetries : by encoding the symmetry locally into the tensor , we obtain a local hamiltonian with the same symmetry which depends smoothly on the parameters of the tensor , and whose ground state wavefunction can be constructed from the very same tensor .",
    "however , we have also found that by changing parameters , such a model can undergo a phase transition to a symmetry broken phase .",
    "nevertheless , the peps wavefunction @xmath37 , which is the unique ground state of the system , remains invariant under the symmetry throughout the phase diagram , @xmath38 ; e.g. , for the ising peps at zero temperature ( @xmath39 ) , we have @xmath40 .",
    "this leads to the central question of this work : how can we characterize symmetry breaking in peps models , and how can we construct the distinct symmetry broken states starting from a single _ symmetric _ tensor @xmath1 ?",
    "let us for a moment leave aside peps models and consider the analogous question for general hamiltonians with a symmetry : generically , these systems have a unique finite volume ground state which therefore carries the full symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "since the average magnetization @xmath41 in those states is zero , the ordered phase is characterized through non - vanishing long - range order @xmath42 . in order to obtain the symmetry broken states , one couples the system to a small external field @xmath43 and considers the ground state @xmath44 , taking first the limit @xmath45 and subsequently @xmath46 ; if in the limit @xmath47 , one says that the system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    ".    how are these two notions of long - range order and spontaneous symmetry breaking related , and can one construct an approximate symmetry broken state for a finite system ? given a unique finite - volume ground state with long - range order such as @xmath48 and order parameter @xmath49 , one can construct an orthogonal state @xmath50 whose energy approaches the ground state as @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "a generic local perturbation will select a unique ground state from the space spanned by @xmath37 and @xmath52 , assuming a gap above .",
    "in fact , it can be proven that the only states which do not exhibit long - range order for any observable @xmath53 with @xmath54 , i.e. , which are stable under arbitrary perturbations and thus form the symmetry broken states , are @xmath55  @xcite ; this is , the symmetry broken states can be constucted from the symmetric ground state @xmath37 alone .",
    "it is straightforward to see from this argument that the value of the long - range order is just the spontaneous magnetization squared .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that the above argument relies on the validity of the perturbative treatment which can not be justified rigorously in the limit @xmath45 , as the _ total _ perturbation diverges , and in fact , the equality between the two notions of symmetry breaking and the values of the corresponding order parameters has not been proven rigorously except for very few cases such as the ising model  @xcite .    in the following , we will follow a very similar reasoning in order to relate long - range order and spontaneous symmetry breaking in peps , and in particular to show how to construct the set of symmetry - broken states ( i.e. , those which are stable under arbitrary local perturbations ) starting from a single object , namely the unique symmetric peps wavefunction @xmath37 and its associated symmetric tensor @xmath1 . here",
    ", a central role will be played by the one - dimensional transfer operator and in particular its spectral properties and eigenstates , partly taking the role of the hamiltonian in the preceding discussion .",
    "we will start by showing that long - range order in the wavefunction is closely related to an approximate degeneracy in the spectrum of the transfer operator .",
    "subsequently , we study the behavior of the transfer operator under perturbations , and we show that _ arbitrary _ perturbations induce a splitting of the degenerate subspace in a _ fixed _ basis ",
    "independent of the perturbation  which therefore describes the symmetry broken states of the model .    in the following discussion",

    "on an infinite cylinder , the spins are correlated at least over a distance proportional to the circumference .",
    "[ away from fixed point wavefunctions , we indeed can not expect correlations along the cylinder over arbitrary distances ; on the other hand , e.g.  in the ising peps correlations only break down after a distance @xmath63 . ]",
    "note that @xmath49 can depend on the lattice site , such as in the case of an antiferromagnet .",
    "in such a case , we will also have to restrict the possible values of @xmath15 accordingly , e.g.  to even numbers ( or we have to block tensors ) , and we will tacitly assume this in the following .",
