    "whenever a group of autonomous software agents or robots needs to decide on a joint course of action in a fair and satisfactory way , they need to aggregate their preferences . a common way to achieve this is to use voting rules .",
    "voting rules are studied in detail in social choice theory and are coming under increasing scrutiny from computer scientists who are interested in their computational properties or want to utilize them in multiagent systems ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in social choice theory , voting rules",
    "are usually compared using desirable properties ( so - called axioms ) that they may or may not satisfy .",
    "there are a number of well - known impossibility theorems ",
    "among which arrow s impossibility is arguably the most famous  which state that certain axioms are incompatible with each other .",
    "these results , which show the non - existence of voting rules that satisfy a given set of axioms , are important because they clearly define the boundary of what can be achieved at all .",
    "this applies to the explicitly stated axioms as well as implicit ones such as boundaries on the number of voters or alternatives .",
    "for instance , if there are only two alternatives , arrow s theorem does not apply and there are many voting rules , including majority rule , that satisfy the conditions used in arrow s theorem .",
    "one impossibility that requires unusually high bounds on the number of voters and alternatives is moulin s _ no - show paradox _ @xcite , which states that the axioms of condorcet - consistency and participation are incompatible whenever there are at least 4 alternatives and 25 voters .",
    "moulin proves that the bound on the number of alternatives is tight by showing that the maximin voting rule ( with lexicographic tie - breaking ) satisfies the desired properties when there are at most 3 alternatives .",
    "the tightness of the more restrictive condition on the number of voters was left open , however .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give tight bounds on the number of voters required for moulin s theorem and related theorems that appear in the literature . to achieve this , we encode these problems as formulas in propositional logic and then use sat solvers to decide their satisfiability and extract minimal unsatisfiable sets ( muses ) in the case of unsatisfiability",
    "this approach is based on previous work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . however , it turned out that a straightforward application of this methodology is insufficient to deal with the magnitude of the problems we considered .",
    "several novel techniques were necessary to achieve our results . in particular , we extracted knowledge from computer - generated proofs of weaker statements and then used this information to guide the search for proofs of more general statements .",
    "as mentioned above , moulin s theorem uses the axioms of condorcet - consistency and participation .",
    "condorcet - consistency goes back to one of the most influential notions in social choice theory , namely that of a _",
    "condorcet winner_. a condorcet winner is an alternative that is preferred to any other alternative by a majority of voters . the marquis de condorcet , after whom this concept is named , argued that , whenever a condorcet winner exists , it should be elected @xcite .",
    "a voting rule satisfying this condition is called _ condorcet - consistent_. apart from the intuitive appeal of this condition , condorcet - consistent rules are more robust to changes in the of feasible alternatives and less susceptible to strategic manipulation than other voting rules ( such as borda s rule ) ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the desirability of condorcet - consistency  as that of any other axiom  has been subject to criticism , many scholars agree that it is very appealing  if not indispensable  and a large part of the social choice literature deals exclusively with condorcet - consistent voting rules @xcite .",
    "_ participation _ was first considered by @xcite and requires that no voter should be worse off by joining an electorate , or  alternatively  that no voter should benefit by abstaining from an election .",
    "the desirability of this axiom in any context with voluntary participation is evident .",
    "all the more surprisingly , @xcite have shown that single transferable vote ( stv ) , a common voting rule , violates participation and referred to this phenomenon as the _ no - show paradox_. @xcite , perhaps even more startlingly , proved that no condorcet - consistent voting rule satisfies participation when there are at least 25 voters .",
    "we leverage sat solving to obtain an elegant human - readable proof of moulin s result that requires only 12 voters .",
    "while computer - aided solving techniques allow us to tackle difficult combinatorial problems , they usually do not provide additional insight into these problems .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the computer - aided proofs we found possess a certain kind of symmetry that has not been exploited in previous proofs .",
    "moreover , the sat solver is able to construct a condorcet - consistent voting rule that satisfies participation as well as a number of other desirable properties for up to 11 voters , proving the optimality of the above bound .",
    "this computer - generated voting rule is compatible with the maximin voting rule in 99.8% of all cases and , in contrast to maximin , only selects alternatives from the top cycle . as a practical consequence of our theorem , strategic abstention need",
    "not be a concern for condorcet - consistent voting rules when there are at most 4 alternatives and 11 voters , for instance when voting in a committee .",
    "we also use our techniques to provide optimal bounds for related results about set - valued and probabilistic voting rules @xcite .",
    "in particular , we give a tight bound of 17 voters for the optimistic preference extension , 14 voters for the pessimistic extension , and 12 voters for the stochastic dominance preference extension .",
    "these results are substantial improvements of previous results .",
    "for example , the previous statement for the pessimistic extension requires an additional axiom , at least 5 alternatives , and at least 971 voters @xcite .",

    "when assuming that voters have incomplete preferences over sets or lotteries , participation and condorcet - consistency can be satisfies simultaneously and positive results for common condorcet - consistent voting rules have been obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "note that for purposes of extracting human - readable proofs , it is desirable for the mus to be as small as possible , and also to refer to as few different tournaments as possible .",
    "the first issue can be addressed by running the mus extractor repeatedly , instructing it to order clauses randomly ( note that clause sets of different cardinalities can be minimally unsatisfiable with respect to set inclusion ) ; similarly , we can use marco to enumerate all muses and look for small ones .",
