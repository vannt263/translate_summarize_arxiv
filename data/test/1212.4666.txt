    "we have found limiting distributions for the rescaled nodal volume .",
    "the limiting distributions in the two paradigms have a very different character : for random waves we find a delta - function while the cuboid s limiting distribution has a finite support .",
    "it is consistent with berry s random wave conjecture that the distribution for all irregular shapes will be a delta function at @xmath154 ( see ) which only depends on the dimension and nothing else . for regular shapes other than the cuboid we may refer to the analogous calculations for nodal count distributions @xcite which showed that many features such as the types of singularities near the upper and lower end of the support are universal .",
    "we conjecture that the same is true for the nodal volume distributions studied here though the actual values for the upper and lower end of the support may be system dependent .",
    "one clear signature of irregular versus regular shapes is the behaviour of the fluctuations of rescaled nodal volumes as the energy increases . for irregular shapes",
    "one expects that the variance decreases while it remains finite and bounded for regular shapes .",
