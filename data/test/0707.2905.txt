    "in this section we describe our implementation of the accelerated monte carlo technique in the 2d non - lte line radiative transfer code art , which is part of the software package `` uran(ia ) '' aimed at modeling of various objects with different exact / approximate lrt methods .",

    ". however , in order to lower random noise and thus retain reliable accuracy of the results , monte carlo simulations typically require enormous amounts of computing time , especially for highly optically thick objects . in certain cases the numerically most demanding part of monte carlo codes ( ray tracing ) can be significantly optimized by special iterative schemes for the acceleration of convergence .",
    "the algorithm of our 2d non - lte line radiative transfer code art is fully described in @xcite and only briefly summarized here .",
    "in essence , this monte carlo code is based on the accelerated scheme originally proposed and implemented in the lrt code `` ratran '' by @xcite and in the modified monte carlo method of @xcite .",

    "first , the computational domain is split into cells .",
    "all physical quantities are assumed to be constant within each disk cell @xmath18 , except for the velocity that can vary . in the first iteration ,",
    "initial level populations and a set of photon random directions @xmath19 through the grid are defined ( this is the monte carlo part of the calculations ) . the same set of photon random directions is used in all subsequent iterations for accurate ray tracing , producing a solution free of random noise but with possible undersampling of directions and velocities .    using these values ,",
    "the line intensities @xmath20 are computed for each disk cell @xmath18 by explicit direct integration of the radiative transfer equation with the long characteristic method along the predefined set of photon rays @xmath19 , starting with the cmb field at the edge of the disk ( or interstellar radiation field , or anisotropic stellar radiation ) .",
    "the integration path is split into sub - intervals with a step that is smaller than the cell size .",
    "ideally , one would need to define this integration step based on local gradients of the physical conditions in the disk and the optical depth of the line . however , this is not easily achievable in practice , so an empirical value has to be used .",
    "we adopt a step size of 1/10 of the cell size in our computations .",
    "next , the resulting mean line intensity @xmath21 is calculated in each disk cell by spatial averaging of the derived intensities @xmath20 over directions @xmath19 and by averaging over the line profile .",
    "the computed mean intensities are utilized in the next iteration step to refine the level populations by solving the balance equations in all disk cells .",
    "the convergence of the integration procedure for optically thick lines can be substantially accelerated by additional internal sub - iterations similar to the accelerated lambda iterations ( ali ) scheme @xcite .",
    "the ali method employs the fact that the calculated mean line intensity at each particular grid cell can be separated into an internal component generated in the cell itself and an external contribution coming from other grid cells . as a result ,",
    "additional sub - iterations are applied to bring into an agreement the internal mean line intensity and the corresponding level populations in every grid cell .",
    "when these local sub - iterations converge , the global iterations over the entire grid are continued until the level populations in each cell do not differ by more than @xmath22% .",
    "note that this scheme may not be fully appropriate in cases of particularly thick lines with @xmath23 when such a simple convergence criterion fails , e.g. for water lines @xcite .",
    "after the final molecular level populations are obtained , the maximum random error associated with the monte carlo computations is estimated .",
    "for that all iterations are repeated again with another set of preselected random photon rays .",
    "we choose the number of random photon paths such that the relative error in the computed level populations is smaller than 1% .",
    "although the code is currently restricted to axially symmetric ( 2d ) radiative transfer problems in polar coordinates , it can be extended to problems with any number of dimensions and for any coordinate system .",
    "finally , these resulting level populations are used in the 3d ray tracing part of the `` uran(ia ) '' package to produce synthetic molecular line spectra , channel maps , integrated line intensity maps , velocity maps etc .",
    ", with an arbitrary number of velocity channels , and for any disk viewing geometry .",
    "beam convolution can be applied if needed .",
    "the `` uran(ia ) ''",
    "code was carefully benchmarked against other lrt codes by solving several one- and two - dimensional problems . in the one - dimensional regime ,",
    "the computed molecular level populations and excitation temperatures are fully consistent with all tests proposed during the conference on molecular radiative transfer ( leiden university , 1999 , see * ? ? ?",
    "several additional tests of our code were performed in 2d mode , using a few simple problems with analytically predictable solutions .",
    "in addition , together with m. hogerheijde  the developer of the two - dimensional lrt code `` ratran ''  we successfully compared the results for both codes for keplerian disks .",
    "the method of long characteristics is one of the most reliable algorithms to calculate the mean intensity and thus to obtain an accurate solution to the radiative transfer problem ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , a direct realization of this method is computationally expensive for multi - dimensional radiative transfer simulations .",
    "for example , to compute molecular level populations for a 2d disk model having 150 vertical and 50 radial grid points and 1000 photon packages per cell , one needs @xmath24  days of computational time on a modern pc ( pentium xeon 2.4  ghz , 1 gb ram ) .",
    "however , for certain cases the computational time needed for the ray tracing part can be efficiently reduced . to illustrate this for a rotating keplerian disk with radial velocity gradient , let us consider a cell at a given radius @xmath14 .",
    "the local line width that strongly depends on the temperature and microturbulent velocity in the cell is typically @xmath25",
    "kms@xmath7 , which is significantly smaller than the total velocity dispersion across the disk , @xmath26  kms@xmath7 . therefore , due to the doppler shift the photons emitted at a peak frequency in a cell rotating with a given velocity can only be absorbed locally by some of the neighboring cells having similar velocities ( the so - called `` interaction area '' ) .",
    "an example of such an interaction area is shown in fig .",
    "[ interac ] , where regions of the keplerian disk that are radiatively coupled to the cell located at @xmath27  au ( white spot in the figure ) are shown in black .",
    "we modified the ray - tracing algorithm used in the rt solver of `` uran(ia ) '' such that the iterative integration of the rt equation is only performed over the radiatively coupled regions of the disk . during the first iteration the radiatively coupled regions for each cell are identified using the full ray tracing and stored in a file .",
    "this information is utilized during the next iterations to integrate the rt equation over the radiatively coupled regions only .",
    "note that the radiatively coupled region will be different for each line of each of the considered molecules .",
    "however , for those molecules for which the local lines widths are dominated by non - thermal motions ( e.g. , microturbulence ) this difference will be small .",
    "this modification preserves the flexibility of the accelerated monte carlo approach and allows to decrease the computation time for protoplanetary disks by about one order of magnitude and more , retaining the same high level of accuracy .",
    "one may use an analytical prescription instead of the preliminary ray tracing , but such a prescription will be model - dependent and thus can not be easily generalized .",
    "though our concept of the interaction areas in rotating configurations somewhat resembles the idea of the approximate lvg method ( see sect .",
    "[ lvg ] ) , it leads to an _ exact _ solution of the lrt problem .",
    "the densities in the disk interior are so high that the low level populations of many molecules are thermalized .",
    "naturally , the thermalized disk cells can be effectively excluded from the global iteration calculations since the radiative effects do not play a role in populating the levels .",
    "we use the following approach to determine whether a disk cell is thermalized or not .",
    "first , the level populations in the disk are calculated using the simple lte and full escape probability ( fep ) approaches ( see next section ) .",
    "these two approximate methods represent two extreme cases to the solution of the lrt problem .",
    "the lte approach tends to overestimate while fep method tends to underestimate the populations of high levels in the case of radiative coupling .",
    "the cell is supposed to be thermalized if the relative difference between the corresponding lte and fep level populations is smaller than an adopted threshold of 10@xmath2810@xmath29 .",
    "this modification leads to an additional computational acceleration of about 10% for hco@xmath1 and 30% for co and co isotopes .",
    "in this section , we summarize the approximate lrt methods that will be compared with the results of the monte carlo simulations from the art code . a schematic overview and comparison of the utilized lrt approaches is given in table  [ lrt_methods_table ] .      in the case of local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte )",

    "there are two general situations when lte holds : 1 ) the hydrogen density is substantially higher than the critical density of a transition , or 2 ) the optical depth of a transition is so high that a perfect equilibrium between the collisional and radiative ( de-)excitations is reached .",
    "the lte approach is appropriate for the lower rotational transitions of co and its isotopologues ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been used in the analysis of molecular line data even if the conditions for its applicability are not fully justified because it is the easiest lrt method to implement ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another extreme is to assume that a transition has a very low optical depth , so that the newly generated photons escape the disk freely , without any further interaction with the medium . or , by other words , in the fep approach the escape probability @xmath37 is not calculated and always set to 1 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under such conditions",
    "the lrt problem becomes local and can be easily solved .",
    "the full escape probability ( fep ) level populations are obtained as a solution of the statistical equilibrium equations with the mean intensity @xmath38 substituted by the mean external radiation field , e.g. cmb : @xmath39 . as in the lte case , the fep approach requires only very little computational time .",
    "fep can be an adequate method for molecules with very low abundances .      in some objects such as expanding stellar envelopes or galaxies",
    ", radial velocity gradients can be much larger than the local thermal and microturbulent velocities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this case the photons that are emitted by a certain region can only be absorbed locally .",

    "[ interac ] , the size of the radiatively coupled zone is significantly smaller than the entire disk plane .",
    "therefore , one may expect the lvg approach to be efficient for the line radiative transfer modeling .    in the lvg method , the mean intensity @xmath38 in a disk cell",
    "is approximated by a combination of the source function @xmath42 for a given transition and the external radiation field @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath37 is the probability for the photons to freely escape the medium , @xmath45 .",
    "the escape probability @xmath37 is usually expressed in the form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the effective line optical depth because of the local velocity gradient .",
    "note that for optically thin lines the escape probability @xmath37 reaches unity and the lvg method turns into the fep approach .",
    "the effective optical depth @xmath47 is evaluated as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the local absorption coefficient and @xmath50 is the coherence length i.e. the mean distance for a photon to escape the medium .",

    "the photons emitted in a disk cell at a radius @xmath51 can not escape in the radial direction @xmath52 since there is no velocity shift in this direction .",
    "instead , we assume that the photons can only escape in the tangential direction . ideally , one would need to apply spatial averaging to get a correct value of the coherence length , but this would significantly complicate the realization of the lvg method .    the approximate coherence length can be expressed via the local line width and the keplerian velocity .",
    "the velocity shift along the coherence path is , by definition , equal to the local line width @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the keplerian velocities at the distances of @xmath51 and @xmath57 , respectively , and @xmath58 is the corresponding angle between the velocity vectors ( fig .",

    "this approach is adopted in our lvg method .",
    "it typically takes only several seconds of cpu time to calculate the molecular level populations with the lvg approach .",
    "one has to keep in mind that in our disk models there is no velocity gradient in the vertical direction and the disk cells are radiatively coupled in vertical direction , while in the lvg approach , the disk is effectively decoupled in independent parallel planes .",

    "therefore , the radiative effects in vertical and radial directions are comparable over the entire keplerian disk ( at least around the disk mid - plane ) and , by design , the lvg method can only partly account for the radiative coupling",
    ".    to better illustrate the role of radiative coupling in vertical and radial directions , we computed with art the ratio between tangential and vertical optical depths for the uniform disk model ( see fig .  [ tau_ratio ] ) .",
    "the typical value of this ratio is only about a few over the entire disk , so both directions are important for the line radiative transfer . using art , we also calculated the mean coherence lengths in the equatorial plane of the disk .",

    "the calculated mean and individual coherence lengths are compared to the values from eq .",
    "( [ coherent ] ) in fig .",
    "[ av_coh_length ] .",
    "as can be clearly seen , our analytical expression reproduces well the radial dependence of the mean coherence length , but a number of the individual lengths have larger values because of the photon trapping along directions with zero doppler shifts . as a result , the mean value of the coherence length is typically about 10 times longer than predicted by eq .",
    "( [ coherent ] ) .    however , the excitation conditions vary so greatly over the mean coherence length that it can not be directly put into eqs .",
    "( [ eqlvg1 ] ) and ( [ eqlvg2 ] ) . in order to properly evaluate",
    "the total escape probability @xmath37 one has to average individual escape probabilities rather than the coherence lengths .",
    "this requires information about exact physical parameters along all coupled directions , which makes this approach non - local and thus far too complicated .    in the lvg approximation",
    "the coherence length is determined by the velocity gradients resulting from the keplerian rotation of the disk . however , as we have shown above the radial radiative coupling is comparable to the coupling in vertical direction .",
    "one can assume that the vertical radiative coupling is more important than the radial coupling , which leads to significant simplification of the radiative transfer .",
    "this idea is utilized in the vep method where photons are assumed to escape only in the vertical direction perpendicular to the disk plane .",
    "a simple correction is made to take into account the large asymmetry between the two opposite escape directions : the escape probability is computed by taking the sum of escape probability upwards and downwards : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the optical depth towards the disk surface ( upward opacity ) , and @xmath75 is the optical depth through the disk midplane ( downward opacity ) .",
    "the optical depth in upward and downward directions is calculated using the local excitation conditions and the molecular surface densities along the corresponding directions .",
    "note that this assumption is rather coarse in the presence of strong vertical gradients of physical conditions .",
    "similar to lvg , in the vep approach the escape probability , source function , and the local optical depth are obtained iteratively .",
    "however , the direct implementation of the iterative vep approach can be dangerous for disk cells with negative excitation temperature .",
    "in vep these local conditions are extrapolated over the total vertical extent of the disk and the resulting optical depth can be negative and large .",
    "this leads to the physically unrealistic situation that the escape probability can become large , especially during the iterations required to solve the statistical equilibrium equations and the vep method may fail to converge . to avoid this problem",
    ", we control the downward line optical depth @xmath75 such that it can not become negative .",
    "the upward optical depth is allowed to remain negative , in order to represent weak inversions at the surface layers .",
    "the method was initially developed in the diskfit software package ( see section 4.6 ) .",
    "like fep , the vep method takes only a few seconds of cpu time to solve the lrt problem ( see table  [ lrt_methods_table ] ) .      in the lte and fep methods",
    "radiative coupling effects are completely ignored , while in the lvg and vep approach radiative trapping is only partially treated .",
    "since there is no vertical velocity gradient in the adopted disk model , the cells are generally radiatively coupled in vertical direction .",
    "furthermore , fig.[interac ] shows that , with the exception of a relatively narrow cone in the radial direction , a given cell in the disk is only coupled with cells at the same radius , i.e. with regions with the same 1d structure .    using these ideas ,",
    "we construct a non - local approximate lrt method in which the radiative coupling in only the vertical direction is taken into account ( `` vor ''  vertical one ray method ) .",
    "this simplifying assumption allows to use a 1d approach for calculating the mean line intensity @xmath38 in a disk cell : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the intensities of the radiation coming along vertical direction from the top and bottom of the disk , respectively . to further accelerate this method ,",
    "only one central frequency for each emission line is taken into account .",
    "this non - local rt problem is finally solved using only 2 photon paths along vertical direction for the ray tracing .",
    "computational demands of the 1d vor method are much less than those of the exact 2d code art",
    ". it usually takes about a few minutes of cpu time to obtain the level populations .",
    "note that our vor approach is another implementation of the feautrier method ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and resembles the 1d scheme of @xcite .",
    "the 1d methods have been used to represent spheres as well as infinite planes . in the latter case , an eddington factor of 3",
    "is used to take into account the mean opacity over all possible angles . in our case , since the interaction only occurs in a ring centered around the star , the eddington factor should be smaller .",
    "we have simply used the eddington factor of 1 , like for a sphere .",
    "the described approximate methods are included in the `` uran(ia ) '' package . in our study",
    "we also used another software package `` diskfit '' .",
    "the program diskfit allows to model line radiative transfer in disks using various approximate methods as well as to reconstruct basic disk parameters using an advanced @xmath79-minimization scheme in the @xmath80-plane @xcite .",
    "the program offers three possibilities to solve the coupled equations of statistical equilibrium and rt : lte , vep , and a non - local 1d approach .",
    "the latter is based on the feautrier scheme @xcite and is an adaptation to the disk geometry of the code developed by @xcite for the line radiative transfer modeling of interstellar clouds .",
    "this 1d method is thus similar to vor , but uses several frequency points across the line profile .",
    "the eddington factor may also be adjusted if needed .",
    "once the level populations are derived , the interferometric visibilities as well as beam - convolved channel maps can be computed using the 3d ray tracing part @xcite .",
    "any arbitrary orientations of the disk defined by the inclination and position angles can be used . for that , a three dimensional regular grid is used , with additional refinement for the central disk region where the surface brightness gradient is very strong .",
    "the diskfit radiative transfer methods and the ray tracing part were thoroughly compared against those implemented in the `` uran(ia ) '' package and good overall agreement was achieved for the disk level populations and spectral maps for both the optically thin and thick molecular transitions .",
    "therefore , for the rest of the paper we compare approximate and exact lrt methods from the `` uran(ia ) '' package only .",
    "prior to the detailed comparison of various radiative transfer methods described above , we discuss the problem of molecular line formation and excitation conditions in disks in general .",
    "since the thermal and density structure of protoplanetary disks is in relatively well understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can discriminate distinct regimes of line formation .    a particular rotational transition is excited when the molecular hydrogen density exceeds a critical density @xmath81 : @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the einstein coefficient and @xmath84 are the collisional rates from the upper level @xmath85 to all other lower levels @xmath18 .",
    "the density , @xmath86 , at which the molecular levels become predominantly populated by collisions and thus are thermalized is typically about one order of magnitude higher than the critical density .",
    "we will further refer to @xmath86 as to the thermalization density .",
    "consequently , the disk can be roughly divided in two regions . in the so - called `` super - critical '' region near the disk midplane , where the density is larger than the thermalization density ,",
    "molecular level populations follow the boltzmann distribution and the excitation temperature is equal to the kinetic temperature , @xmath87 . in this region",
    "a simple lte approach can be safely utilized .    in the upper , more diffuse `` sub - critical '' region of the disk the line excitation",
    "is partly controlled by collisions and partly by internal / external radiation .",

    "when the column density is so low that the sub - critical region is fully transparent to the internal radiation , the corresponding molecular levels are mostly radiatively populated and therefore subthermally excited : @xmath88 is the temperature of the background radiation , e.g. 2.73  k for the cmb field ] . in this case",
    "a simple full escape probability approximation can be used ( see section  [ results ] ) .",
    "the characteristics of the emergent molecular line spectrum will depend on the relative contribution from each of the super - critical and sub - critical regions .",

    "in this situation three distinct regimes of line excitation can be distinguished .    in the first , and most simple case",
    "the molecular layer is located deeply inside the super - critical density region and the molecular level populations are in lte ( see left panel in fig .",

    "good examples of that kind are the lower rotational transitions of co and its isotopologues @xcite .    in the second case ,",
    "the molecular layer is entirely confined within the sub - critical density region .",
    "the distribution of the level populations will then depend on the molecular column density as discussed above ( middle panel , fig .",

    "the radiative transfer problem has to be tackled with a more sophisticated non - local method .",

    "in this situation the lte approach does not work , whereas the fep approximation is valid only if the optical depth of the sub - critical layer is low and the molecular emission is dominated by the super - critical ( thermalized ) layer .",
    "the lower rotational lines of e.g. hco@xmath1 , hcn , and cs are likely excited in such a way",
    ".    if the molecular column densities are so large that the sub - critical region becomes optically thick for internal radiation , the simple fep approach fails and non - local radiative transfer modeling is required .",
    "the non - lte effects in disks are likely important for the rotational lines of complex species , e.g. h@xmath2co , but may also be important for higher transitions of many other simple molecules ( such as hcn , cs , etc . ) . in the next section",
    "we verify whether non - lte effects are important in protoplanetary disks and for which molecular transitions this is the case .",

    "when the chemical structure is not known , one can use uniform abundance distributions with the abundance values taken from theoretical models .    using the density and chemical structure of the disk and molecular data as input , one can determine the line optical depth and the amounts of emitting molecules in the sub- and super - critical regions . as discussed in section",

    "[ texc ] , left panels ) . in this part",
    "the ( self-)radiation is not intense , and the levels are excited and de - excited by collisions but only radiatively de - excited .",
    "consequently , lte is not longer valid and collisional pumping of the rotational level populations appears as a result of a specific ratio between radiative and collisional ( de)-excitation probabilities .",
    "such inversion is characteristic of some linear molecules like cs , hco@xmath1 , and sio and requires high temperatures and a specific density range @xcite .",

    "as soon as the line opacity and thus the self - radiation becomes significant , the stimulated radiative transitions depopulate the upper levels and destroy the inversion . note that in the fep approximation the effect of self - radiation is completely neglected and therefore the negative excitation temperature zone is strongly overestimated ( fig .",

    "another non - lte zone corresponds to the subthermally excited sub - critical disk region , which occupies a significant disk volume for high hco@xmath1 transitions .    to quantify the difference between the excitation temperature @xmath101 computed with an approximate and the exact art methods",

    "consequently , the global accuracy @xmath108 of an approximate method over the entire disk can be evaluated with the following expression : @xmath109 where the absolute values of the local errors @xmath110 are summed over the optically thin disk cells and weighted by the number of molecules @xmath111 in each cell .",

    "fep is also accurate for ( 7 - 6 ) transition ( @xmath124 ) , since it works in the large optically thin region that is decoupled from the internal radiation .",

    "in particular , the maser zone in the disk is well reproduced by lvg and vor .",
    "the lvg approach shows the same tendency for the excitation temperature deviations as fep because it underestimates the radiative coupling .",
    "the non - local vor approach gives the most accurate results for all considered transitions since it treats the radiative transfer in vertical direction , where velocity gradients are absent in our model .",
    "a minor problem of vor is the overestimation of the photon trapping in the very upper disk regions where the radiation can escape also in other directions .",
    "in general , for the uniform hco@xmath1 model and all considered transitions fep and lte are not accurate lrt methods ( `` c '' grade ) , while lvg and vep are acceptable ( `` b '' ) , and vor is good ( `` a '' ) .",

    "the fep intensity is 3 times higher for the face - on orientation and even higher for the inclined disk .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , this is due to the maser effect in the first two hco@xmath1 level populations .",

    "however , for the higher hco@xmath1 transitions the fep spectra are in better agreement with the full monte carlo simulations , whereas lte tends to significantly overestimate the line intensities .",
    "this is because the size of the radiatively coupled part is decreasing for higher transitions , having higher thermalization densities and thus a more extended sub - critical region where @xmath129 ( compare top panels in fig .  [ texc_rel ] ) .    at",
    "face - on disk orientation a self - absorption dip arises in the ( 4 - 3 ) and ( 7 - 6 ) art spectra at the central velocity channels .",
    "this dip is caused by absorption of emitted radiation in the upper disk region , at @xmath130cm@xmath28 , due to the vertical excitation temperature gradient ( fig .",
    "[ texc ] ) . both lte and fep fail to accurately reproduce this effect .",
    "in contrast , the double - peaked hco@xmath1 spectra of the inclined disk are not due to self - absorption but appear as a result of the beam convolution over disk cells with different projected velocity . in this case all approximate methods correctly predict the shape of the line profiles .",

    "the overall agreement between the different lrt methods becomes better ( see also table  [ applic_methods_chem ] ) .",
    "still , lte fails for higher transitions . the detailed comparison for the other species considered here yields similar results .",
    "the criterion @xmath108 that gives a global accuracy estimate for the excitation temperature calculated with an approximate lrt method is also valid for the single - dish spectra . to investigate how good this criterion is for the synthetic spectral maps , we plot the hco@xmath1(4 - 3 ) map at the 0.68kms@xmath7 velocity channel for the same @xmath131-inclined disk , but without beam convolution ( fig .

    "however , the spectral images show a more complicated pattern that resemble two thick elliptical rings overlaid on each other with an angular shift of about @xmath132 and fixed at the center .",
    "the three low - intensity lanes correspond to the disk region close to the midplane that is devoid of hco@xmath1 emission at the chosen velocity channel of 0.68kms@xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the hco@xmath1 ions are also absent in the disk upper layer and the overall extension of the map is smaller in vertical direction compared to the uniform model .",
    "our analysis of the line radiative transfer in protoplanetary disks supports and extends the analysis performed by @xcite . in particular",
    ", they argued that se(@xmath133=0 ) calculations ( in our notation fep ) provide better agreement with se calculations ( in our notation art ) compared to lte .",
    "according to our results , the fep method is indeed more correct than lte for the upper molecular transitions which were considered by @xcite .",
    "however , the fep approach may give completely wrong intensities for the lowest molecular transitions such as @xmath134 and @xmath135 since it overestimates the maser effect , resulting from the specific ratio between collisional ( de)excitation rates .",
    "hence , the lte approach provides more reliable intensities of the lowest transitions than the fep method .",
    "however , lte fails to reproduce important features of the line profiles like the self - absorption dips .",
    "despite the fact that either lte or fep can be sufficient for the simulations of the particular molecular lines , we recommend to use lvg or vep since they provide in general better agreement at the same cost of complexity and cpu requirement . the more exact , but more time - consuming methods such as vor or art",
    "can be used to check the validity of the above approximate methods .",
    "an interesting result of our study is the fact that the synthetic images calculated with vep are quite close to the exact art spectra , for both chemically uniform and layered models .",
    "this may look surprising since the idea of the vep method is to use local excitation conditions and to extrapolate them along the vertical direction to calculate escape probabilities .",
    "thus , one may expect that this `` homogeneous '' approach is inappropriate for the disk models with their strong gradients of physical conditions and molecular abundances .",
    "the `` good behavior '' of vep is a consequence of the very strong ( vertical ) density gradient compared to the temperature gradient . in the layered disk model molecules are concentrated in thin layers where physical conditions do not change much in vertical direction . in the uniform disk model",
    "the strong vertical density gradients result in a super - critical region around the midplane where molecular emission is thermalized , while emission from a low - density surface layer is negligible . in between lies a narrow sub - critical disk region , where molecular opacities can be high enough to affect the emergent spectra ( see sect .  [ line_form ] ) . for optically thin lines ,",
    "the contribution of this narrow layer to the emission is small . for optically thick lines ,",
    "the likelihood that the line opacity reaches about unity in this region is very low .",

    "in contrast to our vep approach , in mep the probability for photons to escape a cell is computed in 3d , by spatial averaging of the optical depths over several ( 6 ) directions . due to its 3d nature",
    ", mep may treat more consistently the photon escape from complicated radiatively coupled regions in keplerian disks ( see fig .",
    "[ interac ] ) than our vertical escape probability method . since the 1d vep approach already reasonably accurate in most cases , the use of 3d mep for the lrt modeling of protoplanetary disks is recommended in situations when even higher accuracy is required at the expense of extra cpu costs for the spatial averaging .",
    "another recent 1d escape probability method has been derived by @xcite . their coupled escape probability ( cep )",
    "approach is based on mathematical transformation of the coupled system of the integro - differential rt equation and linear balance equations into one system of implicit non - linear equations .",
    "due to fast convergence of this implicit scheme , cep gains about 12 orders of magnitude in computational speed compared to conventional ali schemes .",
    "however , this method can not be easily adapted to multidimensional lrt problems with multi - level molecules because of the mathematical `` trick '' that lies behind its algorithm .",
    "taken at face value , in 1d geometry , it would be conceptually similar to , but more sophisticated than the 1d feautrier approach implemented in our vor method .    in the present study we did not consider molecules with complex level structure , e.g. molecules with hyperfine components since they require more detailed investigations .",
    "for instance , @xcite used new collisional rates to simulate the n@xmath2h@xmath1 lines from prestellar cores and showed that the usual assumption that n@xmath2h@xmath1 sub - level populations follow the boltzmann distribution may lead to significant errors in the intensities of the hyperfine lines .",
    "@xcite mentioned severe problems in lrt simulations of h@xmath2o lines .",
    "apparently , the formation of such complex molecular lines in protoplanetary disks requires a more extended analysis which has to be based on the appropriate collisional rates .    in the present paper",
    ", we also did not treat the effects of dust emission on the line formation . for the protoplanetary disks the dust emission at millimeter wavelengths is negligible compared to the molecular transitions .",
    "however , at shorter wavelengths the dust emission may be sufficiently strong to excite upper molecular transitions and , therefore , should be considered .    nor did we include the effects of vertical mixing and turbulence in our model . from a chemical point of view , turbulent diffusion acts as an efficient non - thermal desorption mechanism and smoothes molecular abundance gradients in disks @xcite . consequently , the results for such a disk model would be in between the results for our uniform and layered chemical models .",
    "we analyzed the line radiative transfer and the formation of rotational lines of several key molecules ( co , cs , hco@xmath1 , h@xmath2co , hcn ) in protoplanetary disks .",
    "a detailed model of the disk physical structure with vertical temperature gradient and uniform / layered chemical structure is used .",
    "we used the exact accelerated monte carlo code art and compare the results with several approximate lrt approaches , including lte , the full escape probability ( fep ) , lvg , and the vertical escape probability method ( vep ) and a 1d non - local code vor .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "prior to any modeling of the radiative transfer , one can roughly estimate the importance of non - lte effects for the line excitation and thus choose an appropriate approximate or exact method by using critical column density ( ccd ) diagrams .",
    "the basic idea of the ccd diagrams is to calculate and compare the amount of emitting molecules in the sub- and super - critical regions , taking into account the optical depth of the line . with ccd diagrams we found that the upper disk layers are subthermally excited for many molecular lines , in particular for the upper transitions . 2 .   by comparing excitation temperatures ,",
    "synthesized spectra , and spectral maps we demonstrate that the simple lte and fep methods work reasonably well for chemically stratified disks where molecules are located mainly in the warm intermediate layer or in the disk midplane , but are not always accurate for disk models with uniform abundances . in contrast , the lvg , vep , and especially vor methods take the radiative coupling in the disks into account and thus accurately reproduce the line intensities and profiles . since the lvg and vep methods are computationally inexpensive , their use is recommended .",
    "we found a possibility to accelerate the ray - tracing part of the rt solver in monte - carlo method for rotating disks . in this modification the ray tracing is only performed over radiatively coupled disk zones , leading to a computational speed gain by factors of 1050 .",
    "this work is only the first step in our systematic analysis of the line radiative transfer in protoplanetary disks .",
    "the excitation of molecules with complex level structure , including hyperfine line components , and the applicability of various approximate lrt methods for the @xmath79-minimization fitting of the observational data will be addressed in future studies .",
