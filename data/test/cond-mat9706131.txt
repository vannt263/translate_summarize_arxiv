    "sapphire @xmath1al@xmath2o@xmath3 is a technologically important material with a variety of @xmath4 surface reconstructions . upon heating in uhv ,",
    "the nonreconstructed @xmath5 surface is stable up to @xmath6 1250 c. above this temperature , oxygen gradually evaporates whereas al stays on the surface @xcite . as a consequence , the surface first reconstructs to @xmath7 rotated by 30@xmath8 ( or @xmath9 , as reported by gautier et al @xcite ) , then to @xmath10 rotated by 30@xmath8 and finally , after @xmath6 20 minutes at 1350 c , to the @xmath11 structure @xcite .",
    "it is this last reconstruction which will be the subject of the present paper .",
    "the leed pattern was first investigated by french and somorjai @xcite who found a cubic al - rich surface structure over the hexagonal - symmetry bulk .",
    "more recently , vermeersch et al .",
    "@xcite obtained the same reconstruction after evaporating up to @xmath12 ml of al on clean non - reconstructed sapphire surface .",
    "gautier et al .",
    "@xcite measured the electron energy loss spectra and found a small hump in the sapphire band gap region .",
    "this hump is an indication of metallic character of the al - rich surface layer .",
    "renaud et al .",
    "@xcite made very precise grazing - incidence x - ray diffraction ( gixd ) measurements and were the first to propose a possible atomic structure of the @xmath13 structure .",
    "however , the fourier transform of the gixd provides the patterson map and not the real - space atomic structures .",
    "the lateral positions of al atoms in the disordered regions could not be uniquely determined .",
    "in addition , the gixd measurements could not tell the altitude of individual atoms above the substrate .",
    "nevertheless , renaud et al .",
    "@xcite found that the al overlayer forms a hexagonal domain pattern .",
    "al atoms are ordered in two compact ( 111 ) planes of an fcc lattice , characteristic of metallic al monolayers , within the domains and highly disordered in the `` domain walls '' between them . whereas the origin of the domain pattern was attributed to the lattice misfit between al overlayer and the substrate , the reason for the @xmath14 rotation was less clear .",
    "interestingly enough , evaporation of two topmost planes of oxygens from sapphire crystal leaves behind 5 al atoms per surface unit cell , very close to the density observed by renaud et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a mechanism of rotational reconstruction was proposed theoretically by novaco and mctague @xcite and confirmed experimentally for several systems , including rare gases ( physisorbed ) and alkali metals ( chemisorbed ) on graphite @xcite and metals on metals @xcite . in the novaco and mctague model ,",
    "rotational reconstruction was attributed to lattice misfit combined with weak coupling between the overlayer and the substrate .",
    "this caused a weak sinusoidal lateral distortion of the overlayer lattice .",
    "interestingly enough , rotational reconstruction was observed for lattice misfits as large as 15 % @xcite .    rotational reconstruction on sapphire , on the other hand , is different and can not be completely explained by the novaco - mctague model .",
    "the origin of the reconstruction is still the lattice misfit between the overlayer and the substrate , but now the distortion seems to be so strong that some atoms in the domain walls have lower coordination",
    ". this strong disorder could be the consequence of strong overlayer  substrate interactions and not of large lattice misfit .",
    "for the @xmath15 reconstruction the misfit between the sapphire bulk and the al metal overlayer is only @xmath16 % and is substantially less than in some other rotationally reconstructed systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction is strong also for some other rotationally reconstructed systems like cs chemisorbed on graphite @xcite .",
    "there is another important difference between the reconstructed sapphire and other systems : the overlayer on sapphire is composed of two monolayers @xcite whereas in the other systems , it is composed of only one monolayer . evidently , the origin of rotational reconstruction and of strong disorder in the domain walls is not clear .    in this paper",
    "we report on a simulation of the @xmath15 rotational reconstruction of sapphire with the aim of better understanding the processes of rotational reconstruction on the sapphire and similar surfaces and to help resolve some of the above open questions .",
    "the unit cell of clean , nonreconstructed sapphire ( 0001 ) surface is shown in fig .",
    "[ nrsurf ] . it is terminated with an al plane with one al atom per surface unit cell ( black disc ; @xmath17 of a compact monolayer ( ml ) coverage ) @xcite . also shown ( shaded discs )",
    "are al atoms which have to be added to get one unexpanded compact monolayer , in register with sapphire .",
    "= 8truecm    5truemm    the reconstructed surface unit cell has about 157 al atoms in the overlayer @xcite , so one has to simulate rather large surface unit cells .",
    "this is possible only with efficient potentials , therefore we describe the interaction between the overlayer atoms with the semi - empirical sutton - chen potential @xcite which has been also used in studying surface properties , including reconstruction , of fcc metals @xcite .",
    "these potentials are many - body potentials with elements of two - body terms in it and are written in the form :    @xmath18    ( @xmath19 is the separation between the atoms @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) . the first term in ( [ alpot ] )",
    "represents the core repulsion potential and the second term the bonding energy mediated by the electrons .",
    "@xmath22 is an effective local electron density at the site @xmath20 and is written as : @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 are parameters of the model which , together with the exponents @xmath26 and @xmath27 , determine the repulsive and cohesive energies , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 is the lattice constant of an al fcc crystal .",
    "sutton and chen @xcite published the following values for the potential parameters of al : @xmath29 we truncated the potential continuously ( with a fifth order polynomial ) between @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the nearest - neighbour distance ) . in this way",
    "the cutoff is between the 10@xmath33 and 11@xmath33 shells of neighbours .",
    "that meant that interaction with 68 neighbours were included if al were perfectly ordered in two fcc(111 ) planes . with this set of parameters ,",
    "the cohesive energy in the bulk al is 3.313 ev / atom , compared to 3.34 ev / atom in @xcite .",
    "the difference comes from different cutoff radii .",
    "the origin of bonding is in the electrons of the overlayer . on the reconstructed surface ,",
    "there are about 5 al atoms per nonreconstructed unit cell , on the average .",
    "each al atom has two @xmath34 and one @xmath35 electrons which all contribute to the cohesive energy . out of these 5 atoms ,",
    "one is already present on the non - reconstructed surface and is ionically bound to the sapphire substrate .",
    "this reduces the effective density of the electrons in the conduction band by @xmath36 and thus scales the constant @xmath37 in equation  ( [ alpot ] ) by a factor @xmath38 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath39 ev ) .",
    "@xmath37 can be additionally reduced by the charge transfer between the metallic overlayer and the insulating substrate  @xcite .",
    "it is not known how strong the charge transfer is , therefore we treated the constant @xmath25 as an adjustable parameter .",
    "the interaction between the overlayer and the substrate was modelled by a simple periodic potential .",
    "the substrate is much stiffer than the al overlayer , therefore the relaxation of the substrate caused by the overlayer was neglected in the simulations .",
    "the substrate potential was expanded in a power series and only the six lowest - order terms were retained , similarly as in the studies of noble gases on graphite , @xmath40 @xmath41 are the unit vectors in the plane of the surface , and @xmath42 the substrate lattice constant .",
    "@xmath43 controls the lateral modulation of the potential , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , \\label{u_lj}\\ ] ] its @xmath46dependence , in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "this dependence is necessary because the overlayer is more than one monolayer thick . in the lennard - jones potential ( [ u_lj ] ) ,",
    "@xmath47 is the depth of the substrate potential and @xmath48 determines the position of the minimum and the width of the potential in the vertical direction .",
    "thus , the overlayer  substrate potential is described by three variational parameters , @xmath49 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "= 8truecm    5truemm    this potential , shown in fig [ sub_pot ] , has six equally deep minima around each topmost oxygen atom of sapphire substrate .",
    "the potential ( [ usub ] ) is not deeper on the sites , already occupied by al atoms on the unreconstructed ( 0001 ) surface .",
    "this simplification is backed by a careful inspection of the real - space overlayer structure obtained from the diffraction data @xcite . during the process of reconstruction",
    ", the original al atoms also moved to other positions .",
    "they are not stronger bound than any other al atoms coming to the surface during oxygen evaporation .",
    "we simulated a box with the base plane of @xmath50 .",
    "such a rectangle accommodates exactly two reconstructed surface unit cells under periodic boundary conditions for the overlayer and substrate .",
    "the in - plane symmetry axis of the substrate is rotated with respect to the rectangle by @xmath51 . in the initial configurations",
    "the al atoms were put on two planes and positioned close to the positions found by renaud et al .",
    "we started with this configuration because of the problems with metastability .",
    "our results have been compared with the gixd result of renaud et al .",
    "@xcite who found 157 adatoms in a surface unit cell , distributed in two monolayers . in their analysis , however , some atomic sites could have been only partially occupied .",
    "therefore we performed simulations with the number of al atoms in the overlayer varying from 302 to 318 adatoms ( in two unit cells ) .    for a given set of the potential parameters @xmath25 , @xmath49 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ,",
    "the equilibrium al atomic positions were calculated by the energy minimization . once the atomic positions were determined , we calculated the corresponding diffraction pattern , given by the structure factors @xmath52 of the bragg peaks at @xmath53 , and compared it with the experimental @xmath54 @xcite . to evaluate the quality of the fit we first scaled @xmath52 with a factor @xmath55 and then calculated the residue , introduced as @xmath56 ^ 2                           \\over \\sum_q [ s_e(\\vec{q})]^2}.\\ ] ] the scaling factor @xmath55 was chosen to minimise the residue @xmath57 : @xmath58 \\over \\sum_q [ s_c(\\vec{q})]^2}.\\ ] ] summation over the first @xmath59 nonequivalent diffraction peaks in the reciprocal space",
    "was performed .",
    "the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath49 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 were then varied to find the minimal @xmath57 .    in the process of relaxation towards the ( local ) minimum energy configuration with the lowest residue , severe problems with hysteresis and local energy minima ( metastability ) were encountered .",
    "this is not too surprising since the `` domain wall '' region is full of lattice defects . to avoid trapping in a metastable state , the relaxed structure",
    "was shaken randomly and relaxed again .",
    "the best agreement between the calculated and experimental diffraction patterns was found , and the most extensive simulations have been done for the structure with 314 adatoms ( 157 per reconstructed surface unit cell ) .",
    "= 14truecm    5truemm    the best fit between with 314 atoms was obtained for @xmath60 the energy of this structure is @xmath61 ev / adatom .",
    "the average core repulsion energy between the adatoms is @xmath62 ev , the bonding energy between them is @xmath63 ev , and the average interaction energy with the substrate is @xmath64 ev .    the real - space structure with the best fit is seen in fig .",
    "[ rec_struc ] .",
    "comparison of the real - space structures obtained from the simulation and from the gixd shows that the simulated structure is substantially more ordered and that the simulated disordered regions , domain walls are broader and less pronounced .",
    "the two domains in the simulated box do not have the same structure after relaxation although their initial configurations were identical .",
    "this is an indication of many metastable states in the disordered regions .",
    "= 12truecm    5truemm    the residue can be compared with the experimental uncertainty @xmath65 , defined as @xmath66 ^ 2                           \\over \\sum_q [ s_e(\\vec{q})]^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath67 are the experimental uncertainties of the structure factors at the bragg points @xmath68 . using the experimental data of renaud @xcite",
    ", we found @xmath69 whereas our best fit had @xmath70 .",
    "comparison of the calculated and experimental structure factors , fig .",
    "[ dif_pat.eps ] shows good agreement of the intense peaks around the substrate bragg peaks .",
    "some discrepancy is observed for less intense peaks further away from the substrate bragg peaks . the biggest difference in the structure factors",
    "is found for @xmath71 .",
    "the reason is most probably in the simple substrate potential used , so one can not expect to find exactly the same structure as on a real sapphire surface .",
    "the simulations were done by energy minimization . in principle , however , the energy minimization is acceptable only for low temperatures , when the entropy is small , and one should minimize the free energy . it is expected that the structure observed in the experiment at room temperature has minimal free energy at the freezing temperature which is substantially higher than the room temperature . at the freezing temperature ,",
    "the contribution of the entropy is significant .",
    "this  together with the simplified overlayer - substrate potential  possibly explains why the more disordered structure with the best fit has higher energy than some other  more ordered  structures with worse fit .",
    "indeed , the energy difference between different structures , simulated with the same variational parameters , was of the order @xmath72 ev / atom ( if distributed uniformly among 314 atoms ) and is of the same order as the contribution of the entropy to the free energy at the freezing temperature .",
    "another mechanism which would lead to a metastable overlayer structure could be channeling , transport of al atoms directly into a strongly metastable state on the surface during the process of oxygen evaporation .",
    "however , it is very unlikely that the metastable potential minima would be so deep that diffusion at @xmath61000 k could nt bring the overlayer structure to an equilibrium .",
    "renaud et al . were not able to tell in their paper @xcite which al plane is higher .",
    "they did , however , distinguish between the more ordered and more disordered planes . on the basis of preliminary numerical relaxation they anticipated that the more disordered layer was the lower plane",
    ". our simulation does not support this distinction , we found both planes equally disordered .",
    "if the simulations were done with 314 al atoms , 158 atoms were found in the lower layer , which is much flatter than the upper layer . in the hexagonal domains ,",
    "the al atoms are well ordered in both planes like in metallic al(111 ) . in the domain walls ,",
    "the al atoms are strongly disordered . in the simulation , the disorder",
    "is manifested also in such a way that equivalent atoms in different reconstructed unit cells had different positions , the translational symmetry of the reconstructed unit cell was broken .      in our `` best fit '' structure , fig .",
    "[ rec_struc ] , the disordered regions ( domain walls ) were less pronounced than in the structure proposed by renaud et al .",
    "our structure has a smoother transition between the domains , one could say that our domain walls are broader .",
    "it is not clear to which extent this difference is the consequence of approximate description of the substrate potential .    with the substrate potential described by eq .",
    "( [ usub ] ) , one can not study the process of oxygen evaporation , we can not say whether two overlayers of al are stable or only a transient state and more al layers are formed upon further heating . a stabilizing mechanism , discussed in detail by chen et al .",
    "@xcite , is based on the attraction between two surfaces across a thin metal , similar to the casimir effect .",
    "this attraction is described by the hamaker constant .",
    "we estimated the hamaker constant of al metal between sapphire insulator and vacuum , @xmath77 ev .",
    "the corresponding energy gain is of the order @xmath78 ev/(al atom ) .",
    "we conclude that this mechanism of attraction between the two adjacent interfaces is too weak to stop the overlayer growth at two monolayers .",
    "in fact , the experimentalists observe that further heating in uhv brings more al atoms to the surface @xcite , the two - layer @xmath0 reconstructed structure is thus not an equilibrium state of sapphire at 1350 c. thus , in uhv , more al atoms build next monolayers whereas heating under oxygen atmosphere oxidizes and deconstructs the surface .",
    "the fact that a metallic type potential , eq .",
    "( [ alpot ] ) , leads to a good model of this reconstructed sapphire surface is consistent with the metallic character of its al overlayer .",
    "the minor discrepancy in some diffraction peaks is probably due to the oversimplified substrate potential which can not lead to the exact details of the reconstruction .",
    "but the good overall agreement of the diffraction patterns shows that we have used reasonable interatomic interaction ingredients to simulate this reconstruction ."
