    "( 2010 , here after m2010 ) present a detail study of an outburst of the x - ray binary ( xrb ) aquila  x-1 ( aql  x-1 ) .",
    "aql  x-1 is a binary system of a k7v star and a neutron star ( ns ) that experiences repeated outbursts . m2010",
    "discuss the outburst properties in the context of the transition from the hard state to the soft state and back , and plot the evolution of aql  x-1 on the hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) commonly used for outbursts of accreting black hole ( bh ) .     during the canonical hard state of a bh xrb outburst",
    ", a steady optically thick compact jet is expected . during the hard to soft state transition",
    "( and sometimes back the other way ) a major radio flare , brighter than the compact jet , occurs , and optically thin jet ejecta are often observed or inferred to be launched when the `` jet line '' is crossed ( e.g. , fender et al . 2009 ) .",
    "it is still not known whether the compact jet exist during the soft state .",
    "m2010 notice two significant differences between the outburst of aql  x-1 and outbursts of bhs .",
    "these are the flat radio spectrum between 5 and 8  ghz , and the absence of bright , optically thin , relativistically moving knots .",
    "a major radio outburst is observed to occur during the hard - soft transition in the outburst of aql  x-1 .",
    "however , during this transition , its spectrum is flat and no jet ejecta are seen .",
    "g2010 argue that during this transition only the compact jet is being observed .",
    "the presence of a compact jet in this transition may or may not be consistent with bh xrbs . it is the lack of transient , optically thin jet emission in this transition that is different from other bh xrb outbursts .    in light of these differences and some similarity with solar flares ,",
    "i speculate on an alternative interpretation to the radio and soft x - ray emissions ( but not to the hard x - ray emission preceding these two ) based on magnetic flares .",
    "the alternative interpretation of magnetic activity was discussed for an accreting white dwarf by soker & vrtilek ( 2009 ) .",
    "soker & vrtilek ( 2009 ) suggested that the radio emission from an outburst of the dwarf nova ss cyg reported by krding et al .",
    "( 2008 ) originated from magnetic activity that formed a corona similar to coronae found in magnetically active stars , rather than from jets .",
    "soker & vrtilek ( 2009 ) based their claim on the results of laor & behar ( 2008 ; hereafter lb2008 ) , who found that when the ratio between radio and x - ray fluxes of accretion disks in radio - quiet quasars is as in active stars , @xmath0 , then most of the radio emission might come from coronae . in lb2008 ,",
    "the radio luminosity is @xmath1 , usually at around 6 cm , while @xmath2 is the integrated x - ray luminosity in the range @xmath3 .",
    "jets might still occur . if the magnetic activity in erupting accreting disks is similar to that in active stars , then mass ejection , is expected .",
    "the presence of coronae above accretion disks ( e.g. , galeev et al .",
    "1979 ; done & osborne 1997 ; wheatley & mauche 2005 ) , and the connection between coronae and jets ( e.g. , fender et al . 1999 ; markoff et al . 2005 ; rodriguez & prat 2008 ) has already been proposed . however , the results of ishida et al .",
    "( 2009 ; also lb2008 ) put the presence of coronae in accretion disks on a solid ground , and further suggest that magnetic activity similar to that in active stars occur in these coronae .",
    "the speculative interpretation in the present letter ( section [ sec : flare ] ) is based on three properties of the november 2009 outburst of aql  x-1 ( m2010 ) .",
    "i emphasize that i do not propose an alternative explanation to the hard ( @xmath4 ) x - ray peak , and in any case postpone its detail study for a future paper . in x - ray transients the hard x - ray peak",
    "can generally be accounted for by a disk instability as studied by dubus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in the present case",
    ", the hard x - ray peak has a triangular shape ( see definition in chen et al .",
    "1997 ) for @xmath5d .",
    "the radio peak appears during the decay phase of the hard x - ray emission .",
    "the soft ( rxte asm ; @xmath6 ) x - ray emission appears with the hard x - ray emission , but its large and rapid rise starts only after the radio peak ( see below ) .",
    "the two peaks , one in the hard x - ray followed by one in the soft x - ray , can be seen for another flare of aql  x-1 in yu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , but they do not have radio observations .",
    "the two x - ray peaks do not resemble at all the secondary peaks discussed for x - ray novae by chen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and must be explained by a different process . among xrb systems",
    "the double peak structure of the outburst is common , like xte j1859 + 226 ( brocksopp et al .",
    "2002 ) in which the radio peak occurs at the start of the extended soft x - ray peak ; the hard x - ray peak occurs before the peaks of the radio and of the soft x - ray emissions ( brocksopp et al .",
    "such a structure is seen in solar flares as well . in the magnetic flare model the hard x - ray peak",
    "is related to the event that rapidly amplifies the magnetic field .",
    "this field later powers the radio and soft x - ray emissions .",
    "the appearance of the hard x - ray and soft x - ray peaks one after the other is quite similar to that seen in bh xrb systems , but it is not at all similar to the delay in rise to maximum between the optical and extreme uv and x - ray emissions in dwarf novae ( mauche et al . 2001 ; wheatley et al .",
    "2003 ) . in aql",
    "the two peaks are separated , while in dwarf novae their behavior with time is more or less similar , with a relatively short delay .",
    "the disk instability can account for the delay in dwarf novae ( schreiber et al .",
    "2003 ) , but here a different explanation is required .",
    "many solar flares , as well as of similar stars such as uv ceti ( gdel et al . 1996 ) , show the neupert effect ( neupert 1968 ) .",
    "this effect is a behavior where the integration of the radio flux ( and in many cases the non - thermal hard x - ray emission ) is proportional to the x - ray flux at rise . in some cases ,",
    "the radio peak comes at the beginning of the x - ray rise .    in figure",
    "[ fig : flare ] , i compare the behavior of one specific solar flare as compiled by gdel et al .",
    "( 1996 ; more detail in cliver et al .",

    "the solar flare is a gradual hard x - ray burst ( ghb ) of april 26 , 1981 ( cliver et al .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    i note the following similarities between the bursts in these two vastly different systems :    1 .   the general shape of the radio ( 3.6  cm-6  cm ) and the soft ( @xmath6 ) x - ray emissions is similar , with a ratio of @xmath10 in time scale between the two systems .",
    "the beginning of the soft x - ray emission appears before the radio .",
    "part of this early rise might be a contribution from the hard x - ray component .",
    "however , from the different behavior of the two components , some of the early rise is part of the soft x - ray component itself .",
    "however , the steep rise in x - ray flux comes only after the radio peak .",
    "the rise to maximum in radio flux is slightly faster than the decline .",
    "5 .   in the 1981 april 26 solar ghb",
    "there is a hard x - ray peak preceding the radio peak ( fig . 1 in cliver et al .",
    "1986 ; fig . 7 in dennis & zarro 1993 ) .",
    "this is similar to the hard x - ray peak preceding the radio peak in aql  x-1 .",
    "however , i do not claim the same explanation for the hard x - ray peaks in the two systems .",
    "i only claim that the hard x - ray emission is connected to the process that powers the radio and soft x - ray peaks that follow .",
    "there is a weaker second radio peak in the light curve of aql  x-1 .",
    "the popular accretion disc - radio jet paradigm ( the spectral state transition paradigm ) predicts reflaring in radio as the source hardens .",
    "the magnetic flare interpretation proposed here , on the other hand , requires the presence of a second flare .",
    "indeed , the small radio peak precedes a major x - ray flare that has its x - ray peak 24 days after the second radio peak ( swift / bat hard x - ray transient monitor home - page ) .",
    "it is possible that a larger radio peak was presence closer to the second x - ray peak , but no radio data exit .",
    "consecutive flares are seen in stars .",
    "the january 7 1995 flare c of uv ceti occurred during the decline of flare b ( gdel et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the radio peak of flare c was stronger than that in flare b , but its x - ray emission was much weaker .",
    "lb2008 present a correlation between the radio and soft x - ray luminosities @xmath11 , that holds over 20 orders of magnitude , excluding some systems , e.g. , the sun , galactic bh xrbs , and radio loud quasars . in some cases",
    "this ratio is as low as @xmath12 , in particular in weak solar flares ( micro - flares ; benz & gdel 1994 ) and in galactic bh xrbs .",
    "lb2008 raised the possibility that the lower @xmath7 in bh xrbs is due to the higher temperature of their disk .",
    "if this is indeed the case , it strengthens the connection between the flaring systems proposed here .    in the november 2009 outburst of aql",
    "x-1 this ratio was @xmath13 . at the radio peak",
    "the x - ray luminosity was lower , and this ratio was @xmath14 .",
    "this is similar to weak solar flares . in the solar flare from april 26 , 1981",
    "this ratio is @xmath15 ( the total energy in the radio is six orders of magnitude below that in the x - ray ) .",
    "we note that the ratio in solar flares is mainly obtained with the soft x - ray flux @xmath16 ( e.g. , gdel et al . 1996 ) .",
    "taking the @xmath17 range for the solar flare , will reduce the @xmath7 ratio only by a factor of 2 .",
    "the fluxes for aql x-1 is taken for the @xmath18 band ( m2010 ) , which is somewhat narrower than the band used by lb2008 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "for the spectra of these sources this does not make a significant difference , as emission peaks around a few kev .    in accretion onto compact objects",
    "some x - ray emission comes from shocked gas , a process that does not exist in the sun . over all",
    ", the ratio @xmath19 in the november 2009 outburst of aql  x-1 falls within the range of weak solar flares and bh xrbs too .",
    "m2010 attribute the flat radio spectrum to an optically thick compact jet .",
    "however , in bh xrb outbursts , the radio emission after a major radio flare is dominated by optically thin jet ejecta , and there is currently no evidence that the compact jet remains on . for the november 2009 outburst m2010",
    "find ( near 8  ghz ) @xmath20 .",
    "the weighted vla data yields @xmath21 . both measurements would need to be off by 3 sigma to be consistent with @xmath22 ( as in optically thin jet ejecta ) . according to m2010 , this is not compatible with internal shocks in jets .",
    "it thus seems that a magnetic flare can account for this radio spectrum .",
    "kundu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , for example , find for the magnetic looptop in a solar flare @xmath23 near 8  ghz .    although xrb systems might show different behaviors ( e.g. , agrawal & misra 2009 ) , in general xrb emission can be well fitted by a combination of a soft component composed of a multi - color disc blackbody and a hard component of a power - law or comptonized single temperature ( e.g. , maitra & bailyn 2004;gou et al 2009 ) .",
    "stellar ( including solar ) flares can be fitted by emission from thin plasma ( coronal emission ) , e.g. , battaglia et al .",
    "the x - ray spectra of stellar flares , therefore , are not similar to those of xrb systems .",
    "but they do not need to be identical in the proposed model .",
    "lb2008 note the different x - ray spectra of agn and stellar flares .",
    "they argue that the cooling mechanism of the hot gas formed by the magnetic activity is different .",
    "while in stellar flares the cooling is by thermal emission from optically thin plasma , in agn the cooling is comptonization of the optical - uv disk continuum by hot thermal gas ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "still , lb2008 argue , in both types of systems the hot plasma is formed by magnetic activity .    as for xrb systems discussed here ,",
    "it is possible that the hot gas is cooling by heating the disk .",
    "for example , the hot electrons formed in the magnetic reconnection process stream down along magnetic field lines anchored to the disk .",
    "this will increase the black body emission from the disk .",
    "in addition , some contribution from optically thin plasma ( as in stellar flares ) is expected .",
    "these processes are the subject of a future paper . in particular two processes",
    "will be studied : the formation of the very hot gas by magnetic activity in the flaring region , and heat conduction from that region to the disk .",
    "after all , this chain of event is what is behind the neupert effect : hot electrons heat ( and evaporate ) the chromosphere .",
    "this future study will have to examine where the heat conduction in the environment of accretion disks can indeed heat the disk to increase its blackbody radiation .",
    "the three properties discussed in section [ sec : flare ] hint that the behavior of the soft x - ray and radio emissions in the november 2009 outburst of the xrb aql  x-1 , were similar to gradual hard x - ray bursts ( ghbs ) in the sun and similar stars , e.g. , uv ceti ( gdel et al .",
    "the strongest of these properties is the similar light curve in hard x - ray , soft x - ray , and radio emissions .",
    "the similarity in the radio and soft x - ray light curves is shown in figure [ fig : flare ] .",
    "the hard x - ray peak in aql x-1 can be attributed to the disk instability ( dubus et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it is the behavior of the soft x - ray and radio emissions that i try to explain in this letter .",
    "the typical size of the soft x - ray loop of solar ghbs is @xmath25 ( see fig . 10 in cliver et al .",
    "if we use a very simple scaling from the solar flare , the duration of the aql  x-1 , which is @xmath26 times as long as a solar flare , implies a reconnection size that is @xmath26 times as large , or @xmath27 .",
    "interestingly , the orbital separation in aql  x-1 is @xmath28 ; for an orbital period of 19  h ( chevalier & ilovaisky 1991 ) and a total mass of @xmath29 ( welsh et al . 2000 ) .",
    "namely , the magnetic field reconnection event occurs over a size about equal to the binary separation , which is just a little larger than the disk size .",
    "i propose that a disk instability triggered the formation of an extended corona around the accretion disk , on a size about equal to the binary separation .",
    "this is the event seen in the hard x - ray of aql  x-1 by m2010 that preceded both the radio and soft x - ray fluxes .",
    "then , a major magnetic flaring ( reconnection and other means of magnetic energy release ) occurred . such a magnetic flare can accelerate gas and lead to the formation of a jet .",
    "the total energy emitted in the soft x - ray in the flare is @xmath30 . taking the total volume occupied by the reconnecting magnetic fields to be @xmath31 , the required average magnetic field intensity is @xmath32  g. this is not unreasonable .",
    "active stars with a similar size of @xmath33 have magnetic fields of @xmath34  g. the magnetic field of the ap star hd  137509 , for example , reaches values of @xmath35 g ( mathys 1995 ) .",
    "the magnetic field comes from a disk dynamo , which should be a major issue to be studied in the future .",
    "encouraging are also some similarities of the properties mentioned in this paper to strong and long x - ray flares of young stars characterized by having active or inactive accretion disks around them",
    ". favata et al .",
    "( 2005 ) observed the orion nebula cluster with _",
    "chandra _ , and analyzed flares from young stars with such disks around them .",
    "some flares last for up to 5 days .",
    "the structure favata et al .",
    "( 2005 ) infer is of large and long , @xmath36 , magnetic structures",
    ". a large and long magnetic loop can be behind the outburst of aql  x-1 in the proposed model .",
    "the total energy in the strong flares studied by favata et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is @xmath37 .",
    "this is @xmath38 times that in the flare of aql  x-1 .",
    "the six ( out of 32 ) brightest flares have luminosities in the range of @xmath39 , or @xmath40 times that of the outburst of aql  x-1 .",
    "this ratio is of the same order of magnitude as the ratio of the gravitational potential wells in the two types of objects    some points must be clarified before the speculative interpretation suggested here can gain more credibility .",
    "( 1 ) it should be shown that a reconnection event ( or several events ) can account for the high luminosity in the x - ray ( up to @xmath41 ) .",
    "( 2 ) there is a need to compare not only the observed properties , but also the physical processes .",
    "namely , lots of work has been done on solar flares and ghbs .",
    "it will have to be shown that similar processes can take place in an extended coronae of xrbs .",
    "the proposed magnetic flare explanation is a paradigm shift from the common interpretation of outburst in xrbs .",
    "this paradigm shift can be traced back to lb2008 who pointed out the similar radio to x - ray fluxes ratio in a variety of astronomical objects , including stellar flares and accreting super massive bhs in active galactic nuclei .",
    "i therefore suggest that the proposed magnetic flaring model holds for bh xrbs as well ( see also , e.g. , rodriguez & prat 2008 )",
    ". basically , where we expect strong dynamo to operate , we should expect strong magnetic flares .",
    "accretion disks have very strong shear compared with stars , and they must have some kind of turbulence to supply the viscosity .",
    "as such , a strong dynamo exists in accretion disks .",
    "the large flares are expected to occur when the magnetic field energy is further amplified",
    ". such can be the case when the disk becomes unstable , and erupt .",
    "the outflowing gas stretches magnetic field lines and substantially amplifies the field . after this triggering eruption ,",
    "the field lines reconnect and release the huge amount of magnetic energy .",
    "however , in some cases disk outbursts might not result in substantial magnetic field amplification , and no large magnetic flare will occur .    if the similarity presented in this paper holds , it adds to previous suggestions on similarity between coronae in active stars and accretion disks ( lb2008 ) , and similarity in the processes of mass ejection by solar flares and the launching of jets from accretion disks powered by magnetic fields reconnection ( de gouveia dal pino & lazarian 2005 ; de gouveia dal pino et al .",
