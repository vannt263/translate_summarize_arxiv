    "it is well known that the equilibrium momentum distribution of free noninteracting fermions is described by the fermi - dirac distribution function . when interactions are turned on , the momentum distribution is changed due to these interactions .",

    "the situation becomes much more complicated if the interaction between fermions can not be neglected .",
    "then , numerical methods usually need to be applied , especially when the system is in a trap . on the other hand ,",
    "the momentum distribution function is a quantity that can be directly accessed in experiments with ultracold atomic gases and therefore it is of a particular importance in trying to make contact between theory and experiment .",

    "we answer these questions here .    in section",

    "a mixture of light and heavy fermionic atoms in a harmonic trap ( each in one and only one hyperfine atomic state and hence acting like a spinless fermion ) , under the assumption that the quantum - mechanical effects of the hopping of the heavy atoms can be neglected , is described by the falicov  kimball hamiltonian @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an operator that creates a light fermionic atom at site @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the on  site interspecies interaction potential .",

    "@xmath8 is the trap for the heavy atoms and @xmath9 is its respective chemical potential .",
    "the symbol @xmath10 or 1 is the number operator of the heavy particles , which can be treated as a classical variable since the heavy particles do not hop .",
    "the same hamiltonian can also describe fermi - bose mixtures , provided the bosonic atoms are the heavy ( localized ) ones and a strong repulsion between them prevents them from occupying one site by two bosons ( hard core bosons ) .",
    "this model can easily be extended to describe a system with soft - core bosons .",
    "in such a case @xmath11 and an additional term describing the boson - boson on - site interaction @xmath12 has to be added to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] )  @xcite . the trap potentials for the light ( @xmath6 ) and heavy ( @xmath13 )",

    "v^h_i=\\frac{j}{\\left(r^h\\right)^2}\\left(x_i^2+y_i^2\\right ) \\label{trap}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the position of site @xmath4 ( @xmath16 is the lattice constant ) .",
    "the steepness of the potential confining the light atoms varies from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , whereas it is fixed for the heavy atoms with @xmath19 . the chemical potentials @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath9 have been introduced in order to control the number of the light and heavy atoms , respectively .",
    "the model is solved by means of a variation of the monte carlo ( mc ) method .",
    "the method is based on the classical metropolis algorithm modified in such a way that systems with both quantum and classical degrees of freedom can be simulated @xcite . in each mc step , a new configuration of the heavy atoms is generated .",
    "then , the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) is numerically diagonalized to yield all the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the light atoms for the trial configuration of the heavy atoms . the new configuration of the heavy atoms is accepted according to the same rules as in the metropolis algorithm , but with the free energy of the light atoms used for comparing energies instead of the internal energy .",
    "the results are then averaged over all the configurations generated during the entire mc run .",
    "real - space configurations of the atoms for different model parameters ( interaction , shape of the trapping potential ) at different temperatures have been studied in ref . .",
    "in the present paper we use a similar method to investigate the momentum distribution and bragg scattering spectra . since diagonalization of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) for a given configuration of the heavy atoms gives all the eigenstates of the light atoms , it allows one to also calculate the momentum distribution of the light atoms . under the assumption that the optical lattice potential is deep enough that we can restrict to a single - band model , then the field operator of these atoms @xmath20 ( expanded in terms of the bloch wavefunctions for the lowest band )",
    "is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the bloch wavefunction .",
    "expanding the bloch wavefunction in terms of the wannier wavefunctions of the lowest band @xmath24 which are localized about lattice site @xmath25 yields @xmath26 .",

    "then , the free space momentum distribution can be calculated as @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fourier transform of the wannier function .",
    "hence the momentum distribution can be approximated by @xmath29 in the single - band limit , with @xmath30 the number of lattice sites .    here , the quantum mechanical expectation value @xmath31 is calculated for a given configuration of the heavy atoms and therefore @xmath32 has to be averaged over the configurations .",
    "we ignore dynamic interactions between heavy and light atoms due to scattering in the course of the expansion in the time - of - flight experiments .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation since the density of the clouds is very small once the trap and the optical lattice potentials are dropped .",
    "since those potentials are dropped over a finite period of time , there can be some effects as the potentials are lowered , but these tend to be smaller in these systems because the repulsive interspecies interaction keeps the light and heavy particles away from each other in their initial distributions on the lattice prior to the time - of - flight experiment .",
    "since in our approximation the heavy atoms are localized , we are interested in the momentum distribution of only the light ones . the heavy atoms , however , may display some kind of density - wave ordering , which has been demonstrated in ref . .",
    "in particular , for some regimes of parameters they form a checkerboard pattern where the heavy atoms occupy only , _ e.g. _ , black squares . in another regime ,",
    "superpositions of vertical and horizontal stripes or phase separation , with the heavy and light atoms occupying different regions of space have been observed .",
    "of course , for any nonvanishing interaction between both species of atoms the distribution of the light atoms is up to some degree correlated with the distribution of the heavy ones . as a result ,",
    "also the light atoms are ordered , but unless the interaction is strong enough , the magnitude of the density - wave order is much smaller .",
    "this follows from the fact that the light atoms , in contrast to the heavy ones , gain kinetic energy while delocalized .",
    "the ordering of the heavy atoms can be analyzed by use of scattering of light ( bragg scattering , see _",
    "e.g. _ , ref . ) .",
    "this kind of experiment is an equivalent to neutron or x - ray diffraction for the solid state .",
    "however , due to the difference of lattice constants between solid state crystals and optical lattices , the required wavelength corresponds to that of visible light .",
    "the observation of well - defined bragg peaks has been used to confirm a crystalline structure formed by atoms in an optical lattice @xcite . since",
    "this method allows one to determine the distance between atoms forming the crystalline structure , it can be applied in order to detect the checkerboard pattern as well . in the case of strong repulsive interaction between the light and heavy atoms , checkerboard squares of different color",
    "are occupied by different kinds of atoms and the problem is similar to the detection of antiferromagnetic ( af ) order .",
    "it has recently been proposed to use bragg diffraction of light to detect such an order @xcite in a hubbard system . in the case of af order , the spin ",
    "dependent scattering is achieved by using the probe light frequency near atomic resonance , where the interaction between light and atoms is neither purely diffractive nor purely absorptive . in a similar way",
    "the probe light can be tuned to be scattered in a different way by the light and heavy atoms . as a result",
    ", we can expect a @xmath33 peak in the case of a two - dimensional checkerboard pattern with the light scattered by the heavy atoms .",
    "moreover , the intensity of this peak can give information about the fraction of the system occupied by ordered atoms .",
    "this method can also be used to detect other types of correlations . if the `` labyrinthine '' patterns obtained in monte carlo simulations @xcite are superpositions or mixtures of horizontal and vertical stripes , the bragg scattering in this case should reveal @xmath34 and @xmath35 peaks .",
    "the bragg spectra integrated over the frequency gives the static structure factor @xmath36 , a key quantity that can be expressed as @xmath37 in a practical realization we get a new configuration @xmath38 in each mc step and in each step @xmath36 is calculated .",
    "then , @xmath36 is averaged over the entire mc run .",
    "simulations have been carried out on a @xmath39 square lattice with 625 heavy and 625 light atoms .",
    "in contrast to solid state simulations , there is no translational symmetry in the real system and therefore we use hard - wall boundary conditions at the edges . for steep harmonic trap potentials ( and at low @xmath40 ) most of the atoms are in the center of the system , however , if the potentials are shallow the results may be affected by the finite size of the cluster .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the real - space distributions of the light and heavy atoms for different shapes of the trap for the light atoms [ see eq .",
    "( [ trap ] ) for the trap potential parametrization ] .",
    "the trapping potential for the heavy atoms is kept at @xmath19 for all simulations .    from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] one can see that if the light atoms trap potential is sufficiently steep and the repulsion between the two species of atoms is relatively strong ( @xmath41 ) , the heavy atoms are pushed out from the center of the trap .",
    "this is an intuitive result .",
    "however , when the trap potential for the light atoms becomes shallower they start to spread and occupy the periphery of the cluster even before the trap curvatures are set to be equal . for identical potentials ,",
    "the heavy atoms are concentrated in the central part of the trap , surrounded by the light atoms .",
    "in such a configuration the light atoms can gain kinetic energy at the expense of the potential energy in the harmonic trap .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the momentum distribution of the light atoms for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "since the strong repulsion leads to phase separation , at least in the limiting cases , the light atoms are able to move freely within the region not occupied by the heavy atoms .",
    "nevertheless , one can notice that there is no sign of the fermi surface in the momentum distribution , which results from the inhomogeneity of the system .",

    "independent of the strength of the interaction , the inhomogeneity destroys any signs of the fermi edge in the momentum distribution .",
    "when the trap becomes shallower , behavior that looks like a fermi edge appears , but this is due to the box boundary conditions at the edge of the lattice .",
    "even though there is no explicit signal in the momentum distribution function which shows the presence of different kinds of density wave ordering , the momentum distribution function does have a strong dependence on the appearance of phase separation , as can be seen in the different distribution functions in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "for example , it is known that in a homogeneous lattice , the momentum distribution function must decrease below the noninteracting value for small momentum and increase above the noninteracting value for large momentum  @xcite when the system phase separates at low temperature .",
    "this behavior is clearly seen in all of the data , and most likely is arising from different forms of quantum confinement effects associated with the phase separation .",
    "unfortunately , it is not easy to disentangle this phase separation effect from the effect of the trap , which has a similar effect on the momentum distribution function , except in the case where the heavy particles surround the light ones and confine them with a sharp boundary . in that case",

    "[ r12_9]b is fourfold split .",
    "this results from an imperfection of the checkerboard ordering of the heavy atoms .",
    "this can be explained from an analysis of the lda : the effective chemical potential varies continuously when the distance from the center of the trap increases .",
    "hence one expects that the density of atoms ( both light and heavy ) should also vary in a continuous way .",

    "in this paper , we have examined two simple experimental probes that can reveal information about ordered density wave phases in mixtures of light and heavy fermionic atoms ( or equivalently light fermionic and heavy `` hard core '' bosonic atoms ) on an optical lattice .",
    "namely , we examined the momentum distribution function , which comes from a time - of - flight expansion experiment and the bragg scattering signal that would come from scattered optical light that scatters off of the density wave pattern",
    ".    the momentum distribution function does not provide significant information about various ordered density wave phases , but it does provide some intuition about phase separated states . in particular , as the distribution flattens and broadens , one has an indication of phase separation setting in .",
    "furthermore , if the heavy atoms surround the lights and confine the light atoms with essentially a hard wall boundary condition , then the momentum distribution function develops a sharp dimple at low momentum which does provide a characteristic shape signalling that form of phase separation .",
    "bragg scattering is much more effective at showing the presence of ordered density wave phases , as new bragg reflection `` spots '' appear at appropriate ordering vectors for the different types of order present in the sample .",
    "the weight underneath these peaks is proportional to the strength of the ordering , and to the volume of regions which are ordered , and hence they can be used for accurate low - temperature thermometry of these systems . as @xmath40 is lowered , the weight in the peaks grows and can be calibrated via numerical calculations to produce an appropriate temperature of the system .    one caveat of this work",
    ", however , is that one must cool the mixture down to a low enough temperature that the ordering appears in the system .",
    "typically , this requires a temperature at least as low as about 1/40th of the bandwidth , and often substantially lower .",
    "this is an aggressively low temperature with current cooling technology , but hopefully can be reached as it becomes easier to manipulate entropy distributions within trapped atomic systems .",
    "finally , we also should note that direct _ in situ _ imaging via apparatus like the quantum gas microscope would provide even more convincing pictures of the ordered phases , and the fluctuations about that order , than the above proposed methods , but we are not aware of any plans to examine these kinds of mixtures with such machines in the near term .",

    "<S> the momentum distribution is one of the most important quantities which provides information about interactions in many - body systems . at the same time it is a quantity that can easily be accessed in experiments on ultracold atoms . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider mixtures of light and heavy fermionic atoms in an optical lattice described effectively by the falicov - kimball model . using a monte carlo method , we study how different ordered density - wave phases can be detected by measurement of the momentum distribution of the light atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that ordered phases can be seen in bragg scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the main factor that determines the momentum distribution of the light atoms is the trap confinement . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the pattern formed by the heavy atoms seen in the bragg scattering experiments is very sensitive to the temperature and possibly can be used in low - temperature thermometry . </S>"
