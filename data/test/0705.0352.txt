    "copes with this problem by arguing that the stress responsible for angular momentum transport , due to turbulence and magnetic fields , is proportional to the local pressure , i.e. , @xmath0 . here , @xmath1 is a dimensionless constant of the order of , but smaller than , unity and @xmath2 characterizes the local shear @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that the standard parametrization leads to a disk model in which the energy generation rate is determined mostly by energy balance and depends weakly on the adopted prescription @xcite , almost every aspect of the disk structure depends explicitly on this assumption  @xcite . therefore calculating the value of @xmath1 , or more generally , testing whether the assumed relationship between stress and pressure is adequate , is of fundamental importance .",
    "these questions , however , lie outside the scope of the standard theory , making necessary the identification of a specific physical mechanism for angular momentum transport .    over the last decade ,",
    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; balbus & hawley 1991 ; 1998 ) has emerged as the most promising candidate to enable angular momentum transport in astrophysical disks .",
    "the development of three - dimensional mhd numerical codes has led to a detailed study and characterization of angular momentum transport in turbulent magnetized disks .",
    "this has motivated numerical estimations of the @xmath1 parameter and , more generally , the search for saturation predictors to describe the turbulent state ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has long been recognized that the @xmath1 parameter is not a constant .",
    "it is known to depend , among other things , on the strength and geometry of the magnetic field and , perhaps more uncomfortably , on the size of the simulation domain and the resolution . in spite of this , it has not been possible to disentangle numerical from physical dependencies in a clear way ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    the search for a mechanism for the saturation of the mri - driven turbulence has been a long - sought for goal since the appreciation of the relevance of the mri to astrophysical disks . by necessity , a key piece of this puzzle consists of understanding the role that the various factors , both physical and numerical , play in the saturated state . in this",
    ", we provide an expression that describes the transport of angular momentum in shearing mhd boxes , based on a series of local numerical simulations carried out by @xcite . in particular , we are able to disentangle how the characteristics of the mhd flow depend on the various physical ( pressure , magnetic field , etc . ) and numerical ( box size and resolution ) factors .",
    "numerical studies addressing the local dynamics of three - dimensional , differentially rotating , turbulent magnetized flows are often carried out in the shearing box approximation .",
    "this consists of a first order expansion in the variable @xmath3 of all the quantities characterizing the flow at the fiducial radius @xmath4 .",
    "the goal of this approach is to retain the most relevant physics governing the dynamics of the mhd fluid in a locally - cartesian coordinate system co - orbiting and corotating with the background flow with local velocity @xmath5 .    in the shearing box framework",
    ", all the physical variables are usually normalized using the initial density , @xmath6 , and the angular velocity , @xmath7 . for a more detailed discussion concerning the physical approximations and numerical implementations involved in the shearing box approach see @xcite . in an unstratified shearing box",
    "there are three possible scales of length relevant to the vertical direction : _",
    "( i ) _ the first scale is the size of the box @xmath8 . _",
    "( ii ) _ the second scale is the wavelength corresponding to the most unstable mri mode , i.e. , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the average alfvn velocity associated with the vertical component of the magnetic field , @xmath11 , and we have assumed a keplerian shear profile ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) . _ ( iii ) _ the last scale is associated with the sound speed : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the ratio of specific heats and @xmath15 is the speed of sound . in a stratified disk , @xmath16 is the pressure scale - height and , for simplicity , we will refer to it as such hereafter , even though the particular simulations we will be discussing are not stratified .",
    "most systematic studies carried out to characterize the turbulent state driven by the mri consider non - radiative flows in which the internal energy grows in time due to magnetic dissipation .",
    "furthermore , most of the initial efforts to characterize the saturated state of the mri employed numerical schemes that evolved the internal energy , as opposed to the total energy . in these cases",
    "the reported values of @xmath1 , as well as the expressions for different predictor functions , where obtained considering the initial pressure @xmath17 . in such simulations , however , gas pressure increases linearly with time and this effect must be considered in order to understand its effects on the stresses responsible for angular momentum transport .",
    "@xcite , carried out a series of numerical simulations in order to investigate the effects of the evolving pressure on the turbulent state .",
    "they employed an algorithm that solves the energy equation in terms of the total energy , which allowed them to keep better track of the energy budget of the flow . by considering the vertical extent of the box @xmath8 as the unit of length",

    "their choice of initial conditions spans six orders of magnitude in the initial pressure @xmath17 and two orders of magnitude in the alfvn speed .",

    "this scaling allows us to describe all the simulations on the same footing while leading to small residuals in the best fit amplitudes ( see fig .",

    "the overall dependence of the saturation level on the ratio @xmath20 ( _ solid line _ ) is given by the saturation predictor  ( [ eq : maxwell_predictor ] ) .",
    "numerical simulations for which @xmath48 are stable to the mri ( _ shaded region _ ) . ]    the vertical _ dotted lines _ in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] represent the values at which the most unstable mri wavelength equals the size of the box and the grid size , respectively , i.e. , @xmath49 and @xmath46 . note that numerical simulations for which @xmath48 are stable to the mri ( _ shaded region _ ) .",
    "the saturation of the simulations for which @xmath50 is linearly proportional to @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath51 note that @xcite concluded that @xmath52 .",
    "this steeper dependence does indeed provide a good description of the simulations with @xmath53 .",
    "however , a linear dependence on @xmath18 leads to a better overall description of all the simulations with @xmath50 , i.e. , including those with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "there is a clear departure from the linear dependence of the saturated stress on @xmath18 for the simulations for which @xmath56 .",
    "all of these runs saturate at the same value of @xmath57 regardless of the value of the magnetic flux through the vertical boundary .",
    "the fact that this minimum value of the stresses at saturation ( lower _ dashed line _ in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) is equal to 1/32 of the maximum possible value , corresponding to @xmath58 ( upper _ dashed line _ in the same figure ) , strongly suggests that this floor is entirely set by the grid size . extrapolating this behavior to lower values of the grid scale",
    "suggests that this minimum saturation level is itself linearly proportional to the size of the grid .",
    "this is consistent with the results found in @xcite ; see in particular their figure 8 , where the final plasma @xmath59 s for simulations with zero net magnetic flux and uniform vertical magnetic fields is shown .",
    "the ratio of the final plasma @xmath59 for the simulation with highest uniform field to the average final plasma @xmath59 corresponding to the zero net magnetic flux runs is indeed close to @xmath60 .",
    "the overall dependence of the saturation level on the ratio @xmath20 , i.e. , the _ solid line _ in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] , is described by the function @xmath61 this saturation predictor is consistent , in the intermediate regime , with the one obtained by @xcite that we also used in an earlier work ( pessah et al .",
    "indeed , substituting in this expression @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and considering that the magnetic stress is roughly half of the magnetic energy in the fluctuations , @xmath64 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , leads to @xmath65 which is identical to equation ( 18 ) of  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath66 scaling in the saturation predictor  ( [ eq : maxwell_predictor ] ) is reminiscent of the kolmogorov spectrum of turbulence .",
    "the prominent role of @xmath67 in this expression is another indication that the mri continues to pump the turbulence , even in the non - linear state ( see also pessah et al .  2006a , 2006b ) .",
    "the dependence of the stress on the vertical size of the box , @xmath8 , must be an artifact of the periodic boundary conditions , which do not allow for any turbulent energy to escape the domain of solution .",
    "the dependence on the resolution must be related to numerical dissipation at the grid scale , and might , therefore , change if a different mhd algorithm were used for the simulations .",
    "finally , the role of the `` scale - height '' , @xmath16 , is very difficult to understand , since the simulations are not stratified and this length scale is too large to be resolved . it may arise from a non - linear coupling between sound waves and mhd modes or it might simply be related to numerical dissipation through the dependence of the courant time step on sound speed",
    "in shearing - box simulations of keplerian flows , the maxwell and reynolds , @xmath68 , stresses follow a tight correlation ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) with @xmath69 . taking this into account",
    ", we can write for the total stress and the effective alpha viscosity @xmath70 where @xmath12 for a keplerian disk .",
    "this is a remarkable result .",
    "this expression accurately describes the overall dependence of the saturated state for 35 numerical simulations spanning six orders of magnitude in initial pressure , encompassing domains with zero and non - zero net magnetic flux , as well as adiabatic and isothermal equations of state .",
    "note that the very small values of the effective alpha viscosity reported in the past , which are unable to account for observations of astrophysical disks  @xcite , correspond to shearing box simulations with vertical extents that are small compared to the equivalent pressure scale - height .",
    "one would expect that a realistic value of the stress is achieved in simulations with @xmath71 .",
    "nevertheless , even having taken this into account , large values of the alpha viscosity can be achieved only for particular configurations .",
    "this has three important implications for accretion disk models in which the angular momentum transport is mediated by mri - driven turbulence .",
    "first , the saturated stresses in simulations with zero net magnetic flux are linearly proportional to the numerical resolution .",
    "this implies that if we were able to set the numerical resolution to the natural dissipation scale in the problem , which is many orders of magnitude smaller than the pressure scale height , the mri would be unable to sustain the necessary turbulent stresses in a keplerian shearing box , unless there were a significant magnetic flux through the vertical box boundaries .",
    "second , in order for mri - driven turbulence to account for the large values of the effective alpha viscosity inferred from observations ( @xmath72 ; see king et al .",
    "2007 ) , the vertical magnetic field must grow to a strength such that the most unstable mri - modes have wavelengths comparable to the disk scale - height , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "such vertical fields are only a small fraction , roughly a few hundredths , of the associated equipartition field and pose no significant problem to the energy budget of the accretion flow .",
    "indeed , the origin of such a small mean magnetic field perpendicular to the disk midplane need not be external to the disk",
    ". mri - driven fluctuations can easily give rise to magnetic fields of this order , perhaps through the combined effects of shearing , mri , and parker instability , as in the mechanism proposed by  @xcite .",
    "note that disk stratification is likely to play an important role in driving helical turbulence and thus in enabling the development of a global , large - scale magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "finally , in mri - driven turbulence , the turbulent magnetic energy is comparable to @xmath74 @xcite and , hence , will have to be also comparable to the thermal energy , if @xmath1 is of order unity .",
    "this implies that the vertical scale height of an accretion disk is set by both the magnetic and the thermal pressures , with important implication for the spectrum emerging from each disk annulus @xcite as well as for the viscous and thermal stability of the disk .    in closing",
    ", it is important to remark that the saturation predictor  ( [ eq : stress ] ) may be specific to shearing - box simulations with periodic boundary conditions and not necessarily applicable to the local saturation of stresses in stratified ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or global simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these cases , the physical mechanism that limits the growth of turbulent magnetic energy maybe related to magnetic buoyancy or to large meridional circulation . in both mechanisms ,",
    "magnetic energy is lost at large scales and , therefore , the dependence of the saturated stress on the numerical resolution and the sound speed may disappear . understanding the physical origin of the saturation predictor  ( [ eq : stress ] ) and comparing it to simulations of stratified shearing boxes will resolve these issues ."
