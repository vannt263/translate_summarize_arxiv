    "modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) was proposed by milgrom ( 1983a , b ) as an alternative to dark matter .",
    "mond posits that the effective gravitational force deviates from the newtonian force : at accelerations below a critical value , @xmath0 , the gravitational force is proportional to the square root of the newtonian force ; at higher accelerations , the force is newtonian . in principle , mond predicts the shape and amplitude of the observed rotation curves from the observed mass distribution , i.e. , gas and stars , with only the mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) of the stellar disk as adjustable parameter .",
    "the rotation curves of a large number of spiral galaxies have been considered in the context of mond .",
    "for example , begeman et al .  (",
    "1991 ) , sanders ( 1996 ) , sanders & verheijen ( 1998 ) , and sanders & noordermeer ( 2007 ) demonstrated that for the spiral galaxies the observed rotation curves were , in most cases , predicted in detail , using the mond prescription , from the observed light and gas distributions .",
    "moreover , the m / ls derived from these fits are generally astrophysically plausible and consistent with stellar population synthesis models . in a handful of these galaxies",
    "the rotation curves predicted by mond are noticeably different from the observed rotation curves .",
    "these were not considered falsifications of mond because for most of these galaxies the authors identified an obvious problem with the observed rotation curve ( e.g. , uncertain inclination or distance ) or with the use of the rotation curve as a tracer of the gravitational force ( e.g. , disturbed velocity fields ) .",
    "although mond appears to explain the magnitude of the discrepancy in spiral galaxies , it has has long been known that the theory predicts more matter than is observed in clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , sanders 1999 ) . in this sense the famous `` bullet cluster '' , which has been presented as direct emprical evidence for the existence of dark matter ( e.g. , clowe et al .",
    "2006 ) , does not pose a new problem for mond . additional undetected matter in some dissipationless form",
    "does seem to be required in clusters in the context of mond . in any case ,",
    "additional required matter is not formally a falsification of mond and in no sense detracts from the success of this algorithm on the scale of galaxies .",

    "bottema et al .  (",
    "2002 ) considered a sample of 4 spiral galaxies with well - measured rotation curves and cepheid - based distances determined as part of the hst program on the extragalactic distance scale ( sakai et al .",
    "two galaxies are in good agreement with mond predictions , but for ngc  2841 and ngc  3198 the rotation curves are not in agreement with mond , unless the distance to ngc  2841 is at least 20% larger , and the distance to ngc  3198 is at least 10% smaller than their cepheid distances indicate .",
    "bottema et al .  ( 2002 ) argued that ngc  3198 is probably consistent with mond within the uncertainties of the cepheid distance .",
    "with respect to ngc 2841 , milgrom and sanders ( 2008 ) have demonstrated that a reasonable match to the observed rotation curve can be achieved with alternative forms of the function that described the transition from the newtonian to the mond regime .",
    "dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies provide an especially good test for mond , because in most of these galaxies the acceleration is below the mond threshold of @xmath3  cm  s@xmath2 ( determined empirically from rotation curve fits , see e.g. , sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ) at all radii , whereas in high surface brightness spiral galaxies the acceleration is usually above the threshold in the inner parts . milgrom ( 1983b ) predicted that lsb galaxies should exhibit a large discrepancy between the detectable and newtonian dynamical mass within the optical disk , and this prediction has since been confirmed ( e.g. , de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ; swaters et al .",
    "2000 ) .    apart from this general prediction , the mond prescription is successful in predicting the detailed rotation curves of lsb galaxies as well .",
    "de blok & mcgaugh ( 1998 ) found that for their sample of 15 lsb galaxies all rotation curves are well fitted with mond , although for 6 galaxies modest adjustments of the inclination were necessary in order to get an acceptable match to the rotation curve .",
    "the sample presented in sanders & verheijen ( 1998 ) contains 12 lsb galaxies , and most of these the rotation curves can be well explained by mond as well .",
    "the results for dwarf galaxies show a fairly large spread .",
    "milgrom & braun ( 1988 ) concluded that the observed rotation curve of ddo  154 is in very good agreement with the rotation curve predicted by mond .",
    "lake ( 1989 ) considered a sample of 6 dwarf galaxies in the context of mond and concluded that acceptable fits require systematically lower values for @xmath0 than were found for spiral galaxies .",
    "in addition , lake ( 1989 ) found an apparent correlation between the asymptotic rotation velocity and the fitted value of @xmath0 .",
    "milgrom ( 1991 ) , however , pointed out that uncertainties in inclinations and distances can well explain the fact that mond appears to fail for these galaxies .",
    "the rotation curves of the dwarf galaxies included in the samples of begeman et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and sanders ( 1996 ) also agree well with those calculated with mond . on the other hand , blais - ouellette et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported that mond provides poor predictions of the rotation curves of the three dwarf galaxies in their sample , and reported that a higher value of @xmath0 is needed to make their rotation curves derived from fabry - perot observations consistent with mond .",
    "more recently , milgrom & sanders ( 2007 ) concluded that the rotation curves of the four low - mass galaxies in their sample are explain well in the context of mond .",
    "given this apparent spread in conclusions on whether mond correctly predicts the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies , we here test mond against a sample of rotation curves of dwarf and lsb galaxies that have recently become available in the literature . we included both dwarf and lsb galaxies because the physical properties of these galaxies are similar , although some dwarf galaxies have high surface brightness , and some lsb galaxies are large in size",
    ".    there are several difficulties inherent to such a sample .",
    "for example , because most dwarf galaxies are nearby , different methods to estimate the distance have been used , and this may introduce a dispersion in the derived parameters .",
    "inclination is another uncertainty for a class of objects which are known to be irregular with , in some cases , large scale asymmetries .",
    "moreover , the assumption that the rotation curve is a tracer of the radial force distribution may , itself , be questionable in cases where asymmetries are present .",
    "bearing these considerations in mind , one might not expect , a priori , the agreement between the predicted and observed rotation curves to be as good as noted for earlier samples .",
    "a systematic failure , however , would be problematic for mond .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ secsample ]",
    "we describe the sample used in this paper . in section  [ secfitproc ]",
    "we describe the fitting procedure , and in section  [ secfitres ] the fitting results .",

    ". finally , we present our conclusions in section  [ secconc ] .",
    "the sample we present here is compiled from data from five studies .",
    "a large fraction comes from the  rotation curves of a sample of 62 dwarf galaxies ( swaters 1999 ; swaters et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter ssah ) .",
    "the resolution of the hi data used to derive the rotation curves is @xmath4 . because of this relatively low resolution",
    ", the data have been corrected for beam smearing as described in swaters ( 1999 ) and ssah . from this original sample of 62 dwarf galaxies , we selected galaxies with inclination in the range @xmath5 , and we only included rotation curves that were classified by ssah as high quality .",
    "galaxies classified by ssah as having lower quality either have a signal - to - noise ratio that is too low , or are too asymmetric to derive a reliable rotation curve . to avoid the uncertainties associated with these low quality rotation curves",
    ", we have excluded these from our sample .",
    "the resulting sample contains 19 rotation curves .",
    "the second source is the sample of h@xmath6  rotation curves presented in swaters et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "they obtained high resolution rotation curves from h@xmath6  long - slit spectroscopy for a sample of 10 dwarf that are part of the ssah sample described above , and 5 lsb galaxies from the sample presented in de blok et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . as described in swaters et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , these h@xmath6  rotation curves have been combined with the  data presented ssah and de blok et al .",
    "galaxies with @xmath7 or @xmath8 were not included in the sample here .",
    "f568 - 3 was also excluded because of its strong bar .",
    "the third source is the sample of lsb galaxies presented in de blok , et al .",
    "they present long - slit h@xmath6  rotation curves for a sample of 30 lsb galaxies . from their sample",
    "we have selected those galaxies for which optical photometry and  imaging are available and with inclinations in the range @xmath9 .",
    "the fourth source is the sample presented in de blok & bosma ( 2002 ) , consisting of -h@xmath6  hybrid rotation curves . from this sample",
    "we have selected the galaxies that overlap with the ssah sample .",
    "we excluded ugc  3851 because its rotation curve depends heavily on the uncertain  rotation curve as derived by ssah and which they deemed to be of low quality .",
    "ugc  7524 was also excluded because this galaxy is well resolved by the  observations and the rotation curve derived from the two - dimensional data probably gives a better representation of the gravitational potential than the one derived from long - slit data .",
    "the rotation curves presented in de blok & bosma ( 2002 ) have been combined with the  rotation curves presented in ssah as described in de blok & bosma ( 2002 ) .",
    "the fifth and final source is the rotation curve of ugc  3371 presented in swaters et al .",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "they obtained high - resolution , two - dimensional h@xmath6  data for this galaxy .",
    "where the samples are overlapping , we have used them in this order of decreasing priority : swaters et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , swaters et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , de blok & bosma ( 2002 ) , de blok et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , ssah .",
    "most rotation curves in our sample have been derived from h@xmath6  data for the central parts and  data for the outer parts . however , for the 10 galaxies that came from ssah ( see column  2 in table  [ tabsample ] ) the rotation curves are entirely based on  data .",
    "we have not corrected the rotation curves in these samples for pressure support , because these corrections tend to be small in comparison to the rotation velocities , and probably uncertain ( see also ssah ) .",
    "the combined sample does not constitute a complete sample of dwarf and lsb galaxies .",
    "nonetheless , this sample contains galaxies with a wide range in luminosity and surface brightness for which high - quality rotation curve are available .",
    "this sample is therefore well suited to test mond in late - type dwarf and lsb galaxies .    because many of the galaxies in our sample are at small distances , their systemic velocities are a poor indicator of their distance .",
    "where possible , we use other distance indicators , based on the compilation of distances found in the literature presented in swaters & balcells ( 2002 ) , supplemented with other recent distance estimates based on the tip of the red giant branch ( mndez et al .",
    "2002 ; karachentsev et al .",
    "2003 ) . in order of decreasing priority ,",
    "the distances presented in table  [ tabsample ] are based on cepheids , the tip of the red giant branch , brightest stars , group membership , and the recession velocities corrected for virgocentric flow as described in swaters & balcells ( 2002 ) . for a more complete discussion on the distances to these dwarf galaxies , see swaters & balcells ( 2002 ) .",
    "the galaxies in our sample that are not in the ssah sample are all at large distances , and for these the distances have been calculated based on a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 , following sanders & mcgaugh ( 2002 ) .",
    "to calculate the mond rotation curves , we have used the same method as used in sanders ( 1996 ) and sanders & verheijen ( 1998 ) . to calculate the contribution of the stellar component to the disk",
    ", we have assumed that the stellar mass resides in an infinitely thin disk , that the @xmath11-band light accurately traces the mass distribution of the stellar component , and that the stellar mass - to - light ratio is constant with radius .",
    "the gas mass distribution is also assumed to be in a thin disk .",
    "we assumed that the  is optically thin , and we corrected for the mass fraction of helium by scaling the  mass by a factor of 1.32 .",
    "the optical radial profiles were taken from swaters & balcells ( 2002 ) , de blok et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and mcgaugh & bothun ( 1994 ) .",
    "the  radial profiles were taken from swaters et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , de blok et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and van der hulst et al .",
    "for the galaxies in which the  distribution is poorly resolved , we calculated the radial profiles following the algorithm described by warmels ( 1988 ) that uses a iterative deconvolution scheme ( lucy 1974 ) to correct for the effects of beam smearing ( see swaters et al .",
    "2002 for more details ) .",
    "for both the stellar and the gaseous disk , we assumed that the mass distribution is well represented by the radial average .    to calculate the mond rotation curves of the visible components , ideally the mond field equation of bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 )",
    "should be used . however , this is computationally expensive , and milgrom ( 1986 ) has shown that the differences between the results derived for the field equation and those from the original mond prescription are usually much smaller than , and practically never larger than 5% . therefore , we apply the usual mond formula : @xmath12 where @xmath0 is the mond acceleration parameter , @xmath13 is the mond acceleration , @xmath14 is the newtonian acceleration , and @xmath15 which is the commonly assumed form having the required asymptotic behaviour . for @xmath16 gravity",
    "is newtonian , and for @xmath17 gravity is of the mond form with @xmath18 .",
    "a little algebra shows that the rotation curve for mond can be expressed as : @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the radius and @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 the contribution of the stellar disk , bulge and gas to the rotation curve , respectively , calculated in the newtonian regime as described above , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the stellar mass - to - light ratios of the disk and the bulge .",
    "eq .  [ eqfit ] is fit to the observed rotation curve with a least - squares algorithm .",
    "none of the galaxies in our sample have significant bulges , which eliminates @xmath26 as a free parameter .",
    "it should be noted that in the context of mond the internal dynamics of a system is affected by the external acceleration field .",
    "if the external field becomes comparable to or larger than @xmath0 , a galaxy in this external field will always be in the newtonian regime , even if the internal accelerations are low ( milgrom 1983a , b ) .",
    "we made mond fits by fitting eq .",
    "[ eqfit ] to the observed rotation curves with a least squares algorithm . because @xmath0 is a universal constant in mond , we first made fits with only @xmath25 as a free parameter .",
    "following e.g. , sanders & mcgaugh ( 2002 ) , the acceleration parameter was fixed at @xmath27 cm  s@xmath2 ( @xmath28 km@xmath29 s@xmath2 kpc@xmath10 ) .",
    "in addition to the one parameter fits , we have also made mond fits with the distance and inclination as free parameters in order to investigate the effects of uncertainties in these parameters .",
    "in addition , we made fits with @xmath0 as a free parameter to measure @xmath0 and look for trends .",
    "the one - parameter mond fits , with only @xmath25 as a free parameter , are shown in figure  [ figfits ] . in each panel of this figure , the dots represent the measured rotation velocities and their uncertainties , the thin solid line shows the contribution of the stellar disk , and the dashed line the contribution of the hi .",
    "the best fitting mond rotation curve is indicated by the thick solid line .",
    "a first inspection of the mond fits presented in figure  [ figfits ] shows that roughly three quarters of the rotation curves are well fit by mond , with only @xmath25 as a free parameter .",
    "this is perhaps surprising , given the possible uncertainties due to inclination , distance , and asymmetries .",
    "a closer look shows that more than half of the galaxies deviate somewhat from the observed rotation rotation in a systematic way : the mond curve predicts higher rotation velocities in in the outer regions , and lower in the central regions .",
    "this is seen clearly in e.g. , ugc  6446 and ugc  12060 , and it is also visible , although less pronounced , in e.g. , ugc  731 and ugc  3371 .",

    "as is clear from the notes on individual galaxies and the fits shown in fig .",
    "[ figfits ] , for about a quarter of the galaxies in the sample there are noticeable discrepancies between the observed and the predicted curves , and in a few instances there are significant inconsistencies . on the one hand",
    ", these inconsistencies may signal a problem for mond , but , on the other , they might be the result of uncertainties associated with the galaxies in this sample . because mond fits are essentially one - parameter fits , with only the mass - to - light ratio of the stars as a free parameter",
    ", it is much more sensitive to observational uncertainties than fits with dark matter halos . for such fits with dark matter halos , any uncertainties in the rotation curve or in the contribution of the stars and gas , for example as a result of uncertainties in distance or inclination ,",
    "can be accommodated by changing the parameters of the dark matter halo .",
    "the mond fits , which are directly tied to the distribution of the gas and stars , can not accommodate these uncertainties . as a result",
    ", uncertainties in e.g. , the rotation curves , the distances , or the inclinations can lead to apparently good dark matter fits ( although likely with incorrect halo parameters ) , whereas the same uncertainties can lead to very poor mond predictions of the rotation curves .",
    "it is therefore imperative to consider the uncertainties that may play a role for the data presented here before we can discuss the implications of our results for mond .      given that the sample presented here consist in large part of nearby dwarf galaxies , uncertainties in distances will likely play a role .",
    "for those nearby galaxies , the distances have been determined with different methods : hubble flow , group membership , brightest stars , and tip of the red giant branch .",
    "some of these methods can produce uncertain distance measurements . as we have shown in this paper",
    ", the mond fits can be improved by adopting different distances .",
    "it is likely that in individual cases incorrect distance estimates have contributed to poor mond predictions of the rotation curves .",
    "however , it is unlikely that changes in distance alone can explain all the poor predictions , because that would require the galaxies in our sample to be preferentially closer , even galaxies at large distances which presumably have more accurate distances .    another important factor that may contribute to uncertainties in the mond fits are the inclinations of the galaxies in our sample . as described in section  [ incfits ] , many of the galaxies in our sample have irregular appearances and slowly rising rotation curves , making it difficult to determine their inclinations from either their morphology or their kinematics .",
    "moreover , towards more face - on galaxies , intrinsic noncircular shapes may lead to an overestimate of the inclination , and towards higher inclinations the uncertainties in the intrinsic thicknesses of these galaxies may affect the derived inclinations .",
    "thus , the inclinations of the galaxies in our sample may be uncertain .",
    "we have shown that the mond fits can significantly be improved by adopting different inclinations . moreover , for some galaxies , like ugc  4173 and ugc  12060 , the mond - preferred inclinations not only improve the mond fits , but also are compatible with the galaxies morphology and kinematics . in the case of ugc  4173",
    ", the mond - preferred inclination also brings the galaxy closer to the tully - fisher relation . however , for most galaxies the required changes in inclination are larger than the expected uncertainties . in addition , if changes in inclination would be the main cause of the poor mond predictions of the rotation curves , then the majority of the galaxies in our sample would have to be more face - on than the inclinations reported in table  [ tabsample ] .",
    "this could be possible if the galaxies in our sample have significant intrinsic ellipticities or strong bars . however , to explain differences of up to @xmath50 even at inclinations of about @xmath52 , we estimate an intrinsic ellipticity of 0.35 is needed .",
    "such large intrinsic ellipticities are not seen among late - type disk galaxies ( e.g. , schoenmakers et al .",
    "1997 ; andersen et al .",
    "2001 ) , although they might occur in low luminosity systems ( sung et al .",
    "1998 ) . however , there is little evidence of the perturbations in the velocity fields associated with such strong ellipticities ( schoenmakers et al .",
    "1997 ) in the velocity fields presented in swaters et al .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that all the poor mond predictions can be explained by uncertainties in the inclination alone , but it is likely that in some individual cases incorrect adopted inclinations can be the main reason for poor mond predictions .    naturally , it is also possible that both the adopted inclination and distance are incorrect .",
    "we investigated this in our fitting process but found that in all but a few of our fits , distance and inclination are generally strongly covariant , and in most cases it was not possible to constrain both of these parameters simultaneously .",
    "still , when compared to leaving only the distance or the inclination free in the fits , if both are left free , on average smaller changes are required to make the mond - predicted curve more compatible with observed rotation curve . at the same time , the required changes are still systematic , i.e. , on average the galaxies still need to be closer and more face - on .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties in distance and inclination , other factors may also play a role .",
    "these include beam smearing , noncircular motions , morphological asymmetries , corrections for asymmetric drift , and uncertainties in the photometric calibration .",
    "even though the  rotation curves presented here have been corrected for beam smearing ( see ssah ) , the inner rotation curve shape may be uncertain simply due to lack of resolution .",
    "for many galaxies in our sample high - resolution h@xmath6  rotation curves are available to mitigate this effect , but h@xmath6  rotation curves themselves may be uncertain because they are determined along a one - dimensional slice and not from the velocity field as a whole and hence are more susceptible to noncircular motions .",
    "in addition , the rotation curves presented here have not been corrected for asymmetric drift because it was deemed not to be important .",
    "another potential factor are morphological and kinematical asymmetries . not only can these affect the derived baryon distributions and rotation curves , they are also incompatible with the underlying assumption of axisymmetry used in calculating the mond - predicted rotation curves .",
    "all these factors combined could result in a derived rotation curve that is not representative of the true circular velocity .",
    "in addition to observational uncertainties , the quality of the fits may be affected by the fitting process and the associated assumptions .",
    "an example is the adopted thickness for the  and stellar disks . here , for ease of comparison with other studies",
    ", we have assumed that the gaseous and stellar disks are infinitely thin .",
    "compared to a stellar disk that is assumed to have a scale height of 0.2 disk scale lengths , as was adopted by swaters ( 1999 ) , the rotation curve calculated for an infinitely thin disk rises more steeply , on average by 15% , but reaching up to 40% for galaxies with central concentrations of light .",
    "the amplitude in the thin disk case is about 5 - 10% higher than in the thick disk case .",
    "thus , taking a thick disk in stead of a thin disk would results in m / ls that are 10% to 20% higher , and values for @xmath0 that are correspondingly lower .",
    "the rotation curve of the  is less sensitive to the adopted thickness .",
    "the difference between an infinitely thin disk and a disk with a scale height of 0.2 optical disk scale lengths is in general well below 5% , and hence the choice of thickness of the  disk has little influence on the fits .    another uncertainty on the results is the adopted form of @xmath53 ( see eq .",
    "[ eqmond ] ) , that describes the transition between the newtonian and mond regimes . in the results reported in the tables and figures in this paper ,",
    "we have used the commonly used form given in eq .",
    "we have also tried the form : @xmath54 as used by famaey & binney ( 2005 ) and mcgaugh ( 2008 ) .",
    "this revised transition formula results in more noticeable deviations from newtonian gravity at higher accelerations .",
    "this has an effect on the fits , and we looked in particular in terms of the possible correlation between @xmath0 and surface brightness as shown in fig .",
    "[ figa0vsmu ] . when eq .",
    "[ eqmu2 ] is used , galaxies that are deeper in the mond regime ( i.e. , the lsb galaxies ) tend to end up with lower values for @xmath0 , whereas the derived values for @xmath0 change little for high surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the fact that some of the rotation curves in our sample have been derived from a combination of  and h@xmath6  data might have affected our fit results , because the long - slit h@xmath6  data sample only a single slice through the velocity field , making them more sensitive to the effects of noncircular motions .",
    "in addition , the higher spatial sampling in the galaxy centers might bias the fits .",
    "however , any such bias would , at least partly , be offset by the usually larger uncertainties on the h@xmath6  rotation velocities .",
    "even though such a bias could have played a role , we find it does not for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "for all galaxies for which we have hybrid -h@xmath6  rotation curves , we have made fits to the -only rotation curves and found no significant differences .",
    "this is also illustrated by the fact that there are no systematic differences between the galaxies in our sample for which we have -only rotation curves , and those for which we have hybrid rotation curves .",
    "perhaps the biggest uncertainties on the derived parameters are from the fitting process itself .",
    "the values reported in table  [ tabfits ] are best - fit parameters .",
    "however , in some cases , the best - fit values suggest large changes in distance , inclination , or @xmath0 , even though the nominal values provide fits that are nearly as good in a @xmath55 sense ( e.g , ugc  5414 and f583 - 4 ) . in most of these cases ,",
    "the estimated uncertainties on the derived parameters are large , thereby indicating that a large range in parameter space produces fits of similar quality . in a number of cases , however , the best - fit values for the derived parameters are off from the nominal value by a large amount , even when a visual comparison of the mond fits and the fits with additional free parameters suggests that both fits are comparable in quality .",
    "examples of this are ugc  3371 , ugc  11861 , and f574 - 1 . in light of the uncertainties on the rotation velocity uncertainties , as was also mentioned in sec .",
    "[ secfitres ] , the best - fit values derived from the fits should not be taken at face value .",
    "we have found that the rotation curves as predicted by mond for the sample of dwarf and lsb galaxies presented in this paper are generally in good agreement with the observed rotation curves for roughly three quarters of the sample .",
    "this is remarkable , given that mond is a one parameter fit with only m / l as a free parameter .",
    "it is even more remarkable , in light of the uncertainties associated with a sample of low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies , as was discussed in more detail in the previous section . given these uncertainties , a fraction of around a quarter of galaxies for which mond does not adequately predict the observed rotation curves does not seem unexpected , and hence the differences between the observed rotation curves and the mond fits may not signal a failure of mond , but rather reflect the uncertainties associated with the galaxies in this sample .    despite these uncertainties ,",
    "there are a number of interesting results from our study .",
    "one is that the mond fits appear to deviate in a systematic way from the observed rotation curves . in almost 80% of the galaxies ( 21 out of 27 ) the mond curve predicts higher rotation velocities in the outer parts than are observed . in 40% of the galaxies in our sample , mond predicts rotation velocities that are higher by more than twice the uncertainty in the rotation velocity of the last measured point of the rotation curve . as we have shown , these discrepancies can be explained if these galaxies have different inclinations or distances . to explain the apparent systematic deviations between the mond curves and the observed rotation curves in terms of changes in distance or inclination , the galaxies in our sample need to be preferentially closer , need to have preferentially lower inclinations , or both , which seems unlikely .",
    "an alternative explanation for the fact that most mond - predicted curves tend to have higher rotation velocities in the outer parts than is observed , is that the value for @xmath0 is preferentially lower .",
    "of course , in mond @xmath0 is a universal constant and should not vary from galaxy to galaxy . in the mond fits presented here , we have adopted @xmath56 km@xmath29 s@xmath2 kpc@xmath10 ( e.g. , sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ) .",
    "if we average the @xmath0 derived from our fits with the acceleration parameter free , we find @xmath57 km@xmath29 s@xmath2 kpc@xmath10 , consistent with the value used by sanders & mcgaugh ( 2002 ) .",
    "however , as can be seen in [ figa0vsmu ] , most of our fits result in low values for @xmath0 . excluding the three highest values for @xmath0",
    ", we find @xmath58 km@xmath29 s@xmath2 kpc@xmath10 .",
    "thus , a somewhat lower value for @xmath0 would , on average , lead to improved fits for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we also have found what appears to be a correlation between @xmath0 and surface brightness .",
    "such a trend , if real , would be a problem for mond , because @xmath0 is a universal constant .",
    "however , it seems that this correlation is largely caused by a small number of galaxies at the high surface brightness end , for which large values for @xmath0 were found : ugc  5721 , ugc 7232 , ugc  7399 , ugc  7603 , and ugc  8490 . as we noted in sec .",
    "[ secindiv ] , ugc  5721 and ugc  7399 are compact galaxies with a central bar , and hence the inner rotation curve could be affected by noncircular motions .",
    "ugc  8490 has a strong warp , making the outer rotation curve less certain .",
    "ugc  7232 only has four points in its rotation curve and large uncertainties on the fitted value of @xmath0 . considering these factors , it is possible that the apparent correlation is the result of uncertainties , and not of a true underlying relation .",
    "previous studies of mond rotation curves that included lsb galaxies in their samples have not reported a trend between surface brightness and @xmath0 .",
    "de blok & mcgaugh ( 1998 ) analyzed the  rotation curves presented in de blok et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in the context of mond , and found most galaxies to be consistent with mond , although for a few adjustments to distance and inclination had to be made .",
    "the sample presented in sanders & verheijen ( 1998 ) contained 12 lsb galaxies , but the authors did not report a trend between @xmath0 and surface brightness .",
    "neither does an inspection of the lsb galaxies in their sample show the prediction by mond of systematically faster rotation in the outer rotation curves , like is seen in our sample , except for ugc  6446 , which is a galaxy also included in this sample .",
    "however , our sample extends more than a magnitude deeper in surface brightness , making the sample presented here more sensitive to effects that may play a role at low surface brightness .",
    "interestingly , it may be possible to explain , within the context of mond , why at least some galaxies would appear to have a low value for @xmath0 when @xmath0 is left as a free parameter in rotation curve fits . in the results presented here , we have only considered the accelerations within the galaxies themselves . however , whether an object is in the mond regime is determined by the overall acceleration , which includes external effects ( milgrom 1983a , b ) .",
    "thus , if an object , with internal accelerations that would place it in the mond regime , is placed in a newtonian external acceleration that is larger than @xmath0 , its kinematics would be entirely newtonian .",
    "if one were to fit @xmath0 in that case , one would derive a value of zero , because the object would never enter the mond regime .",
    "of course , the effects of the external fields are much smaller for the galaxies in our sample . even for the galaxy in our sample with the closest neighbor ( ugc  7577 , near ngc  4449 ) , the external acceleration is estimated to be @xmath59 cm s@xmath2 ( assuming a projected distance of 14.4 mpc ) .",
    "even though the amplitude of the external field is difficult to determine because it depends on the details of the galaxy environment , it can only lower the value of @xmath0 in fits where @xmath0 is left free . moreover , any external fields will have the strongest effects in lsb galaxies , where the internal accelerations are lowest .",
    "thus , while external fields may contribute to the apparent correlation between surface brightness and @xmath0 , it is difficult to establish this quantitatively .",
    "given the uncertainties in the distances , the inclinations , other observational uncertainties , uncertainties in the fitting process , and possible effects of external fields , it seems that the correlation between surface brightness and @xmath0 may not be significant .",
    "perhaps more certain is the finding that the galaxies in the sample presented here suggest a lower value for @xmath0 than the adopted value of @xmath60 km@xmath29 s@xmath2 kpc@xmath10 .    to thoroughly test mond in the lsb and dwarf galaxy regime ,",
    "galaxies are needed with reliable distance measurements and inclinations , well - resolved rotation curves and symmetric appearance , both in morphology and kinematics .",
    "none of the galaxies in our sample meet all these criteria simultaneously . however , there are four galaxies that meet all but one : ugc  3371 , ugc  6446 , ugc  7524 , and ugc  12632 .",
    "ugc  7524 is the only one with a reliable distance measurement from the trgb ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2003 ) , but it has asymmetric kinematics ( swaters et al .",
    "we have presented mond fits for a sample of 27 dwarf and lsb galaxies .",
    "mond is remarkably successful at predicting the general shape of the rotation curves in this sample . only for approximately a quarter of the galaxies mond",
    "does not adequately predict the observed rotation curves .",
    "this is remarkable given the uncertainties associated with the galaxies in this sample , especially the uncertainties in distance and inclination .",
    "close inspection of the fits indicates that for almost 80% of the galaxies mond predicts higher velocities in the outer rotation curves than is observed .",
    "although this could be the result of uncertainties , this systematic deviation can also be explained if the mond acceleration parameter is slightly lower than usually assumed , with a value of @xmath58 km@xmath29 s@xmath2 kpc@xmath10 ( or @xmath61 cm  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "we find that there appears to be some evidence of a correlation between @xmath0 and the central extrapolated disk surface brightness @xmath62 , but this possible correlation depends heavily on a few galaxies at high surface brightness , whose rotation curves may be uncertain because of bars or warps . at the low surface brightness end ,",
    "the derived values of @xmath0 could be be biased towards low values if external fields are important .",
    "overall , the uncertainties associated with this sample make it difficult to draw strong conclusions .",
    "improved distances and inclination estimates for these galaxies could make it possible to test mond more strongly ."
