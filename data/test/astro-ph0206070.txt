    "shortly after the burst of nova persei 1901 , a light echo was observed to emerge with superluminal expansion .",
    "it was later properly explained ( couderc 1939 ) to be the nova light scattered by dust nearby which reached us later than the unscattered photons due to light travel effects .",
    "the possibility of observing such an effect with supernovae was later discussed by many authors ( e.g. zwicky 1940 , schaefer 1987 ) .",
    "more than its splendid appearance , a light echo also sheds light on the circumstellar and interstellar environments through which it passes and the most famous example is from sn 1987a in large magelanic cloud .",
    "observations of re - emission from the rings around sn 1987a provide us the information on the geometry , distribution and composition of its circumstellar medium ( e.g. , lundqvist et al 1991 ) , help us to infer the stellar wind history of its pregenitor , and even enable us to determine an accurate distance to sn 1987a ( panagia et al .",
    "also , the monitoring of its scattered light echoes enables a three dimenional mapping of the structure of the interstellar medium in front of sn 1987a ( xu et al .",
    "1995 ) , which reveals aspects of dense clouds and superbubbles that are difficult to reveal by other means .",
    "this phenomenon has also been found in distant galaxies .",
    "for example , sn 1991 t , a luminous type ia supernova in ngc 4527 , exhibited a nearly flat light curve more than 950 days after maximum light , and spectral features that , although were present in earlier spectra , were substantially narrower and blueshifted on a significantly bluer continuum ( schmidt et al .",
    "schmidt et al . attributed these features to a light echo , which was later confirmed by hst foc observations ( sparks et al .",
    "similar photometric and spectroscopic behaviors in the late - time observations of sn 1998bu have led to suspicion of a light echo ( cappellaro et al .",
    "2001 ) , but it has yet to be confirmed by direct high - resoulution imaging .    due to limited spatial resolution ,",
    "direct imaging observations of supernova light echoes are possible only in our local supercluster , which makes these phenomena rare events .",
    "thus far , only nova persei 1901 , sn1987a , sn1991 t and sn1998bu are reported to have associated light echoes in the literature . here",
    "we report on a light echo around sn1993j , the fourth such event .",
    "the supernova sn1993j exploded on march 28 , 1993 in the spiral galaxy m81 , and due to its proximity ( 3.6 mpc ) , it has been observed and at wavebands from radio to @xmath0-ray regions .",
    "it began as a type ii supernova , but changed later to type ib at the nebular stage , and was classified as type iib .",
    "a series of observations with the very large baseline interferometer revealed an expanding radio shell that was decelerating ( bartel et al .",
    "1999 ) , reflecting the interaction between the shock front and the circumstellar medium .",
    "intensive photometric and spectroscopic observations also showed an infrared excess after day 50 , which may be indictive of an infrared echo ( lewis et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "in this paper we report an optical scattered light echo around sn 1993j that was dicovered in an hst wfpc2 observation . in @xmath12",
    ", we discuss our observations showing the light echo , and another archive hst wfpc2 observation with a nondetection of such a light echo .",
    "models for this light echo are discussed in @xmath13 , which give the geometry and dust properties . for the distance to sn 1993j",
    ", we use the distance to m81 , i.e. , 3.63 mpc ( @xmath2 , freedman et al . 1994 ) .",
    "as part of an observation of a different target , the wfpc2 was oriented so that sn1993j fell on a wide field chip ( wf4 ) during our 2000 second hst observations in the b , v , and i bands ( f450w , f555w , and f814w ) . the observation was obtained on june 4 , 2001 , 8.2 years after its explosion ; the data were analyzed following standard procedures .",
    "a light echo is clearly visible around sn1993j , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . this ring , which is most obvious in the f555w image , has a radius of about 1.9  ( 19 pixels ) and about 0.2  in width .",
    "this ring is a partial arc with the brightest part about 4.3  in length . for comparison ,",
    "another wfpc2 observation on jan .",
    "31 , 1995 ( i.e. , 1.8 years after sn1993j ) with supernova centered on the planetary camera was also extracted from the mast archive .",
    "there was no evidence of similar light echoes or partial arcs in the 1995 .",
    "the mean surface brightness of the arc was computed from those arc pixels that are brightest in the f555w image , excluded were those pixels that show a faint source in the f814w image .",
    "the background mean and sigma were computed from a square box centered on the arc , but excluding the arc and point sources .",
    "the net count rates ( in @xmath3 ) were then converted to surface brightness ( in @xmath4 ) using zeropoints appropriate for standard bvi photometry .",
    "the measured surface brightness and lower / upper limits in units of @xmath4 for @xmath5 errors in count rates are listed in table 1 . for the 1995 observation ,",
    "the @xmath6 detection threshold in the f555w image , defined by the standard deviation of the mean of a region which includes the positions of the observed 1.9  arc and the postulated 0.9  arc ( see section 3 ) , is @xmath7 , about 15 times fainter than the observed light arc .",
    ".surface brightness of the light echo [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have presented the wfpc2 observation of a light echo around sn 1993j after 8.2 years of supernova explosion .",
    "this light echo is due to light scattered from a dust cloud about @xmath8 in front of sn 1993j , about @xmath9 thick and @xmath10 wide , revealing the existence of a sheet of dust ( and gas ) in another galaxy .",
    "the dust inferred from the light echo surface brightness is 1000 times denser than the intercloud dust .",
    "the graphite to silicate fraction can not be determined by our bvi photometric measurements , however , a pure graphite model can be excluded based on comparison with the data .    aside from studying the geometric structure of the interstellar medium in other galaxies , a light echo can be used to determine the distance to the host galaxy . to accomplish this , one needs to measure the expansion rate of the light echo . with future observations",
    ", we should be able to determine this expansion rate and obtain a measurement of the distance independent of that obtained by using cepheid variables .",
