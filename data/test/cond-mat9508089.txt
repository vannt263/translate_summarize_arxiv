    "since the discovery of high@xmath1 superconductors@xcite , the @xmath0 quantum heisenberg model has received considerable attention .",
    "this is largely due to well - accepted experimental evidence that suggests that these compounds can be described@xcite by a two  dimensional ( 2d ) doped heisenberg model for spin @xmath0 .",
    "one of the experimental techniques used to study the excitations of these systems is raman scattering .",
    "this technique was intensely used in the past for different antiferromagnets of spin @xmath2 . for such systems , the main features of the line shape",
    "were explained by parkinson@xcite , who used a spin  wave theory to account for the photon  two - magnon process involved in the raman scattering .",
    "very good agreement@xcite was found for k@xmath3nif@xmath4 , which is well described by a spin @xmath5 heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "the results of raman experiments in the parent insulating compounds of high@xmath1 superconductors , la@xmath3cuo@xmath6 and yba@xmath3cu@xmath7o@xmath8 , show some qualitative differences with the line shape of previously studied antiferromagnets@xcite . as in the case of k@xmath3nif@xmath4",
    ", the line shape is centered at an energy corresponding to a spin  pair excitation .",
    "however , in contrast with the case of spin @xmath5 , the linewidth is very broad , and the spectrum has a very long tail that extends beyond the energy of four magnon excitations . moreover , while the dominant contribution to scattering is in the so  called @xmath9 channel , there is also a significant contribution in the nominally forbidden @xmath10 configuration@xcite .    since for lower spins",
    "the quantum fluctuations are larger , some theoretical analysis beyond the mean  field spin  wave approximation has been attempted to explain the broad line shape .",
    "numerical diagonalizations in a @xmath11 lattice shows very little structure for the @xmath9 channel : essentially three peaks ; a dominant two ",
    "magnon peak and two peaks identifiable as four  magnon excitations@xcite .",
    "this calculation gives vanishing line shape for the @xmath10 channel .",
    "although the structure of the line shape is clearly different from the one observed in the experiment , the first three moments of both lines are in good agreement .",
    "the first three moments of the distribution have been calculated in good agreement to experiment by singh _",
    "et al_. using cumulant expansions on a heisenberg model with diagonal next ",
    "neighbor couplings@xcite .",
    "canali and girvin@xcite used the dyson ",
    "maleev transformation taking into account processes of up to four magnons , and presented convincing evidence that the line shape can not be explained by quantum fluctuations alone .",
    "raman scattering hamiltonians with a four  site exchange@xcite term have been proposed , these increase the relative weight of the four  magnon scattering , but does not explain the broadening of the peas .",
    "this is also consistent with the work of sugai@xcite , and roger and delrieu@xcite .",
    "also , recent studies of spin  pair excitations in a spin @xmath5 system , nips@xmath7 , show a similar linewidth as those observed in the cuprates@xcite .",
    "from the above considerations , one concludes that it is necessary to invoke an additional process .",
    "it was emphasized by nori _",
    "et al_.@xcite that the spin ",
    "phonon interaction can be responsible for the broad linewidth , and for the finite cross  section in the otherwise absent @xmath10 channel .",
    "they supported their arguments by computing the raman cross section in finite lattices , using a heisenberg model with random _ static _",
    "exchange integrals , and averaging over configurations with equal weight .",
    "this calculation is in the spirit of the adiabatic or born ",
    "oppenheimer approximation@xcite , that neglects the fluctuations of the phonon field .",
    "adding phonons to the 2d @xmath0 heisenberg hamiltonian ( haf ) provides a mechanism@xcite for the otherwise forbidden @xmath10 scattering , as well as allowing a coupling between the ground and excited spin states . in a typical haf ,",
    "the phonon frequency@xcite is about a third of the interaction constant @xmath12 .",
    "the first excited state lies at @xmath13 , so there is an order of magnitude energy difference between spin and phonon excitations .",
    "it was argued@xcite that the separation of energy scales justifies the adiabatic phonon approximation .    in the present work we consider the raman scattering for a heisenberg model with spin ",
    "phonon interaction , including the effects of the phonon dynamics .",
    "we solve for the exact ground state of a system in which the vibrational degrees of freedom are allowed a finite number of excitations , an approximation valid for small but finite phonon frequencies .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first calculation of exact diagonalizations for a dynamic spin  phonon system . some work including phonon dynamics beyond the adiabatic approximation exists in the context of one  dimensional peierls systems .",
    "fradkin and hirsh@xcite studied the electron ",
    "phonon interaction using quantum monte carlo simulations , and proetto and falicov@xcite solved the case of two sites and one phonon .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present our hamiltonian and scattering operator and discuss the rationale for our truncated  phonon model . in sec .",
    "iii we present computational results and provide theoretical support for these results .",
    "we also present an alternative approach to including phonons and compare it to our model .",
    "iv is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we study a heisenberg model with spin  phonon interaction described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath14 \\vec s_{i } \\cdot \\vec s_{j } + \\omega_0 a^{\\dagger}_{ij}a_{ij } \\right \\ } \\label{h } \\,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 are spin @xmath16 operators , @xmath17 is a creation ( annihilation ) operator for an einstein phonon of frequency @xmath18 , and the simbol @xmath19 refers to a link of a square lattice . in @xmath20",
    "we include the coupling between the phonons and the spin degrees of freedom through a ",
    "displacement \" operator @xmath21 .",
    "our parameter @xmath22 in eq.([h ] ) is proportional to the spin ",
    "phonon coupling constant @xmath23 relating the change in the exchange integral @xmath24 with the displacement : @xmath25 .",
    "due to computational limitations , we need to restrict ourselves to a small number ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) of spins . to have these as two dimensional as possible",
    ", we placed them in non - periodic ladder type structures as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "we use einstein phonons to simplify the model , and we consider the highest  energy phonons as they are the closest in energy to the magnon excitations and will thus have the greatest coupling to the magnons .",
    "the occupation number of the phonon degrees of freedom at each link is in principle unrestricted ; the number of phonons ranges from zero to infinity .",
    "this makes the problem intractable from the point of view of exact diagonalizations , since the resulting hilbert space is infinite . in order to overcome this limitation",
    ", we restrict the possible number of phonons at each link by imposing the condition @xmath28 .",
    "computational resources limit us to using @xmath29 .",
    "this approximation maps the phonon degree of freedom into a two or three  state system at each link .",
    "the truncation of the phononic occupation states implies that the variations of @xmath30 due to quantum fluctuations are bounded .",
    "for example , for @xmath31 , the maximum displacements for a given link is given by the ",
    "coherent \" states @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "quantum fluctuations themselves are certainly limited by our truncation , but since they are in general small for small @xmath18 , our approximation will account for the relevant dynamics in the regime @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we are interested in the raman scattering intensity @xmath36 , given by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the eigenstates and @xmath39 the eigenvalues of @xmath40 .",
    "we compute @xmath41 by using the partial fraction expansion method of gagliano and balseiro@xcite . the relevant operator @xmath42 in eq.([sigmar ] )",
    "depends on the different configurations of the raman experiment . in general@xcite : @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 refer to the polarization of the incoming and scattered photon respectively , and @xmath46 are unit vectors in the near  neighbor directions of the lattice . for square lattices ,",
    "two common scattering configurations are the so  called @xmath9 and @xmath10 symmetries .",
    "we let the lattice axis lie along the @xmath47 and @xmath48 directions , and we define @xmath49 and @xmath50 the directions along the lattice diagonals ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , then @xmath9 corresponds to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , whereas @xmath10 corresponds to both the incident and scattered photon polarized in the same direction : @xmath55 .",
    "for the case of the  pure \" heisenberg hamiltonian ( no phonons , or @xmath56 ) , the absorption corresponding to the @xmath10 symmetry is zero at any non - zero frequency , since the @xmath10 operator is proportional to the hamiltonian .",
    "we show in the next section how the inclusion of the phonon dynamics gives rise to a finite absorption in this channel , and argue that a spin ",
    "phonon interaction accounts for the main features observed in the raman experiments in the undoped copper oxides . also , we compare the results obtained in the dynamical model with that of the heisenberg model with random ( static ) exchange integrals , which was studied in this context by nori _",
    "in this section we present numerical results for systems of @xmath26 and @xmath27 spins@xcite corresponding to the geometry shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "we first discuss the @xmath10 symmetry . in this case , and in the absence of lattice distortions , the raman operator commutes with the heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "no line shape is observed in this case : @xmath57 .",
    "it was first pointed out by nori _",
    "et al_.@xcite that the presence of _ static _ disorder in the exchange integrals @xmath30 changes the value of the commutator , and can give rise to a finite @xmath10 signal quite similar to experiments .",
    "it was argued by nori _",
    "et al_.@xcite that the spin  phonon coupling produces disorder in the values of @xmath30 , in the limit where the vibrational motions are much slower than the spin degrees of freedom . here ,",
    "we are interested in how this limit is achieved in a system that  up to boundary effects  is translationally invariant , and includes the _ dynamics _ of the spin  phonon coupling .",
    "consider our hamiltonian eq.([h ] ) and the operator @xmath42 for the @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "for @xmath58 , @xmath59 \\neq 0 $ ] and we expect a finite line shape . in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we show the @xmath60 obtained for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "some of the qualitative features of the experimental line shape are already present in these finite  size systems : there is a broad line shape of width @xmath63 with a maximum at the two  magnon energy .",
    "note that for our ladder geometries , since most sites have coordination number @xmath64 , the two  magnon energy in the ising limit is located at @xmath65 , instead of the corresponding @xmath13 of the square lattice .",
    "due to the finite size of the lattice , the line shape consists of a series of peaks that are centered at the unperturbed energies , which are indicated by arrows in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "these unperturbed energies correspond to the manifold of two  and multi  magnon states . in turn , these  internal \" peaks have a finite width that is due to the coupling with the phonons .",
    "the energy scale dominating this width is @xmath66 .    in order to test the validity of the hilbert space truncation",
    ", we have increased the number of allowed excitations per phonon by one , with no qualitative changes in the line shape ( see fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] )    it is interesting to consider the following two limiting cases : @xmath67 vanishing spin - phonon coupling @xmath68 for finite phonon frequency @xmath18 , and @xmath69 vanishingi phonon frequency @xmath70 for finite @xmath66 . in both limits the @xmath10 line shape vanishes . in @xmath67",
    ", the spins are uncoupled from the phonons , and the line shape vanishes because in this limit @xmath59=0 $ ] .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] illustrates how the line shape vanishes and shifts to lower energies as @xmath68 . in limit @xmath69 ,",
    "the phonons are ",
    "static \" , but remain coupled to the spins , because @xmath71 . since the phonons have no dynamics , the eigenstates can be written in the form @xmath72 is a static configuration of displacements , in such a way that , for each link @xmath73 , one has @xmath74 , with @xmath75 a @xmath76number .",
    "the state @xmath77 involves spin degrees of freedom only , and is an eigenstate of the following hamiltonian @xmath78   \\vec s_{i } \\cdot \\vec s_{j }     \\ , .\\ ] ]    for @xmath79 , the problem is that of an _ annealed _ configuration of displacements : for each configuration @xmath80 , the couplings @xmath30 are different , and one has to solve for the spin dynamics in the presence of this distribution of couplings .",
    "the complete spectrum is obtained by solving @xmath81 decoupled eigenvalue problems , with @xmath81 being the phononic hilbert space dimension . for our case of one excitation per link , @xmath82 , with @xmath83 being the number of links of the lattice .",
    "what distinguishes this from a quenched disorder is the fact that the ground state of this problem corresponds to the lowest energy state of the spin system in an _ ordered _ background of couplings .",
    "since this is also an eigenstate of @xmath42 for the @xmath10 symmetry , the line shape will be zero . in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] we show how the line shape vanishes as @xmath18 decreases to zero",
    ". note that from this analysis one concludes that , even in the case of @xmath79 , the line shape is non  zero at finite temperature .",
    "this is due to the presence of thermally excited states , which are eigenstates of a hamiltonian that does not commute with @xmath42 .",
    "the right column of figure [ figure5 ] shows the rescaled results , which illustrate the line shape approaching a limiting function of @xmath84 whose overall amplitude vanishes as @xmath70 .",
    "the main features of this limiting function should be accounted for by a model of static disordered couplings . in previous work in the context of one  dimensional peierls",
    "systems@xcite , it is argued that in the limit of small phonon frequencies , the quantum lattice fluctuations can be modeled by a static , random gaussian potential with zero mean .",
    "a model in which the exchange integrals are taken from a random configuration of couplings was also studied by nori _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "we can test this hypothesis in our dynamical model .",
    "results of the comparison between the dynamical and a static disordered system are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] .",
    "note that both the amplitude and the position of the peaks are in very good mutual agreement .",
    "the scattering peaks from the two models have their energies scaled with respect to each other .",
    "after they are rescaled , the location and magnitude of the peaks are very close for both models ( see fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] ) .",
    "the basis for this rescaling of the horizontal axis is the following . for our dynamic phonon model",
    ", the minimum energy state corresponds to the lattice  maximally compressed \" : @xmath85 .",
    "the tendency of the system to compress has the effect of renormalizing the interaction coefficient @xmath12 , since the displacement @xmath86 will tend to be a constant , and therefore @xmath87 .",
    "the average displacement will be greater as the possible number of excitations increases ; this explains a shift in energy between @xmath88 and @xmath89 excitations as well .    in the model with static disorder",
    ", the phonon energy goes to zero , but the fluctuations are still present . in the treatment of nori _",
    "et al_.@xcite the argument used is that the phonon energy is small compared to that of the spin excitations , and thus can be neglected .",
    "however , we have shown that for @xmath90 strictly zero the line shape vanishes .",
    "at zero temperature , the disordered model should be compared with the dynamical model at infinitesimal @xmath18 .",
    "we prove this statement by using perturbation theory in @xmath18 .",
    "assume an ordering of the states for @xmath91 , and let us label those states by the index @xmath92 .",
    "if @xmath93 and @xmath94 , each state @xmath95 splits in a manifold @xmath96 of almost degenerate states of energies @xmath97 , that correspond to the  disordered \" configurations .",
    "if we now turn on @xmath18 , different states are going to mix , in such a way that the ground state can be written as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the ordered configuration of couplings .",
    "a similar expansion can be used for the excited states .",
    "if we use the fact that @xmath10 @xmath42 acts only on the spin degrees of freedom , and that different states @xmath100 are orthogonal , to lowest order in @xmath18 , @xmath60 will be given by @xmath101    we have found computationally a falloff of @xmath60 proportional to @xmath102 .    now , if we keep the assumption of @xmath93 , the states corresponding to each manifold are almost degenerate and we can approximate @xmath103 , with @xmath104 the number of configurations @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , in this limit @xmath60 is given by an average over configurations with _ equal _ weight .",
    "we now present results for the @xmath9 configuration . in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] we compare the @xmath9 scattering from eight @xmath0 heisenberg spins for three different cases : bare haf , with phonon interactions , and with static disorder .",
    "we have argued that peaks at higher excitations will eventually merge into one broad peak as the lattice size increases . to show that this is the case",
    ", we have calculated the @xmath10 and @xmath9 peaks for a @xmath105 non  periodic lattice with static disorder .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] .",
    "these are in good qualitative agreement with experiments , except that the experimental scattering is centered at @xmath106 instead of @xmath65 in our case .",
    "this is due to finite size effects and to the lattice being non  periodic .",
    "the model with static disorder , when extended to larger numbers of spins than can be obtained with the dynamic phonon model , begins to duplicate experiments .",
    "the agreement between the static and dynamic phonon models suggests that the dynamic phonon model will also agree with experiments .",
    "in this paper we have presented a model of phonon - magnon interaction with a truncated phonon space .",
    "we discussed how this model can explain the otherwise forbidden @xmath10 scattering and showed that it does in fact give rise to @xmath10 scattering .",
