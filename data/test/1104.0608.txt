    "the discovery of conducting properties of doped polyacetylene @xcite in 1977 led to a nobel prize in chemistry establishing a whole new field of organic electronics .",
    "after decades of research , many families of the organic semiconducting materials have been investigated . among them , oligoacenes @xcite and oligothiophenes @xcite have been examined intensively due to the possibility of making single crystals with few defects via repeated sublimation processes .",

    "@xcite , charge transport in organic semiconductors is governed by electronic coupling and electron - phonon interactions , and the main transport mechanism can be described by polaron and disorder models .",
    "many theories on polaron transport are based upon a phenomenological model @xcite or utilize the polaron effective mass approach @xcite .",
    "however , validity of these models is restricted to specific parameter ranges .",
    "more general microscopic models in understanding polaron transport was developed @xcite from a density matrix approach , which is capable of describing electronic coupling , diagonal and off - diagonal electron - phonon interaction of arbitrary strength over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "the effect of off - diagonal coupling poses much more difficulties to tackle than its diagonal counterpart , and as a result , off - diagonal coupling has not been extensively treated before @xcite .",
    "more recently , microscopic models from generalized master equation approach @xcite , and dynamical mean - field theory @xcite have been developed .",
    "polaron transport theory developed by holstein in his seminal work@xcite was based upon perturbation expansions with its validity sometimes limited to cases of small transfer integrals @xcite . despite its limitation ,",
    "the theory has been widely used for qualitative interpretations of experimental data , including the temperature dependence of band - narrowing effect as well as the crossover from band - like behavior to hopping transport with increasing temperature . a microscopic transport theory that accounts for simultaneous diagonal and off - diagonal electron - phonon coupling",
    "was developed by munn and silbey@xcite based on a canonical transformation of the hamiltonian with an element of optimization . off - diagonal coupling",
    "is found to increase the polaron binding energy and introduce new minima and broadening to the polaron band .",

    "this approach has been borrowed to treat two phonon bands in a three - dimensional lattice by parris and kenkre@xcite . however , as the yarkony - silbey approach lacks the flexibility in variational parameters , a more sophisticated approach is needed to capture the correct temperature dependence of diffusion coefficient and mobility . to obtain",

    "the theory is able to capture the universal band - like - to - hopping transition as temperature increases , and more importantly , a temperature - independent mobility at extremely low temperature has been found in agreement with a nonperturbative approach recently developed by ortmann _",
    "however , merrifield s transformation itself is applicable only in the small polaron regime , and the off - diagonal exciton - phonon coupling was not accounted for in ref .",
    "@xcite , making the approach insufficient to describe the phonon assisted transport / tunneling@xcite in molecular crystals .",
    "thus , further improvements are necessary for cases with simultaneous diagonal and off - diagonal coupling .",
    "following up on the munn - silbey transformation method , zhao _ _ et al.__@xcite devised a self - consistent routine to determine the transformation coefficients , demonstrating substantial corrections of the polaron band structure thanks to a built - in momentum dependence of the transformation coefficients .",
    "this serves as the starting point towards the evaluation of transport properties in this paper .",

    "this model was able to adequately explain the temperature dependence and anisotropy of measured mobilities in naphthalene .",
    "using master equations , wang _ et al . , _",

    "a more sophisticated microscopic model based on a hamiltonian of the holstein - peierls type has been presented by bobbert and colleagues @xcite .",
    "very recently , a theory based on non - perturbative evaluation of kubo formula for the carrier mobility@xcite has been proposed , showing several improvements including the elimination of low - temperature singularity that often appears in theories based on narrow - band approximations .",
    "based on a non - perturbative evaluation of the kubo formula , calculations have been carried out for durene crystals@xcite and guanine based materials@xcite , and transport channels of charge carriers are revealed by making use of ab - initio tools .",
    "coupling to the intermolecular acoustic modes @xcite was found to play a significant role in charge transport , thus the model presented by bobbert _",
    "_ may be improved further .",
    "experimental data of naphthalene can be well reproduced by this model with microscopic parameters obtained from ab - initio calculations . however , this model neglects the intra - molecular modes as well as the coupling of excitons to the intermolecular acoustic phonons , and only the coupling to the optical modes is accounted for .",

    "et al . , _",
    "and by munn and silbey , are based on nonlocal canonical transformations with additional approximations .",

    "hence , in the light of recent theories by hultell _ _ et al.__@xcite and troisi _ _ et al.__@xcite , it is clear that both local and nonlocal exciton - phonon interactions should be taken into account .",
    "a comprehensive theory of the charge transport in organic crystals requires treatments of the hamiltonian having the lattice dealt with quantum mechanically in order to make itself valid for any temperature of interest , and the munn - silbey approach@xcite combined with the self - consistent routine devised by zhao _ _",
