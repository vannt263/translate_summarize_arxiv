    "binary systems , whose behavior crucially depends on the underlying condition of immiscibility or miscibility @xcite , play a fundamentally important role in many areas of physics . in the case of immiscibility , a major effect is the formation of domain walls ( dws ) between regions occupied by immiscible components . commonly known are dws in media featuring a vectorial order parameter , such as ferromagnets @xcite , ferroelectrics @xcite , and liquid crystals @xcite . in self - defocusing optical media ,",
    "dws separate regions occupied by electromagnetic waves with orthogonal circular polarizations of light haelt , me .",
    "similar interface patterns were predicted in arrays of nonlinear optical waveguides , modeled by discrete nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nlses ) @xcite .",
    "dws are known in superfluids too , where they are formed by immiscible binary bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , as predicted theoretically @xcite and demonstrated in experiments @xcite . in the mean - field approximation @xcite ,",
    "such settings are modeled by systems of nonlinearly coupled gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) with the cubic self - repulsive nonlinearity , which are similar to coupled nlses describing the above - mentioned optical dws @xcite . in their stationary form , these equations coincide with coupled cubic ginzburg - landau equations modeling dws in dissipative patterns , such as interfaces between rolls with different orientations in large - area rayleigh - benard convection @xcite .    the analysis of the dws in bec was extended for broader settings , including linear interconversion between the immiscible components  ( this is possible when they represent two different hyperfine states of the same atom coupled by a resonant radiofrequency wave ) @xcite , dipolar @xcite and spinor ( three - component ) condensates @xcite , as well as the bec discretized by trapping in a deep optical - lattice ( ol ) potentials mering .",
    "furthermore , the study of the dws was recently extended for immiscible binary becs  with three - particle collisions @xcite , in the case when the related losses may be neglected , the respective coupled gpes featuring the cubic - quintic repulsive nonlinearity @xcite .    in the",
    "effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) setting , ultracold bosonic gases with strong inter - atomic repulsion may be cast in the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) state , which emulates the gas of non - interacting fermions @xcite , provided that the energy of the repulsive interaction between bosons exceeds their kinetic energy , while the opposite situation corresponds to the becphase in the bosonic gas ( a review of the tg model was given in ref .",
    "the tg gas of hard - core bosons has been realized experimentally , using tight transverse confinement @xcite .",
    "in particular , a longitudinal ol potential was used to increase the effective mass in the trapped state , thus making the kinetic energy small enough @xcite .",
    "it is commonly known that gpes furnish very accurate description of the bec in atomic gases . a similar macroscopic model of the tg gas",
    "is offered by the nlse with the quintic self - repulsion term @xcite . in a rigorous form , the relevance of the corresponding sextic term in the free - energy density of the three - dimensional bosonic gas in its ground state , which reduces to the quasi-1d tg phase , was demonstrated in ref .",

    "further , oscillation frequencies derived from fermionic hydrodynamic equations , which apply to the hard - core tg gas , were found to be close to their counterparts predicted by the quintic nlse hydro .",
    "coupled quintic nlses also arise in works aimed at constructing the ground state of a binary tg mixture in the harmonic - oscillator potential by means of the density - functional method @xcite . on the other hand , this approach may not apply to tg gases beyond the framework of static configurations and hydrodynamic regimes . in particular",
    ", it fails for strongly non - equilibrium problems , such as merger of distinct gas clouds @xcite .",
    "as concerns the mixtures , it may be interesting to consider binary systems including the tg gas and another quantum - gas component .",
    "in particular , exact solutions  were found for the ground state of tg - fermi mixtures minguzzi .",
    "the binary gas of impenetrable bosons is solvable too ctg - ba .",
    "the objective of the present work is to introduce basic nonlinear complexes , such as dws , bubble - drop ( bd ) modes ( bound pairs of two dws ) , and dark - bright solitons ( dbss ) , in an immiscible system of tg and bec gases . in the experiment , the system may be realized , in particular , as a bosonic gas composed of two atomic species under tight transverse confinement , with a longitudinal ol potential acing on ( being relatively close to a resonance with ) one species only .",
    "then , as the experimental setting presented in ref .",
    "@xcite suggests , a large effective mass of the near - resonant component will bring it into the tg state , while the other component may stay in the bec phase .    as a model for this system , in section ii we adopt the cubic gpe for the self - repulsive bec component coupled by the cubic ( collisional ) repulsive term to the quintic nlse for the tg species .",
    "the use of the latter equation is appropriate , as we study only static configurations of the system .",
    "the same model may find a realization in optics as a model of colloidal waveguides .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated that , selecting the size of metallic nanoparticles in the colloid and their concentration , one can engineer desirable coefficients of the corresponding cubic and quintic nonlinearity @xcite . in particular , it is possible to design a waveguide which features a nearly pure quintic nonlinearity at a particular wavelength , while the cubic response dominates at a different wavelength .",
    "the copropagation of optical signals carried by these wavelengths will then emulate the tg - bec system .",
    "dws separating the bec and tg phases are addressed in section iii .",

    "we have introduced a binary system in the form of an immiscible pair of bec and tg quantum gases , in the effectively 1d setting . using the system of the gpe for the bec , nonlinearly coupled to the quintic nlse for the tg component , we have analyzed the possibility of the existence of three types of interfaces in this binary system : dws ( domain walls ) , bds ( bubble - drops ) , and bdss ( bright - dark solitons ) .",
    "the same model applies to a bimodal light propagation in a specially designed colloidal medium in optics .",
    "the immiscibility condition for the binary system of the present type was obtained in the general form .",
    "analytical results were produced by means of the tfas ( thomas - fermi approximations ) , in the combination with the systematic numerical analysis .",
    "the dws have been found an explicit analytical form , by means of the tfa , and in the generic form numerically .",
    "the analysis and numerical results demonstrate that the bds exist solely in the form of the tg drop immersed into the bec background , while the bds complexes may be built equally well of the tg bright and bec dark components or vice versa .",
    "thus , the predicted results suggest new experiments with tightly confined two - species mixtures of ultracold bosonic gases . the analysis can be extended for a chain of bds and/or dbss in a long system , including a circular one , which corresponds to the binary gas loaded into a tight toroidal trap @xcite .",
