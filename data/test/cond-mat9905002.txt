    "the direction dependence can also be explained by the direction - dependent proportionality constant between the effective staggered field and applied uniform field .",

    "<S> recent experiments on the s=1/2 antiferromagnetic chain compound , cu benzoate , discovered an unexpected gap scaling as approximately the 2/3 power of an applied magnetic field . a theory of this gap , based on an effective staggered field , orthogonal to the applied uniform field , resulting from a staggered gyromagnetic tensor and a dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , leading to a sine - gordon quantum field theory , has been developed . </S>",
    "<S> here we discuss many aspects of this subject in considerable detail , including a review of the s=1/2 chain in a uniform field , a spin - wave theory analysis of the uniform plus staggered field problem , exact amplitudes for the scaling of gap , staggered susceptibility and staggered magnetization with field or temperature , intensities of soliton and breather peaks in the structure function and field and temperature dependence of the total susceptibility . </S>"
