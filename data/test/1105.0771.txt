    "the astrophysicist subrahmanyan chandrasekhar once referred to black holes as `` the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe : the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time.''@xcite this special issue of journal of physics a is devoted to a completely different topic , the quantum - mechanical amplitudes for the scattering of relativistic particles , in which a revolution in our understanding has been taking place recently .",
    "however , scattering amplitudes represent a kind of short - distance complement to the perfection chandrasekhar saw in black holes .",
    "we might consider them to be the most perfect microscopic structures in the universe .",
    "black holes are gigantic and ( almost ) eternal .",
    "scattering amplitudes , in contrast , portray events that wink in and out of existence much faster than the blink of an eye .",
    "they describe processes at the shortest distance scales that can be probed in the laboratory . when gravitons scatter , interacting via einstein s field equations , again in some sense the only elements in the construction are our concepts of space and time  although the boundary conditions at infinity can be more detailed than for black holes , involving multiple plane - wave ripples ( the gravitons ) propagating in various directions through minkowski space - time . when other relativistic particles scatter , as in non - abelian gauge theory , more information has to be provided , such as the gauge group , the coupling constant , the matter content of the theory , the particle masses , and the precise set of particle types and spins being scattered",
    ". however , in the ultra - relativistic limit , if there are only gauge interactions , much of the group - theoretical information can be stripped from the amplitudes , and certain color - ordered `` primitive '' amplitudes can be defined which are quite universal .",
    "these amplitudes have intricate analytic properties , which have been teased out over the decades , but especially in the past few years . a variety of new , efficient techniques have been found to construct amplitudes , and hidden symmetries have been identified which illustrate the amplitudes `` perfection . ''    in the real universe , black holes are not found in an absolute vacuum . typically they are surrounded by accretion disks of gas and dust , which muddy their perfection somewhat , but also enrich the range of phenomena involving them , and make them much easier to observe , albeit indirectly .",
    "similarly , scattering amplitudes for quantum chromodynamics , or qcd , the most relativistic non - abelian gauge theory we can study in the laboratory , are shrouded from direct view by confinement .",
    "the quarks and gluons that theorists scatter mentally are never seen experimentally . in the initial state of a hadronic collision",
    "they are bound into a proton or other hadron . in the final state",
    "they emerge as collimated jets of particles . despite this fact , quantities that are sensitive only to very short distances , so - called infrared - safe observables such as jet production cross sections ,",
    "can be computed reliably in terms of quarks and gluons , in a systematic expansion in the strong coupling @xmath1 .",
    "if we could go to asymptotically high energies , so that @xmath1 were infinitesimal , it would be enough to consider just the leading order in this expansion , which is generated by the born approximation , or tree - level amplitudes .",
    "the tree - level amplitudes of qcd have even more `` perfection '' than the generic , loop - level amplitudes , because they coincide with the tree amplitudes of a much more symmetric theory , @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( @xmath0 sym ) .",
    "this theory , which is the subject of many of the articles in this special issue , has the maximum amount of supersymmetry possible in a gauge theory .",
    "its four supercharges can be used to transform the helicity @xmath2 gluon state , by @xmath3 unit of helicity at a time , all the way to the helicity @xmath4 cpt conjugate gluon state .",
    "all states in the theory belong to a single supermultiplet , transforming in the adjoint representation of the gauge group",
    ". therefore all interactions are related by supersymmetry to the triple - gluon vertex , and the theory has a single dimensionless coupling @xmath5 . the @xmath6 function for @xmath0 sym vanishes exactly for any gauge group , @xmath7 , so that the theory is exactly conformally invariant at the quantum level , as well as classically .",
    "( the classical conformal invariance of qcd with massless quarks is of course spoiled by its nonvanishing one - loop @xmath6 function , which leads to asymptotic freedom . )    in investigations of scattering amplitudes in @xmath0 sym , the gauge group under consideration is usually su@xmath8 . quite often , the limit @xmath9 is also taken , at a fixed value of the t  hooft coupling , @xmath10 . for @xmath11 ,",
    "perturbation theory can be applied , and for large @xmath12 only planar feynman diagrams contribute . for @xmath13 ,",
    "perturbation theory breaks down , but the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite can be used . in the large-@xmath12 or planar limit of @xmath0 sym , even more remarkable symmetries and relations emerge for scattering amplitudes .",
    "as we will discuss further below , these properties include dual conformal ( super)symmetry , which is part of a larger yangian invariance ; a description of amplitudes in terms of spaces of complex planes ( grassmannians ) ; and in terms of various types of twistors ; and a relation between scattering amplitudes and the expectation values of wilson loops for closed polygons bounded by light - like edges .",
    "many of these properties are intimately connected with a strong - coupling picture of gluon scattering in terms of strings moving in anti - de - sitter space  @xcite .",
    "the exceptional simplicity and numerous hidden symmetries of @xmath0 sym have made it a playground for theorists interested in scattering amplitudes for a couple of decades .",
    "this interest has accelerated rapidly in the past few years . because the tree - level amplitudes of qcd and @xmath0 sym coincide , the early discoveries about qcd helicity amplitudes , motivated by the physics of jet production , were also discoveries about @xmath0 sym .",
    "for example , the parke - taylor formula  @xcite for the maximal - helicity - violating ( mhv ) sequence of @xmath14-gluon amplitudes , which is just a single - term expression , even for an arbitrarily large value of @xmath14 , is also consistent with all the symmetries of @xmath0 sym  @xcite , including some that were only unveiled decades later .",
    "many general properties of tree amplitudes were understood early on , such as their factorization properties  @xcite and the ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) supersymmetry ward identities that they obey  @xcite . however , a fuller understanding and exploitation of these properties have come only in recent years .",
    "for instance , the complete solutions of the long - known @xmath0 supersymmetry ward identities , and the corresponding @xmath17 identities in supergravity , have been worked out recently by elvang , freedman and kiermaier  @xcite , and are reviewed here  @xcite .",
    "several years ago , witten  @xcite discovered that the twistor space developed decades earlier by penrose  @xcite gave a natural description of tree - level amplitudes in massless gauge theory .",
    "as discussed in , such amplitudes have a natural description in terms of two - component weyl spinors , a left - handed and a right - handed spinor for each external state .",
    "to go to twistor space , one performs a fourier transform on half the variables , namely the left - handed spinors , leaving the right - handed ones alone .",
    "witten found that gauge theory could be reformulated in terms of a topological string moving in twistor space .",
    "gauge amplitudes turn out to be localized on particular curves in twistor space . in one approach , the curves are intersecting lines : a single line for the simplest mhv amplitudes , a pair of lines for the next - to - maximally - helicity - violating ( nmhv ) amplitudes , and so on .",
    "this version gave rise to the csw or mhv rules for gauge theory  @xcite , whose mhv vertices are a particular off - shell continuation of the parke - taylor formulae . these developments are reviewed here by brandhuber , spence and travaglini  @xcite , and by adamo , bullimore , mason and skinner  @xcite .",
    "the latter reference also discusses another class of twistors , namely momentum twistors , which also provides a natural set of kinematic variables for amplitudes , in that they automatically satisfy the kinematic constraints of momentum conservation and the mass - shell conditions .",
    "finally , the correspondence between wilson loops and scattering amplitudes is described in this article  @xcite from the perspective of twistor space .",
    "britto , cachazo , feng and witten ( bcfw )  @xcite recognized that factorization properties are powerful enough to allow the derivation of recursion relations  @xcite for tree amplitudes , in terms of on - shell lower - point amplitudes , which are evaluated at particular complex momenta .",
    "this observation , reviewed here by brandhuber , spence and travaglini  @xcite , makes essential use of the analyticity , or _",
    "plasticity _ , of amplitudes ; that is , how they vary under smooth deformations of the kinematics .",
    "bcfw embedded an amplitude @xmath18 into a one - complex - parameter family of on - shell amplitudes @xmath19 with shifted complex momenta , and associated the poles of @xmath19 in the @xmath20 plane with factorization of the amplitude onto simpler lower - point amplitudes .",
    "one can also construct a supersymmetrized version of the bcfw recursion relation , in which grassmann variables @xmath21 associated with @xmath0 supersymmetry are shifted along with the momenta  @xcite .",
    "this recursion relation can be solved explicitly to yield all tree amplitudes in @xmath0 sym  @xcite ; the solution and its many symmetries are reviewed here by drummond  @xcite .",
    "scattering amplitudes in massless gauge theories all have quite similar structure at tree level , once the color factors have been stripped off , as discussed in .",
    "on the other hand , the structure of loop amplitudes depends critically on the theory .",
    "the simplicity of one - loop multi - gluon amplitudes in @xmath0 sym played a key role in the development of the unitarity method  @xcite .",
    "this method reconstructs loop amplitudes from their unitarity cuts , again exploiting analyticity . in general at one loop , as explained in this issue by britto  @xcite and ita  @xcite , unitarity cuts are matched against a decomposition of the amplitude in terms of a set of scalar integrals  boxes , triangles , bubbles and ( sometimes ) tadpoles  in order to determine the coefficients of the integrals . in @xmath0 sym ,",
    "the high degree of supersymmetry implies that only boxes have non - vanishing coefficients . using unitarity , an infinite sequence of one - loop amplitudes ( the mhv amplitudes )",
    "could be determined in @xmath0 sym from just the product of two tree - level mhv ( parke - taylor ) amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "later , generalized unitarity was applied to the problem of computing one - loop amplitudes , by extracting additional information from products of three and four tree amplitudes , the so - called triple  @xcite and quadruple  @xcite cuts .",
    "quadruple cuts have four on - shell conditions .",
    "these four equations determine the four components of the ( four - dimensional ) loop momenta completely , up to a ( possible ) two - fold degeneracy .",
    "this realization allows the box coefficients to be computed very simply in terms of the product of four tree amplitudes , glued together as the four corners of a box , and evaluated at each of the two solutions for the loop momenta  @xcite . for @xmath0 sym , there are no other coefficients to determine , so the one - loop problem has been `` reduced to quadrature . ''",
    "( it turns out that maximal @xmath17 supergravity can be proven to have the same `` no - triangle '' property  @xcite , so it too is solved at one loop by the quadruple cuts . )",
    "generalized unitarity can also be applied very effectively at the multi - loop level . in principle",
    "it can be used for any gauge ( or gravitational ) theory . as an example , the two - loop four - gluon scattering amplitudes in qcd have been computed in this way  @xcite . in practice",
    "the method has been pushed the furthest in @xmath0 sym .",
    "the basic techniques of multi - loop generalized unitarity are reviewed here by bern and huang  @xcite , and by carrasco and johansson  @xcite .",
    "returning now to one - loop amplitudes for generic gauge theories , including qcd , the triangle and bubble coefficients have to be determined , as well as certain _",
    "rational parts _ , which have no unitarity cuts in four dimensions .",
    "the triple cuts contain information about the triangle coefficients , but they also receive contributions from boxes . similarly , the ordinary double cuts determine the bubble coefficients , once the contributions of triangles and boxes are removed .",
    "this separation can be done analytically , by making use of the different analytic behavior of the different types of cut integrals , as reviewed by britto  @xcite .",
    "it can also be done numerically , by a suitable sampling of the continuum of loop momenta solving the triple or double cut on - shell conditions  @xcite , as described by ita  @xcite .",
    "these two articles also review methods for computing the rational parts of one - loop amplitudes .",
    "although the rational parts have no unitarity cuts in four dimensions ( by definition ) , they can be constructed via their cuts in dimensional regularization in @xmath22 dimensions .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to construct them recursively in the number of legs  @xcite .    on - shell loop amplitudes in massless non - abelian",
    "gauge theories always contain infrared divergences , due to the exchange of soft gluons or virtual collinear splittings . in qcd",
    "it is conventional to regulate these divergences , as well as the ultraviolet ones , using dimensional regularization . in supersymmetric theories , dimensional reduction  @xcite , or the related four - dimensional helicity scheme  @xcite ,",
    "can be used to keep the number of bosonic and fermionic states the same , and preserve ward identities for ordinary supersymmetry .",
    "the general structure of the infrared divergences is well understood from decades of work in qed as well as qcd  @xcite .",
    "it has been worked out in the most detail in the context of dimensional regularization  @xcite .",
    "the basic picture is shown in .",
    "soft divergences and collinear divergences associated with the amplitude @xmath23 each have a universal form .",
    "they can be factorized from each other and from a hard , short - distance part of the amplitude .",
    "soft divergences , denoted by the blob marked @xmath24 , come from exchange of long - wavelength gluons .",
    "these gluons do not have the resolving power to probe the internal structure of the `` jets '' @xmath25 of virtual collinear particles which capture the collinear divergences .",
    "soft gluons can only see the overall color charges of the jets .",
    "an individual jet function @xmath26 depends on the type of particle @xmath27 , but not on the full amplitude kinematics .",
    "the soft function @xmath24 does not depend on the particle types , but only on their momenta and color quantum numbers .",
    "in general these quantum numbers can be mixed by gluon exchange , so @xmath24 is a matrix in color space .",
    "the hard function @xmath28 has no infrared singularities , but generically depends on the particle types , colors and kinematics .",
    "4.5 truein    in the planar or large-@xmath12 limit , the picture simplifies considerably , to that shown in .",
    "now @xmath23 represents the coefficient of a particular color structure , such as @xmath29 ( assuming that all external states are in the adjoint representation ; see ) . in the planar limit",
    ", individual soft gluons can only connect color - adjacent external partons .",
    "there is no mixing of different color structures at large @xmath12 .",
    "one can absorb the entire soft function @xmath24 into jet functions , which corresponds to breaking up the right - hand side of into @xmath14 wedges .",
    "each wedge is bounded by two hard lines , and is composed of `` half '' of each of the two jet functions , as well as the soft gluons exchanged between them . up to nonsingular terms",
    ", the wedge controlling the infrared divergences represents the square root of the sudakov form factor , which is defined as the amplitude for a color - singlet state to decay into a pair of ( adjoint ) gluons .",
    "4.5 truein    in dimensional regularization , the sudakov form factor obeys a particular differential equation  @xcite , whose source term is called the cusp anomalous dimension @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "there is an additional constant of integration , called @xmath31 .",
    "these two functions ( along with the @xmath6 function in a non - conformal theory ) control the infrared divergences to all orders for any amplitude in a planar massless gauge theory . in planar",
    "@xmath0 sym , the cusp anomalous dimension has been determined to all orders in the coupling using integrability  @xcite .",
    "the bds ansatz  @xcite was built up from this description of the infrared singularities of planar amplitudes , plus the observation for the two- and three - loop four - point amplitudes that the hard function @xmath28 essentially reduces to a constant , independent of the kinematics .",
    "besides the cusp anomalous dimension , another place that integrability certainly enters multi - loop scattering amplitudes is in multi - regge - kinematics , a particular class of high - energy or small - angle limits of @xmath32 particle scatterings .",
    "these kinematics gave the first indication that the bds ansatz for mhv amplitudes has to be corrected beginning at the six - point level  @xcite .",
    "( it was previously argued  @xcite using the properties of wilson loops , that the ansatz should be corrected at two loops for a large value of @xmath14 , unless the correspondence between mhv amplitudes and wilson loops were to break down .",
    "the hexagon wilson loop was then computed and found to differ from the ansatz prediction  @xcite . )",
    "the dynamics of gluons in the transverse plane is given , in the leading - logarithmic approximation , by the hamiltonian for a integrable open spin chain , as reviewed here by bartels , lipatov and prygarin  @xcite .",
    "in planar @xmath0 sym , another infrared regulator is more convenient for many purposes , in particular for exploring the loop - level consequences of dual conformal symmetry , which is not preserved by dimensional regularization .",
    "the features of a recently - developed `` higgs regulator ''  @xcite are reviewed in this issue by henn  @xcite .",
    "for this regulator , vacuum expectation values are given to some of the adjoint scalar fields in the theory , breaking the gauge symmetry in such a way that ( in the planar limit ) the amplitudes are regulated by massive particles circulating around the outside of the loop diagrams .",
    "dual conformal symmetry remains exact in a certain sense .",
    "when the particle masses @xmath33 are taken to be much less than the momentum - invariants for the scattering process , logarithmic divergences develop , the analogs of the @xmath34 infrared poles in dimensional regularization .",
    "there is a hierarchy of simplicity in the scattering amplitudes for various types of gauge theory , as sketched in .",
    "this hierarchy begins to be revealed at one loop .",
    "the outer region of the diagram stands for a generic gauge theory with massive matter fields , and perhaps massive gauge bosons , if the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken , as in electroweak theory .",
    "one - loop amplitudes in such a theory generically contain tadpole integrals .",
    "one - particle cuts are nontrivial , and are particularly delicate because of external - leg contributions  @xcite .",
    "the cut structure of loop integrals containing massive propagators in the loop is generically somewhat more complicated than the purely massless case .",
    "massive particles in the loop can be unstable , which usually necessitates complex masses . when one enters the `` massless '' ring in , corresponding to massless gauge bosons and matter fields ,",
    "most of these complications vanish , although there are still generically rational parts to compute .",
    "the ring `` sym '' stands for supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "their one - loop amplitudes can be constructed from four - dimensional unitarity cuts alone , _",
    "i.e. _  there are no non - trivial rational parts  @xcite .",
    "5.2 truein    moving further inward in , we arrive at @xmath0 sym .",
    "as mentioned earlier , at one loop the coefficients of bubble and triangle integrals now vanish , as well as the independent rational parts .",
    "( there are other gauge theories with vanishing bubble and triangle coefficients , at least for their @xmath14-gluon amplitudes  @xcite . )",
    "the theory becomes conformally invariant .",
    "it has been conjectured that the _ leading singularities _  the multi - loop analogs of the quadruple cuts  are sufficient to determine the amplitudes at any loop order  @xcite .",
    "in addition , scattering amplitudes have empirically a predictable , uniform transcendental weight  @xcite .",
    "this weight refers to their construction out of polylogarithms , logarithms , and riemann @xmath35 values .",
    "for example , the finite ( @xmath36 ) terms in one - loop @xmath0 sym amplitudes are of weight two : they contain some terms proportional to the polylogarithm @xmath37 , and others which are products of two logarithms , or proportional to @xmath38 , but they do not contain any terms of lower transcendentality .",
    "( at one loop this result just follows from the absence of bubble and tadpole integrals . ) wherever analytic results are available , this uniform transcendentality property holds . for example , at two loops ( weight four for the finite terms ) it holds for the non - planar , subleading - color terms as well as the planar ones  @xcite .",
    "finally , for planar @xmath0 sym , as mentioned earlier , additional symmetries appear , dual superconformal invariance and an associated yangian symmetry .",
    "the extra symmetries are related to integrability .",
    "they give rise to the prospect of adapting methods developed for other integrable systems to determine the @xmath24-matrix exactly , at least in the large @xmath12 limit .",
    "indeed , as reviewed by drummond  @xcite , an integrand exhibiting manifest yangian invariance has been proposed recently  @xcite for the general @xmath39-loop @xmath14-point amplitude , based on the bcfw recursion relations ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite .    at the level of integrated amplitudes ,",
    "dual conformal invariance has an anomaly due to the need for an infrared regulator .",
    "the anomaly was first understood in terms of wilson loops rather than amplitudes  @xcite ( for which divergences are ultraviolet in nature , rather than infrared ) .",
    "nevertheless , dual conformal symmetry completely fixes the form of the four- and five - point amplitudes .",
    "the form to which they are fixed turns out to be precisely the abdk / bds ansatz  @xcite , which was developed earlier based on the structure of infrared divergences of amplitudes , plus patterns observed at two and three loops . as discussed in , for six external legs one can build three different combinations of kinematic variables that are invariant under all dual conformal transformations , the cross - ratios @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "at the six - point level , the abdk / bds ansatz fails at the first nontrivial order , two loops  @xcite , and dual conformal symmetry allows for an additional `` remainder function '' , @xmath43 , which depends on the three cross - ratios .    at strong coupling ,",
    "large @xmath44 and large-@xmath12 , alday and maldacena used the ads / cft correspondence to map the problem of gluon scattering to that of strings moving in anti - de - sitter space  @xcite .",
    "the ads background is weakly curved in this limit , relative to the string scale .",
    "another way of saying this is that the two - dimensional string world - sheet stretches over a large area , relative to the scale on which strings fluctuate , allowing a semi - classical expansion to be used at large @xmath44 . in the leading term in the expansion",
    ", different helicity configurations are not distinguished .",
    "the amplitude is given simply by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the classical action that minimizes the area ( at least for scattering configurations with a euclidean interpretation ) .",
    "using a @xmath47-duality transformation in string theory , alday and maldacena showed that the boundary conditions for the world - sheet are closed polygons , where each edge is a light - like segment given by the momentum @xmath48 of the @xmath49 gluon .",
    "the solution to the minimal area problem was found explicitly for four - gluon scattering .",
    "more recently , in order to handle more complicated kinematical configurations than the four - point case , the integrability of the string sigma - model action  @xcite has been exploited .",
    "the minimal area problem has been solved by mapping it to a system of equations identical to those of the thermodynamical bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "the first computation at strong coupling was for the four - gluon amplitude , and matched precisely the prediction of the abdk / bds ansatz  @xcite .",
    "but it also suggested a weak - coupling correspondence between scattering amplitudes and wilson loops for closed light - like polygons , which was rapidly established for a variety of cases , initially for the simplest case of mhv scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the wilson - loop correspondence has been very important both conceptually and technically .",
    "conceptually , it is still not entirely clear why it happens at all at weak coupling .",
    "technically , given its existence , it allows amplitudes to be computed in terms of wilson line integrals , which are generally somewhat more tractable than feynman loop integrals .",
    "some recent conceptual advances have come from considering certain correlation functions with close - to - light - like separations  @xcite .",
    "the relative simplicity of the wilson line integrals for the six - point ( hexagon ) case allowed the remainder function @xmath43 to be evaluated analytically in terms of goncharov polylogarithms  @xcite .",
    "the expression in ref .",
    "@xcite was then simplified considerably , to a few lines involving classical polylogarithms @xmath50 , using properties of the symbol operation which captures all of the essential analytic behavior of a multi - variable function  @xcite .",
    "these results open the door to the possibility of finding simple analytic results for more general kinematic configurations .",
    "for some configurations in which the external momenta are restricted to two space - time dimensions , two - loop analytic results are already available beyond six external legs  @xcite .",
    "there is certainly the prospect of more multi - loop analytic results on the horizon , for both wilson loops and scattering amplitudes in planar @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "gravity seems to be a completely separate force from gauge theory .",
    "it has a spin two force carrier instead of spin one , no color degrees of freedom , and a dimensionful coupling constant .",
    "nevertheless , the two theories are intimately connected .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence",
    "@xcite relates the two , holographically , as a _ weak - strong _ duality .",
    "as mentioned earlier , strong - coupling scattering of gluons has an alternate description in terms of strings moving in a weakly - curved five - dimensional gravitational background . on the other hand ,",
    "there is also a _ weak - weak _ duality of some kind between gravity and gauge theory , directly in four dimensions : it is possible to write perturbative scattering amplitudes for gravitons in terms of `` double copies '' of gluon amplitudes .",
    "the original examples of such relations are due to kawai , lewellen and tye ( klt )  @xcite , who found them by first deriving relations between closed and open string theory tree amplitudes , whose low - energy limits give tree - level relations in field - theory .",
    "graviton amplitudes are represented in terms of sums of products of pairs of gluon amplitudes with different color orderings .",
    "the klt relations hold not only for pure - graviton scattering , in terms of pure - gauge theory , but also for @xmath17 supergravity ( or any subsector of it ) in terms of amplitudes for @xmath0 sym .",
    "more recently it has been recognized that other double - copy formulas exist  @xcite .",
    "the new formulas are simpler in some sense than the klt relations ; they involve the direct squares of gauge - theory components , whereas the klt relations employ multiple permutations of full gauge - theory amplitudes .",
    "as reviewed in this issue by carrasco and johansson  @xcite , these relations , combined with generalized unitarity , have important consequences for multi - loop amplitudes in @xmath17 supergravity , because they map the problem to a much simpler one , the corresponding multi - loop amplitudes for ( non - planar ) @xmath0 sym .    in the next two sections we discuss a few of the basic tools used to organize and illuminate the color and kinematic structure of amplitudes , which underlay the discussions in many of the other articles in this special issue .",
    "in this section we describe some common conventions for organizing the color structure of su@xmath8 gauge theory amplitudes , which are used elsewhere in this special issue .",
    "most of the articles implicitly discuss color - ordered partial amplitudes , which are particularly convenient in the large-@xmath12 limit in which planar diagrams dominate .",
    "color - ordered amplitudes emerge from a `` trace - based '' color decomposition ( as also reviewed in _",
    "e.g. _  refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , in some cases , in particular for describing subleading - color terms in amplitudes , and color - kinematic duality relations  @xcite , decompositions based on the su@xmath8 structure constants are more useful .    in general",
    ", we consider two different su@xmath8 representations for the external states :    * the adjoint representation , for the gluon and any of its superpartners ( _ i.e. _  for all states in @xmath0 sym ) .",
    "adjoint color indices are denoted by @xmath51 . * the fundamental ( defining ) representation @xmath12 , and its conjugate representation @xmath52 , for quarks and anti - quarks respectively .",
    "fundamental color indices are denoted by @xmath53 , and anti - fundamental @xmath52 indices by @xmath54 .",
    "the generators of su@xmath8 in the fundamental representation are traceless hermitian @xmath55 matrices , denoted by @xmath56 .",

    "the group theory ( color ) factors in feynman diagrams are of two types : @xmath56 for the gluon - quark - antiquark vertex , and the su@xmath8 structure constants @xmath59 ( or products of @xmath59 s ) for all other vertices .",
    "( it is also convenient to normalize the structure constants differently , using @xmath60 , where @xmath59 is the standard , textbook normalization . )",

    ", dual conformal invariance can be spoiled by the infrared regulator needed for on - shell amplitudes . a loop - integration measure in four dimensions , @xmath195 ,",
    "transforms under an inversion  ( [ dualinversion ] ) as , @xmath196 . in @xmath197",
    "this factor precisely cancels terms from inverting the associated propagators in graphs such as the one in ( b ) .",
    "however , in dimensional regularization , we have @xmath198 , and the invariance is lost due to extra factors in the transformation of the loop integration measure . as discussed in detail in this issue by henn",
    "@xcite , for planar @xmath0 sym it is possible to retain dual conformal invariance at the loop level by using instead a higgs regulator  @xcite , which generates particle masses that can also be thought of as extra components of the @xmath190 .",
    "although amplitude computations with the higgs regulator have not been pushed quite as far yet as in dimensional regularization , there are certain advantages to this approach .",
    "for example , in dimensional regularization , terms in lower - loop amplitudes that vanish as @xmath199 often have to be computed , because they can multiply pole terms , @xmath200 , in other amplitudes ( or in the squares of amplitudes needed to construct differential cross sections ) .",
    "the article by schabinger in this issue discusses such @xmath201 contributions  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , with the higgs regulator , the singularities have the form of powers of logarithms , @xmath202 , and power - suppressed terms of the form @xmath203 can always be dropped , because they vanish faster than any power of a logarithm .",
    "how constraining is dual conformal symmetry ?",
    "in general it can only determine amplitudes up to arbitrary functions of the cross - ratios , u_ijkl   , [ genu ] because these variables are invariant under the inversion  ( [ dualinversion ] ) .",
    "however , the on - shell constraints @xmath204 imply that there are no non - trivial cross ratios for four- and five - particle scattering . at the six - point level",
    "there are three non - trivial cross ratios , utilizing the allowed @xmath205 and @xmath206 kinematic invariants : [ defu ] -1.8 cm u_1 = = , u_2 = = , u_3 = = . as mentioned earlier , the remainder function @xmath207 characterizing the two - loop mhv six - point amplitude in planar @xmath0 sym is a function of these three variables , and this function is now known analytically in terms of polylogarithms  @xcite .    in planar",
    "@xmath0 sym , dual conformal invariance combines with dual @xmath0 supersymmetry to generate dual superconformal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to consider super - amplitudes , which package sets of amplitudes together by using an @xmath0 on - shell superfield  @xcite , [ super - wave ] -2.3 cm ( ) = g^+ + ^a g_a + ^a ^b _ ab + ^a^b^c _ abcd |g^d + ^a^b^c ^d _ abcd g^- . here",
    "@xmath208 are the @xmath209 helicity gluons , @xmath210 and @xmath211 the four flavors of @xmath212 helicity gluinos , and @xmath213 the six real @xmath214 helicity scalar states",
    ". integrations over the grassmann variables @xmath21 , @xmath215 , can be used to pick off the desired component amplitudes from the super - amplitudes , defined by [ super - amplitude ] a_n(_i )  a ( _ 1(_1 ) ,  , _",
    "just as the @xmath191 bosonic variables automatically satisfy momentum conservation , @xmath216 , one can construct their superpartners @xmath217 , whose differences satisfy _ i^a - _",
    "i+1^a  =  _ i^_i^a , [ dualsuper ] for @xmath69 .",
    "super - momentum conservation constitutes eight constraints : q^a  _ i=1^n _ i^_i^a  =  0 . [ supercons ] like ordinary momentum conservation , it is satisfied by virtue of the periodicity of the dual coordinates , @xmath218 , @xmath219 .",
    "the mhv super - amplitude generalizing is _",
    "n^,mhv = i = i . [ mhvsuper ] it transforms covariantly under dual superconformal transformations  @xcite which extend so(4,2 ) to the superalgebra psu(2,2@xmath2204 ) .",
    "furthermore , the solutions to the bcfw super - recursion relation for amplitudes with more negative helicities ( nmhv , nnmhv , _ etc .",
    "_ ) are given by the product of this super - amplitude with collections of dual superconformal invariants , generically denoted by @xmath221  @xcite .",
    "superconformal and dual superconformal symmetry are separate symmetries , which partly overlap .",
    "they close into a very large symmetry group called the yangian  @xcite , as discussed in this issue by bargheer , beisert and loebbert  @xcite and by drummond  @xcite .",
    "the generic generator of the yangian is not local in the sense of being a sum of single - particle terms ( like @xmath132 and @xmath153 ) ; rather it is a sum of multi - particle operators .",
    "( for the dual superconformal generators , the nonlocality is mild ; only the sum of two - particle operators appears . )",
    "there are certain `` anomalies '' in the action of the yangian on amplitudes . at tree level",
    ", the anomalies only act at the boundary of the @xmath14-particle phase space , where two particles become collinear , as in  @xcite . at loop - level",
    "they act in the full phase - space , due to singularities in the loop integration  @xcite . however , it is possible to deform either the symmetry algebra or the representation in a suitable way so as to preserve the invariance  @xcite",
    ". it will be very interesting to see whether the constraints from the yangian are sufficient to determine multi - loop amplitudes directly , without having to pass through the computation of loop integrals .",
    "another very recent development , in the same vein of using symmetries or dynamical principles to bypass standard loop ( or wilson line ) integrals , concerns polygonal wilson loops .",
    "one considers an operator - product - like expansion for the wilson loop , associated with a limit in which multiple momenta become collinear  @xcite .",
    "this expansion can be carried out at both weak and strong coupling . at weak coupling",
    "it has been used to compute the discontinuity of the integrated two - loop amplitude , directly in terms of one - loop quantities  @xcite .",
    "there has been a remarkable array of breakthroughs in our understanding of scattering amplitudes over the past few years , as described in the review articles in this special issue of journal of physics a. this article has represented an overview of many of these developments , as well as providing some basic material as an introduction to the remaining contributions . however , it certainly did not do justice to all of the directions being pursued currently .",
    "one of the other remarkable features of this field has been the interplay and cross - fertilization between formal developments and phenomenology .",
    "the parke - taylor tree amplitudes were found in the course of trying to understand patterns arising in the structure of five- and six - gluon tree - level amplitudes . a similar analysis of the structure of the five - gluon amplitude at one loop in qcd led to the development of the unitarity method , which has been indispensable for computing high - loop - order amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric gauge theory and gravity , but which has also produced new nlo qcd results for colliders  @xcite .",
    "a `` radiation zero '' found over thirty years ago in the electroweak process @xmath222",
    "@xcite was studied for a general gauge theory soon thereafter  @xcite ; the relations found there were recognized much later as the four - point versions of a more general color - kinematics duality  @xcite .",
    "wilson loops , used to characterize the effects of soft gluons in qcd , also turned out to be in exact correspondence to full mhv amplitudes in planar @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "this special issue should be of interest , not only to experienced practitioners in the field , but also to newcomers who want to get started . as the history of the field shows , new developments can and will come from totally unanticipated angles .",
    "many of the new ideas in the future may well come to physicists whose interest in the remarkable aspects of scattering amplitudes was sparked , at least in part , by reading the articles assembled in this special issue .",
