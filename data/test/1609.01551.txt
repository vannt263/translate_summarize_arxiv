    "firstly , especially in @xmath0-electron systems , the indirect long - range ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction renders the description by nearest and next - nearest neighbor exchange not in general sufficient . in @xmath1-electron systems partial frustration is found in a few materials where one part of the magnetic moments forms long - range order , the other part remains disordered down to lowest temperature .",

    "such a behavior is in marked contrast to usual magnetically ordered systems with true long - range order at lowest temperatures .",

    "a possible origin of this behavior are the magnetically frustrated moments in cepdal .",
