    "the use of different qd systems with a larger valence band offset and a larger heavy - hole / light - hole splitting @xcite should significantly slow down the mn - hole spin dynamics .",
    "using resonant pl of the positively charged exciton , we have identified an efficient spin relaxation channel for the hybrid mn - hole spin in a qd .",
    "a modelling confirms that mn - hole flip - flops in a nanosecond timescale are induced by an interplay of mn - hole exchange interaction and the lattice deformation of acoustic phonons .",
    "these flip - flops are responsible for the large pl intensity observed under resonant excitation of the @xmath0 systems present in positively charged mn - doped qds .",
    "we showed that jumps out of an optically excited @xmath0 system are possible .",
    "these leaks induce a large bunching of the resonant pl and are at the origin of the optical pumping of the mn - hole spin observed under circularly polarized resonant excitation .",
    "escape out of the excited @xmath0 system can be enhanced by a transverse magnetic field which mixes electron - mn states in the excited state of the charged qd .",
    "the fast mn - hole spin dynamics revealed by these experiments make difficult the practical use of this hybrid spin for quantum information devices . however , the use of a different qd systems with a better hole confinement and a larger heavy - hole / light - hole splitting would significantly reduce the influence of valence band mixing on the mn - hole spin relaxation and limit the interaction of the hybrid mn - hole spin with acoustic phonons .",
    "this work was realized in the framework of the commissariat  lenergie atomique et aux energies alternatives ( institut nanosciences et cryognie ) / centre national de la recherche scientifique ( institut nel ) joint research team nanophysique et semi - conducteurs .",
    "the mechanism of mn - hole flip - flop that we identified and modelled in the case of positively charged magnetic qds can also be directly observed in the resonant pl of neutral qds .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figappendix ] which presents the pl of the exciton in a qd where all the dark exciton states ( @xmath118 ) are well separated from the bright exciton states ( @xmath119 ) and can be observed at zero magnetic field on the low energy side of the spectra .",
    "( plain line ) and dark @xmath120 ( dotted line ) exciton energy levels calculated with @xmath26=-0.03 mev , @xmath121=0.12 mev , @xmath122 , @xmath30=10 @xmath11ev and an electron - hole exchange interaction @xmath123=-0.78 mev .",
    "see for instance reference 32 for a description of the model.,width=316 ]    in the pl excitation experiments presented in fig .",
    "[ figappendix ] , the detection window is set on the dark states while a circularly cross - polarized laser is scanned on the three high energy levels of the bright exciton .",
    "three successive resonances are observed .",
    "( 1 ) : an excitation on @xmath124 produces the dominant pl on a dark states associated with a mn spin state @xmath125 . as",
    "a mn spin flip by two units is unlikely , we then attribute this pl to @xmath126 .",
    "the transfer between these states involves a mn - hole flip - flop .",
    "the second weaker contribution comes from the state @xmath127 .",
    "it corresponds to a transfer conserving the mn spin and involving a spin flip of the electron .",
    "( 2 ) : an excitation on @xmath128 produces the dominant pl on a dark states associated with a mn spin state @xmath129 . as discussed above , a mn spin flip by four units",
    "is unlikely , we then attribute this pl to @xmath130 .",
    "the transfer involve a mn - hole flip - flop .",
    "the second contribution comes from the state @xmath131 .",
    "it corresponds to a conservation of the mn spin and a spin flip of the electron .",
    "( 3 ) : from an excitation on @xmath132 , the dominant pl comes from the state @xmath133 .",
    "it corresponds to a transfer with conservation of the mn spin and a spin flip of the electron .",
    "a pl is also observed from @xmath130 after a spin flip of the hole and from @xmath131 .",
    "the latter transfer involves an electron - mn flip - flop .",
    "let s note that in the state @xmath132 a mn - hole flip - flop is forbidden ( parallel hole and mn spin ) .    if we resume the observed resonances in this neutral qd , we can distinguish two types of spin transfer which can occur within the lifetime of the exciton ( typically 300ps ) : first an efficient transfer from a bright to a dark state involving a mn - hole flip - flop which produces a change of one unit of the mn spin state . secondly , a weaker transfer from a bright to a dark state involving a carrier spin - flip with conservation of the mn spin .",
