    "a 2.3-liter two - phase ( liquid and gas ) argon drift chamber  @xcite was developed and built by the warp collaboration as a prototype detector for wimp dark matter searches with argon as a target  @xcite .",
    "the detector was operated for more than two years by the warp collaboration at laboratori nazionali del gran sasso , italy , at a depth of 3,400 m w.e .",
    "one important by - product of the operation of the prototype warp detector was the precise determination of the @xmath0ar specific activity in natural argon .",
    "+ @xmath0ar and @xmath3kr are two radioactive nuclides whose activity in the atmosphere is of the order of 10mbq / m@xmath4 and 1bq / m@xmath5 , respectively  @xcite . as a result of the liquid argon production process , they are both present in abundant quantities and are the two most significant radioactive contaminations in liquid argon . the two isotopes decay primarily by @xmath6 emission , and their presence can limit the sensitivity of experiments looking for low energy rare events ( wimp dark matter interactions , neutrinoless double beta decay ) using liquid argon either as a target or as a shielding material .",
    "+ @xmath3kr is not a pure @xmath6 emitter , owing to the presence of a 0.43% branching ratio for decay with @xmath6 emission on a metastable state of @xmath3rb , which then decays by emitting a @xmath7-ray of energy 514  kev , with a half - life of 1.01@xmath8s  @xcite .",
    "the coincidence between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 emitted in a fraction of the @xmath3kr decays may ease in some cases the task of determining experimentally the activity of @xmath3kr in low - background detectors .",
    "the determination of the specific activity of @xmath0ar is intrinsically more challenging and not as widely discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "a theoretical estimate is presented in ref .",
    "+ in the last twenty years liquid argon technology has acquired great relevance for astroparticle physics applications .",
    "several experimental techniques , employing liquid argon as sensitive medium , have been proposed especially for rare events detection  @xcite . for wimp",
    "dark matter direct detection , the discrimination of nuclear recoils from the @xmath6-@xmath7 induced background plays a crucial role . the discrimination provided by the experimental technique must be sufficient to reduce the radioactive background below the very low interaction rates foreseeable for wimp dark matter .",
    "a precise determination of the intrinsic specific activity of @xmath0ar is therefore of significant interest for the design of wimp dark matter detectors employing argon as a target .",
    "the detector consists of a two - phase argon drift chamber with argon as a target .",
    "two - phase argon drift chamber was first introduced within the icarus program  @xcite in the framework of a wide - range study of the properties of noble gases .",
    "+ the drift chamber ( see figure  [ fig : warp25 ] ) is operated at the argon boiling point ( 86.7k ) at the atmospheric pressure of the gran sasso laboratory ( about 950 mbar )  @xcite .",
    "the cooling is provided by a thermal bath of liquid argon , contained in an open stainless steel dewar , in which the chamber is fully immersed .",
    "the pressure of the gas phase on the top of the chamber is naturally equalized to the surrounding atmospheric pressure .",
    "+    ionizing events inside the liquid argon volume produce scintillation vuv light mainly at 128 nm .",
    "the scintillation light is shifted to wavelengths in the blue by an organic wavelength shifter ( tetraphenilbutadiene ) covering the walls , and collected by photomultipler tubes ( pmts ) located in the gas phase and facing the liquid volume below .",
    "the 2-inch pmts are manufactured by electron tubes ltd ( model d757ufla ) and have a special photocathode that ensures functionality down to liquid argon temperatures .",
    "the quantum efficiency at the emission wavelength of tpb is about 18% .",
    "the material of the pmts has been selected for high radiopurity : according to the supplier s specifications , the total @xmath7 activity above 100  kev is 0.2  bq / pmt , dominated by the @xmath9th and @xmath10u chains . + a series of field - shaping rings surrounding the liquid phase superimpose an electric field of 1kv / cm .",
    "the electrons are drifted toward the anode ( located atop the chamber ) and then extracted from the liquid to the gaseous phase by a local extraction field provided by a couple of grids .",
    "the electrons are linearly multiplied in the gas phase by a second , stronger local field .",
    "the pmts detect the primary scintillation light ( directly produced by the ionizing event ) and also the secondary scintillation light ( produced by the electron multiplication process in the gas phase ) .",
    "the pmt signals are summed and sent to a multi - channel analyzer recording the pulse height spectrum .",
    "the liquid argon contained in the chamber is argon 6.0 supplied by rivoira s.p.a .",
    "the liquid argon is successively purified from electronegative impurities down to an equivalent contamination of less than 0.1ppb of o@xmath11 by using the chemical filter hopkalit  from air liquid .",
    "the purity from electronegative elements is actively maintained by means of continuous argon recirculation through the chemical filter .",
    "+ the experimental set - up is located in the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso underground laboratory ( 3,400 m w.e . of rock coverage ) .",
    "the flux of cosmic ray muons is suppressed by a factor of @xmath12 with respect to the surface ( residual flux 1.1@xmath8/(m@xmath13  h ) , average muon energy @xmath14gev",
    "the detector is shielded by 10 cm of lead , to reduce the external @xmath7 background .",
    "+ the sensitive volume of the detector has the shape of frustum of cone and it is delimited by a stainless - steel cathode . the sensitive volume for the configuration under analysis is 1.86@xmath10.07liter . the density of liquid argon in the operating conditions ( 950 mbar and 86.7k ) is1.399 g / cm@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the sensitive volume is viewed by seven pmts , whose responses have been equalized in gain .",
    "daily calibrations ensure the long - term stability and the linearity of the response .",
    "the sensitive volume and the argon thermal bath are contained in a stainless steel dewar , 50  cm internal diameter and 200  cm internal height .",
    "for the measurements described in this work , the electric fields were switched off and the chamber was operated as a pure scintillation detector .",
    "the gain of the pmts has been set up to optimize the data acquisition in the typical energy range of the environmental @xmath7-ray background , namely up to 3  mev .",
    "the energy threshold for data acquisition is about 40  kev .",
    "the threshold used for analysis is 100  kev , in order to exclude events from electronic noise .",
    "the response of the detector to @xmath7 radiation was studied using different @xmath7-ray sources ( @xmath16co , @xmath17co , @xmath18cs ) placed outside the chamber .",
    "the spectra obtained with the @xmath16co and @xmath18cs sources are shown in figure  [ fig : sources ] .",
    "typical values of the resolution observed with the calibration sources are @xmath19 at 122  kev ( @xmath16co ) and @xmath20 at 662  kev ( @xmath18cs ) .",
    "the correlation between energy and primary scintillation light detected was linear within the range tested with our sources .",
    "the energy resolution of the detector can be described empirically by the following parametrization : @xmath21 where @xmath22  kev , @xmath23  kev and @xmath24 .",
    "the three terms take into account the effects from non - uniform light collection ( @xmath25 term ) , statistical fluctuations in the light production ( @xmath26 term ) and electronic noise ( @xmath27 term ) .",
    "+    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      +    the systematic uncertainties are summarized in table  [ table:2 ] .",
    "the dominating item is related to the energy calibration of the detector response : since the discrimination between @xmath0ar and @xmath3kr is based upon the @xmath6 end - points , the fit result is sensitive to the energy calibration and resolution .",
    "the uncertainty on the energy calibration in the range of interest was evaluated to be 2% ( @xmath28 ) from the meaurements with the @xmath7-ray sources ; the corresponding @xmath0ar systematic error is 6.5% .",
    "the second important contribution is related to the uncertainty in the active volume of the chamber .",
    "the filling level can be determined with accuracy of about 1 mm , and the diameter of the teflon container with the reflector fixed on it is known with a precision of about 2  mm .",
    "this corresponds to an uncertainty on the sensitive mass of 3.8% .",
    "the best estimate of the @xmath0ar specific activity in the liquid argon is @xmath29 bq / liter , or @xmath30 bq / kg of natural ar , or @xmath31 g(@xmath0ar)/g(@xmath2ar ) .",
    "the value is consistent with the previous determination by h.  loosli  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in our measurement is mainly due to systematics .",
    "+ the liquid argon sample under investigation shows a contamination of @xmath3kr , 0.16@xmath10.13 bq / liter ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we wish to dedicate this work to the memory of our friend and colleague nicola ferrari , co - author of the paper , who prematurely passed away on july , 2006 .",
