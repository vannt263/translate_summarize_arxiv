    "the statistical mechanics of two polymers with constraints on their winding angle has been extensively studied in order to understand the behavior of physical polymer systems , like for instance biological macromolecules of dna @xcite or liquid crystals composed of stacks of disk - shaped molecules @xcite , see refs .",
    "a detailed review on the subject , together with interesting proposals of how to include in the treatment of topologically entangled polymer link invariants which are more sophisticated than the winding number , can be found in @xcite . up to now , however , despite many efforts , mainly ideal polymer chains or loops winding around each others have been considered , while the repulsive interactions between the monomers have been treated approximatively or exploiting in a clever way scaling arguments integrated by numerical simulations , as for instance in @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate ourselves on the case of two directed polymers interacting via a repulsive dirac @xmath0function potential @xcite .",
    "we are particularly interested in the average degree of entanglement of the system , which we wish to estimate by computing the square average winding angle of the two polymers .",
    "this quantity is also called second moment of the winding angle or simply second moment and is a special example of the topological moments first introduced in ref .  @xcite . to achieve our goals , we develop an approach , which combines quantum mechanical and field theoretical techniques . with respect to previous works , we are able to obtain exact results even if the repulsive interactions are not switched off .    in principle , the average of any observable like the squared winding angle can be derived once the partition function of the system is known , but in our case it turns out that the partition function is simply too complicated to obtain any analytical result .",
    "this happens essentially because the full @xmath0function potential is not a central potential , since it mixes both radial and angular variables .",
    "for this reason , the usual procedure of going to polar coordinates and then solving the differential equation satisfied by the partition function of the entangled polymers with the method of separation of variables @xcite , does no longer produce simple formulas as in the situations in which only central forces are present .    to avoid these difficulties , one possibility is to approximate the @xmath0function potential with some radial potential , like for instance the hard core potential of ref .",
    "however , here we shall adopt a different strategy , based on field theories , which does not require any approximation .",
    "this strategy has been developed in @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) to cope with ideal closed polymers whose trajectories are concatenated .",
    "also such systems are characterized by a non - central potential , which comes out as a consequence of the topological constraints imposed on the trajectories . in the field theoretical formulation of refs .",
    "@xcite the computation of the second moment is reduced to the problem of computing some correlation functions of a field theory .",
    "a bonus is provided by the fact that this computation requires just a finite number of feynman diagrams to be evaluated . in the present case , due to the presence of the @xmath0function potential , the field theory which we obtain",
    "is no longer free as that of refs .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that the theory is still linear and thus it can be exactly solved once its propagator is known . luckily , this propagator may be computed exactly using powerful non - perturbative techniques developed in the context of quantum mechanics to deal with hamiltonian containing @xmath0function potentials , see refs .",
    "basically , starting from the green function of a particle whose dynamics is governed by a given hamiltonian @xmath1 , these techniques provide an algorithm to construct the green function of a particle corresponding to a _ perturbed _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the @xmath0function potential .",
    "one advantage of these methods is that there is a long list of potentials for which the green functions of the unperturbed hamiltonians @xmath4 are known . in this way",
    ", it is easy to generalize our treatment including new interactions , which could be relevant in polymer physics , like for instance the coulomb interaction .",
    "the price to be paid is that the quantum - mechanical algorithm works when the green functions are expressed as functions of the energy instead of the time . in the polymer analogy , assuming that the ends of the polymers are attached to two planar surfaces perpendicular to the @xmath5axis and located at the positions @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the role of time is played by the distance @xmath8 , while the energy corresponds to the chemical potential conjugated @xmath8 . to recover the original dependence on @xmath8",
    ", one needs to calculate an inverse laplace transform of the field propagator with respect to the energy . in general , this is not a simple task .",
    "once the propagator of the linear field theory is known , the correlation functions which enter in the expression of the second moment may be calculated contracting the fields in all possible ways using the wick prescription . at the end",
    ", we get in this way an exact formula of the second moment as a function of the _ energy _ , which , we remember , has here the meaning of the chemical potential conjugated to the distance @xmath8 . in the @xmath8 space , due to the problems of computing the inverse laplace transform of the propagator mentioned above , only an approximated expression of the second moment",
    "will be given in the limit of large values of @xmath8 and assuming that the strength of the @xmath0function potential is weak enough to allow a perturbative approach .",
    "our results allow both a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the way in which the repulsive interactions affect the entanglement of two directed polymers .",
    "the corrections introduced by these interactions in the expression of the second moment of ideal polymers have been studied in some interesting limits .",
    "first of all , it has been examined the limit of long polymer trajectories , in which we show that repulsive interaction become particularly relevant .",
    "moreover , we have investigated also the perturbative regime and the strong coupling limit , which is important to recover the excluded volume interactions .",
    "while it is not a problem to take the strong coupling limit within our exact treatment of the repulsive interactions , it turns out that , in this case , the expression of the second moment is particularly complicated from the analytical point of view . for this reason , in the conclusions we will discuss the application of a powerful perturbative method to study field theories at strong coupling due to kleinert @xcite .",
    "finally , the consistency of our results with the previous ones has been checked by studying the limit of ideal polymers .",
    "the material presented in this paper is divided as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the problem of computing the second moment of the winding angle of two directed polymers interacting via a @xmath0function potential is briefly illustrated using the path integral approach .",
    "a constraint on the winding angle is imposed by coupling the trajectories of the polymers with a suitable external magnetic field , following the strategy of previous works like for instance @xcite . in section [ sec : three ] the second moment is expressed in the form of a finite sum of amplitudes of a linear field theory .",
    "these amplitudes may be computed once the propagator of the theory is constructed . in our case ,",
    "the propagator coincides with the green function of a particle diffusing in a @xmath0function potential .",
    "the derivation of this green function in the energy representation using non - perturbative techniques developed in the context of quantum mechanics @xcite is the subject of section [ sec : four ] .",
    "the @xmath0function potential is responsible of the appearance of singularities in the propagator at short distances , which have been regulated here with the introduction of a cut - off .",
    "this procedure is motivated by the fact that in polymer physics there is no point in considering distances which are smaller than the dimensions of a monomer .",
    "a comparison with the more rigorous method of renormalization is made , showing the consistency of the two procedures .",
    "the propagator derived in section  ( [ sec : four ] ) has a particularly nice form , in which the contributions coming from the repulsive forces can be separated from the free part of the propagator , which is related to the random walk of ideal polymers .",
    "this splitting of the propagator is used in section [ sec : five ] to discuss qualitatively and qualitatively the effects of the @xmath0function interactions on the entanglement of the system .",
    "the results of sections [ sec : three ] and [ sec : four ] provide in principle all the ingredients of the second moment .",
    "however , the amplitudes of the linear field theory derived in section  [ sec : three ] should still be evaluated . in this task one",
    "encounters the typical problems occurring in the evaluation of the analytical expressions of feynman diagrams . in the case of the second moment",
    "there are just tree diagrams , but still one has to perform complicated integrations over the spatial coordinates which are transverse to the @xmath5axis . even assuming that polymers are ideal",
    ", the analytical evaluation of these integrations requires drastic approximations , see for instance @xcite . to avoid these difficulties",
    ", we average the second moment with respect to the positions of the endpoints of the two polymers .",
    "this averaged version of the second moment can be computed without any approximation in the energy representation .",
    "this is done in section [ sec : six ] .",
    "the expression of the averaged second moment in the @xmath9space is provided instead only at the first perturbative order in the strength of the repulsive potential and assuming additionally that the value of @xmath8 is large .",
    "we give also an exact formula of the second moment without performing any averaging procedure as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "this formula is however explicit only up to the calculation of the inverse laplace transform of the propagator derived in section [ sec : four ] . in section [ sec : seven ] we consider the situation in which the polymers are not interacting in order to allow the comparison with previous results .",
    "finally , the discussion of the obtained results and ideas for further developments are presented in the conclusions .",
    "our starting point is the action of two directed polymers @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath12 \\label{actnorm}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the potential : @xmath14 the sign of @xmath15 has been chosen in such a way that the interaction associated to the potential @xmath16 is repulsive .",

    "this is equivalent to an average over the positions of the endpoints @xmath59 at the instants @xmath37 and @xmath38 , because the coordinates of the center of mass have been factored out from the partition function and thus they do not play any role .",

    "hairpins are important in nematic solvents @xcite and can be included with the help of field theories @xcite .",
    "we note also that in our formalism it is also possible to study the entanglement of polymers in confined geometries .",
    "for example , values of @xmath71 which are near to @xmath383 ( @xmath384 ) correspond roughly speaking to the situation in which polymers fluctuate in a quasi two - dimensional environment , in which the height in the @xmath35direction is of the order of a few molecular sizes .    finally , an open problem , which has not be discussed here because we were mainly interested in the second moment . is the derivation of the full partition function @xmath64 of eq .",
    "( [ laplrep ] ) . as anticipated in the introduction , it is not an easy task to compute @xmath64 because the repulsive potential of eq .",
    "( [ dirpot ] ) is not central .",
    "we note however that the expression of @xmath64 coincides with the green function of a spin @xmath385 aharonov - bohm problem in the imaginary time formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "this green function has been already derived in @xcite using sophisticated techniques developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which bypass all the difficulties of dealing with a non - central potential .",
    "thus , in principle , the expression of the partition function @xmath64 is known .",
    "unfortunately , some of the consistency conditions imposed on the parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite seem to be incompatible with the requirements of our physical problem , as noted in section [ sec : three ] .",
    "for these reasons , the computation of the full partition function @xmath64 is still a problem which needs further investigations .",
    "luckily , the knowledge of the partition function is not necessary if one is interested to study the excluded volume interactions , which arise in the strong coupling limit .",
    "in fact , in this case it is possible to apply a powerful method due to kleinert @xcite .",
    "this method turns the weak coupling expansion into a strong coupling expansion which is convergent for large values of @xmath15 and is able to accommodate also the anomalous dimensions of quantum field theories .",
    "the convergence of this strong coupling expansion is mostly very fast , so that only a few coefficients of the weak coupling expansion must be known , see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "these coefficients can be easily computed starting from the well known partition function of the aharonov - bohm problem without the insertion of the @xmath0function potential @xcite and treating this potential as a small perturbation assuming that the value of @xmath15 is small .",
    "the application of kleinert s method in order to complete the brief analysis of the strong coupling limit made in this paper is work in progress .",
