    "mesoscopic brownian particles in colloidal suspensions , with typical particle diameters between a few nanometers and a few micrometers , exert forces on each other that depend on the microscopic position and velocity variables of many molecules in the suspending solvent . on coarse - grained length and time scales where the solvent microstructure and dynamics are not resolved , the solvent molecule s degrees of freedom can be ` integrated out ' and one is left with colloidal particles that interact via _ effective _ forces .",
    "these effective forces depend on the thermodynamic state of the solvent .",
    "the tunability of the effective interactions between colloidal particles makes colloidal suspensions ideal model systems for studying classical many - body behavior such as crystallization @xcite , melting @xcite , phase separation @xcite as well as glass and gel formation @xcite . in thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "the effective interactions fulfill newton s third law _ actio = reactio_. that is : the effective force generated by a particle and acting on a second particle is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction , when compared to the force generated by the second particle , acting on the first particle @xcite .",
    "however , the _ actio = reactio _ principle can be broken in a nonequilibrium situation .",
    "nonreciprocity occurs in a multitude of systems . naming a few examples",
    "only , nonreciprocity can arise from nonequilibrium fluctuations @xcite and also in case of diffusiophoretic forces  @xcite , optical forces @xcite , out - of - equilibrium depletion interactions @xcite , hydrodynamic interactions @xcite , and ` social forces ' in pedestrian dynamics modeling @xcite .",
    "nonreciprocal effective interactions are typically superimposed by the classical reciprocal interactions , stemming from electric charges or dipole moments on the particles , van der waals interactions , excluded volume , or other types of direct interactions .    despite their importance",
    ", the many - body statistics of particles with nonreciprocal interactions have not been studied so far in the context of colloidal suspensions .",
    "this stands in stark contrast to the topic of complex ( dusty ) plasmas @xcite , where nonreciprocal interactions are a familiar feature of anisotropic trailing space - charges in the downstream direction behind charged mesoscopic particles in a flowing plasma .",
    "the phenomenon is known as the plasma wake .",
    "consequences of nonreciprocity have been explored in various studies concerning complex plasmas  @xcite .",
    "the most prominent difference between colloidal suspensions and complex plasmas is that the dynamics of colloidal particles in high - density viscous solvent is completely overdamped while the dust - grain dynamics in complex plasmas typically contain a large inertial contribution .",
    "the binary colloidal model system that we study in this paper is governed by pairwise additive nonreciprocal forces and erratic brownian forces .",
    "like in ref .",
    "@xcite , we characterize the strength of nonreciprocity by a scalar parameter @xmath0 which is the ratio of the nonreciprocal to reciprocal forces .",
    "we focus on the time - averaged pair- and triplet - correlation functions for particle positions , developing a microscopic statistical theory based on the many - body - smoluchowski equation and the kirkwood superposition approximation as a closure [ see eq .  ] .",
    "the theory is successfully tested against our brownian dynamics computer simulations . as a result",
    ", we find that nonreciprocity induces distinct nonequilibrium pair correlations , and we also analyze the triplet correlations and the impact of the kirkwood superposition approximation .",
    "our model system is a generalized variant of a diffusiophoretic particle suspension that has been studied by soto and golestanian @xcite .",
    "consider an equimolar brownian suspension containing two different types , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , of spherically symmetric , catalytic mesoscopic particles .",
    "we denote the time - depended position of particle @xmath3 of type @xmath4 by the row vector @xmath5 .",
    "the suspension contains @xmath6 particles , and we define the super vector @xmath7 as short - hand notation for the positions of all particles . throughout this paper ,",
    "upper indices containing greek or capital roman letters are species indices that should not be confused with exponents .",
    "let each particle of type @xmath1 act as a source of strength @xmath8 , for a chemical substance @xmath9 that consists of small molecules .",
    "likewise , let each particle of type @xmath2 be a source of strength @xmath10 for a low molecular weight chemical substance @xmath11 .",
    "the molecules of substances @xmath9 and @xmath11 undergo diffusive motion in the solvent phase , characterized by the stokes - einstein - sutherland translational diffusion coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "evaporation or chemical decomposition into inert products causes molecules of types @xmath9 and @xmath11 to disappear at constant rates @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the explicitly position- and time - dependent concentration fields of the two chemical substances , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , depend in general also on @xmath18 at all times @xmath19 .",
    "however , we assume that the diffusion coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 are large enough to allow for a separation of time scales : at a coarse - grained time scale , each individual particle traverses a distance that is much smaller than the average distance to the nearest neighboring particle and the particle configuration @xmath20 is therefore practically unchanged . at the same time scale ,",
    "the fast diffusion of @xmath9- and @xmath11-type molecules has already led to steady - state concentration fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 that depend only on the instantaneous particle positions @xmath21 , but not on the history @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "restricting our study to time scales that are longer than the mentioned coarse - grained time scale , and neglecting all direct correlations between the two chemical substances molecules , the concentration fields are governed by the instantaneous diffusion equations@xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the laplace operator with respect to the field point @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the dirac delta function . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we approximate the particles as point - like objects , as reflected by the point sources on the right - hand sides of eqs .   and .",
    "this point - particle approximation is justified if the typical distances between particles are much larger than the particle diameters , which is the case for the systems that we have studied ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] and the relating text in sec .",
    "[ sec : paircorrelation ] ) .    solving the linear screened poisson equations and by standard green s function methods gives the result @xmath27 and an analogous expression for @xmath17 which is obtained after the interchange of indices @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in eq .",

    "nonzero values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to finite values for @xmath33 , which sets our model apart from unscreened chemotatic models with zero evaporation rate and @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "we continue by picking an arbitrary tagged particle @xmath3 of species @xmath1 , and splitting the sum in eq .   into a self - part @xmath35 and a complementary distinct part @xmath36 .",
    "the self - part gives the concentration field @xmath37 of chemical @xmath9 , which is created by the tagged particle around itself , and which is isotropic around @xmath38 .",
    "the anisotropic distinct part @xmath39 is created by the remaining particles of species @xmath1 and , obviously , @xmath40 .",
    "once again , eqs .   and",
    "can be repeated analogously for the chemical species @xmath11 and a tagged particle of species @xmath2 , by interchange of indices @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "this is analogous to the forces among a set of point - like electric charges , _",
    "e.g. _ electrons : the lorentz force on a single electron depends on the positions and velocities of all other electric charges , but it is not affected by the field that the tagged particle creates itself .",
    "our model shares many properties with a system of electric point charges that interact via pairwise additive screened coulomb forces , like charged particles moving in an electrolyte , with electric fields calculated in the debye - hckel approximation . combining eqs .   and - , we can interpret the individual summands that contribute to @xmath49 and @xmath50 as pairwise additive forces @xmath51 , exerted by particle @xmath3 of species @xmath4 on particle @xmath48 of species @xmath52 .",
    "however , a peculiarity of the binary diffusiophoretic particle mixture that sets it qualitatively apart from the ensemble of electric point charges is the action - reaction symmetry breaking : an inequality @xmath53 occurs in the general case and , as in ref .",

    "the hydrodynamic diameters of the particles have to be much smaller than the shortest typical particle distances in the suspension .",
    "particles with sufficiently strong , repulsive yukawa - like interactions virtually never come into close contact , and the characteristic length scale that dominates the correlation functions of such particles in @xmath58-dimensional space is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the particle number density @xcite .",

    "action - reaction symmetry breaking of the diffusiophoretic forces can emerge from various possible asymmetries of transport coefficients related to the diffusiophoretic particles of type @xmath1 and @xmath2 or the chemical species of type @xmath9 and @xmath11 : as easily seen from eqs .  , and",

    "on the coarse - grained time scale at which the langevin equation is valid , an overdamped complex liquid is fully described by the many - body distribution function @xmath78 .",
    "often times one is interested in more accessible quantities like the pair distribution functions @xmath79 , which , for the equimolar suspensions studied here , can be defined in the limit @xmath80 in terms of the following @xmath81-fold integrals over @xmath82 : @xmath83 with @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the suspension volume in case of three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems , or the suspension area in case of two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems .",
