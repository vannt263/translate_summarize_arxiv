    "recently , experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have discovered a new boson with a mass around 125 gev  @xcite , whose properties are roughly consistent with those predicted for the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson .",
    "it is now crucial to determine its properties as accurately as possible .",
    "the higgs boson is dominantly produced by gluon fusion through a top quark loop .",
    "its decay to two photons , @xmath2 , provides a very clean signature for probing higgs properties , including its mass . however , there is also a large continuum background to its detection in this channel .",
    "it is important to study how much the coherent interference between the higgs signal and the background could affect distributions in diphoton observables , and possibly use it to constrain higgs properties .",
    "the interference of the higgs boson with @xmath3 was first studied for an intermediate higgs mass boson  @xcite . for the experimentally relevant case of a light , narrow - width higgs boson , it is fruitful to divide the interference contribution into two parts , proportional to the real and imaginary parts of the higgs boson s breit - wigner propagator , respectively .",
    "the diphoton invariant - mass distribution for the real - part interference is odd around the higgs mass .",
    "it contributes negligibly to the experimentally observed cross section , which is integrated over the narrow lineshape .",
    "the imaginary part interferes constructively or destructively with the signal distribution at the higgs mass . for a light sm higgs boson",
    ", the imaginary part vanishes at leading order in the zero quark mass limit  @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the two - loop @xmath0 amplitude and gives only a few percent suppression of the rate  @xcite .",
    "however , the real part interference is affected by finite detector resolution , which smears the diphoton invariant mass distribution and causes a sizable shift in the apparent higgs mass peak , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and further studied in refs .  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we calculate the dominant next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the interference , and study the dependence of the mass shift on the acceptance cuts .",
    "we further argue that the interference effect , especially the mass shift , can be used to bound experimentally , or possibly even measure , the higgs width fairly directly , for widths well below the experimental mass resolution at the lhc .",
    "such a measurement would complement even more direct measurements of the higgs width at future colliders such as the ilc  @xcite or a muon collider  @xcite , but might be accomplished much earlier .",
    "indirect bounds on the higgs width at the lhc have also been given , based on global analyses of various higgs decay channels  @xcite .",
    "however , in these analyses it is impossible to decouple the higgs width from the couplings without a further assumption , because the higgs signal strength is always given by the product of squared couplings for higgs production and for decay , divided by the higgs total width @xmath4 .",
    "typically the further assumption is that the higgs coupling to electroweak vector bosons does not exceed the sm value .",
    "for example , a recent cms analysis making this assumption obtained a 95% confidence level upper limit on the beyond - sm width of the higgs boson of @xmath5 , corresponding to @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "also , a higgs width dominated by invisible modes can be ruled out by direct search  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate here that the interference effect , because of its different dependence on the higgs width , allows @xmath4 to be constrained independently of assumptions about couplings or new decay modes .",
    "the nlo qcd formulae for higgs production via gluon fusion are well known  @xcite . the sm continuum background for gluon fusion into two photons",
    "is also known at nlo  @xcite .",
    "( as a component of the inclusive diphoton background , @xmath7 , the process @xmath0 technically begins at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , but it is greatly enhanced by the large gluon parton distribution function ( pdf ) at small @xmath8 . ) here we present the dominant nlo corrections to the interference between the higgs signal and background in qcd .",
    "figure  [ interffig ] shows , first , the leading - order ( lo ) contribution to the interference [ denoted by lo ( @xmath9 ) ] of the resonant amplitude @xmath10 with the one - loop continuum @xmath0 amplitude mediated by the five light quark flavors .",
    "we also include the tree - level process @xmath11 , whose interference with @xmath12 [ denoted by lo ( @xmath13 ) ] is at the same order in @xmath14 as the leading @xmath15 interference , although suppressed by the smaller quark pdf .",
    "it was already considered in refs .",
    "the contribution from @xmath16 is numerically tiny  @xcite and we will neglect it .    finally , fig .",
    "[ interffig ] depicts the three types of continuum amplitudes mediated by light quark loops that we include in the dominant nlo corrections [ denoted by nlo ( @xmath17 : the real radiation processes , @xmath18 and @xmath19 at one loop , and the virtual two - loop @xmath0 process .",
    "all these amplitudes are adapted from refs .",
    "the soft and collinear divergences in the real radiation process are handled by dipole subtraction  @xcite .",
    "although the contribution from @xmath11 via a light quark loop is not the complete contribution to this amplitude , it forms a gauge - invariant subset and it is enhanced by a sum over quark flavors , so that it gives a significant contribution to the interference at finite higgs transverse momentum .",

    "the integral of the cross section over the resonance is given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 for signal and interference respectively .",

    "@xcite , we model the experimental resolution by a gaussian distribution . although a definitive study of the apparent mass shift has to be performed by the experimental collaborations , using a complete description of the resolution and the background model , we estimate it as follows : for the distribution in the diphoton invariant mass @xmath36 , the likelihood of obtaining @xmath37 events with @xmath38 is , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the integrated luminosity .",

    "the scale variation of the mass shift at finite @xmath69 is very small , because it is essentially a lo analysis ; the scale variation largely cancels in the ratio between interference and signal that enters the mass shift .",

    "[ dmvspth ] is less reliable than the large @xmath69 portion . in using the @xmath69 dependence of the mass shift to constrain the higgs width ,",

    "in particular , for the product @xmath73 entering the dominant gluon fusion contribution to the @xmath20 yield , we solve the following equation , @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the ratio of the experimental signal strength in @xmath76 to the sm prediction ( @xmath77 ) .",

    "it is indeed proportional to @xmath82 for the widths shown in the figure , up to small corrections .",
    "if new physics somehow reverses the sign of the higgs diphoton amplitude , the interference is constructive and the mass shift is positive .    in principle , one could apply the existing measurements of the higgs mass in the @xmath1 and @xmath20 channels in order to get a first limit on the higgs width from this method . however , there are a few reasons why we do not do this here .",
    "first of all , the current atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite measurements are not very compatible , @xmath83 where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "second , the experimental resolution differs from bin to bin and has non - gaussian tails .",
    "third , the precise background model can influence the apparent mass shift .",

    "the statistical error on @xmath86 will drop to 50  mev or less .",
    "the extrapolation of the systematic error is still somewhat uncertain , but should result in a total error of 100  mev or less  @xcite . from , this corresponds to a bound on the higgs width at 95% c.l .",
    "that is within a factor of 15 of the sm value of 4  mev .",
    "in this letter , we have studied the interference of the sm higgs boson with the lhc diphoton continuum background at nlo in qcd . the mass shift is largely stable for moderate jet veto @xmath60 cuts .",
    "in addition , we provide a slightly more precise prediction for the mass shift at finite higgs @xmath60 , by including the contribution from quark - gluon scattering via quark loops .",
    "the strong @xmath60 dependence of the mass shift may allow its measurement without reference to the @xmath1 channel .",
