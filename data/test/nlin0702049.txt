    "an idealized model of a resonant bragg grating often considers a linear homogeneous dielectric host medium containing an array of thin films with resonant atoms or molecules .",
    "the thickness of each film is much less than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave propagating through such a structure .",
    "the dynamics of ultrashort light pulses in the gratings containing films embedded with two - level atoms of the grating has been studied in  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the transition frequencies of atoms are assumed to be near the bragg frequency .",

    "an example of such a material is a dielectric with embedded metallic nanoparticles  @xcite-@xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider ultrashort pulse interaction with bragg structures containing thin films with metallic nanoparticles .",
    "the bragg resonance frequency and carrier wave frequency in our considerations are assumed to be close to the plasmonic resonance frequency of the nanoparticles .",
    "losses in realistic plasmonic oscillations are of considerable importance . here",
    "we consider an idealized case , wherein pulse duration is much shorter than the characteristic time of losses , so that the effects of losses can be neglected . in the limit of the slowly - varying envelope approximation",
    "we derive governing equations for two counter - propagating electromagnetic waves interacting with plasmonic oscillation - induced medium polarization .",
    "this system of equations represents the two - wave maxwell - duffing type model .",

    "deviation from a perfectly spherical shape has a much larger impact on a nanoparticle s resonance frequency than does variation in diameter .",
    "this shape variation causes a broadening of the resonance line .",
    "the broadened spectrum is characterized by a probability density function @xmath15 of deviations @xmath16 from some mean value @xmath17 . when computing the total polarization , all resonance frequencies must be taken into account .",
    "the contributions of the various resonance frequencies are weighted according to the probability density function @xmath15 ; the weighted average is denoted by @xmath18 in equations  ( [ 21.1]),([21.2 ] ) . in what follows",

    "the temporal second derivative terms in equations  ( [ 21.1],[21.2 ] ) can be omitted .",
