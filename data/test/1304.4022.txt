    "the dynamic polarizability of an atom or ion gives a measure of the energy shift of the atom or ion when immersed in an electromagnetic field @xcite . for any given state ,",
    "one can write @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the polarizability of the quantum state at frequency @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a measure of the strength of the ac electromagnetic field .",
    "the value of the dynamic polarizability in the @xmath10 limit is the static dipole polarizability .",
    "the magic wavelength for a transition is the wavelength for which the ac stark shift of the transition energy is zero @xcite .",
    "the identification of magic wavelengths and their use in making optical lattices has resulted in the development of optical lattice clocks which have the potential to exceed the performance characteristics of the existing standard for time , namely the cesium microwave clock @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental determination of magic wavelengths also provides valuable information to constrain the atomic structure models that are used to estimate the impact of stark shifts on the performance on atomic and ion clocks @xcite .",
    "a parameter related to the magic wavelength is the tune - out wavelength .",
    "the tune - out wavelengths for an atomic state are the wavelengths at which the polarizability for that state goes to zero @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that most atomic states have a number of tune - out wavelengths just like most atomic transitions have a variety of magic wavelengths .",
    "the advantage of magic and tune - out wavelength measurements are that they are effectively null experiments .",
    "they measure the frequencies at which polarizability related quantities are equal to zero .",
    "therefore they do not rely on a precise determination of the strength of a static electric field or the intensity of a laser field .",
    "this makes it possible to determine the magic wavelengths to a high degree of precision @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of theoretical studies of the properties of the low - lying ca@xmath3 ion @xcite by 3 different research groups .",
    "one of these groups @xcite used a non - relativistic approach while the other two groups used explicitly relativistic formulations @xcite .",
    "one of the singular features about the relativistic calculations are significant differences between predictions of the properties of spin - orbit doublets .",
    "the relativistic all - order many body perturbation theory method predicts relatively small non - geometric differences between the line strengths of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 spin - orbit doublets @xcite .",
    "the relativistic coupled cluster approach typically gives much larger differences  @xcite .",
    "one of the secondary aims of the present work is to shed light on these differences .",
    "the present manuscript reports calculations of the dynamic polarizabilities of the five lowest states of ca@xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian used is a fully relativistic version of a semi - empirical fixed core potential that has been successfully applied to the description of many one and two electron atoms @xcite .",
    "while there are many differences in the technical detail , the underlying philosophy and the effective hamiltonian for the valence electron are essentially the same once the relativistic modifications are taken into account .",
    "magic wavelengths for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 transitions are given .",
    "the dynamic polarizability of the ground ca@xmath3(@xmath0 ) state is dominated by the @xmath15 transitions and its accuracy is largely dependent on the accuracy of the transition matrix elements connecting the @xmath0 and @xmath12 states .",
    "the description of transitions involving the ca@xmath3(@xmath1 ) state is complicated by the effect that the @xmath1 electrons have on the core electrons .",
    "the @xmath1 orbitals have the smallest @xmath16 expectation values of any of the valence electrons and this does distort the wavefunctions for the outermost core electrons @xcite .",
    "one consequence of this are greater uncertainties in the calculation of transition matrix elements involving the @xmath11 states @xcite    all results reported in this paper are given in atomic units with the exception of the lifetimes which are given in seconds .",
    "the value adopted for the speed of light is @xmath17 a.u .",
    "the calculation methodology is as follows .",
    "the first step involves a dirac - fock ( df ) calculation of the ca@xmath18 ground state .",
    "the df calculation begins with the equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the single - electron dirac hamiltonian @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the speed of light , @xmath23 is the momentum operator , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the dirac matrices  @xcite .    the orbitals of the df wave function , @xmath26 , can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the large and small components , @xmath30 and @xmath31 correspond to the angular components . the radial dirac equation for an orbital can be expressed schematically as    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is called the dirac - fock potential , and @xmath34 is the interaction potential between the electron and the nucleus .",
    "a fermi nuclear distribution approximation is usually adopted for many - electron atomic system .",
    "the single particle orbitals are written as linear combinations of analytic basis functions and so the method of roothaan @xcite is used to recast the df equations into a set of matrix equations .",
    "the functions chosen are b - splines with notre - dame boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the large and small components are expanded in terms of a b - spline basis of @xmath35 order defined on the finite cavity @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 @xmath38 the finite cavity is set as a knots sequence , @xmath39 , satisfying an exponential distribution @xcite .",
    "the specifics of the grid were that @xmath40 @xmath41 and 50 b - splines of order @xmath42 were used to represent the single particle states .",
    "using the galerkin method and mit - bag - model boundary conditions  @xcite , the df equations were solve by iteration until self - consistency was achieved .",
    "the single - electron orbital ( koopmans ) energies of the closed shell ca@xmath18 ion agreed with those computed with the grasp92 program @xcite to better than 10@xmath43 a.u .",
    ".[tab1 ] theoretical and experimental energy levels ( in hartree ) for some of the low - lying states of ca@xmath3 .",
    "the energies are given relative to the energy of the ca@xmath18 core .",
    "the experimental data were taken from the nist tabulation @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     the dynamic polarizabilities of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 states of ca@xmath3 are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "these figures assume non - polarized light .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] only has two magic wavelengths below @xmath46 a.u .",
    "transitions to the @xmath47 states make no contribution to the @xmath45 state polarizability .",
    "this is evident from table [ d2 ] which details the breakdown of different transitions to the polarizability . the magic wavelength at 395.775 nm for the @xmath48 magnetic sub - level can give an estimate of the contribution to the @xmath49 polarizability arising from excitations to the @xmath50 levels .",
    "the @xmath44 and @xmath51 polarizabilities are shown in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "the @xmath52 polarizabilities are shown for all magnetic sub - levels and also for the average polarizability .",
    "magic wavelengths occur when the photon energy gets close to the excitation energies for the @xmath53 transitions and the @xmath54 transitions .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath44 and @xmath51 polarizabilities at photon energies between 0.02 and 0.07 a.u .",
    "precise values of the magic wavelengths and the breakdown of the polarizability into different components can be found in table [ d3 ] .",
    "two of the magnetic sub - levels have magic wavelengths at infrared frequencies , namely @xmath55 and 1074.336 nm .",
    "the contributions to the in @xmath51 polarizability are dominated by the @xmath56 transition which constitutes about 88@xmath57 of the polarizability .",
    "the measurement of these magic wavelengths provides a method to determine the @xmath58 to @xmath59 oscillator strength ratios .",
    "suppose all the remaining components of the @xmath51 polarizability can only be estimated to an accuracy of 10@xmath57 .",
    "the overall net uncertainty in the remaining terms would be less than 1.5@xmath57 .",
    "there are also an additional magic wavelengths that can potentially be measured .",
    "the @xmath0 dynamic polarizability goes through zero as the wavelength passes through energies needed to excite the @xmath60 and @xmath61 transitions .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the polarizabilities for the @xmath0 and @xmath51 at energies near the @xmath62 excitation energies .",
    "the @xmath51 polarizabilities are typically small in magnitude in this wavelength range .",
    "the magic wavelength arises more from the the cancellation of the @xmath63 and @xmath45 contributions to the @xmath0 dynamic polarizability than from the cancellation between the @xmath0 and @xmath51 dynamic polarizabilities .",
    "measurement of the magic wavelength here is in some respects in analogous to a measurement of the longest tune - out wavelength for neutral potassium @xcite .",
    "zero field shift wavelengths measured in the spin - orbit energy gap of the resonant transition are strongly dominated by the large and opposite polarizability contributions of the two members of the spin - orbit doublet @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to accurately determine the oscillator strength ratio , i.e. @xmath64:@xmath65 , of the two transitions comprising the spin - orbit doublet .",
    "table [ d4 ] identifies the magic wavelengths associated with the @xmath66 energy interval .",
    "the situation here is similar to the situation for the @xmath67 magic wavelengths .",
    "however , there are three magic wavelengths in the infrared region of the spectrum .",
    "this transition has an additional magic wavelength since the @xmath68 state , unlike the @xmath69 state , also undergoes undergoes a transition to the @xmath63 state .",
    "the polarizability difference in the 0.02 to 0.07 a.u .",
    "energy range is plotted in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the @xmath70 polarizability is dominated by the @xmath71 transition and a magic wavelength measurement can be used to make an estimate of the @xmath71 line strength relative to the @xmath0 dynamic polarizability .",
    "the @xmath68 polarizability at 850.335 nm has large contributions from the @xmath63 and @xmath45 states since it lies between the excitation energies of these of states .",
    "measurement of the 850.335 nm and 1308.590 nm wavelengths together would give estimates of the @xmath72 line strengths and the @xmath73:@xmath74 ratio .",
    "a measurement of the magic wavelengths in the vicinity 395 nm provides would permit a determination of the @xmath64:@xmath65 ratio .",
    "an uncertainty analysis has been done for all the magic wavelengths presented in the preceding sections .",
    "this analysis was aimed at making an initial estimate of how uncertainties in the matrix elements of the most important transitions would translate to a shift in the magic wavelengths .",
    "the primary purpose of the uncertainty analysis is to define reasonable limits to help guide an experimental search for the magic wavelengths identified in this paper .    in the case of the @xmath75 polarizability differences ,",
    "the @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 matrix elements were all changed by @xmath79 and the magic wavelengths recomputed .",
    "the matrix elements involving the different spin - orbit states of the same multiplet were all given the same scaling .",
    "a variation of @xmath80 was chosen by reference to the difference of the dfcp matrix elements with the experimental or the mbpt - sd matrix elements .",
    "the estimate of a @xmath79 uncertainty in the @xmath15 matrix element can be regarded as a conservative estimate .",
    "the @xmath81 polarizability difference is predominantly determined by the @xmath15 and @xmath82 matrix elements .",
    "so variations of @xmath80 in these two transitions were used in determining the uncertainties in the magic wavelengths .",
    "there are a number of magic wavelengths which are relatively insensitive to changes in the matrix elements of a multiplet .",
    "one of these wavelengths is the 850 nm wavelength for the @xmath83 interval and the others are the magic wavelengths near 395 nm .",
    "these wavelengths arise due to cancellations in the polarizabilities due to two transitions of a spin - orbit doublet . in the case of the 850 nm magic wavelength ,",
    "the relevant transitions are the @xmath84 transitions .",
    "the sensitivity of the magic wavelengths near 395 nm to changes in the transition matrix elements depends on the overall size of the polarizabilities of the @xmath12 and @xmath11 levels .",
    "when these are large due to transitions other than the @xmath15 transition , then the 395 nm magic wavelength shows higher sensitivity to the changes in the matrix elements .",
    "however , the net change in the magic wavelengths for 2@xmath57 changes in the matrix elements is about 0.001 nm for the @xmath75 interval .",
    "the sensitivity to 2@xmath57 matrix element changes for the @xmath85 intervals is about 0.0001 nm due to the small polarizabilities of the @xmath11 states near 395 nm .",
    "the 850 nm magic wavelength is also relatively insensitive to changes in the overall size of the matrix elements , with the 2@xmath57 matrix element change leading to a change of only 0.0001 nm in the magic wavelengths .",
    "the low sensitivity of magic wavelengths to the overall size of the matrix elements in these cases means that these the magic wavelengths can be used to give precise estimates of the matrix element ratios of the two transitions in the spin - orbit doublet .",
    "the 1338 , 1309 , 1074 , 887 nm magic wavelengths show much greater sensitivity to 2@xmath57 changes in the matrix elements .",
    "the changes in the magic wavelengths range from 3 to 80 nm .",
    "the sensitivity of the magic wavelengths to these matrix elements is driven by the rate of change of the @xmath0 and @xmath11 polarizabilities with energy .",
    "a large change in the photon energy is needed to compensate for a small change in the polarizability when @xmath86 is small .",
    "the sensitivity of the magic wavelength to small changes in the matrix elements decreases as the photon energy gets closer to the @xmath87 excitation thresholds .",
    "the high sensitivity of the magic wavelengths with respect to changes in the matrix elements means it is only necessary to measure the magic wavelength to a precision of 0.10 nm to impose reasonably tight constraints on the ratios of the @xmath75 and @xmath87 matrix element rations .",
    "a relativistic semi - empirical core model is applied to the calculation of the dynamic polarizabilities of the @xmath0 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 states of ca@xmath3 .",
    "a number of magic wavelengths at convenient photon energies have been identified for the @xmath0-@xmath11 energy intervals .",
    "measurement of these magic wavelengths can be used to determine reasonably accurate estimates of the @xmath11-@xmath88 line strengths relative to the @xmath0-@xmath12 line strengths .",
    "this could lead to improved estimates of the blackbody radiation shift for the ca@xmath3 clock transition .",
    "there is one impediment . at the moment",
    "there is a 3@xmath57 spread between theoretical and experimental lifetimes for the @xmath88 states .",
    "this variation , which does not exist for the same transition in potassium @xcite , needs to resolved so the uncertainty in the @xmath89 line strengths can be reduced to 1@xmath57 or better .",
    "there are two other relatively clean measurements of atomic structure parameters that could be made .",
    "measurement of the magic wavelength near 395 nm could be used to determine a value of the oscillator strength @xmath64:@xmath65 ratio .",
    "this could help resolve the incompatible predictions of this ratio by dfcp / mbpt - sd and rcc calculations .",
    "comparisons of polarizabilities do suggest that the gaussian basis set used for the rcc calculations could be improved .",
    "further , measurements of the two longest magic wavelengths for the @xmath90 transition could give a good estimate of the @xmath73:@xmath91 ratio .",
    "the utility of measuring magic wavelengths for selected ca@xmath3 transitions can of course be extended to other alkaline - earth ions , with sr@xmath3 and ba@xmath3 being obvious possibilities .",
    "a single ion optical frequency standard at the 10@xmath92 level of precision has recently been reported for the @xmath93-@xmath94 transition of the sr@xmath3 ion @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the determination of the magic wavelengths for this transition could be used to improve the precision of estimates of the blackbody radiation shift for this transition @xcite .",
