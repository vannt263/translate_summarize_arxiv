    "underwater shock waves induced by illumination with a nanosecond laser pulse are utilized in various applications including low - invasive medical treatments @xcite .",
    "the laser - induced shock wave triggers a sudden motion of a liquid as well as a free surface , which , for instance , results in generation of high - speed microjets applicable for needle - free injection devices @xcite .    for the sudden motion of the liquid ,",
    "one of the most important quantities is pressure impulse @xcite .",
    "its definition is given as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is pressure of the liquid and @xmath2 is the elapsed time .",
    "@xcite numerically reproduced the high - speed microjet reported by @xcite and confirmed that the pressure impulse is the key quantity for the motion of the jet .",
    "thus detailed investigation for the pressure impulse of the laser - induced shock wave is of great importance .",
    "the shock wave has been often modeled as a _",
    "spherical shock _ , which assumes a spherically - symmetric pressure distribution and spherical shape of the shock .",
    "however , some researchers have pointed out that the spherical - shock model is not applicable in certain cases @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that a non - spherically - symmetric bubble is observed with the series of compression waves . @xcite",
    "measured pressure peaks for a shock at various positions and determined that the peak pressure at a point in the direction perpendicular to the laser beam is more than twice as high as that in the direction of the laser .",
    "@xcite reported that the shape of a shock wave is not spherical due to conical plasma formation . despite these considerations ,",
    "a common model for the pressure impulse of laser - induced shock waves has not been developed . in this study",
    ", we report on experimental observations of a laser - induced shock wave with a special attention to pressure impulse .",
    "we also propose a new model of the shock wave to rationalize the observations .",
    "such an observation is , however , challenging because each phenomenon involved in generating the shock occurs within a short time ; illumination with a laser pulse first triggers the emergence of plasma in water , which leads to rapid expansion of a bubble and emission of a shock wave @xcite .",
    "the time scale for plasma growth is in the order of nanoseconds and the shock velocity in water is approximately 1500 m / s . to the best of the authors knowledge , plasma growth , the expansion process of the shock , and pressure in water have been _ simultaneously _ measured for the first time , using a combined measurement system , in which ultra - high - speed recording systems and pressure sensors are installed .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup ] shows the combined measurement system .",
    "an underwater shock wave is induced by a 532 nm , 6 ns laser pulse ( nd : yag laser nano s piv , litron lasers ) focused through an objective lens to a point inside a water - filled glass tank ( 100@xmath3100@xmath3450 mm ) .",

    "the combined measurement system consists of two hydrophones ( muller platte - gauge , muller ) and two ultra - high - speed cameras .",

    "a laser - induced bubble then emerges where the plasma was formed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results10x](ii ) ) and its shape is also elongated in the direction of the laser beam . at @xmath2 = 0.4 @xmath8s , non - single spherical shocks are observed .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath2 = 2.4 @xmath8s , the shock could be regarded as a single spherical shock ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : results10x](iii ) ) . however , enlarged images for @xmath4 = @xmath5 and @xmath4 = @xmath6 ( fig .",

    "[ fig : results10x](iii ) @xmath4 = @xmath5 ) , which is different from the single shock wave for @xmath4 = @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results10x](iii ) @xmath4 = @xmath6 ) . figure  [ fig : results10x](iv ) shows the temporal evolution of pressure measured with the two hydrophones placed at different positions .",
    "there are two peaks for @xmath4 = @xmath5 , while there is a single large peak for @xmath4 = @xmath6 , which is approximately 1.3 times higher than that for @xmath4 = @xmath5 .",
    "note that this dependence of the peak pressure on the angle @xmath4 is the same as that reported by @xcite .",
    "for the 5@xmath3 objective lens , this trend is much more pronounced : four plasma groups and four shock waves separated from each other are evident ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : results5x ] ) . here , we compute the pressure impulse for @xmath4 = @xmath5 , @xmath10 , and that for @xmath4 = @xmath6 , @xmath11 . we calculate pressure impulse for @xmath2 = 2.5 to 4.5 @xmath8s ,",
    "during which time - lags of plasma formation ( @xmath1210 ns ) is totally covered , i.e. the time - lags do not affect the results of pressure impulse .",
    "both @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the shock obtained with 10@xmath3 objective lens are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results10x](iv ) in the unit of pa@xmath13s .",
    "@xmath10 is in reasonable agreement with @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , pressure impulse and peak pressure for @xmath4 = 0@xmath14 and 90@xmath14 were examined for all the other experimental conditions . while peak pressure for @xmath4 = 0@xmath14 and 90 @xmath14 differ significantly as show in fig  [ fig : peak_impulse](a ) , the @xmath10 was in agreement with the corresponding @xmath11 within the experimental uncertainty for a wide range of experimental parameters ( fig  [ fig : peak_impulse](b ) ) .",
    "note that the order of pressure impulse in this study is the same order of the practical use for drug delivery for cytoplasmic molecules @xcite and generation of microjets @xcite .",
    "based on the aforementioned results , we here propose a model for the structure of the laser - induced shock wave : the shock has a multiple structure that consists of multiple spherical shock waves as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] .",
    "we assume that each spherical shock wave originates from the corresponding plasma formation .",
    "in addition , since the shock wave behaves acoustically with low pressure ( @xmath15 100 mpa @xcite ) , we could apply the _ superposition principle _ :",
    "the net pressure that is produced by two or more shock waves reaching the same point is the sum of the pressure induced by the individual shock waves .",
    "a phenomenon that is analogous to this may be the surface wave observed after one or several stones are thrown into a quiescent pond ( the so - called huygens  fresnel principle ) . for both the 10@xmath3 and 5@xmath3 objective lens , this model rationalizes the observations of both pressure peaks and pressure impulse : several peaks for @xmath4 = @xmath5 and the single large peak for @xmath4 = @xmath6 while pressure impulse for @xmath4 = @xmath5 matches pressure impulse for @xmath4 = @xmath6 .",
    "results for a wide range of experimental parameters ( fig  [ fig : peak_impulse ] ) may indicate the universality of the multiple structure model .",
    "note that this scenario includes the well - known spherical - shock model .",
    "it should be emphasized that , as observed with the 10@xmath3 objective lens ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results10x ] ) , even if just a single plasma or a bubble is observed , the origin of the _ elongated _ plasma and bubble is expected to be multiple spots of plasma , which leads to the emergence of a multiple spherical shocks , resulting in a notable angular variation of shock pressure .",
    "this model for the multiple shock structure could possibly rationalize the results reported in previous research .",
    "for instance , @xcite reported that a laser - induced shock wave emitted from an elongated plasma has an angular variation of pressure distribution .",
    "although the shape of the shock wave appears to be spherical , the elongated plasma shape may cause a multiple - structure of the shock , as observed in the present experiments ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : results10x ] ) , which would lead to a non - spherically - symmetric pressure peak of the shock .    here",
    ", attention is given to plasma formation , which is the origin of the multiple shock structure .",
    "figure  [ fig : plasma ] shows the plasma luminescence under all the experimental conditions .",
    "the multiple plasma formation is dependent on the spherical aberrations of the focusing optics , liquid impurities and the input laser energy @xcite .",
    "plasma is generated where the energy density is locally enhanced @xcite .",
    "as the input laser energy is increased , the region of plasma generation is enlarged more in the direction of the laser pulse beam , due to extension of the high energy density region . in the case of the 5@xmath3 objective lens , the region of plasma generation is enlarged in the direction of the laser pulse beam , due to the small convergence angle ( the maximum angle of the input laser beam to the optical axis ) .",
    "the regions of plasma generation with the 10@xmath3 and 20@xmath3 objective lens are smaller than that with the 5@xmath3 objective lens because the convergence angles for the 10@xmath3 and 20@xmath3 objective lens are larger than that for the 5@xmath3 objective lens .",
    "in order to investigate a laser - induced shock wave with focusing on pressure impulse , we constructed a measurement system consisting of a combination of ultra - high - speed cameras and pressure sensors .",
    "shock pressure was measured with two hydrophones arranged at @xmath4 = @xmath5 and @xmath4 = @xmath6 with respect to the laser direction , and plasma formation and shock wave expansion were simultaneously observed using two ultra - high - speed video cameras .",
    "the most important finding in this paper is that the distribution of pressure impulse of a shock wave is spherically symmetric for a wide range of experimental parameters even when the distribution of peak pressure is non - spherically - symmetric .",
    "we proposed a multiple structure model for the laser - induced shock wave : the laser - induced shock wave is a collection of spherical shock waves emitted from the bright spots inside the area of plasma luminescence .",
    "the multiple structure is dependent on the plasma shape generated by illumination with the laser pulse .    as an outlook",
    ", it should be noted again that the multiple shock structure ensures the same pressure impulse in all directions .",
    "this feature may provide high degrees of freedom for the design of needle - free injection devices using high - speed microjets . by changing the plasma shape with control parameters ( magnification of the objective lens or the input laser energy ) , the anisotropy of the shock pressure could be controlled , which might be applicable to a variety of advanced techniques .",
    "future numerical simulation based on the multiple - structure model is expected to provide additional support for this model .",
