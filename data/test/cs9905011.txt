    "cervical carcinoma is the second most common cancer in women worldwide , exceeded only by breast cancer  @xcite .",
    "the mortality related to cervical cancer can be reduced if this disease is detected at its pre - cancerous state , known as squamous intraepithelial lesion ( sil )  @xcite . even though widespread use of organized screening ( pap smear ) and diagnostic ( colposcopy ) programs are currently in place ,",
    "approximately 15,900 new cases of cervical cancer and 4,900 cervical cancer related deaths were reported in the united states alone , in 1995  @xcite .",
    "currently , the primary screening tool for the detection of cervical cancer and its precursor is the pap smear  @xcite . in a pap test",
    ", a large number of cells obtained by scraping the cervical epithelium are smeared onto a slide which is then fixed and stained for cytologic examination . each smear",
    "is then examined under a microscope for the presence of neoplastic cells  @xcite .",
    "the pap smear is unable to achieve a concurrently high sensitivity and high specificity  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the pap smear is limited by both sampling and reading errors  @xcite .",
    "approximately 60% of false - negative smears are attributed to insufficient sampling ; the remaining 40% are due to reading errors . because of the monotony and fatigue associated with reading pap smears ( 50,000 - 300,000 cells per slide ) ,",
    "the american society of cytology has proposed that a cyto - technologist should be limited to evaluating no more than 12,000 smears annually  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "accurate pap smear screening is labor intensive and requires highly trained professionals .",
    "some new tools ( thinkprep , papnet , autopap ) to assist cyto - technologists have recently been introduced , but they are all based on invasive techniques  @xcite .    a patient with a pap smear interpreted as indicating the presence of sil is followed up by a diagnostic procedure called colposcopy  @xcite . during a colposcopic examination ,",
    "the cervix is stained with acetic acid and viewed through a low power microscope to identify potential pre - cancerous sites .",
    "subsequently , suspicious sites are biopsied and then histologically examined to confirm the presence , extent and severity of the lesion  @xcite .",
    "colposcopic examination in expert hands maintains a high sensitivity at the expense of a significantly low specificity , leading to many unnecessary biopsies  @xcite . in spite of the poor specificity of this technique",
    ", extensive training is required to achieve this skill level .",
    "furthermore , since this procedure involves biopsy , which requires histologic evaluation , diagnosis is not immediate  @xcite .",
    "laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy is an optical technique which has the capability to quickly , non - invasively and quantitatively probe the biochemical and morphological changes that occur as tissue becomes neoplastic .",
    "the altered biochemical and morphological state of the neoplastic tissue is reflected in the spectral characteristics of the measured fluorescence .",
    "this spectral information can be correlated to tissue histo - pathology , the current `` gold standard '' to develop clinically effective screening algorithms .",
    "these mathematical algorithms can be implemented in software , potentially enabling automated , fast , non - invasive and accurate pre - cancer detection in hands of non - experts .",
    "although a complete understanding of the quantitative information contained within a tissue fluorescence spectrum has not been achieved , many groups have investigated the use of fluorescence spectroscopy for real - time , non - invasive , automated characterization of tissue pathology  @xcite .    a detection technique for human cervical pre - cancer based on laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy has been developed recently  @xcite .",
    "discrimination was achieved using a multivariate statistical algorithm ( msa ) based on principal component analysis ( pca ) and logistic discrimination of tissue spectra acquired _ in vivo_. this linear method of algorithm development demonstrated an improved classification accuracy relative to both the pap smear and colposcopy in expert hands . in this article , we investigate neural network based non - linear methods for algorithm development , and compare them to both the msa and conventional clinical methods .",
    "specifically , we investigate the performance of multi - layered perceptron ( mlp ) and radial basis function ( rbf ) networks , and ensembles of these networks , on cervical tissue fluorescence spectra .",
    "the connectionist methods aim at improving the classification accuracy and reliability of the msa , as well as simplifying the decision making process .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] presents the data collection / processing techniques . in section  [ sec : algo ] , the msa , and the neural network based methods are described .",
    "section  [ sec : resu ] contains the results of our analysis and compares the neural network results to that of the msa and current clinical detection methods .",
    "a discussion of the results is given in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "a portable fluorimeter consisting of two nitrogen pumped - dye lasers , a fiber - optic probe and a polychromator coupled to an intensified diode array controlled by an optical multi - channel analyzer was utilized to measure fluorescence spectra from the cervix _ in vivo _ at three excitation wavelengths : 337 , 380 and 460 nm @xcite .",
    "data acquisition , calibration and processing have been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a randomly selected group of non - pregnant patients referred to the colposcopy clinic of the university of texas md anderson cancer center on the basis of abnormal cervical cytology was asked to participate in the _ in vivo _ fluorescence spectroscopy study .",
    "informed consent was obtained from each patient who participated and the study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of the university of texas , austin and the university of texas , md anderson cancer center .",
    "each patient underwent a complete history and a physical examination including a pelvic exam , a pap smear and colposcopy of the cervix , vagina and vulva .",
    "after colposcopic examination of the cervix , but before tissue biopsy , fluorescence spectra were acquired on average from two colposcopically abnormal sites , two colposcopically normal squamous sites and 1 normal columnar site ( if colposcopically visible ) from each patient , from a total of 361 cervical sites in 95 patients .",
    ".histo - pathologic classification of samples from the training and test sets .",
    "note , biopsies for histological evaluation were not obtained from colposcopically normal squamous and columnar tissue sites to comply with routine patient care procedure . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig : sen ] further illustrates the trade - off between specificity and sensitivity for clinical methods , msa and rbf ensembles , obtained by changing the misclassification cost .",
    "the one - step rbf ensembles provide better sensitivity and higher reliability than any other method for a given specificity value .",
    "in this article we demonstrate that cervical tissue fluorescence spectra can be used to develop detection algorithms that differentiate sils from normal tissue samples . of the various algorithms",
    "explored , the rbf network ensemble proved to be the best alternative , surpassing single networks , mlp ensembles , and the multivariate statistical algorithm .",
    "the classification results of both the multivariate statistical algorithms and the radial basis function network ensembles demonstrate that significant improvement in classification accuracy can be achieved over current clinical detection modalities using cervical tissue spectral data obtained from _ in vivo _ fluorescence spectroscopy .",
    "the one - step rbf algorithm has the potential to significantly reduce the number of pre - cancerous cases missed by pap smear screening and the number of normal tissues misdiagnosed by expert colposcopists .",
    "the qualitative nature of current clinical detection modalities leads to a significant variability in classification accuracy .",
    "for example , estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of pap smear screening have been shown to range from 11 - 99% and 14 - 97% , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this limitation can be addressed by exploiting the variance reducing properties of an ensemble approach . in particular , rbf ensembles demonstrate a significantly smaller variability in classification accuracy , therefore enabling more reliable classification .",
    "in addition to demonstrating a superior sensitivity , the rbf ensembles simplify the decision making process of the two - step algorithms based on rbf and msa into a single step that discriminates between sils and normal tissues .",
    "we note that for the given data set , both msa and mlp were unable to provide satisfactory solutions in one step .",
    "the one - step algorithm development process can be readily implemented in software , enabling automated detection of cervical pre - cancer .",
    "it can potentially provide near real time implementation of pre - cancer detection in the hands of non - experts , and could lead to wide - scale implementation of screening and diagnosis , and more effective patient management in the prevention of cervical cancer .",
    "the success of this application will represent an important step forward in both medical laser spectroscopy and gynecologic oncology .",
