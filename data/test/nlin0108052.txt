    "many important problems in the theory of integrable systems and approximation theory can be recast as riemann - hilbert problems for a matrix - valued unknown . via the connection with approximation theory , and specifically the theory of orthogonal polynomials",
    ", one can also study problems from the theory of random matrix ensembles and combinatorics . roughly speaking , solving a riemann - hilbert problem",
    "amounts to reconstructing a sectionally meromorphic matrix from given homogeneous multiplicative `` jump conditions '' at the boundary contours of the domains of meromorphy , from `` principal part data '' given at the prescribed singularities , and from a normalization condition .",
    "so , many asymptotic questions in integrable systems ( _ e.g. _ long time behavior and singular perturbation theory ) and approximation theory ( _ e.g. _ behavior of orthogonal polynomials in the limit of large degree ) amount to determining asymptotic properties of the solution matrix of a riemann - hilbert problem from given asymptotics of the jump conditions and principal part data .    in recent years a collection of techniques has emerged for studying certain asymptotic problems of this sort .",
    "these techniques are analogous to familiar asymptotic methods for expanding oscillatory integrals , and we often refer to them as `` steepest - descent '' methods .",
    "the basic method first appeared in the work of deift and zhou @xcite .",
    "the first applications were to riemann - hilbert problems without poles , in which the solution matrix is sectionally holomorphic .",
    "later , some problems were studied in which there were a number of poles  a number held fixed in the limit of interest  in the solution matrix ( see , for example , the paper @xcite on the long - time behavior of the toda lattice with rarefaction initial data ) . the previous methods were extended to these more complicated problems through the device of making a local change of variable near each pole in some small domain containing the pole .",
    "the change of variable is chosen so that it has the effect of removing the pole at the cost of introducing an explicit jump on the boundary of the domain around the pole in which the transformation is made .",
    "the result is a riemann - hilbert problem for a sectionally holomorphic matrix , which can be solved asymptotically by pre - existing `` steepest - descent '' methods .",
    "recovery of an approximation for the original sectionally meromorphic matrix unknown involves putting back the poles by reversing the explicit change of variables that was designed to get rid of them to begin with .",
    "yet another category of riemann - hilbert problems consists of those problems where the number of poles is not fixed , but becomes large in the limit of interest , with the poles accumulating on some closed set @xmath0 in the finite complex plane .",
    "a problem of this sort has been addressed @xcite by making an explicit transformation of the type described above in a single fixed domain @xmath1 that contains the locus of accumulation @xmath0 of all the poles .",
    "the transformation is chosen to get rid of all the poles at once . in order to specify it , discrete data related to the residues of the poles",
    "must be interpolated at the corresponding poles by a function that is analytic and nonvanishing in all of @xmath1 .",
    "once the poles have been removed in this way , the riemann - hilbert problem becomes one for a sectionally holomorphic matrix , with a jump at the boundary of @xmath1 given in terms of the explicit change of variables . in this way ,",
    "the poles are `` swept out '' from @xmath0 to the boundary of @xmath1 resulting in an analytic jump .",
    "there is a strong analogy in this procedure with the concept of balayage ( meaning `` sweeping out '' ) from potential theory .    in establishing asymptotic formulae for such riemann - hilbert problems ,",
    "it is essential that one make judicious use of the freedom to place the boundary of the domain in which one removes the poles from the problem .",
    "placing this boundary contour in the correct position in the complex plane allows one to convert oscillations into exponential decay in such a way that the errors in the asymptotics can be rigorously controlled .",
    "if the poles accumulate with some smooth density on @xmath2 , the characterization of the correct location of the boundary of @xmath1 can be determined by first passing to a continuum limit of the pole distribution in the resulting jump matrix on the boundary of @xmath1 , and then applying analytic techniques or variational methods .",
    "the continuum limit is justified as long as the boundary of @xmath1 remains separated from @xmath0 .",
    "this idea leads to an interesting question .",
    "what happens if the boundary of @xmath1 as determined from passing to the continuum limit turns out to intersect @xmath0 ?",
    "far from being a hypothetical possibility , this situation is known to occur in at least three different problems :    1 .   * the semiclassical limit of the focusing nonlinear schrdinger hierarchy with decaying initial data . *",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this is an inverse - scattering problem for the nonselfadjoint zakharov - shabat operator . on an _ ad hoc _ basis ,",
    "one replaces the true spectral data for the given initial condition with a formal wkb approximation .",
    "there is no jump in the riemann - hilbert problem associated with inverse - scattering for the modified spectral data , but there are poles accumulating asymptotically with the wkb density of states on an interval @xmath0 of the imaginary axis in the complex plane of the eigenvalue .",
    "the methods described above turn out to yield rigorous asymptotics for this modified inverse - scattering problem as long as the independent time variable in the equation is not zero . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the argument of passing to the continuum limit in the pole density leads one to choose the boundary of @xmath1 to _ coincide _ in part with the interval @xmath0 .",
    "strangely , if one sets @xmath3 in the problem from the beginning , an alternative method due to lax and levermore @xcite and extended to the nonselfadjoint zakharov - shabat operator with real potentials by ercolani , jin , levermore , and macevoy @xcite can be used to carry out the asymptotic analysis in this special case ; this alternative method is not based on matrix riemann - hilbert problems , and therefore when taken together with the methods described in @xcite does not result in a uniform treatment of the semiclassical limit for all @xmath4 and @xmath5 . at the same time , the lax - levermore method that applies when @xmath3 fails in this problem when @xmath6 .",
    "2 .   * the zero - dispersion limit of the korteweg - de vries equation with potential well initial data . * as pointed out above , the original treatment of this problem by lax and levermore @xcite was not based on asymptotic analysis for a matrix - valued riemann - hilbert problem . but it is possible to pose the inverse - scattering problem with modified ( wkb ) spectral data as a matrix - valued riemann - hilbert problem and ask whether the `` steepest descent '' techniques for such problems could be used to reproduce and/or strengthen the original asymptotic results of lax and levermore . in particular , we might point out that the lax - levermore method only gives weak limits of the conserved densities , and that a modification due to venakides @xcite is required to extract any pointwise asymptotics ( _ i.e. _ to reconstruct the microstruture of the modulated and rapidly oscillatory wavetrains giving rise to the leading - order weak asymptotics ) . on the other hand , `` steepest descent '' techniques for matrix - valued riemann - hilbert problems typically give pointwise asymptotics automatically",
    ". it would therefore be most useful if these techniques could be applied to provide a new and unified approach to this problem .",
    "+ if one tries to enclose the locus of accumulation of poles ( wkb eigenvalues for the schrdinger operator with a potential well ) with a contour and determine the optimal location of this contour for zero - dispersion asymptotics , it turns out that the contour must contain the support of a certain weighted logarithmic equilibrium measure .",
    "it is a well - known consequence of the lax - levermore theory that the support of this measure is a subset of the interval of accumulation of wkb eigenvalues .",
    "consequently , the enclosing contour `` wants '' to lie right on top of the poles in this problem , and the approach fails . in a sense",
    "this failure of the `` steepest descent '' method is more serious than in the analogous problem for the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation because the contour is in the wrong place for all values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( the independent variables of the problem ) , whereas in the focusing nonlinear schrdinger problem the method fails generically only for @xmath3 .",
    "* the large degree limit of certain systems of discrete orthogonal polynomials .",
    "* fokas , its , and kitaev @xcite have shown that the problem of reconstructing the orthogonal polynomials associated with a given continuous weight function can be expressed as a matrix - valued riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "it is not difficult to modify their construction to the case when the weight function is a sum of dirac masses .",
    "the corresponding matrix - valued riemann - hilbert problem has no jump , but has poles at the support nodes of the weight .",
    "the solution of this riemann - hilbert problem gives in this case the associated family of discrete orthogonal polynomials .",
    "if one takes the nodes of support of the discrete weight to be distributed asymptotically in some systematic way , then it is natural to ask whether `` steepest descent '' methods applied to the corresponding riemann - hilbert problem with poles could yield accurate asymptotic formulae for the discrete orthogonal polynomials in the limit of large degree . indeed",
    ", similar asymptotics were obtained in the continuous weight case @xcite using precisely these methods .",
    "+ unfortunately , when the poles are encircled and the optimal contour is sought , it turns out again to be necessary that the contour contain the support of a certain weighted logarithmic equilibrium measure ( see @xcite for a description of this measure ) which is supported on a subset of the interval of accumulation of the nodes of orthogonalization ( _ i.e. _ , the poles ) . for this reason ,",
    "the method based on matrix - valued riemann - hilbert problems would appear to fail .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new technique in the theory of `` steepest descent '' asymptotic analysis for matrix riemann - hilbert problems that solves all three problems mentioned above in a general framework . we illustrate the method in detail for the first case described above : the inverse - scattering problem for the nonselfadjoint zakharov - shabat operator with modified ( wkb ) spectral data , which amounts to a treatment of the semiclassical limit for the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation at the initial instant @xmath3 .",
    "this work thus fills in a gap in the arguments in @xcite connecting the rigorous asymptotic analysis carried out there with the initial - value problem for the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "application of the same techniques to the zero dispersion limit of the korteweg - de vries equation will be the topic of a future paper , and a study of asymptotics for discrete orthogonal polynomials using these methods is already in preparation @xcite .",
    "the initial - value problem for the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation is @xmath7 subject to the initial condition @xmath8 . in @xcite , this problem",
    "is considered for cases when the initial data @xmath9 where @xmath10 is some positive real function @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the function @xmath10 is taken to decay rapidly at infinity and to be even in @xmath4 with a single genuine maximum at @xmath12 .",
    "thus @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "also , the function @xmath10 is taken to be real - analytic . with this given initial data ,",
    "one has a unique solution of ( [ eq : nls ] ) for each @xmath16 . to study",
    "the semiclassical limit then means determining asymptotic properties of the family of solutions @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "this problem is associated with the scattering and inverse - scattering theory for the nonselfadjoint zakharov - shabat eigenvalue problem @xcite : @xmath19 for auxiliary functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the complex number @xmath22 is a spectral parameter . under the conditions on @xmath10 described above ,",
    "it is known only that for each @xmath16 the discrete spectrum of this problem is invariant under complex conjugation and reflection through the origin .",
    "however , a formal wkb method applied to ( [ eq : zs ] ) suggests for small @xmath23 a distribution of eigenvalues that are confined to the imaginary axis .",
    "the same method suggests that the reflection coefficient for scattering states obtained for real @xmath22 is small beyond all orders .",
    "it is therefore natural to propose a modification of the problem . rather than studying the inverse - scattering problem for",
    "the true spectral data ( which is not known ) , simply replace the true spectral data by its formal wkb approximation in which the eigenvalues are given by a quantization rule of bohr - sommerfeld type , and in which the reflection coefficient is neglected entirely . for each @xmath16 , this modified spectral data is the _ true _ spectral data for some other ( @xmath23-dependent ) initial condition @xmath24 .",
    "since there is no reflection coefficient in the modified problem , it turns out that for each @xmath23 the solution of ( [ eq : nls ] ) corresponding to the modified initial data @xmath24 is an exact @xmath25-soliton solution , with @xmath26 .",
    "we call such a family of @xmath25-soliton solutions , all obtained from the same function @xmath10 by a wkb procedure , a _",
    "semiclassical soliton ensemble _ , or sse for short .",
    "we will be more precise about this idea in   [ sec : sses ] . in @xcite , the asymptotic behavior of sses",
    "was studied for @xmath6 .",
    "although the results were rigorous , it was not possible to deduce anything about the _ true _ initial - value problem for ( [ eq : nls ] ) with @xmath27 because the asymptotic method failed for @xmath3 . in this paper , we will explain the following new result .",
    "let @xmath10 be real - analytic , even , and decaying with a single genuine maximum at @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath28 be for each @xmath16 the exact initial value of the sse corresponding to @xmath10 ( see   [ sec : sses ] ) .",
    "then , there exists a sequence of values of @xmath23 , @xmath29 for @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 and such that for all @xmath32 , there exists a constant @xmath33 such that @xmath34 for all @xmath35 .",
    "[ theorem : mainresult ]    as @xmath28 is obtained by an inverse - scattering procedure applied to wkb spectral data , this theorem establishes in a sense the validity of the wkb approximation for the zakharov - shabat eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : zs ] ) .",
    "it says that the true spectral data and the formally approximate spectral data generate , via inverse - scattering , potentials in the zakharov - shabat problem that are pointwise close .",
    "the omission of @xmath12 is merely technical ; a procedure slightly different from that we will explain in this paper is needed to handle this special case .",
    "we will indicate as we proceed the modifications that are necessary to extend the result to the whole real line .",
    "the pointwise nature of the asymptotics is important ; the variational methods used in @xcite suggest convergence only in the @xmath36 sense .",
    "rigorous statements about the nature of the wkb approximation for the zakharov - shabat problem are especially significant because the operator in ( [ eq : zs ] ) is nonselfadjoint and the spectrum is not confined to any axis ; furthermore sturm - liouville oscillation theory does not apply .",

    "clearly the bohr - sommerfeld rule ( [ eq : bs ] ) implies that choosing different integer values of @xmath79 in ( [ eq : gammainterpolate ] ) will yield the same set of numbers @xmath50 .",

    "the asymptotic method we will now develop for studying riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp : meromorphic ] for sses is especially well - adapted to studying the case of @xmath3 , where the method described in detail in @xcite fails . to illustrate the new method , we therefore set @xmath3 in the rest of this paper . also , we anticipate the utility of tying the value of the parameter @xmath86 to the remaining independent variable @xmath4 by setting @xmath87 in all subsequent formulae in which the index @xmath51 appears it should be assumed to be assigned a definite value according to ( [ eq : jdef ] )",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , in @xcite this transformation can be accomplished by encircling the locus of accumulation of the poles , here the imaginary interval @xmath64 , with a loop contour in the upper half - plane and making a specific change of variables based on the interpolation formula ( [ eq : gammainterpolate ] ) for some value of @xmath80 in the interior of the region enclosed by the loop and also in the complex - conjugate region .",
    "one then tries to choose the position of the loop contour in the complex plane that is best adapted to asymptotic analysis of the resulting holomorphic riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "the trouble with this approach is that it turns out that for @xmath3 the `` correct '' placement of the contour requires that part of it should lie on a subset of the imaginary interval @xmath64 , that is , right on top of the accumulating poles !",
    "for such a choice of the loop contour , the boundary values taken by the transformed matrix on the outside of the loop would be singular and the `` steepest descent '' theory would not apply .",
    "so taking the point of view that making any particular choice of @xmath80 in ( [ eq : gammainterpolate ] ) leads to problems , we propose to simultaneously make use of _ two distinct values of @xmath79 _ in passing to a riemann - hilbert problem for a sectionally holomorphic matrix .",

    "although we have specified the contour @xmath101 to coincide with a segment of the imaginary axis , the reader will see that the same statements concerning the analyticity of @xmath96 and the continuity of the boundary values on @xmath98 also hold when @xmath101 is taken to be absolutely any smooth contour in the upper half - plane connecting @xmath116 to @xmath117 .",

    "note that as a consequence of the symmetry of @xmath809 and @xmath133 under complex conjugation , we have @xmath821 .",
    "if the parametrix is indeed a good model for @xmath133 , then we must be able to show that the matrix @xmath822 is uniformly close to the identity matrix in the whole complex plane .    while we do not know @xmath822 explicitly like we know @xmath809 , we know from the normalization condition of both factors that @xmath823 it turns out that we can also calculate explicitly the ratio of boundary values taken by @xmath822 from both sides on each arc of @xmath820 .",
    "that is , we know the jump matrix for @xmath824 , and can express it explicitly in terms of @xmath825 and the jump matrix for @xmath133 , both of which are known in terms of the matrix function @xmath826 for which we have an existence proof and a characterization , but not an explicit formula . ] .",

    ", we will show that indeed @xmath822 is uniformly close to the identity matrix .",
    "there are two kinds of arcs in the contour @xmath820 : `` matching '' arcs of the circles @xmath682 , @xmath827 , and @xmath611 where two different components of the parametrix have to match well onto each other , and the remaining arcs within the disks and outside the disks where the jump matrix for @xmath809 should be a good approximation to that of @xmath388 .",
    "consider one of the arcs of @xmath820 oriented in some convenient way , and as usual let the subscript `` @xmath107 '' ( respectively `` @xmath108 '' ) denote a boundary value taken on the arc from its left ( respectively right ) .",

    "proposition  [ prop : noutproperties ] guarantees that the conjugating factors @xmath871 and @xmath872 are uniformly bounded as @xmath118 tends to zero .",

    "the @xmath810 appears because we need the estimate down to the outside boundary of the shrinking disk at the origin .",
    "next we look at the contours @xmath357 and @xmath358 . on these contours",
    "there is no jump for @xmath133 , and we see directly from proposition  [ prop : noutproperties ] that @xmath876 is exponentially small as @xmath118 tends to zero through positive values .",
    "the next contour we examine is the portion of @xmath101 lying above the disk @xmath399 . here",
    "we observe that @xmath401 has no jump , and because we have on this contour the strict inequality @xmath353 , the matrix @xmath877 is exponentially close to the identity matrix . to see this , note",

    ". while the relative error in replacing @xmath267 by @xmath879 is not small near @xmath117 , it is bounded .",

    "therefore , for all @xmath861 outside all disks , we have @xmath880 for all @xmath268 .",
    "we come up with an overall estimate for @xmath881 for @xmath837 by combining the estimates ( [ eq : ve1 ] ) , ( [ eq : ve2 ] ) , ( [ eq : ve3 ] ) , ( [ eq : ve4 ] ) , and ( [ eq : ve5 ] ) , and optimizing the error by choosing the parameter @xmath810 .",
    "the optimal balance among all @xmath882 comes from taking @xmath835 , which gives an overall error estimate of @xmath883 uniformly for all @xmath861 , for all @xmath35 .",

    "the following is then a consequence of the @xmath36 theory of riemann - hilbert problems ( see the analogous discussion in @xcite ) .    for @xmath118",
    "sufficiently small , the riemann - hilbert problem for @xmath822 has a unique solution .",
    "let @xmath884 be sufficiently large so that @xmath820 is contained in the circle of radius @xmath885 centered at the origin .",
    "then uniformly for all @xmath22 outside of this circle , and for all @xmath268 however small , the matrix @xmath824 satisfies @xmath886 with the size of the matrix measured in any matrix norm .",
    "_ proof : _ only one thing must be verified in order to deduce existence and uniqueness from the general theory : the cauchy - kernel singular integral operators defined on the contour @xmath820 , which depends on @xmath118 because of the shrinking boundary of the circle at the origin , have @xmath887 norms that can be bounded uniformly in @xmath25 .",
    "but this fact follows in this case from the fact that for @xmath25 sufficiently large , the circle @xmath611 intersects only radial straight - line segments ( we chose the contours to all be exactly straight lines in some fixed neighborhood of the origin ) , so that the portion of @xmath820 near the origin simply scales with @xmath857 .",
    "the uniform bound we need can then be established using the fact that the cauchy operators commute with scaling .",
    "a similar result was established under more general conditions in @xcite .",
    "once existence and uniqueness have been established , the estimate of @xmath822 follows from an integral representation formula for this matrix : @xmath888 in which the matrix function @xmath41 for @xmath889 is an element of @xmath887 with a norm that is bounded independently of @xmath118 ( and in fact converges to the identity matrix in @xmath887 as @xmath118 tends to zero ) .",
    "@xmath105    we are now in a position to prove our main result , which we presented as theorem  [ theorem : mainresult ] in the introduction .    _ proof of theorem  [ theorem : mainresult ] : _ we have been setting @xmath3 all along , so the function @xmath890 given by ( [ eq : psi0define ] ) can be found from the matrix @xmath133 by the relation ( _ cf .",

    "_ equation ( [ eq : otildesolution ] ) ) for @xmath374 .",
    "we find @xmath896 which is the `` true '' initial data that we started with , before making any modifications based on the wkb approximation of the spectral data .",
    "when we consider the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : controlpsi ] ) , we see that as a consequence of the normalization of the matrices @xmath822 and @xmath825 , @xmath897 as @xmath135 .",
    "therefore the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : controlpsi ] ) vanishes identically .",

    "using the new technique of simultaneous interpolation of residues by two different analytic interpolating functions , combined with `` steepest - descent '' techniques for matrix - valued riemann - hilbert problems , we have established the validity of the formal wkb approximation of the spectrum in the nonselfadjoint zakharov - shabat eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : zs ] ) in the sense of pointwise convergence of the potentials . strictly speaking , our analysis applies to certain classes of potential functions whose most important property for our purposes is their real analyticity , and then we obtain convergence for all nonzero values of @xmath4 .    in order to extend the result of theorem  [ theorem : mainresult ] to @xmath12 ,",
    "some different steps are required . since @xmath900 as @xmath901 , the local analysis that we carried out independently for @xmath902 ( _ cf . _   [ sec : local_ia ] ) and for @xmath903 ( _ cf . _   [ sec : local_ia(x ) ] ) will need to be combined .",
    "consequently , a different local model for @xmath133 will need to be constructed near @xmath904 . due to the presence of the gamma functions in the asymptotics established in   [ sec : local_ia ] and given in proposition  [ prop : iaasymps ] and proposition  [ prop : iaasympt ] , it is likely that the construction of the local model will require knowledge of the solution of a new riemann - hilbert problem that , like that for the matrix @xmath568 in   [ sec : origin ] , can not be solved explicitly .",
    "nonetheless , one expects that to establish the validity of theorem  [ theorem : mainresult ] for @xmath12 will require only technical modifications of what we have done here .    understanding the nature of the wkb approximation at the level of the potentials is one step in a larger ongoing program to obtain corresponding information at the level of the ( unknown ) spectrum itself .",
    "indeed , quantifying the difference between the true spectrum of a given potential @xmath10 and the wkb approximation of the spectrum , in terms of motion of eigenvalues , will be necessary before it can be proven that the rigorous asymptotic analysis of sses is relevant to the problem of semiclassical asymptotics for the initial - value problem for the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ eq : nls ] ) .",
    "one imagines that a study of the semiclassical limit for ( [ eq : nls ] ) should proceed by first generating from the given initial data @xmath905 the corresponding well - defined sse , and then using the fact that by combining the results of @xcite with theorem  [ theorem : mainresult ] from this paper , one has a complete picture of the limiting behavior of the sse for an open interval of time @xmath5 that is independent of @xmath23 and includes @xmath3 , and moreover that according to theorem  [ theorem : mainresult ] the sse is pointwise close to the given initial data @xmath10 for @xmath3 .",
