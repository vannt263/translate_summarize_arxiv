    "after the analysis of the soft parts , the next step is to find out how one obtains the information on the various correlation functions from experiments , in this paper in particular lepton - hadron scattering via one - photon exchange as discussed in section 1 . to get the leading order result for semi - inclusive scattering it is sufficient to compute the diagram in fig .",

    "it is not difficult to give some general rules on how the distribution and fragmentation functions are encountered in experiments .",
    "i will just give a few examples .",
    "in 1-particle inclusive processes , one actually becomes sensitive to quark transverse momentum dependent distribution functions .",

    "the second cross section involves the structure function containing the distribution function @xmath119 and the time - reversal odd fragmentation function @xmath71 .",
    "the tilde functions that appear in the cross sections are in fact precisely the socalled interaction dependent parts of the twist three functions .",
    "they would vanish in any naive parton model calculation in which cross sections are obtained by folding electron - parton cross sections with parton densities .",
    "considering the relation for @xmath120 one can state it as @xmath121 = @xmath122 in the absence of quark - quark - gluon correlations .",
    "the inclusion of the latter also requires diagrams dressed with gluons .",
    "in the introduction we already mentioned the @xmath123 asymmetry in unpolarized leptoproduction .",
    "this asymmetry requires the presence of a t - odd distribution function . but note that the effect is leading order in @xmath35 , i.e. nonvanishing at large @xmath23 . as a final example we mention the possibility to use leptoproduction to resolve issues in other processes .",
    "for example , the single spin ( left - right ) asymmetry observed in @xmath124 could be attributed to a t - odd effect in the initial state ( sivers effect ) or a similar effect in the final state ( collins effect ) .",
    "these two effects or the relative importance of them could be decided by considering two different asymmetries in leptoproduction .",
    "let s consider for simplicity the two effects separately . in case one",
    "blames the single spin asymmetry fully on the initial state  @xcite it only involves the distribution function @xmath55 , while if it is blamed on the final state  @xcite it only involves the fragmentation function @xmath71 . by considering the asymmetries in leptoproduction ,",
    "mentioned below one could decide which effect is actually responsible  @xcite .",
    "in the previous section some results for 1-particle inclusive lepton - hadron scattering have been presented .",
    "several other effects are important in these cross sections , such as target fragmentation , the inclusion of gluons in the calculation to obtain color - gauge invariant definitions of the correlation functions and an electromagnetically gauge invariant result at order @xmath35 and finally qcd corrections which can be moved back and forth between hard and soft parts , leading to the scale dependence of the soft parts and the dglap equations .    in my talk",
    "i have tried to indicate why semi - inclusive , in particular 1-particle inclusive lepton - hadron scattering , can be important .",
    "the goal is the study of the quark and gluon structure of hadrons , emphasizing the dependence on transverse momenta of quarks .",
    "the reason why this prospect is promising is the existence of a field theoretical framework that allows a clean study involving well - defined hadronic matrix elements",
