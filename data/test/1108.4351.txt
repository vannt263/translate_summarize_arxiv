    "in a recent paper @xcite we proposed a model of projectile mutifragmentation which was applied to collisions of ni on be and ta at 140 mev / nucleon and xe on al at 790 mev / nucleon .",
    "the model gave reasonable answers for most of the cross - sections studied .",
    "the model requires integration over impact parameter . for a given impact parameter ,",
    "the part of the projectile that does not directly overlap with the target is sheared off and defines the projectile like fragment(plf ) .",
    "this is abrasion and appealing to the high enrgy of the beam , is calculated using straight line geometry .",
    "the plf has @xmath8 neutrons,@xmath9 protons and @xmath10 nucleons ( the corresponding quantities for the full projectile are labelled @xmath11 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the abraded system @xmath12 has a temperture . in the second stage",
    "this hot plf expands to one - third of the normal nuclear density . assuming statistical equilibrium the break up of the plf at a temperature @xmath0 is now calculated using the canonical thermodynamic model(ctm ) .",
    "the composites that result from this break up have the same temperature @xmath0 and can evolve further by sequential decay(evaporation ) . this is computed .",
    "cross - sections can now be compared with experiment .",
    "the agreements were reasonable except for very peripheral collisions and it was conjectured in @xcite that the main reason for this discrepancy was due to the assumption of constant @xmath0 over all impact parameters .",
    "full details are provided in @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to improve the model by incorporating an impact parameter dependence of @xmath1 . while we were led to this by computing the cross - sections of very large plf s ( which can only result from very peripheral collisions ) , the effect of temperature dependence",
    "is accentuated in other experiments .",
    "in fact these experiments can be used , with some aid from reasonable models , to extract `` experimental '' values for temperature @xmath0 at each @xmath2 .",
    "we spend considerable time studying this although our primary aim was and is the computation of cross - sections from a theoretical model .",
    "consider the abrasion stage .",
    "the projectile hits the target . use straight line geometry",
    ". we can then calculate the volume of the projectile that goes into the participant region ( eqs.a.4.4 and a.4.5 of ref @xcite ) .",
    "what remains in the plf is @xmath13 .",
    "this is a function of @xmath2 .",
    "if the original volume of the projectile is @xmath14 , the original number of neutrons is @xmath15 and the original number of protons is @xmath16 , then the average of neutrons in the plf is @xmath17n_0 $ ] and the average number of protons is @xmath18z_0 $ ] ; @xmath19 ( and similarly @xmath20 ) is usually a non - integer . since in any event only an integral number of neutrons ( and protons ) can appear in a plf we need a prescription to get integral numbers .",
    "let the two nearest integers to @xmath19 be @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that @xmath23=the probability that the abraded system has @xmath8 neutrons is zero unless @xmath24is either @xmath21 or @xmath25 . let @xmath26 where @xmath27 is less than 1",
    ". then @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "similar condions apply to @xmath30 .",
    "the probability that a plf with @xmath8 neutrons and @xmath9 protons materializes from a collision at impact parameter @xmath2 is given by @xmath31 .",
    "once this plf is formed it will expand and break up into composites at a temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we use ctm to obtain these .",
    "all the relevant details of ctm can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will not repeat these here .",
    "there can be very light fragments , intermediate mass fragments ( defined more precisely in the next section ) and heavier fragments .",
    "as the fragments are at temperature @xmath0 it is possible some of these will sequentially decay thereby changing the final population which is measured experimentally .",
    "details of evaporation can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "experimental data on @xmath32 as a function of @xmath33 ( see fig.1 in @xcite ) probably provide the strongest arguments for needing an impact parameter dependence of the temperature . here",
    "@xmath32 is the average multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments ( in this work those with @xmath34 between 3 and 20 ) and @xmath33=sum of all charges coming from plf minus particles with @xmath34=1 .",
    "for ease of arguments we will neglect , in this section , the difference between @xmath33 and @xmath9 , the total charge of all particles which originate from the plf .",
    "a large value of @xmath33 ( close to @xmath16 of the projectile ) signifies that the plf is large and the collision is peripheral ( large @xmath2 ) whereas a relatively smaller value of @xmath33 will imply more central collision ( small @xmath2 ) . for",
    "equal mass collision @xmath33 goes from zero to @xmath16 , the total charge of the projectile .",
    "the following gross features of heavy ion collisions at intermediate energy are known . if the excitation energy ( or the temperature ) of the dissociating system is low then one large fragment and a small number of very light fragments emerge .",
    "the average multiplicity of imf is very small . as the temperature increases , very light as well as intermediate mass fragments appear at the expense of the heavy fragment .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath32 will grow as a function of temperature , will reach a peak and then begin to go down as , at a high temperature , only light particles are dominant . for evidence and discussion of this see @xcite . for projectile fragmentation",
    "we are in the domain where @xmath32 rises with temperature .",
    "now at constant temperature , let us consider what must happen if the dissociating system grows bigger .",
    "we expect @xmath32 will increase with the size of the dissociating system , that is , with @xmath33 .",
    "experimental data are quite different : @xmath32 initially increases , reaches a maximum at a particular value of @xmath33 and then goes down .    in fig.1",
    "we show two graphs for @xmath32 , one in which the temperature is kept fixed ( at 6.73 mev ) and another in which @xmath0 decreases linearly from 7.5 mev ( at @xmath2=0)to 3 mev at @xmath35 .",
    "the calculation is qualitative .",
    "the case considered is @xmath36sn on @xmath37sn .",
    "ctm is used to calculate @xmath32 but evaporation is not included .",
    "simlarly @xmath33 is @xmath9 ( no correction for @xmath38 particles ) .",
    "fuller calculations will be shown later but the principal effects are all in the graphs . keeping the temparature fixed makes @xmath32 go up all the way till @xmath33=@xmath16 is reached .",
    "one needs the temperature to go down to bring down the value of @xmath32 as seen in experiment .",
    "in our model we can use an iterative technique to deduce a temperature from experimental data of @xmath32 @xmath39 @xmath33 . pick a @xmath2 ; abrasion gives a @xmath40 .",
    "guess a temperature @xmath0 . a full calculation with ctm and evaporation is now done to get a @xmath33 and @xmath32 .",
    "this @xmath33 will be close to @xmath40 .",
    "if the guessed value of temperature is too low then the calculated value of @xmath32 will be too little for this value of @xmath33 when confronted with data . in the next iteration",
    "the temperature will be raised .",
    "if on the other hand , for the guess value of @xmath0 , the calculated @xmath32 is too high , in the next iteration the temperature will be lowered .",
    "of course when we change @xmath0 , calculated @xmath33 will also shift but this change is smaller and with a small number of iterations one can approximately reproduce an experimental pair @xmath41 .    .",
    "best fit and experimental values for @xmath36sn on @xmath37sn .",
    "the first two columns are data from experiment .",
    "the next two columns are the values of @xmath33 and @xmath32 we get from our iterative procedure .",
    "these values are taken to be close enough to the experimental pair .",
    "these are obtained for a value of @xmath2 ( fifth column ) and a temperature @xmath0 ( sixth column ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + having deduced once for all such `` experimental data '' of @xmath0 @xmath39 @xmath2 , one can try simple parametrisation like @xmath42 . and see how well they fit the data .",
    "we show this for the two cases in fig.2 .    in fig.3 using such parametrised versions of @xmath0 we compute @xmath32 @xmath43 @xmath33 and compare with experimental data . except for fluctuations in the values of @xmath32 for very low values of @xmath33",
    "the fits are very good .",
    "we will return to the cases of fluctuations in a later section .",
    "in the preceding sections we have extracted temperatures @xmath0 ( combining data and model ) at values of @xmath2 ( equivalently at values of @xmath33 ) . this is a new method for extracting temperature .",
    "a more standard way of extracting temperatures is the albergo formula @xcite which has been widely used in the past ( for a review see , for example , @xcite ) . in [ @xcite ,",
    "figs.24 and 25 ] temperatures at selected values of @xmath44 were extracted from populations in [ @xmath45he,@xmath46li ] and [ @xmath47be,@xmath48li ] using albergo formula .",
    "these temperatures are compared in fig.4 with a typical temperature profile deduced here .",
    "it is gratifying to see that such different methods of extraction still give reasonable agreement .",
    "for small values of @xmath33 the measured @xmath32 shows considerable fluctuations as we go from one value of @xmath33 to another ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "our model does not reproduce these although general shapes are correct .",
    "statistical models are not expected to show such fluctuations but let us get into some details which ( a ) give a clue how such fluctuations may arise and ( b ) why our model misses them .",
    "the reader who is not interested in such details can skip the rest of this section without loss of continuity .    for definiteness ,",
    "consider the case of @xmath36sn on @xmath37sn . by the definition of @xmath49",
    ", @xmath32 is 0 when @xmath33 is 2 .",
    "consider now @xmath50 .",
    "the most direct way one can have this is if the plf has @xmath9=3 .",
    "taking very simplistic point of view , suppose , this also has @xmath51 , that is , the plf is @xmath52li .",
    "this is stable and we immediately get @xmath53 .",
    "this is indeed the experimental value .",
    "the case of @xmath33=4 may arise if the plf is @xmath54 , i.e. , if the plf is @xmath55be .",
    "but @xmath55be is unbound and will break up into two @xmath27 particles which are not @xmath56 s .",
    "thus @xmath32 drops to zero . in experiment",
    "this falls to about 0.3 rather than 0 .",
    "the simple fact that @xmath52li ( and an excited state of @xmath52li ) is particle stable whereas the states of @xmath55be are not is not embedded in our liquid - drop model for ground state and fermi - gas model for excited states .",
    "our description gets better for larger nuclear systems but for very small systems quantum mechanics of nuclear forces causes rapid changes in properties as one goes from one excited state to another and one nucleus to another .",
    "our model can not accommodate this .",
    "let us go back to the case of @xmath9=3 and treat it more realistically . using the abraison model ,",
    "when @xmath9 is 3 , plf can have @xmath8=3,4 and 5 .",
    "probabilities for higher and lower values of @xmath8 are small .",
    "following our model we get @xmath57 with @xmath33 slightly less than 3 . when @xmath9 is 4 , significant probabilities occur for@xmath8=5,6 and 7 .",
    "following our model we get a small increase in @xmath32 with @xmath33 whereas experimentally @xmath32 falls .",
    "this discrepancy happens because in the fermi - gas model there is very little difference between properties of ground and excited states of li and be whereas , in reality they are very different .",
    "a much more ambitious calculation for very small dissociating systems with @xmath9 between 3 and 7 where we take binding energies and values of excited state energies from experiments ( this becomes more and more unwieldy as @xmath9 increases ) is under way .",
    "fig.7 in ref @xcite shows that smm calculations are able to reproduce the fluctuations faithfully .",
    "actually in those calculations the occurrences of @xmath58 with associated @xmath59 are not calculated but guessed so that the ensemble produces the data as faithfully as possible . for further details how these calculations were done please refer to @xcite .",
    "knowing the temperature profile @xmath1 in one case , say @xmath36sn on @xmath37sn , can we anticipate what @xmath1 will be like in another case , say , @xmath60ni on @xmath61be ?",
    "in both the cases @xmath62 is zero and @xmath35 is @xmath63 yet we can not expect the same functional form @xmath64 for both the cases . in the first case , near @xmath65",
    "a small change in @xmath2 causes a large fractional change in the mass of the plf whereas , for @xmath60ni on @xmath61be , near @xmath2=0 , a small change in @xmath2 causes very little change in the mass of the plf .",
    "thus we might expect the temperature to change more rapidly in the first case near @xmath2=0 , whereas , in the second case , the temperature may change very little since not much changed when @xmath2 changed a little . in fact , for ni on be , transport model calculations , hipse ( heavy ion phase space exploration ) and amd ( antisymmetrised molecular dynamics ) find that starting from @xmath2=0 , excitation energy / per particle changes very little in the beginning @xcite . in terms of our model",
    ", this would mean that for ni on be , @xmath0 would be slow to change in the beginning .",
    "we might argue that a measure of the wound that the projectile suffers in a heavy ion collision is @xmath66 and that the temperature depends upon the wound .",
    "thus we should expect @xmath67 . just as we can write @xmath68",
    "so also we could expand in powers of @xmath69,i.e .",
    ", @xmath70 we try such fits to the `` experimental '' temperature profile given in tables i and ii . from @xmath2",
    "we deduce @xmath69 and plot @xmath0 as a function of @xmath69 .",
    "a linear fit appears to be good enough ( fig.5 ) .",
    "the specification that @xmath3 has profound consequences .",
    "this means the temperature profile @xmath71 of @xmath36sn on @xmath37sn is very different from that of @xmath60ni on @xmath61be . in the first case",
    "@xmath69 is nearly zero for @xmath72=0 whereas in the latter case @xmath69 is @xmath73 for @xmath72=0 . for @xmath6=7.5 mev and @xmath7=-4.5 mev ,",
    "the temperature profiles are compared in fig.6 .",
    "even more remarkable feature is that the temperature profile of @xmath60ni on @xmath61be is so different from the temperature profile of @xmath60ni on @xmath74ta . in the latter case @xmath75 and beyond @xmath62",
    ", @xmath69 grows from zero to 1 for @xmath35 .",
    "this is very similar to the temperature profile of @xmath36sn on @xmath37sn .",
    "now that we have established that temperature @xmath0 should be considered impact parameter @xmath2 dependent , let us write down how cross - sections should be evaluated .",
    "we first start with abrasion cross - section . in eq.(1 ) of @xcite , the abrasion cross - section was written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the probability that a plf with @xmath8 neutrons and @xmath9 protons emerges in collision at impact parameter @xmath2 .",
    "actually there is an extra parameter that needs to be specified .",
    "the complete labelling is @xmath78 if we assume that irrespective of the value of @xmath2 , the plf has a temperature @xmath0 .",
    "here we have broadened this to the more general case where the temperature is dependent on the impact parameter @xmath2 .",
    "thus the plf with @xmath8 neutrons and @xmath9 protons will be formed in a small range of temperature ( as the production of a particular @xmath12 occurs in a small range of @xmath2 ) .    to proceed ,",
    "let us discretize .",
    "we divide the interval @xmath62 to @xmath35 into small segments of length @xmath79 .",
    "let the mid - point of the @xmath80-th bin be @xmath81 and the temperature for collision at @xmath81 be @xmath82 .",
    "then @xmath83 where @xmath84 plf s with the same @xmath12 but different @xmath82 s are treated independently .",
    "the rest of the calculation proceeds as in @xcite .",
    "if , after abrasion , we have , a system @xmath12 at temperature @xmath82 , ctm allows us to compute the average population of the composite with neutron number @xmath85 , proton number @xmath34 when this system breaks up ( this composite is at temperature @xmath82 ) .",
    "denote this by @xmath86 .",
    "it then follows , summing over all the abraded @xmath12 that can yield @xmath87 the primary cross - section for @xmath87 is @xmath88 finally , evaporation from these composites @xmath87 at temperatures @xmath82 is considered before comparing with experimental data .",
    "we will now show some results for cross - sections using our model and compare with experimental data .",
    "we first show results for @xmath36sn on @xmath37sn and @xmath89sn on @xmath37sn at 600 mev / nucleon beam energy .",
    "the experimental data are plotted in @xcite and the data were given to us , thanks to prof .",
    "the differential charge distributions and isotopic distributions for @xmath89sn on @xmath37sn and @xmath36sn on @xmath37sn were theoretically calculated using @xmath90 and and also @xmath3 .",
    "so long as the temperature values at the two end points of @xmath2 are the same , the answers did not differ much .",
    "in fig.7 we have shown results for @xmath0 varying linearly with @xmath2 with @xmath91mev and @xmath92=3 mev . at each @xmath33 , the charge distribution and isotopic distributions",
    "are calculated separately and finally integrated over different @xmath33 ranges . the differential charge distributions are shown in fig.7 for different intervals of @xmath44 ranging between @xmath93 to @xmath94 , @xmath94 to @xmath95 , @xmath95 to @xmath96 , @xmath96 to @xmath97 and @xmath97 to @xmath98 . for the sake of clarity the distributions are normalized with different multiplicative factors . at peripheral collisions ( i.e. @xmath99 ) due to small temperature of the projectile spectator , it breaks into one large fragment and small number of light fragments , hence the charge distribution shows @xmath100 type nature .",
    "but with the decrease of impact parameter the temperature increases , the projectile spectator breaks into large number of fragments and the charge distributions become steeper . in figs.8 and 9",
    "the integrated isotopic distributions over the range @xmath101 for beryllium , carbon , oxygen and neon are plotted and compared with the experimental result for @xmath89sn on @xmath37sn and @xmath36sn on @xmath37sn reaction respectively .",

    "the data were made available to us by dr.mocko ( mocko , ph.d .",

    "the experimental data are from @xcite .",
    "the chief difference from results shown in @xcite is that we are able to include data for very peripheral collisions .",
