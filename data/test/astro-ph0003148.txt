    "old open clusters , with ages greater than the age of the hyades ( @xmath6 600 myr ) , represent a minority of about 80 objects among 1200 known open clusters . among their properties which enable to investigate both stellar physics and galactic structure ( reviewed by friel 1995 ) , we are especially interested in orbits because they are related to the processes which have allowed them to survive tidal forces .",
    "the statistics are still poor but it seems that old open clusters follow orbits that keep them away from the plane and the disruptive effects of giant molecular clouds . the question is to know if these orbits result from special events or represent the tail of the distribution of clusters that have already been destroyed . another relevant point to clarify is the relationship between orbits and metallicity [ fe / h ] which traces the dynamical and chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the metallicity of old open clusters is intermediate between the disk and the thick disk , with a radial gradient , but a large dispersion that could indicate an inhomogeneous enrichment of the galaxy . to answer such fundamental questions ,",
    "new observations are needed to investigate in more details the old open cluster properties and their correlations .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a spectroscopic and astrometric program to obtain metallicities , distances and velocities of high quality for several poorly known old open clusters , ngc 2355 being our first target .",
    "there are very few references on ngc 2355 in the astronomical literature .",
    "a photometric study in ubv down to @xmath7 was made by kaluzny & mazur ( 1991 ) . in this study",
    ", the reddening of the cluster was estimated to be @xmath8=0.12 mag , the distance modulus @xmath9 , the metallicity + 0.13 and the age the same as praesepe . in their search for old open clusters ,",
    "phelps et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also report a photometric study of ngc 2355 in bv but the photometry of individual stars is not given .",
    "their calibration of the index @xmath10 , defined as the magnitude difference between the main - sequence turnoff and the giant clump leads to a morphological age index corresponding to 0.9  gyr , like praesepe ( janes & phelps 1994 ) .",
    "more recently , ann et al . ( 1999 ) examined this cluster as part of the boao survey ( bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory , korea ) and determined from ubvi photometry : @xmath11}}=-0.32 , e_{b - v}=0.25 , ( m - m)_0=11.4 $ ] and an age of 1 gyr . in sect . 2 and 3 we present new data which are used to analyse the cluster in combination with the ubv photometry of kaluzny & mazur ( 1991 ) and the jhk@xmath5 photometry which is available for the whole field in the 2mass 1999 spring incremental data release .",
    "we describe the determination and analysis of proper motions from photographic plates and recent observations at the meridian circle of bordeaux ( sect .",
    "2 ) . for 24 bright stars ( @xmath12 ) around the cluster s center ,",
    "spectra were obtained with the echelle spectrograph elodie on the 193 cm telescope at the haute - provence observatory .",
    "the radial velocities of the red giants were obtained by standard on - line reduction directly at the telescope .",
    "the determination of the radial velocity and projected rotational velocity of the hot fast rotating turnoff stars required dedicated reduction tools ( sect .",
    "3 ) . in sect .",
    "4 we present our analysis of the spectra to estimate the atmospheric parameters @xmath4}}$ ] and the absolute magnitude @xmath13 . for the latter , we developed a new version of the tgmet method ( katz et al .",
    "1998 and soubiran et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we discuss the case of an unusual giant in ngc 2355 which is 2.3 magnitudes brighter than the giant clump for the same temperature .",
    "we also report the discovery of a blue straggler in the cluster and of a moving pair of field stars .",
    "5 deals with the fundamental parameters of ngc 2355 resulting from our study .",
    "our conclusions are reviewed in sect .",
    "6 . for identifying individual stars we use as far as available the star numbers introduced by kaluzny & mazur ( 1991 ) , preceded by the prefix `` km ''",
    "we determined precise proper motions for stars in the cluster region and in the surrounding field for two reasons : 1 . to enable a kinematical segregation of cluster members and non - members , and 2 . to derive the absolute tangential velocity of the cluster . in order to achieve adequate accuracy ,",
    "the proper motions were determined from observations at 3 epochs with a maximum separation of about 90 years .",
    "the first epoch , around 1910 , was provided by a triple - exposed plate from the bordeaux carte du ciel ( cdc , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) on which the cluster is favorably placed near the plate center , and by 5 plates from the bordeaux astrographic catalogue ( ac , same size , @xmath16 ) which fully or partially overlap with the field of the cdc - plate .",
    "second epoch positions were obtained by measurement of two poss - i glass copies ( o & e plates ) from the leiden observatory plate archive .",
    "the third epoch consists of observations made with the ccd meridian circle of bordeaux observatory in 1997/1998 as part of the ` mridien 2000 ' program ( see colin et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the cdc and poss plates were scanned on the mama machine at the paris observatory , the ac plates were scanned on a pds machine at the astronomical institute mnster .",
    "the scans were processed partly with the sextractor software ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and partly with our own software , in particular for the centering of the cdc triple images .",
    "all observations were reduced to the reference system of hipparcos .",
    "the meridian observations and the first - epoch plate measurements were linked directly to reference stars from the hipparcos catalogue and the act reference catalogue ( urban et al .",
    "iterative reduction schemes were used in order to make due account of the multiple observations of each star .",
    "the measurements from the poss - i plates required a separate treatment because the geometry of projection on these plates is subject to complicated and sizable distortions .",
    "thus we constructed from the first and third - epoch data an intermediary catalog of secondary reference stars .",
    "we then applied a moving - filter technique as described by morrison et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to transform the poss - i data locally and smoothly to the hipparcos system .",
    "the final proper motions were obtained by combining the positions from all epochs in a weighted linear least - squares adjustment .    according to the reduction residuals and the comparison between different observations of the same epoch , the mean accuracies of the positions are as follows : 50 mas per coordinate for the mean positions from the meridian circle observations , between 120 and 150 mas per coordinate and plate for the positions from the first - epoch plates and 150 mas per coordinate and plate for the positions from poss - i .",
    "the mean internal errors of the resulting proper motions range from @xmath17 for the brightest stars to @xmath18 for the faintest stars of the sample .    without selection according to kinematics , the distribution of the stars in the plane of the sky reveals that the cluster is centered on the position @xmath19 ( 2000.0 ) , and that its angular radius is at least @xmath20 , but probably larger . in fig .",
    "1 we present histograms of the distribution of proper motions for a circular field of @xmath3 radius around the above given position . for comparison",
    "we also show the distribution of proper motions in an annulus outside the cluster , namely between @xmath21 and @xmath22 from the center ( counts rescaled to equal surface ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the cluster stands out against the field as a concentration of comoving stars .    in order to estimate the mean proper motion of the cluster and to obtain cluster membership probabilities we fitted two - dimensional gaussians to the proper - motion distributions of the pure field sample and the cluster - and - field sample .",
    "the parameters of the distributions were determined by applying a maximum - likelihood criterion to the proper motions in the range @xmath23{\\mathrm{\\,mas\\,y}^{-1}}$ ] and @xmath24{\\mathrm{\\,mas\\,y}^{-1}}$ ] .",
    "the distribution of the field stars appears centered around @xmath25 and has a dispersion of about @xmath26 .",
    "the proper motions of the cluster stars are centered on @xmath27 , i.e. they are slightly offset from the mean proper motion of the field , and have a dispersion of @xmath28 in @xmath29 and @xmath30 in @xmath31 .",
    "the dispersion in @xmath31 is in agreement with the estimated mean proper motion errors .",
    "however it is surprising that the dispersion in @xmath32 is substantially smaller .",
    "the determination of the mean proper motion of the cluster has a statistical uncertainty of @xmath33 .",
    "to this we must add in quadrature the uncertainty of the absolute calibration of the hipparcos reference frame which is @xmath34 ( kovalevsky et al .",
    "1997 ) . with some additional allowance for other ( possibly undetected ) systematic errors in the measuring process",
    "we estimate that the accuracy of our determination of the absolute proper motion of the cluster is @xmath35 per coordinate .    using the above given parameters for the distributions of the proper motions in the cluster and the field ,",
    "individual kinematical membership probabilities were calculated .",
    "this was done in the usual way according to the relative frequency of cluster stars which the fitted model distributions predict for a given proper motion .",
    "our sample of stars in the @xmath3 circle thus divides into 38 probable cluster members ( @xmath36 ) , 13 probable field stars ( @xmath37 ) and 17 unclear cases ( @xmath38 ) .    by kinematical discrimination between cluster stars and field stars one",
    "obtains an improved picture of the structure and spatial extent of the cluster . for this purpose",
    "we chose a field of @xmath22 radius around the cluster center and selected only those stars with proper motion equal to the mean motion of the cluster within @xmath39 , i.e. the proper motion dispersion of the cluster stars .",
    "the latter criterion reduces the surface density of the field stars by a factor of 10 , but retains a sufficiently large number of cluster stars so that the cluster s structure and extent become more clearly recognizable .",
    "2 compares the radial profile of stellar density ( number counts in non - overlapping annuli around the cluster center ) with and without kinematical selection .",
    "it turns out that the cluster has a central component with exponentially decreasing density out to about @xmath3 , a halo with approximately constant density beyond @xmath3 and an edge at @xmath40 . the core radius of the cluster , i.e. the radius at which the surface density drops to half its central value , is found to be about @xmath41 .",
    "twenty - four stars with @xmath12 in the field of the cluster were observed at the haute - provence observatory in january 1999 , on the 1.93 m telescope equipped with the spectrograph elodie .",
    "this instrument is a dual - fibre - fed echelle spectrograph devoted to the measurements of accurate radial velocities ( baranne et al .",
    "1996 ) . a spectral range 390 - 680 nm is recorded in a single exposure as 67 orders on a 1k ccd at a mean resolving power of 42000 . with a one hour exposure one typically achieves a s / n of 100 on a star of magnitude 8.5 or a s / n of 10 on a star of magnitude 12.8 .",
    "elodie is a very stable instrument , allowing to compare easily spectra observed at different epochs .",
    "optimal extraction and wavelength calibration are automatically performed on - line , as well as the measurement of radial velocities by digital cross - correlation with binary templates thanks to the tacos reduction software developed by d. queloz ( 1996 ) .",
    "the cross - correlation technique is well adapted for strong - lined spectra , corresponding to moderate effective temperatures up to 6500 k. the precision of radial velocities for such spectral types is better than @xmath42 even at low signal to noise ratio . among the 24 target stars ,",
    "16 stars presented a clean deep correlation profile , permitting an accurate radial velocity and fwhm measurement directly at the telescope .",
    "the observations revealed a strong concentration of stars at @xmath43 .",
    "this is without doubt the trace of the radial motion of the cluster .",
    "thus , on the basis of radial velocity , 9 target stars were confirmed to be members of the cluster , with colours corresponding to clump giants .",
    "the mean radial velocity of this sub - sample is @xmath44 with a standard deviation of @xmath45 .",
    "the fwhm of the correlation function was for most of the stars nearly constant at @xmath46 , but slightly larger for 3 stars ( km 1 : @xmath47 , km 2 : @xmath48 , km 20 : @xmath49 ) corresponding to the signature of either macroturbulence , rotation or binarity .",
    "the radial velocities are listed in tab . 1 , together with the ubv photometry from kaluzny & mazur ( 1991 ) and the jhk@xmath5 photometry from 2mass .",
    "eight stars with bluer colour presented broad lines indicating a high rotational velocity .",
    "they could not be treated by the standard cross - correlation method . instead",
    ", their rotational profile was extracted using a least - squares deconvolution technique developed and fully described by donati et al .",
    "the latter method presents some similarities with the cross - correlation method .",
    "it is based on the fact that the observed spectrum can be expressed as the convolution product of a line pattern with a rotational plus instrumental profile .",
    "this profile can thus be recovered by deconvolving the observed spectrum with a line mask computed from a model atmosphere having the same parameters as the star .",
    "as the effective temperatures of the target stars were not known , a series of line masks with @xmath50 ranging from 6000 k to 9000 k were computed from the kurucz s database ( kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "the best contrast was obtained at @xmath51 .",
    "the deconvolution was quite difficult due to the low signal to noise ratio of the spectra but the signature of the rotation was visible for each star and confirmed a radial velocity consistent with the cluster s velocity .",
    "the next step was to calibrate the width of the deconvolved profiles in terms of @xmath52 .",
    "for this task we used several reference stars for which both a high - quality elodie spectrum and a published value of @xmath53 were available .",
    "nine stars from the tgmet library ( see next section ) were found in the catalogue of rotational velocities compiled by uesugi & fukuda ( 1982 ) , restricted to @xmath54 .",
    "the fwhm of the deconvolved profiles were measured the same way for reference and target stars by fitting a 10 degree polynomial as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 . in this example ,",
    "the same line mask corresponding to the parameters @xmath55}}= 0.0 $ ] was used for the deconvolution of the two spectra , but hd  132052 ( @xmath56 ) was observed at s / n=131 while km  13 was observed at s / n=11 . the weighted linear regression performed on the 9 points given by the reference stars led to the relation @xmath57 , represented in fig .",
    "the projected rotational velocities estimated for the 8 turnoff stars of ngc 2355 are given in column 10 of tab .",
    "1 .    the most remarkable star among those which are classified as cluster members in tab",
    ". 1 is km 1 .",
    "this is a giant which is 2.3 magnitudes brighter than the giant clump of the cluster .",
    "the fact that it is within one sigma of the cluster distribution in position , proper motion and radial velocity makes us believe that it is a cluster member and not a field star . on the other hand , we can not completely exclude the possibility that it is a projection of a field star onto the cluster because a field star at this position may by chance have the same radial velocity as the cluster . according to the formulae of the circular motion around the galactic center",
    ", a star on the line of sight to the cluster at a distance between @xmath58 and @xmath59 would have a heliocentric radial velocity between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "hence there is a certain overlap between the radial velocity distribution of the field stars and the radial velocity of the cluster .",
    "if km 1 is a member of the cluster , then it remains unclear by which phenomenon this star is considerably brighter than the other cluster giants of the same colour .",
    "we have looked for photometric variations to check if this star could be in an unstable phase of its evolution .",
    "no variations could be detected in the meridian observations over 3 years , nor in comparison with the apparent brightness on the 1950 poss - i plates and the 1910 cdc plate .",
    "km 1 is part of the tycho catalogue ( tyc 775 997 1 ) where no variability is reported .",
    "the spectrum of this peculiar star is discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "another remark is to be made on the star km 2 .",
    "this one was selected by ahumada & lapasset ( 1995 ) as a blue straggler candidate .",
    "however , its radial velocity indicates that this star is not a member of the cluster .",
    "we also point towards the stars km  20 and km  26 .",
    "these are found to be field stars with identical radial velocities of @xmath62 , despite an angular separation of @xmath63 .",

    "it was not possible to estimate spectroscopically such a high temperature with tgmet because of the limit of the library to 7500 k. the effective temperature of blue stragglers seems to correspond to a mass which is higher than that of the turnoff stars , consequently unconsistent with the age of the cluster .",
    "this phenomenon was already mentioned in the case of the red giant km  1 in sect .",
    "4 .      combining our results for the absolute proper motion , radial velocity and distance of the cluster , we determine its heliocentric space motion as @xmath79 .",
    "the uncertainties in the components of the space motion result from the combination of all estimated observational errors which were given in the previous sections . however , due to the relatively large distance of the cluster from the sun , the error budget is dominated by the uncertainty in the cluster s proper motion .    in order to obtain the velocity of the cluster in the galactocentric frame , we assume the motion of the sun in the lsr as @xmath80 , following the recent result of bienaym ( 1999 ) which is supported by similar results of e.g. dehnen & binney ( 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore we adopt the current iau standard values of @xmath81 for the local circular rotation velocity and @xmath82 kpc for the distance of the sun from the galactic center .",
    "the galactocentric position and velocity of the cluster then is @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "together with the galactic gravitational potential these vectors determine the orbit of the cluster in the galaxy .",
    "we have integrated the equations of motion in the galactic model of allen & santillan ( 1991 ) over the estimated cluster age of 1 gyr .",
    "the resulting orbit is characterized by radial oscillations between distances from the galactic center of 8.9 and 10.1  kpc and vertical oscillations with an amplitude of 350 pc .",
    "the median of the distance @xmath85 from the galactic center along the orbit is 9.6  kpc and the median of the distance @xmath86 from the galactic plane is 0.24  kpc .",
    "the cluster has made 3.7 revolutions around the galactic center and 21 crossings of the galactic disk within its lifetime .",
    "if one varies the measured space velocity of the cluster within the error bars of the observations the parameters of the orbit undergo relatively small changes .",
    "we find that the radial distances can differ by @xmath87 and the vertical distances by @xmath88 from the above given values for the ` mean orbit ' .",
    "thus we can say with certainty that the cluster keeps well outside the solar circle throughout its revolution around the galaxy .",
    "we currently observe the cluster close to its maximum distance from the plane , i.e. close to the point of reversal of the vertical oscillation .",
    "this is consistent with the characteristics of the vertical motion because the probability to find the cluster near the maximum of @xmath86 ( at a randomly chosen instant ) is about a factor of three larger than the corresponding probability for a lower value of @xmath86 .",
    "the statistics of @xmath86 along the orbit is such that the cluster spends only 9% of its time in the thin layer of the young disk population at @xmath89 where close encounters with very massive molecular clouds could have occurred .",
    "on the other hand , the orbit of ngc 2355 does not reach such extreme vertical distances as a few other old open clusters which are found at @xmath86 up to 2.4 kpc ( friel 1995 ) .",
    "thus we recognize ngc 2355 as a fairly normal representative of the old open cluster population .",
    "the latter has a scale height of 375  pc ( janes & phelps 1994 ) as compared to the scale height of 55  pc for the young population of open clusters .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of stars in the region of ngc 2355 , combining new astrometric and spectroscopic data with recent photometric data from other sources .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows :                    we thank j.guibert and the mama team at paris observatory for their support by scanning plates , r. lepoole from leiden observatory for lending the poss - i glass copies , the astronomical institute mnster for scanning time on the pds machine , and all colleagues of bordeaux observatory who have taken part in the meridian circle observations .",
