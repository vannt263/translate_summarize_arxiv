    "two sorts of brownian motion are defined by statistical physicists .",
    "translational brownian motion is the irregular motion exhibited by a massive particle as it collides with molecules in a fluid . collisions also affect the spin and orientation of particles ; theories of rotational brownian motion are concerned with the evolution of these quantities due to encounters .",
    "rotational brownian motion was first discussed by @xcite in the context of dielectric theory .",
    "the polarization of a dielectric material is a competition between torques due to the imposed field , which tend to align polar molecules , and collisions , which tend to destroy the alignment .",
    "the likely existence of black holes with masses much greater than those of stars has led to a renewed interest in brownian motion among astrophysicists @xcite .",
    "translational brownian motion of black holes in galactic nuclei may be directly observable ( e.g. @xcite ) , allowing constraints to be placed on black hole masses .",
    "translational brownian motion may also affect the rate of tidal disruption of stars by a nuclear black hole ( e.g. @xcite ) or the efficiency with which a binary black hole can interact with stars as it wanders through a nucleus @xcite .",
    "in paper i @xcite , the translational brownian motion of a massive binary was discussed ; it was shown that the amplitude of the wandering can be increased by a modest factor compared with that of a single point mass due to exchange of energy between field stars and the binary .",
    "here we consider the second kind of brownian motion experienced by a binary , the irregular variation of the orientation of the binary s spin axis due to encounters .",
    "a single field star that passes within a distance @xmath3 of the binary , with @xmath4 the binary s semi - major axis , will exchange orbital angular momentum with the binary , leading both to a change in the binary s orbital eccentricity as well as a change in the orientation of the binary s spin axis .",
    "repeated encounters will cause the binary s orbital eccentricity to evolve ( usually in the direction of increasing eccentricity ) and will also cause the orientation of the binary to undergo a random walk .",
    "the first process has been discussed extensively ( e.g. @xcite ) ; the second , discussed here for the first time , will be called rotational brownian motion , by analogy with the similar process that occurs in a fluid of polar molecules ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the orbital orientation of a black - hole binary influences the direction of the spin axis of the single black hole that forms after coalescence of the binary due to emission of gravitational radiation ( e.g. @xcite ) . the spin axis , in turn , is thought to determine the plane of the inner accretion disk which forms around the black hole @xcite , the direction of jets launched from the accretion disk @xcite , etc .",
    "thus changes in the orientation of a black - hole binary as it coalesces may have observable consequences .    in  2",
    "the conservation equations for interaction of a field star with a massive binary are presented ; most of these have been seen before and were used in earlier studies to derive the rates of change of the binary s separation and eccentricity .",
    "the rotational diffusion equation is presented in  3 and the order - of - magnitude of the rotational diffusion coefficient @xmath5 is derived .",
    " 4 describes the numerical derivation of @xmath5 from scattering experiments . @xmath6",
    "presents solutions of the diffusion equation and derives a relation between the degree of hardening of a binary and the change in its orientation .",
    "consider an encounter of a single particle ( the `` field star '' ) with a binary .",
    "assume that the binary remains bound during the encounter , appropriate if the mass of the field star is much less than the mass of each of the components of the binary or if the binary is sufficiently hard .",
    "at early times , the field star has velocity @xmath7 with respect to the center of mass of the field star - binary system and its impact parameter is @xmath8 . a long time after the encounter",
    ", the velocity @xmath9 of the field star attains a constant value .",
    "conservation of linear momentum implies that the change @xmath10 in the velocity of the binary s center of mass is given by = -12 where @xmath11 is the mass of the field star and @xmath12 is the mass of the binary .",
    "this relation was used in paper i in conjunction with scattering experiments to investigate the translational brownian motion of a binary due to encounters .",
    "the energy of the field star - binary system , expressed in terms of pre - encounter quantities , is    @xmath13    with @xmath14 the initial velocity of the binary s center of mass and @xmath15 the binary s initial semi - major axis .",
    "after the encounter , e= 12(1 + 12)v^2 - gm_1m_22a and @xmath16 , so that    @xmath17    where the latter relation assumes @xmath18 .",
    "this result was used by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to compute the hardening rate , @xmath19 , of a massive binary due to encounters .",
    "the angular momentum of the field star - binary system about its center of mass , expressed in terms of pre - encounter quantities , is _",
    "0=(1 + 12)**_0 + _",
    "12**_b0 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 the binary s spin angular momentum .",
    "conservation of angular momentum during the encounter gives    @xmath23    changes in @xmath24 correspond to changes in the binary s orbital eccentricity @xmath25 via the relation @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "changes in the direction of @xmath27 correspond to changes in the orientation of the binary , leading to rotational diffusion .",
    "let @xmath28 be the probability that the spin axis of the binary is oriented within the solid angle @xmath29 at time @xmath30 .",
    "we seek an equation describing how @xmath31 evolves with time due to encounters of field stars with the binary , if each encounter is assumed to produce a negligibly small change in @xmath32 and @xmath33 . if we imagine that @xmath22 is initially oriented parallel to the @xmath34 axis , and that the encounters leading to changes in the orientation of the binary are isotropic in velocity and direction , then @xmath31 will evolve in such a way as to remain a function of @xmath32 alone , @xmath35 .",
    "these are the same assumptions made by @xcite in his theory of the rotational brownian motion of spherical molecules .",
    "debye showed that the evolution equation for @xmath31 , in the absence of an external torque , is = 1 ( ) [ eq_evol1 ] with @xmath5 the rotational diffusion coefficient , = ( d , d)^2d ; @xmath36 is the probability that , during a unit interval of time , a binary whose angular momentum @xmath22 is directed toward @xmath29 will reorient itself such that @xmath22 lies within @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the angular separation between @xmath29 and @xmath37 .    from its definition",
    ", @xmath5 is the sum , over a unit interval of time , of @xmath39 due to encounters with field stars .",

    "specializing to the case of an equal - mass , circular - orbit binary , equation ( [ eq_diff1 ] ) becomes = 16(12)^2 _ x^2 + _ y^2g12a . [ eq_diff2 ] equation ( [ eq_diff2 ] ) is a prescription for computing the rotational diffusion coefficient from scattering experiments .",
    "this prescription will be applied in the next section .",
    "we can estimate the order of magnitude of the rotational diffusion coefficient by noting that @xmath43 , the relative velocity of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and that a single close encounter produces a change in @xmath46 of the field star of order @xmath47 .",
    "the rate of close encounters is @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 the number density and 1d velocity dispersion of the field stars ( paper i ) .",
    "thus @xmath51 and 32 where @xmath52 .",
    "the same encounters that induce rotational diffusion will also cause the binary to harden , according to equation ( [ eq_harden ] ) .",
    "the hardening rate may be written ( 1a ) = gh [ eq_defh ] with @xmath53 for a hard binary ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus [ eq_compare ] with @xmath54 .",
    "equation ( [ eq_compare ] ) suggests that rotational diffusion occurs on a time scale that is of order @xmath55 times the hardening time , or that the binary will rotate by an angle of order @xmath56 in the time it takes to harden significantly .",
    "this result will be assessed more quantitatively in  5 .",
    "the same set of scattering experiments described in paper i were used here to evaluate @xmath57 and @xmath58 . as described more fully in that paper , field stars",
    "were treated as massless particles moving in the potential of the binary whose center of mass and orbital parameters remained fixed .",
    "orbits were integrated using the routine d0p853 of @xcite , an 8(6)th order embedded runge - kutta integrator ; each field star was assumed to begin at a position @xmath59 and was advanced from @xmath60 to @xmath61 along a keplerian orbit about a point mass @xmath62 .",
    "the integrations were terminated when the star had moved a distance from the binary that was at least @xmath63 times its initial distance with positive energy .",
    "the binary s orbit was assumed to be circular ; the orientation of the binary s orbital plane with respect to the initial velocity vector of the field star , and the initial phase of the binary , were chosen randomly for each integration . unless otherwise indicated , distances and velocities are given below in program units of @xmath4 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "the orbit integrations , and the expressions given above relating changes in the field - star s angular momentum to the orientation of the binary , were checked by carrying out a limited set of experiments using a fully general , three - body integrator and various values for @xmath65 .",
    "the expressions derived above for @xmath66 etc . were found to be accurately reproduced in the limit of small @xmath65 .",
    "consider first the rotational diffusion coefficient corresponding to interactions with stars of a single velocity @xmath67 at infinity .",
    "multiplying @xmath39 in a single encounter by @xmath68 , with @xmath8 the impact parameter and @xmath49 the density of field stars , and integrating over @xmath8 gives    @xmath69    ( cf .",
    "equation [ eq_diff2 ] ) , where @xmath70 are defined as mean square changes at fixed @xmath71 , averaged over many encounters in which the orientation of @xmath72 with respect to the binary s spin axis is taken to be random .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of field - star velocity changes as a function of @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "we define a dimensionless , velocity - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath75 as    @xmath76    with @xmath77 .",
    "figure 2 plots @xmath75 as a function of @xmath67 and @xmath78 . the most effective encounters are those with small @xmath67 and @xmath78 ; encounters with impact parameters @xmath79 have a closest - approach distance to the binary of @xmath80 and produce almost no change in the binary s orientation .",
    "hence @xmath75 reaches a maximum value at @xmath81 before levelling off at larger @xmath8 .    multiplying @xmath82 by @xmath83 , the distribution of field - star velocities , and integrating @xmath84 gives @xmath5 .",
    "we assume a maxwellian distribution of field star velocities , ( v_f ) = 1(2 ^ 2)^3/2 e^-v_f^2/2_f^2 , [ max ] so that = 4(2 ^ 2)^3/2_0^ dv  v^2 e^-v^2/2 ^ 2 ^ 2",

    "@xcite ) . note that @xmath85 is a function of two parameters , @xmath88 , where r = p_max^2g12 ,  s. @xmath89 is the maximum impact parameter in units of the radius of gravitational influence of the binary and @xmath90 is the dimensionless hardness of the binary .",
    "figure 3 plots @xmath91 . at a given hardness @xmath90",
    ", @xmath85 reaches its limiting value @xmath92 by @xmath93 . for all but the softest binaries ,",
    "this limiting value is reached before @xmath94 , which is roughly the value of @xmath89 we expect for a massive binary at the center of a steeply - falling density cusp ( paper i ) .",
    "hence we ignore the dependence of @xmath85 on @xmath78 in what follows and write @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath96 varies from @xmath97 for the softest binaries ( @xmath98 ) to @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "equation ( [ eq_evol1 ] ) describes the evolution of @xmath101 , the probability distribution for the binary s orientation , given the rotational diffusion coefficient @xmath5 . the latter ( equation 20 )",
    "is a function of the binary separation @xmath4 , directly via the factor @xmath102 , and indirectly via the weak dependence of @xmath85 on binary hardness ( figure 3 ) .",
    "furthermore the timescale for the binary to reorient itself is shorter than the hardening time @xmath103 ( cf .",
    "equation [ eq_compare ] ) , hence the change in @xmath4 can not be neglected when solving for the evolution of the orientation .",
    "we nevertheless begin by considering an idealized model in which @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and the parameters @xmath104 that describe the background are assumed constant in time . the evolution equation ( [ eq_evol1 ] )",
    "becomes = 12 , where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and t_0 2(12)ga l. consider the evolution of @xmath107 , the expectation value of @xmath108 .",
    "we have      or ( ) = _ 0 e^- .",
    "hence @xmath110 is the time constant for relaxation to a uniform distribution of orientations , @xmath111 , given a fixed binary separation and unchanging stellar background .",
    "it may be expressed in physical units as t_0 = 6.110 ^ 9 yr ( 1210 ^ 6 ) ( l50)^-1 ( 10 ^ 6 ^ -3)^-1 ( 200  km  s^-1 ) ( a1  pc)^-1 .    next consider the more interesting case where @xmath4 , as well as the parameters @xmath112 and @xmath50 that describe the field stars , may be changing with time .",
    "this time dependence is not easily specified but we can make progress by changing evolution variables from @xmath30 to @xmath113 . first combining equations ( [ eq_evol1 ] ) and ( [ eq_defdv ] ) , we find = l412ga .",
    "now changing variables , = fxdxdt = fx 1adadt = -fx gha ( cf . equation ( [ eq_defh ] ) ) and so = -14 lh 12 .",
    "this equation gives the evolution of the binary s orientation in terms of changes in its semi - major axis @xmath4 , with no explicit dependence on the parameters that describe the stellar background .",
    "ignoring the weak dependence of @xmath114 and @xmath85 on @xmath4 , appropriate for a hard binary , we find as before ( a ) = _ 0(aa_0)^12lh12 .",
    "the exponent in this expression is of order @xmath115 .",
    "hence we can write ( a)1 + 12lh12(aa_0 ) where @xmath116 has been set to unity , corresponding to an initial orientation parallel to the @xmath34 axis .    for the case of binary supermassive black holes , if we define @xmath15 as the separation when the binary first forms a bound pair , we expect gravitational radiation coalescence to occur when @xmath117 @xcite . since @xmath118 for a hard binary , we find for the expectation value of @xmath108 at coalescence : 1 - 1012 .",
    "[ eq_approx ] writing @xmath119 , the rms change in the angle defined by the binary s spin axis , this becomes ,  12 . for @xmath120 ,",
    "e.g. a binary of mass @xmath121 surrounded by @xmath122 stars , this predicts @xmath123 . for a binary of so - called `` intermediate - mass '' black holes with @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "milosavljevic & merritt ( 2001 ) give information about the rotational brownian motion of a massive binary in a set of @xmath126-body simulations .",
    "they show ( in their figure 11 ) the evolution of the orientation of an equal - mass , circular - orbit binary in three simulations with @xmath127 .",
    "the simulations all follow the evolution of the binary until @xmath128 ; hence equation ( [ eq_approx ] ) predicts @xmath129 .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with the angular deflections shown in figure 11 of milosavljevic & merritt ( 2001 ) .    under what circumstances",
    "could the roeorientation angle of a supermassive black hole binary be much greater than the modest values predicted here ?",
    "since @xmath130 , one possibility is for the perturbing objects to be much more massive than @xmath122 ; for instance , they could be supergiant stars ( @xmath131 ) , star clusters ( @xmath132 ) , or giant molecular clouds ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "such physically large objects would presumably produce most of their perturbing torques when the binary separation was greater than or comparable to their own size .",
    "an even more extreme possibility is that the perturbing objects are themselves supermassive black holes .",
    "consider for example a binary supermassive black hole at the center of a giant elliptical galaxy .",
    "the stellar densities at the centers of such galaxies are low and one might expect the coalescence of the binary to stall due to a shortage of interacting stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this case , further decay of the binary might await the infall of a third and subsequent black holes from later galactic mergers ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "mass ratios @xmath65 would then be of order @xmath134 and signficant reorientation of the binary could occur before coalescence .",
    "orientations of radio jets in seyfert galaxies are known to be almost random with respect to the plane of the stellar disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if jets are launched parallel to the spin axes of rotating black holes , this implies that the spins of nuclear black holes bear almost no relation to disk spins . while the modest reorientation rates derived here are probably insufficient to explain this phenomenon , a related mechanism may suffice .",
    "the spin orientation of a supermassive black hole that forms via _ repeated _ mergers with smaller black holes would undergo a random walk due to the random orbital inclinations of the infalling black holes .",
    "if nuclear black holes in seyfert galaxies grew through multiple mergers before the formation of the stellar disks , one might expect their spin axes to be uncorrelated with those of the stars and gas .",
