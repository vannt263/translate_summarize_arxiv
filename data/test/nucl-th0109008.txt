    "the possible modification of nucleon properties in the nuclear medium is currently a much discussed topic in low energy hadron physics .",
    "one way to consider such problems is to describe the nucleon as a topological soliton and then study the influence of baryonic matter on the properties of such solitons , making use of the independent particle picture which has been so successful in describing many properties of nuclei .",
    "there exist already some works where nucleons described as skyrme  type solitons embedded in infinite nuclear matter have been considered  @xcite .",
    "the results of these studies were in qualitative agreement with experimental indications and with results of other authors using different approaches .",
    "on the quantitative level , however , there is a too large renormalization of the nucleons effective mass in nuclear matter .",
    "the quantitative value of this renormalization is about @xmath2 for the normal nuclear matter density , @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore difficult to relate this modification of the nucleon self  energy in the medium to the nucleon mass in free space because such calculations consider only the special case when a nucleon is placed in the center of the heavy nucleus .",
    "the infinite nuclear matter approach allows one only to consider properties of nucleons placed near the center of heavy nuclei where the density is constant . one can expect that taking into account non - spherical effects , i.e. deformation of the skyrmion in the finite nucleus , would improve the results also on the quantitative level",
    "density changes play an important role when the nucleon is placed at sufficiently large distances from the center of nucleus .",
    "the role of deformation effects ( for an early work see  @xcite ) has already been investigated in connection with the nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction in ref .",
    "the results presented in this work demonstrated the necessity of non - spherical deformed solutions of the field equations to obtain a reliable description of the @xmath4 potential . a similar approach to the deformation for two interacting skyrmions has been used in the work  @xcite , where changes in the nucleon shape are investigated by letting the nucleon deform under the strong interactions with another nucleon . on the other hand , rotational and vibrational excitations of deformed skyrmions",
    "have also been considered for baryon number equal to one ( @xmath5 ) system  @xcite . in a series of papers  @xcite axially symmetric few  skyrmion systems with baryon number",
    "@xmath6 larger than one were investigated , because spherically symmetric configurations in the skyrme model do not give bound skyrmionic systems  @xcite even for the solutions of the model within the finite nuclei as considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for similar or related work , see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the works  @xcite the deformation",
    "is introduced by a modification of the unit spherical vector and additionally through the modification of the profile function  @xcite in the expression of the ansatz for the chiral field ( for more precise definitions , see below ) .",
    "the results of all investigations for @xmath7 systems lead to the conclusion that the system has to be deformed to obtain the ground state .",
    "some other papers that deal with deformation effects and non - spherical configurations are collected in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work we consider properties of the deformed nucleon embedded in light , medium  heavy and heavy nuclei .",
    "deformation effects are introduced by the distortion of the profile function of chiral field under the action of the external field ( which parameterizes the baryonic density within a given nucleus ) .",
    "in contrast to most previous investigations , we do not consider a constant nuclear density as appropriate for nuclear matter but rather the distance - dependent density as given for finite nuclei .",
    "we calculate the modifications of the nucleon properties in finite nuclei , and their dependence on the distance between the topological center of the skyrmion inside the nucleus and the geometrical center of the nucleus under consideration will be considered .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "after the formulation of the problem in section  [ sec : form ] , we discuss the classical soliton mass and distribution of baryon charge for a skyrmion inside finite nuclei in section  [ sec : mass ] . based upon the results for the mass and baryon charge distribution of the deformed classical soliton , we present in section  [ sec : quant ] the quantization of axially symmetric systems with baryon number @xmath5 .",
    "section  [ sec : prop ] is devoted to the quantum properties of the solitons , in particular the effective mass of nucleons in finite nuclei and the consequences for @xmath0 mass splittings .",
    "we also consider the density dependence of the nucleons electromagnetic radii and calculate the intrinsic quadrupole moment of the deformed nucleon .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] the conclusions and an outlook for further investigations are given .",

    "nucleon scattering lengths and the nuclear density @xmath19 : @xmath20 here , @xmath16 has the meaning of the pion dipole susceptibility of the medium .",
    "the influence of the medium enters through these functionals ( for explicit expressions , see section  [ sec : sus ] ) .",
    "note that we employ here the same approximations as in  @xcite .",
    "since the fourth order term can be obtained from the infinite mass limit of @xmath21 meson exchange , a possible density dependence of that term could enter via in  medium modified @xmath21 meson properties as it was done e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "similarly , one could add a sixth order term @xmath22 arising from @xmath23 meson exchange or an symmetric fourth order term due to scalar mesons .",
    "we do not consider such terms here .",
    "also , since the empirical information on possible changes of vector meson properties in the medium has not yet lead to an established picture , we treat the coupling @xmath11 as a density independent number .",

    "these modifications are dictated by the topological properties of the model , in particular the @xmath36 dependence is dictated by the constraint that the baryon number is larger than one , @xmath7 .",

    "obviously these deformation effects also exist in the case when a skyrmion is placed at the center of nucleus , @xmath42 , but in this case the deformation has only a radial dependence . in the previous work  @xcite this dependence",
    "was determined by solving the equations for the profile function of the ansatz  ( [ anzsph ] ) in nuclear matter , @xmath43 .",
    "it is clear that in the present case the deformation has in general both a radial and an angular dependence .",
    "the angular dependence will come into play when the skyrmion is located at some distance from the center of the nucleus .",

    "for example , one expects that an intrinsic quadrupole moment of the skyrmion emerges .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail below .    before discussing the in - medium skyrmion properties ,",
    "we point out that throughout this paper we neglect the effects due to fermi motion of the solitons ( nucleons ) . in a strict large-@xmath45 counting ,",
    "such effects are suppressed . however , since we do not expect deformation effects to be large , one can doubt the validity of this formal suppression . at present , it is simply not known how to include such effects systematically because one not only would we have to boost the solitons ( where the boost velocity could be obtained in the local density approximation ) but also the coupling to the rotational modes would considerably complicate the quantization procedure to obtain physical states . while the neglect of fermi motion might to some extent alter the quantitative results of our study , we believe , however , that the qualitative ones would remain unaltered .",

    "we do not show the results of such calculations here because the calculation could be further refined .",
    "if one uses e.g. the shell structure of the nuclei , then all nucleons will be situated at some distances ( within the shells ) from their mass center and the mean effective value of the nucleon mass in such systems will be further reduced for nucleons in heavy nuclei .",

    "similarly , the isovector root - mean - square radii ( normalized to the isovector charge ) , @xmath211 , are determined by the zeroth component of the vector current @xmath205 @xmath212 where @xmath213\\,.\\ ] ] one can see that the influence of the medium enters indirectly via the modified profile functions .",
    "results for the in  medium radii are collected in table  [ table ] .",
    "we give the isoscalar @xmath214 and isovector @xmath215 root - mean - square radii of the nucleons along the @xmath216 and @xmath128 axes inside the nuclei @xmath94o , @xmath96fe and @xmath97au , evaluated in the center of each nucleus and at those distances where the intrinsic quadrupole moment of the nucleons has its first and second extremum , correspondingly ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "we note that due to the axial symmetry @xmath217 .",
    "clearly , these radii swell , as first pointed out in ref.@xcite in the analysis of data on quasi - elastic electron - nucleus scattering . however , this swelling is not isotropic and depends very sensitively on the distance from the center of the nucleus .",
    "the concept of a common swelling by one scale factor is certainly much too simple .",
    "our results are therefore not in contradiction with the y - scaling analysis of ref.@xcite ( see also the discussion in @xcite on this issue ) .",
    "as noted before due to the deformation the nucleon can have a nonvanishing _ intrinsic _ quadrupole moment  @xcite @xmath218 that is characterized by the third component @xmath163 of the angular momentum in the body - fixed frame of reference .",
    "the corresponding isoscalar and isovector intrinsic quadrupole moments follow from ( [ isosr ] ) and ( [ isovr ] ) by appropriate projection @xmath219 consequently , the proton and neutron intrinsic quadrupole moments follow from @xmath220 the dependence of the isoscalar and isovector intrinsic quadrupole moments as a function of @xmath221 is shown in fig .",
    "again we present results only for the nuclei @xmath94o , @xmath96fe and @xmath97ag . for the other nuclei the dependences are similar .",
    "one can see that intrinsic quadrupole moments are small .",
    "this smallness of the intrinsic quadrupole moments means that nucleons in the nucleus are weakly deformed .",
    "the intrinsic quadrupole moments has two extrema .",
    "near the center of nucleus they have negative values and a corresponding minimum at that distances where density changes are @xmath12420% for @xmath94o and @xmath1247% for @xmath96fe and @xmath97au , respectively .",
    "then with increasing density the intrinsic quadrupole moments become positive and have a maximum at the distance where the density of the nucleus has fallen by @xmath222% .",
    "note also that the isoscalar intrinsic quadrupole moment is about two times smaller than the isovector one . consequently near the center of the nucleus protons",
    "are flattened along the axis @xmath128 ( oblate ) and and near the border of the nucleus they are extended ( prolate ) .",
    "in contrast neutrons near the center of nucleus slightly prolate and near the border of nucleus oblate . consequently , at some intermediate distance the nucleons must have spherical form .",
    "finally , let us recall that the observable static quadrupole moment in the laboratory system of an intrinsically deformed baryon in an isotropic background is linked to its intrinsic quadrupole moment by the wigner - eckhardt theorem   as follows  @xcite @xmath223 where the relations are valid for maximally projected states with @xmath224 .",
    "thus for a deformed baryon of total angular momentum @xmath225 the quadrupole moment in the _ laboratory _ system is zero for its ground state , i.e.  for the nucleon .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the transition quadrupole moments to excited states , extending the work of @xcite . as mentioned before",
    ", our case corresponds to a deformed baryon in an unisotropic background .",
    "a simple projection to the laboratory system is therefore not possible .",
    "in summary , we have considered properties of a nucleon embedded in finite nuclei making use of the skyrme model .",
    "deformation effects are taken into account by the distortion of chiral profile function under the action of the nuclear medium , parameterized in terms of the functionals eq.([funcrho ] ) .",
    "nucleons and deltas emerge as quantized solitons after performing an adiabatic rotation in co - ordinate and isospace which takes into account the axial symmetry of the system ( leading to two different moments of inertia , @xmath226 .",
    "the main results of this study can be summarized as follows :    * the density dependence of the nucleon mass shows a more realistic behavior than in the case of a uniform density as e.g. for homogeneous nuclear matter .",
    "the effective nucleon mass has its minimum at the center of the nucleus and approaches its free space value at the surface of the nucleus . *",
    "the nucleons in finite nuclei are weakly deformed .",
    "they acquire a small intrinsic quadrupole moment which , however , is strongly dependent on the distance from the center of the nucleus , e.g. the proton ( neutron ) deformation changes from a oblate ( prolate ) to a prolate ( oblate ) form as it is moved toward the surface of the nucleus . *",
    "similarly , there is a direction - dependent swelling of the isoscalar and isovector root - mean - square radii .",
    "we have stressed that the concept of a uniform swelling factor is too simple a concept to apply to real nuclei . * as consequence of the axial symmetry of the system , the @xmath227 @xmath0 states ( @xmath228 ) and the @xmath229 ones ( @xmath230 ) have slightly different masses in finite nuclei .",
    "let us briefly give an outlook for further studies based on these results . as it was mentioned above this approach can be used for model investigations of the shell structure of nuclei and to study the properties of a remote nucleon in such a system ( halo nuclei ) . in the latter case the nucleon in the finite nucleus",
    "should not be considered as one within the nucleus but weakly coupled to the nucleus at large distances .",
    "also , the model naturally allows to study nucleon properties in the lightest nuclei , especially the electromagnetic structure of nucleons in @xmath231he , which is of current experimental interest .",
