    "the past few years have witnessed significant progress in the building of realistic inflation models within string theory @xcite .",
    "the most popular approach has used the interaction potential between branes and antibranes as the source of energy driving inflation ; hence the interbrane separation plays the role of the inflaton .",
    "early attempts suffered from the assumption that moduli could be fixed by fiat , without specifying the stabilization mechanism .",
    "however , explicit examples have shown that properly fixing the moduli can interfere with the flatness which is required for the inflaton potential @xcite ( ) .",
    "flux compactifications in type iib string theory have provided a robust way of stabilizing the dilaton and complex structure moduli of the calabi - yau manifold @xcite , with the added benefit of providing warped throats @xcite which can be useful for tuning the scale of inflation or of the standard model .",
    "nonperturbative effects have been plausibly invoked to stabilize the remaining khler moduli @xcite .",
    "this last step , unfortunately , generically spoils whatever flatness of the inflaton potential which was accomplished by warping , and thus requires additional fine tuning of parameters .",
    "one can introduce extra parameters associated with corrections to the superpotential , which must be tuned to a part in 100 in order to obtain the minimum amount of 60 e - foldings of inflation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to tune parameters already present within the model but at the level of a part in 1000 @xcite .",
    "the fine - tuning problem of the  model has been considered by several authors @xcite .",
    "shift symmetry of the lagrangian has been proposed as a possible solution @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out that if lyman @xmath1 constraints are viewed with skepticism , the degree of tuning required is considerably relaxed @xcite . of course , this observation also applies to other models of inflation .    in this paper",
    "we reexamine the fine - tuning issue , starting within the context of the original  potential , without introducing additional corrections .",
    "a closer consideration of the potential between the brane and antibrane reveals the importance of a parameter ( which we call @xmath0 ) which was set to a certain value in .",
    "it is the distance which the brane will travel before annihilating with the antibrane in the warped throat , assuming that the brane starts somewhere closer to the the interior of the calabi - yau at an initial position @xmath2 .",
    "the other important parameters governing the shape of the inflaton potential are the warp factor of the throat , which we denote as @xmath3 , and the khler modulus at its stabilized value , @xmath4 .",
    "the warp factor is tunable through the ratio of ns - ns and rr fluxes @xmath5 : @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the vev of the khler modulus @xmath4 is determined by the nonperturbative superpotential @xmath7 invoked by ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath8 in the case of gluino condensation in an @xmath9 gauge theory sector which can naturally arise in these compactifications .",
    "if the parameter @xmath0 is set to zero as in , then indeed it is necessary to introduce additional sources of dependence on the inflaton into the potential , in order to cancel the unwanted contribution to the inflaton mass coming from the khler modulus .",
    "however , in this work we point out that for a range of values @xmath10 of the combination @xmath11 , it is possible to achieve 60 or more e - foldings of inflation without any additional corrections to the potential",
    ". fortunately this restriction on @xmath12 applies only to the simplest  model .",
    "we will show that the restriction disappears when one considers more general examples in which corrections to the khler and superpotentials are taken into account .",
    "another crucial parameter which we consider is the number of mobile mobiles branes , @xmath13 , generalizing the simplest case of only a single brane playing the role of the inflaton .",
    "we refer to this possibility as multibrane inflation . within the aforementioned range of @xmath12 values",
    ", we observe a very interesting phenomenon , whereby starting with a sufficiently large number @xmath13 dynamically leads to a sufficiently flat inflaton potential . at large @xmath13 ,",
    "the branes start out being confined in a metastable minimum of the potential .",
    "but as successive branes tunnel out of this minimum , it becomes shallower , until finally all the remaining branes can roll together into the throat .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the potential is often very flat when the branes start rolling , leading to a long period of inflation .",
    "this is a novel , dynamical mechanism for flattening the inflaton potential , which appears to be quite specific to brane - antibrane inflation .",
    "before looking at the dynamics of inflation with stacks of branes and antibranes , we consider under what conditions multiple branes are compatible with the stabilization of the extra dimensions , _",
    "i.e. , _ the khler modulus , @xmath4 , in supergravity language . for each extra brane",
    "we have to introduce a corresponding antibrane such that the tadpole cancellation condition is statisfied . adding antibranes lifts the local minimum of the potential by an additional amount , given by the sum of their tensions , reduced by the warp factor at their location in the bottom of the klebanov - strassler throat .",
    "there is a critical number of antibranes that can be added such that the potential still has a local minimum along the @xmath4 direction and therefore the khler modulus remains stable .",
    "the stronger the warping , the larger the number of antibranes that can be added . in our analysis",
    "we will add antibranes such that the khler modulus remains stabilized and heavy .",
    "thus it does not act like a second inflaton field , since it changes very little during the slow - rolling of the brane - antibrane separation @xmath14 .",
    "not all models are suitable for constructing such a multi - brane setup .",
    "we will give here two examples , one which works and one which does not .",
    "the original kklt @xcite setup does not accommodate a large number of mobile branes ; just one additional antibrane is sufficient to lift the vacuum from anti - desitter ( ads ) to minkowski ( or desitter , ds ) .",
    "the barrier that prevents tha khler modulus from rolling has a height roughly equal to the depth of the ads minimum .",
    "addind a second brane lifts the potential by an amount that is roughly equal to the height of the barrier , which destroys the local minimum . in figure [ fig1n ]",
    "we take the parameters of the potential and the antibrane tension as given by @xcite .",
    "one sees that adding a second brane results in a very shallow minimum and three branes destabilizes the khler modulus .",
    "the potential of the khler modulus is given by v = aae^-a ( 13aa e^-a + w_0 + a e^-a)+nd^3 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "-0.25 cm     and @xmath19 antibranes , showing there can be at most 2 antibranes without destabilizing the khler modulus .",
    "[ fig1n ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the situation is dramatically improved if one uses a racetrack superpotential as in ref .",
    "the minimum is already minkowski and adding antibranes in a highly warped throat lifts the vacuum to ds without destabilizing the khler modulus .",
    "the potential is : & & v= e^-2(a+b)6 ^ 2(b b e^a+ a a e^b ) + & & + where we choose the same parameters as in @xcite , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . with these values",
    "the critical number of branes turns out to be @xmath22 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2n ]    , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the remaining analysis , we will not be concerned with the particular model of khler modulus stabilization , beyond the assumption that it admits the required number of additional branes .",
    "it will also be found that a large number is not required , so the racetrack model mentioned here is sufficient to establish the existence of a viable model .",
    "our starting point for the dynamics of inflation is the lagrangian for the mobile brane position @xmath14 in the  framework . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we will assume that all moduli ( notably the khler modulus @xmath4 ) are heavy except for the inflaton , and that the 4d effective cosmological constant vanishes at the end of inflation . the lagrangian can be parametrized as [ lag ]",
    "l = 6r^2 ^ 2 - tr^2(1 + ( -_0)^4)^-1 where @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 is related to the tension @xmath25 of the 3-brane or antibrane by @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 is the warp factor , @xmath14 is the 3-brane position , and @xmath0 is the location of the antibrane . to keep our work self - contained ,",
    "this expression is derived in appendix a , in just the same way as in except for the omission of two approximations : ( 1 ) we do not assume that @xmath28 , and ( 2 ) we do not taylor - expand the term @xmath29 .",
    "let us first comment on point ( 1 ) above .",
    "in  and certain other investigations of brane - antibrane inflation , it was assumed that inflation takes place sufficiently far from the antibrane to justify the approximation @xmath30 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 parameter was kept in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "physically , it may be important to allow for nonzero @xmath0 because of the possibility that the @xmath14-dependence coming from the @xmath31 factor in the potential will tend to stabilize the brane at some point other than the bottom of the warped throat , in the absence of the brane - antibrane interaction .",
    "an example where this is particularly clear is that of two symmetrically placed warped throats , each with its own antibrane @xcite . in that case",
    "the potential ( translated to our notation ) was taken to be v = tr^2(2 - ( -_0)^4 - ( + _ 0)^4 ) from symmetry considerations it is obvious in this model that there exists a metastable or unstable equilibrium point exactly midway between the two throats , at @xmath32 , which can not coincide with the bottom of either throat .",
    "if we simply remove one of the throats , the result corresponds to our starting point ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "the presence or absence of the @xmath0 parameter explains differences in the amount of required fine - tuning of the potential found in different investigations . to elucidate this ,",
    "recall that the @xmath14-dependence in the volume modulus @xmath33 is the origin of the @xmath34 problem pointed out in the mass of the inflaton is of order @xmath35 in planck units , ruining the slow roll condition .",
    "it was noticed by @xcite that it is possible to tune parameters of a model with a potential similar to that in ( [ lag ] ) so that the slow - roll conditions are satisfied , even without adding any extra @xmath14-dependent corrections to the superpotential , by varying only the parameters which already appear .",
    "however , the degree of tuning needed was more severe than in where corrections to the superpotential were invoked .",
    "one way of understanding this is to realize that if @xmath36 and only corrections of order @xmath37 are added , then the potential automatically has @xmath38 , so that one of the slow roll parameters @xmath39 is small without any tuning .",
    "then only the @xmath34 parameter ( @xmath40 ) needs to be tuned . in our potential",
    "however , both slow - roll parameters must be tuned , for generic parameters in the potential . in @xcite",
    "it was found that 60 e - foldings of inflation could be obtained by tuning the warp factor to one part in 2000 , whereas  only needed one part in 100 tuning .",
    "although this sounds contrary to the spirit of the present paper , it was due to the fact that no systematic study of the effect of varying @xmath0 was done in @xcite ; instead only one fixed value was considered .",
    "we note that the behavior of the potential as @xmath41 is classically correct , since by derivation it is of the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 satisfies @xmath44 in the 6d calabi - yau manifold .",
    "although the full brane position must be specified by 3 complex @xmath14 coordinates , we are keeping the angular ones fixed and following only the radial coordinate for the brane - antibrane separation .",
    "we also comment on our choice of avoiding the second approximation ( point ( 2 ) above ) , by not taylor expanding @xmath45 .",
    "we choose not to do so because there is no advantage in making this expansion ",
    "it only leads to an unphysical divergence in the potential energy as the brane - antibrane distance shrinks .",
    "the unexpanded form has good behavior as @xmath46 , including the vanishing of the potential at the minimum .",
    "we will be interested below in the generalization to more than one brane rolling .",
    "the lagrangian for @xmath13 branes and @xmath13 antibranes is [ lagm ]",
    "l = 6r^2_i=1^n_i^2 - ntr^2(1 + _ i=1^n(_i-_0)^4)^-1 where now the volume modulus is r = 2- _ i=1^n_i^2 later we will specialize to the situation where all the branes are coincident , @xmath47 . then the potential takes the form @xmath48 .",
    "the optimal potential for achieving slow roll inflation is one where both the first and second derivatives vanish simultaneously at some critical point @xmath49 .",
    "although this requires fine tuning , we will discuss a mechanism where the tuning can automatically occur through a dynamical process . to characterize the tuning , we introduce new parameters a & = & n_0 ^ 4 , b^2 = 2_0 ^ 6 , x = _ 0 such that the potential is proportional to [ hatv ] v(x ) = 1(b^2/ a - x^2)^2 ( 1 + a(x-1)^4)^-1 the conditions for the potential to have a flat point , as defined above , are [ crit ] a = ( 6x-1)(x-1)^4 , 5x^2(x-1)^4 = b^2    these equations can be solved analytically , as the solution of a cubic equation , but the expression is not very enlightening .",
    "instead we give an approximate description , by first considering @xmath12 as a free parameter , and determining as a function of @xmath12 the critical values @xmath50 and @xmath51 which satisfy ( [ crit ] ) . for consistency",
    ", we should also require that @xmath52 ; otherwise the potential blows up at @xmath53 , before the brane reaches the antibrane .",
    "the range of values where @xmath54 ( obviously also required for a physically sensible solution ) and @xmath55 turns out to be rather narrow , [ range ] 0.259 < b < 0.286 , and in this region @xmath50 is to a good approximation a linear function of @xmath12 : [ ac ] a_c 3b - 0.77 one can also approximate the critical value @xmath51 by a quadratic form , @xmath56 .",
    "we will show later that the narrowness of the interval ( [ range ] ) is an accident , in the sense that physically well - motivated perturbations to the potential can remove this restriction",
    ". therefore we will ultimately not regard it as a fine tuning .",
    "however the special value @xmath50 for a given value of @xmath12 clearly does represent a fine tuning of the parameters .",
    "it is this condition which will be addressed by a dynamical mechanism .",
    "namely , by starting with a large enough number @xmath13 of branes , one can initially have @xmath57 ( but still @xmath58 ) .",
    "the potential always has a metastable minimum from which branes can tunnel in this case .",
    "after each tunneling event , the value of @xmath59 diminishes by a discrete amount . at some critical number of branes , @xmath60 ,",
    "the curvature changes so that the branes roll instead of being trapped .",
    "it becomes a quantitative question , depending on the values of @xmath4 and @xmath27 , whether the potential is sufficiently flat to give enough inflation .",
    "we will show that in fact it is almost always flat enough to give at least 60 e - foldings of inflation .    to find out how likely it is that adequate inflation will occur ,",
    "we have explored the parameter space @xmath61 , subject to the aforementioned restrictions and the assumption that @xmath13 starts out being larger than the critical value , where all the branes start to roll . for each value of @xmath62 , the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath60 are determined .",
    "the fields start from rest at the value where the potential has a local minimum with @xmath63 branes , on the assumption that the nontunneling branes do not move during the tunneling event .",
    "the equations of motion are = -3h_i - v_i , = h for the canonical momentum _",
    "i = 12r^2_i and number of e - foldings @xmath64 , where the hubble parameter is given by @xmath65 . since all the fields move together , we need consider only one equation for the inflatons , which we do numerically .",
    "the result is that , for @xmath12 satisfying ( [ range ] ) , there is a high probability of getting enough inflation , for random values of @xmath66 selected from within a reasonable range , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "scanning uniformly over this region , we find that @xmath69 of tries result in more than 55 e - foldings of inflation when @xmath70 , and an even greater percentage occurs for other values of @xmath12 .",
    "the results are illustrated for @xmath70 in figure [ fig2 ] , showing the number of e - foldings , @xmath71 ( omitting values where @xmath72 for clarity ) versus @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    in figure [ fig2 ] it can be seen that @xmath71 is constant along lines of constant @xmath75 .",
    "this can be understood by rewriting the potential in terms of the canonically normalized field @xmath76 : v = tna^3 ( 1 - 16 ^ 2)^-2 ( 1 - 36(n / a)^3(-_0)^4)^-1 where @xmath77",
    ". thus for fixed @xmath12 , the shape of the potential , power spectrum , and duration of inflation depend only upon combination of parameters in @xmath78 , and not on the orthogonal combination @xmath79 .",
    "we can therefore restrict our exploration of parameter space to a one - dimensional scan along the direction of @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , we can show that the number of branes @xmath13 depends in a very simple way on the value of @xmath78 : @xmath80 .",
    "this follows from eliminating @xmath0 from the definitions of @xmath59 and @xmath12 .",
    "therefore the critical number of branes is given by [ nc ] n_c = a_c b^-4/3 ( 2)^2/3 ^ 1/3 and for a fixed value of @xmath12 , we can treat the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath60 interchangeably .",
    "of course ( [ nc ] ) ca nt be satisfied exactly , because @xmath60 has to be an integer .",
    "the accidental discrepancies between the optimal value of @xmath60 and the closest integer below this value will affect how long inflation actually lasts .",
    "= 0.5    in figure [ fig3 ] we show the correlation between number of e - foldings and the critical number of branes , scanning uniformly in the interval @xmath81 of parameter space .",
    "although the two quantities are generally correlated , there are order - of - magnitude variations in @xmath71 over narrow ranges of @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] demonstrates that both features can be matched fairly well by an empirical relationship .",
    "let @xmath82 be the discrepancy between the ideal value of @xmath60 and the closest integer below this value .",
    "then we find that [ emp ] n_e 10 n_c the factor @xmath83 , is understandable since if @xmath84 , the potential is tuned to be perfectly flat at some position @xmath85 .",
    "= 0.5    the factor @xmath86 in ( [ emp ] ) can be partly understood in terms of assisted inflation @xcite . with @xmath13 fields rolling simultaneously",
    ", the kinetic term is multiplied by @xmath13 relative to one field .",
    "we should rescale the fields by @xmath87 , and the slow - roll parameters by @xmath88 .",
    "one therefore expects an enhancement in the length of inflation by some power of @xmath60 .",
    "it would of course be satisfying to understand why that power is @xmath89 in the present model .",
    "we have not yet succeeded in analytically deriving this result .",
    "however it is not surprising that @xmath71 fails to be enhanced by a full factor of @xmath60 as would be the case for ordinary assisted inflation , because the potential contains @xmath90 in the khler modulus .",
    "only if the potential was independent of @xmath13 would we be sure that @xmath91 . in that case , transforming to the canonically normalized field would cause @xmath92 and the slow roll parameters would go like @xmath93 .",
    "the surprise is that there is any assisted inflation effect at all .",
    "the reason for it is that at the critical value of @xmath13 , the potential is flatter than it would generically be for an arbitrary function of @xmath90 .",
    "the above results were for @xmath70 .",
    "allowing @xmath12 to vary , ones finds that smaller @xmath12 tends to give more inflation with a smaller number of branes .",
    "this dependence is shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the main observation , though , is that the great majority of all cases yield more than @xmath94 e - foldings of inflation .",
    "in addition to having a long enough period of inflation , we must obtain a spectrum of density perturbations in agreement with observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background . to compute the power spectrum , we use the following expression @xcite which applies to a set of noncanonically normalized fields with lagrangian @xmath95 : p(k ) = v75 ^ 2 m_p^2 n_e^i n_e^j g^ij = n_c v h^275 ^ 2 m_p^2 r6 ^ 2 these quantities",
    "are evaluated at horizon crossing of the relevant wave number , when @xmath96 . to normalize the spectrum",

    "the cobe normalization implies that @xmath99 for these modes .",
    "this allows us to normalize the scale of the potential by fixing the value of the parameter @xmath24 which is proportional to the unwarped brane tension .",
    "the results are expressed in terms of the scale of inflation relative to the planck scale . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we plot @xmath100 as a function of the number of branes .",
    "( in the previous section it was explained that , just like @xmath71 , spectral properties depend only on the same combination of @xmath4 and @xmath27 which determine @xmath60 . ) from the figure one sees that the inflationary scale ranges between @xmath101 and @xmath102 , roughly consistent with our assumption of @xmath103 e - foldings of inflation .",
    "the string scale , which determines the brane tension , must be in about the same range .",
    "if the number of branes is small enough , the inflationary scale can be sufficiently high for the tensor contribution to the cosmic microwave background to be observable in future experiments .",
    "= 0.5    the scalar spectral index is given by @xmath104 .",

    "it is most conveniently displayed as a function of the number of branes .",
    "the deviation @xmath105 at 55 e - foldings before the end of inflation is shown as a function of @xmath60 in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "there is a wide range of possible values , @xmath106 .",
    "= 0.5    it is also interesting to consider the running of the spectral index , @xmath107 , for which wmap has given a hint of a larger - than - expected negative value , @xmath108 @xcite .",

    "generically , within the slow - roll formalism , one expects @xmath109 , which is usually smaller than the measured central value .",
    "our numerical survey shows that it is possible to have rare instances of running as negative as @xmath110 , even though inflation lasts long enough .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fig7 ] , it is still true that @xmath109 .",
    "the rare cases of large running correspond to occasional extreme values of the spectral index .",

    "the previous analysis shows that within a narrow range of the parameter @xmath123 , a long period of inflation will always ensue , as long as the initial number of mobile branes exceeded the critical number @xmath60 .",
    "but since @xmath12 looks fine - tuned , this is not a complete solution to the problem of naturalness for the inflaton potential .",
    "could this be an accident of the particular form of the simplest potential ? to answer this , we explore the effect of perturbing the model by corrections which are expected to be present , but which we have so far ignored for the sake of simplicity .    at least two kinds of modifications to the basic  model are generically expected : corrections to the superpotential and to the khler potential .",
    "a simple example of the former was considered in @xcite , where the superpotential for the khler modulus @xmath124 and inflaton was taken to be w = w_0 + g(t)(1 + ^2 ) leading to a contribution to the potential of the form [ deltav ] v = + ^2 + ^4 ( 2- ^2)^2 with @xmath4-dependent coefficients @xmath125 .",
    "this should be added to the brane - antibrane potential which we have been using so far . in the case of @xmath13 branes , we take @xmath126 . to simplify the analysis , we consider examples where @xmath125 are chosen in such a way that the full potential continues to have a global minimum at @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is assumed to vanish : v ~n we have included the factors of @xmath13 appropriate to the multibrane case , when all branes are coincident .",
    "the second kind of correction involves the khler potential , which for @xmath13 branes was taken to be @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "this was always understood to be an approximate expression , good when @xmath130 , but subject to higher order corrections in @xmath131 , for example @xmath132 .",

    "the kinetic term @xmath136 also gets @xmath137 corrections , which can be inferred from eq.([kmetric ] ) , but these are negligible whenever the branes are slowly rolling .    by the above reasoning , the two kinds of corrections enter into the rescaled potential ( [ hatv ] ) as [ newhatv ] v ( c(x^2 - 1)^2 + ( 1 + a(x-1)^4)^-1 ) by experimenting with this generalized potential , one finds that the new coefficient @xmath138 allows for the removal of the lower bound on @xmath12 in ( [ range ] ) .",
    "moreover , negative values of @xmath139 can remove the upper bound .",
    "it is easy to find values of @xmath138 and @xmath139 for which the potential has the desired behavior as a function of @xmath13 , as in figure [ fig1 ] , regardless of the value of @xmath12 .",

    "the large-@xmath12 model also has @xmath147 for most realizations , but for rare cases with @xmath148 , it is possible to get large deviations from a flat spectrum with @xmath149 .",
    "these are accompanied by sizable running , but as in figure [ fig8 ] , such points occur outside of the experimentally allowed region .",
    "the overall conclusion is that the generalized models have similar qualitative behavior to the simplest class which was studied in sections iii - iv .",
    "in this work we have presented a very general means whereby a long period of inflation , with a suitably flat spectrum of density perturbations , can be automatically obtained after tunneling of branes , from a metastable position in a calabi - yau manifold , into a warped throat containing antibranes .",
    "it depends only on the fact that the brane - antibrane potential generically has such a metastable minimum when the number of branes is sufficiently large , and the possibility of starting at a place in the string theory landscape where the number of mobile branes exceeds the threshold for having a minimum .",
    "once a certain critical number of branes @xmath60 is reached , the minimum disappears and the branes start rolling slowly to the true minimum .",
    "they automatically start from the same position , which is guaranteed to be close to the flattened region of the potential .    in this scenario , an arbitrarily long time will be spent in a metastable de sitter phase resembling old inflation , before the slow rolling period ( similarly to ref .",
    "each tunneling event results in a small bubble of open universe , within which another period of quasi - de sitter expansion will occur .",
    "the process repeats itself until the critical number of branes is reached . for us , these long periods of old inflation are irrelevant  we have focused entirely on the final phase of conventional inflation associated with the smooth motion of the branes until they annihilate with antibranes in the throat , hopefully leading to the reheating of the universe @xcite , and perhaps the production of cosmic superstrings @xcite .",
    "we numerically scanned over large ranges of the logarithm of relevant combinations of parameters which govern the shape of the inflaton potential , and found that large fractions ( @xmath150 ) of the trials resulted in inflation with no need for tuning , whenever the flattening mechanism could occur .",
    "this seems to be a quite promising approach for ameliorating the need for fine - tuning within the framework of the string - theory landscape @xcite .    for convenience of numerical integration , we chose a form of the potential which has good behavior as the branes reach the bottom of the throat .",
    "this form , which differs from the commonly used taylor - expanded form , is in fact the result of a direct perturbative computation , and does not require any special assumptions .",
    "however , the perturbative derivation does assume that @xmath151 in order to be valid .",
    "one might therefore wonder how sensitive our results are to the behavior of the potential when this approximation is breaking down .",
    "we have investigated what happens if the taylor expansion @xmath152 is used in place of @xmath153 , and we also checked different ways of regulating the singularity , like @xmath154 .",
    "for all these alternatives , we found that although the specific parameter values where a flat potential occurs may be somewhat sensitive to the behavior of the potential near @xmath0 , the mechanism of multibrane inflation nevertheless works in the same way as we have presented .",
    "we therefore believe it to be a robust result , which is qualitatively quite different from field theory models of inflation .",
    "although the dynamical flattening of the potential requires a rather special range of parameters in the simplest  model , we showed that this restriction can be lifted once corrections to the superpotential and the khler potential are taken into account .",
    "we exhibited an example of such corrections that works , without systematically exploring the parameter space of such corrections .",
    "subjectively , it seems that the parameter space ( referred to as @xmath155 in section v ) where multibrane inflation works will be large , given that it was easy to find a successful example , but a more complete investigation could be made .",
    "moreover , such corrections should in principle be computed from a fully string theoretic starting point , which might restrict the allowed ranges of @xmath155 .",
    "another issue which deserves further study is the precise relationship between the radial coordinate @xmath156 of the brane within the warped throat , and the field @xmath14 which is used to describe the inflaton position in the supergravity description . the exact correspondence between these fields was not needed in because the main dependence on @xmath14 was taken to be through the khler modulus factor ( and superpotential corrections ) , rather than a combination of these with the brane - antibrane potential .",
    "we have simply identified the two fields in our analysis , but the actual relation could be more complicated , possibly introducing additional parameters into the lagrangian .",
