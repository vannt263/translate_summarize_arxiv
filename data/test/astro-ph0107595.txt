    "gamma - ray astronomy in the energy range above 100 gev has made dramatic progress in the last decade due to rapid development of the atmospheric cherenkov technique at a number of ground - based @xmath0-ray observatories .",
    "detection of cherenkov radiation from atmospheric cascades initiated by high energy particles has been considered as a potentially promising method for high energy @xmath0-ray astronomy since the fifties  @xcite due to the large collecting area of the technique , @xmath2 m@xmath3 . only recently , however , has it become possible to overcome the main factor limiting the sensitivities of ground - based observatories which utilize this method .",
    "this is the high rate of the cosmic ray ( cr ) background events .",
    "introduction of the two techniques , imaging and stereoscopy , pioneered by the whipple and hegra collaborations respectively  @xcite , has made a drastic improvement in the suppression of the background , and has made possible the reliable detection and spectroscopy of several galactic and extragalactic sources  @xcite .",
    "recent reviews of the development of high energy ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy can be found in  @xcite .",
    "methods for the efficient discrimination of photon and hadron initiated events have been derived from the differences in the intrinsic properties of the cherenkov radiation from purely electromagnetic and hadronic cascades .",
    "the most prominent of these is the substantially wider distribution of the arrival directions of photons in hadronic showers due to an additional angular scattering of the secondary products during hadronic interactions .",
    "this effect has been extensively studied in monte - carlo simulations of the cascade development in the atmosphere  @xcite , and the rejection criteria for the cosmic ray background has been derived in the form of the so - called `` shape cut ''  @xcite .",
    "increased angular resolution of ground - based @xmath0-ray observatories together with this means of identification of the primary photon are the most important components of the recent discoveries and advances made in the highest energy @xmath0-ray astronomy .",
    "the confidence of discovery of a @xmath0-ray source in the case of a background dominated data sample is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of detected events produced by a hypothetic source for a given exposure , and @xmath6 is the number of background events for the same observation time .",
    "this quantity reflects an excess of events due to the presence of a source measured in units of background standard deviation shown in the denominator for a poisson distribution .",
    "it is generally accepted that the existence of a source is established if @xmath7 .    by application of the background rejection procedure",
    "one increases the confidence of the source discovery due to elimination of the signal fluctuations connected with the background .",
    "the efficiency of the discrimination technique used to identify primary photons and reject cosmic ray events is expressed then as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the probabilities of acceptance of photon and background events after the application of selection criteria .",
    "thus the @xmath11 factor is an enhancement of @xmath12 indicating that @xmath13 times less exposure is required for a source discovery when a new discrimination technique is applied .",
    "this is true in the case of background dominated regime , when @xmath14 . on the contrary , in the statistics dominated regime ( @xmath15 ) , background rejection procedures with @xmath16 remarkably smaller than 1 should be avoided .    in this paper",
    "we explore a new discrimination technique that is characterized by efficiency @xmath17 in addition to the already existing methods of background suppression achieved by imposing shape and orientation cuts .",
    "this technique is based on the differences in intrinsic fluctuations of cherenkov radiation produced in the pure electromagnetic and hadronic cascades .",
    "we adapt the maximum likelihood approach based on an analysis of the @xmath18 functional to establish discrimination criteria to distinguish showers initiated by @xmath0-rays from those initiated by cr nuclei .",
    "this idea was induced originally by the study of the mass composition of primary cosmic radiation  @xcite where similar methods were proved to be very successful .",
    "the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope ( iact ) consists of a set of mirrors on a single mount with a two - dimensional array of close - packed hexagonal photomultiplier tubes ( pixels ) in the focal plane .",
    "therefore information about an event is recorded in the form of a two - dimensional image describing the distribution of the light intensity in the focal plane . ultimately , the cherenkov light image is a set of adc counts corresponding to all pixels .",
    "but for simplicity we deal with the number of photoelectrons emitted from the pixels photocathodes .",
    "hence the cherenkov light intensity in the focal plane is characterized by the continuous two dimensional distribution of photoelectron density , @xmath19 .",
    "each point @xmath20 on the focal plane corresponds to a certain arrival direction of photons relative to the pointing of the telescope mount .",
    "the total number of photoelectrons ( pes ) in the cherenkov light image , @xmath21 , is given by @xmath22 in our further calculations we make frequent use of the normalized to unity distribution of photoelectrons    @xmath23    which is equivalent to the probability density function ( pdf ) . by translation and rotation of the reference frame",
    "it is always possible to choose a new coordinate system @xmath24 in which the first moments of @xmath25 are equal to zero and the matrix of second moments is diagonalized .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath26 which characterize the extent of the cherenkov light distribution along the major and minor axes of the image , are often used as the image shape parameters .",
    "let us denote also the marginal distributions @xmath27 where indices @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the major and minor axes of the image respectively .",
    "we estimate @xmath30 and @xmath31 by the grid functions @xmath32 defined at @xmath33 .",
    "suppose that we have two sets of shower images , initiated by photons and cosmic rays , for which the mean values , @xmath34 , and variances , @xmath35 of the grid functions are found for each @xmath36 , .",
    "for each image we construct a pair of functionals @xmath37 @xmath38 so that the mean values of @xmath37 for @xmath0-showers and background events are equal to : @xmath39}}^2 } + \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{k=1}^{k } {   { { \\left[}\\frac{\\bar n_{t , k}^{{\\left(}\\gamma { \\right)}}- \\bar n_{t , k}^{{\\left(}\\mathrm{p } { \\right)}}}{{\\sigma_{n_{t , k}^{\\left ( \\gamma \\right)}}}}{\\right]}}^2 . } \\label{2contrib}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath40 consists of two terms .",
    "the first term reflects the differences in the fluctuations of the light intensity of images initiated by @xmath0-rays and those initiated by cr particles .",
    "the second one characterizes the differences between the average shapes of distributions of the photoelectron density in the images of the two data sets .",
    "strickly speaking , two different effects influence the value of the  fluctuation  term of @xmath40 .",
    "the first of them is connected with random variations of the angular size of the image described , for example , by width and length parameters .",
    "the second effect is the irregularity of the light distribution inside the image itself .",
    "we say in this case about the intrinsic fluctuations . even in the case of @xmath0-ray and proton induced images having the same angular size the first of them has a more smooth and regular structure and , therefore , a smaller value of intrinsic fluctuations .",
    "large fluctuations in the number of secondary particles created during the hadron multi - particle production is the main reason of difference in intrinsic fluctuations of @xmath0- and @xmath41-induced images .    in this work",
    "we attempt to make use of the contribution to @xmath40 from the first ( `` fluctuation '' ) term because we expect that the second term ( as well as the fluctuations connected with variations of the angular size of the image ) is rather small for images which passed the image shape selection criteria .    keeping in mind the argumentation presented above",
    ", one can hope to use selection criteria of the form    @xmath42    to reject cr - induced events and retain genuine photon - initiated showers . for a single telescope , two constants @xmath43 and @xmath44 should be optimized to maximize the signal to noise ratio ( see formula ( [ r_def ] ) ) . for a system of telescopes a set of similar criteria",
    "can be utilized @xmath45 in which condition ( [ single_xi_cond ] ) is satisfied simultaneously for all triggering telescopes .",
    "we consider a slightly more relaxed background rejection criterion @xmath46 which seems to retain more photon - initiated events and produce a higher efficiency factor ( [ eta ] ) . in the case of a single telescope ,",
    "both criteria ( [ single_xi_cond ] ) and ( [ syst_xi_cond2 ] ) are identical .",
    "the success of a selection criterion depends dramatically on how the data sets of photons and cr nuclei have been selected . in order to increase the selection efficiency one should consider the smaller regions of the primary photon parameter phase space and formulate selection criteria for each of them .",
    "we expect that the shower parameters which affect background rejection most strongly are the primary energy , @xmath47 and the impact parameter , @xmath48 ( the shortest distance between the telescope and the cascade core ) . in order to make the @xmath49 distribution narrower and",
    "thus improve the discrimination ability of the method , we will evaluate the dependence of the grid functions of photoelectron density on these parameters @xmath50    we would like to note that the @xmath18-based method has been used in the past to deduce parameters of the primary particle  @xcite . in our work , however , we do not explicitly assume that the fluctuations in the images of @xmath0-rays are of a poissonian nature .",
    "[ th ]    to investigate the discrimination efficiency of the method we have simulated two data bases of photon and proton initiated showers .",
    "this task has been accomplished by utilizing altai computation code  @xcite with input data summarized in table [ veritas_config ] . the geometrical layout of the veritas array of telescopes is shown in fig .",
    "[ veritas_tels ] .    .",
    ".basic parameters of veritas telescopes [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     [ edep ]",
    "in this work we have examined the feasibility of improving photon selection using differences in the fluctuations of the cherenkov light distribution between the images of @xmath0 and @xmath41 -initiated showers .",
    "three different event reconstruction methods which are likely be utilized in the next generation of ground - based @xmath0-ray observatories , such as veritas , have been studied .",
    "two of them are applicable to observations with a single telescope and one uses the stereoscopic capability of veritas array .",
    "optimization of our technique indicates that the proposed method provides an additional increase of the total discrimination efficiency by a factor @xmath1 retaining the survival probability of @xmath0-ray initiated events at the level larger than @xmath51 .",
    "that is true for both the telescope array and the single telescope ( with estimation of impact parameter by the @xmath52-based method ) .",
    "the achievable value of the total discrimination efficiency is equal to 6.5 and 3.6 respectively .",
    "when a single telescope event is reconstructed utilizing the @xmath53 parameter , our approach provides an additional discrimination efficiency factor @xmath54 .",
    "this is particularly important for a detection of extended sources or sources whose position has not been accurately identified .",
    "the discrimination efficiency of the proposed method increases rapidly with the energy of the primary photon .",
