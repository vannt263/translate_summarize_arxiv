    "current days biomolecules are receiving huge attention from different scientific communities including physics , chemistry and others because of their possible applications in nanoelctronics and the need of understanding electronic ( spin ) transfer process in biological systems  @xcite .",
    "dna is one of them which has attracted major attention from the beginning of the last decade  @xcite . whereas other biomolecules such as proteins are less attended in this respect .",
    "however with the recent progress in chiral - induced spin selectivity ( ciss ) both dna and protein are getting similar attraction  @xcite across various disciplines as they both have helical structures which can be used for efficient spin polarization . in 2011",
    "et al_.  @xcite showed that double - stranded dna ( ds - dna ) can be used as a good spin filtering agent with length dependent spin polarization up to 60@xmath0 . whereas no spin polarization was achieved for single - stranded dna ( ss - dna ) .",
    "these findings are then theoretically supported by guo _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "but recent experiments suggest that @xmath1-helical proteins are also quite efficient in spin polarization process though it has single helical structure  @xcite .",
    "these results open up an opportunity to examine these single - helical structures from a new aspect , different models are also proposed to explain these experimental results  @xcite . in respect of electronic transport properties dna",
    "is widely studied , though there are still controversies over different experimental results  @xcite .",
    "questions are still remain on reproducibility of the experimental data and underlying charge transfer mechanism  @xcite . whereas the same properties of different protein molecules are less examined .",
    "there are few number of reports available in literature on the electronic transfer process in proteins  @xcite but no such report on the effects of environment on its electronic transport properties .",
    "it is confirmed by ciss study and related theoretical work that there are multiple charge conduction pathways ( mccp ) present in single - helical proteins due to which they are able to polarize the electron spin  @xcite .",
    "this possibility of mccp make helical protein molecules very good agents for long - range charge transport .",
    "as proteins have these mccp , electrons will face less disturbances / environmental effects during conduction and transport characteristics will be much rigid ; reproducing experimental results will be much simpler with them .",
    "in this paper we make an attempt to study the electronic transport properties of single helical proteins incorporating both the helical symmetry and possibility of mccp within tight - binding framework .",
    "we propose a model hamiltonian to explore electronic transport through single - helical proteins and compare our results with another model proposed in ref .",
    "we study different transport properties from localization behaviour to i - v response including the effects of environment that are modeled in terms of disordered on - site potential of the amino acids within the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "our investigations show that due to presence of mccp the effects of environment are much smaller which enable long range coherent charge transfer in these biomolecules .",
    "interplay of helical symmetry and disorder also has non - trivial effects on localization and i - v responses of the protein molecules .",
    "the two - terminal electronic transport through single - helical protein molecule can be simulated using the following tight - binding hamiltonian for the entire system    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian for the protein molecule , @xmath4 represents the one dimensional semi - infinite leads on the both sides of the protein molecule and @xmath5 is the tunneling hamiltonian between protein molecule and the leads .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( fig.[fig1 ] ) for the protein molecule is formed on the basis set spanned by the amino acids @xmath6    where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for electrons at the _",
    "i_th wannier state of the protein molecule with length n , @xmath9 nearest neighbour hopping amplitude , @xmath10 on - site potential energy of the amino acids , @xmath11= hopping integral between two neighboring atomic sites in adjacent pitches which incorporates the possibility of mccp along the helix . here",
    "@xmath12 is the number of amino acids within a given pitch , parameter that accounts for the helical symmetry .",
    "a dispersion relation for an infinite homogeneous chain of protein molecule can be obtained following the above hamiltonian : @xmath13 which explicitly depends on helical symmetry ( @xmath12 ) .    ) between neighbouring amino acids of adjacent pitches .",
    "the red line shows the single helix.,width=64,height=283 ]    apart from the above model , we also use another model following ref .",
    "@xcite to compare our results .",
    "the protein molecule is described in this model following the tight - binding hamiltonian ( later on we refer this as model:2 throughout the paper )    @xmath14    where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath15 and n have their usual meanings .",
    "@xmath17 is the jth neighbouring hopping amplitude , where @xmath18 is the distance between to neighbour @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the decay exponent and @xmath22 is the nearest neighbour hopping integral .",
    "here we have assumed that wave functions related to electrons decay exponentially over distance .",
    "these assumptions are similar to the slater - koster scheme , and @xmath21 can be obtained by matching to first - principle calculations  @xcite .    in order to study the transport behavior of protein molecules , we use semi - infinite 1d chains as leads connected to",
    "the left ( l ) and right ( r ) ends of the protein molecule and the corresponding hamiltonian can be expressed as    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively represent left and right semi - infinite 1d leads .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian between the leads and protein molecule is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the tunneling matrix element between protein and the leads . in order to obtain transmission probability @xmath28 of electron through single - helical protein",
    "we use the green s function formalism  @xcite .",
    "the single particle retarded green s function for the entire system at an energy @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "the transmission probability of an electron with incident energy @xmath29 is given by @xmath32 $ ] where @xmath33 represents trace over reduced hilbert space spanned by the protein molecule .",
    "the retarded and the advanced green s functions in the reduced hilbert space can be expressed as @xmath34^\\dagger=[e- h_{pro}-\\sigma^r_l-\\sigma^r_r+i\\eta]^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath35 is retarded ( advanced ) self energy of the left ( right ) lead and @xmath36 $ ] is the level broadening due to coupling of the leads with the protein molecule . @xmath37 being the retarded ( advanced ) green s function for the left ( right ) lead .",
    "it can easily be shown that @xmath38 , where @xmath39 represents the imaginary part . at absolute zero temperature , using the landauer formula , current through the protein molecule for an applied bias voltage @xmath40 is given by @xmath41  , where @xmath42 is the fermi energy .",
    "we have assumed that voltage drop occurs only at the boundaries of the conductor .",
    "to perform numerical study we use following parameter values for our proposed model throughout the entire work : @xmath15=0 ev , @xmath43=1.0 ev and @xmath11=@xmath43/10=0.1 ev .",
    "we compare our results with model:2 using the following parameters : @xmath44=4.1 , @xmath45=5.8 , @xmath46=5.1 , @xmath47=6.2 , @xmath48=8.9 , @xmath49=10.0 and @xmath21 is taken as 0.9 , all units are in  . using these values",
    "we can calculate the related hopping integrals ( @xmath16 ) which gives @xmath50 @xmath51 0.16@xmath22 and so on .",
    "it is clear that gradually @xmath16 values will decrease ( except @xmath52 ) with increasing distance , therefore we restrict ourselves to @xmath53 and set @xmath22=@xmath43=1.0 ev .",
    "these parameter values for model:2 are extracted from ref .",
    "for ss - dna , to calculate its transport properties , we set @xmath11=0 ev in our model which cancels any possibility of mccp .",
    "we first study the localization properties of the system .",
    "the localization length ( @xmath54 ) of the system is calculated from the lyapunov exponent ( @xmath55 )  @xcite    @xmath56    where @xmath57 = length of the system and @xmath58 denotes average over different disorder configurations . in actual experiments",
    "there are various environmental fluctuations that we have simulated in the model by considering the on - site energy @xmath15 to be randomly distributed within the range [ @xmath15-w/2 , @xmath15+w/2 ] , where w represents the disorder strength .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the i - v characteristics of the protein molecule using our proposed model for @xmath12=3 and 5 .",
    "it is clear from the plots that for low disorder , current is almost linear and with increasing disorder ( w=5 ) system becomes insulating .",
    "one difference is to be noted between @xmath12=3 and 5 , current output is always greater for @xmath12=5 than @xmath12=3 .",
    "this difference becomes more distinguishable under environmental fluctuations .",
    "if we increase @xmath12 , electrons get more number of pathways to hop from one site to another . in other words",
    ", increasing @xmath12 provides a shortcut pathway for electrons to move along the helix from one pitch to the next bypassing all other amino acids in that pitch . due to",
    "this galloping electrons encounter less scattering , hence the current increases . for @xmath12=5 at w=2 , i - v response is linear at low bias but it saturates with increasing bias voltage which signifies that there are no more accessible states available to conduct electrons at higher bias . for model:2 , at low disorder",
    "there is not so much variation in the current response with our model , but for appreciable disorder ( w=2 ) response become semiconducting with cut - off voltage around 0.5 volt , in contrast with linear response achieved in our model .",
    "this variation of current is due to the difference in these two models .",
    "the model:2 only caters the possibility of multiple charge conduction pathways but neglect the helical symmetry which is a fundamental structure of these biomolecules .",
    "our model also incorporates this symmetry , due to which electron transport enhances and current output is always greater in our case ( @xmath12=5 ) .",
    "the i - v responses of the protein molecule under environmental effects match qualitatively well with experimental findings  @xcite . for ss - dna current output",
    "is quite similar with the protein molecule for clean case ( w=0 ) , but as soon as we apply disorder current decreases rapidly .",
    "if we compare ss - dna with protein molecule ( @xmath12=5 ) , one can easily see that even under small disorder ( w=0.5 , 0.8 ) there is substantial drop in the current output for ss - dna .",
    "this shows that single - helical proteins are much better conductor under external disturbances than ss - dna .",
    "we present a detail analysis of electronic transport properties of single - helical protein molecules based on tight - binding framework .",
    "though with recent progress in ciss single helical proteins are getting considerable attention these days but their basic electronic transport properties remain quite under - explored .",
    "we show that due to existence of both the helical symmetry and mccp transport properties are less affected by external disturbances and these biomolecules can serve as a better alternative in nanoelectronics than its dna counterparts ( ss - dna ) or other artificial semiconductor nanowires which do not contain the possibility of mccp . as a consequence of these features long range coherent electron transport",
    "can be possible in these biomolecules and effect of environment will also be lesser .",
    "we also show that by varying @xmath12 _ i.e. _ , by twist - stretching of the protein molecules one can get different responses ( current outputs ) under environmental effects . as an example , for @xmath12=5 system is more conducting than @xmath12=3 .",
    "we compare our results with the model proposed by guo et al .",
    "@xcite , that matches qualitatively well in almost every aspect .",
    "but as our model includes both mccp and helical symmetry ( both are actually present in single - helical proteins ) it provides more number of conduction channels and system becomes less localized .",
    "due to helical symmetry ( @xmath12 ) the behaviour of localization properties also change which shows that using twist - stretching or conformal changes one can use a protein molecule in different ways .",
    "we check our results for other model parameters also _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath21=0.4 and 1.4   @xcite but the qualitative behaviour remains the same . in summary",
    "our study shows the rigidity of transport properties of the single - helical protein molecules even under environmental effects due to presence of both the helical symmetry and mccp , which promises that they can be used in future nanoelectronic devices with much more reliability ."
