    "most mass in the universe is in the form of dark matter , and most dark matter is gravitationally clustered in the form of halos .",
    "dark matter halos are therefore the building blocks of the universe .",
    "knowledge of the formation and evolution history of dark matter halos is essential for an understanding of the halos structure and dynamics , as well as the environment that harbors galaxies and clusters .",
    "designs for dark matter search experiments also rely on the predicted spatial and velocity distributions of dark matter particles in our own galaxy .    according to the theory of structure formation in current cosmological models ,",
    "dark matter halos arise from tiny primordial fluctuations seeded in the matter and radiation fields in the early universe at , for example , the end of an inflationary era .",
    "these small inhomogeneities grow via gravitational instability , with the slightly overdense regions becoming denser and the slightly underdense regions becoming emptier . at a given time",
    ", there exists a spectrum of density fluctuations over a wide range of length and mass scales , whose spatial distribution is characterized by the power density in fourier space @xmath0 , the power spectrum .",
    "dark matter halos therefore rarely form and evolve in isolation , growing instead by frequent accretion of smaller - mass halos and occasional major mergers with other halos of comparable mass .",
    "the earliest theoretical insight into cosmological halo formation came from the spherical radial infall model , which considers an isolated spherical overdense volume and describes the secondary infall of bound but initially expanding collisionless matter onto this region @xcite .",
    "if the initial density perturbation spectrum is scale - free and the velocity distribution follows the hubble law , the infall solution is found to approach a self - similar form in an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "the resulting density profile asymptotically approaches @xmath1 with @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the exact value of @xmath3 depends on the index of the initial perturbation spectrum @xmath4 : it is isothermal ( @xmath5 ) for @xmath6 and for @xmath7 steepens to @xmath8 @xcite or @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the collapse of halos therefore retains memory of the initial conditions in the radial infall model .",
    "by contrast , modern cosmological n - body simulations find dark matter halos over a wide range of mass scales to follow a density profile that is nearly independent of the initial power spectrum and is shallower near the halo centers ( with @xmath10 ) than that predicted by the radial infall model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dark matter in the simulated halos is not entirely smoothly distributed spatially ; instead , at least 10% of the halo mass is in the form of hundreds to thousands of smaller , dense satellite halos of varying mass @xcite .",
    "thus even though the analytic similarity solutions derived from one - dimensional infall onto a smooth overdensity have provided valuable insight into the evolution of self - gravitating systems , realistic halo formation is clearly more complicated .",
    "numerical simulation has been the tool most frequently used in cosmology to study structure formation .",
    "it has provided powerful insight and occasionally surprising results ( e.g. universal density profile ) unexplainable by the simulations themselves .",
    "our understanding of structure formation can certainly be enhanced if a complementary tool is developed .",
    "complementary approaches are also especially needed at this time to help us better understand and perhaps resolve the `` cuspy halo '' and `` dwarf satellite '' problems of the cold dark matter model .    in this paper",
    "we offer a new perspective on the subject of dark matter halo formation by proposing an approach different from both the radial infall model and n - body simulations .",
    "we focus on the phase - space distribution of dark matter in galaxy halos instead of on the motion of a mass shell ( as in infall models ) or the orbit of a simulation particle ( as in n - body ) .",
    "we attempt to understand the evolution of the phase - space distribution with a statistical description based on kinetic theory .",
    "our method is to be contrasted with the standard method where the individual dark matter particles are described by the collisionless boltzmann equation ; n - body simulations are in essence a monte carlo method for solving this equation .",
    "instead , we consider the phase space of dark matter particles in an average halo and develop a cosmological kinetic theory for halo evolution in the presence of a spectrum of density fluctuations .    the essential features of our approach are represented by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for time - dependent stochastic processes . to elaborate on this concept , we recall that stochastic modelling was first developed to explain the brownian motion of pollen particles suspended in a fluid .",
    "( see   [ sec : brownian ] for a more detailed discussion . )",
    "this phenomenon is now understood to arise from a fluctuating force on a brownian particle due to many rapid collisions with the molecules in the surrounding fluid .",
    "these fluctuations cause successive small changes in the particle velocity , hence to a random walk .",
    "the consequence of many such random walks is diffusion , a form of dissipation .    due to the large number of molecules , it is impossible to solve the coupled equations of motion for the trajectories of all molecules and the pollen particle in the fluid",
    "fortunately , a stochastic treatment suffices .",
    "one mathematical prescription is provided by the langevin equation @xcite , which models the forces arising from the fluctuations as a stochastic term that is added to all other deterministic forces in the equation of motion for a particle .",
    "an alternative prescription is given by the fokker - planck equation @xcite , which is an equation of motion for the probability density or distribution function of particles undergoing random walks .",
    "in this case , the collective changes in the velocities due to the fluctuations in the system are represented by a drift coefficient and a diffusion coefficient arising from the collision terms in the collisional boltzmann equation .",
    "stochastic phenomena occur beyond molecular scales . in astrophysics ,",
    "the best studied example is the evolution of dense stellar systems such as globular clusters @xcite .",
    "a star in a globular cluster experiences a fluctuating force from many gravitational two - body encounters and suffers a succession of small velocity changes .",
    "the fluctuations in these systems arise from granularity in the mass distribution at the locations of the stars . the fokker - planck approximation is valid for these weak encounters .",
    "we explore this example in greater detail and contrast it with our model of galaxy halo evolution in   [",
    "sec : globular ] .",
    "the key feature common to all of these systems is the presence of stochastic fluctuations that result in dissipation . in the cosmological",
    "setting addressed by this paper , the fluctuations arise from cosmological perturbations produced in the early universe . at early times , these perturbations are gaussian and fully characterized by their power spectrum ; at late times , the substructures in halos seen in recent simulations are the nonlinear counterparts of this spectrum of early ripples .",
    "these fluctuations scatter particles .",
    "if one considers an ensemble of halos , the masses and locations of the substructures ( or their gaussian predecessors ) are random variables .",
    "the substructures thereby introduce `` noise '' into the evolution of dark matter halos . as we show in this paper ,",
    "the result is dissipation in the form of drift and velocity - space diffusion .",
    "recent work has explored the use of the fokker - planck equation in cosmological problems .",
    "@xcite , for example , searched for steady - state solutions of the fokker - planck equation assuming the fluctuations arise from two - body encounters .",
    "it also assumed a simple isotropic phase space distribution dependent only on the total energy and a radial power law form for the potential and density . under these assumptions",
    ", @xcite found that @xmath11 was a steady - state solution under the effects of encounters .",
    "there was no dynamics in this work , however : the system was assumed to be in collisionless equilibrium and the nature of the clumps producing the collisions was left arbitrary .",
    "it also remains to be determined whether galaxy halos , either dark matter or stellar , actually evolve to @xmath12 cusp .",
    "@xcite examined the dynamics of halos due to stochastic fluctuations from three different noise processes for the fokker - planck scattering term : the merging clumps were assumed to fly by with constant velocity , to follow decaying orbits due to dynamical friction , or to orbit inside halos .",
    "the results of this study were promising and supported the notion that the density profiles of halos were affected by mergers and substructures . the fluctuations in this work , however , were constructed by hand instead of being self - consistently calculated , and the results about a central cusp were inconclusive .    our objective here is to construct a kinetic equation in which the drift and diffusion terms are derived from realistic density fluctuations in current cosmological models .",
    "we will also retain the full phase space information by , in effect , using @xmath13 without averaging over the angular momentum or radial velocity .",
    "we also do not assume collisionless equilibrium ; instead we base our approach on exact dynamics .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows :    in   2 , we derive the kinetic equation relevant for the evolution of an average halo , starting with the collisionless boltzmann equation for individual dark matter particles .",
    "this procedure gives rise to a collision term on the right - hand side of the kinetic equation .",
    "this term represents a correlated force density and arises from fluctuations in the ensemble averaged gravitational potential due to clustering of the matter distribution .    in",
    ", we introduce the concepts and physical variables needed to apply this equation to cosmological problems .",
    "the key step is in relating the phase space density @xmath14 to the probability densities of two standard variables in cosmology : the mass density @xmath15 and velocity @xmath16 .",
    "we then focus on the quasi - linear regime in which the fluctuations about the mean density and hubble flow of an isotropic and homogeneous universe are small .",
    "this focus allows us to relate @xmath15 and @xmath16 to the density and displacement fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which are gaussian random fields in standard cosmological models .",
    "we leave the most mathematical part of the paper to appendix  [ sec : pgauss ] , where we describe how to use the statistics of constrained gaussian random fields to express the probability densities of   3 in terms of the ( constrained ) means and covariances of the density and displacement fields .",
    "the idea of a constrained field is central to this study because our aim is to construct a kinetic theory for dark matter particles that will later reside in a collapsed halo rather than at any random location in the universe .",
    "the relevant perturbations are for a density field constrained to have certain properties , e.g. , a specified height or gradient at some point in space .",
    "the spectrum for such constrained fields is related but not identical to the familiar linear power spectrum @xmath19 for unconstrained gaussian density fluctuations .    in ",
    "[ sec : fpeq ] , we put the final expression for the correlated force derived in appendix  [ sec : pgauss ] back into the kinetic equation , and show that the resulting equation is of the fokker - planck form where one term represents a drift force and the other term represents diffusion in velocity - space .",
    "we work out these diffusion coefficients for the currently - favored cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant ( @xmath20cdm ) model , and provide explicit expressions for these coefficients in terms of the linear matter fluctuation power spectrum .",
    "we also present the results for the coefficients computed for this model .    ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] discusses further the physical meaning of the results in   [ sec : fpeq ] .",
    "we interpret the diffusion terms by taking velocity moments of the kinetic equation .",
    "to place our cosmological kinetic equation in a broader perspective , we discuss in more detail the classical examples of brownian motion and globular clusters , and point out the similarities and differences among the three cases .",
    "  [ sec : conclu ] provides a summary and conclusions . in appendix",
    "[ sec : stationary ] we investigate the relaxation to stationary solutions of our cosmological fokker - planck equation .",
    "we derive the kinetic equation for galaxy halo evolution following the methods presented by @xcite for the derivation of the bbgky hierarchy .",
    "the starting point is the one - particle phase space density for dark matter particles in a single halo , the klimontovich ( or klimontovich - dupree ) density @xcite @xmath21      \\delta_{\\rm d}[\\vec v-\\vec v_i(t)]\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the dirac delta function and the subscript k denotes the use of the klimontovich density .",
    "we suppose that each halo is made of equal - mass particles of mass @xmath23 , for example , the elementary particles of non - baryonic dark matter models . for convenience , we use velocity rather than momentum and we choose units so that @xmath24 is a mass density .",
    "we use proper coordinates except for   [ sec : cosmovar ] and appendix  [ sec : pgauss ] , where we will switch to the appropriate cosmological ( comoving ) coordinates .",
    "the klimontovich density is simply a way of casting the exact trajectories of all @xmath25 particles in a system into the form of a phase space density .",
    "the number of particles in @xmath26 about @xmath27 is @xmath28 , which equals either 0 or 1 .",
    "the klimontovich density consists of delta functions because , when one is dealing with a single system ( as opposed to an ensemble ) , every particle has a well - defined position and velocity .",
    "the reason for introducing this quantity is that it gives a particularly clean way of going from exact n - body dynamics to a statistical description by taking expectation values of @xmath29 or products of more than one @xmath29 over an ensemble of n - body systems .",
    "this approach to kinetic theory is different from the usual method that begins with the n - particle distribution for an ensemble .",
    "the klimontovich density obeys the klimontovich - dupree equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 for notational convenience we have grouped together all 6 phase space coordinates into @xmath32 .",
    "( [ klim ] ) is exact , as may be verified by substituting eq .",
    "( [ phaseden ] ) and using the equations of motion for individual particles , @xmath33 in practice , the gravitational force may be softened by modifying eq .",
    "( [ gravec ] ) to reduce artificial two - body relaxation , as is done in n - body simulations .",
    "( [ phaseden ] ) and ( [ klim ] ) are entirely equivalent to eqs .",
    "( [ newton ] ) for one system .",
    "the klimontovich phase space density retains _ all _ information about a particular halo because it specifies the trajectories of all particles .",
    "( [ phaseden])([newton ] ) are formally equivalent to a perfect n - body simulation .",
    "that is not what we want . rather than giving a perfect description of a single halo , we average over halos to obtain a statistical description of halo evolution .",
    "while it is impossible to completely describe a single galactic halo of dark matter particles , by using statistical mechanics methods we _ can _ describe the average of infinitely many halos !    before proceeding further , we make one important modification to the usual procedure in kinetic theory .",
    "( [ newton ] ) assume that we work in an inertial frame .",
    "this is satisfactory for an isolated halo but not for a halo formed in a cosmological context where neighbors cause it to orbit in the net gravitational field produced by all matter .",
    "the center of mass of a halo typically moves much farther in a hubble time than the size of the halo itself , even in an inertial frame in which the halo begins at rest .",
    "for example , for the cold dark matter family of models , the displacement of a mass element from its initial position ( in comoving coordinates ) is typically several mpc today .",
    "if we statistically average over an ensemble of halos each of which wanders this far in a hubble time , the phase space density will be artificially smeared out , making the resulting average `` halo '' much larger than any realistic halo .",
    "we avoid this by doing the same thing that simulators do when they construct halo profiles : we work in the center - of - mass frame of each halo .    indeed , at each moment the halo center - of - mass must be at rest in our reference frame .",
    "this frame is non - inertial because of the gravitational forces acting on the halo .",
    "thus we must modify the kinetic equation to apply to an accelerating frame .",
    "fortunately , the accelerations are small and the frame is extended only a few mpc , so we do not have to worry about relativistic effects .",
    "we simply include the inertial ( `` fictitious '' ) forces associated with working in an accelerating frame .",
    "we choose to define @xmath34 as the center - of - mass of each halo . transforming eqs .",
    "( [ newton ] ) to the center - of - mass frame is very simple : we replace @xmath35 by the _ tidal _ gravitational field relative to the center of each halo , @xmath36 , and then subtract the center - of - mass velocity from the initial velocity of each particle .",
    "( [ klim ] ) is unchanged except that @xmath35 is replaced by @xmath37 the subscript t is a reminder that this is the tidal gravitational field .",
    "now we return to the usual procedure for deriving a kinetic equation .",
    "the klimontovich density is the phase space density for a single realization of a halo .",
    "we might imagine performing many n - body simulations of different halos , each with slightly different initial conditions .",
    "if we average the klimontovich density over this ensemble of halos , the result ( at least , in the limit where the size of the ensemble becomes infinite ) is no longer a sum of delta functions but instead is a smooth _ one - particle distribution function _ : @xmath38 where angle brackets denote the ensemble average .",
    "recall that for notational convenience we have grouped all six phase space variables into @xmath39 .",
    "our goal is to derive a tractable kinetic equation for @xmath40 .",
    "the obvious next step is to take the ensemble average of eq .",
    "( [ klim ] ) .",
    "to proceed , however , we will need the _ two - particle distribution function _ @xmath41 , which follows from averaging the product of klimontovich densities at two points : @xmath42 the delta - function term @xmath43 corresponds to the case in which the two points lie on top of one particle .",
    "two distinct particles give the @xmath44 term , which may always be written as a product term plus a two - particle correlation : @xmath45 this equation defines the two - point correlation function in phase space , @xmath46 .",
    "the averaging we perform is similar to the averaging used in defining ordinary clustering correlation functions in cosmology .",
    "the differences here are that we are not averaging over arbitrary systems but only over those that lead to formation of a halo at @xmath34 , and that we retain velocity information .",
    "had we averaged over all space and integrated over velocities , we would have gotten @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the cosmic mean mass density and @xmath50 is the usual spatial two - point correlation function .",
    "now , by taking the ensemble average of eq .",

    "( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ f2c ] ) . the one - particle discreteness term in eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) makes no contribution because the particle has no self - force .",
    "( [ boltzeq ] ) is the first bbgky hierarchy equation @xcite . in cosmological applications",
    "this equation is usually derived starting from the liouville equation for the n - particle distribution function . in order to clarify the averaging that is done here ,",
    "we have started instead from the one - particle klimontovich density .",
    "the result , eq .  ( [ boltzeq ] ) , is an evolution equation that looks very much like eq .",
    "( [ klim ] ) .",
    "by averaging over halos , however , we have introduced a correlation integral term on the right - hand side .",
    "the _ average _ halo therefore does not evolve according to the vlasov equation ; instead , it evolves according to a kinetic equation with an effective collision term .",
    "( [ boltzeq])([g2 ] ) are exact . no approximation has been made yet .",
    "( [ boltzeq ] ) is a continuity equation for density in phase space . without the right - hand side",
    ", it says that phase space density is conserved along trajectories given by eq .",
    "( [ newton ] ) modified for the tidal force . the right - hand side gives a correction due to the fact that fluctuations about the ensemble average lead to correlated forces .",
    "as we will see , the effects of these fluctuations lead to dissipation . because the correction term is a divergence , the mass density @xmath56 is not dissipated but instead is conserved .    in most applications of kinetic theory , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ boltzeq ] ) arises from particle collisions . in the usual treatment of a gas of particles with short - range forces",
    ", one assumes @xmath57 always except during particle collisions .",
    "this is the assumption of molecular chaos that boltzmann introduced to derive his celebrated kinetic equation .",
    "our situation , however , is different : we can not neglect @xmath46 , because it can be much larger than the single - particle term in eq .",
    "( [ f2c ] ) due to strong gravitational clustering .",
    "heuristically , @xmath46 describes the substructure within a galaxy halo at the two - point level .",
    "( higher order correlation functions would be needed for a complete description . )",
    "current cosmological models and observations imply that the initial density field has fluctuations that cause the formation of many small halos which subsequently merge into present - day halos .",
    "the lumpiness of the matter distribution represents a fluctuation about the ensemble average density field . through the correlated force density @xmath58 , these fluctuations cause changes in the energy and angular momentum of individual particle orbits that are important for the evolution of the one - particle distribution function .",
    "( [ boltzeq ] ) is useful only if we find an expression for @xmath46 .",
    "one way to proceed would be to derive a kinetic equation for @xmath46 by taking the ensemble average of eq .",
    "( [ klim ] ) multiplied by the klimontovich density .",
    "this leads to the second bbgky equation , which depends on the three - point correlation in phase space , which obeys the third bbgky equation , and so on .",
    "thus we either have an infinite chain of coupled equations of increasing dimensionality , or we must close the system .",

    "<S> we present a kinetic theory for the evolution of the phase - space distribution of dark matter particles in galaxy halos in the presence of a cosmological spectrum of fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this theory introduces a new way to model the formation and evolution of halos , which traditionally have been investigated by analytic gravitational infall models or numerical n - body methods . unlike the collisionless boltzmann equation , </S>",
    "<S> our kinetic equation contains nonzero terms on the right - hand side arising from stochastic fluctuations in the gravitational potential due to substructures in the dark matter mass distribution . using statistics for constrained gaussian random fields in standard cosmological models , </S>",
    "<S> we show that our kinetic equation to second - order in perturbation theory is of the fokker - planck form , with one scattering term representing drift and the other representing diffusion in velocity - space . </S>",
    "<S> the drift is radial , and the drift and diffusion coefficients depend only on positions and not velocities ; our relaxation process in the quasilinear regime is therefore different from the standard two - body relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> we provide explicit expressions relating these coefficients to the linear power spectrum of mass fluctuations and present results for the currently favored cold dark matter model with a nonzero cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> solutions to this kinetic equation will provide a complete description of the cold dark matter spatial and velocity distributions for the average halo during the early phases of galaxy halo formation . </S>"
