    "many solids have a crystalline structure . however , ideal crystals are absent in nature , and most of their physical properties , such as plasticity , melting , growth , etc . , are defined by defects of the crystalline structure .",
    "therefore , a study of defects is a topical scientific question of importance for applications in the first place . a broad experimental and theoretical investigations of defects in crystals started in the 1930s and continues nowadays .",
    "at present , a fundamental theory of defects is absent in spite of the existence of dozens of monographs and thousands of articles .",
    "one of the most promising approaches to the theory of defects is based on riemann  cartan geometry , which involves nontrivial metric and torsion . in this approach ,",
    "a crystal is considered as a continuous elastic medium with a spin structure .",
    "if the displacement vector field is a smooth function , then there are only elastic stresses corresponding to diffeomorphisms of the euclidean space .",
    "if the displacement vector field has discontinuities , then we are saying that there are defects in the elastic structure .",
    "defects in the elastic structure are called dislocations and lead to the appearance of nontrivial geometry .",
    "precisely , they correspond to a nonzero torsion tensor , equal to the surface density of the burgers vector .",
    "the idea to relate torsion to dislocations appeared in the 1950s [ 14 ] .",
    "this approach is still being successfully developed ( note reviews [ 511 ] ) , and is often called the gauge theory of dislocations .",
    "a similar approach is also being developed in gravity @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that e cartan introduced torsion in geometry @xcite having the analogy with mechanics of elastic media in mind .",
    "the gauge approach to the theory of defects is being developed successfully , and interesting results are being obtained in this way [ 1417 ] .",
    "we note in this connection two respects in which the approach proposed below is essentially different . in the gauge models of dislocations based on the translational group or on the semidirect product of the rotational group with translations ,",
    "one usually chooses the distortion and displacement fields as independent variables .",
    "it is always possible to fix the invariance under local translations such that the displacement field becomes zero because it transforms by simple translation under the action of the translational group . in this sense ,",
    "the displacement field is the gauge parameter of local translations , and physical observables are independent of it in gauge - invariant models .",
    "the other disadvantage of the gauge approach is the equations of equilibrium .",
    "einstein type equations are usually considered for distortion or vielbein , with the right hand side depending on the stress tensor .",
    "this appears unacceptable from the physical point of view because of the following reason .",
    "consider , for example , one straight edge dislocation .",
    "in this case , the elastic stress field differs from zero everywhere .",
    "then the torsion tensor ( or curvature ) is also nontrivial in the whole space due to the equations of equilibrium .",
    "this is wrong from our point of view .",
    "indeed , we can consider an arbitrary domain of medium outside the cutting surface and look at the creation process for an edge dislocation .",
    "the chosen domain was a part of the euclidean space with identically zero torsion and curvature before the defect creation .",
    "it is clear that torsion and curvature remain zero because the process of dislocation formation is a diffeomorphism for the considered domain .",
    "in addition , the cutting surface may be chosen arbitrary for the defect creation , leaving the dislocation axis unchanged .",
    "then it follows that torsion and curvature must be zero everywhere except at the axis of dislocation . in other words",
    ", the elasticity stress tensor can not be the source of dislocations . to avoid the apparent contradiction",
    ", we propose a radical way out : we do not use the displacement field as an independent variable at all .",
    "this does not mean that the displacement field does not exist in real crystals .",
    "in the proposed approach , the displacement field exists and can be computed in those regions of medium that do not contain cores of dislocations . in this case , it satisfies the equations of nonlinear elasticity theory .",
    "the proposed geometric approach allows considering other defects that do not relate directly to defects of elastic media .",
    "the intensive investigations of other defects were conducted in parallel with the study of dislocations .",
    "the point is that many solids have not only elastic properties but also a spin structure .",
    "for example , there are ferromagnets , liquid crystals , spin glasses . in this case , there are defects in the spin structure which are called disclinations @xcite .",
    "they arise when the director field has discontinuities .",
    "the presence of disclinations is also connected to nontrivial geometry .",
    "namely , the curvature tensor equals the surface density of the frank vector .",
    "the gauge approach based on the rotational group @xmath0 was also used for describing disclinations @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-gauge models of spin glasses with defects were considered in @xcite .",
    "the geometric theory of static distribution of defects which describes both types of defects  dislocation and disclinations  from a single standpoint was proposed in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other approaches , it involves the vielbein and @xmath0 connection as the only independent variables .",
    "the torsion and curvature tensors have direct physical meaning as the surface densities of dislocations and disclinations , respectively .",
    "covariant equations of equilibrium for the vielbein and @xmath0 connection similar to those in a gravity model with torsion are postulated . to define the solution uniquely",
    ", we must fix the coordinate system ( fix the gauge ) because any solution of the equations of equilibrium is defined up to general coordinate transformations and local @xmath0 rotations . the elastic gauge for the vielbein @xcite and lorentz gauge for the @xmath0 connection @xcite were proposed recently .",
    "we stress that the notions of a displacement vector and rotational angle are completely absent in our approach .",
    "these notions can be introduced only in those domains where defects are absent . in this case ,",
    "equations for vielbein and @xmath0 connection are identically satisfied , the elastic gauge reduces to the equations of nonlinear elasticity theory for the displacement vector , and the lorentz gauge leads to the equations for the principal chiral @xmath0 field . in other words , to fix the coordinate system , we choose two fundamental models : the elasticity theory and the principal chiral field model .    to show the advantages of the geometric approach and to compare it with the elasticity theory , we consider in detail a wedge dislocation in the frameworks of the elasticity theory and the proposed geometric model .",
    "we show that the explicit expression for the metric in the geometric approach is simpler and coincides with the induced metric obtained within the elasticity theory only for small relative deformations .    as an application of the geometric theory of defects , we consider two examples in the last sections of the present review .",
    "first , we solve the problem of phonon scattering on a wedge dislocation .",
    "the problem of phonon scattering is reduced to the integration of equations for extremals for the metric describing a wedge dislocation ( because phonons move along extremals in the eikonal approximation ) .",
    "as a second application , we consider the quantum mechanical problem of impurity or vacancy motion inside a cylinder whose axis coincides with a wedge dislocation .",
    "the wave functions and energetic spectrum of the impurity are found explicitly .",
    "the presence of defects results in nontrivial riemann  cartan geometry .",
    "this means that for describing the phenomena that relate ingeniously to elastic media , we must make changes in the corresponding equations .",
    "for example , if a phonon propagation in an ideal crystal is described by the wave equation , then the presence of defects is easily taken into account . for this",
    ", the flat euclidean metric has to be replaced by a nontrivial metric describing the distribution of defects .",
    "the same substitution must be made in the schrdinger equation to describe other quantum effects .",
    "it is shown nowadays that the presence of defects essentially influences physical phenomena .",
    "the schrdinger equation in the presence of dislocations was considered in [ 2546 ] for different problems .",
    "problems related to the wave or laplace equations were considered in [ 4754 ] .",
    "the influence of the nontrivial metric related to the presence of defects was investigated in electrodynamics @xcite and hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "scattering of phonons on straight parallel dislocations was studied in [ 5759 ] .",
    "another approach to the theory of defects based on affine geometry with nonzero nonmetricity tensor was considered recently in @xcite .",
    "we consider infinite three dimensional elastic media . we suppose that the undeformed medium in the defect - free case is invariant under translations and rotations in some coordinate system .",
    "then , the medium in this coordinate system @xmath1 , @xmath2 , is described by the euclidean metric @xmath3 , and the system of coordinates is called cartesian .",
    "thus , in the undeformed state , we have the euclidean space @xmath4 with a given cartesian coordinate system .",
    "we also assume that torsion ( see the appendix ) in the medium equals zero .",
    "let a point of the medium has coordinates @xmath1 in the ground state .",
    "after deformation , this point has the coordinates @xmath5    .45    in the initial coordinate system , see fig .",
    "[ feldef ] .",
    "the inverse notation is used in the elasticity theory .",
    "one usually writes @xmath6 .",
    "these are equivalent because both coordinate systems @xmath7 and @xmath1 cover the whole @xmath4 .",
    "however , in the theory of defects considered in the next sections , the situation is different .",
    "generally , the elastic medium fills the whole euclidean space only in the final state . here and in",
    "what follows , we assume that fields depend on coordinates @xmath8 that are coordinates of points of the medium after the deformation and cover the whole euclidean space @xmath4 . in the presence of dislocations ,",
    "the coordinates @xmath1 do not cover the whole @xmath4 in the general case because part of the media may be removed or , conversely , added .",
    "therefore , the system of coordinates related to points of the medium after an elastic deformation and defect creation is more preferable .    in the linear elasticity theory ,",
    "relative deformations are assumed to be small ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath10 are then components of a vector field that is called the displacement vector field and is the basic variable in elasticity theory .    in the absence of defects , we assume that the displacement field is a smooth vector field in the euclidean space @xmath4 . the presence of discontinuities and singularities of the displacement field is interpreted as a presence of defects in elastic media .    in what follows , we consider only static deformations with the displacement field @xmath11 independent of time",
    ". then the basic equations of equilibrium for small deformations are ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the stress tensor , which is assumed to be symmetric .",
    "the tensor of small deformations @xmath14 is given by the symmetrized partial derivative of the displacement vector : @xmath15 lowering and raising of the latin indices is performed with the euclidean metric @xmath16 and its inverse @xmath17 . the letters @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote constants characterizing elastic properties of media and are called lam coefficients . functions",
    "@xmath20 describe the total density of nonelastic forces inside the medium .",
    "we assume in what follows that such forces are absent : @xmath21 .",
    "equation ( [ estati ] ) is newton s law , and eqn ( [ ehook ] ) is hook s law relating stresses to deformations .    in a cartesian coordinate system and for small deformations",
    ", the difference between upper and lower indices disappears because raising and lowering of indices is performed with the help of the euclidean metric .",
    "one usually forgets about this difference due to this reason , and this is fully justified .",
    "but in the presence of defects , the notion of cartesian coordinate system and euclidean metric is absent , and the indices are raised and lowered with the help of riemannian metric .",
    "therefore , we distinguish the upper and lower indices as is accepted in differential geometry , having the transition to elastic media with defects in mind .",
    "the main problem in the linear elasticity theory is the solution of the second - order equations for the displacement vector that arise after substitution of ( [ ehook ] ) into ( [ estati ] ) with some boundary conditions .",
    "many known solutions are in good agreement with experiment .",
    "therefore , one may say that equations ( [ ehook ] ) , ( [ estati ] ) have a solid experimental background .",
    "we now look at the elastic deformations from the standpoint of differential geometry . from the mathematical standpoint , map ( [ eeldef ] )",
    "is itself a diffeomorphism of the euclidean space @xmath4 .",
    "the euclidean metric @xmath16 is then induced by the map @xmath22 .",
    "it means that in the deformed state , the metric in the linear approximation is given by @xmath23 i.e. , is defined by the tensor of small deformations ( [ edefte ] ) .",
    "we note that in the linear approximation , @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ".    in riemannian geometry , the metric uniquely defines the levi  civita connection @xmath26 ( christoffel s symbols ) , eqn ( [ etigam ] ) .",
    "we can compute curvature tensor ( [ ecurva ] ) for these symbols .",
    "this tensor equals identically zero , @xmath27 , because the curvature of the euclidean space is zero , and the map @xmath22 is a diffeomorphism .",
    "the torsion tensor is equal to zero for the same reason .",
    "thus , an elastic deformation of the medium corresponds to the trivial riemann ",
    "cartan geometry , with zero curvature and torsion tensors .",
    "the physical interpretation of metric ( [ emetri ] ) is as follows .",
    "the external observer fixes cartesian coordinate system corresponding to the ground undeformed state of the medium .",
    "the medium is then deformed , and external observer discovers that the metric becomes nontrivial in this coordinate system . if we assume that elastic perturbations in the medium ( phonons ) propagate along extremals ( lines of minimal length ) , then their trajectories in the deformed medium are defined by eqns ( [ exteqr ] ) .",
    "trajectories of phonons are now not straight lines because the christoffel s symbols are nontrivial ( @xmath28 ) . in this sense ,",
    "metric ( [ emetri ] ) is observable . here , we see the essential role of the cartesian coordinate system @xmath1 defined by the undeformed state , with which the measurement process is connected .",
    "we assume that the metric @xmath29 given in the cartesian coordinates corresponds to some state of elastic media without defects .",
    "the displacement vector is then defined by the system of equations ( [ emetri ] ) , and its integrability conditions are the equality of the curvature tensor to zero , in accordance with theorem [ tlocev ] in the appendix . in the linear approximation ,",
    "these conditions are known in elasticity theory as the saint ",
    "venant integrability conditions .",
    "we make a remark that is important for the following consideration . for appropriate boundary conditions",
    ", the solution of the elasticity theory equations ( [ estati ] ) , ( [ ehook ] ) is unique . from the geometric standpoint ,",
    "this means that elasticity theory fixes diffeomorphisms .",
    "this fact is used in the geometric theory of defects .",
    "equations of nonlinear elasticity theory written in terms of the metric or vielbein are used for fixing the coordinate system .",
    "we start with the description of linear dislocations in elastic media ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest and most undespread examples of linear dislocations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fdislo ] .",
    "we cut the medium along the half - plane @xmath30 , @xmath31 , move the upper part of the medium located over the cut @xmath32 , @xmath31 by the vector @xmath33 towards the dislocation axis @xmath34 , and glue the cutting surfaces .",
    "the vector @xmath33 is called the burgers vector . in the general case ,",
    "the burgers vector may not be constant on the cut .",
    "for the edge dislocation , it varies from zero to some constant value @xmath33 as it moves from the dislocation axis . after the gluing ,",
    "the media comes to the equilibrium state called the edge dislocation , see fig .",
    "[ fdislo]_a_. if the burgers vector is parallel to the dislocation line , it is called the screw dislocation ( fig .",
    "[ fdislo]_b _ ) .",
    "the same dislocation can be made in different ways .",
    "for example , if the burgers vector is perpendicular to the cutting plane and directed from it in the considered cases , then the produced cavity must be filled with medium before gluing .",
    "it is easy to imagine that the edge dislocation is also obtained as a result , but rotated by the angle @xmath35 around the @xmath34 axis .",
    "this example shows that a dislocation is characterized not by the cutting surface but by the dislocation line and the burgers vector .     straight linear dislocations .",

    "in contrast to the case of elastic deformations , the displacement vector in the presence of dislocations is no longer a smooth function because of the presence of cutting surfaces . at the same time",
    ", we assume that partial derivatives of the displacement vector @xmath36 ( the distortion tensor ) are smooth functions on the cutting surface . this assumption is justified physically because these derivatives define deformation tensor ( [ edefte ] ) . in its turn",
    ", partial derivatives of the deformation tensor must exist and be smooth functions in the equilibrium state everywhere except , possibly , the dislocation axis , because otherwise equations of equilibrium ( [ estati ] ) have no meaning .",
    "we assume that the metric and vielbein are smooth functions everywhere in @xmath4 except , may be , dislocation axes , because the deformation tensor defines the induced metric ( [ emetri ] ) .",
    "the main idea of the geometric approach amounts to the following . to describe single dislocations in the framework of elasticity theory",
    "we must solve equations for the displacement vector with some boundary conditions on the cuts .",
    "this is possible for small number of dislocations .",
    "but , with an increasing number of dislocations , the boundary conditions become so complicated that the solution of the problem becomes unrealistic . besides , one and",
    "the same dislocation can be created by different cuts which leads to an ambiguity in the displacement vector field .",
    "another shortcoming of this approach is that it can not be applied to the description of a continuous distribution of dislocations because the displacement vector field does not exist in this case at all because it must have discontinuities at every point . in the geometric approach ,",
    "the basic variable is the vielbein which by assumption is a smooth function everywhere except , possibly , dislocation axes .",
    "we postulate new equations for the vielbein ( see section [ sequil ] ) . in the geometric approach ,",
    "the transition from a finite number of dislocations to their continuous distribution is simple and natural . in that way",
    ", the smoothing of singularities occurs on dislocation axes in analogy with smoothing of mass distribution for point particles in passing to continuous media .",
    "we now develop the formalism of the geometric approach . in a general defect - present case",
    ", we do not have a preferred cartesian coordinate frame in the equilibrium because there is no symmetry .",
    "therefore , we consider arbitrary coordinates @xmath37 , @xmath38 , in @xmath4 .",
    "we use greek letters for coordinates allowing arbitrary coordinate changes .",

    "here , components of the displacement vector field @xmath42 are considered with respect to the orthonormal basis in the tangent space , @xmath43 . if components of the displacement vector field are considered with respect to the coordinate basis @xmath44 , the invariance of the integral ( [ eburge ] ) under general coordinate changes is violated .    in the geometric approach ,",
    "we introduce new independent variable  the vielbein  instead of partial derivatives",
    "@xmath45 @xmath46 the vielbein is a smooth function on the cut by construction .",
    "we note that if the vielbein was simply defined as the partial derivative @xmath47 , then it would have the @xmath48-function singularity on the cut because functions @xmath49 have a jump .",
    "the burgers vector can be expressed through the integral over a surface @xmath50 having contour @xmath40 as the boundary @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the surface element . as a consequence of the definition of the vielbein in ( [ edevid ] ) , the integrand is equal to zero everywhere except at the dislocation axis . for the edge dislocation with constant burgers vector ,",
    "the integrand has a @xmath48-function singularity at the origin .",
    "the criterion for the presence of a dislocation is a violation of the integrability conditions for the system of equations @xmath53 : @xmath54 if dislocations are absent , then the functions @xmath49 exist and define transformation to a cartesian coordinates frame .    in the geometric theory of defects , the field @xmath55",
    "is identified with the vielbein .",
    "next , we compare the integrand in ( [ eburg2 ] ) with the expression for the torsion in cartan variables ( [ ecurcv ] ) .",
    "they differ only by terms containing the @xmath0 connection .",
    "this is the ground for the introduction of the following postulate . in the geometric theory of defects ,",
    "the burgers vector corresponding to a surface @xmath50 is defined by the integral of the torsion tensor : @xmath56 this definition is invariant with respect to general coordinate transformations of @xmath37 and covariant with respect to global rotations .",
    "thus , the torsion tensor has straightforward physical interpretation : it is equal to the surface density of the burgers vector .    the physical interpretation of the @xmath0 connection is given in section [ sdiscl ] , and now we show how this definition reduces to the expression for the burgers vector ( [ eburg2 ] ) obtained within elasticity theory .",
    "if the curvature tensor for the @xmath0 connection is zero , then , according to theorem [ tlotrs ] , the connection is locally trivial , and there exists such @xmath0 rotation such that @xmath57 . in this case",
    ", we return to expression ( [ eburg2 ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath0 connection is zero and vielbein is a smooth function , then the burgers vector corresponds uniquely to every contour .",
    "it can then be expressed as a surface integral of the torsion tensor .",
    "the surface integral depends only on the boundary contour but not on the surface due to the stokes theorem .",
    ".45    we have shown that the presence of linear defects results in a nontrivial torsion tensor . in the geometric theory of defects , the equality of the torsion tensor to zero @xmath58 is naturally considered the criterion for the absence of dislocations . then , under the name dislocation fall not only linear dislocations but , in fact , arbitrary defects in elastic media . for example , point defects ; vacancies and impurities , are also dislocations . in the first case we cut out a ball from the euclidean space @xmath4 and",
    "then shrink the boundary sphere to a point ( fig .",
    "[ fpoide ] ) . in the case of impurity , a point of the euclidean space is blown up to a sphere and the produced cavity is filled with the medium .",
    "point defects are characterized by the mass of the removed or added media , which is also defined by the vielbein @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath49 are the transition functions to a cartesian coordinate frame in @xmath4 and @xmath60 is the density of the medium which is supposed to be constant .",
    "the mass is defined by the difference of two integrals , each of them being separately divergent .",
    "the first integral equals to the volume of the medium with defects and the second is equal to the volume of the euclidean space .",
    "the torsion tensor for a vacancy or impurity is zero everywhere except at one point , where it has a @xmath48-function singularity . for point defects ,",
    "the notion of the burgers vector is absent .    according to the given definition ,",
    "the mass of an impurity is positive because the matter is added to the media , and the mass of a vacancy is negative because part of the medium is removed .",
    "the negative sign of the mass causes serious problems for a physical interpretation of solutions of the equations of motion or the schrdinger equation .",
    "hence , we make a remark . strictly speaking , the integral ( [ emass ] )",
    "should be called the `` bare '' mass because this expression does not account for elastic stresses arising around a point dislocation .",

    "we identify the field @xmath94 with the @xmath0 connection . in the expression for the curvature in ( [ ecucav ] ) ,",
    "the first two terms coincide with ( [ eomcon ] ) , and we therefore postulate the covariant criterion of the absence of disclinations as the equality of the curvature tensor for the @xmath0 connection to zero : @xmath98 simultaneously , we give the physical interpretation of the curvature tensor as the surface density of the frank vector @xmath99 this definition reduces to the previous expression for the frank vector ( [ efrank ] ) in the case where rotation of the vector @xmath78 occures in a fixed plane . in this case , rotations are restricted by the subgroup @xmath100 .",
    "the quadratic terms in the expression for the curvature in ( [ ecucav ] ) disappear because the rotation group @xmath101 is abelian , and we obtain the previous expression for the frank vector ( [ efrank ] ) .",
    "thus , we described the media with dislocations ( defects of elastic media ) and disclinations ( defects in the spin structure ) in the framework of riemann  cartan geometry , the torsion and curvature tensors being identified with the surface density of dislocations and disclinations , respectively .",
    "the relations between physical and geometrical notions are summarized in the table  [ tdegeo ] .",
    ".[tdegeo ] the relation between physical and geometrical notions in the geometric theory of defects . [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the same physical interpretation of torsion and curvature was considered in @xcite .",
    "several possible functionals for the free energy were also considered . in the next section ,",
    "we propose a new expression for the free energy .",
    "until now , we discussed only the relation between physical and geometrical notions . to complete the construction of the geometric theory of defects , we have to postulate equations of equilibrium describing static distribution of defects in media . the vielbein @xmath55 and @xmath0 connection @xmath94 are basic and independent variables in the geometric approach .",
    "in contrast to previous geometric approaches , we completely abandon the displacement field @xmath11 and spin structure @xmath70 as the fields entering the system of equilibrium equations . in a general case of a continuous distribution of defects ,",
    "they simply do not exist .",
    "nevertheless , at some level and under definite circumstances they can be reconstructed , and we discuss this in the following section .",
    "the expression for the free energy was derived in @xcite .",
    "we assume that equations of equilibrium must be covariant under general coordinate transformations and local rotations , be at most of the second order , and follow from a variational principle .",
    "the expression for the free energy leading to the equilibrium equations must then be equal to a volume integral of the scalar function ( the lagrangian ) that is quadratic in torsion and curvature tensors .",
    "there are three independent invariants quadratic in the torsion tensor and three independent invariants quadratic in the curvature tensor in three dimensions .",
    "it is possible to add the scalar curvature and a `` cosmological '' constant @xmath102 .",
    "we thus obtain a general eight - parameter lagrangian @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are some constants , and we have introduced the trace of torsion tensor @xmath107 and the ricci tensor @xmath108 . here and in",
    "what follows , transformation of the greek indices into the latin ones and vice versa is always performed using the vielbein and its inverse .",
    "for example , @xmath109 the particular feature of three dimensions is that the full curvature tensor is in a one - to - one correspondence with ricci tensor ( [ ecurir ] ) and has three irreducible components .",
    "therefore , the lagrangian contains only three independent invariants quadratic in curvature tensor . we do not need to add the hilbert ",
    "einstein lagrangian @xmath110 , also yielding second - order equations , to the free energy ( [ egenla ] ) because of identity ( [ eidcur ] ) .",
    "thus , the most general lagrangian depends on eight constants and leads to very complicated equations of equilibrium .",
    "at present , we do not know precisely what values of the constants describe this or that medium .",
    "therefore , we make physically reasonable assumptions to simplify matters .",
    "namely , we require that equations of equilibrium must admit the following three types of solutions .    1 .",
    "there are solutions describing the media with only dislocations , @xmath111 .",
    "2 .   there are solutions describing the media with only disclinations , @xmath112 .",
    "3 .   there are solutions describing the media without dislocations and disclinations , @xmath113 .",
    "it turns out that these simple assumptions reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two .",
    "we now prove this statement .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ egenla ] ) yields the equilibrium equations @xmath114 where the covariant derivative acts with the @xmath0 connection on the latin indices and with the christoffel symbols on the greek ones .",
    "for example , @xmath115    the first condition on the class of solutions of the equilibrium equations is that they permit solutions describing the presence of only dislocations in media .",
    "this means the existence of solutions with zero curvature tensor corresponding to the absence of disclinations .",
    "substitution of the condition @xmath116 into eqn ( [ econne ] ) for the @xmath117 connection yields @xmath118 here @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 are the irreducible components of the torsion tensor , @xmath122 where @xmath123    in a general case of dislocations all irreducible components of torsion tensor differ from zero ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath124 ) and eqns ( [ ecotor ] ) have a unique solution @xmath125 for these coupling constants , the first four terms in lagrangian ( [ egenla ] ) are equal to the hilbert ",
    "einstein lagrangian @xmath126 up to a total divergence due to identity ( [ eidcur ] ) . equation ( [ etriad ] ) then reduces to the einstein equations with a cosmological constant @xmath127 in this way , the first condition is satisfied .    according to the second condition",
    ", the equations of equilibrium must allow solutions with zero torsion @xmath58 . in this case , the curvature tensor has additional symmetry @xmath128 , and eqn ( [ econne ] ) becomes @xmath129 here , we decompose the ricci tensor onto irreducible components , @xmath130 where @xmath131 note that for zero torsion , the ricci tensor is symmetrical : @xmath132 .",
    "contraction of eqn ( [ econre ] ) with @xmath133 leads to the equation @xmath134 in the general case of nonvanishing curvature , the covariant derivatives @xmath135 and @xmath136 differ from zero and are independent .",
    "therefore , we obtain two equations for the coupling constants , @xmath137 which have a unique solution @xmath138 in this case , eqn ( [ etriad ] ) for the vielbein corresponding to a nonzero torsion also reduces to einstein equations ( [ eeinst ] ) .    the last requirement for the existence of solutions with zero curvature and torsion",
    "is satisfied only for the zero cosmological constant @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , the simple and physically reasonable requirements define the two parameter lagrangian @xcite @xmath140 which is the sum of the hilbert ",
    "einstein lagrangian for the vielbein and the square of the antisymmetric part of the ricci tensor .",
    "we note that @xmath141 and @xmath142 are constructed for different metrical connections .",
    "other quadratic lagrangians were considered , for example , in @xcite .",
    "we note that they also contain the displacement vector as an independent variable along with the vielbein .    expression ( [ elagfi ] ) defines the free energy density in the geometric theory of defects and leads to the equilibrium equations ( the euler ",
    "lagrange equations ) . in our geometric approach",
    ", the displacement vector and spin structure do not enter expression ( [ elagfi ] ) for the free energy .",
    "in the geometric approach , the vielbein @xmath55 and @xmath0 connection @xmath143 are the only variables .",
    "the displacement field @xmath11 and the spin structure @xmath144 can be introduced only in those regions of media where defects are absent .",
    "as the consequence of the absence of disclinations @xmath145 , the @xmath0 connection is actually a pure gauge ( [ eloctr ] ) , i.e. , the spin structure @xmath144 exists .",
    "if , in addition , dislocations are absent ( @xmath58 ) then there is the displacement field such that the vielbein equals its partial derivatives ( [ erepad ] ) . in this and only in this case can we introduce the displacement field and spin structure .",
    "we show below that this can be done such that the equations of nonlinear elasticity theory and the principal chiral @xmath0 field are fulfilled .    for free energy in ( [ elagfi ] ) , the euler  lagrange equations",
    "are covariant under general coordinate transformations in @xmath4 and local @xmath0 rotations .",
    "this means that any solution of the equilibrium equations is defined up to diffeomorphisms and local rotations . for the geometric theory of defects to make predictions",
    ", we have to fix the coordinate system ( to fix the gauge in the language of gauge field theory ) .",
    "this allows us to choose a unique representative from each class of equivalent solutions .",
    "we say afterwards that this solution of the euler ",
    "lagrange equations describes the distribution of defects in the laboratory coordinate system .",
    "we start with gauge - fixing the diffeomorphisms . for this , we choose the elastic gauge proposed in @xcite .",
    "this question is of primary importance , and we discuss it in detail .    equations ( [ estati ] ) , ( [ ehook ] ) of elasticity theory for @xmath146 yield the second - order equation for the displacement vector @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the poisson ratio , ( @xmath149 ) , and @xmath150 is the laplace operator . it can be rewritten in terms of the induced metric ( [ emetri ] ) , for which we obtain a first - order equation .",
    "we choose precisely this equation as the gauge condition fixing the diffeomorphisms .",
    "we note that the gauge condition is not uniquely defined because the induced metric is nonlinear in the displacement vector , and different equations for the metric may have the same linear approximation .",
    "we give two possible choices , @xmath151 where we introduced the notation for the trace of metric @xmath152 .",
    "gauge conditions ( [ eonead ] ) and ( [ etwoad ] ) are understood in the following way .",
    "the metric @xmath153 is the euclidean metric written in an arbitrary coordinate system , for example , in the cylindrical or spherical coordinate system .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath154 is built from the christoffel symbols corresponding to the metric @xmath153 , and @xmath155 as a consequence .",
    "the metric @xmath156 is the metric describing dislocations [ an exact solution of the equilibrium equations for the free energy ( [ elagfi ] ) ] .",
    "the gauge conditions differ because in the first and second cases the contraction is performed with the metric of dislocation @xmath157 and the euclidean metric @xmath158 , respectively , without changing the linear approximation .",
    "both gauge conditions yield eqn ( [ eqsepu ] ) in the linear approximation in the displacement vector ( [ emetri ] ) .",
    "this is most easily verified in cartesian coordinates .    from the geometric standpoint , we have the following .",
    "the medium with dislocations is diffeomorphic to the euclidean space @xmath4 equipped with two metrics @xmath153 and @xmath156 .",
    "the metric @xmath153 is a flat euclidean metric written in an arbitrary coordinate system .",
    "the metric @xmath156 is not flat and describes the distribution of dislocations in the same coordinate system .",
    "in fact , the metric @xmath153 is used only to fix the coordinate system in which the metric @xmath156 is measured .",
    "if the solution of the equilibrium equations satisfies one of the gauge conditions ( [ eonead ] ) , ( [ etwoad ] ) , written , for example , in cylindrical coordinate system then we say that the solution is found in the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we suppose here that the distribution of dislocations in elastic media in the laboratory cylindrical coordinate system is described by this particular solution .",
    "analogously , we may seek solutions in a cartesian , spherical , or any other coordinate system .",
    "gauge conditions may also be written for the vielbein @xmath55 , which is defined by eqn ( [ etetra ] ) .",
    "this involves additional arbitrariness because the vielbein is defined up to local rotations .",
    "this invariance leads to different linear approximations for the vielbein in terms of the displacement vector .",
    "we consider two possibilities in cartesian coordinates : @xmath159 where the index is lowered with the help of the kronecker symbol .",
    "for these possibilities and gauge condition ( [ etwoad ] ) we have two gauge conditions for the vielbein @xmath160 where @xmath161 .",
    "these conditions differ in the coefficient before the second term .",
    "we note that in a curvilinear coordinate system , the covariant derivative @xmath154 must also include the flat @xmath0 connection acting on indices @xmath162 .",
    "one can also write other possible gauge conditions having the same linear approximation .",
    "the question of the correct choice is unanswered at present and outside the scope of this review . at the moment , we want only to demonstrate that the system of coordinates must be fixed , and that the gauge condition depends on the poisson ratio , which is the experimentally observed quantity",
    ".    gauge conditions ( [ ethrad])([efouad ] ) are first order equations by themselves and have some arbitrariness .",
    "therefore , to fix a solution uniquely , we must impose additional boundary conditions on the vielbein for any given problem .    if the defect - free case , @xmath58 , @xmath163 , and the equilibrium equations are satisfied because the euler  lagrange equations for ( [ elagfi ] ) are satisfied . in this and only in this case , we can introduce a displacement vector , and the elastic gauge reduces to the equations of nonlinear elasticity theory . in the presence of defects ,",
    "a displacement field does not exist , and the elastic gauge simply defines the vielbein .    in choosing the free energy functional , we required that the conditions @xmath116 and @xmath58 satisfy the euler ",
    "lagrange equations .",
    "this is important because otherwise we would obtain an additional condition on the displacement vector ( the euler  lagrange equations ) besides the elasticity theory equations following from the elastic gauge .",
    "we stress an important point once again . in the geometric theory of defects",
    ", we assume that there is a preferred laboratory coordinate system in which measurements are made .",
    "this coordinate system is related to the medium without defects and elastic stresses and corresponds to the flat euclidean space @xmath4 .",
    "gauge conditions ( [ eonead ] ) , ( [ etwoad ] ) and ( [ ethrad ] ) , ( [ efouad ] ) are written precisely in this euclidean space @xmath4 and contain a measurable quantity , the poisson ratio @xmath164 .",
    "this property essentially distinguishes the geometric theory of defects from the models of gravity in which all coordinate systems are considered equivalent .",
    "the elastic gauge is used to fix diffeomorphisms .",
    "the expression for the free energy in ( [ elagfi ] ) is also invariant under local @xmath0 rotations , and they must also be fixed . for this , we recently proposed the lorentz gauge for the connection @xcite @xmath165 this gauge is written in the laboratory cartesian coordinate system and has deep physical meaning .",
    "that is , let disclinations be absent ( @xmath163 ) . then the @xmath0 connection is a pure gauge : @xmath166 in this case , the lorentz gauge reduces to the principal chiral @xmath0-field equations @xmath167 for the spin structure @xmath92 . principal chiral field models ( see , e.g. , [ 6468 ] ) for different groups and in a different number of dimensions attract much interest in mathematical physics because they admit solutions of topological soliton types and find broad applications in physics .",
    "thus , the lorentz gauge ( [ elorga ] ) means the following . in the absence of disclinations ,",
    "equations of equilibrium are identically satisfied , and there exists a field @xmath70 that satisfies equations for the principal chiral field . by this",
    "we mean that the spin structure of the medium is described by the model of the principal chiral field in the defect - free case .",
    "the principal chiral field model is not the only one that can be used for fixing local rotations .",
    "the skyrme model @xcite can also be used for this purpose .",
    "the euler ",
    "lagrange equations for this model are not difficult to rewrite in terms of the @xmath0 connection and use as the gauge conditions .",
    "there are other models for spin structures . for describing the distribution of magnetic moments in ferromagnets or the director field in liquid crystals ,",
    "one uses the expression for the free energy depending on the vector @xmath78-field itself @xcite . lately , much attention is paid to the faddeev model of the @xmath78-field @xcite . the question whether there are gauge conditions on the @xmath0 connection that yield these models in the absence of disclinations is unanswered at present .",
    "thus , we pose the following problem in the geometric theory of defects : to find the solution of the euler  lagrange equations for free energy ( [ elagfi ] ) that satisfies the elastic gauge for the vielbein and the lorentz gauge for the @xmath0 connection . in sections [ swedie ] and [ swegeo ] , we solve this problem for the wedge dislocation in the framework of the classical elasticity theory and the geometric theory of defects , respectively , and afterwards compare the obtained results .",
    "in the preceeding section , we used the elasticity theory and the principal chiral @xmath0-field model to fix the invariance of free energy ( [ elagfi ] ) in the geometric theory of defects .",
    "this is not a unique possibility , because other models may be used for gauge fixing . in the present section ,",
    "we show how another model ",
    "asymmetric elasticity theory  can be used for fixing diffeomorphisms and local rotations .    at the beginning of the last century",
    ", the cosserat brothers developed the theory of elastic media , every point of which is characterized not only be its position but also by its orientation in space @xcite , i.e. , a vielbein is specified at every point ( fig.[fcosme ] ) .",
    ".45    from physical standpoint , this means that every atom in the crystalline structure is not a point but an extended object having orientation . in this case , the stress tensor is no longer a symmetric tensor , and the corresponding theory is called the asymmetric elasticity theory .",
    "contemporary exposition of this approach is given in @xcite .",
    "in the present section , we show that the asymmetric theory of elasticity is naturally incorporated into the geometric theory of defects .",
    "the main variables in the asymmetric theory of elasticity are the displacement vector @xmath42 and the rotation angle @xmath168 .",
    "the direction of the pseudovector @xmath74 coincides with the rotation axis of the medium element and its length is equal to the angle of rotation .",
    "the angle of rotation discussed in section [ sdiscl ] is dual to the spin structure field @xmath92 : @xmath169 .",
    "the cosserat medium is characterized by the stress tensor @xmath170 ( the density of forces acting on the surface with normal @xmath171 in the direction @xmath172 ) and the torque stress tensor @xmath173 ( the density of torques acting on the surface with normal @xmath171 in the direction @xmath172 ) .",
    "the cosserat medium is in equilibrium if forces and torques are balanced at every point , @xmath174 where @xmath20 and @xmath175 are the densities of nonelastic external forces and torques . as a consequence of eqn ( [ emofor ] ) ,",
    "the stress tensor is symmetric if and only if the condition @xmath176 is satisfied .",
    "the displacement field and rotation angle uniquely define the deformation tensor @xmath177 and the twist tensor @xmath178 : @xmath179 in general , the deformation and twist tensors have no symmetry in their indices .",
    "hook s law in the cosserat medium is changed to two linear relations connecting the stress and torque tensors with the deformation and twist tensors , @xmath180}+{\\lambda}{\\delta}_{ij}\\e_k{}^k , \\\\",
    "\\label{esizkr }    \\mu_{ij}&=2\\g\\kappa_{\\lbrace ij\\rbrace}+2\\e\\kappa_{[ij ] }    + { \\beta}{\\delta}_{ij}\\kappa_k{}^k,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath181 are the lam coefficients , and @xmath182 are four new elastic constants characterizing the medium .",
    "braces and square brackets denote symmetrization and antisymmetrization of indices , respectively .    in the case where @xmath183 the deformation tensor is symmetric and has the previous form ( [ edefte ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ emofor ] ) , together with ( [ estrte ] ) and ( [ esizkr ] ) , then reduces to the equation @xmath184 the first term vanishes as a consequence of eqn ( [ eqsepu ] ) .",
    "thus , for spin structure ( [ eresye ] ) and @xmath185 we return to the symmetric elasticity theory .",
    "equations ( [ enewfo ] ) , ( [ emofor ] ) , ( [ estrte ] ) , and ( [ esizkr ] ) , together with the boundary conditions , define the equilibrium state of cosserat media .",
    "we now show how this model is included in the geometric theory .",
    "first , we note that in the absence of defects ( @xmath58 , @xmath116 ) , the fields @xmath11 and @xmath70 exist .",
    "then the vielbein and the @xmath0 connection are defined by the deformation and twist tensors in the linear approximation : @xmath186    we note that relations ( [ edeizk ] ) can be regarded as equations for the displacement vector and rotation angle .",
    "the corresponding integrability conditions were obtained in @xcite .",
    "these integrability conditions are the linear approximations of equalities @xmath58 and @xmath116 defining the absence of defects .",
    "if nonelastic forces and torques are absent ( @xmath146 , @xmath185 ) , then the asymmetric theory of elasticity reduces to second - order equations for the displacement vector and rotation angle : @xmath187 we rewrite these equations for the vielbein and @xmath0 connection @xmath188 of course , these are not the only equations that coincide with eqns ( [ eqtrfi ] ) and ( [ eqstco ] ) in the linear approximation . at present , we do not have arguments for the unique choice .",
    "the derived nonlinear equations of the asymmetric elasticity theory can be used as gauge conditions in the geometric theory of defects . here , we have six equations for fixing diffeomorphisms ( three parameters ) and local @xmath0 rotations ( three parameters ) .",
    "thus , the asymmetric theory of elasticity is naturally embedded in the geometric theory of defects .    in section [ sfixga ] , we considered the elastic gauge for the vielbein and the lorentz gauge for the @xmath0 connection . in this case",
    ", the spin structure variables do not interact with elastic deformations when defects are absent . in the asymmetric elasticity theory ,",
    "the elastic stresses directly influence the spin structure and vice versa .",
    ".45    by wedge dislocation , we understand an elastic medium that is topologically the euclidean space @xmath4 without the @xmath189 axis  the core of dislocation , obtained in the following way .",
    "we consider the infinite elastic medium without defects and cut out the infinite wedge of angle @xmath190 . for definiteness",
    ", we assume that the edge of the wedge coincides with the @xmath191 axis ( fig.[fwedis ] ) .",
    "the edges of the cut are then moved symmetrically one to the other and glued together .",
    "after that , the medium moves to the equilibrium state under the action of elastic forces .",
    "if the wedge is cut out from the medium , then the angle is considered negative : @xmath192 . for positive @xmath193 , the wedge is added .",
    "thus , the elastic medium initially occupies a domain greater or lesser than the euclidean space @xmath4 , depending on the sign of the deficit angle @xmath193 ; in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath194 this domain is described by the inequalities @xmath195    we note that the wedge dislocation is often called disclination . in our approach , this term seems unnatural because the wedge dislocation is related to a nontrivial torsion .",
    "moreover , the term disclination is used for defects in the spin structure .",
    "we now proceed with the mathematical formulation of the problem for the wedge dislocation in the framework of elasticity theory . to avoid divergent expressions arising for infinite media ,",
    "we suppose that the wedge dislocation is represented by the cylinder of a finite radius @xmath196 .",
    "this problem has translational symmetry along the @xmath191 axis and rotational symmetry in the @xmath197 plane .",
    "therefore , we use cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "let @xmath198 be the components of the displacement covector with respect to orthonormal basis in the cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "this covector satisfies the equilibrium equation following the substitution of ( [ ehook ] ) in eqn ( [ estati ] ) in domain ( [ ecylco ] ) , @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the covariant derivative for the flat euclidean metric in the considered coordinate system .    for references ,",
    "we write expressions for the divergence and laplacian for a covector field in the cylindrical coordinate system : @xmath201 taking the symmetry of the problem into account , we seek the solution of eqn ( [ qeeste ] ) in the form @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are two unknown functions depending only on the radius .",
    "we impose the boundary conditions : @xmath205 the first four equations are geometrical and correspond to the process of dislocation creation .",
    "the last condition has simple physical meaning : the absence of external forces at the boundary of the medium .",
    "the unknown function @xmath204 is found from the second to the last boundary condition ( [ ebocow ] ) @xmath206 straightforward substitution then shows that @xmath207 and @xmath191 components of equation of equilibrium ( [ qeeste ] ) are identically satisfied , and the radial component reduces to the equation @xmath208 the general solution of this equation is @xmath209 the constant of integration @xmath210 due to the boundary condition at zero .",
    "the constant @xmath211 is found from the last boundary condition in ( [ ebocow ] ) . finally , we obtain the known solution of the considered problem @xcite @xmath212 the letter @xmath213 in the expression for @xmath214 denotes the base of the natural logarithm .",
    "we note that the radial component of the displacement vector diverges as @xmath215 .",
    "this means that the description of the wedge dislocation requires considering a finite - radius cylinder .",
    "the linear elasticity theory is applicable for small relative displacements , which for a wedge dislocation are equal to @xmath216 this means that we are able to expect correct results for the displacement field for small deficit angles ( @xmath217 ) and near the boundary of the cylinder ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "we find the metric induced by the wedge dislocation in the linear approximation in the deficit angle @xmath193 .",
    "calculations can be performed using the general formulas ( [ emetri ] ) or the known expression for the variation of the form of the metric @xmath219 after simple calculations , we obtain the expression for the metric in the @xmath197 plane : @xmath220 this metric is compared with the metric obtained as the solution of three - dimensional einstein equations in section [ swegeo ] .",
    "wedge dislocations are relatively rarely met in nature because they require a much amount of a medium to be added or removed , resulting in a vast quantity of energy expenses . nevertheless , their study is of great importance because other linear dislocations can be expressed as a superposition of wedge dislocations . in this respect ,",
    "wedge dislocations are elementary .",
    "we show this for an edge dislocation ",
    "one of the most widely spread dislocations , as an example .",

    "the creation of a wedge dislocation coincides with the definition of conical singularity .",
    "however , there is a quantitative difference because metric ( [ ecosth ] ) depends only on the deficit angle @xmath193 and can not coincide with the induced metric ( [ emewed ] ) obtained within the elasticity theory . the difference arises because we require the displacement vector in the equilibrium to satisfy equilibrium equations after removing the wedge and gluing its edges ( creating conical singularity ) in the elasticity theory . at the same time",
    "the @xmath197 plane for a conical singularity after the gluing can be deformed in an arbitrary way .",

    "we transform the radial coordinate @xmath284 because a wedge dislocation is symmetric under rotations in the @xmath197 plane . after that transformation",
    "the vielbein components take the form @xmath285 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath272 .",

    "second , in the linear approximation in @xmath193 @xmath307 and metric ( [ emeweg ] ) can be easily shown to coincide precisely with metric ( [ emewed ] ) obtained within the elasticity theory .",
    "we see that induced metric ( [ emewed ] ) provides only the linear approximation for the metric obtained within the geometric theory of defects , which , in addition , has a simpler form . beyond the perturbation theory , we see essential differences .",
    "in particular , metric ( [ emewed ] ) is singular at the origin , whereas metric ( [ emeweg ] ) obtained beyound the perturbation theory is regular .",
    "the stress and deformation tensors are related by hook s law ( [ ehook ] ) .",
    "there is an experimental possibility to check formulas ( [ emeweg ] ) because the deformation tensor is the linear approximation for the induced metric . for this one has to measure the stress field for a single wedge dislocation . in this way , the geometric theory of defects can be experimentally confirmed or discarded .    the problem of reconstruction of the displacement field for a given metric reduces to solution of differential equations ( [ emetri ] ) with metric ( [ emeweg ] ) on the right hand side and boundary conditions ( [ ebocow ] ) .",
    "we do not discuss this problem here .",
    "we note that in the geometric theory of defects , a complicated stage of finding the displacement vector where it exists is simply absent and is not necessary .",
    "two - dimensional metric ( [ emeweg ] ) describes the conical singularity in the elastic gauge .",
    "the relation between conical singularities and wedge dislocations was established in [ 22,7880 ] . in these papers ,",
    "the metric was used in the other gauges ( coordinate systems ) .",
    "elastic oscillations in elastic media without defects are described by a time - dependent vector field @xmath308 that satisfies the wave equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath309 where dots denote differentiation with respect to time and @xmath60 is the mass density of medium , which is assumed to be constant .",
    "if the medium contains defects , then the metric of the space becomes nontrivial , @xmath310 .",

    "we recall that latin indices are lowered with the help of kronecker symbols , @xmath325 , and this operation commutes with covariant differentiation .",
    "equation ( [ edelop ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath326 because transformation of latin indices into greek ones commutes with the covariant differentiation , and the christoffel symbols are symmetrical in the first two indices .",

    "it is easily confirmed that eqn ( [ ephops ] ) for elastic oscillations is equivalent to two independent equations for transverse and longitudinal oscillations , @xmath328 where @xmath329 are the squares of sound velocities for transverse and longitudinal oscillations .",
    "particles arising after the secondary quantization of eqns ( [ eelaos ] ) are called phonons in solids .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , the problem of scattering of phonons on dislocations is a quantum mechanical one . in the present review ,",

    "however , there are no principal difficulties : the effect of dislocations reduces to a change in the metric .",

    "nonlinearity is introduced in elasticity theory in two ways .",
    "first , the deformation tensor is defined through the induced metric @xmath462 instead of being defined by linear relation ( [ edefte ] ) . then the stress tensor is given by an infinite series in the displacement vector .",
    "second , hook s law can be modified assuming nonlinear dependence of the stress tensor on the deformation tensor . hence , the elastic gauge condition is the equations of the nonlinear elasticity theory where the deformation tensor is assumed to be defined through the induced metric and hook s law is kept linear .",

    ", we considered the wedge dislocation from the standpoint of the elasticity theory and the geometric theory of defects .",
    "we showed that the elasticity theory reproduces only the linear approximation of the geometric approach .",

    "the problem is reduced to the analysis of extremals for the metric describing a given dislocation .",
    "equations for extremals are integrated explicitly , and the scattering angle is found .",
    "the second of the considered problems is the construction of the wave functions and energy spectrum of impurity in the presence of a wedge dislocation .",
    "this requires solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "this problem is mathematically equivalent to solving the schrdinger equation for bound states in the aharonov ",
    "bohm effect @xcite .",
    "the explicit dependence of the spectrum on the deficit angle and elastic properties of the medium is found in the presence of a wedge dislocation .",
    "the geometric theory of static distribution of defects can also be constructed for membranes , i.e. , on the plane @xmath85 . for this",
    ", one has to consider the euclidean version @xcite of two - dimensional gravity with torsion [ 8890 ] .",
    "this model is favored by its integrability [ 9194 ] .",
    "the developed geometric construction in the theory of defects can be inverted , and we can consider the gravitational interaction of masses in the universe as the interaction of defects in elastic ether .",
    "point masses and cosmic strings @xcite then correspond to point defects ( vacancies and impurities ) and wedge dislocations . in this interpretation of gravity",
    ", we have a question about the elastic gauge , which has direct physical meaning in the geometric theory of defects .",
    "if we take the standpoint of the theory of defects , then the elastic properties of ether correspond to some value of the poisson ratio , which can be measured experimentally .",
    "it seems interesting and important for applications to include time in the considered static approach for describing motion of defects in the medium .",
    "such a model is lacking at present . from the geometric standpoint",
    "this generalization can be easily performed , at least in principle .",
    "it is sufficient to change the euclidean space @xmath4 to the minkowski space @xmath463 and to write a suitable lagrangian quadratic in curvature and torsion , which corresponds to the true gravity model with torsion .",
    "one of the arising problems is the physical interpretation of the additional components of the vielbein and lorentz connection that contain the time index .",
    "the physical meaning of the time component of the vielbein @xmath464 is simple  this is the velocity of a point of the medium .",
    "this interpretation is natural from the physical standpoint because the motion of continuously distributed dislocations means a flowing of the medium .",
    "in fact , the liquid can be imagined as the elastic media with a continuous distribution of moving dislocations .",
    "this means that the dynamical theory of defects based on the riemann  cartan geometry must include hydrodynamics .",

    "if the scalar product is positive definite , we say that a riemannian metric is given on a manifold . by definition ,",
    "the metric is a covariant tensor field , i.e. , it transforms under coordinate changes @xmath41 by the tensor law @xmath475 this means that the scalar product of vector fields @xmath476 is a scalar field . in a similar way ,",
    "contractions with the metric @xmath156 and its inverse @xmath157 , @xmath477 , allows one to build scalar fields from higher - rank tensors or to lower their rank .",
    "the metric is also used for lowering and raising of tensor indices .",
    "an affine connection on a manifold in a local coordinate system is given by the set of coefficients @xmath478 that transform under the diffeomorphisms as @xmath479 these coefficients do not constitute a tensor field because of the presence of an inhomogeneous term in ( [ econts ] ) .",
    "an affine connection on a manifold defines covariant derivatives of tensor fields .",
    "in particular , covariant derivatives of a vector field and 1-form @xmath480 have the form @xmath481 the covariant derivative of a scalar field coincides with the partial derivative @xmath482 .",
    "the covariant derivative of higher - rank tensors is built in a similar way and contains one term with the plus and minus sign for each contravariant and covariant index , respectively .",
    "one can easily check that the covariant derivative of a tensor of an arbitrary type @xmath483 is a tensor field of type @xmath484 , i.e. , it has one additional covariant index .",
    "we note that the covariant derivative of a product of tensor fields may contain arbitrary contractions of indices .",
    "for example , @xmath485    because the inhomogeneous term in ( [ econts ] ) is symmetric in indices @xmath486 and @xmath487 the antisymmetric part of the affine connection @xmath488}{}^\\rho$ ] forms a tensor field of type @xmath489 , which is called the torsion tensor @xmath490    in general , the connection @xmath491 has no symmetry in its indices and is not related to the metric @xmath156 in any way because these notions define different geometric operations on a manifold @xmath467 .",
    "we then say that the affine geometry is given on @xmath467 .",
    "we emphasize that the metric and the affine connection are defined arbitrarily and are completely independent geometric notions .",
    "therefore , in the construction of physical models , they can be considered independent fields having different physical interpretations .",
    "if the affine geometry is given on a manifold , then we can construct the nonmetricity tensor @xmath492 that is by definition equal to the covariant derivative of the metric : @xmath493 by construction , the nonmetricity tensor is symmetric with respect to the permutation of the last two indices : @xmath494 .",
    "we note that we need both objects , the metric and the connection to define the nonmetricity .",

    "it is known that any manifold @xmath467 can be equipped with a riemannian metric ( see , for e.g. , @xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", the global existence of a vielbein provides , in particular , an orientation of the manifold @xmath467 .",
    "thus , a vielbein may exist globally only on orientable manifolds .",
    "there are also other topological restrictions for the global existence of a vielbein that we do not discuss here .",
    "the coordinate basis @xmath542 of the tangent space in every point of @xmath467 is called holonomic .",
    "components of tensors of an arbitrary type may also be considered with respect to the unholonomic basis @xmath313 of tangent spaces defined by the vielbein .",
    "for example , a vector field has the components @xmath543 we always assume that the transformation of greek indices into latin ones and vice versa is performed with the help of the vielbein .",
    "we now define the @xmath530 connection @xmath544 .",
    "this is the name of the connection of the principal fiber bundle with the structure lie group @xmath530 and the base @xmath467 .",
    "if the riemann - cartan geometry is given on @xmath467 , and the vielbein is defined , then we can define the @xmath530 connection by the relation @xmath545 we see that under coordinate changes , the components of @xmath546 transform as a covector field in the greek index .",
    "thus , they define a 1-form on @xmath467 . for a given vielbein",
    ", this relation provides a one - to - one correspondence between components of the connections @xmath491 and @xmath546 .",
    "the @xmath530 connection defines covariant derivatives for components of tensor fields relative to an unholonomic basis .",
    "for example , @xmath547 the covariant derivative is naturally defined for a tensor field having both greek and latin indices .",
    "taking the covariant derivative of eqn ( [ etetra ] ) leads to the antisymmetry of the components @xmath548 .",
    "this means that the 1-form @xmath549 takes values in the lie algebra @xmath550 , and this indeed corresponds to the @xmath530 connection .    in the general case of an affine geometry",
    ", the cartan variables can also be defined by relations ( [ etetra ] ) and ( [ etecov ] ) . for this",
    ", we have to replace the kronecker symbol on the right - hand side of ( [ etetra ] ) with an arbitrary nondegenerate symmetric matrix @xmath551 . in this case , relation ( [ etecov ] ) defines a linear @xmath552 connection . in the riemann",
    " cartan geometry with the lorentzian - signature metric , we would have the lorentz @xmath553 connection .",
    "we consider local rotations with a matrix @xmath554 to show that the components @xmath546 do define an @xmath530 connection in the riemann  cartan geometry . by definition ,",
    "the components of vector fields and 1-forms transform under local rotations according to the rule @xmath555 in order that covariant derivatives ( [ ecodve ] ) have the tensor transformation rule under local rotations , it is necessary and sufficient that the components of the @xmath530 connection transform according to the rule @xmath556 this is the transformation law for the @xmath530 connection , indeed .",
    "the same transformation law follows from definition ( [ etecov ] ) if the vielbein @xmath55 transforms as a vector with respect to the index @xmath171 , and the christoffel symbols remain unchanged .    of course",
    ", we can introduce the metrical and @xmath530 connections on @xmath467 in an independent way .",
    "if we require afterwards that the @xmath530 connection acts on tensor field components relative to an unholonomic basis defined by the vielbein , we obtain a one - to - one correspondence between the components of the connections ( [ etecov ] ) .",
    "we now express the components of the metric connection @xmath491 through the vielbein @xmath55 and @xmath530 connection @xmath546 with the help of relation ( [ etecov ] ) and substitute them into the definitions of torsion ( [ etorsi ] ) and curvature ( [ ecurva ] ) . as a result , we obtain expressions for torsion and curvature in terms of the cartan variables @xmath557 where @xmath558 torsion ( [ ecurcv ] ) and curvature ( [ ecucav ] ) are 2-forms on the manifold @xmath467 with the values in the vector space and lie algebra @xmath550 , respectively .",
    "an @xmath530 connection @xmath546 is called locally trivial if every point has a neighborhood containing this point such that it has the form @xmath559 obviously , after local rotation with the matrix @xmath560 , all components of the connection become zero .",
    "this connection is also called a pure gauge .",
    "one can easily verify that the curvature of a locally trivial connection identically vanishes .",
    "the inverse statement is also valid .",
    "this theorem is valid for any structure lie group .",
    "the proof is reduced to an analysis of transformation rule ( [ elocta ] ) .",
    "if the left - hand side of this equation is zero , then we have a system of equations for the field @xmath561 for which vanishing of curvature tensor is the local integrability condition .",
    "the space with zero curvature tensor @xmath163 is called the space of absolute parallelism because the parallel displacement of a vector does not depend on the path connecting two fixed points of the manifold .",
    "we can perform a local @xmath530 rotation for the locally trivial @xmath530 connection such that it becomes zero : @xmath562 . then",
    ", the zero - torsion equality becomes @xmath563 this equation is the local integrability condition for the system of equations @xmath564 for @xmath425 functions @xmath49 .",
    "a solution of this system of equations yields the transition functions to cartesian coordinates .",
    "thus , the equalities of curvature and torsion tensors to zero are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the fields @xmath561 and @xmath49 , i.e. , the existence of such a local rotation and coordinate system where the connection vanishes and the metric becomes euclidean .",
    "we note that equality of torsion tensor to zero alone is not enough for the existence of a cartesian coordinate system .",
    "three - dimensional space is considered in the geometric theory of defects .",
    "we make two remarks concerning this . in lower dimensions ,",

    ", we write the identity that is valid in the riemann  cartan geometry in an arbitrary number of dimensions : @xmath567 the riemannian scalar curvature on the right - hand side of this equality is constructed only from the vielbein for zero torsion .                        i.  a. kunin and b.  i. kunin .",
