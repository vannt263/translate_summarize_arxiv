    "[ f : accuracy ] we mitigate this problem by increasing the sampling frequency of the input data , and restricting the fourier transform to frequencies corresponding to instantaneous frequencies contained in the data .",

    "presumably , this is because of loss of phase accuracy over the course of the simulation .",
    "all three simulations begin with the same initial data , so the waveforms are most similar at the beginning .",
    "masses for which this is the most important segment ( the lowest masses ) will naturally have the highest overlap between resolutions .",
    "as the simulation progresses , numerical error accumulates  notably in the phase  so the overlap decreases with masses for which later segments dominate the overlap ( higher masses ) .",
    "when the overlap is optimized over arrival time and phase , we can see that the overlap becomes much better , as shown in the lower panel , indicating sufficient accuracy within any frequency band for which phase coherence is required . in either case , the medium and highest resolutions are much more nearly the same . without optimization ,",
    "their overlap is within a few tenths of a percent of 1 ; after optimization , the overlap is within @xmath69 of 1 .",
    "in the rest of our analysis we use the highest - resolution waveform . because we always optimize over arrival time and phase , the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ f : accuracy ] is the most relevant , and shows that the waveform has converged to very high accuracy .",
    "the overlaps we quote below will only be given to three decimal places at most , because this is roughly the accuracy of the single - precision numerical methods used in the rest of the paper .",
    "this accuracy is also sufficient for searches of gravitational - wave data .",
    "thus , the truncation error of the simulated waveform is irrelevant for those purposes .",
    "other sources of error include residual eccentricity and spin , the influence of the outer boundary of the simulation , extrapolation errors , and coordinate effects , as discussed in ref .",
    "the eccentricity had a disproportionately large effect on the error quoted in that paper because of the matching technique , which is not used here . restricting attention to the other effects of eccentricity",
    ", the uncertainty falls below that due to numerical error .",
    "similarly , using the techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite , the initial spins of the black holes have been measured more reliably , and found to be more than an order of magnitude smaller than previously determined , allowing us to reduce the estimate for that error to less than the numerical truncation error .",
    "the various coordinate effects were all estimated to be of roughly the same magnitude as the numerical error .    with the numerical error being many times more accurate than needed for this analysis , and the other sources of uncertainty being of roughly the same size , these considerations indicate that the overall error in our fiducial waveform is substantially less than the precision needed for this analysis",
    ".      numerical simulations can not simulate a very large portion of the inspiral of a black - hole binary system .",
    "indeed , the longest such simulation currently in the literature is the one used here  which extends over just 32 gravitational wave cycles before merger .",
    "fortunately , this is the only stage in which simulations are needed .",
    "it has been shown previously  @xcite that the _ taylort4 _ waveform with 3.5-pn phase and 3.0-pn amplitude matches the early part of this simulation to very high accuracy .",
    "we generate a _",
    "taylort4 _ waveform of over 8000 gravitational wave cycles ( @xmath70 , starting at @xmath71 ) , and transition between the two to create a hybrid .",
    "this long waveform is sufficient to ensure that  even for the lowest - mass systems we will consider  the waveform begins well before it enters the frequency band of interest to ligo .",
    "we begin with @xmath66 data , which will later be integrated to obtain @xmath17 . following ref .",

    "this particular interval is chosen to begin and end at troughs of the small oscillations due to the residual eccentricity @xmath75 in our numerical waveform .",
    "taking a range from trough to trough or peak to peak  rather than node to node , for example  of the eccentricity effects minimizes their influence on the matching .",
    "the eccentricity oscillations can be seen more easily after low - pass filtering the waveform , though we find filtering to be unnecessary for this paper .",
    "the junk radiation apparent in the waveform as shown here has no effect on the resulting match  as we have verified by filtering , and redoing the match . because the final waveform will incorporate no numerical data before @xmath76 and very little immediately thereafter ( as explained below )",

    "note that the agreement is well within the numerical accuracy of the simulation , represented by the horizontal bands , throughout the matching region .",

    "the optimal cutoff frequency for pseudo-4.0 pn templates is much closer to the weighted - average cutoff in this mass range.,title=\"fig : \" ]    our third recommendation involves the cutoff frequency used for the template waveform .",
    "optimization over the cutoff frequency is too computationally intensive to be done in searches .",
    "currently , the cutoff frequency is typically taken to be the schwarzschild isco frequency . to examine the effect of this choice we vary @xmath100 while keeping the mass and @xmath1 at their optimal values , for each of the signal masses in our range .",
    "the result of one such variation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : filterintegrand ] ( right ) . figs .",
    "[ fig : fcrecomendations ] shows the variations for all masses , highlighting the regions within which the overlap drops by less than 1% ( dark gray ) and 3% ( light gray ) of the optimal value .",
    "this figure also shows the isco and erd frequencies , neither of which stays within the 1% band for both initial and advanced ligo . in particular",
    ", the isco is a poor choice for both initial and advanced ligo except at very low masses , where the precise value of the cutoff is almost irrelevant .",
    "the isco is often pointed to  somewhat arbitrarily  as a good estimate of the breakdown of post - newtonian approximations  @xcite .",
    "so , for instance , if we were to match a pn template to a physical waveform , beginning at some point in the distant past , we might expect them to separate quite badly near the isco .",
    "of course , for realistic black - hole binaries , the gravitational waves will only enter the ligo band late in the inspiral  just before the isco for low - mass systems , or after the isco for high - mass systems .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : stildesandinitialpsd ] that , for masses below about @xmath129 , the isco is high enough that lower - frequency parts of the waveform contribute the most to the snr . for very high masses",
    ", however , this basically cuts the waveform down to nothing . in initial ligo",
    ", the isco is completely buried in seismic noise for masses above about @xmath132 .",
    "thus , we must move the cutoff frequency up .",
    "we can not push the cutoff far above ringdown , because the physical waveform simply ceases to exist ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stildesandinitialpsd ] ) .",
    "it has been suggested that an `` effective ringdown '' ( erd ) frequency @xmath51 is a useful upper limit  @xcite . for intermediate masses",
    ", we would like to interpolate somehow between these two extremes of isco and erd .",
    "we suggest setting the cutoff frequency to a weighted average of the two , where the weights are the contributions to the snr below the given frequency .",
    "if we assume coherent phasing between the template and the physical waveform , we can simply take the amplitudes of the two waveforms .",
    "also , note that the restricted spa approximation for the amplitude is reasonable .",
    "thus , define @xmath133 we have already dropped constant factors in the expressions for @xmath22 that will cancel out .",
    "note that these expressions only depend on the total mass by way of the limits of integrations  which are very simple , known functions of the mass  so these integrals could be done just once for a given noise curve , storing the intermediate values .",
    "when the cutoff needs to be calculated , the cumulative integral could be evaluated at the given isco and ringdown frequencies .",
    "hence , this would be a fast way of calculating the cutoff , with no need to do the integrals each time the cutoff is needed .",
    "we can test this recommended frequency by comparing it to the optimal cutoff frequency found by the amoeba search described in sec .",
    "[ sec : efficiency ] . for 3.5 pn templates in initial ligo",
    ", we find that it is an excellent match to the optimal frequency .",
    "[ fig : fcrecomendations ] shows these two values , along with dark and light bands showing the regions in which changing @xmath48 results in a loss of overlap of 1% and 3% , respectively .",
    "of course , the same figure shows that using the erd recommendation would stay within the 1% error bounds .",
    "nonetheless , the close match between this recommendation and the true optimum suggests that it is sound .",
    "thus , our final recommendation is to use the weighted - average frequency cutoff throughout the entire mass range .",
    "while our analysis has been restricted to equal - mass systems , the cutoff frequency we have defined here could be applied to unequal - mass systems as well .",
    "it will be interesting to see how this cutoff fares in those situations .",
    "similar results hold for advanced ligo , when using our recommended template for each mass .",
    "that is , in regions where 3.5 pn templates do poorly ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : threeparamoverlapsummaries ] ) , the weighted average is a poor predictor of the optimal cutoff frequency using those templates , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fcrecomendations ] .",
    "however , in those same regions  where pseudo-4.0 pn templates do",
    "well  the weighted average is a good predictor of the optimal cutoff frequency for 4.0 pn templates .",
    "thus , again , we recommend using the weighted - average frequency cutoff throughout the entire mass range with advanced ligo .    by prescribing a cutoff frequency , the search does not need to extend over that parameter .",
    "similarly , by prescribing a post - newtonian order , we need use only one template for a given total mass . on the other hand , if these recommendations decrease the overlap found by too much when using them compared to the overlap found by an unconstrained search , it may be better to search the larger parameter space .",
    "we can evaluate the loss in overlap by comparing the results found using our recommendations to the results found when searching over the set of all three template families , and all masses , mass ratios , and cutoff frequencies .",
    "we have determined that this loss in overlap when using our recommendations is always less than 0.0025 for initial ligo , and less than 0.007 for advanced ligo .",
    "we have compared high - accuracy nr waveforms for equal - mass binary black holes from the caltech  cornell group to stationary phase post - newtonian waveforms .",
    "we examined a number of factors that influence the matches between the two , with the goal of optimizing the matches and hence improving the efficiency of templated searches in initial and advanced ligo .",
    "we first considered the effect of the post - newtonian order to which the phase evolution is taken , and found that adding terms up to 3.5 pn or pseudo-4.0 pn to the currently - used 2.0 pn templates significantly improves the matches over a large range of masses , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : threeparamoverlapsummaries ] .",
    "we then studied the effect of varying the upper cutoff frequency of the templates .",
    "the frequency that achieves the optimal match is a function of mass , and we find this function is well - approximated by an average between isco and erd , weighted by contribution to the snr , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcrecomendations ] . finally , we allow the symmetric mass ratio @xmath1 to range over unphysical values up to @xmath134 , and find that this dramatically improves matches , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : physicaleta ] . based on the results we recommend adjusting the searches using",
    "_ taylorf2 _ template waveforms by going up to 3.5 pn or 4.0 pn over most of the mass range , integrating up to our recommended cutoff , and allowing allowing @xmath1 to extend up to 1 . for initial ligo , the overlaps obtained using these parameters is always within 0.0025 of overlaps achievable by optimizing over all three parameters .    in future work",
    "we plan to extend this analysis to unequal - mass and spinning black - hole systems .",
