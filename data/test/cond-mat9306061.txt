    "the interface between the a- and b - phase of he  is the only known boundary between two superfluid systems .",
    "the interface motion that accompanies the first order phase transition from the undercooled a- into the b - phase is subject to extended experimental and theoretical investigation .    within the hydrodynamic regime , the structure of the interface dynamics",
    "can be rigorously determined by connecting the hydrodynamic modes on both sides of the interface with the appropriate connecting conditions ( cocos ) .",
    "this has already been done @xcite for the planar interface . in the present work ,",
    "we generalize the hydrodynamic description to interfaces of finite curvature , taking as an example spherical b - phase bubbles growing in a bath of undercooled a - phase .    to gain a qualitative understanding ,",
    "consider first planar growth .",
    "for small growth velocities , the released latent heat serves as the source for two second sound step functions , emitted in opposite directions @xcite .",
    "the steps move with @xmath0 and @xmath1 if the a - phase is located on the right and @xmath2 denotes the second sound velocity . if the interface velocity @xmath3 becomes larger than @xmath2 , both steps are left behind in the b - phase .",
    "the same is true for spin waves if an external magnetic field produces excess magnetization at the interface @xcite .",
    "the reference velocity is now of course the spin wave velocity @xmath4 , rather than @xmath2 .",
    "qualitatively , bubble growth is not much different , except that the surface tension delivers an extra push towards the energetically more favorable b - phase : neglecting the anisotropy , radial step functions of second sound are emitted out- and inward for @xmath5 .",
    "the inward moving step functions quickly equalize the temperature distribution within the b - phase bubble .",
    "for @xmath6 , both radial waves of second sound remain inside the bubble while the temperature remains homogeneous in the a - phase . the spin wave and the magnetization",
    "behave accordingly .",
    "( though spin waves are emitted only for higher interface velocities @xmath7 @xcite ) the case @xmath8 may seem academic but one really can not discount the possibility that it was indeed already observed @xcite .",
    "then , even both spin waves remain inside the bubble where neither the temperature nor the magnetization is homogeneous .",
    "causality sees to it that the a - phase is completely unperturbed .",
    "the complication of bubble growth is in its time dependence .",
    "while planar growth keeps both @xmath3 and the amplitudes of the emitted waves constant , neither are in bubble growth .",
    "the growth velocity is not constant because the pushing surface tension , proportional to the inverse of the bubble radius @xmath9 , is not .",
    "the amplitudes are not constant , because first of all , they vary as @xmath10 when moving away from the interface ; second , the amplitudes in addition are functions of @xmath11 .",
    "( in fact , there is a retardation effect , the amplitudes are functions of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the time of flight @xmath14 or @xmath15 . )",
    "the anisotropy of @xmath2 and @xmath4 will distort the radial wave into an elliptical shape , with the principal axes being parallel and perpendicular to @xmath16 , the orbital preferred direction .",
    "( we presume @xmath16 to be uniform . ) in addition , the growth and kapitza coefficients are also @xmath16-dependent , and this directly distorts the bubble .",
    "( given enough time , of course , the surface tension will drive the bubble into the shape that minimizes the surface energy ; generally , it is somewhere inbetween , reflecting some stationary balance between the surface tension and the uneven growth . )",
    "assuming the same eccentricity for both ellipses , we can rescale to obtain isotropic growth and radial waves to perform the calculations . afterwards",
    ", the distortion into elliptical waves is achieved by taking the correct value of the anisotropic velocity for the two principle axes .",
    "if there are many bubbles present , their growth can be considered completely independent for @xmath17 , because the magnetic signals barely feed back to the growth @xcite , while the second sound waves , which do feed back , are confined to the interior of the bubbles . for @xmath18",
    "however , the many emitted second sound waves heat up the surrounding a - phase .",
    "since the latent heat is not completely evacuated , the growth velocity slows down accordingly .",
    "a b - phase bubble is thermodynamically stable only if its radius exceeds the critical value @xmath19 ) @xcite , where @xmath20 denotes the interface tension and @xmath21 is the difference in the chemical potential across the interface ( for every quantity @xmath22 , we define : @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "since @xmath25 vanishes at the coexistence point , @xmath26 diverges if @xmath27 approaches @xmath28 . at lower temperatures , , where @xmath29 is the mean free path of the quasi particles , the hydrodynamic description becomes valid only after the bubble has nucleated and reached an appropriate size by ballistic processes .",
    "1 shows the respective length scales as a function of temperature . as pointed out by leggett and yip @xcite",
    "the nucleation process itself is likely to be of exotic nature .",
    "the cocos @xcite , we shall employ fall into three categories , those for the conserved quantities , those for the symmetry variables and the parameterization of the surface entropy production . for the locally conserved quantities , the cocos state the continuity of the respective currents , expressing the fact that conserved quantities can not accumulate within , or be depleted from , a region of microscopic width .",
    "this is not true , however , if the momentum current traverses a curved interface , where the radial bulk momentum current differs by the interfacial momentum current @xcite @xmath30 .",
    "( note that @xmath31 : in equilibrium the pressure is larger on the a - phase side . ) with prime denoting the rest frame of the interface , the cocos are : @xmath32 the notations : mass current @xmath33 , pressure @xmath34 , nonlinear part of the momentum current @xmath35 , energy current @xmath36 and spin current @xmath37 .",
    "the behavior of the symmetry variables in the interface region is related to the elasticity of the order parameter within the interface .",
    "since the elastic coefficients are of comparable order of magnitude in the interface as in the bulk liquid , we have coherence of the symmetry variables across the interface . more specifically , we have for the phase angle @xmath38 and the rotation angle @xmath39 in spin space @xmath40 it is by means of eq .",
    "( [ rbphi ] ) that the interface tension acts in accelerating the growth process .",
    "since ( [ rbphi ] ) implies @xmath41 , the interface tension couples to the dynamics through the pressure dependency of the chemical potential and coco ( [ rbmomentum ] ) is implicitly incorporated .",
    "when the growth starts at @xmath42 we find the initial interface velocity to be twice as fast as in the planar case .",
    "this effect should be accessible to experimental probe .",
    "the irreversibility of the phase transition is accounted for by the growth coefficient @xmath43 for @xmath6 , and by the kapitza resistance @xmath44 for @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are effective , integrated quantities and functions of various surface onsager coefficients , thermodynamic susceptibilities and bulk transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "the rate of interface entropy production @xmath45 is then respectively given as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the entropy current .",
    "so except eq .",
    "( [ rbmomentum ] ) , all cocos retain their form of planar growth .    the solution of these cocos in sec .",
    "[ sec : dyn ] shows the following result : the growth velocity decreases with @xmath48 towards the limiting value @xmath49 ( of the planar growth ) ; while the amplitudes of second sound generated during the growth show some intricate time dependency .    in sec .",

    "these are more accessible to experimental probe .",
    "the general case of @xmath50 interacting bubbles @xmath51 is discussed in sec.[sec : nbub ] .",
    "we consider the magnetic signals emitted during bubble growth for @xmath52 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the magnetization is for @xmath53 essentially given by its equilibrium values @xmath54 . the small deviations from the equilibrium values do not change much , going from planar to bubble growth . for higher velocities , @xmath55 , the dipole - interaction is negligible , the magnetic signals turn into spin waves and become delocalized . here , the circumstances of bubble growth are more complicated and are what we shall consider .      the feed - back of the spin - dynamics to the growth velocity @xmath56 is negligible if @xmath56 is not too close to @xmath57 @xcite .",

    "[ app : xvtau ] .",
    "we shall work with the longitudinal model @xcite , which contains only two dynamical variables : the magnetization and the dipole angle @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 is that between @xmath65 and @xmath16 , and @xmath66 is the angle around @xmath67 ) .",
    "the initial scenario contains a b - phase bubble of radius @xmath68 , exposed to a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath69 . within the bubble , we assume a uniform @xmath67-texture , parallel to @xmath69 ; in the surrounding a - phase we have @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",

    "[ sebwgl ] shows that the outgoing wave fronts will be of ellipsoidal shape with a rotational symmetry around @xmath16 . assuming a growing bubble with the same eccentricity , as discussed in the introduction",
    ", we may distort the coordinates to render both ellipsoids ( interface and wave front ) spherical : @xmath75 ( @xmath76 is the spin - superfluid velocity . )    the b - phase spindynamics need not be considered explicitly . after the initial time lag of @xmath77 ,",
    "the imploding wave front meets at the center .",
    "there , the excess magnetization ( always parallel to the external field @xmath69 ) from opposite directions add up , while the spin superfluid velocities @xmath78 ( all having the same sign along the radial direction ) from opposite directions cancel .",
    "so homogeneous magnetization and vanishing @xmath78 is a good approximation .",
    "with @xmath79 , we can safely neglect terms of order @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; the cocos ( [ rbtet ] ) and ( [ rbspin ] ) therefore take the simplified form @xmath82 with gyromagnetic ratio @xmath83 and susceptibility @xmath84 .",
    "working with the longitudinal model , only one of the three relations ( [ rbtet ] ) is needed here .",
    "the procedure to determine the space and time dependency of the radial waves from their cocos is given below :    in the first step , we calculate the values of the general solution @xmath85 at the interface ( subscript @xmath86 ) from the cocos ( [ sebbc1 ] , [ sebbc2 ] ) .    substituting the time dependent bubble radius @xmath9 for @xmath87 , we find @xmath88 where @xmath47 denotes the derivative of @xmath89 with respect to its argument .",

    "figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "the spatial variation of the outgoing radial wave is illustrated for different times .",
    "each curve displays two effects .",
    "first the @xmath10-decrease as the wave moves out , and second the amplitude at @xmath101 is a function of @xmath56 at @xmath102 , a retardation effect .",
    "the line at the upper surface of the box marks the location of the bubble surface , relative to the starting value .",
    "below , one can track the decrease of the amplitudes at the interface . as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : dyn ] , these plots also visualize the second sound amplitudes , emitted by a slowly growing bubble .    at the head of the shock wave ,",
    "i.e. where @xmath103 , the expressions for the amplitudes simplify to become @xmath104    the qualitative effect of the spin diffusion , neglected here , is the rounding of the magnetization step with @xmath105 at the wave front .",
    "so eq .  ( [ sebhead ] ) is valid for the total change in @xmath76 and @xmath99 .",
    "the interface dynamics of superfluid he  is fundamentally different from other systems @xcite .",
    "if @xmath5 , the evacuation of latent heat is very efficiently accomplished via second sound , the difference between hypercooling and normal supercooling is inessential , and @xmath3 is determined by the kapitza resistance of the interface . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the system is always hypercooled , no heat evacuation needs to take place and not much does .",
    "@xmath3 is determined by the growth coefficient .    in bubble growth , two similar scenarios prevail : for weak undercooling of the a - phase , @xmath106 ,",
    "an outgoing radial wave is emitted into the a - phase , while an imploding wave is emitted into the bubble .",
    "the latter will interfere at the center of the bubble , as in the case of spin waves , yielding vanishing counterflow and an averaged temperature , depending only on the current bubble radius .    for strong undercooling , assuring @xmath107 at all time ,",
    "no sound is emitted into the a - phase , while an exploding and an imploding wave superpose inside the bubble , yielding a time dependent temperature distribution .",
    "we start from the linearized equations of bulk hydrodynamics ( correct for both limits @xcite @xmath108 , @xmath106 but not in - between , @xmath109 @xcite ) , in a form appropriate for the spherical symmetry of the problem . as in planar growth ,",
    "first sound is too fast to need explicit consideration .",
    "its only role is to maintain uniform pressure on both sides of the interface , while keeping the discontinuity @xmath110 across it .",
    "this leaves two equations : conservation of entropy and the equation for the counterflow .",
    "the counterflow , @xmath111 is curl - free and can be written as @xmath112 .",
    "the two hydrodynamic equations then become @xmath113 eq .  ( [ sphersymvar ] ) seems to allow @xmath114 and @xmath115 differing by an explicit function of time .",
    "this is ruled out by the wave equation that can be obtained from the combination of ( [ spherentro ] ) and ( [ sphersymvar ] ) , which must not have any time dependent source .    in summary",
    ", we end up with @xmath116 in close analogy to ( [ sebdyn ] ) .",
    "we will consider two different stages : the first stage is characterized by the existence of an incoming and an outgoing second sound wave and lasts only for a time span of order @xmath117 , where @xmath118 .",
    "the second stage starts after the interference has established homogeneity inside the bubble , making the temperature solely dependent of the bubble radius . in the calculation of the second stage we shall neglect the existence of the first .",
    "this only changes the initial condition and hence the exact shape of the radial wave front but not its magnitude .",
    "for very weak undercooling , @xmath26 is large compared to the quasiparticles mean free path , so that for @xmath119 @xmath42 and @xmath120 are the valid initial conditions .",
    "otherwise , we assume a nonvanishing initial temperature discontinuity @xmath121 and @xmath122 at @xmath119 .",

    "the situation is quite similar to that of spinwaves , examined in the last section .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , we expect the growth velocity of the bubble to slow down , when its surrounding heats up from second sound radiation sent out by other bubbles .",
    "only the case of weak undercooling ( @xmath160 ) is worth studying , since for strong undercooling ( @xmath161 ) all the latent heat remains inside the bubble .",

    "increasingly hinders the evacuation of latent heat and slows down the growth velocity .",
    "we will restrict our calculations to the regime where the temperatures of both the a- and b - phase can be regarded as being uniform .",
    "the volume @xmath51 is thus divided up into two subsystems : @xmath50 bubbles of total volume @xmath162 and the remaining a - phase of volume @xmath163 . since the gradients vanish , the local hydrodynamic description of the previous sections reduce to thermodynamic considerations : for small deviations from equilibrium , energy conservation accounts for equality of the entropy currents , @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath166 denote the total entropies of the respective phase . because of the identity @xmath167",
