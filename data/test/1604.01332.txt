    "the structure , properties and reactions of nuclei and nuclear matter depend on the dynamics of the nucleons  @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why the derivation of the nuclear forces is probably the most important problem of nuclear physics .",
    "after the discovery of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  the fundamental theory of strong interactions  a solid theoretical understanding of the nuclear force should be grounded on qcd , either directly or indirectly .",
    "lattice qcd represents the direct , computational derivation : the interaction of quarks and gluons is not analytically solvable at the distances that are characteristic for nuclear physics but it is numerically solvable at the expense of huge computational resources .",
    "recent progress in this front is exciting  @xcite .",
    "the indirect derivation requires to explain the nuclear interaction without explicitly solving qcd . yet",
    "qcd must enter indirectly in the picture .",
    "otherwise we will end up with a phenomenological description instead of a theoretical explanation .",
    "physics as a science depends to a great extent on the existence of scale separation in nature .",
    "one can describe the properties of atoms without explicit knowledge of the composite nature and internal structure of the nuclei within .",
    "the nucleus is indeed much smaller than the atom containing it , i.e. there is an excellent separation of scales .",
    "analogously , one can describe the dynamics of nucleons and pions without knowing the details of the strong interaction of the quarks and gluons inside them .",
    "however the average distance of nucleons in a nucleus  about @xmath0  is not that different from the size of the nucleon or the wavelength of the quarks and gluons inside , maybe @xmath1 . without a clear separation of scales the development of satisfactory theoretical explanations to physical phenomena",
    "becomes more difficult . as a consequence",
    "the description of nuclei is less clear and more involved than that of atoms .",
    "effective field theories ( efts ) are the standard theoretical tool to exploit the separation of scales of a physical system with the intention of building the most general description of it at low energies  @xcite .",
    "if we call the low energy scale @xmath2 and the high energy scale @xmath3 , an eft provides a power expansion in terms of @xmath4 of all the physical quantities of a system . for",
    "that one considers first all the possible interaction terms in the lagrangian that are compatible with the low energy symmetries of the system .",
    "then one orders the infinite feynman diagrams obtained in the previous step according to their expected size .",
    "the method by which we estimate the size of the diagrams is called power counting . while writing the diagrams is trivial , their power counting is not .",
    "the connection of the eft to the fundamental theory at the scale @xmath3 is provided by renormalization , the core idea of eft . in its standard formulation renormalization deals with ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences in the feynman diagrams of the eft . to remove the divergences one includes an uv cut - off and allows the couplings in the lagrangian to depend on the cut - off .",
    "if the calculation of the observable quantities of the eft is independent of the cut - off then the eft is renormalizable .",
    "power counting is decided according to how we have to arrange calculations to remove the divergences at each order in the expansion .",
    "wilsonian renormalization  @xcite provides an alternative but equivalent formulation . here",
    "the starting point is the independence of observables with respect to the cut - off . in this case",
    "it is the calculation of the couplings under the assumption of cut - off independence that leads to the size of these couplings at low energies and to their power counting  @xcite .",
    "this is referred to as renormalization group : the focus is on the evolution of the couplings as the cut - off changes , not on the divergences . in wilsonian",
    "renormalization the cut - off runs from the high to the low energy scale , from @xmath3 to @xmath2 .",
    "this is counterintuitive from the standard point of view , where the cut - off runs from @xmath2 to @xmath3 with the purpose of finding out whether there are uv divergences .",
    "yet they are equivalent .",
    "the cut - off can either run to the ultraviolet or the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "as far as the observables are independent of the cut - off we end up with identical power countings .",
    "the starting point in wilsonian renormalization can be either an eft or the fundamental theory .",
    "the advantage in the first case is that power counting can be determined without a complete order - by - order calculation of observables . in the second case",
    "there is the possibility of evolving a fundamental theory from @xmath3 to @xmath2 , which amounts to uncovering the eft by means of a concrete calculation .",
    "of course this is only possible in the few cases where the fundamental theory is known or easily solvable ( a nice example can be found in ref .  ) .",
    "this manuscript is dedicated to wilsonian renormalization in nuclear eft  @xcite : even though it is less well - known than the standard idea of removing divergences , it can provide a clearer interpretation of power counting and the role of the cut - off in eft .    in nuclear physics",
    "the eft usually contains nucleon and pion fields   that are constrained by chiral symmetry , a low energy symmetry of qcd that is exact in the limit of massless @xmath5 , @xmath6 and sometimes @xmath7 quarks .",
    "the problem is that historically renormalization has been only well understood in the case of systems that are perturbative  @xcite .",
    "this is the case in hadron physics for processes involving at most one baryon , where chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite , the standard eft for low energy hadronic processes , is used .",
    "but in nuclear physics the existence of the deuteron and the virtual state ( the @xmath8 singlet ) , not to mention the few thousand known nuclei , indicates that the nuclear force is non - perturbative .",
    "besides there is the additional problem that eft entails nuclear forces that are strongly divergent at short distances .",
    "thus it is not a surprise that progress in nuclear eft has been full of unexpected turns and controversies .",
    "recently we have begun to have a solid grasp of the non - perturbative renormalization of the eft potentials  @xcite and how to organize the power counting in this situation  @xcite , but even these advances have been the subject of debate  @xcite .",
    "here we will review power counting from the perspective of the renormalization group .",
    "historically events have unfolded in a zig - zag pattern .",
    "weinberg made the first proposal for a nuclear eft  @xcite , which includes the iteration of the eft potential ( at least at lowest order ) .",
    "this serves to capture the non - perturbative character of nuclear interactions but in exchange requires non - perturbative renormalization .",
    "as previously said , this has been the source of a few surprises .",
    "kaplan , savage and wise ( ksw ) discovered a subtle but nonetheless serious inconsistency with the weinberg proposal  @xcite .",
    "these authors also developed a new formulation of nuclear eft , the ksw counting  @xcite , which is free from that inconsistency .",
    "however the convergence of the ksw counting in the triplet partial waves happened to be unsatisfying to say the least  @xcite .",
    "the community turned back to the weinberg proposal in search for phenomenological success  @xcite .",
    "but later nogga , timmermans and van kolck  @xcite discovered that the weinberg proposal contains a new , more conspicuous inconsistency at the lowest order : it is not renormalizable in some p- and d - waves  .",
    "new developments about renormalizability followed  @xcite that made finally possible a consistent nuclear eft with good convergence properties  @xcite . despite these advancements ,",
    "there is an ongoing debate about whether these problems are relevant and whether it would be simply more sensible to reinterpret renormalizability for non - perturbative problems in a different way  @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss these new developments , except for a brief comment .",
    "here we are mostly concerned about the derivation of eft power counting from a specific set of renormalization tools , which happen to be more than enough to make nuclear eft work at the theoretical level . from this perspective the previous ideas , though interesting , do not appear to be totally necessary .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we introduce wilsonian renormalization for the particular case of non - relativistic scattering of two particles .",
    "part of it is general and part of it is specific to nuclear physics .",
    "we also discuss the relationship of power counting with the anomalous dimension of couplings and the relationship between wilsonian renormalization and the more standard approach of removing ultraviolet divergences . in sect .",
    "iii we extend the results beyond the two - nucleon system , in particular to the deuteron electroweak reactions and to the three - body problem .",
    "finally we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we also include an appendix discussing the derivation of a particular equation in this manuscript .",
    "here we illustrate how wilsonian renormalization works for non - relativistic s - wave scattering  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is a `` fundamental theory '' . for a non - relativistic two - body system",
    "the equivalent of a fundamental theory is the non - relativistic potential @xmath9 . to obtain the scattering amplitudes",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation at finite momentum @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the reduced wave function , @xmath13 the reduced mass , @xmath10 the center of mass momentum and @xmath14 the underlying potential , which we assume to be known at all distances . as we are considering s - wave scattering",
    "there is no centrifugal term .",
    "we solve this equation with the regular boundary condition at the origin @xmath15 finally the phase shift can be extracted from the asymptotic wave function @xmath16    wilsonian renormalization works as follows . in a first step",
    "we include a cut - off @xmath17 as a separation scale @xmath18 we will consider that the physics at distances shorter than the cut - off @xmath19 is unknown .",
    "of course if we cut the potential for @xmath19 the physical observables will change .",
    "we want to prevent this from happening . in a second step",
    "we include a new piece in the potential that counteracts the loss of information from having a cut - off and keeps the observables unchanged .",
    "this extra piece is the contact - range potential , which can take many parametrizations . for simplicity",
    "we choose the following form for the contacts @xmath20 that is , an energy - dependent delta shell potential .",
    "now we solve the schrdinger equation with the `` renormalized '' potential @xmath21 for distances below @xmath17 we have a free schrdinger equation @xmath22 with the regular solution @xmath23 for distances above @xmath17 we have the original schrdinger equation , i.e. eq .  ( [ eq : schro - fundamental ] ) .",
    "finally at @xmath24 the delta - shell potential @xmath25 generates a discontinuity in the first derivative of the wave function that takes the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 refers to @xmath28 , with @xmath29",
    ". a derivation can be found in [ app : delta ] .",
    "this is the renormalization group equation ( rge ) for the contact - range coupling @xmath30 .",
    "the rge we have written above is exact : the starting point is the full potential @xmath9 and we want to check what type of contact interaction we have to include to account for the existence of a cut - off radius @xmath17 . for @xmath31",
    "we have the boundary condition @xmath32 : we know the potential at all distances and there is no need for the contact - range couplings .",
    "as we increase the cut - off radius , we will need non - vanishing @xmath33 couplings to account for the missing physics .",
    "the reason we are interested in wilsonian renormalization is because we want to know how physics looks like at large distances in general .",
    "we want to describe phenomena at low energies regardless of which is the fundamental theory at high energies . with wilsonian renormalization",
    "we can build a theory for distances larger than the cut - off ( @xmath34 ) that is equivalent to the fundamental theory for momenta @xmath35 . in this context",
    "it is useful to define the soft and hard scales @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the soft scale @xmath2 is the characteristic momentum of the low energy physics we want to describe , while the hard scale @xmath3 is the natural momentum scale of the fundamental theory . if we solve the rge for @xmath36 we will be able to derive the kind of generic low energy theory we are interested in .    to solve the rge and obtain the contact range couplings we simply have to make an ansatz for the wave function @xmath12 .",
    "the simplest case is provided by a theory in which the underlying potential has a finite range set by the hard scale @xmath3 @xmath37 with this is mind we see that the wave functions for @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the phase shift of the fundamental potential @xmath9 .",
    "therefore the solution of the rge for @xmath41 is @xmath42 for finding the running of the individual @xmath33 couplings we expand the rge in powers of @xmath43 .",
    "we first take into account that @xmath9 is a finite - range potential and the effective range expansion applies ( for @xmath44 ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the scattering length , @xmath47 the effective range and @xmath48 the shape coefficients .",
    "now we expand and get the set of equations @xmath49 plus analogous equations for the higher order couplings . in the equations above @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "are polynomials of the cut - off @xmath17 and the effective range coefficients .",
    "they are easy to calculate but they are not included here because their exact form is inconsequential for the analysis that follows .",
    "the previous equations are generic solutions for an arbitrary finite range potential @xmath9 .",
    "however the counting of the couplings @xmath33 as @xmath52 depends on which is the size of the effective range coefficients and in particular the scattering length . in general the size of the effective range coefficients",
    "is known to scale according to the range of the potential ( therefore the name ) : @xmath53 the exception is the scattering length @xmath46 that can take any value , more so if there is non - perturbative physics .",
    "thus we distinguish two possibilities : @xmath54 the first one is a scattering length of natural size and the second an unnaturally large scattering length , which is what happens for instance if there is a bound state near the threshold .",
    "if the scattering length is of order @xmath55 we are entitled to expand in powers of @xmath56 because @xmath41 .",

    "the function of @xmath64 is to absorb the cut - off dependence that the @xmath65 coupling generates at finite energy .",
    "the @xmath64 piece of @xmath60 is inessential for power counting .",
    "for @xmath66 we have @xmath67 + c_4^r(r_c ; a_0 , r_0 ) \\",
    ", , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which scales as @xmath68 and where @xmath69 is analogous to @xmath64 , only that it absorbs the residual cut - off dependence of @xmath65 and @xmath60 . for the higher order couplings we have @xmath70 .",
    "the other possibility is that the scattering length is large : @xmath71 .",
    "now the cut - off and the scattering length can have the same size and we are not allowed to expand in powers of @xmath56 . if we solve the rge for @xmath65 we obtain @xmath72 which means @xmath73 , an enhancement of one power of @xmath74 . for the @xmath62 coupling",
    "we get @xmath75 which entails @xmath76 , an enhancement of two powers of @xmath74 . for the @xmath77 coupling",
    "we find @xmath78 and in general for the @xmath30 we have @xmath79 which implies a @xmath80 enhancement over the natural case .",
    "the first implementation of this type of rg analysis of the couplings in nuclear eft is due to birse , mcgovern and richardson  @xcite , who formulated the rges in momentum space . instead of imposing the invariance of the phase shifts with respect to the regulator",
    ", their analysis requires the invariance of the full off - shell t - matrix . for contact - range interactions both conditions",
    "are equivalent : on - shell renormalization implies off - shell renormalization .",
    "probably this is the case too for finite - range potentials ( it has been proved for potentials that have power - law divergences near the origin  @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the rges in momentum space is pretty convoluted though .",
    "the analysis of the coordinate space rges of ref .   is simpler as it only depends on the schrdinger equation and its solutions .",
    "it connects the rges with the cut - off dependence of the observables after an arbitrary number of contact - range operators are included .",
    "but at the same time it neglects how the rges relate to the power counting of the couplings .",
    "the purpose of this section has been to close this gap and to translate the rg analysis of ref .   from momentum to coordinate space , attempting to make its interpretation clearer in the way .",
    "the question we wanted to answer is : what kind of low energy theory does one derive from the rges ?",
    "the answer involves two ingredients .",
    "the first is a non - relativistic potential for the low energy theory , the effective potential : @xmath81 that is , the contact - range potential that compensates the cut - off dependence .",
    "the fundamental potential @xmath9 does not enter into the effective potential for the simple reason that it vanishes at large distances ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the second ingredient is the size of the couplings , that we have already calculated from the rges . as a consequence of the scaling properties of the couplings we can write the effective potential as a power series in @xmath4 .",
    "let us consider the example of a theory with a natural scattering length , for which we have @xmath82 if we take into account the typical factors of @xmath83 and the reduced mass that are common in non - relativistic scattering , the previous scaling allows to rewrite the @xmath30 couplings as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a number of @xmath86 .",

    "thus the power counting does not change if the long range potential is perturbative .    in nuclear physics",

    "notice that we have written the ope potential as @xmath148 where @xmath149 is a polynomial that contains a @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath147 term , where all the terms have three powers of @xmath152 .",
    "the analogy with the contact - range potential is clear , more so if we write @xmath25 as @xmath153 where we can appreciate that the @xmath154 factor in @xmath155 plays the same role as the @xmath65 coupling in @xmath156 .",

    "the bottom line is that non - perturbative ope goes along with the assumption that @xmath139 is a light scale .",
    "the idea that non - perturbative ope requires the existence of an additional light scale ( besides the obvious choices such as the external momenta , the pion mass or the inverse of the scattering length ) was probably _ explicitly _ realized in ref .",

    "triplet is a coupled channel and the ope is a matrix : the tensor operator contains an attractive and repulsive eigenvalue , and the attractive one happens to have a bigger impact on power counting . ] .",

    "the most obvious one is the canonical dimension @xmath6 , which can be related to the rescaling @xmath271 that is , the canonical dimension refers to how @xmath270 changes with a change of physical units .",
    "another type of dimension we can define is the power counting dimension , which refers to a rescaling of @xmath2 ( and @xmath272 only @xmath273 it is important to notice that while the canonical dimension of a physical quantity is unique , the power counting dimension is not .",
    "rather a physical quantity is a superposition of contributions with different power counting dimensions @xmath274 the inclusion of @xmath188 among the things we rescale for the power counting dimension seems counter - intuitive at first , but it is natural once we consider the argument about the rg evolution of cut - off dependent quantities from @xmath196 to @xmath275 .",

    "it is important to mention that nowadays  after the discovery of efts  renormalizability is understood in a broader sense . yet for efts the application of this principle is simple : we begin by considering the matrix element of an eft operator between eft wave functions @xmath279 the operator contains a finite- and a contact - range piece . for the moment we will ignore the contact - range piece because we want to use these operators to remove divergences in the finite - range piece .",

    "other important point is the relationship between rga and more standard techniques of determining the power counting . by more standard techniques we refer to ultraviolet renormalization and residual cut - off dependence . in principle",
    "we expect all derivations to be equivalent . in practice",
    "this equivalence has to be shown by means of concrete calculations .",
    "the results indicate the direct equivalence with rge in the absence of singular pion exchanges , i.e. in the absence of the tensor force .",
    "if the tensor force is present there is an apparent contradiction though : the @xmath30 couplings seem to be more demoted in ultraviolet renormalization than in rga or in residual cut - off dependence .",
    "this disagreement can be explained as a contamination of the @xmath30 couplings with the @xmath139 scale . in other words , what we call @xmath30 in ultraviolet renormalization",
    "is not really the @xmath30 coupling , but rather a coupling with the structure @xmath333 instead of the expected @xmath334 .",
    "this distinction is in fact analogous to the one that is usually made between @xmath65 and @xmath335 .",
    "there are a few open problems that we have not addressed though .",
    "the most obvious example is the power counting of the triplet channels where the ope potential is a repulsive @xmath147 .",
    "the rg evolution of the couplings indicates that , with the exception of @xmath65 , the scaling of the couplings is identical to that of the attractive @xmath147 potential .",
    "this conclusion agrees with a previous rga of the ope potential  @xcite , but it is counterintuitive to say the least . if the long - range physics is repulsive we expect that the short - range physics will play a lesser role at low energies because the repulsive long - range physics acts as a potential barrier .",
    "that is why some authors prefer to use naive dimensional analysis in this case  @xcite .",
    "other problem that is related to the previous one is what happens with coupled channels such as the @xmath267 deuteron channel . in this latter case",
    "three different countings have been proposed  @xcite .    even in the attractive triplet channels",
    "there are two proposals about the scaling of the @xmath65 coupling : does it enter at @xmath236 ( @xmath336 ) or at @xmath337 ( @xmath338 ) ?",
    "the rga of birse  @xcite assumes that @xmath65 is @xmath337 in the attractive triplet channels .",
    "but here we have taken the view that @xmath65 is @xmath236 : it has to be there because the @xmath236 wave function of a non - perturbative attractive triplet is not well defined without the inclusion of short - range physics .",
    "we find it worth noticing that the perturbation @xmath256 of this coupling is @xmath337(@xmath338 ) , which is where @xmath65 is predicted to be by birse s rga  @xcite .",
    "that is , the cause of the disagreement seems to be that ref .",
    "overlooks the presence of short - range physics in the @xmath236 wave functions : the @xmath65 coupling is implicit in the choice of a semiclassical phase , i.e. the choice of @xmath170 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uk_lo ] ) .",
    "one last problem is the scaling of the @xmath30 couplings in the @xmath8 singlet .",
    "the standard counting  @xcite is that the piece of @xmath30 that carries physical information enters at @xmath339 : @xmath60 at @xmath327 , @xmath77 at @xmath340 , @xmath329 at @xmath341 , etc .",
    "long and yang  @xcite get to a different conclusion instead : the @xmath30 s enter at @xmath342 : @xmath60 at @xmath327 , @xmath77 at @xmath343 , @xmath329 at @xmath340 , etc .",
    "the conclusion is a bit puzzling : according to ref .",
    ", dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction leads to a stronger enhancement of the @xmath30 couplings than cut - off regularization    other aspect to discuss is the interpretation of the cut - off in eft .",
    "the rg equations use a cut - off in the region @xmath192 .",
    "this raises the question of whether the cut - off should stay below the breakdown scale , as happens in the rga .",
    "the answer is _ not necessarily_. the rg equations are formulated with the limits @xmath344 and @xmath345 in mind to uncover the scaling of the couplings this is a formal requirement to make the analysis easier , not a practical requirement in eft calculations .",
    "efts are rg - invariant : the cut - off does not appear in the observable quantities that we compute , only in the intermediate calculations leading to the eft predictions .",
    "that is , the cut - off is kept low in rga with the intention of making the scaling of the contact - range couplings as obvious as possible .",
    "once the rga is done the only constraints about the size of the cut - off are practical ones .",
    "one of these constraints is the existence of residual cut - off independence . in most eft calculations",
    "we do not include all the couplings that are required to achieve exact rg independence .",
    "we only include the couplings that carry physical information at the order we are considering .",
    "there are two reasons for doing this : first , exact rg independence is not well - defined if we are making calculations in an eft at a given order .",
    "the systematic eft error is always present and rg independence must be understood within this error .",
    "the second reason is that exact rg independence requires the inclusion of what we have called here the redundant couplings , i.e. the @xmath346 piece of the couplings in the rg equations .",
    "these redundant operators can be calculated and included explicitly in a few specific cases : the ksw counting  @xcite and pionless eft with pds  @xcite .",
    "but on more general cases this is unpractical and not really necessary .",
    "it is easier to keep the residual cut - off dependence under control by a judicious choice of the cut - off . for this condition to be true",
    "it is usually enough for @xmath188 to be of the order of the hard scale , though the exact details will depend on the regulator .",
    "other important thing is to stress that a power counting is merely an ideal organization of the size of the interactions of a theory .",
    "they are derived under the assumption that the scale separation is large and that we can clearly classify all scales either as soft ( @xmath2 ) or hard ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "however the real physical world is not necessarily like that .",
    "what do we do if we have a two - body system with a scattering length that is neither small nor large ?",
    "the point is that what we obtain with rga is just an approximation to a more complex reality . in particular",
    "other power countings are possible beyond the ones we have discussed here .",
    "for instance in ref .",
    "van kolck developed a counting for two - body systems in which the scattering length is tiny .",
    "other possibility is when both the scattering length and the effective range are large , a case which can be useful for the description of low lying s - wave resonances or even for the @xmath8 singlet to improve the convergence  @xcite .",
    "that means that we are entitled to curb the counting rules in view of practical physical information of the system .",
    "the limit is theoretical consistency : the eft must be equivalent to the fundamental theory at low energies , which means that renormalizability must be respected .",
    "the principles of renormalization work in the same way for operators different than the two - body potential .",
    "the advantage of calculating the anomalous dimension is that we can extend the idea seamlessly to any other problem .",
    "the point is to have a coupling and a polynomial contact - range operator , to evaluate their matrix element and to demand rg invariance at the end , @xmath347 actually the whole process amounts to nothing more than following a recipe .",
    "the only thing we have to do is to choose the wave functions and the operators that are appropriate for the particular physical process we are studying .",
    "let us consider the case of a reaction involving a external probe and the deuteron ( or more generally the two - nucleon system ) .",
    "in this case the contact - range operators of the theory involve two nucleons and one ( or more ) external fields .",
    "the external fields we are interested in are pions , photons and neutrinos . in principle",
    "the initial and final wave functions are the product of a two - nucleon wave function and the wave function of zero , one or more external probes @xmath348 where @xmath349 refers to the probes , with the index @xmath350 .",
    "the contact - range operator involves a coupling and a polynomial of the momenta of the nucleons and the external probes . in the plane wave basis",
    "it reads @xmath351 where @xmath352 ( @xmath353 ) is the center - of - mass momentum of the initial ( final ) two - nucleon system and @xmath354(@xmath355 ) the momenta of all the incoming ( outgoing ) probes involved in the operator . in general",
    "the polynomial @xmath356 will involve spin and isospin degrees of freedom , but for the moment we will ignore them .",
    "how does one evaluate the matrix elements ? if we consider that the wave functions of the external probes are plane waves , the evaluation of the contact - range operator yields latexmath:[\\ ] ] with @xmath478 a small positive number .",
    "the evaluation of the following pieces is direct @xmath479 while the two remaining pieces vanish in the @xmath29 limit @xmath480 the reason being that the integrand is bounded in the region around @xmath17 .",
    "we can see that while @xmath12 is continuous at @xmath24 , @xmath481 develops a discontinuity .",
    "putting the pieces together for @xmath29 we arrive at @xmath482 finally , expanding @xmath483 in powers of @xmath43 we obtain eq .",

    "<S> effective field theories are the most general tool for the description of low energy phenomena . they are universal and systematic : they can be formulated for any low energy systems we can think of and offer a clear guide on how to calculate predictions with reliable error estimates , a feature that is called power counting . these properties can be easily understood in wilsonian renormalization , in which effective field theories are the low energy renormalization group evolution of a more fundamental perhaps unknown or unsolvable high energy theory . in nuclear physics </S>",
    "<S> they provide the possibility of a theoretically sound derivation of nuclear forces without having to solve quantum chromodynamics explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> however there is the problem of how to organize calculations within nuclear effective field theory : the traditional knowledge about power counting is perturbative but nuclear physics is not . yet </S>",
    "<S> power counting can be derived in wilsonian renormalization and there is already a fairly good understanding of how to apply these ideas to non - perturbative phenomena and in particular to nuclear physics . here </S>",
