    "until recently the direct observation of non - adiabatic dissipation of energy into electronic excitations during adsorption events has been limited to highly energetic processes , such as the oxidation of alkali and alkali - earth metals @xcite .",
    "such reactions can result in chemiluminescence or the ejection of exo - electrons .",
    "investigation of low - energy electronic excitations has been restricted by the difficulties involved in making experimental measurements .",
    "however , two recent series of experiments have provided the first direct observations of the excitation of relatively low - energy electrons and holes .",
    "white , wodtke and co - workers @xcite observed exo - electron excitation when a low - workfunction , caesium - doped gold surface was exposed to a beam of vibrationally excited no molecules .",
    "they suggested that during the vibration of the no molecules the ground electronic state oscillates between the neutral and negative ion and rapid transfer of an electron between the surface and the molecule during this oscillation leads to the excitation of the electronic system @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in the chemicurrent experiments performed by nienhaus and coworkers @xcite .",
    "these experiments involve the fabrication of schottky diodes , consisting of a thin , @xmath0100  , metal film deposited onto a doped silicon wafer with electrical contacts made to the film and the back of the wafer . on exposure to beams of atomic hydrogen , hot electrons or holes with sufficient energy to traverse the metal film and",
    "cross the schottky barrier at the metal - semiconductor interface were measured as a chemically - induced - reverse - current or ` chemicurrent ' .",
    "these devices have been used to investigate differences in the adsorption of hydrogen isotopes @xcite as well as a range of other adsorbates @xcite .",
    "similar devices have also been used to study other surface phenomena @xcite including adsorption and desorption in h / au @xcite and chemiluminescence in o / mg @xcite .",
    "theoretical modelling of the electronic excitations generated during the adsorption of hydrogen atoms on metal surfaces has been performed recently using three techniques : electronic friction based methods @xcite , the time - dependent , mean - field newns - anderson model @xcite and time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite .",
    "electronic friction methods use a nearly - adiabatic approximation in which the time - dependent perturbation of the electronic system is assumed to be weak and slow .",
    "this leads to a description of energy transfer equivalent to that induced by a simple frictional force .",
    "the electronic friction coefficient can be calculated through ab - initio methods@xcite , and has been widely used in the study of surface dynamics , including the damping of vibrations in adsorbed molecules@xcite and desorption dynamics @xcite .",
    "the energy distribution of excited electron - hole pairs can be obtained by coupling this friction description to the forced oscillator model @xcite .    however , electronic friction calculations exhibit problematic features when considering strongly non - adiabatic behaviour . trail and coworkers",
    "@xcite found that ab - initio calculations of the friction coefficient for an h - atom above a copper ( 111 ) surface yield a singularity at an altitude of 2.4  above the atop site .",
    "this unphysical feature was linked to the change in the ground state from being spin - polarised ( h - atom far from the surface ) to unpolarised ( h - atom close to the surface ) . to avoid this problem a somewhat arbitrary choice was made to constrain the spin of the dft calculations to be constant , giving a non - singular variation for the friction coefficient .",
    "calculations using these constrained results yielded probabilities for electrons being excited over a schottky barrier which were in line with the experimental results of nienhaus and coworkers .",
    "the use of a spin - constrained calculation is not , however , a satisfactory solution to the problem , and other methods have been sought which can describe systems which experience a spin - transition .",
    "the time - dependent , mean - field newns - anderson model @xcite , used in our previous work @xcite , provides a straightforward way to study the spin - transition in a fully non - adiabatic fashion .",
    "this model describes the interaction of a single adsorbate orbital , containing a pair of coupled energy levels , with a broad band of metal states .",
    "time - dependence is included through the movement of the adsorbate energy levels relative to the fermi level and the variation of the adsorbate - metal interaction . within the mean - field and wide - band approximations expressions describing the time - evolution of the adsorbate energy level occupations , the non - adiabatic transfer of energy to the surface @xcite , and the spectrum of electronic excitations",
    "have been derived @xcite .",
    "tddft calculations take the set of kohn - sham wavefunctions for a given system , generated from a conventional static dft calculation , and evolve them through the time - dependent schrdinger equation , using ehrenfest dynamics for the nuclear motion .",
    "this technique has been used by lindenblatt and pehlke @xcite to investigate the interaction of hydrogen atoms with an aluminium surface , yielding results for the non - adiabatic energy transfer and the spectrum of electronic excitations . however ,",
    "computational constraints restrict the application of this technique to consideration of light elements only , and the restricted basis set leads to somewhat noisy results .",
    "a recent comparison of tddft and newns - anderson results for the h / al system @xcite has shown good agreement in these two descriptions of non - adiabatic behaviour .    in our previous publications",
    "we have introduced and demonstrated the properties of the time - dependent , mean - field newns - anderson model @xcite using simple parameter variations to explore the non - adiabatic evolution of the adsorbate - metal system . here",
    ", we use this model to analyse systems of direct relevance to the chemicurrent experiments described above : hydrogen and deuterium atoms approaching the copper and silver surfaces .",
    "this work is presented in two steps . in section [ sec : params ] the method used to generate appropriate parameters for the h / cu and h / ag systems is described .",
    "these parameters are then used in section [ sec : results ] to make comparisons between theoretical and experimental results for both the size of the chemicurrent and isotopic ratios on each metal surface .",
    "conclusions are drawn from these results in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "within the wide - band and mean - field approximations the newns - anderson model can be parameterised through the position of the bare adsorbate level @xmath1 , the width of the adsorbate resonance @xmath2 and the intra - adsorbate coulomb repulsion energy @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "values of these parameters , as a function of h - atom altitude , are found by fitting the adiabatic solution of the mean - field newns - anderson model to ground - state dft calculations .",
    "the time - dependence is then obtained by choosing a trajectory which links altitude to time in a realistic way .",
    "a series of dft calculations of hydrogen atoms above the copper and silver ( 111 ) surfaces have been performed using the castep @xcite code .",
    "the surfaces were modelled with a slab geometry consisting of five layers of atoms and an equivalent vacuum gap above , with lattice parameters fixed at the experimental bulk values of 3.614  and 4.085  for copper and silver respectively @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen atom was placed at a set of altitudes above an atop site of the surface .",
    "both systems were represented using a 2 @xmath4 2 in - plane supercell , and ultra - soft pseudopotentials were used for both the metal and the hydrogen atoms .",
    "the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional was used , and a fermi surface smearing of 0.25 ev was applied .",
    "sampling of the surface brillouin zone was performed using 54 k - points , and plane - wave cutoffs of 290 ev and 300 ev were used for the copper and silver surfaces respectively .    a total of 88 calculations were performed for the two systems with h - atom altitudes varied between 1 and 3.5  .",

    "have been extracted and are plotted in figs [ fig : params](a)-(d ) . while these results could be used directly to obtain a variation for the bare energy level @xmath1 and the value of @xmath3 , it is important to consider whether this would provide the best description of the excitation process in the h / cu and h / ag systems . in previous work",
    "@xcite we have shown that the transfer of charge between the adsorbate and surface can significantly alter the excitation spectrum .",
    "an excess of high - energy electrons is produced if there is a net electron transfer to the surface , while an excess of high - energy holes is generated if adsorption is accompanied by electron transfer to the adsorbate .",
    "it is therefore important that the occupations of the adsorbate level are correctly represented in order to obtain reliable results .",
    "we have therefore devised a procedure which gives parameterisations of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , and the value of @xmath3 , which are consistent with a desired variation of the adsorbate level occupation .",
    "the target occupations are calculated by integrating the dft generated h - atom pdos up to the fermi level , and are shown in figs [ fig : params](e ) and ( f ) .",
    "error functions are then used to fit the variation of the resonance width and bare energy level with altitude , with the constraint that the adsorbate occupations are consistent with those obtained from the dft pdos . the procedure for obtaining these parameters is described in detail in ref .",

    "we have chosen to use a constant total energy trajectory with an initial kinetic energy at 4  of 25 mev , where the h - atom is accelerated in the potential energy curves shown in fig [ fig : pes ] .",
    "as we are particularly interested in the effects of the spin - transition , calculations are terminated when the adsorbate reaches the back of the surface potential well , i.e when the adsorbate reaches 1.1  or 1.25  for the copper and silver surfaces respectively .",
    "isotope effects ( explored experimentally by krix , nienhaus and co - workers @xcite ) can be investigated by changing the adsorbate mass in the trajectory calculations .",
    "in this section we use the parameters derived above and the computational model described previously @xcite to investigate the non - adiabatic behaviour of the h / cu and h / ag systems .",
    "in addition to @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath3 , the computation of the adsorbate occupations , energy transfer rates and excitation spectra requires a set of energy grids for the evaluation of integrals . here , a 128,001 point energy grid covering the range @xmath1290 to 10 ev relative to the fermi level has been used with numerical methods equivalent to those discussed previously @xcite .",
    "a system temperature of 175 k is used in all calculations .",
    "[ fig : n_e ] shows the time - evolving charge and energy transfer behaviour for hydrogen and deuterium atoms approaching the copper and silver ( 111 ) surfaces . as the adsorbates approach the metal surfaces the adiabatic occupations for the majority and minority spins converge on one another resulting in a sharp spin transition at 2.3 - 2.4  .",

    "[ fig : n_e ] .",
    "each system shows a sharp peak in this energy transfer rate at the spin transition with a small secondary peak ( most prominent for the silver surface ) just below 2  .",
    "this secondary peak is driven by the variation of the bare adsorbate level @xmath1 , ( see figs . [",
    "fig : params](c ) and ( d ) ) , while the large increase in @xmath2 is responsible for most of the non - adiabatic behaviour close to the spin - transition .    by integrating over each trajectory",
    "the energy dissipated into electron - hole pairs during the approach to the surface can be obtained .",
    "we find that h ( d ) atoms approaching the copper surface deposit 115 mev ( 88 mev ) , and those approaching the silver surface deposit 105 mev ( 80 mev ) .",
    "it is important to note that these energy transfers are expectation values and as such are an average over many trajectories .",
    "it is therefore possible for an electron hole - pair to have more energy than this average energy transfer , but with a limited probability .    the spectrum of electronic excitations generated by the approach of the adsorbing hydrogen atom is plotted in fig .

    "krix , nnthel and nienhaus have recently performed a detailed study of ag / p - si(111 ) devices which have a well characterised schottky barrier height of 0.46 ev @xcite . on exposure to beams of hydrogen and deuterium atoms chemicurrents in the range 1 - 10@xmath32 and 1-@xmath33 holes per atom",
    "were measured respectively .",
    "these data also compare well to our model  we estimate chemicurrent yields of @xmath34 ( @xmath30 ) holes per incident hydrogen ( deuterium ) atom .",
    "there is , however , some uncertainty in experimental measurements of the absolute chemicurrent yield due to difficulties in quantifying the flux of atoms reaching the device surface .",
    "one quantity which is insensitive to this uncertainty is the ratio of the chemicurrents generated by beams of hydrogen and deuterium atoms .",

    "the newns - anderson model provides a simple but effective method for analysing non - adiabatic processes in adsorption at surfaces .",
    "it allows for the calculation of strongly non - adiabatic effects , such as those occuring at a spin transition .",
    "its simplicity means that , for any set of parameter variations , the calculation of charge and energy transfer rates and the spectrum of electronic excitations is quick and straightforward .",
    "the key result of this paper is that a single passage of the hydrogen atom adsorbate through the spin transition yields a significant energy transfer into electronic excitations , and sufficient numbers of high energy excitations to account for the chemicurrent measured in thin - film schottky devices .",
    "this leaves open the question of the effect on the chemicurrent yield of the remainder of trajectory , as the atom undergoes damped vibrations in the surface potential well .",
    "it is possible to run the newns - anderson model for such a trajectory , with the damping rate being derived either from the energy loss in the newns - anderson model itself , or using an ab - initio friction coefficient as in @xcite .",
    "however , a problem arises because , at least for the first few oscillations , the hydrogen atom passes through the spin transition both when moving towards and moving away from the surface .",
    "the latter case is where the difficulty emerges .",
    "if we consider the first rebound of the atom within the potential well , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : n_e ] that the atom has de - polarised by the time it reaches the back wall and we find that the spin polarisation is zero ( to numerical accuracy ) by the time the atom passes back through the altitude where the spin transition occurs . at this point ,",
    "the atom can re - polarise , but within our numerical model there is nothing to determine in which direction the majority spin will be .",
    "the re - polarisation occurs in an unpredictable and irreproducible way , because it is driven by numerical instability .",
    "we do not believe that this can be regarded as representing a physical reality .",
    "an alternative treatment is to keep the atom non - polarised for the remainder of the trajectory after the first approach to the surface , and to analyse non - adiabaticity by comparing the time - dependent solution with a non - polarised adiabatic state ( a metastable , non - polarised adiabatic solution exists even when the ground state is spin polarised ) .",
    "we have performed such calculations , and the results show that the full trajectory gives an excitation spectrum whose magnitude is a factor of about two or three times that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "however , the justification for using this treatment is not clear ; for example , if the atom could escape from the surface the method can not be right because the final state of the atom should be spin polarised . the correct way to handle re - polarisation of the atom as it leaves",
    "the surface remains an open question , and one that is as relevant to ab - initio approaches like tddft as it is to model calculations like the ones presented here .",
