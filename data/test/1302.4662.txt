    "the kondo lattice model ( klm ) describes localized magnetic moments that interact with a single band of itinerant electrons via an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling @xmath1 .",
    "this model has been introduced long ago by doniach ,  @xcite and , since then , has been widely invoked to describe the physics of heavy - fermion materials .",
    "@xcite three ingredients define the klm : the bandwidth @xmath2 of the conduction electrons ( usually denoted by @xmath3 electrons ) , their density @xmath4 , and the kondo exchange @xmath1 that controls the coupling between the local moments and the spin density of @xmath3-electrons .",
    "the localized moments ( denoted by @xmath5 electrons ) are anchored to the sites of a regular lattice .",
    "the phase diagram of the klm depends in a non - trivial way on @xmath6 and the electron density @xmath4 .",
    "in one spatial dimension , the klm has been intensively studied and shows three distinct phases .",
    "@xcite in the compensated case , one conduction electron per localized spin , i.e. , @xmath7 , it is a so - called kondo insulator with a charge as well as a spin gap without any magnetic order , a kind of spin - liquid insulator . for @xmath8 ,",
    "it is either a paramagnetic metal for low @xmath6 , or a ferromagnetic metal for larger @xmath6 . in higher dimensions , where the @xmath9 spin symmetry can be spontaneously broken",
    ", the phase diagram is expected to enrich and display a critical point separating a paramagnetic heavy - fermion metal from a different metallic phase with long - range magnetic order .",
    "@xcite indeed , in analogy with the kondo effect that occurs in the case of a single magnetic impurity , the conduction electrons may screen the localized moments , thus forming a global singlet state .",
    "however , such a kondo screening is thwarted by the tendency to magnetic ordering of the localized moments .",
    "in fact , the latter ones interact mutually via the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) mechanism , through an effective exchange @xmath10 mediated by the magnetic polarization @xmath11 of the conduction band .",
    "the competition between kondo screening ( that favors a paramagnetic ground state ) and rkky interaction ( that favors magnetically ordered states ) is the heart of a frustrating behavior , which may lead to genuine quantum phase transitions.@xcite furthermore , other physical processes may profit from the balanced competition between kondo screening and magnetic ordering nearby the transition , and make novel phases to intrude , most notably superconductivity .",
    "indeed , the discovery of superconductivity in cecu@xmath12si@xmath12 ,  @xcite and subsequently in several other heavy - fermion materials , unveiled the rich variety of phenomena of these strongly - correlated systems .",
    "it is widely believed that , in heavy - fermion compounds , superconductivity is not the conventional phonon - mediated one , but most likely it is caused by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "@xcite    recent experiments of the hall coefficient in the heavy - fermion material ybrh@xmath12si@xmath12 ,  @xcite have provided new intriguing elements that renewed interest in the phase diagram of the klm .",
    "in particular , the rapid jump of the hall coefficient  @xcite is suggestive of a sudden change of the fermi surface topology at , or close to , the quantum phase transition between the non - magnetic metal and the magnetic one . in the conventional view of heavy - fermions , the localized spins are promoted in the conduction band through the kondo effect . a mass - enhanced fermi liquid is thus settled down , with a `` large '' fermi surface that includes the conduction as well as the localized electrons . in the simplest scenario of a spin - density - wave quantum phase transition ,  @xcite magnetic ordering",
    "is indeed expected to modify the topology of the fermi surface by appearance of the magnetic bragg reflections .",
    "in addition , the fermi surface reconstruction across the magnetic field induced transition in ybrh@xmath12si@xmath12 can also be simply interpreted as a zeeman driven lifshitz transition of the heavy quasiparticles .",
    "@xcite however , an alternative scenario is possible in which the kondo effect dies out at the transition point ,  @xcite hence the local moments suddenly stop contributing to the volume of the fermi surface , which then counts only the number of @xmath3 electrons . in the language of the anderson lattice model , which maps for strong repulsion onto the klm , the death of the kondo effect would translate into the mott localization of the @xmath5 electrons , whose magnetic ordering would then be only a by - product rather then the driving source . indeed , there are suggestions that the kondo - breakdown and the onset of magnetic order in the anderson lattice model are distinct phenomena , which may occur at different points of the phase diagram .",
    "@xcite this scenario has been indirectly supported by variational monte carlo calculations  @xcite and by the gutzwiller approximation  @xcite in the klm on a square lattice . indeed , these works found evidence of two distinct phase transitions , one given by the continuous appearance of long - range magnetic order and another one related to an abrupt topological change of the fermi surface .",
    "the same outcome of two distinct transitions has been later observed also within the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) .",
    "@xcite in spite of all efforts , such an interesting issue like remains open .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate the klm in two dimensions paying attention not only to magnetism , but also to the possible emergence of superconductivity in its proximity .",
    "we use both mean - field and variational monte carlo approaches . as far as the former one is concerned , an analytical treatment of the long - range antiferromagnetic phase is possible only at compensation , @xmath7 , where calculations have been already performed .",
    "@xcite here , we go beyond the results of ref .   and consider also the uncompensated regime , @xmath13 , by solving numerically the hartree - fock equations .",
    "furthermore , we generalize the previous calculations based upon the variational monte carlo approach  @xcite or the gutzwiller approximation  @xcite and introduce additional correlations inside the trial wave function , among which superconducting ones .",
    "in particular , our variational calculations show that superconductivity is indeed stabilized in the paramagnetic sector in a region of the phase diagram close to @xmath7 and not too large @xmath6",
    ". however , when magnetism is allowed in the variational wave function , an antiferromagnetic phase emerges and completely covers the superconducting dome .",
    "therefore , at least within the variational approach and in our model where the only source of magnetic frustration is deviation from the compensated regime , we do not find any superconducting region at the border between antiferromagnetic and heavy - fermion metal .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section  [ sec : model ] , we introduce the microscopic model and discuss the methods that we use ; in section  [ sec : results ] , we present our numerical results for both mean - field and variational approximations ; and , finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] , we draw our conclusions .",

    "we start our analysis by considering the paramagnetic sector , which is reacher than the one obtained within mean - field approximation , and can shed some light by disentangling kondo effect from long - range magnetism . the paramagnetic phase diagram of the klm , allowing for superconductivity , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasepm ] .",
    "we find that , although ( on - site or extended ) @xmath52-wave pairing is never stabilized , a sizable @xmath0-wave pairing is obtained in a wide range of parameters , namely for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and brings a non - negligible energy gain with respect to a normal phase .",

    "[ fig : phasevmc ] agrees pretty well with that obtained by watanabe and ogata ,  @xcite who also use a variational wave function similar to ours , though with less variational freedom since it allows only @xmath30 hybridization and antiferromagnetism .",
    "indeed , we find that all additional variational parameters , e.g. , @xmath50 hopping and superconductivity , do not change appreciably the energy , hence the phase diagram . moreover , the variational phase diagram bears similarity also to that one obtained by martin , bercx , and assaad  @xcite by the dynamical cluster approximation , although in the latter case all transitions seem continuous .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied , by mean - field and variational monte carlo techniques , the kondo lattice model on a square lattice .",
    "the mean - field phase diagram is qualitatively but not quantitatively similar to the variational monte carlo one . restricting the analysis to the paramagnetic sector , we have found by variational monte carlo a large region of @xmath0-wave superconductivity , which however disappears from the phase digram once we allow for antiferromagnetism .",
    "it is well possible that , if magnetic frustration is added besides that due to @xmath13 , superconductivity could emerge and intrude between the antiferromagnetic phase and the paramagnetic one , thus offering a possible explanation to what is observed in many heavy fermion compounds .",
    "the variational monte carlo phase diagram is practically the same as that obtained by watanabe and ogata  @xcite by a similar technique .",
    "in particular we also find that the onset of antiferromagnetism and the breakdown of kondo effect are not simultaneous close to compensation , @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , we find that the kondo collapse always occurs via a first order phase transition and is accompanied by a redistribution of low - temperature spectral weight at the chemical potential inside the brillouin zone .",

    "<S> we study the phase diagram of the kondo - lattice model with nearest - neighbor hopping in the square lattice by means of the variational monte carlo technique . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we analyze a wide class of variational wave functions that allow magnetic and superconducting order parameters , so to assess the possibility that superconductivity might emerge close to the magnetic instability , as often observed in heavy fermion systems . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we do find evidence of @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the paramagnetic sector , i.e. , when magnetic order is not allowed in the variational wave function . </S>",
    "<S> however , when magnetism is allowed , it completely covers the superconducting region , which thus disappears from the phase diagram . </S>"
