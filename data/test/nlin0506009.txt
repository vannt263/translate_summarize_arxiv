    "semiclassical approaches to multidimensional tunnelling lead to very interesting problems in complexified classical dynamics , often with incompletely understood solutions .",
    "for example , recent work in references @xcite has shown that nontrivial geometrical structure such as complex homoclinic intersections have an important role to play in multidimensional barrier penetration and that even complex chaos can be relevant . given the difficulty inherent in a systematic treatment of multidimensional tunnelling as a result of such issues , it is perhaps surprising that a relatively simple description can be given of barrier penetration at a critical energy where classically allowed transmission mechanisms turn on and where primitive semiclassical approximations must be replaced by somewhat more complicated uniform ones .    an approach which achieves",
    "this has been proposed in references @xcite and @xcite and in this paper we apply the method explicitly to a model waveguide problem .",
    "the model is chosen to be rather simple so that fully quantum calculations are easy to perform accurately for purposes of comparison .",
    "we emphasise , however , that semiclassical aspects of the calculation are as easily applied to other problems , provided the topology is similar , and provide a description , for example , of collinear atom - diatom reactions . for that reason we use the terminology of chemical reactions in this paper and equate the probability of transmission with a probability of reaction .",
    "in fact the approach we describe here provides a natural means of visualising the quantum scattering problem in phase space and as such shows an interesting connection with classical transition state theories of chemical reaction .",
    "these classical theories have recently been of interest because the periodic - orbit dividing surface ( pods ) construction @xcite has been generalised to arbitrary dimensions using the construction of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds ( nhims ) @xcite .",
    "the classical constructions emerge naturally in our semiclassical approximation and we note that even though the illustrations offered here are in two degrees of freedom there are straightforward generalisations to higher dimensional problems where the full generality of the nhim construction comes into play .",
    "the approximation we use can be stated very simply as an abstract operator equation but for explicit illustration we present results in phase space , using the wigner - weyl calculus .",
    "in particular , we define a _ weyl symbol _ of a transmission matrix which represents , in an averaged sense , a reaction probability as a function of phase space .",
    "we find that above threshold the support of this weyl symbol closely mimics the shape of the classically reacting region but the weyl symbol itself also incorporates tunnelling and other quantum effects .",
    "notation and details for this construction are set out in section  [ secps ] .",
    "we implement two versions of the theory .",
    "first , a harmonic approximation derived in @xcite is applied in section  [ harmonic ] whose classical input consists simply of an instanton orbit , along with its action and monodromy matrix .",
    "this approximation works when the classically reacting region is a small neighbourhood of the initial condition for the instanton orbit and is harmonic in the sense that it uses linearised dynamics generated by an elliptic quadratic hamiltonian on the poincar section .",
    "this harmonic version covers the threshold case where classical reaction switches on as a function of energy and is relatively easy to apply .",
    "it fails however when the energy is too far above threshold and the classically reacting region is too large to be adequately described by linearised dynamics .    a semiclassical approximation that is more accurate and has greater range has been derived in @xcite and this is applied in section  [ nonlinear ] .",
    "this version uses fully nonlinear dynamics to extend further from the instanton orbit . like the harmonic version",
    "it can be stated quite simply as an abstract operator equation but its practical implementation is more difficult .",
    "difficulty arises primarily because we must invert an operator constructed semiclassically as an evolution operator and this inversion can not at present be achieved in closed form . in this paper",
    "we achieve that inversion using numerical methods and while this aspect of the approach needs further work to provide an appealing semiclassical method , we can verify unambiguously that the nonlinear version of the theory is capable of describing the quantum transmission problem very accurately ( see figure  [ figconj1 ] ) .",
    "we conclude this section by outlining how these results relate to existing work .",
    "the basic formalism here of relating scattering to complex barrier - crossing orbits goes back to the work of miller and coworkers @xcite on the classical @xmath0-matrix .",
    "our intent is to describe a simple uniform extension of this approach which applies at the boundary of classical reaction where the fate of classical orbits changes discontinuously .",
    "what allows us to make progress is that we do not directly describe the @xmath0-matrix but instead consider a transmission matrix derived from it which gives probabilities rather than amplitides .",
    "the advantage of this problem is that contributing orbits at the boundary of classical reaction depend smoothly on initial conditions , despite the singular nature of real orbits there @xcite , and give simple semiclassical expressions .",
    "this uniformisation is similar to established results relating one - dimensional transmission probabilities @xcite or the cumulative reaction probability @xcite to sums over multiple barrier crossings but includes information about how the probabilities depend on the incoming state .",
    "it is different however from uniform approximations of the scattering operator such as described in @xcite which describe explicit matrix elements .",
    "these are uniform with respect to variation of quantum numbers whereas our approach treats the scattering operator abstractly and is uniform with respect to energy and in phase space",
    ".    direct approximation of the scattering problem by complex trajectories has recently been examined in @xcite in the context of nonintegrable systems .",
    "it has been found there that , while intuitively one might expect tunnelling processes to be dominated by short complex orbits which cross the barrier directly , the dominant complex orbits can have have a surprisingly nontrivial topology in the deep tunnelling regime .",
    "it has even been found that the dominant complex orbits may be chaotic in related treatments of quantum propagation @xcite .",
    "we also find evidence of the `` fringed tunnelling '' characteristic of such mechanisms in our fully quantum solutions but the theory we outline is intended to cover only the immediate vicinity of the reacting region where direct tunnelling mechanisms are dominant . in the deep tunnelling regime our uniform results revert to standard primitive approximations and we should in principle be able to marry our approach with that of @xcite .",
    "it is not obvious , however , that a fully uniform calculation could easily be applied when the contributing complex orbits are more numerous and more complicated and we do not consider that problem explicitly here .",
    "in the following sections we will develop semiclassical approximations for representations of the scattering matrix in phase space . in this section",
    "we illustrate these representations numerically using a two - dimensional waveguide , which serves as a simplified model of a collinear atom - diatom collision .",
    "this model consists of a particle of unit mass moving in the potential @xmath1 where @xmath2 a very similar potential has been used in @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of this model will enable us easily to obtain accurate numerical solutions , which will be useful for later comparison with semiclassical approximations where exponentially small tunnelling effects are of interest .",
    "we emphasise , however , that none of the theory that follows is dependent on this simplicity and semiclassical aspects of the discussion can just as easily be applied to any other system , as long as the hamiltonian is an analytic function of its arguments .",
    "the essential structural features we assume are that the waveguide should have a single bottleneck separating asymptotically decoupled channels , which we label as reactant and product channels respectively , and that the energy should be sufficiently close to threshold that recrossings of the transition state do not occur .",
    "contours of the model potential are shown for the case @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the continuous line shows a real trajectory which is an extension of the complex periodic orbit ( or instanton ) used in the next section to construct the simplest semiclassical approximation .",
    "the dashed curve shows the trajectory defined by the decoupled dynamics of @xmath5 to which it asymptotes.,width=283 ]    for future reference , it will be useful to denote the asymptotically decoupled potential by the symbol @xmath6 we can therefore write the asymptotic scattering states for this problem analytically , as solutions of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "we write the scattering matrix in block form @xmath7 where the subscripts @xmath8 and @xmath9 refer to reactant and product channels respectively .",
    "for example , the transmission matrix @xmath10 maps asymptotically incoming states on the reactant side to asymptotically outgoing states on the product side . the theory we describe is for the matrix @xmath11 rather than for the scattering matrix itself .",
    "the matrix @xmath12 has an obvious physical role determining state - specific reaction rates .",
    "the transmission probability for an incoming state labelled @xmath13 on the reactant side can be written as a matrix element @xmath14 of @xmath12 . in going from the scattering matrix to @xmath12",
    "we lose information about phase and about the distribution of product states but , as described in @xcite , uniform semiclassical approximations for @xmath12 are expected to be considerably simpler than those for @xmath15 .",
    "formally , we can think of @xmath12 as an operator acting on the hilbert space @xmath16 of asymptotically propagating states in the incoming reactant channel  in this context we refer to it as the _ reaction operator _ in the following .",
    "we consider systems for which there are a finite number @xmath17 of such states so @xmath16 is finite - dimensional and @xmath12 can be represented by an @xmath18 matrix .",
    "the wigner - weyl correspondence offers an alternative representation as a function on phase space and the theory we outline in the coming sections is stated in those terms . in the remainder of this section we describe how the connection is made formally between the matrix representation and the representation in wigner - weyl correspondence , or the _ weyl symbol _ of @xmath12 . in preparation for that discussion , let us first describe the phase space on which these representations are defined .    as described in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the natural classical analog of the hilbert space @xmath16 is a _ poincar section _",
    "@xmath19 defined by fixing the energy @xmath20 and an asymptotically large value of the reaction coordinate @xmath21 .",
    "we use @xmath22 as canonical coordinates on @xmath19 and we may alternatively denote points in @xmath19 using the vector notation @xmath23 we define the _ allowed region _ of the @xmath24-@xmath25 plane by the condition @xmath26 and note that , as usual in this sort of correspondence , the dimension @xmath17 of @xmath16 is approximated by the liouville area of this region divided by @xmath27 .    to calculate the weyl symbol @xmath28 of @xmath12 , we denote its individual matrix elements by @xmath29 and write @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the weyl symbols of the projectors @xmath32 ( the factors of @xmath27 are to keep the notation consistent with standard practice for wigner functions in the case @xmath33 ) . for the asymptotically harmonic potential in ( [ toypot ] ) the functions @xmath31 are known analytically ( see @xcite for example ) .",

    ", we show examples of @xmath28 in figure  [ fig1 ] for the model potential in ( [ toypot ] ) with energies at and above threshold .",
    "these results have been obtained by first computing the scattering matrix numerically using symplectic integration combined with the log derivative method as described in @xcite and then using ( [ twnm ] ) . in each case",
    "we see that @xmath28 is effectively supported in a region of @xmath19 , which we can identify as the quantum - mechanically reacting region .",
    "indeed , by rewriting the reaction probability in ( [ eq : probabilityr ] ) ( using standard properties of the wigner - weyl correspondence ) in the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and interpreting the wigner function @xmath36 as a phase space pseudodensity , it is natural to identify @xmath28 as a probabability of reaction as a function of phase space , albeit in an averaged sense .",
    "although the uncertainty principle prevents us from defining a point - wise transmission probability in phase space , we can construct linear combinations of incoming states with a fixed total energy ( as in ( [ scatstate ] ) below ) whose wigner function is supported within an area of @xmath37 in @xmath19 and the appropriate modification of ( [ eq : aver ] ) then gives the reaction probability as an average of @xmath38 over that support .    for energies at or below threshold",
    ", transmission is controlled by tunnelling and @xmath28 is supported in a phase space region of area @xmath37 , centred around an initial condition that leads to an optimal tunnelling route . an explicit semiclassical expression for @xmath28 in this case",
    "will be given later and one can see for the threshold case in figure  [ fig1](a ) that @xmath28 is indeed peaked around a single point in @xmath19 . as the energy increases above threshold , a classically reacting region appears , initially centred on the orbit associated with optimal tunnelling .",
    "the boundaries of the classically reacting regions are indicated in figures  [ fig1](b ) to ( f ) by continuous closed curves ( as the energy falls to the threshold case @xmath39 , the classically reacting region shrinks to a point corresponding to the optimal tunnelling route and around which @xmath28 is concentrated ) .",
    "one can see in each case that the reacting region closely matches the support of @xmath28 .    before describing how @xmath28 is approximated semiclassically",
    ", we should outline how the classically reacting regions in figure [ fig1 ] are defined .",
    "the boundary of the classically reacting region in full phase space is the stable manifold on the reacting side of a pods in two dimensions or more generally a nhim if higher - dimensional problems are treated . extended into the incoming reactant channel , this stable manifold defines a tube , the interior of which consists of classically reacting trajectories and whose annular exterior in the classically allowed region consists of trajectories which eventually return along the outgoing reactant channel . a representation of this reacting region in a poincar section @xmath40",
    "is obtained simply by taking the a section of the tube of reacting trajectories at fixed energy and a fixed , asymptotically large value of the reaction coordinate @xmath21 . since the tube continues to evolve asymptotically ( according to the dynamics of a decoupled potential @xmath5 ) , the shape of a reacting region defined in this way will depend on the value chosen for the coordinate @xmath21 . in models where the dynamics of the reacting region is nonlinear  or potentially even chaotic in problems of higher dimension  the shape of the reacting region will not have a limit and becomes ever more complicated as @xmath21 is brought to infinity . to obtain a fixed asymptotic limit",
    "we therefore renormalise the dynamics by using the decoupled evolution of the limiting potential @xmath5 to map the asymptotic section back to one corresponding to a fixed finite value of @xmath21 . in making semiclassical comparisons the value of @xmath21 used to define this final section",
    "is dictated by the conventions used for the scattering matrix .    in the present case the asymptotic states in terms of which",
    "the scattering matrix is defined are of the form , @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the eigenfunctions of the decoupled potential @xmath5 .",
    "the phases of these scattering states are zeroed at @xmath43 and asymptotic incoming states can be constructed by starting with the transverse modes at @xmath43 and propagating them backwards into the asymptotic region of the incoming channel using dynamics defined by @xmath5 . to make a comparison with the classical picture",
    ", the renormalisation of the classical dynamics should therefore take an asymptotic poincar section back to one defined by @xmath43 .",
    "this is the convention used in figure  [ fig1 ] to compare @xmath44 with the classically reacting region .",
    "alternative phase conventions would lead to a reaction operator @xmath12 obtained by conjugation of the one we define by a unitary matrix which is diagonal in the basis @xmath13 .",
    "this conjugation makes no difference to the diagonal matrix elements @xmath45 but is important for the appearance of the weyl symbol in @xmath40 .",
    "choosing values other than @xmath43 for the reference section @xmath40 would , for example , lead to a deformation of the weyl symbol by the asymptotically decoupled dynamics .",
    "note that this renormalisation procedure is simply means of interpreting a term in the phase function in the classical @xmath0-matrix @xcite that fixes its asymptotic value . by accounting for this term using a conjugation of the asymptotic dynamics by the mapping in decoupled dynamics back to @xmath43 , we can incorporate everything about the classical @xmath0-matrix into a single poincar mapping and present results in a more compact form , as described more fully in the coming sections .",
    "in this section we describe a semiclassical approximation for @xmath12 based on dynamics linearised around an optimal tunnelling orbit .",
    "although less accurate and valid over a smaller range of energies than the fully nonlinear theory described in the next section , this harmonic approximation captures the essential qualitative behaviour of @xmath12 and works well in the especially interesting range of energies around threshold where classical reaction switches on .",
    "it is also considerably simpler to apply and can be expressed in closed form using easily obtained classical data .",

    "we also find that @xmath117 and because @xmath118 this means that the amplitude term @xmath119 in ( [ defweyl2 ] ) is real ( and positive ) .",
    "therefore @xmath107 is a positive real - valued function with a maximum at @xmath108 ( for which we have @xmath120 ) .     for an energy @xmath121 just below threshold ,",
    "a comparison is given on a logarithmic scale between the exact weyl symbol ( continuous curve ) , the nonlinear primitive approximation of equation  ( [ defweyl2 ] ) ( heavy dashed curve ) and the harmonic primitive approximation of equation  ( [ primharm ] ) ( light dashed curve ) .",
    "the parameters here are @xmath3 , @xmath86 , and @xmath122 .",
    "the nonlinear primitive result works well over a large region of phase space but does not capture the oscillations in the tail of the exact calculation , which may well be a signature of nonintegrable complex - dynamical effects of the type described in @xcite , title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] ( -100,-7)@xmath24    the harmonic approximation can be recovered by expanding the exponent to second order about @xmath108 and approximating @xmath98 by @xmath53 , giving @xcite @xmath123 \\tau_0 h(\\zetabs)/\\hbar } } { \\cosh\\beta/2}.\\ ] ] a comparison is given in figure  [ fig7 ] between this approximation , the fully nonlinear approximation of ( [ defweyl2 ] ) and exact results .",
    "although the harmonic approximation works well near the maximum of the weyl symbol , the fully nonlinear result works better over a larger range .",
    "we note however that there is qualitative deviation even from the nonlinear approximation in the deep tunnelling regime where the exact calculation shows significant oscillations not captured by the harmonic or nonlinear approximations . similar oscillatory structure , or `` fringed tunnelling '' in the scattering matrix has been explained in @xcite on the basis of nonintegrable complex dynamics and has been shown to involve mechanisms that also show up in chaotic tunnelling .",
    "it seems likely that the oscillations in figure  [ fig7 ] have a similar origin but we have not preformed a detailed analysis .",
    "it will be an interesting problem in the future to combine the inherently nonintegrable mechanism in @xcite with the uniform approximations illustrated here .",
    "although we now have an explicit closed - form semiclassical approximation for @xmath66 , no equivalent result is currently available for the uniformisation @xmath124 because inversion of the operator @xmath90 can not be done simply . in this paper",
    "we simply adopt a hybrid approach which combines semiclassical approximation of @xmath66 with numerical inversion of @xmath90 .",
    "although not a fully semiclassical method , this will allow us to verify that ( [ eq : t2 ] ) gives an accurate reproduction of quantum transmission .",
    "we first represent @xmath66 as a matrix in the same asymptotic basis @xmath13 as used for the scattering matrix .",
    "we denote individual matrix elements by @xmath125 and compute them using the wigner - weyl calculus by writing @xmath126 and approximating @xmath107 using ( [ defweyl2 ] ) .",
    "we emphasise that while @xmath66 is almost diagonal in the basis @xmath64 of eigenstates of the generating hamiltonian @xmath61 , the same is not true in the basis @xmath13 unless the potential is separable .",
    "the integral is performed numerically and the resulting @xmath18 matrix for @xmath124 , whose elements are denoted @xmath127 , is also computed numerically .",
    "this integration is not difficult since a grid on @xmath40 is easily filled by using newton integration to step the midpoint orbit , starting with the known solution corresponding to @xmath48 at @xmath108 ( for which @xmath128 ) .",
    "once the elements @xmath127 are known , the weyl symbol for @xmath124 is obtained by replacing @xmath129 with @xmath127 in ( [ twnm ] ) .",
    "the uniform nonlinear approximation is compared with the exact weyl symbol for a series of energies and the same parameters as used in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "it is difficult the distinguish the exact and approximate results at the level of graphical resolution used , but in each case the difference multiplied by @xmath130 is shown underneath as a dotted curve.,width=321 ]    we find excellent agreement between the semiclassically computed weyl symbol @xmath28 and the exact result . a nonlinear version of figure  [ fig4 ] is indistinguishable from the exact results shown in the top row of figure  [ fig1 ] and",
    "therefore not shown .",
    "instead we compare in figure  [ figconj1 ] horizontal slices of the weyl symbol through the reacting region , in the same manner as in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the potential used is the same as in figure  [ fig5 ] and the energies treated extend somewhat higher above the threshold .",
    "the exact and semiclassical results can not be distinguished at the resolution used , so the difference scaled by a factor of @xmath130 is also shown .",
    "we find similarly good agreement for other parameter sets we ahve investigated and we note that the quality of the approximation does not require special features of the classical dynamics such as symmetry , separability or adiabatic separation of transverse from reaction degrees of freedom .",
    "we should remark that the current hybrid implementation of the nonlinear calculation is cumbersome and is harder to apply further above the barrier where the larger region of integration demands that we extend the midpoint trajectory deeper into complex phase space .",
    "we have not , for example , reproduced the results on the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] using this method .",
    "the purpose of this calculation is to show that the nonlinear uniform result derived in @xcite provides an accurate description of @xmath12 in the model considered and that the method therefore deserves further exploration .",
    "even though numerical inversion was used in applying the formalism , it is built entirely on a semiclassical approximation for the tunnelling operator @xmath47 and we expect that any subsequent fully semiclassical implementation will be equally accurate .",
    "we also remark that the current hybrid method is theoretically clumsy and obscures somewhat the deeper connections between the quantum results and the underlying classical geometry .",
    "for example , it would be especially interesting to characterise the behaviour of @xmath38 at the boundary of the classically reacting region where trajectories approach the pods ( or nhim in higher dimensions ) along its stable manifold and where the classical reaction probability drops sharply from @xmath131 to @xmath132 .",
    "such an analytical approximation was found in @xcite for the harmonic version in which @xmath38 is approximated as an integral of the airy function near the boundary of classical reaction .",
    "investigation is currently underway into a method to derive similar results in the nonlinear case on the basis of generating @xmath66 as in equation ( [ tdef ] ) , but with an anharmonic generator @xmath61 computed using classical normal form theory .",
    "ultimately it should be possible to describe explicitly how the quantum reaction probability varies across the boundary of the classically reacting region in terms of trajectories which approach the complexified pods along its stable manifold and evolve along it before returning to the asymptotic poincar section .",
    "we have successfully treated quantum transmission across a multidimensional barrier using uniform semiclassical approximation .",
    "the method applies generically around a threshold energy and does not rely on specific features of the classical dynamics such as separability or the existence of action angle variables . in its fully nonlinear incarnation",
    "the method gives an accurate description of reaction probabilities in phase space and makes a striking connection between the quantum scattering problem and the geometry of classical reaction .",
    "we expect that it will work equally well in higher - dimensional problems , even in cases where the incoming states are chaotic in the transverse dynamics .",
    "although we have shown that the fully nonlinear version works well , in doing so we have resorted to numerical methods which are not in the spirit of semiclassical approximation .",
    "the theory therefore needs further development in order to achieve a fully semiclassical description of the emerging reacting region . one promising approach which is currently under investigation is to use classical normal form theory to generate dynamics around the orbit @xmath48 using a nonlinear extension of the generator @xmath56 .",
    "many of the explicit analytical approaches used in the harmonic case might then be adapted to the nonlinear approximation . in particular this",
    "is expected to produce a detailed analytical description of the weyl symbol at the boundary of the reacting region which calls on intrinsic geometrical features of ( the stable manifold of ) the nhim .    a second aspect of the calculation which deserves further attention is the treatment of rotational degrees of freedom in fully three - dimensional models of chemical reaction .",
    "although at one level this is simply a question of applying the results here individually to symmetry - reduced phase spaces for given angular momentum quantum numbers , there are interesting and nontrivial problems in describing the quantum - classical correspondence compactly in operator form .",
    "this is an especially interesting issue for reactions which proceed through a collinear mechanism since the collinear configurations are a singular part of the classical reduction process",
