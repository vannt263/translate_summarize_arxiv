    "boundary value problems ( bvps ) on infinite intervals arise in several branches of science .",
    "the classical numerical treatment of these problems consists in replacing the original problem by one defined on a finite interval , say @xmath0 $ ] where @xmath1 is a truncated boundary .",
    "the oldest and simplest approach is to replace the boundary conditions at infinity by the same conditions at the value chosen values as the truncated boundary .",
    "this approach was used , for instance , by goldstein @xcite and by howarth @xcite in 1938 to get and tabulate the numerical solution of the blasius problem . however , in order to achieve an accurate solution , a comparison of numerical results obtained for several values of the truncated boundaries is necessary as suggested by fox @xcite , or by collatz @xcite .",
    "moreover , in some cases accurate solutions can be found only by using very large values of the truncated boundary .",
    "this is , for instance , the case of the fourth branch of the von karman swirling flows , where values of @xmath2 up to @xmath3 were used by lentini and keller @xcite .    to overcome the mentioned difficulties of the classical approach described above , lentini and keller @xcite and de hoog and weiss @xcite suggested to apply asymptotic boundary conditions ( abcs ) at the",
    "; see also the theoretical work of markowich @xcite .",
    "those abcs have to be derived by a preliminary asymptotic analysis involving a jacobian matrix of the right - hand side of the governing equations evaluated at infinity .",
    "the main idea of this abcs approach is to project the solution into the manifold of bounded solutions . by this approach",
    "more accurate numerical solutions can be found than those obtained by the classical approach with the same values of the , because the imposed conditions are obtained from the asymptotic behaviour of the solution .",
    "however , we should note that for nonlinear problems highly nonlinear abcs may result .",
    "moreover , it has been noticed by j. r. ockendon that unfortunately the analysis is heavy and relies on much previous work , ",
    "see _ math .",
    "_ 84c:34201 .",
    "on the other hand , starting with the work by beyn @xcite , the abcs approach has been applied successfully to connecting orbits  problems .",
    "connecting orbits are of interest in the study of dynamical systems as well as of travelling wave solutions of partial differential equations of parabolic type . however , a truncated boundary allowing for a satisfactory accuracy of the numerical solution has to be determined by trial , and this seems to be the weakest point of the classical approach .",
    "hence , a priori definition of the truncated boundary was indicated by lentini and keller @xcite as an important area of research .",
    "a free boundary formulation for the numerical solution of bvps on infinite intervals was proposed in @xcite . in this approach",
    "the truncated boundary can be identified as an unknown free boundary that has to be determined as part of the solution . as a consequence ,",
    "the free boundary approach overcomes the need for a priori definition of the truncated boundary .",
    "this new approach has been applied to : the blasius problem @xcite , the falkner - skan equation with relevant boundary conditions @xcite , a model describing the flow of an incompressible fluid over a slender parabola of revolution @xcite , and a model describing the deflection of a semi - infinite pile embedded in soft soil @xcite .",
    "an application of the free boundary approach to a homoclinic orbit problem can be found in @xcite .",
    "moreover , a possible way to extend the free boundary formulation to problems governed by parabolic partial differential equations was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it might seem that in order to face numerically a bvp defined on an infinite interval , we have to reformulate it in a way or another .",
    "however , recently , we have found that it is also possible to apply directly to the given bvp a finite difference method defined on a quasi - uniform grid . to this end",
    "it is necessary to derive special finite difference formulae on the grid involving the given boundary conditions at infinity , but the last grid point value ( infinity ) is not required ; see @xcite for details .    in this paper , for an ocean circulation model , we report a comparison of numerical results obtained by the classical truncated boundary approach with a shooting method , those found by our free boundary approach with a finite difference method , and the ones obtained by a finite difference method with a quasi - uniform grid .",
    "a steady - state wind - driven ocean circulation model can be introduced , see ierley and ruehr @xcite , by considering the barotropic vorticity equation @xmath4 in a region defined by @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 $ ] with the following boundary conditions @xmath7 and either @xmath8 known as rigid  or no - slip boundary conditions , or @xmath9 known as slippery  or stress - free boundary conditions .",
    "equation ( [ pde - model ] ) is written in a non - dimensional form ; @xmath10 is the stream function ; to fix a reference coordinate system is fixed with the @xmath11 axis directed to the east and the @xmath12 axis directed to the north ; @xmath13 is the jacobian of the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 with respect to @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath16 is the laplacian operator on the @xmath17 plane ; the square @xmath18\\times[-1,1]$ ] models a region of the subtropical gyre formation . here",
    "the jacobian represents nonlinear advection and the laplacian the viscous drag .",
    "we assume that the curl of the wind stress in the region can be approximated by @xmath19 ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are non - dimensional parameters characterizing the widths of inertial and viscous boundary layers , respectively .",
    "we use impermeability and no - slip conditions ( [ pde - bcs2 ] ) at the coasts and impermeability and slip conditions ( [ pde - bcs3 ] ) at the fluid boundaries .",
    "we consider a particular solution to ( [ pde - model ] ) of the form @xmath22 relation ( [ eq : solution ] ) represents the first term in the expansion of a solution of ( [ pde - model ] ) with respect to @xmath12 near boundaries of the region : at @xmath23 and at @xmath24 . substituting ( [ eq : solution ] ) into ( [ pde - model ] ) , using a taylor series expansion near @xmath23 of the wind - stress term and assuming that a steady boundary - layer type solution exists , we obtain the equation for the boundary layer at the western coast , i.e. at @xmath25 , @xmath26 the parameters involved can be reduced to one if we define @xmath27 and introduce the new independent variable @xmath28    the limit of vanishing viscosity ( small values of @xmath21 ) is of particular interest .",
    "indeed , the parameter @xmath20 is also small , of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , in terms of the new independent variable @xmath30 , far from the boundaries for asymptotically matching the interior solution @xmath31 , taken of the following form @xmath32 we have to require that @xmath33    our fourth order ordinary differential equation ( [ cmodel4 ] ) can be integrated once , using zero boundary conditions at infinity for the second and third derivative of @xmath34 , to give @xmath35 + u - 1 \\ ,",

    ", we can have no - slip ( or rigid ) boundary data @xmath36 or stress - free ( or slippery ) boundary conditions @xmath37 therefore , we get the two point bvp defined on an unbounded domain that has been investigated by ierley and ruehr @xcite , mallier @xcite or sheremet et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 in ( [ cmodel ] ) can be used as a measure of the strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "in fact , for @xmath38 we get the simple linear model formulated by munk @xcite .",
    "ierley and ruehr @xcite discovered an analytical approximation for the relation between the missing initial condition and the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , for rigid conditions they proposed the relation @xmath39 and for slippery conditions they reported the relation @xmath40 the approximations provided by ( [ rigid ] ) and ( [ slippery ] ) will be used for comparison with the corresponding numerical results .",
    "in this section we present the numerical methods used in order to solve the ocean model ( [ cmodel ] ) .",
    "as a first step we rewrite the ocean equation in ( [ cmodel ] ) as a first order system @xmath41 \\label{p_qu } \\\\[-1.5ex ] & & { \\bf g } \\left ( { \\bf u}(0 ) , { \\bf u } ( \\infty ) \\right ) = { \\bf 0 } \\ ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by setting @xmath42 in this way the original bvp ( [ cmodel ] ) specializes into @xmath43 that is , @xmath44 with @xmath45 or @xmath46 in ( [ p_qu ] ) . in the following , in order to set a specific test problem , we consider the ocean model with @xmath47 .",
    "it is simple to describe a classical shooting method .",
    "we set a value for the truncated boundary @xmath48 .",
    "then , we guess a value for the missing initial condition , call it @xmath49 , and integrate the given problem as an initial value problem ( ivp ) .",
    "this defines , implicitly , a nonlinear equation @xmath50 , where @xmath49 can be considered as a parameter . in order to get the correct value of @xmath49 , it is possible to apply a root - finder method .",
    "we have found that the secant method is particularly suitable to this purpose .",
    "the same shooting method can be applied by using the newton s .",
    "this requires a more complex treatment involving a system of six differential equations . in both cases , secant or newton s root finder , we set @xmath51 .",
    "we consider first the results obtained by applying the secant method for the system of three equations ( [ eq : cmodel : system ] ) .",
    "for the problem ( [ cmodel ] ) with no - slip boundary conditions ( [ bc1 ] ) , setting @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we found the missing initial condition @xmath54 by @xmath55 iterations . in the second test , with slip boundary conditions ( [ bc2 ] ) , setting @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we obtained the missing initial condition @xmath58 with @xmath59 iterations .    on condition to provide a value for @xmath60 ,",
    "it is also possible to implement the newton s iterations .",

    "let us recall now the main properties of the box scheme proved by keller in the main theorem of @xcite .",
    "under the assumption that @xmath110 and @xmath111 are sufficiently smooth , each isolated solution of ( [ pp ] ) is approximated by a difference solution of ( [ boxs ] ) which can be computed by newton s method , provided that a sufficiently fine mesh and an accurate initial guess for the newton s method are used . as far",

    "<S> , we show that the ocean circulation model can not be considered as a simple test case . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for this method we are forced to use as initial iterate a value close to the correct missing initial condition in order to be able to get a convergent numerical solution . </S>",
    "<S> the reported numerical results allow us to point out how the finite difference method with a quasi - uniform grid is the less demanding approach and that the free boundary approach provides a more reliable formulation than the classical truncated boundary formulation .    </S>",
