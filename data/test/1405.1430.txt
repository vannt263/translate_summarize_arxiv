    "active galactic nuclei pose a fundamental problem  how does rotationally dominated gas on kpc scales lose orders of magnitude in angular momentum to fall onto an accretion disk on au scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thanks to the advent of near - infrared integral - field spectrographs ( nir ifu hereafter ) , there has been significant progress in understanding gas flows in the centers of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in recent years .",
    "the nir observations allow us to penetrate gas and dust in the active nuclei , and , in conjunction with adaptive optics , to probe very near to the nucleus .",

    "furthermore , there are intriguing hints of kinematic differences in the nuclei of local seyfert galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that the ionized gas in the disks of seyfert galaxies ( i.e. , outside of the narrow - line region or nlr ) is more kinematically disturbed than the gas in a control inactive sample . @xcite",
    "also report that seyfert galaxies have more concentrated stellar luminosity profiles , lower stellar velocity dispersions , and elevated h@xmath4  1 - 0 s(1 ) emission within @xmath5 pc relative to an inactive subsample .    in this work ,",
    "we specifically focus on megamaser disk galaxies . in these special systems , luminous water megamasers at 22 ghz trace a geometrically thin molecular disk on sub - pc scales in orbit around the central bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thanks to the keplerian rotation in the maser disk , we know the bh mass to a few percent , limited in most cases by the distance to the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "direct geometric distances have also been derived by measuring the accelerations of the systemic masers for the few best cases @xcite .",
    "in addition to distance measurements and bh masses , the megamaser disk reveals the spin axis of the accretion disk on sub - pc scales . to get the long path lengths required for masing ,",
    "the disk must be virtually edge - on ; we thus typically know the orientation of the disk on sub - pc scales to within a couple of degrees @xcite .",
    "we have already found that the spin axis of the megamaser disk aligns with the jet on @xmath2 pc scales , while the spin axis of the disk does not appear to align with flattened disk - like structures on @xmath6 pc scales identified in _ hst _  imaging @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we explore the use of nir ifu data to define the gas flows on @xmath7  pc scales , for comparison with the megamaser disk .",
    "we currently have nir ifu observations of the centers of two galaxies in the kuo et al .",
    "sample : ngc 4388 and ngc 1194 .",
    "these two are the only two megamaser disk galaxies with published bh masses where we can come close to resolving the gravitational sphere of influence , in the former case because the galaxy is nearby ( in virgo ) and in the latter because the bh is the most massive known with a maser disk @xcite .",
    "we observed ngc 4388 with sinfoni under program 386.b-0244a on the very large telescope @xcite on april 12 & may 5 2011 in natural seeing conditions and in service mode .",
    "we have been awarded time to observe this galaxy at two spatial resolutions , the higher one involving assistance of the adaptive optics system ( ao ) , however to date these observations are only partially carried out .",
    "thus , in this paper we present the lower spatial resolution data set that covers a wider field of view .",
    "our observations cover the central 8@xmath8 8 , with a spatial sampling of 0125 @xmath8 0250 .",
    "we used the @xmath9-band grating ( 1.95  2.45 @xmath10 m ) that gives a spectral resolution r@xmath113500 ( 6.2   fwhm , as measured on sky lines ) .",
    "for the observations we used standard near - ir nodding techniques . observing blocks consisted of a sequence of object and sky frames ( osoosoosoosoo ) .",
    "each individual integration was 300 sec and the sky fields were offset by 240  to the north and east .",
    "science frames were dithered by 03 in order to reject bad pixels .",
    "there were two observing blocks , with a total on - source integration time of 100 min , and 40 min in total on sky frames .",
    "additionally , after each observing block and at a similar airmass , we observed a b dwarf star to act as a telluric star .",
    "we used the eso sinfoni pipeline v2.3.3 to perform the basic data reduction on each observing block , consisting of 10 object and 4 sky exposures . in brief",
    ", the pipeline extracts the raw data , applies distortion , bad pixel and flat - field corrections and wavelength calibration , and stores the combined sky - subtracted spectra from one observing block in a 3-dimensional data cube .",
    "the final pixel size is @xmath12 .",
    "we reduced the telluric stars in the same way as the science frames . for each telluric star we extracted a one - dimensional spectrum , removed the hydrogen brackett@xmath3 absorption line at @xmath13 m after fitting it with a lorentzian profile , and divided the star spectrum by a black body spectrum with the same temperature as the star . the last step in preparing",
    "the telluric spectrum was to apply small shifts in the spectral direction ( @xmath140.05 pixels or 0.123  ) and scalings to minimize the residuals of the telluric features . to do this , we extracted a central one - dimensional spectrum from each science data cube and cross - correlated and fitted it with the corresponding telluric spectrum .",
    "we derived the wavelength - dependent correction required to match the continuum shape of the telluric star ( without an absolute zero - point ) .",
    "thus , when we divided each individual spaxel in the six galaxy data cubes by the corresponding best - fitting telluric spectrum , we also obtained a relative flux calibration .",
    "based on the seeing monitor , during our observations the seeing varied from @xmath15  for the first observation , and between @xmath16  for the second observation .",
    "note that the seeing monitor takes measurements at 5000   , thus our seeing is typically better than this . from the standard stars ( taken at the end )",
    "we measure a fwhm of 08 for the first observation and 05 for the second .",
    "we aligned the two obs with integer offsets and summed them ; all analysis was done on this final summed data cube .",
    "we observed ngc 1194 using the ifu oh - suppressing infrared imaging spectrograph ( osiris * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assisted by the laser - guide star adaptive optics system @xcite on the 10 m keck ii telescope . the data were taken over the latter two - thirds of a single night on oct .",
    "we observed in the @xmath0band with the kbb filter , for a spectral coverage of @xmath17 and a spectral resolution of @xmath18 .",
    "we used the @xmath19 spatial scale , and oriented the long axis of the ifu along the major axis of the galaxy at a pa of @xmath20 .",
    "we dithered the galaxy by @xmath21 perpendicular to the long axis of the ifu , both to facilitate bad pixel removal and to slightly increase the field - of - view to @xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , the nucleus of ngc 1194 was too faint to use as a tip - tilt star .",
    "thus , we used a nearby ( 54 ) star ( id=0888 - 0029937 ; @xmath23 ) .",
    "natural seeing conditions varied over the night from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . from our final science data",
    "cube we find that the psf core had a fwhm of @xmath26 as measured from the galaxy core .",
    "we also observed a telluric standard ( a0v ) star approximately once per unit change in airmass .",
    "finally , we interleaved sky and object observations with an object - sky - object pattern , spending 600s per sky and object exposure .",
    "we acquired a total of 170 min on source .",
    "we followed closely the reductions outlined in @xcite , using the osiris data reduction pipeline ( v2.3 ) made available by the instrument team .",
    "we repeat salient details here for completeness .",
    "the pipeline handles sky subtraction , cosmic - ray removal , glitch identification , spectral extraction into a data cube , wavelength calibration , atmospheric dispersion correction , and telluric correction using an a0v star .",
    "we experimented with a scaled sky subtraction method from @xcite , but did not find substantial improvements from the direct method .",
    "finally , we determined the centroid of each exposure by hand , applied these sub - pixel offsets , and averaged all cubes into our final data cube .",
    "here we describe our analysis procedure for the ngc 4388-sinfoni data cube in detail , highlighting any differences in analysis with the ngc 1194 data cube .",
    "we use the direct - pixel  fitting code ppxf of @xcite to fit the stellar continuum . to achieve adequate signal - to - noise ( s / n ) we use the voronoi binning scheme of @xcite , which determines contiguous bins with uniform s /",
    "n , in this case s / n@xmath27 per pixel .",
    "the sinfoni pipeline does not return an error array , and so the noise is determined empirically from line - free regions of the spectrum as the variance in the spectrum once large outliers are clipped . in the case of the osiris data , we use the per - pixel error array generated by the reduction pipeline .",
    "we then fit the coadded spectrum corresponding to each bin with a weighted combination of stellar templates .",
    "each template is shifted to the systemic velocity of the galaxy and convolved with a gaussian line - broadening function .",
    "a polynomial of fourth order is added to account for nonthermal continuum from the agn , and potentially flux calibration errors as well .",
    "example fits are shown in figure [ fig : specn4388 ] .",
    "the measurement uncertainties in both velocity and velocity dispersion are determined with monte carlo simulations . in the case of the ngc",
    "1194 data , the data reduction software generates an error array",
    ". however , for the ngc 4388 data , we use residuals from the best fit ( with the emission lines removed ) to determine the average sigma .",
    "we create 100 perturbed input spectra assuming gaussian errors in the spectra .",
    "we then refit these 100 artificial spectra .",
    "the uncertainty in each parameter is calculated as the values encompassing 68% of the trials .",
    "we experimented with a number of fitting regions , including a fit to the bandhead only ( @xmath28 , short ) , a fit to the full region ( @xmath29 , full ) , and an intermediate region ( @xmath30 , best ) .",
    "we found that the first fit delivered reliable velocity dispersions , but unstable radial velocities because of the narrow wavelength range , and because the bandhead at @xmath31 is often filled in by [ ] @xmath32 emission .",
    "fits to the full spectral region suffered from telluric residuals at @xmath33 .",
    "the just - right spectral region was therefore the third , intermediate case .",
    "the median errors on the velocities are @xmath34  km  s@xmath35  for the best , short , and full regions respectively , while the median errors on the dispersion measurements are @xmath36  km  s@xmath35 . in all cases , we masked high - ew emission lines , including the h@xmath4  lines at @xmath37 @xmath38 and also [ ] @xmath39 , @xmath40 , br@xmath41 , and [ ] .    to bracket uncertainties caused by template mismatch",
    ", we utilize two stellar template libraries in fitting the sinfoni data .",
    "one is a library of stars observed with sinfoni using the same observational set - up . in this case , no correction for instrumental resolution is required .",
    "the native sinfoni templates range from k4iii to m5iii ( plus a k4.5v star ) @xcite . as a check",
    ", we also use the stellar template library of @xcite , observed at higher spectral resolution .",
    "we use this second template set only to test our sensitivity to template mismatch .",
    "the wallace templates cover a wider range in spectral type , including km supergiants and km giants .",
    "we discuss the stellar template fits to the ngc 4388 data in detail in s 4.1 .",
    "even with different templates , we find good agreement in the two sets of stellar velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "taking @xmath42 as the answer based on the sinfoni templates and @xmath43 as the same for the wallace templates , we find @xmath44 ( where the latter number is simply the standard deviation in this ratio ) .",
    "we find that the two measurements agree within 20% ( i.e. , within the observational uncertainties ) and we find no significant systematic offset . in the case of the osiris data ,",
    "our primary fitting uses a single k5iii star , which provides an acceptable fit to our moderate s / n data .",
    "we do not a priori know the location of the black hole , or the precise photometric center of the galaxy .",
    "we could use the continuum to determine the photometric center , but then we would be sensitive to obscuration , which is still significant in the nir ( see figure [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "instead , we use the equivalent width of the co bandhead to determine where the active nucleus peaks @xcite .",
    "we use the index definition from @xcite : the index band is @xmath45 , with a continuum band centered on 2.2900 and a width of 0.0003  @xmath46 , and we also followed their prescription to correct for velocity dispersion although this correction is negligible ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these authors show that in the absence of an active nucleus , star - forming galaxies have a very uniform co ew .",
    "a declining co ew towards the galaxy center can be attributed to infill by the nonthermal continuum from the accreting black hole .",
    "we show an example in  [ sec : stellarkin4388 ] .",
    "we create an agn continuum map by taking the co ew at the edge of the cube ( ew=9.5  in ngc 4388 , consistent with stellar - population models ) and assuming that all dilution further inwards results from the agn , such that continuum ( agn ) = [ total continuum ] @xmath8 [ 1 - co ew / co outer ] .",
    "the photometric center of the continuum map falls @xmath47 south of the co ew center .",
    "the optical narrow - line region cone is only visible to the south (  [ sec : nlr ] ) , so it is sensible that the continuum centroid should be shifted towards the low - reddening side of the disk .",
    "the best - fit center also agrees within less than a pixel with the peak h@xmath4  and br@xmath3  emission , although these latter are not as well defined .",
    "we will use this position as the center of the cube throughout .",
    "in the case of ngc 1194 , the co - derived and photo - centers agree within @xmath48 .      while voronoi binning is very useful to create uniform continuum s / n ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , it is more difficult to apply to patchy emission - line maps , where by using large bins we may smear out interesting features in the line emission maps . we therefore create a second data cube using a @xmath49 pixel smoothing in the outer regions and a @xmath50 pixel binning in the inner @xmath50region . with this level of binning , we increase the s / n by a factor of two but still maintain multiple pixels across the psf .",
    "we measure the emission lines from this uniformly gridded cube . in the case of ngc 4388 , because we have such high s / n in the continuum , we again perform continuum - subtraction using ppxf before fitting the emission lines . however , there are no strong stellar absorption features beneath the emission lines of interest , and thus for ngc 1194 , where the s /",
    "n is poor in the continuum , we simply fit a local continuum value .",
    "we fit each emission line independently .",
    "we model the intrinsic line shape as a gaussian , although we allow for up to two gaussian components for emission lines with s / n@xmath51 in ngc 4388 . particularly in the br@xmath3  and",
    "[ si vi ] lines , the line shapes are often non - gaussian and warrant a second component . in @xmath52 of cases within the central @xmath53 the s / n is sufficient to warrant a two - component fit .",
    "we calculate the non - parametric fwhm from the sum of gaussian components , and from that value a corresponding line dispersion .",
    "we also experimented with an empirically determined line - broadening function by fitting a gauss - hermite model to the strong sky emission lines , which caused only very minor changes in our fits .",
    "we derive errors on all the fitted parameters by fitting 100 artificial spectra that are created as a sum of the original spectrum and a gaussian random noise array generated from the extracted errors .",
    "ngc 4388 is an sbb galaxy at a distance of 19 mpc @xcite , corresponding to a physical resolution of @xmath1 pc given our @xmath54 seeing .",
    "the galaxy magnitude is @xmath55 mag , with a b / t@xmath56 based on fits to the sdss data @xcite .",
    "we show an hst / wfc3 image combining f336w ( broad @xmath57 ) , f435w ( broad @xmath58 ) , and f814w ( broad @xmath59 ) in figure [ fig : image ] . with a photometric p.a .",
    "of 90 , the galaxy is very nearly edge - on , which is not true for the majority of the megamaser disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "the inclination determined from the large - scale kinematics is 78@xcite , and the systemic velocity from the same study is @xmath60  km  s@xmath35 .",
    "the gas kinematics show an isophotal twist on arcmin scales , that @xcite successfully model as a bar within the inner 1.5 kpc , with a p.a . of 100  on the sky .",
    "the bar is also apparent in the photometry as a boxy bulge .",
    "ngc 4388 is well - known as a galaxy that is falling into the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "gas is being stripped from the galaxy , as evidenced by an and ionized gas tail @xcite .",
    "there is even a detection of the photoionized gas in the soft x - rays @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the center of ngc 4388 , in particular because of the megamaser disk on sub - pc scales @xcite .",
    "based on the megamaser rotation curve , the bh mass is found to be @xmath61  @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "combined with the bolometric luminosity estimate from @xcite , the eddington ratio is @xmath63@xmath64 , which is in very rough agreement with our estimate from the [ ]  luminosity @xcite . like",
    "most megamaser disk galaxies @xcite , the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) in ngc 4388 is compton thick and quite bright in hard x - rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ngc 4388 has also been seen to change state in the x - ray @xcite , switching from being compton thick to compton thin .",
    "weak broad h@xmath65  has also been reported at the galaxy center @xcite .",
    "we first examine stellar rotation and dispersion .",
    "we clearly see rotation within our @xmath66 pc field of view that aligns with the disk on larger scales .",
    "following @xcite , we first use ppxf to fit the average spectrum over all data , excluding a 05 radius around the agn ( figure [ fig : specn4388 ] ) . in the fiducial fits , we do not fit higher - order gauss - hermite moments . we will examine @xmath67 and @xmath68 in  [ sec : stelrotcurve ] below .",
    "all of our default fits employ the sinfoni templates . from this high s",
    "/ n spectrum we can derive the best - fit spectral mix , which may be degenerate in lower s / n individual spectra . based on our fit to this average spectrum , we find a dispersion of @xmath69  km  s@xmath35 , which compares well with our previous measurement of @xmath70  km  s@xmath35@xcite .",
    "the best - fit template is composed of 50% k4/5iii , 38% k7iii , and 12% m5 ii / iii stars .",
    "we then fit spatially resolved spectra across the cube , using voronoi binning to ensure comparable s / n in all bins .",
    "we both allow the mix of templates to be a free parameter , and use the best - fit mixture from the high s / n fit to the entire cube .",
    "the latter fit has the advantage that by decreasing the number of free parameters , we increase the fitting stability in the agn - dominated region @xcite .",
    "however , we find excellent agreement between the two measurements , with the scatter in their fractional difference being only 9% .",
    "thus , we will present results with the stellar templates allowed to vary .",
    "the fitted rotation and dispersion fields are shown in figure [ fig : sigdispfield ] .",
    "our best - fit systemic velocity is @xmath71  km  s@xmath35 , consistent with the measurement of @xcite .",
    "we do find a systematic difference of @xmath72  km  s@xmath35  between the absolute velocity derived when we use the sinfoni stellar templates and that from the wallace et al .",
    "we are not sure of the origin of this difference ; it is possible that the sinfoni template stars , while all at rest relative to each other , have not been shifted to a rest velocity .",
    "we thus quote an uncertainty of @xmath73  km  s@xmath35  in the systemic velocity .      to derive the rotation curve we use the _ kinemetry _ formalism of @xcite , which is similar to ellipse fitting of photometry , but operates on both even and odd moments of the kinematic field .",
    "the kinematics are modeled using a sixth order expansion along ellipses with the position angle and ellipticity as free parameters .",
    "we show the resulting rotation curve in figure [ fig : stelrotcurve ] , along with the best - fit ellipse pa , ellipticity @xmath74 , and the amplitudes of the higher - order terms that encapsulate deviations from simple circular rotation .",
    "we clearly measure rotation in the stellar kinematics , with a maximum amplitude of @xmath75  km  s@xmath35 .",
    "the stellar rotation axis of 90  is aligned with the major axis of the kpc - scale disk . on larger scales ,",
    "@xcite measure a stellar rotation of 60 - 80  km  s@xmath35  out to @xmath76  ( @xmath66 pc ) , consistent with ours , which then appears to fall slightly at larger radius .    with @xmath77@xmath78",
    "km  s@xmath35  beyond 1(100 pc ) , we find a @xmath79 .",
    "overall , the stars are dispersion - dominated , but we see signs of kinematic components apart from just a bulge .",
    "firstly , for a @xmath79 , we would expect an ellipticity of @xmath80 for an isotropic oblate rotator @xcite , rather than the @xmath81 that we observe in the isophotes ( figure [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "secondly , within a radius of @xmath82 the dispersion field actually drops ( although the decrement is more pronounced on the east side of the disk ) . on the same scale",
    ", we see a jump in velocity , pa , and ellipticity likely signaling a transition from an inner disk to more bulge - dominated kinematics .",
    "thirdly , we also detect a disk - like structure in the inner 100 pc in the _",
    "hst_/wfc3 f160w image ( figure [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "the nuclear disk appears to have pa@xmath83 , misaligned with the large - scale disk , and a size very similar to the @xmath84drop region .",
    "we detect this same disk component in more detailed two - dimensional fitting of the _ hst_+ground - based data ( r. lsker et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the most likely explanation of these observations is that there is a disk within @xmath85  ( 180 pc ) embedded in the larger - scale bulge / bar . only on unextincted sight lines",
    "are the kinematics dominated by the disk component , while on heavily extincted sight lines we are seeing the kinematics in the bulge / bar .",
    "the falling rotation curve outside 400 pc may also reflect the increasing dominance of the bulge / bar on larger scales . as additional confirmation of this picture",
    ", we refit the stellar kinematics and measure the higher - order gauss - hermite moments @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although individual @xmath67 measurements have only s / n @xmath86 , we do find the classic anti - correlation between @xmath67 and @xmath87 that points to the superposition of a bulge and disk , as seen both in simulations @xcite and data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also find two additional hints that the @xmath0band extinction is higher to the west .",
    "firstly , we find a significantly redder continuum slope to the west side of the disk , corresponding to a differential @xmath88 mag assuming a @xcite reddening law .",
    "secondly , we clearly see a dip in the h@xmath4  emission on the same scale on the west side of the disk ( see  [ sec : gasflux ] ) .",
    "next we will ensure that the @xmath84drop is real and not an artifact of our fitting procedure .",
    "the agn is the primary source of uncertainty in our modeling of @xmath77  in the galaxy center .",
    "contamination from the non - thermal central source dilutes the stellar signal , and is degenerate with @xmath77  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "first , we look at the s / n of the dispersion measurements as a function of position . we find that the s / n is always @xmath89 except within @xmath21 of the agn .",
    "this first test suggests that our measurements at @xmath90  ( 100 pc ) should not be dominated by the agn .",
    "next , we re - run ppxf , but instead of fitting the continuum with the default polynomial of order 4 , we only allow a first or second - order polynomial ( figure [ fig : sigdispfield ] ) . while it is clear that , particularly in the case of the first - order polynomial , we achieve very poor fits to the nuclear region ( @xmath91 ) , we still find significant evidence for an asymmetric @xmath84drop .",
    "we then return to the wallace templates ( rather than our default sinfoni templates ) and try restricting the template set to k dwarfs .",
    "we find the same result .",
    "finally , we examine our fits with the template fixed to the mixture derived from the high s / n fit described in  [ sec : stellarkin4388 ] . in all of these cases , although the dispersion profile within 05 is not well determined , we recover the @xmath84drop on 1  ( 100 pc ) scales .",
    "we therefore conclude that the observed drop is real and that the asymmetry results from patchy reddening .",
    "although in general the north side of the disk is more heavily extincted (  [ sec : nlr ] ) , there are also dust lanes extending to the south , which are apparently preferentially affecting the west side of the 100-pc  scale disk .",
    "a falling dispersion towards the center of megamaser disk galaxies is not unexpected .",
    "these so - called `` @xmath92-drops '' are common both in spiral ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in early - type galaxies @xcite , in the latter often associated with nuclear star clusters @xcite .",
    "the typical scale is @xmath93 pc , and",
    "the most likely explanation for the falling dispersion is that the galaxy harbors a gas disk that is currently or was recently forming stars .",
    "these bright , dynamically cold stars dominate the central dispersion and cause @xmath77  to fall .",
    "in fact , ngc 2273 , one of the nearer megamaser disk galaxies , has a dramatic @xmath84drop that coincides with a known disk in the inner @xmath6 pc @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that low central dispersions are more common in active galaxies .",
    "if the @xmath84drop is caused by a young stellar disk , then we might also expect to see younger stars coinciding with the lower stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "we create a median spectrum over the region with @xmath77@xmath94  km  s@xmath35 , and rerun ppxf to investigate the mixture of stellar populations using the wallace templates , which cover a wider range of spectral type . while there is a slight preference for more supergiant light in the region of the @xmath84drop , we do not find a significant difference in best - fit spectral type as a function of region .",
    "the co ew profile is also quite symmetric and has reached its asymptotic values already in the @xmath84drop region ( figure [ fig : sigdispfield ] ) . with a larger spiral sample ,",
    "@xcite also find similar stellar population ages inside and outside of the @xmath84drop regions .",
    "we propose that the observed stellar kinematics are the superposition of three distinct components . on kpc - scales , the galaxy disk has pa@xmath95 . within our 300 pc aperture ,",
    "the kinematics are dominated by the hotter bulge / bar @xcite .",
    "based on the highest @xmath77  measurements within the cube , presumably occurring where dust obscuration is highest , we measure @xmath77@xmath96  km  s@xmath35  in the bulge / bar . then , within the inner 100 pc , we see evidence in both the kinematics and the nir isophotes for a nuclear disk component at a pa@xmath97 , misaligned by @xmath98  from the large - scale disk and with a @xmath99 .",
    "finally , on pc scales , there is a masing disk at pa@xmath100 , which is misaligned not only from the kpc - scale disk , but also by @xmath101  from the nuclear stellar disk @xcite .      with a best - fit stellar rotation field in hand ,",
    "we turn to the gas kinematics .",
    "we will examine three transitions : h@xmath4@xmath102 1 - 0s(1 ) , br@xmath3 , and the coronal line [ ] @xmath103 .",
    "we note that the [ ca viii]@xmath104 line , also coronal , has been used to trace the nlr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is blended with the co bandhead . thus we choose to focus on the [ ] line here .",
    "the two - dimensional velocity and line - ratio fields will provide information about the origins and excitation mechanisms of each transition . the fluxes that we present are the integrated flux from our one or two gaussian models as described in  3.3 .",
    "we calculate the fwhm non - parametrically from the sum of both components , and the dispersions are simply calculated as fwhm/2.35 .",
    "we also measure and present the skewness of the lines , which encapsulates the asymmetry in the two - component fits .    in figure",
    "[ fig : emissionflux ] , we show the distribution of fluxes in the h@xmath4 , br@xmath3 , and [ ] emission lines , while in figures [ fig : h2rot ] , [ fig : oiiisivi ] , and [ fig:2dgas ] , we summarize their kinematics .",
    "we see that the overall morphology of the h@xmath4follows the stellar continuum , and is even more flattened than the stellar distribution , suggesting that the emission arises from the nuclear disk .",
    "furthermore , close inspection reveals that the h@xmath4emission is asymmetric , being considerably brighter towards the east .",
    "the brighter side of the h@xmath4  disk is coincident with the observed @xmath84drop in the stellar distribution ; we can directly see the extinction of the h@xmath4  in the region where the @xmath84drop is also extincted .",
    "in contrast , the high - ionization lines are oriented at pa@xmath105 , aligned with the jet on similar scales , and also with the [ ]  emission that traces the narrow - line region ( nlr ; fig .",
    "[ fig : oiiisivi ] ) .",
    "the br@xmath3  mostly follows the high - ionization lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2dgas ] ) .",
    "their light distribution strongly suggests that their emission arises in front of the disk in projection , since the [ ] is actually brighter towards the west ( similar to the [ ] ) .",
    "based partially on these flux distributions , as well as the kinematics and line ratios presented below , we will suggest that the h@xmath4  mainly traces star formation in the nuclear disk , while br@xmath3  and [ ] trace the nlr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "we focus first on the h@xmath4@xmath106 kinematics ( figure [ fig : h2rot ] ) . as with the stellar kinematics above",
    ", we fit the h@xmath4  velocity field using kinemetry .",
    "the best - fit rotation curve , pa , and eccentricity are shown in blue in figure [ fig : stelrotcurve ] . with v/@xmath107 , the gas is considerably colder than the stars , but we are not seeing pure rotation .",
    "the rotation field shows an @xmath108-shaped kink .",
    "the twist is apparent as a discontinuity in the h@xmath4  ellipticity @xmath74 and pa in the rotation profiles at @xmath109 ( 150 pc ) , a similar radius to the changing stellar kinematics . in the skewness map , along the high - dispersion kink",
    ", we see a tendency for red asymmetry , which is plausibly attributed to the superposition of two velocity components .",
    "interior to the twist , the kinematic pa of the gas on @xmath110 pc scales appears to align with the megamaser disk .",
    "thus , it is possible that whatever mechanism causes this kink is responsible for supplying material on pc scales .    on the same scales ,",
    "we find a two - armed spiral in the dispersion map , with an inner pa @xmath105 .",
    "we find a corresponding three - arm spiral pattern in the residual map by subtracting the best - fit rotation model from the observed velocity field . to interpret these trends , we recall that any @xmath111 mode perturbation can cause @xmath112 deviations in the even velocity moments , including density and dispersion , and due to geometry @xmath113 ( and @xmath114 ) deviations in the odd velocity moments ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we propose a few mechanisms that may explain these kinematic properties .",
    "first , in the study by @xcite of the inner region of ngc 1097 , similar signatures were explained as the result of a two - arm nuclear spiral in the disk plane ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "given that the nuclear disk in ngc4388 is nearly edge - on , such a co - planar spiral density wave seems unlikely .",
    "the second possibility is that we are seeing the superposition of the kpc - scale disk and the 100 pc nuclear disk that we saw in the stellar kinematics .",
    "however , the gas pa@xmath115 , while approximately aligned with the maser disk on sub - pc scales , does not align with the stellar disk of pa@xmath97 .",
    "the final possibility is that the twist we observe here is related to the kink from the bar observed on kpc scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . only with our upcoming ao observations",
    "can we address the @xmath116 pc gas kinematics definitively , and hopefully help determine what is driving the gas inward towards the agn .",
    "the h@xmath4  shows very regular rotation along the orientation of the large - scale galaxy disk outside of the inner 1  ( 100 pc ) .",
    "additional information is encoded in the ratios of h@xmath4  to br@xmath3  ( figure [ fig : h2brg ] ) , and ratios of different h@xmath4transitions ( figure [ fig : h2rat ] ) .",
    "typically , in the hard ionizing field of the nlr , the ratio of h@xmath4  to br@xmath3  takes a value @xmath117h@xmath4/br@xmath3@xmath118 , while it is @xmath119 in star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "finally , in dense spiral arms , even higher ratios of h@xmath4/br@xmath3@xmath120 are observed .",
    "@xcite suggest that the increased h@xmath4  emission arises from the higher gas densities within spiral arms ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "ngc 4388 obeys these trends in general ( figure [ fig : h2brg ] ) . along the disk ,",
    "the h@xmath4  is strong , and the ratio has values @xmath121 , as is commonly seen in spiral arms , while in the galaxy center , the line ratio ranges from @xmath122h@xmath4/br@xmath3@xmath123 , values common for seyfert galaxies .",
    "the only surprising region lies off the disk along a @xmath124angle east of north above and below the galaxy plane , where the br@xmath3emission is strongest . here",
    ", the h@xmath4/br@xmath3  ratio is very low @xmath125 .",
    "such low ratios are reportedly associated with star - forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in this case , the br@xmath3  and [ si vi ] morphologies match both the orientation of the radio jet and the nlr traced by [ ] @xmath126 in the optical .",
    "thus , we suggest that the low h@xmath4  relative to br@xmath3  in these regions is instead due to very low densities of the nlr @xcite .",
    "we now construct spectra in characteristic regions to examine both the h@xmath4  line ratios and the line kinematics .",
    "we select regions of the map based on the h@xmath4/br@xmath3  line ratio and construct high s / n spectra from the continuum - subtracted cubes .",
    "region 1 is the center , defined as all pixels with co ew@xmath127  that lie within @xmath109 of the center .",
    "we extract two regions in the disk ( h@xmath4/br@xmath3@xmath128 ; regions 2 & 3 ) and two regions in the nlr ( h@xmath4/br@xmath3@xmath129 ; regions 4 & 5 ) . finally , we sample gas that falls beyond the main galaxy and overlaps with the [ ]  ionization cone ( region 8) , as well as two regions north of the disk , towards the northern radio lobe ( regions 6 & 7 ) .",
    "the extracted spectra for the strong transitions ( h@xmath4@xmath130 , br@xmath3 , and [ si vi ] ) from each region are shown in figure [ fig : h2brg ] , the spectra from different h@xmath4  transitions are shown in figure [ fig : h2rat ] , and measured properties from these spectra are presented in table 1 . because we fit the lines using an instrumental profile , the linewidths are naturally corrected for instrumental resolution .",
    "each line is fitted independently .",
    "in fact , as shown in figure [ fig : h2rat ] , the centroids and line shapes for the different transitions can differ , particularly for regions in the nlr ionization cone .    for each region , we can ask about the excitation mechanisms of the h@xmath4 .",
    "there are two ways to excite the warm h@xmath4 : thermal processes or fluorescence via uv radiation .",
    "the thermal processes that can in principle heat the gas include shocks , x - ray emission , or heating by uv emission .    the predicted line ratios of various h@xmath4  transitions provide diagnostics of the primary excitation mechanism .",
    "specifically , if fluorescence dominates the excitation , then the ratio of h@xmath4  2 - 1s(1 ) 2.25@xmath131/1 - 0s(1 ) 2.12@xmath131 is expected to be @xmath132 while the 1 - 0s(2 ) 2.03@xmath131/1 - 0s(0 ) 2.22@xmath131 ratio is expected to be @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "we show this pair of ratios and the expectation for pure thermal emission as the solid line , while the region dominated by fluorescence is shown schematically with the large x at the lower right in figure [ fig : h2rat ] .",
    "there is room for some uv fluorescence , but these line ratios suggest that the bulk of the excitation is thermal .",
    "similar conclusions have been drawn for larger samples of seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "our excitation diagram is constructed for the integrated line profile but , in fact the line ratio is clearly a function of velocity , particularly for the line emission arising from the nlr ionization cones .",
    "we do not have sufficient s / n to construct line ratios for the line core and line wings separately , but these different line shapes are pointing to different dominant excitation mechanisms in the line wings . higher s / n is needed to quantitatively examine velocity - dependent line ratios .",
    "we are still left with the question of which thermal process dominates the excitation .",
    "previous work has drawn various conclusions , with @xcite for instance favoring shocks in outflows , @xcite favoring a mix of processes including emission from photo - dissociation regions , @xcite favoring x - ray heating or shocks , and so on .",
    "recent papers have favored x - ray heating in the vicinity of an agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , in our case , the fact that there is little h@xmath4  coming the nlr while the bulk of the h@xmath4emission on these scales follows the morphology of the starlight ( figure [ fig : emissionflux ] ) strongly suggests that the h@xmath4  is predominantly excited by stellar processes ( e.g. , uv radiation and/or shocks from supernovas ) rather than the agn .",
    "bridging the gap between the accretion flow on @xmath14pc scales and the large - scale ionized gas outflow , we can examine the ionized gas emission on 100 pc scales .",
    "in this region , the radio emission is complex , extends predominantly north - south ( perpendicular to the disk ) and contains two unresolved peaks and a more diffuse `` bubble '' to the north @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the northern radio source is coincident with the optical nucleus , while the southern radio knot is coincident with a bright region of ionized gas seen in [ ] , strongly suggesting a jet - ism interaction .",
    "high - ionization gas is present to the south of the nucleus in our data cubes as well .",
    "previous near - infrared spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show extended h@xmath4  coincident with the galaxy disk , and high - ionization gas emission from br@xmath3  and [ ] coincident with the nucleus and ionization cone . with our high spatial resolution and three - dimensional coverage",
    ", we can robustly disentangle the disk and nlr kinematics .",
    "the br@xmath3  and [ si vi ]  emission lines show similar spatial distributions that parallel the nlr emission seen in [ ]  ( figures [ fig : emissionflux ] and [ fig : oiiisivi ] ) .",
    "their emission is distributed at an angle of pa@xmath105 , tracing the general orientation of the radio jet seen on similar scales @xcite . the ionization cone",
    "seen in [ ]  continues to the south - west beyond the sinfoni field - of - view @xcite , and is filled with radio plasma @xcite . to the north , beyond our field of view , the jet opens into another wide angle fan .",
    "it is likely that the southern ionization cone sits in front of the galaxy disk , while the northern one ( which we can see in this map and in the radio but not in the optical ) is extincted by the galaxy disk .",
    "[ tab : region ]    in figure [ fig:2dgas ] , we show the velocity and fwhm fields for br@xmath3  and [ si vi ] .",
    "both the morphology and the kinematics differ from that seen in the h@xmath4 .",
    "specifically , we do not see coherent rotation in either transition .",
    "the skewness plots are also interesting . in both transitions we see redshifted gas towards the south - west and blue - shifted gas towards the north - east .",
    "our interpretation is that we are seeing bulk motion of the gas along the jet , which apparently points towards us to the north and away from us to the south of the galaxy disk . in both cases",
    "we are probing the region of the nlr where the jet has `` broken - out '' of the galaxy disk .",
    "the higher velocity gas is moving along the walls of the bicone , as accelerated by the jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the coadded spectra from different regions reveal a similar story . in the disk regions ( regions 2 & 3 ) , where there is little emission from the nlr gas , we find strong and narrow h@xmath4 , and weak , but rather broad , br@xmath3  and [ ] . in the nlr regions ( 4 & 5 ) , br@xmath3  and [ si vi ]",
    "are stronger and slightly broader than in the disk regions .",
    "the line profiles are most complex at positions 6 , 7 , and 8 , regions that are also bright in [ ]  emission and where we see the strongest skewness in the lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oiiisivi ] & fig . [ fig:2dgas ] ) .",
    "we clearly see the red wing in the spectra from regions 6 & 8 , and the corresponding blue wing in the spectra from region 7 .     again in line with recent work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that the high - ionization lines and hydrogen recombination lines trace `` feedback '' .",
    "that is , the emission in these lines is dominated by extraplanar gas likely excited by the agn , and perhaps entrained by the nuclear jet .",
    "this nlr emission is also aligned roughly perpendicular to the megamaser disk on sub - pc scales .",
    "finally , we ask whether there is a broad component to the br@xmath3 , since @xcite detect a weak broad base to the h@xmath65  line in ngc 4388 , with a fwhm of 3900  km  s@xmath35 . within the central nuclear point source emission ,",
    "all the species have lines that are broad and symmetric ( table 1 ) .",
    "however , we find no evidence for a true broad - line component in br@xmath3 . instead , all the transitions have comparable widths .",
    "neither @xcite nor @xcite detect broad emission from br@xmath3  or br@xmath65 in their long - slit nir spectra either . perhaps the broad component detected in the optical",
    "is scattered broad emission rather than directly transmitted light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ngc 1194 is an inclined ( @xmath133 ) s0 galaxy at @xmath134 mpc .",
    "the galaxy pa is 145 , and we aligned the ifu along the major axis . given our psf of @xmath135 , we are resolving 40 pc scales with our ao - assisted observations .",
    "thus we achieve very comparable spatial resolution to the ngc 4388 observations presented above .",

    "the co bandhead is detected , but the line emission is very weak .",
    "davies et al",
    ".  do not detect br@xmath3 , but marginally detect the h@xmath4@xmath141 line .          due to the heavy binning required to achieve adequate s / n",
    ", we can not derive much spatially resolved information for this galaxy . in terms of the gas ,",
    "the br@xmath3  and [ si vi ]  flux distributions are very centrally concentrated , with a fwhm that is consistent with that of the continuum .",
    "the h@xmath4@xmath142 emission is clearly extended , but the distribution is quite patchy .",
    "we therefore construct average spectra in annuli , taking the central spectrum within the fwhm of the psf ( 016 ) .",
    "then we construct six spectra with outer radii of 05 , 1 , and 15 ( 140 , 280 , and 420 pc ) respectively , on either side of the galaxy minor axis .",
    "three examples of these spectra are shown in figure [ fig : lineregions ] .",
    "we can measure the radial velocities and stellar velocity dispersions reliably in these coadded spectra , using ppxf as above .",
    "we do find that the stars are rotating , with an amplitude of @xmath2  km  s@xmath35(figure [ fig : n1194stelsigcurve ] ) .",
    "in contrast , we do not detect a clear rotation curve in the gas .",
    "instead , the velocities are very asymmetric .",
    "asymmetric velocities in high - ionization lines are often attributed to outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are sometimes seen in h@xmath4  as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may be the explanation here .",
    "another possibility is that we are seeing spiral arms or some other non - axisymmetric gas distribution that is unrelated to the agn .",
    "our limited s / n prevents us from distinguishing between these cases .",
    "neither the [ si vi ]  nor the br@xmath3  is spatially extended enough to measure reliable velocities beyond the central region .",
    "all of the gas emission lines fluxes are weak , and the intrinsic luminosities are also low .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that this s0 galaxy is gas poor compared to ngc 4388 above , based simply on their respective morphology . on the other hand ,",
    "the center of ngc 1194 is quite dusty , so there must be some associated gas , and indeed we detect atomic hydrogen in this galaxy on large scales @xcite .",
    "the strongest gas emission comes from the high - ionization [ si vi ] line , but as mentioned above it is only marginally spatially resolved .",
    "thus , we suspect that the emission from this transition and br@xmath3  emerge from the inner nlr .",
    "in contrast , the h@xmath4  is clearly spatially resolved . in analogy with ngc 4388 above , these different gas morphologies",
    "may be suggesting that the h@xmath4  is excited by both the agn and stellar processes .",
    "we also measure the spatially resolved ratio of h@xmath4/br@xmath3 , and find that the ratio is lowest in the galaxy center ( having agn - like values ) and then rises outward , perhaps indicating an increased contribution to the h@xmath4  from stellar processes .",
    "these line ratios may suggest that the asymmetric velocities we observe in the h@xmath4  are due to non - circular motions in the inner regions of the galaxy ( e.g. , spiral arms ) rather than outflow .",
    "we have analyzed integral - field @xmath0band observations of two megamaser disk galaxies .",
    "our data probe @xmath1 pc scales in both galaxies , and thus allow us to study the distributions of stars and gas at the centers of these galaxies to investigate agn fueling . in ngc 1194 , an s0 , there is very little gas , and with our s / n ratios , we can not say much about the two - dimensional velocity or dispersion fields .",
    "however , in ngc 4388 we have excellent s / n , and uncover a variety of interesting features :    1 .",
    "the stellar velocity field demonstrates well - ordered rotation aligned with the kpc - scale disk .",
    "although there is net rotation in the stars , still they are kinematically hot , with @xmath79 , likely dominated by the dispersion in the kpc - scale bulge .",
    "2 .   in the inner 1  ( 100 pc )",
    ", we also see evidence for a nuclear disk , offet in pa by 15  from the kpc - scale disk .",
    "the evidence includes disky isophotes in the _",
    "hst_/wfc3 f160w image and a distinct drop in stellar velocity dispersion on one side of the putative disk ( the other side apparently extincted ) .",
    "features like this , so called @xmath84drops , have been seen in the centers of a number of nearby spirals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there is some hint that they are more common among actively accreting galaxies @xcite .",
    "we note that this 100 pc - scale nuclear disk is misaligned by @xmath1135  from the megamaser disk on sub - pc scales .",
    "the h@xmath4  gas also shows regular kinematics on @xmath143 pc scales , with a well - defined rotation field that is aligned with the kpc - scale disk . with a higher rotation amplitude ,",
    "the gas is considerably colder than the stars ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "we also see a kink in the rotation curve on @xmath2 pc scales .",
    "intriguingly , the h@xmath4  rotation within 100 pc appears to align with the megamaser disk .",
    "however , the physical origin of the kinematic twist is not yet clear .",

    "we conclude that the molecular hydrogen is mainly excited by thermal processes . based on the morphology and kinematics of the h@xmath4  gas",
    ", we speculate that these thermal processes are mostly associated with stars rather than radiation from the agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
