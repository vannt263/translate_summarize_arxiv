    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) sources were discovered historically in @xmath0-rays because they are rare and hence require continuous monitoring of large areas of the sky .",
    "the necessary all - sky monitoring program was first made feasible in the @xmath0-ray regime , hence the name grbs . by now , the prompt @xmath0-ray emission is known to be followed in most cases by delayed emission in the @xmath9-ray ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ) , optical ( van paradijs et al . 1997 ; bond 1997a , b ; fruchter et al .",
    "1998a ) and radio ( frail et al .",
    "1997a , b ; frail et al .",
    "1998a , b ; kulkarni et al . 1998b ; taylor at al .",
    "1998 ) bands .",
    "given the recent discovery of afterglows , it is now timely to explore the feasibility of searching for grb sources at longer wavelengths than traditionally attempted .",
    "the importance of complementary searches is highlighted by the possibility that some sources might be @xmath0-ray faint for geometric or physical reasons .",
    "such sources can only be found at long wavelengths , e.g. in radio surveys .",
    "all past discoveries of grb afterglows were selected by the detection of @xmath0-rays .",
    "if the @xmath0-ray emission is beamed , then there should be a population of radio afterglows which are @xmath0-ray faint ( rhoads 1997 ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting material in grb sources declines with time and is only of order unity when the late radio emission takes place ( waxman , kulkarni , & frail 1998 ) , hence making the effect of relativistic beaming weak at that time . in popular synchrotron models ( e.g. meszaros & rees 1997 ;",
    "waxman 1997a , 1997b ) , the gradual drift of the peak flux to lower frequencies as a function of time is caused by the decline of the lorentz factor of the emitting material , and so the minimum solid angle into which the radiation could be focused increases with time .",
    "if the @xmath0-ray emission is beamed into a fraction @xmath10 of the sky , then the rate of radio afterglows could be larger than the measured rate of grbs by up to @xmath11 . for relativistic expansion with a lorentz factor @xmath12 , the radiation observed at a given time @xmath13 originates from a conical section of opening angle @xmath14 of the fireball .",
    "the smallest value possible for @xmath10 is therefore @xmath15 , where @xmath12 is the lorentz factor at the time of the @xmath0-ray emission . since typical grb sources have @xmath16 ( e.g. , fenimore , epstein , & ho 1993 ; woods & loeb 1995 )",
    "while the radio afterglow emission occurs when @xmath17 , the rate of radio afterglows could be boosted by @xmath18 order of magnitudes relative to the measured grb rate .",
    "the total energy associated with a grb explosion is proportional to @xmath10 and is similarly uncertain .",
    "thus , the determination of @xmath10 is of crucial importance for identifying the likely astrophysical origin of grbs .",
    "the evolution of a jet resembles that of a spherical fireball ( i.e. the jet behaves as a conical section of a spherical fireball ) , as long as the expansion lorentz factor is larger than the inverse of the jet opening angle , @xmath19 .",
    "the smooth power - law decline of optical afterglows , observed over a time scale of days to months for grb970508 and grb970228 ( livio et al .",
    "1997 ; sokolov et al .",
    "1998 ) , suggests that these fireballs behaved as if they were spherically symmetric on angular scales ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21 ( rhoads 1997 , 1998 ; waxman 1997a ) .",
    "however , there is still a missing gap in afterglow observations on the time window of minutes to several hours following a grb . during this time the fireball decelerates from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , and",
    "so there is uncertainty about the structure of the fireball on angular scales @xmath240.1 radians .",
    "it is still possible that the highly relativistic expansion with @xmath25 is restricted only to a very small angular diameter , @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , the popular grb scenarios of binary coalescence of compact stars or failed supernovae favor strong collimation over spherical expansion ( woosley 1998 ; fryer et al . 1998 ; meszaros et al .",
    "the search for long - wavelength transients with no grb counterparts can set important constraints on @xmath1 and hence on these models .",
    "current long - wavelength surveys only place weak limits on the beaming factor . in particular , existing supernova searches imply that at most @xmath27 of all transient optical events can not be classified as having classical supernovae lightcurves ( kirshner 1998 , private communication ) . since the supernova rate per galaxy is @xmath28 orders of magnitude higher than the grb rate ( wijers et al .",
    "1997 ) , the enhancement factor due to beaming in the optical band must be @xmath29 ( see woods & loeb 1998 for a more detailed discussion ) . the enhancement factor could still be an order of magnitude higher in the radio than in the optical .",
    "previous radio experiments such as clfrt at 0.151 ghz ( dessenne et al . 1996 ) , and cobe at 90 ghz ( ali et al . 1997 ) do not provide useful limits on this factor , as they achieved only a sensitivity of 10100 jy which is well above the characteristic mjy radio flux of grb afterglows .    in this _",
    ", we show that a @xmath30 mjy radio survey at the vla [ analogous to the first survey ( helfand et al . 1996 ) ] can provide strong constraints on @xmath1 .",
    "the surveyed sources need to be sampled at least twice over a timescale of order a month or longer , since short term variability may also be caused by scintillations of steady pointlike sources .    in our calculations ,",
    "we assume that the grb rate is proportional to the cosmic star formation rate and neglect the small fraction ( @xmath31 ) of grbs which might be related to local radio supernovae ( bloom et al .",
    "we model the time - dependent luminosity of the radio afterglows based on observational data and allow for a scatter in their peak luminosities .",
    "our model is described in detail in  2 .",
    "the number counts of radio afterglows that it predicts for radio surveys are calculated in  3 . finally , ",
    "4 summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "the isotropy of grbs ( meegan et al . 1993 ; briggs at al . 1993 ) and the flattening of their number count distribution at faint fluxes suggest that most grbs occur at cosmological distances .",
    "this hypothesis has been confirmed by the detection of fe ii and mg ii absorption lines at a redshift of @xmath32 in the optical spectrum of grb 970508 ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , the inference of a redshift @xmath33 for the host galaxy of grb 971214 ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998a ) , and the detection of emission and absorption lines at @xmath34 for the host of grb980703 ( djorgovski et al . 1998 ) .    the energy scale of cosmological grbs , @xmath35 ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998a ) , corresponds to the rest mass energy of a fraction of a solar mass , and implies a link between their energy budget and compact stars .",
    "indeed , the most popular models for the origin of grbs relate them to compact stellar remnants , such as neutron stars or black holes ( e.g. paczyski 1986 , 1998 ; eichler et al . 1989 ; narayan et al . 1992 ; usov 1992 ; woosley 1993 ; rees 1998 ; popham , woosley , & fryer 1998 ; meszaros et al .",
    "since these remnants form out of massive stars not long after their birth , it is reasonable to assume that the grb rate traces the star formation rate without a significant delay .",
    "this scenario was investigated by wijers et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who derived a best - fit constant of proportionality between the grb occurrence rate , @xmath36 , and the star formation rate per comoving volume , @xmath37 , based on the requirement that the former fits the observed number count distribution of grbs . the cosmic star formation rate as a function of redshift has been calibrated based on observations of the @xmath38 and @xmath39-band luminosity density evolution in the hubble deep field ( madau et al . 1996 ; madau 1996 ; madau 1997 ; madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) . the fit made by wijers et al . ( 1997 ) yields a local grb rate of @xmath40 in an @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 cosmology .",
    "we model the frequency and time dependence of the afterglow luminosity , @xmath44 , using the simplest unbeamed synchrotron model ( e.g. waxman 1997a , 1997b ) , with a luminosity per unit emitted frequency @xmath45 of @xmath46^{-\\alpha}\\ , , \\label{eq : lum}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , @xmath13 is time at the source frame , and @xmath48 is the source redshift . the observed frequency @xmath49 is related to the emitted frequency @xmath50 through @xmath51 .",
    "the spectral index @xmath52 is chosen to have the values @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 , so as to match the temporal decay slope observed for grb 970228 ( galama et al .",
    "1997 ; fruchter et al .",
    "1998b ) and grb 970508 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we consider a population of afterglow sources characterized by a total comoving rate per unit volume , @xmath36 , and by a peak flux @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the cosmology - dependent luminosity distance .",
    "for consistency with the numbers derived by wijers et al .",
    "( 1997 ) we assume @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "note that if the radio flux of grb sources is strictly proportional to their @xmath0ray flux , then our number count results are independent of the choice of cosmological parameters to zeroth order ; this follows from the fact that wijers et al .",
    "( 1997 ) calibrate their results based on grb number count data .",
    "we allow for a spread in the peak luminosity @xmath61 of the afterglows by using a log - normal probability distribution ( and thus minimizing the number of free parameters ) , @xmath62 ^ 2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right\\ } { dl_{\\nu_m}\\over l_{\\nu_m}}\\;. \\label{eq : pl}\\ ] ] the mean of this distribution equals @xmath63 .",

    ". the observed 8.44 ghz lightcurves of grb970508 , grb980329 , and grb980703 yield @xmath65 mjy . for the above cosmology",
    ", this implies @xmath66 erg @xmath67 .    the calculation of the afterglow number counts should also incorporate the fact that not all grbs have afterglows at radio frequencies .",
    "the fraction @xmath68 of radio - loud grbs is still uncertain , but the observation that 4 out of @xmath6917 well - localized grbs ( namely , grb970508 , grb980329 , grb980519 and grb980703 ) were detected in the radio ( d. frail 1998 , private communication ) , implies that @xmath70 .",
    "also , the afterglow radio flux might have a break in its power - law evolution and decay more rapidly than predicted by equation  ( [ eq : lum ] ) after a particular time ( e.g. , during the non - relativistic phase of the shock hydrodynamics ) .",
    "we artificially introduce a free parameter , @xmath71 , after which we set the emitted radio flux to zero .",
    "current data does not allow an empirical calibration of @xmath72 and so we leave it as a free parameter .",
    "we assume that @xmath73 months since a simple power - law decline was observed in grb970508 over 3 months ( waxman et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the late phase of the radio emission , several months after a grb event , originates from semi - relativistic material with @xmath74 and receives only weak relativistic beaming .",
    "however , the @xmath0-ray emission is emitted by material with @xmath16 and could be confined to a cone with an angular diameter @xmath75 . in this case , the rate of radio afterglows would be enhanced by a factor @xmath76 , relative to the unbeamed case .",
    "typical radio surveys do not provide continuous monitoring of the sky , but rather a sequence of `` snapshots '' of each resolution element on the sky . in observations where the minimum detectable flux of a source is @xmath77 ,",
    "the total number of events across the sky that are brighter than @xmath77 at observed frequency @xmath49 is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 here @xmath80  is the comoving volume element within a solid angle @xmath81 and redshift interval @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is found from the algebraic relation @xmath84 .",

    "the vla first survey monitored 1550 degrees of sky with a sensitivity of 1 mjy at a frequency of 1.5 ghz ( helfand et al .",
    "the intervals between the observations of each source ranged between 3 minutes and 3 weeks .",
    "unfortunately , the properties of this survey were not optimal for the purpose of identifying grb afterglows .",
    "here we consider a hypothetical survey which is optimized for this purpose .",
    "such a survey would use a higher frequency in order to avoid the suppression of the afterglow flux by synchrotron self - absorption at the source ( typically observed at @xmath88^{-1}$ ] ghz ) .",
    "moreover , since short - term variability could also be caused by scintillations , the surveyed sources should be monitored at least twice over an extended period of order a month or more .",
    "after a few months all the radio - loud afterglows would fade significantly and thus be easily distinguishable from other variable source populations .",
    "the variability level of @xmath5@xmath89 mjy sources can be determined accurately , given the high sensitivity of the vla .",
    "figure 1 shows the number of radio afterglows that are expected to be found in an all - sky survey at 10 ghz , as a function of its flux threshold .",
    "the plotted number depends on a normalization factor involving the @xmath0ray beaming angle @xmath1 in units of @xmath90 .",
    "we assume @xmath91 and show results for different values of @xmath92 while keeping @xmath72 fixed at 6 months .",
    "figure 2 shows the same for @xmath93 but for different values of @xmath71 .",
    "typically , a 0.1 mjy survey similar to first but at 10 ghz would identify @xmath94 afterglows across the sky if the @xmath0-ray emission from grbs is collimated to within an opening angle @xmath1 .",
    "lower limits on the value of @xmath1 can already be placed by existing radio surveys .",
    "the total number of radio sources observed on the sky provides a robust upper limit on the number of grb afterglows .",
    "this limit can be improved by considering only those sources which are unresolved and at the same time variable over a time scale of a month or longer .",
    "still tighter constraints can be obtained by considering only the subset of all unidentified sources that after a sufficiently long time , @xmath7 6 months , fade away below the detection threshold . from a deep vla survey , windhorst et al .",
    "( 1993 ) derived a maximum - likelyhood fit to the source number counts at 8.44 ghz in the flux range of 14.5@xmath95jy1.5mjy . by comparing a westerbork and",
    "a vla survey of the same field at 1.4 ghz , oort & windhorst ( 1985 ) found that about 10% of the sources were variable on a time scale of a year , and only @xmath96 were detected in one survey but not in the other .",
    "thus , only @xmath96 of the sources in this survey qualify as candidates for grb afterglows .",
    "the sub - mjy sources were typically found to be unresolved .",
    "better angular resolution could in principle limit further the number of afterglow candidates by resolving other source populations .",

    "based on the observed abundance of unresolved variable sub - mjy sources at 1.4 ghz ( oort & windhorst 1985 ) , we set @xmath101 .",
    "the ratio between the predicted afterglow counts and the observed radio counts peaks around @xmath102@xmath103 mjy . from the requirement that this ratio be smaller than unity",
    ", we get the lower limit @xmath104 .",
    "this limit is based on the variability statistics of only @xmath105 sources ( oort & windhorst 1985 ) and hence suffers from large statistical uncertainties ( min@xmath106 ) .",
    "surveys with a larger coverage of the sky are necessary in order to firm up the statistical significance of this limit .",
    "we have found that a @xmath30 mjy all - sky survey at 10 ghz should identify @xmath107 grb afterglows , and could therefore place important constraints on the grb beaming angle , @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the total number of @xmath108 mjy sources on the sky at 8.44 ghz ( windhorst et al . 1993 ) and the fraction of fading unresolved sources at 1.4 ghz ( oort & windhorst 1985 ) , already yield the crude lower limit @xmath104 .",
    "this result is only weakly sensitive to the width of the afterglow luminosity function ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and is mainly uncertain due to the limited size of the sample of sub - mjy sources that had been monitored for long - term variability ( oort & windhorst 1985 ) . nevertheless ,",
    "the derived constraint is interesting , given the fact that the @xmath0-ray emission in grb sources originates from material with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath109 and could have been collimated to within an angle @xmath110 , narrower by more than an order of magnitude than our limit . in comparison ,",
    "radio jets in quasars are collimated to within @xmath111 and possess lorentz factors @xmath112 ( begelman , blandford , & rees 1984 ) .",
    "a future vla survey , optimized to search for radio afterglows by monitoring sub - mjy source variability at @xmath113 ghz over a timescale of several weeks to several months , could improve the above upper limit on @xmath1 considerably .",
    "alternatively , such a search might identify a new class of radio afterglow events which fade away after a few months and have no grb counterparts .",
