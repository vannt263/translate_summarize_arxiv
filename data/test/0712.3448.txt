    "physics of one - dimensional ( 1d ) objects is predicted to be qualitatively different form that of higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "the most spectacular examples include a breakdown of the fermi liquid theory @xcite and peierls metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "theorists found the one - dimensional physics to be very elegant , as many problems can be solved in 1d but not in higher dimensions . on the other hand ,",
    "experimentalists face with great difficulties in fabricating truly one - dimensional structures .",
    "the most promising way is a creation of such structures on semiconducting or insulating substrates @xcite . in this case , the chain atomic structure is governed by the substrate lattice .",
    "more importantly , the electrons near the fermi energy are completely decoupled from the substrate , as there is a band gap in the electronic spectrum of the substrate .",
    "of course , there are low energy states responsible for holding chain atoms on the surface .",
    "fortunately , only the states near the fermi level determine electronic properties of the system .",
    "recently , the most extensively studied templates for fabrication of one - dimensional objects are vicinal si(111 ) surfaces @xcite .",
    "those include gold induced chains on si(111 ) @xcite , si(335 ) @xcite-@xcite , si(553 ) @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , si(557 ) @xcite-@xcite , si(775 ) @xcite or si(5512 ) @xcite-@xcite .    the stepped si(335)-au reconstruction is observed at the gold coverage of 0.28 ml and consists of si(111 ) terraces @xmath0}$ ] ( 1.26 nm ) wide .",
    "each terrace contains a single row of gold atoms running parallel to the step edge , i.e. in the @xmath1 $ ] direction .",
    "a number of techniques has been employed to investigate structural and electronic properties of si(335)-au surface .",
    "those include high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) @xcite , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , stm topography data show a single monatomic chain on each terrace , which has been interpreted as the si atoms with broken bonds at the step edge @xcite .",
    "as the au atoms are more electronegative than si , they pair neighboring si bond with their @xmath2 , @xmath3 electrons . as a result , a low - lying bound state , not visible to stm ,",
    "is created .",
    "the stm experiments show a single chain within each terrace , so one would naively expect a single metallic band in electronic structure .",
    "however , arpes data show not one but two bands crossing the fermi level @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to solve this puzzle and to identify the bands observed in the arpes experiment .",
    "while the surfaces like si(553)-au or si(557)-au were extensively studied theoretically @xcite , there are no first principles investigations of the si(335)-au surface .",
    "moreover , there is no structural model confirmed by first principles calculations .",
    "however , the model of this surface , based on an analogy with si(557)-au surface , has been proposed in ref .",
    "it is simply a truncation of the si(557)-au structure .",
    "so the second purpose of the present work is to check whether the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is a good candidate for the atomic reconstruction of si(335)-au surface . in the following ,",
    "i will focus on the presentation of the results regarding structural model and electronic properties of the system .",
    "the calculations have been performed using the siesta code @xcite-@xcite , which performs standard pseudopotential density functional calculations using a linear combination of numerical atomic orbitals as a basis set .",
    "i have used here the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to dft @xcite , troullier - martins norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite , and a double-@xmath4 polarized ( dzp ) basis set for all the atomic species @xcite . a brillouin zone sampling of 24 inequivalent @xmath5 points , and a real - space grid equivalent to a plane - wave cutoff of 225 ry ( up to 82 @xmath5 points and 300 ry in the convergence tests ) have been employed .",
    "this guarantees the convergence of the total energy within @xmath6 mev per atom in the supercell .",
    "the si(335)-au system has been modeled by slabs containing up to four silicon double layers plus reconstructed surface layer .",
    "all the atomic positions were relaxed except the bottom layer .",
    "the si atoms in the bottom layer were saturated with hydrogen and remained at the bulk ideal positions during the relaxation process . to avoid artificial stresses ,",
    "the lattice constant of si was fixed at the calculated bulk value , 5.42  , which is very close to the experimental value of 5.43  .",
    "the total energy calculations show that it is energetically very favorable for the au atoms to substitute into the top si layer .",
    "the surface energy gain per unit cell is more than 1 ev as compared to adsorption above the surface .",
    "furthermore , the au substitution in the terraces is more stable than adsorption of the au atoms at the step edge ( by about @xmath7 ev per unit cell ) .",
    "similar conclusions have been obtained for the case of si(557)-au surface , where the au atoms prefer to substitute in the topmost si layer , too @xcite . therefore , in the following , i will focus on the structural models featuring the si top layer atoms substituted by the gold .    the most stable model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . however , the other models , in which the au atoms occupy various top layer silicon positions , from si@xmath8 to si@xmath9 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] for labeling ) , have comparable energies .",
    "the differences are usually less than @xmath10 ev per unit cell , and the next best structural model , in which the gold occupies the si@xmath11 position , differs in energy by 182 mev only .",
    "the total energies of the above models with respect to the most stable model are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the present model is simply the model proposed by crain _",
    "@xcite , which has not been deduced from any total energy calculations but was based on an analogy with si(557)-au model  a simple truncation of si(557)-au surface . here",
    ", the dft calculations confirm that this model is a good candidate for si(335)-au surface reconstruction . as one can read off from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the au atoms sit in the middle of the terrace and the rigidity of the si structure keeps the au wire stable against dimerization .",
    "the calculated au - si@xmath12 bond length 2.43  and 2.38  for au - si@xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is quite close to calculated bulk si - si distance of 2.35  , indicating that au atoms affect the si structure very little .",
    "another important feature is a strong rebonding of the si atoms near the step edge .",
    "the step edge atoms tend to saturate the dangling bonds in the neighboring terrace . as a result ,",
    "a sort of honeycomb building block is created at the step edge , originally proposed for the alkali - induced @xmath13 reconstruction of si(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this sub - structure is a common feature of other au - decorated si vicinal surfaces @xcite .",
    "the calculated band structure for this structural model , along the high symmetry line of two - dimensional brillouin zone ( fig . [ fig2 ] ) , is shown in fig .",
    "the line defined by points @xmath14 , k and m is parallel to the steps , i.e. it goes along the au chains .",
    "the mulliken population analysis @xcite has been performed in order to identify the main character of the bands .",
    "although this analysis is not completely unambiguous , it is particularly useful for surface states . the band marked with open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , pinning the fermi energy , comes from unsaturated bonds of the si atoms at the step edge .",
    "a rather flat band around 0.5 ev below the fermi energy ( open squares ) , as well as a more dispersive band crossing the fermi energy ( filled squares ) have the au character .",
    "this picture looks a little bit counterintuitive , as one would expect a single band associated with @xmath2 electrons of gold .",
    "in fact , these bands come from the si atoms neighboring to the au chain ( si@xmath12 and si@xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and have gold character due to the hybridization .",
    "the 6s state of gold is well below the fermi energy , thus completely occupied .",
    "the flat band marked with open squares comes from the si@xmath12 atoms , while the other , more dispersive one ( filled squares ) , comes form the si@xmath9 atoms .",
    "there is one more band worth mentioning , not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , having its origin in unsaturated bonds of the si@xmath11 atoms .",
    "this band is also very flat , indicating its surface nature , and is located around 1 ev above the fermi level .",
    "all the bands discussed above have also been identified in the case of si(557)-au surface @xcite .",
    "this similarity can be easily understood if one recalls that the si(335)-au surface is a truncation of the si(557)-au surface , as discussed previously .",
    "thus , similar bands , although having different @xmath15 dependence , should also be observed here .    a comparison of the calculated band structure with the photoemission spectra of ref .",
    "@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "as one can see , the present dft calculations agree very well with the experimental data . in particular , there are two bands crossing the fermi energy , one associated with the step edge si atoms , and the other one coming mainly from the si atoms neighboring to the au chain . moreover , the shape of those bands and the values of @xmath15 , for which the bands cross the fermi level , remain in good agreement with experiment .",
    "unfortunately , a more detailed comparison between present calculations and experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite is not possible , as the photoemission spectra were measured in the energy window between @xmath16 and -0.5 ev .",
    "however , i expect the agreement not be worse for lower energies .    at this point",
    "i would like to comment on the band structure of the other models studied here .",
    "since the energy differences between all these models are rather small , it is natural to compare the band structure with the arpes data",
    ". this would be the convincing criterion that the structural model is the correct one or at least is very close to the true si(335)-au surface reconstruction .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a comparison of the arpes data ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the band structure calculated for the next best structural model , in which the au atoms occupy the si@xmath11 positions ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this model does not give as good agreement with the experimental data as the original one .",
    "in particular , there are three electronic bands crossing the fermi energy , and none of them crosses the @xmath16 at the correct @xmath15 .",
    "the other models studied here also give wrong values of @xmath15 at which the electronic bands cross the fermi energy .",
    "thus , this is an additional argument supporting the validity of the model shown in fig .",
    "in conclusion , the structural and electronic properties of si(335)-au surface have been discussed within the density functional theory .",
    "the dft calculations revealed that the most stable structural model contains one au atom per unit cell , which substitutes the si atom in the middle of terrace in the surface layer .",
    "the calculated electronic structure agrees well with photoemission experimental data , showing two metallic bands .",
    "the less dispersive band comes from the si atoms at the step edge , while the other one originates from hybridization between the au and the neighboring si atoms in the middle of the terrace in the surface layer .",
