    "in two recent papers @xcite , a new calculation of the phase shift of a matter - wave interferometer caused by the passage of a gravitational wave was presented .",
    "this calculation was based not on the usual geodesic equation of motion ( eom ) , but rather on the geodesic _ deviation _ eom .",
    "contrary to expectations , these phase shifts have a form that is very much different from those calculated previously in the literature @xcite .",
    "while a direct comparison of the various expressions for the phase shift is difficult because of the different configurations of the matter - wave interferometers used for their calculations , it was noted in @xcite that the power - law dependence on the frequency of the gravitational wave , in both the low- and high - frequency limit , of the expressions calculated in @xcite are at times diametrically opposite to those calculated in @xcite .",
    "consequently , we expect that the differences between these expressions are _ not _ due simply to differences in the configurations of the interferometers chosen , but are rather caused by fundamental differences in the physics on which their derivations are based .    in this paper",
    "our objective is to demonstrate that these fundamental differences do exist by presenting a series of calculations that follows the two basic approaches in the literature used to determine the phase shift caused by a gravitational wave .",
    "this will be done for the _ same _ configuration of matter - wave interferometer , and will allow us to compare the different expressions we obtain for the phase shift on an equal footing .",
    "we then determine their validity by comparing each of them , in the appropriate limit , with the well - known expression for the phase shift caused by _",
    "stationary _ sources of spacetime curvature @xcite .",
    "the focus in this paper will be on a _ theoretical _ study of the underlying physics ; we leave issues of the practicality and feasibility of constructing the interferometer to @xcite .",
    "the various approaches taken to determine the phase shift of a matter - wave interferometer caused by a gravitational wave can be divided into two distinctly separate classes .",
    "the class of approaches that is more often found in the literature @xcite is done in transverse - traceless ( tt ) coordinates ( see sec .",
    "9.2.3 of @xcite ) , either explicitly or implicitly .",
    "the tt coordinates are one specific choice of reference frame where the gravitation wave is in the tt gauge . in this frame",
    "the number of components of the deviations of the flat spacetime metric @xmath0 caused by the gravitational wave equals the number of physical degrees of freedom of the gravitational wave .",
    "consequently , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the mirrors and the beam splitters are at fixed coordinate values in these coordinates , and they do not move .",
    "these coordinates have been used to study the properties of light - wave - interferometry - based detectors of gravitational waves as well @xcite . to calculate the phase shift for matter - wave interferometers ,",
    "it is combined with either the geodesic eom ( and its action ) , if the calculation is done at the quantum - mechanical level @xcite , or the lagrangian ( and the wkb or stationary phase approximation ) for a quantum field in curved spacetime , if the calculation is done at the quantum field - theoretic level @xcite . not surprisingly , irrespective of the level of sophistication of the approach used , the general expressions calculated for the phase shift have the same final form .",
    "the other class of approaches to calculating the phase shift is taken by @xcite , and is done in thorne s `` proper reference frame '' .",
    "they follow the classical analysis in @xcite for light - wave - based interferometers . in this frame , the positions and velocities of test particles are measured relative to the worldline of an observer , and follow the motion of the observer in spacetime , in much the same way that the fermi - normal @xcite , fermi - walker coordinates @xcite , and the recently constructed general laboratory frame @xcite do .",
    "consequently , the motion of the test particle in this frame is _ not _ described by the usual geodesic equation of motion ( eom ) , but rather by the geodesic _ deviation _ eom ( see eq .",
    "( 2 ) of @xcite ) , which was first applied to the analysis of physical systems in @xcite . as in @xcite ,",
    "the tt gauge was taken for the gravitational wave .",
    "the action ( see @xcite ) for the geodesic deviation eom was then used in conjunction with the quasi - classical approximation of the feynman - path - integral formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "this approximation is the lagrangian form of the wkb approximation in the schrdinger representation of quantum mechanics , and in @xcite it was applied to the calculation of the phase shift of the two matter - wave - interferometer configurations .",
    "the phase shift of a matter - wave interferometer is a physically measurable quantity . from the principle of general covariance , it should not matter whether the tt coordinates , or whether the proper reference frame is used in its calculation @xcite .",
    "indeed , thorne states the following :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` if @xmath4 then the [ gravitational wave ] detector can be contained entirely in the proper reference frame of its center , and the analysis can be performed using non - relativistic concepts augmented by the quadrupolar gravity - wave force field ( 3 ) , ( 5 ) .",

    "are fundamentally different from that of the phase shifts calculated in @xcite using the proper reference frame .",
    "since the principle of general covariance must hold , this means that either ( a ) the calculations in @xcite are wrong , ( b ) the calculations in @xcite are wrong , or ( c ) all of the calculations of the phase shifts are wrong .    to determine which one of these three possibilities is correct , we will present side by side calculations of the phase shift caused by a gravitational wave for one specific matter - wave - interferometer configuration using the following three approaches .",
    "the first calculation uses the quasi - classical approximation in the tt coordinates and geodesic action , and is done at the nonrelativistic , quantum - mechanics level .",
    "it follows , as much as possible , the line of analysis given in @xcite .",
    "the second calculation is also done at the nonrelativistic , quantum - mechanics level using the same approximation , but now in the proper reference frame , and uses the geodesic _ deviation _ action .",
    "it follows the line of analysis given in @xcite .",
    "these two calculations would seem to exhaust the two different classes of approaches currently found in the literature .",
    "that a third calculation of the phase shift is needed is because of an error in @xcite . either",
    "because changes in the kinetic energy term in the action for the atom in @xcite were neglected , or because the turning points of the atom s phase at the interferometer s mirrors in the wkb - type of approach in @xcite were omitted , the end result is that important boundary terms are not included in the final expression for the phase shift in @xcite . for the sake of completeness , and to compare the calculations in @xcite with these previous calculations in the literature , this necessitates a _",
    "third _ calculation of the phase shift , which will result in yet another expression for the phase shift based on the geodesic eom .",
    "we find that all three expressions for the phase shift calculated here are different from one another . although there are currently no _",
    "direct _ experimental checks that can used to determine which one of these three expressions for the phase shift is correct , an _ indirect _",
    "experimental check can be used by taking the low - frequency limit .",
    "all three expressions for the phase shift depend on the transit time of the atom through the interferometer , and the period of the gravitational wave .",
    "if the transit time of the atom is much shorter than the period , then , with respect to the atom , the gravitational wave does not oscillate appreciably as it traverses the interferometer .",
    "the gravitational wave will contribute a local riemannian curvature to the spacetime that is effectively static .",
    "the phase shift of matter - interferometers caused by static ( as well as stationary ) sources of curvature is well established @xcite , and has been shown to be proportional to components of the riemann curvature tensor . just as importantly",
    ", this phase shift can be calculated using only newtonian gravity [ eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) of @xcite ] .",
    "the phase shift due to the newtonian gravitational potentialthrough the acceleration due to earth s gravity @xmath5has been measured , first by collela , overhauser and werner @xcite , and more recently by chu and kasevich @xcite .",
    "these more recent measurements of the phase shift induced by @xmath5 are sensitive enough that effect of _ spatial variations _ in @xmath5which are proportional to the static riemann curvature of the spacetime caused by the earthon the phase shift can be discerned .",
    "gradients in @xmath5 were seen through _ changes _ in the phase shift of an atomic fountain when its vertical position was varied @xcite .",
    "more recently , they were seen through a differential measurement of the phase shifts of two atomic fountain matter - wave interferometers operating in tandem @xcite .",
    "therefore , while the direct measurement of the phase shift of a matter - wave interferometer caused by a static riemann curvature tensor has not been made , its discovery is expected .",
    "indeed , indications are that the phase shift induced by the static riemann curvature of the earth has already been seen @xcite .    as a consequence of the above , in the limit of low - frequency gravitational waves the phase shift calculated for the matter - wave interferometer _ must _ approach the well - known static result , and be proportional to the curvature tensor .",
    "we will see that in this limit , only the phase shift calculated along the lines of @xcite has the correct form .",
    "the other two do not , and _ must be wrong _",
    ", since they do not yield the correct static limit .",
    "our focus here is on the phase shift that a _ gravitational wave _ will induce on a matter - wave interferometer .",
    "we will thus neglect the effects of all other gravitational effectssuch as the acceleration due to earth s gravity , and the local curvature of spacetime due to _ stationary _ sources such as the earth , sun and moonin addition to the phase shift due to the sagnac effect caused by the earth s rotation .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that for these types of stationary gravitational effects the description of the motion of test particles in the general laboratory frameof which the proper reference frame is a special casereduces to the usual geodesic eom description , and there is no controversy .",
    "the phase shifts caused by these stationary effects calculated in either the proper reference frame or the tt coordinates will be the same .",
    "we will in this paper use the same notation the is commonly found in the literature @xcite . in particular , it follows the notation in @xcite .",
    "while this has the benefit of consistency and simplicity , it means that we do not separate with notation the coordinates used for the tt coordinates from the coordinate used for the proper reference frame .",
    "the coordinates used in the two reference frames have different physical meanings , which we will make clear in the next section .",
    "these differences are outlined in detail in @xcite .",
    "in this section we will present two of the three calculations of the phase shift mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the first calculation will be done in the tt coordinates , and will be based on the geodesic eom .",
    "the second calculation will be done in the proper reference frame , and will be based on the geodesic deviation eom .",
    "a third calculation , following the approach in the literature , will be done in the next section where comparisons between the different results of the calculations are made .",
    "all three calculations are done for gravitational waves in the long - wavelength limit for the matter - wave interferometer configuration shown in fig .",
    "@xmath6 ; this configuration is described in detail in * appendix a*. to calculate the phase shifts , we will use the quasi - classical approximation of the feynman path integral representation of quantum mechanics .",
    "this approximation is the lagrangian version of the wkb approximation , or stationary phase approximation , in the schrdinger representation of quantum mechanics , and will be reviewed in * appendix a * as well .",
    "the presentation in this section is done in detail to ensure that all the underlying assumptions , approximations , and subtleties in our analysis are readily apparent .",
    "consider a gravitational wave in the long - wavelength limit with an amplitude @xmath7 incident perpendicularly to the plane of the interferometer in fig .",
    "@xmath6 . as usual ,",
    "greek indices run from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , and latin indices run from @xmath10 to @xmath11 . the gravitational wave is represented by the tensor @xmath0 as a perturbation on the flat spacetime metric @xmath12 , so that the total metric of the spacetime is @xmath13 .",
    "we have chosen the signature of @xmath14 to be @xmath15 . in the tt - gauge ,",
    "a coordinate system is chosen so that in these coordinates , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath3 ; the only nonvanishing components of @xmath0 are thus @xmath18 .",
    "one choice of coordinates where the tt gauge is realized is the tt coordinates ( see @xcite and the general analysis in @xcite ) .",
    "in these coordinates the action for the atom with mass @xmath19 used in fig .",
    "@xmath6 is the usual geodesic action in the nonrelativistic limit , @xmath20dt , \\label{geoaction}\\ ] ] where the subscript `` geo '' stands for `` geodesic '' .",
    "since the rest mass @xmath21 only shifts the lagrangian for the atom by a constant , we drop this term from @xmath22 .",
    "the nonrelativistic hamiltonian for the motion is then , @xmath23 which results in the usual geodesic equation of motion @xmath24 here @xmath25 is christoffel symbol for the spacetime ; for gravitational waves in the tt gauge , @xmath26 .    to calculate the phase shift of fig .",
    "@xmath6 , we follow the description in * appendix a * , and consider the phase shift due to the @xmath27th atom emitted from the atomic source , which at a time @xmath28 is diffracted by the initial beam splitter .",
    "there are two possible classical paths for the atom through the interferometer . in the absence of gravitational waves ,",
    "these are straight - line paths @xmath29 ( see * appendix a * ) , which will be shifted when a gravitational wave is present .",
    "these shifts are expected to be very small , however , and we can use perturbation theory to solve for them .",
    "we thus take @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are perturbations to the atom s path @xmath29 and velocity @xmath34 , respectively ; we will keep only terms linear in @xmath33 . to first order in @xmath18 , eq .",
    "@xmath35 becomes @xmath36 once @xmath29 is determined , @xmath37 is solved for by dividing the trajectory of an atom into two parts : from the initial beam splitter to the mirror , and then from the mirror to the final beam splitter .",

    "we will assume that the velocity of the atoms is high enough that we can ignore the effect of earth s gravity on the atom .",
    "it is then clear that for @xmath39during which it travels between the initial beam splitter and the first mirror in a time @xmath40the path of the atom is @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are @xmath44 and @xmath45 components of the velocity of the atom immediately after it leaves the initial beam splitter . at @xmath46",

    "this relative motion , on the other hand , is measured in the proper reference frame where the coordinates are explicitly constructed to span the distance between the measuring apparatus , and the test particle whose properties are to be measured .",
    "the motion of the measuring apparatus has been built in from the beginning , and indeed , the positions of the beam splitters and the mirrors shift during the passage of the gravitational wave .",
    "failing to take into account the motion of the measuring apparatus in spacetime is the underlying _ physical _ reason why the wrong expression was obtain for fig .",

    "in this * appendix * we set the framework used in our different calculations of the phase shift .      like stodolsky @xcite",
    ", we use the quasi - classical approximation to calculate the phase shift of an atom in a matter - wave interferometer .",
    "this approximation is the lagrangian version of the wkb , or stationary phase approximation , in the schrdinger representation of quantum mechanics .",
    "we assume that the density of particles through the interferometer is low enough that they do not interact with one another appreciably in the time it takes for the atom to traverse the interferometer . within this approximation ,",
    "the particles can be treated as test particles that interact only with the gravitational wave , and not with themselves .",
    "we can thus consider the phase shift of each atom individually , and use the feynman path integral method to calculate its phase shift .",
    "however , instead of integrating over all possible paths , we make the quasi - classical approximation , and consider only the most _ probable _ pathwhich is also the _ classical _ paththat the test particle takes through the interferometer ( see @xcite ) . as a result , @xmath242    -s^{cl}[x_a , x_b;\\gamma_2]\\bigg\\ } , \\label{def - phase - shift}\\ ] ] where the superscript `` cl '' stands for `` classical '' , and @xmath243 and @xmath244 are the two possible paths a classical test particle can take through the interferometer that links a common point @xmath245 on the interferometer ( the initial beam splitter , say ) to a common point @xmath246 on the interferometer ( the final beam splitter , say ) .",
    "note that @xmath247 $ ] are functionals of the points @xmath245 and @xmath246 , along with the paths @xmath243 and @xmath244 connecting them .    unlike @xcite , as well as the calculations of the phase shift done in @xcite",
    ", we will work in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "the reason for doing so is two fold .",
    "first , the proper reference frame , as well as the general laboratory frame and all the other reference frames based on the worldline of an observer , are constructed for nonrelativistic test particles .",
    "second , as is well known , the phase shift of a matter - wave interferometer is proportional to the mass of the particle .",
    "this argues for the use of atoms in matter - wave interferometers to detect gravitational waves , as was proposed in @xcite , and in any conceivable matter - wave interferometer , these atoms will be moving nonrelativistically .",
    "the configuration of the interferometer that we use in our calculations is shown in fig .",
    "details of this interferometer can be found in @xcite . for our purposes , it is sufficient to note that the interfering test particle in the interferometer is an atom with mass @xmath19 .",
    "a beam of these atoms is emitted from an atomic source with velocity @xmath248 , and is beam - split into different diffraction orders using a diffraction grating with periodicity @xmath249 ( see @xcite ) . only the @xmath38 and @xmath57 diffraction orders are used in the interferometer .",
    "there are two possible paths , denoted as @xmath38 and @xmath57 in fig .",
    "@xmath6 , that any individual atom can follow through the interferometer ; it is not possible to tell _ a priori _ which of the two paths an atom will take .",
    "if the atom is diffracted into the @xmath38 diffraction order , then immediately after the beam splitter it will have a velocity of @xmath250 perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the interferometer .",
    "similarly , if an atom is diffracted into the @xmath57 diffraction order , it will have a velocity of @xmath251 ( see fig .",
    ". since the diffraction grating does not impart energy to the atom , for both diffraction orders @xmath252 is the velocity of the atom parallel to the axis of the interferometer immediately after it leaves the beam splitter .    in @xcite the use of hard - wall ,",
    "specular reflection mirrors was considered for the matter - interferometer .",
    "mirrors of this type have been made from silicon wafers @xcite , and for near normal and near glancing angles , the reflection from these mirrors is close to 100% .",
    "these are not the mirrors that are currently used in matter - wave interferometry , however .",
    "mirrors based on diffraction gratings , standing waves of light , or stimulated raman pulses are used instead @xcite .",
    "we will nevertheless consider only the case of hard - wall mirrors in this paper , because of their simplicity . in the absence of gravitational waves , the effect of hard - wall mirrors ,",
    "if they do not move , on the velocity of the atoms through the interferometer is @xmath253 where @xmath254 and @xmath255 are , respectively , the velocity of the atom immediately before it is reflected off the mirror , and immediately afterwards .",
    "in this appendix we will show how the tt gauge can be taken in the general laboratory frame in a treatment that follows @xcite .    like the proper reference frame",
    ", the general laboratory frame is an orthonormal coordinate system fixed on the worldline of an observer . in our case it is fixed on the worldline of the initial beam splitter in fig .",
    "we choose a local tetrad @xmath256 fixed on the observer s worldline .",
    "thus , @xmath257 , while @xmath258 . in a slight break in the notation followed elsewhere in this paper , which follows the notational convention established in @xcite , we use in this * appendix * the convention taken in @xcite .",
    "thus , we use as the tetrad indices capital latin letters , which run from 0 to 3 .",
    "lower - case latin letters are used as the spatial tetrad indices , and they run from 1 to 3 . as usual ,",
    "greek letters are used for the spacetime indices of a general coordinate @xmath259 .    consider a the motion of a test particle @xmath260 close to the observer @xmath261 and her worldline .",
    "let @xmath262 be the position of @xmath263 at any proper time @xmath264 in the observer s frame .",
    "@xmath265 can also be considered as a coordinate transformation from the general coordinates @xmath259 to the tetrad frame at any time @xmath264 .",
    "thus in a small neighborhood @xmath266 of @xmath267 , @xmath268 so that @xmath269 integrating eq .",
    "@xmath270 , we find for the spatial coordinates @xmath271 where @xmath272 is a 1-form , and @xmath273 is a space - like geodesic linking @xmath261 to @xmath260 at a given proper time @xmath264 of the observer . next , after taking appropriate account of causality , the time component is @xmath274 where @xmath275 is a null - vector linking @xmath261 at time @xmath276 with @xmath260 at time @xmath264 ; the difference @xmath277 is the transit time of a light pulse emitted by @xmath261 , and scattered by @xmath260 .    in the case of linearized gravity , @xmath278 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that in terms of tetrads @xmath279 this choice is _ not _ unique . if one does a _",
    "local _ lorentz transformation @xmath280 on @xmath281 , then @xmath282 while @xmath283 .",
    "this leaves @xmath284 invariant .",
    "the usual derivation of the tt gauge makes use of a remnant of general coordinate transformation invariance still left in the linearized - gravity limit of general relativity . if @xmath285 where @xmath286 is a ` small ' , arbitrary vector , then @xmath0 transforms to @xmath287 one can choose @xmath286 such that @xmath288 can be chosen for gws in minkowski space .",
    "doing so defines a specific coordinate system , which is called the tt coordinates in @xcite .",
    "the tt gauge can also be implemented in the general laboratory frame as well . in terms of a tetrad frame , the linearized coordinate transformation eq .",
    "@xmath289 induces a lorentz transformation on the tetrads such that @xmath290 , where @xmath291 and @xmath292 . like",
    "the tt coordinates , the tt gauge can also be realized , but now through the appropriate lorentz transformation . from eq .",
    "@xmath270 , this in turn means we can choose the tt gauge in the construction of the general laboratory frame as well .",
    "in this * appendix * we consider the high - frequency limit of @xmath150 .    because of its dependence on three timescales ,",
    "the analysis of the high - frequency limit of @xmath150 is more involved than that for the low frequency limit .",
    "there are two cases to consider .",
    "the simplest case is when the transit time of the atom through the interferometer is very _ long _ in comparison with the period of the gravitational wave , so that @xmath293 , but @xmath166 still . to the atom",
    ", the mirrors still do not move in response to the gravitational wave , but the atom will experience many oscillations of the gravitational wave as it traverses the interferometer . in this limit",
    "the phase of the atom oscillates so fast that we would naively expect the phase shift to average to zero .",
    "it does not do so , however .",
    "we instead find that @xmath211 .",
    "that @xmath150 does not vanish in the limit of high - frequency gravitational waves is due to action of the mirrors on the atoms as they traverse through the interferometer .",
    "when the atoms reflect of the mirrors , they impart a impulsive force on the atoms that is effectively _ instantaneous _ ..",
    "since this is much shorter than any of the timescale considered here , the force can be considered as instantaneous . ]",
    "the effect of this force is readily apparent from the discontinuity in @xmath294 across the mirror in eqs .",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath117 .",
    "note in particular that the force is proportional to perturbed velocity @xmath295 of the atom _ caused by the gravitational wave _ , and is _ different _ depending on which path the atom travels through the interferometer , as can be seen from the force lines in fig .",
    "it is because of this net instantaneous force that @xmath150 does not average to zero in the high - frequency limit .",
    "when , @xmath296 as well , the mirrors themselves oscillate rapidly as the atom traverses the interferometer .",
    "this rapid motion of the mirror is not correlated with the motion of the atoms through the interferometer , however . when the atom reaches the mirror , roughly half the time it will be moving in the same direction as the mirror , which would , from eq .",
    "@xmath131 , tend to _ decelerate _ the atom",
    ". the other half of the time it will be moving in the opposite direction as the mirror , and would tend to _ accelerate _ the atom .",
    "not surprising , in this limit the resonance function decreases by a half , and @xmath297 .    in this high - frequency limit",
    "@xmath150 is _ not _ proportional to @xmath298 .",
    "there is no reason to expect it to be , as there was in the low - frequency limit , however . because the mirrors exert a net forcewhich itself is the result of the passage of the gravitational wave through the systemon the atom as it passes through the interferometer , @xmath299 .",
