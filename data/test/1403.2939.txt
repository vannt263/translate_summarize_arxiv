    "we observe that the protocol enhances both the average fidelity of teleportation and information splitting and prevents the channel from performing below the classical upper - limit .",
    "the weak measurement reversal protocol thus strengthens the robustness of global quantum correlations in multipartite systems under the effect of local amplitude damping .",
