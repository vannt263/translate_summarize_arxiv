    "resonance phenomena of nonlinear systems due to aperiodic and chaotic forcing functions  @xcite has been less studied , but results from work in this area indicate that generally a nonlinear oscillator will have a greater response when driven with the correct aperiodic signal rather than a sinusoidal one .",

    "plapp and hbler  @xcite and others  @xcite have used the calculus of variations to show that a special class of aperiodic driving forces can achieve a large energy transfer to a nonlinear oscillator .",

    "foster , and hbler  @xcite explored resonant forcing of time - discrete chaotic dynamics . in this work , we extend their method to time - continuous systems of ordinary differential equations , including but not limited to , the equations of motion of a particle in a potential , and show that the optimal forcing function induces a desired response more efficiently than a sinusoidal forcing function .",

    "this is motivated by the difficulty or impossibility of forcing all of the degrees of freedom in certain experiments .",
    "for example , consider a physical oscillator in which it is possible to directly force the position @xmath0 but not the velocity @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the method we present may be applied to a very general class of problems .",
    "we show analytically that the resonant forcing functions are closely related to the unperturbed dynamics of the system in that the product of the displacement of nearby trajectories and the effective total forcing function is a conserved quantity .",
    "we also show that the optimal forcing for a damped oscillator moving in a potential is proportional to the time reflected dynamics of the corresponding unperturbed system ; this is the `` principle of the dynamical key '' explored by hbler et al .",
    "furthermore , we find that certain lagrange multipliers take on a fundamental physical role as the efficiency of the forcing function and the effective forcing experienced by the degrees of freedom which are not forced directly .",

    "<S> we include the additional constraint that only select degrees of freedom be forced , corresponding to a very general class of problems in which not all of the degrees of freedom in an experimental system are accessible to forcing . </S>",
    "<S> we find that certain lagrange multipliers take on a fundamental physical role as the effective forcing experienced by the degrees of freedom which are not forced directly . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the product of the displacement of nearby trajectories and the effective total forcing function is a conserved quantity . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the efficacy of this methodology with several examples . </S>"
