    "next - generation mobile and cellular networks will require higher capacity and reliabilty , as well as power - efficiency .",
    "interference alignment ( ia ) , first introduced by maddah - ali , motahari and khandani in [ 1 ] and cadambe and jafar in [ 2 ] , made a very promising step in this direction by proving that it is possible that the @xmath0-user interference channel , under the assumption of global perfect csi , can have @xmath2 dof , i.e. `` everyone gets half the cake '' .",
    "the novelty of the ia scheme , as described in [ 1]-[3 ] , lies in the fact that it attempts to align , rather than cancel or reduce , interference along dimensions different from the dimensions of the actual signal .",
    "initially , the main drawbacks of ia were the requirement of global perfect csi at the transmitter ( csit ) , which resulted in feedback overhead , and its complexity , as only for the @xmath3 case , as presented in [ 4 ] , a closed - form solution could be easily described . in general , in the absence of perfect or partial csit , the dof of a network collapse , i.e transmissions are no longer reliable .",
    "however , for certain networks , the scheme of blind ia ( bia ) , originally presented by wang , gou and jafar in [ 5 ] and jafar in [ 6 ] , can achieve full dof , even when no csit is available .",
    "bia can be successfully achieved by a ) knowing distinct coherence patterns associated with different receivers , or b ) employing distinct antenna switching patterns at receivers equipped with reconfigurable antennas .",
    "furthermore , as suggested by jafar in [ 7 ] , bia can achieve even higher than @xmath2 dof in certain cellular environments simply by seeing frequency reuse as a simple form of ia .",
    "moreover , [ 7 ] introduced the feasibility of bia in heterogenous networks due to interference diversity , i.e. the observation that every receiver experiences a different set of interferers , and depending on the actions of its interferers , the interference - free signal subspace fluctuates differently from the rest of the receivers .",
    "finally , [ 8 ] and [ 9 ] introduced an equal - power allocation bia scheme that reduces noise enhancement by constant power transmission .    in this paper ,",
    "based on [ 5]-[7 ] , we propose a generalised model of bia in a heterogeneous network , where there is one macrocell with @xmath0 users and @xmath0 femtocells with one user each ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "our contribution is the generalisation of the construction given by jafar , [ 7 , section 6 ] in the case @xmath4 , introducing the application of bia to heterogeneous networks .",
    "moreover , this paper introduces a new description of the bia model using a kronecker product representation .",
    "based on our findings , the dof that can be achieved in both tiers of the network are presented .",
    "finally , we discuss how to vary parameters of the model to maximize sum rate , extending the ideas of [ 8]-[9 ] , and demonstrating optimality in the sum rate sense .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the general description of the bia model , including the determination of the beamforming matrices , and the whole decoding process .",
    "section iii presents the dof that can be achieved in the macrocell and the @xmath0 femtocells .",
    "section iv presents the achievable sum rate formula for the heterogenous network .",
