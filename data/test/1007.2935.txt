    "over the last many years appearance of persistent current in metallic single - channel rings and multi - channel cylinders has drawn much attention in theoretical as well as in experimental research .",
    "in mesoscopic regime where dimensions of a system are comparable to mean free path of an electron the phase coherence of electronic states is of fundamental importance and the existence of dissipationless current in a mesoscopic conducting ring threaded by an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) flux @xmath0 is a direct consequence of quantum phase coherence . in this new quantum regime ,",
    "two important aspects appear at low temperatures and they are as follows .",
    "+ @xmath1 the phase coherence length @xmath2 i.e. , the length scale for which an electron maintains its phase memory , increases significantly with the lowering of temperature and becomes comparable to the system size @xmath3 .",
    "+ @xmath1 the energy levels of these small finite size systems are discrete .",
    "+ these two are the most essential criteria for the existence of persistent current in a small metallic ring / cylinder due to the application of an external magnetic flux @xmath0 . in the pioneering work of bttiker , imry and landauer  @xcite ,",
    "the appearance of persistent current in metallic rings has been explored .",
    "later , many excellent experiments  @xcite have been carried out in several ring and cylindrical geometries to reveal the actual mechanisms of persistent current . though much efforts have been paid to study persistent current both theoretically  @xcite as well as experimentally  @xcite , yet",
    "several drawbacks still exist between the theory and experiment , and the full knowledge about it in this scale is not well established even today .",
    "the results of the single loop experiments are significantly different from those for the ensemble of isolated loops",
    ". persistent currents with expected @xmath4 periodicity have been observed in isolated single au rings  @xcite and in a gaas - algaas ring  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found oscillations with period @xmath5 rather than @xmath4 in an ensemble of @xmath6 independent cu rings .",
    "similar @xmath5 oscillations were also reported for an ensemble of disconnected @xmath7 ag rings  @xcite as well as for an array of @xmath7 isolated gaas - algaas rings  @xcite . in a recent experiment ,",
    "jariwala _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained both @xmath4 and @xmath5 periodic persistent currents in an array of thirty diffusive mesoscopic au rings . except for the case of the nearly ballistic gaas - algaas ring  @xcite ,",
    "all the measured currents are in general one or two orders of magnitude larger than those expected from the theory .",
    "free electron theory predicts that at @xmath8 , an ordered one - dimensional metallic ring threaded by magnetic flux @xmath0 supports persistent current with maximum amplitude @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the fermi velocity and @xmath3 is the circumference of the ring .",
    "metals are intrinsically disordered which tends to decrease the persistent current , and the calculations show that the disorder - averaged current @xmath11 crucially depends on the choice of the ensemble  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the current @xmath12 is however insensitive to the averaging issues , and is of the order of @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the elastic mean free path of the electrons .",
    "this expression remains valid even if one takes into account the finite width of the ring by adding contributions from the transverse channels , since disorder leads to a compensation between the channels  @xcite .",
    "however , the measurements on an ensemble of @xmath6 cu rings  @xcite reported a diamagnetic persistent current of average amplitude @xmath15 @xmath16 with half a flux - quantum periodicity . such @xmath5 oscillations with diamagnetic response were also found in other persistent current experiments consisting of ensemble of isolated rings  @xcite .",
    "measurements on single isolated mesoscopic rings on the other hand detected @xmath4-periodic persistent currents with amplitudes of the order of @xmath17 , ( closed to the value for an ordered ring ) . theory and experiment  @xcite",
    "seem to agree only when _",
    "disorder is weak_. in another recent nice experiment bluhm _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have measured the magnetic response of @xmath18 individual cold mesoscopic gold rings , one ring at a time , using a scanning squid technique .",
    "they have measured @xmath19 component and predicted that the measured current amplitude agrees quite well with theory  @xcite in a single ballistic ring  @xcite and an ensemble of @xmath20 nearly ballistic rings  @xcite . however , the amplitudes of the currents in single - isolated - diffusive gold rings  @xcite were two orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical estimates .",
    "this discrepancy initiated intense theoretical activity , and it is generally believed that the electron - electron correlation plays an important role in the disordered diffusive rings  @xcite .",
    "an explanation based on the perturbative calculation in presence of interaction and disorder has been proposed and it seems to give a quantitative estimate closer to the experimental results , but still it is less than the measured currents by an order of magnitude , and the interaction parameter used in the theory is not well understood physically .",
    "most of these theoretical results have been obtained based on a tight - binding framework within the _ nearest - neighbor hopping _ ( nnh ) approximation .",
    "this is an important approximation and it has been shown that within the nnh model electronic correlation provides a small enhancement of current amplitude in disordered materials i.e. , a weak delocalizing effect is observed in presence of electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction . as an attempt in the present work",
    "we modify the traditional nnh model by incorporating the effects of higher order hopping integrals , at least second - neighbor hopping ( snh ) , in addition to the nnh integral .",
    "it is also quite physical since electrons have some finite probabilities to hop from one site to other sites apart from nearest - neighbor with reduced strengths .",
    "we will show that the inclusion of higher order hopping integrals gives significant enhancement of current amplitude and it reaches quite closer to the current amplitude of ordered systems .",
    "the other important controversy comes for the determination of the sign of low - field currents and still it is an unresolved issue between theoretical and experimental results . in an experiment on persistent current levy _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown diamagnetic nature for the measured currents at low - field limit . while , in other experiment chandrasekhar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have obtained paramagnetic response near zero field limit .",

    "@xcite have predicted diamagnetic persistent current in their experiment and similar diamagnetic response in the vicinity of zero field limit were also supported in an experiment done by deblock  @xcite _ et al . _ on ag rings .",

    "though in a theoretical work cheung _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have predicted that the direction of current is random depending on the total number of electrons in the system and the specific realization of the random potentials .",
    "hence , prediction of the sign of low - field currents is still an open challenge and further studies on persistent current in mesoscopic systems are needed to remove the existing controversies .    in the present paper",
    "we address the behavior of persistent current in an interacting mesoscopic ring with finite width threaded by an aharonov - bohm flux @xmath0 .",
    "a simple tight - binding hamiltonian is used to illustrate the system and all the calculations are performed within a mean field approach . using a generalized hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation  @xcite , we compute numerically persistent current ( @xmath21 ) as functions of ab flux @xmath0 , total number of electrons @xmath22 , e - e interaction strength @xmath23 , second - neighbor hopping integral , disorder strength @xmath24 and system size @xmath25 . _",

    "it is observed that the ground state energy shows oscillatory behavior as a function of @xmath0 and the energy increases as the electronic correlation strength @xmath23 gets increased .",
    "most significantly we see that the ground state energy levels provide two    different types of periodicities depending on the electron filling . at quarter - filling",
    ", ground state energy level gives @xmath4 ( @xmath70 , since @xmath71 in our chosen unit system ) flux - quantum periodicity .",
    "on the other hand , at half - filling it shows @xmath5 flux - quantum periodicity .",
    "the situation becomes quite different when the total number of atomic sites @xmath25 in individual rings is even . for our illustrative purposes in fig .",
    "[ cylinderenergy2 ] we plot the lowest energy levels as a function of @xmath0 for some typical mesoscopic cylinders considering @xmath72 ( even @xmath25 ) .",
    "the curves of different colors correspond to the identical meaning as in fig .",
    "[ cylinderenergy1 ] . from the spectra given in figs .",
    "[ cylinderenergy2](a ) ( quarter - filled case ) and ( b ) ( half - filled case ) it is clearly observed that the ground state energy levels vary periodically with ab flux @xmath0 exhibiting only @xmath4 flux - quantum periodicity .",
    "thus it can be emphasized that the appearance of half flux - quantum periodicity strongly depends on the electron filling as well as on the oddness and evenness of the total number of atomic sites @xmath25 in individual rings . only for the half - filled cylinders with odd @xmath25",
    ", the lowest energy level gets @xmath5 periodicity with flux @xmath0 .",
    "now it is important to note that this half flux - quantum periodicity does not depend on the width ( @xmath26 ) of the cylinder and also it is independent of the hubbard correlation strength @xmath23 .",
    "hence , depending on the system size and filling of electrons variable periodicities are observed in the variation of lowest energy level .",
    "it may provide an important signature in studying magnetic response in nano - scale loop geometries .      in fig .",
    "[ cylindercurr ] we display the current - flux characteristics for some impurity free mesoscopic cylinders considering @xmath63 . in ( a ) the    results are given for the half - filled case where we set @xmath73 .",
    "the red line corresponds to the current for the non - interacting ( @xmath68 ) case , while the green and blue lines represent the currents when @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . from the curves we notice that the current amplitude gradually decreases with the increase of electronic correlation strength @xmath23",
    "the reason is that at half - filling each site is occupied by at least one electron of up spin or down spin , and the placing of a second electron of opposite spin needs more energy due to the repulsive effect of @xmath23 .",
    "thus conduction becomes difficult as it requires more energy when an electron hops from its own site and situates at the neighboring site .",
    "now both for the non - interacting and interacting cases , current shows half flux - quantum periodicity as a function a @xmath0 obeying the energy - flux characteristics since here we choose odd @xmath25 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the behavior of the persistent currents for even @xmath25 is shown in ( b ) where we set @xmath76 .",
    "the currents are drawn for the quarter - filled case i.e. , @xmath77 , where the red , green and blue curves correspond to @xmath68 , @xmath75 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the reduction of current amplitude with the increase of hubbard interaction strength is also observed for this quarter - filled case , similar to the case of half - filled as described earlier .",
    "but the point is that at quarter - filling , the reduction of current amplitude is much smaller compared to the half - filled situation .",
    "this is quite obvious in the sense that at less than half - filling ` empty ' lattice sites are available where electrons can hop easily without any cost of extra energy and the conduction becomes much easier than the half - filled situation . in this quarter - filled case ,",
    "persistent currents provide only @xmath4 flux - quantum periodicity following the @xmath79-@xmath0 diagram . from these current - flux characteristics",
    "it can be concluded that for _ ` ordered ' cylinders current amplitude always decreases with the enhancement in hubbard correlation strength @xmath23 . _      in order to describe the effect of impurities on electron transport now we focus our attention on the results of some typical disordered cylinders described with nnh integral .",
    "here we consider the diagonal disordered cylinders i.e. , impurities are introduced only at the site energies without disturbing the hopping integrals .",
    "the site energies in each concentric ring are chosen from a correlated distribution function which looks in the form , @xmath80 where , @xmath24 is the impurity strength .",
    "@xmath81 is an irrational number and we choose @xmath82 , for the sake of our illustration .",
    "setting @xmath83 , we get back the pure system with uniform site energy @xmath24 .",
    "now , instead of considering site energies from a correlated distribution function , as mentioned above in eq .",
    "[ equ7 ] , we can also take them randomly from a  box \" distribution function of width @xmath24 .",
    "but in the later case we have to take the average over a large number of disordered configurations ( from the stand point of statistical average ) and since it is really a difficult task in the aspect of numerical computation we select the other option . not only that in the averaging process several mesoscopic phenomena may disappear .",
    "therefore , the averaging process is an important issue in low - dimensional systems .    in presence of disorder ,",
    "energy levels get modified significantly . for our illustrative purposes in fig .",
    "[ cylinderenergy3 ] we plot ground state energy levels as a function of magnetic flux @xmath0 for some disordered mesoscopic cylinders when they are half - filled .",
    "the hubbard interaction strength @xmath23 is set at @xmath27 and the impurity strength @xmath24 is fixed to @xmath75 . in ( a ) the ground state energy level is shown for a cylinder with @xmath84 ( odd ) , while in ( b ) it is presented for a cylinder taking @xmath72 ( even ) .",
    "quite interestingly we see that for the cylinder with odd @xmath25 , the half flux - quantum periodicity of the lowest energy level disappears in the presence of impurity and it provides conventional @xmath4 periodicity .",
    "hence , for cylinders with odd @xmath25 , @xmath5 flux - quantum periodicity will be observed only when they are free from any impurity . for the disordered cylinder with even @xmath25 ( @xmath72 ) ,",
    "the lowest energy level as usual provides @xmath4 periodicity similar to the impurity free cylinders containing even @xmath25 . apart from this periodic nature",
    ", impurities play another significant role in the determination of the slope of the    energy levels .",
    "the slope of the lowest energy level decreases significantly compared to the perfect case , and therefore , a prominent change in current amplitude also takes place .    to justify the above facts , in fig .",
    "[ cylindercurr1 ] we present the variations of persistent currents with ab flux @xmath0 for a half - filled mesoscopic cylinder , described in the framework of nnh model , considering @xmath73 and @xmath63 .",
    "the red curve represents the current for the ordered ( @xmath85 ) non - interacting ( @xmath68 ) cylinder .",
    "it shows saw - tooth like nature with flux @xmath0 providing @xmath5 flux - quantum periodicity .",
    "the situation becomes completely different when impurities are introduced in the cylinder as seen by the other two curves .",
    "the green curve represents the current for the case only when impurities are considered but the effect of electronic correlation is not taken into account .",
    "it shows a continuous like nature with @xmath4 flux - quantum periodicity .",
    "the most important observation is that the current amplitude gets reduced enormously , even an order of magnitude , compared to the perfect cylinder .",
    "this is due to the localization of the energy eigenstates in the presence of impurity , which is the so - called anderson localization .",
    "hence , a large difference exists in the current amplitudes of an ordered and disordered non - interacting cylinders and it was the main controversial issue among the theoretical and experimental predictions .",
    "experimental verifications suggest that the measured current amplitude is quite comparable to the theoretical current amplitude obtained in a perfect system . to remove this controversy , as a first attempt",
    ", we include the effect of e - e correlation in the disordered cylinder described by the nnh model .",
    "the result is shown by the blue curve where @xmath23 is fixed at @xmath86 .",
    "it is observed that the current amplitude gets increased compared to the non - interacting disordered cylinder , though the increment is too small .",
    "not only that the enhancement can take place only for small values of @xmath23 , while for large enough @xmath23 the current amplitude rather decreases .",
    "this phenomenon can be implemented as follows .    for the non - interacting disordered cylinder",
    "the probability of getting two opposite spin electrons becomes higher at the atomic sites where the site energies are lower than the other sites since the electrons get pinned at the lower site energies to minimize the ground state energy , and this pinning of electrons becomes increased with the rise of impurity strength @xmath24 . as a result",
    "the mobility of electrons and hence the current amplitude gets reduced with the increase of impurity strength @xmath24 .",
    "now , if we introduce electronic correlation in the system then it tries to depin two opposite spin electrons those are situated together due to the coulomb repulsion .",
    "therefore , the electronic mobility is enhanced which provides larger current amplitude .",
    "but , for large enough interaction strength , no electron can able to hop from one site to other at the half - filling since then each site is occupied either by an up or down spin electron which does not allow other electron of opposite spin due to the repulsive term @xmath23 .",
    "accordingly , the current amplitude gradually decreases with @xmath23 .",
    "on the other hand , at less than half - filling though there is some finite probability to hop an electron from one site to the other available ` empty ' site but still it is very small .",
    "so , in brief , we can say that within the nearest - neighbor hopping ( nnh ) approximation electron - electron interaction does not provide any significant contribution to enhance the current amplitude , and hence the controversy regarding the current amplitude still persists .      to overcome the existing situation regarding the current amplitude , in this sub - section",
    ", finally we make an attempt by incorporating the effect of second - neighbor hopping ( snh ) integral in addition to the nearest - neighbor hopping ( nnh ) integral .",
    "a significant change in current amplitude takes place when we include the contribution of second - neighbor hopping ( snh ) integral in addition to the nnh integral . as representative examples , in fig .",
    "[ cylindercurr2 ] we plot the current - flux characteristics for a half - filled mesoscopic cylinder considering @xmath73 and @xmath63 .",
    "the black ,    magenta and gold lines correspond to the results in the presence of snh integral , while the other three colored curves ( red , green and blue ) represent the currents in the absence of snh integral . here we choose @xmath87 .",
    "the black curve refers to the persistent current for the perfect ( @xmath85 ) non - interacting ( @xmath68 ) cylinder and it achieves much higher amplitude compared to the nnh model ( red curve ) .",
    "this additional contribution comes from the snh integral since it allows electrons to hop further .",
    "in addition it is also noticed that the current varies periodically with @xmath0 providing @xmath4 flux - quantum periodicity , instead of @xmath5 as in the case of nnh integral model ( red curve ) .",
    "thus , it can be emphasized that @xmath5 periodicity will be observed only when the cylinder is ( a ) free from impurity , ( b ) half - filled , ( c ) made with odd @xmath25 , and ( d ) described by the nearest - neighbor hopping model .",
    "the main focus of this sub - section is to interpret the combined effect of snh integral and electron - electron correlation on the enhancement of persistent current amplitude in disordered cylinder . to do this",
    "first we narrate the effect of snh integral in disordered non - interacting cylinder .",
    "the nature of the current for this particular case is shown by the magenta curve of fig .",
    "[ cylindercurr2 ] .",
    "it shows that the current amplitude gets reduced compared to the perfect case ( black line ) , which is expected , but the reduction of the current amplitude is quite small than the nnh integral model .",
    "this is due the fact that the snh integral tries to delocalize the electronic    states , and therefore , the mobility of the electrons is enriched .",
    "the situation becomes more interesting when we include the effect of hubbard interaction .",
    "the behavior of the current in the presence of interaction is plotted by the gold curve of fig .",
    "[ cylindercurr2 ] where we fix @xmath74 .",
    "very interestingly we see that the current amplitude is enhanced significantly and quite comparable to that of the perfect cylinder .    for better clarity of the results discussed above , in fig .",
    "[ cylindercurr3 ] we also present the similar feature of persistent current for other hopping strength of snh integral . here",
    "we set @xmath88 . from these curves",
    "we see that the current amplitude gets enhanced more as we increase the snh strength .",
    "thus , it can be predicted that the presence of snh integral and hubbard interaction can provide a persistent current which may be comparable to the measured current amplitudes . in this presentation",
    "we consider the effect of only snh integral as a higher order hopping integral in addition to the nnh model , and , illustrate how such a higher order hopping integral leads an important role on the enhancement of current amplitude in presence of hubbard correlation for disordered cylinders .",
    "instead of considering only the snh integral we can also take the contributions from all possible higher order hopping integrals with reduced hopping strengths .",
    "since the strengths of other higher order hopping integrals are too small , the contributions from these factors are reasonably small and they will not provide any significant change in the current amplitude . finally , we can say that further studies are needed by incorporating all these factors .",
    "to summarize , in the present work we have addressed the behavior of persistent current in an interacting mesoscopic cylinder threaded by an aharonov - bohm flux @xmath0 .",
    "we have adopted a tight - binding hamiltonian to describe the model quantum system and all the numerical calculations have been done within a mean field approximation . using the generalized hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , we have computed persistent current as functions of snh integral , impurity strength @xmath24 , ab flux @xmath0 , electron filling @xmath89 and system size @xmath25 .",
    "our numerical results have provided several interesting features and the present study may be helpful in understanding magnetic response in nano - scale loop geometries .",
    "the essential features observed from our analysis are as follows .",
    "+ ( i ) in the determination of the lowest energy level we see that the energy level varies periodically with @xmath0 exhibiting both @xmath5 and @xmath4 flux - quantum periodicities depending on the choices of the parameters describing the tight - binding hamiltonian . + ( ii ) in the nnh model , current amplitude gets significantly reduced when impurities are introduced in the system . with the inclusion of hubbard interaction ( @xmath23 ) ,",
    "the current amplitude can be enhanced , though the enhancement becomes too small compared to the experimental verifications .",
    "+ ( iii ) a significant change in the current amplitude takes place when the effect of snh integral is taken into account . the combined effect of snh and hubbard interaction",
    "can provide the current which is quite comparable to the experimental realizations .",
    "so in short we can say that the conventional nnh model can be modified by incorporating the higher order hopping integrals .    throughout the analysis we have kept the width of the cylinders at a fixed value ( @xmath63 ) , for the sake of our illustration .",
    "all these results are also valid for cylinders of larger widths . here",
    "we have considered several important approximations by ignoring the effects of temperature , electron - phonon interaction , etc . due to these factors ,",
    "any scattering process that appears in the cylinder would have influence on electronic phases . at the end , we would like to say that we need further study in such systems by incorporating all these effects .",
