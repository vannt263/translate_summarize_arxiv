    "invasion fitness is a criterion which allows to determine if a mutant population can invade a resident one .",
    "the definition of the invasion fitness depends on the model under consideration @xcite : usually for deterministic models , it is the asymptotic growth rate of the population , for stochastic models it is the survival probability of the mutant population @xcite .    here , we propose a general numerical approach to study the invasion capacity of a mutant population and to determine the evolutionary singular strategies when the competitive exclusion principle holds .",
    "the method is applied to a mass - structured chemostat model .",
    "first developed by @xcite and @xcite , the chemostat is a culture method for maintaining a bacterial ecosystem in continuous growth .",
    "adaptive dynamics in chemostat were studied for unstructured models in a deterministic context by @xcite and in a stochastic context by @xcite .",
    "the choice between stochastic and deterministic models usually depends on the context of the study : the latter for homogeneous large size populations , the former for small size populations where randomness can not be neglected @xcite .",
    "the numerical inference of adaptive dynamics for deterministic models is straightforward compared to that of stochastic models .",
    "for example , for the stochastic mass - structured chemostat model , the invasion fitness is defined as the survival probability which is the solution of a functional equation .",
    "the mutant population can invade the resident one if and only if this survival probability is strictly positive .",
    "it is usually difficult to decide whether a numerical approximation of a survival probability is different from zero or not . for the corresponding deterministic model",
    ", the mutant population dynamics can be modeled as a population balance equation @xcite , and the feasibility of invasion depends on the sign of the principal eigenvalue of the operator associated to this equation .",
    "the latter approach is more straightforward to apply , compared to evaluating the positiveness of the survival probability .",
    "@xcite established a mathematical link between the two invasion fitnesses for mass - structured growth - fragmentation - death models , that link considerably simplifies the numerical analysis of the stochastic version .    in this article , we focus on mutations which affect the division mechanism of a bacterial population ; mutations can affect the mean proportion of the smallest daughter cell during the division and/or the minimal mass required for bacterial division .",
    "we apply an evolutionary analysis to determine the best cytokinesis strategy that the population should adopt in terms of mass division .",
    "the optimal division strategy has been previously studied by @xcite , in a deterministic context without interactions between bacteria ( through the substrate in our model ) and for strategies focusing only on the proportion of division .    in section  [ sec.model ]",

    "we present two definitions of the invasion fitness : the principal eigenvalue of a growth - fragmentation - death operator in the deterministic case , and the survival probability of the mutant population in the stochastic case .",

    "this section details a numerical approach , based on @xcite and @xcite , which allows one to analyze evolutionary dynamics in a relatively complex chemostat model .",
    "our approach is based on the following models that we will detail in this section :    * * ibm : individual - based model of resident and mutant populations .",
    "* this is the full chemostat model in which both resident and mutant populations are described by a stochastic individual - based model . * * pde : deterministic approximation of the ibm .",
    "* under a rare mutation assumption , between mutation times , the populations follow a system of integro - differential equations .",
    "this model is useful when populations are large , which is however not the case for the mutant population at a mutation time .",
    "a challenge associated with this model is to determine when a mutation occurs as the mutations are supposed to be rare . * *",
    "r - ibm : reduced individual - based model for the mutant population .",
    "* the resident population is assumed to stay at its stationary state , whereas the mutant population is described by an individual - based model .",
    "this model is realistic if the mutations are sufficiently rare in order for the resident population to reach its stationary state before the mutation and as long as the mutant population remains sufficiently small to have a neglectable effect on the stationary state of the resident population . * * r - pde : reduced deterministic model for the mutant population .",
    "* this model is a deterministic approximation of the r - ibm model : the resident population is assumed to stay at its stationary state and the mutant population evolves according to an integro - differential equation .",
    "this model may appear to be unrealistic due to opposing assumptions : the deterministic approximation is valid in large populations while the reduced model ( constant resident population ) is valid for a small mutant population .",
    "however , this model will prove to be very useful in the numerical study .",
    "we are interested to study numerically the evolution of a mass - structured population in a chemostat .",
    "we suppose that individuals grow by consuming a resource and divide after reaching a sufficiently large size .",
    "individuals are also removed from the system due to the output flow of the chemostat .",
    "we also assume that during the division , mutations can appear in a gene that affects the minimal mass for division @xmath0 and/or the mean proportion @xmath1 of the smallest daughter bacteria after division .",

    "the model was originally introduced by @xcite and @xcite . in this model ,",
    "each individual is characterized by its trait @xmath3 and its mass @xmath4 .",
    "the model consists of the following stochastic events .    1 .",

    "the model described above is a stochastic individual - based model ( ibm ) and a markov process . to convert this model into a deterministic representation , we consider the above transition rates as the time - derivatives of partial differential equation ( pde ) .",
    "what is however challenging is to derive a description of the mutation times as in a purely deterministic pde model they can not be modeled as random events .    the pde approximation can be expected to be valid for large size populations , but a poor approximation for small sized ones , which is the very situation of the mutant population shortly after a mutation .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "we suppose that the growth function is a modified gompertz one , where the growth rate depends on the substrate concentration and follows a monod law at the level of the individual , namely : @xmath28 with @xmath29^a\\,x^d\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the maximal size of the bacteria .",

    "if the mutations are rare enough , we can assume that the chemostat reaches a neighborhood of its stationary state @xmath70 before a mutation occurrence , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the substrate concentration and the mass density at the equilibrium when the chemostat evolves with only one population with trait @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the population with trait @xmath73 will be named the resident population .",
    "just after a mutation , the size of the mutant population , with trait @xmath74 , is negligible with respect to the size of the resident one .",

    "as the mutations are assumed to be rare , secondary mutations can be neglected during the invasion attempt of a primary mutant .",

    "two cases are possible when a mutation occurs :    * * 1st case :* the resident population is `` better '' than the mutant population , in the sense that the resident population has a better fitness / growth that the mutant one .",
    "hence the mutant population goes extinct . * * 2nd case :* the mutant population is `` better '' than the resident population , hence the mutant population may invade the resident one . in this case , there are two possibilities : * * the mutant population goes extinct even though the equilibrium @xmath70 is in favor of the invasion of the mutant population ; * * the mutant population invades the resident population and , as soon as the two populations are large enough , the dynamics of the chemostat can then be approached by the following system ( pde after the mutation time ) : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are respectively the densities of the resident and the mutant populations at time @xmath21 .",

    "the first is a stochastic individual - based model ( r - ibm ) and the second is a deterministic integro - differential model ( r - pde ) .",
    "when a mutant population appears in the chemostat , it is in small population size , and thus submitted to a non - neglectable randomness that can be captured by a stochastic model only . in particular , the probability that the mutant goes extinct is non - neglectable although the environment is in favor of its invasion . however , the stochastic representation is more complex to study numerically and analytically than the deterministic integro - differential model .",
    "the mathematical link between these two representations ( see section [ links.between.fitness ] ) , established by @xcite , allows one to use the deterministic model to study invasion criteria for the stochastic model .",

    ", the invasion fitness can be defined as the survival ( or invasion ) probability of the mutant population described by the reduced model .",

    "thus , making the link between these two invasion fitnesses is very useful in determining when a mutant population can invade a resident one for the stochastic model . @xcite",
    "made this link in the following sense : @xmath98 thus , the invasion criteria in the stochastic and deterministic models are in this sense equivalent .",
    "however , the eigenvalue @xmath83 does not depend on the initial mass @xmath4 whereas the invasion probability @xmath90 does depend on it .",
    "contrary to the full chemostat model , in which individuals indirectly interact through the substrate consumption , there is no interaction between individuals in the reduced models .",
    "the stochastic reduced model is then a branching process .",
    "this is the key argument in making the link between the stochastic and the deterministic reduced models @xcite .",
    "we now describe the numerical methods that we will use in section  [ sec.numeric ] where we examine numerically the links between the model variants . for many of these methods ,",

    "in this article , we have proposed an approach to study mutations affecting the cell division in a limited and controlled environment such as the chemostat . our objective was to determine in which circumstances a mutant population could replace a resident one .",
    "the main difficulty is to determine the suitable modeling approach to describe the problem .",
    "stochastic representations are required to model a population in small size , which is the case at the very moment of the appearance of a mutant strain .",
    "in contrast with deterministic representations , stochastic representations allow for an explicit derivation of the extinction probability of the mutant population at its appearance . however , stochastic representations are less straightforward to compute and analyze than their deterministic counterparts .",
    "moreover , deterministic models , generally understood in a biological context as an asymptotic limit in large population size of a stochastic model , are essential objects in order to apprehend the stochastic models .",
    "we have proposed a model reduction technique that takes advantage of both stochastic and deterministic approaches : with the help of a previously published mathematical result , one can characterize the mutant strains that can invade a resident population according to the stochastic model by simulating the deterministic model .    using the previously described reduced model ,",
    "we have represented the mutual invasion possibilities with respect to the mutant and the resident traits through a pairwise invasibility plot ( pip ) .",
    "this plot has permitted us to determine an evolutionary singular strategy ( ess ) .",
    "this strategy achieves the best substrate degradation , that is the minimal substrate concentration in the chemostat at the stationary state obtained by adjusting the evolutionary trait .",
    "this trait will then characterize the `` best '' population growth . following the argument of substrate concentration at the stationary state and using a mathematical result previously proved in @xcite",
    ", we have proposed a more efficient simulation method to determine the invasion possibilities .",
    "in fact , we have drawn the pip by computing , for each resident and mutant trait , first , the stationary state of the resident population and second , the growth rate of the mutant population in this stationary state . however , as illustrated in this article , it is sufficient to compare the substrate concentrations at the stationary state for both traits in order to determine if the mutant population is able to invade or not . nevertheless , information is lost with this method as we can obtain qualitative results , such as the `` shape '' of the pip , but no quantitative results , such as the value of the growth rate generally represented in this kind of plot .",
    "we also loose information on the stochastic model , and more precisely on the survival probability , when we use the deterministic model to represent the pip .",
    "a challenge for future work is to establish a relationship between the survival probability and the eigenvalue as for the birth - death process for which the survival probability is equal to @xmath175_+$ ] where @xmath176 where @xmath177 and @xmath34 are the birth and death rates .",
    "we now comment some assumptions we made in this study .",
    "first that the resident population is large and second , that the mutations are relatively rare . although these assumptions may be debatable , however , they allow one to determine the convergence - stable ess , which corresponds to the optimal trait of the population independently of these assumptions . moreover , they allow one to compare two different traits in order to determine which one is best able to degrade the substrate , while remaining independent of both assumptions .",
    "one other assumption made in this approach is that the deterministic equilibrium of the resident population is non trivial , i.e. that the population does not go extinct",
    ". it could be interesting to extend the study to more general models , for example for a non monotonic haldane growth rates @xmath178 , for which a mutant population can invade the chemostat but not starting from any initial conditions .",
    "the reduction technique proposed here on a chemostat example has the advantage to be generic and can be applied to other bacterial ecosystems or other population cell models .",
    "this technique is based first on the characterization of the deterministic model as the large population size limit of the stochastic model and , second , on the link between the definition of the invasion fitness for the deterministic models and the corresponding definition for the stochastic models .",
