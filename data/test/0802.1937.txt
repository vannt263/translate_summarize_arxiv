    "there has been an increasing interest in unparticle scenario which was introduced by georgi @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "new physics contains both standard model ( sm ) fields and a scale invariant sector described by banks - zaks ( bz ) fields @xcite .",
    "these two sector interact via the exchange of particles with a mass scale @xmath1 . below this large mass scale interactions between sm fields and bz fields are described by non - renormalizable couplings suppressed by powers of @xmath1 @xcite :    @xmath2    renormalization effects in the scale invariant bz sector then produce dimensional transmutation at an energy scale @xmath3 @xcite . in the effective theory below the scale @xmath3 ,",
    "the bz operators are embedded as unparticle operators .",
    "the operator ( 1 ) is now match onto the following form ,    @xmath4    here , @xmath5 is the scale dimension of the unparticle operator @xmath6 and the constant @xmath7 is a coefficient function .",
    "phenomenological implications of unparticles have been discussed in the literature @xcite . in some of these",
    "researches mentioned above several unparticle production processes have been studied .",
    "a possible evidence for this scale invariant sector might be a missing energy signature .",
    "it can be tested experimentally by examining missing energy distributions .",
    "another evidence for unparticles can be explored by studying its virtual effects . imposing scale invariance , unparticle propagators for spin-0 and spin-1 unparticles",
    "are given by @xcite :    @xmath8    respectively , where    @xmath9    in eq.(3 ) , @xmath10 in t or u - channel diagrams where @xmath11 is negative , @xmath12 in s - channel diagrams where @xmath11 is positive .",
    "interaction vertices for the scalar and vector unparticles with the sm fermions are given respectively , by    @xmath13    @xmath14    the top quark is the heaviest fermion in the standard model ( sm ) and its mass is at the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale .",
    "because of its large mass top quark couplings are expected to be more sensitive to new physics than other particles@xcite . therefore deviations from the sm expectations in top quark production processes would be a signal for the new physics .    in this work we analyzed vector and scalar unparticle effects on top quark spin correlations in pair production process @xmath15 .",
    "since the top quark is very heavy its weak decay time is much shorter than the typical time for the strong interaction to affect its spin@xcite .",
    "therefore top polarization information is not distributed by hadronization effects and transferred to the decay products .",
    "the angular distribution of the top quark decay involves correlations between top decay products and top quark spin :    @xmath16    here the dominant decay chain of the top quark in the standard model @xmath17 is considered .",
    "@xmath18 is the spin asymmetry and @xmath19 is defined as the angle between top quark decay products and the top quark spin quantization axis in the rest frame of the top quark .",
    "@xmath20 is the correlation coefficient and @xmath21 for @xmath22 or @xmath23 which leads to the strongest correlation .",
    "therefore top quark polarization can be determined by means of the angular distribution of its decay products .",
    "we take into account top quark spin and antitop quark spin polarizations along the direction of various spin bases .",
    "these spin bases are the helicity basis and the incoming beam directions . in the sm",
    "there is a spin asymmetry between the produced top - antitop pairs .",
    "more specifically , the number of produced top - antitop quark pairs with both spin up or spin down is different from the number of pairs with the opposite spin combinations .",
    "therefore , if the top quark is coupled to a new physics beyond the sm , the top - antitop quark spin correlations could be altered@xcite .",
    "the top - antitop correlations can be used to search new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the unparticle couplings are examples of such new physics .",
    "we consider the scalar and vector unparticle interaction terms which are given in eq.5,6 in addition to the sm contributions . in our calculations",
    "we assume that @xmath24 .",
    "the research and developments on linear @xmath25 colliders have been progressing and physics potential of these future machines is under study .",
    "linear @xmath25 collider can provide a very useful laboratory to study physics of the top quark .",
    "furthermore this linear colliders have a clean environment and the experimental clearness is an additional advantage of @xmath25 collisions with respect to hadron collisions .",
    "since top quark possesses a large mass its helicity is frame dependent and changes under a boost from one frame to another . the helicity and chirality states",
    "do not coincide with each other and there is no reason to believe that the helicity basis will give the best description of the spin of top quarks .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to study other spin bases for top quark .",
    "top quark spinors are eigenstates of the operator @xmath26 :    @xmath27u(p_{t},\\pm s)=\\pm u(p_{t},\\pm s)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where spin four vector of a top quark is defined by    @xmath28    here @xmath29 in the top quark rest frame .    in the presence of unparticles , @xmath30 process",
    "occur via s - channel exchange of unparticles and usual electroweak bosons , @xmath31 and z. during amplitude calculations one can project the top quark and antitop quark spin to a given spin direction .",
    "we consider incoming beam directions and helicity basis . in the top quark rest frame ( or in antitop",
    "quark rest frame),its spin direction along any beam can be defined as ,    @xmath32    where , @xmath33 is the particle momentum ( positron or electron ) , observed in the rest frame of the top quark .",
    "it is possible to analyze the top and antitop quark spin correlations via angular correlations of two charged leptons @xmath34 produced by the top - antitop quark leptonic decay channels .",
    "we consider the leptonic decay channels of the top pairs .",
    "after integration over azimuthal angles the correlation is given by @xcite ,    @xmath35    here @xmath36 represents the cross section for the process of the leptonic decay modes , @xmath37 represents the angle between the top ( antitop ) spin axis and the direction of motion of the anti - lepton ( lepton ) in the top ( antitop ) rest frame .",
    "the _ a _ coefficient stands for the spin asymmetry between top and antitop pairs and defined as ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the cross section of pair top quark production process .    in table",
    "[ tab1]-[tab2 ] spin asymmetries are given for various spin bases .",
    "one can see from table [ tab1 ] , sm spin asymmetry is @xmath40 for @xmath41=0.5 tev when top spin and antitop quark spin are in the helicity basis . in unparticle scheme , there are new contributions to pair production process .",
    "we calculated spin dependent squared amplitudes including scalar and vector unparticle mediated process . in the scalar unparticle exchange case ,",
    "spin asymmetry increases and it takes a positive value , @xmath42 . when we consider vector unparticle exchange , asymmetry takes a negative value , @xmath43 .",
    "it is seen from the tables that maximum deviation from the sm one occurs in the scalar unparticle case . on the other hand ,",
    "another useful basis is the incoming beam directions , in which the top quark spin axis is along the positron beam direction in the top rest frame , and antitop quark spin axis is along the electron direction in the antitop rest frame . in this basis",
    ", sm asymmetry is @xmath44 for @xmath41=0.5 tev . in scalar unparticle exchange , @xmath45 increases and takes a positive value , @xmath46 . in vector unparticle exchange spin",
    "asymmetry is , @xmath47 .",
    "it is shown that maximum deviation from the sm observed in the scalar unparticle exchange for the helicity basis . at the tables we considered that @xmath48 and @xmath49 tev .",
    "the influence of the center of the mass energy on the spin asymmetry is shown in fig.[fig1]-[fig4 ] . in fig.[fig1 ] we consider the scalar unparticle and helicity basis for top - antitop quark spin .",
    "we see from this figure that a sizeable deviation from the sm one occurs at @xmath48 . in fig.[fig2 ]",
    "we take into account vector unparticle effects .",
    "one can see that unparticle contributions leads to a little deviation from the sm at each center of mass energy .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] shows similar behavior with fig.[fig1 ] but for the top spin axis is along the incoming positron beam direction and antitop spin axis is along the incoming electron beam direction . in fig.[fig4 ] vector unparticle effects are shown for the same basis with fig.[fig3 ] . in this figure maximum deviation",
    "can be seen at @xmath48 .    in fig.[fig5 ]",
    "the spin asymmetries as a function of the scale dimension @xmath5 are given .",
    "we consider helicity direction in this figure and it can be seen that scalar unparticle contribution leads to a considerable deviation from the sm . on the other hand , vector unparticle contribution leads to a little deviation . at growing values of @xmath5 sm , scalar and vector unparticle",
    "asymmetries close up .",
    "fig.[fig6 ] has similar behavior with fig.[fig5 ] but in this figure top - antitop spin is along the incoming beam directions .    in our calculations phase space integrations have been performed by grace @xcite which uses a monte carlo routine .",
    "in this paper we have studied the top spin correlations with the unparticle effects in @xmath25 collision .",
    "we calculate spin dependent cross sections to obtain top and antitop spin asymmetry .",
    "it is shown that existence of scalar or vector unparticle leads to a significant deviation of the spin asymmetry from the its sm value .",
    "variations of the spin asymmetry are reflected by the angular distribution of the top and antitop decay products .",
    "therefore spin correlations provide us useful information to test the new physics beyond the sm .",
