    "the neutrino are very complex particles indeed .",
    "their three light neutrino flavors mix in a complex way described by a matrix born only in last few decades @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "their presence maybe recorded in small kiloton detector or larger ( like sk and super kamiokande @xmath11 kiloton ) ones.in largest size detectors as icecube the higher characteristic @xmath1 , @xmath2 tev energy do not oscillate much and they do not exhibit the negligible oscillation along our narrow earth .",
    "however the new born deep core , while tuning to few tens or even a few gev @xmath1 , @xmath2 energy , may hold memory of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 disappearance into tau .",
    "many have foreseen the @xmath1 , @xmath2 disappearance in deep core @xcite@xcite .",
    "we did use their prediction to calibrate the eventual cpt violation influence into their future rate @xcite . here",
    "we review these predictions and now we reconsider our preliminary estimate , based on super kamiokande ones @xcite , estimates that partially disagree with the previous results @xcite@xcite@xciteas well as @xcite .",
    "deep core , is a new telescope or better a counter event blurred at low energies ( below @xmath12 gev ) because muons are tracing tracks mostly projected along one string : the inner cone within @xmath13 may contain any neutrino arrival direction around the string axis azimuth angle . at higher energy @xmath14 gev the muon track , if inclined , may intersect two different strings leading to a much accurate ( a few degree ) angular resolution .",
    "therefore the deepcore may test different energy regions at different degree of resolution .",
    "moreover most of the very inclined ( respect the vertical ) muons ( below @xmath12 gev ) may intersect briefly the one string leading to a few ( four - five ) detector optical module ( dom ) signal , in a very short timing clustering .",
    "this mean that most of the inclined events may accumulate , as a noise , into the a few channel region that is at the same time the deposit of ten ( or tens ) gev shower , mostly neutral current , ( nc ) , event by @xmath1 , @xmath2,@xmath3 , @xmath4 and charged current , ( cc ) , and nc due to electrons by @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "these few channel signals may also record rare ( nearly a thousand ) tau appearance .",
    "however the previous noise will make difficult to discover tau appearance , while muon disappearance is still viable .      the simplest way to estimate",
    "the deep core muon track and possible tau appearance ( or better , the muon disappearance ) has been shown by icecube mc simulation @xcite , as described in figure [ 123 ] , with our additional cpt violation expected influence@xcite .",
    "however we show here an independent derivation of the expected deep core rate , based on superkamiokande one @xcite .",
    "there are four main contribute to sk upgoing muons : fully contained event ( fc ) , born inside and decayed inside sk ; partially contained event ( pc ) , born inside but escaping outside the sk volume ; the upward stopping muons , born outside but decayed inside the detector ; the upward through muon , just born outside , crossing and decaying again at external volume . some care",
    "have been taken into account for the last upward stopping muons and upward through muon : the sk location is deeply surrounded by mountain rock , while deep core is within much less dense ice .",
    "therefore we suppressed the two last rates by the density ratio ( @xmath17 ) to calibrate the expected rate in deepcore , amplified by extrapolated volume ratio ( @xmath18 ) versus deep core one at each energy range .",
    "indeed the deep core volume is variable with the muon energy values due to photodetector thresholds and muon cherenkov luminosity .",
    "we considered here the preliminary deep core effective volume variability following last icecube articles @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "our result is described in the right side of figure [ 123],[05 ] in linear scale along the channel number .",
    "we assumed an averaged neutrino muon and anti - muon energy conversion , their length projected along the string at spread angle of @xmath19 .",
    "the total event number derived by simplest sk - deepcore translation is huge : @xmath20 .",
    "most of these events are not vertical but inclined . therefore assuming a vertical beaming solid cone suppression ( also to reconcile with deep core total expected rate ) we selected only those events within a cone angle @xmath21 , obtaining a fraction ( @xmath22 ) of the total rate , in this way now compatible with deep core preliminary global expectation @xmath23 .",
    "the calibrated muon rate figure [ 05 ] shows in grouped channel graph number , the rate that we foresee following sk within a narrow vertical axis along each string .",
    "these prediction do not overlap with previous one .",
    "in particular as we did mention we foresee a huge rate of inclined events whose nc produce shower observable by @xmath24 channel : this very rough estimate is based on the nc , and electron cc , nc shower : they are well above @xmath25 nc ( for @xmath1 @xmath3 ) with additional thousands of shower by cc and nc for @xmath15 and their antiparticles .",
    "the inclined tracks by nearly horizontal muons will excite the vertical string with a characteristic arrival time much shorter than any vertical shower event .",
    "indeed the time difference in arrival for spherical shower along a string ( each dom at @xmath26 m separation ) is nearly @xmath27 ; by triangulation any horizontal muon tracks and its cherenkov cone will record a quite shorter delay @xmath28 .",
    "therefore this cluster of event , nearly coincident in time , might be a key test to calibrate the muon event rate in wide solid angle and possibly to meter the event rate at each channel .",
    "we did show the rate of atmospheric muon neutrinos along deep core string channels with some comments on the expected anisotropy .",
    "the main results are : a ) a very sharp peaked morphology in muon rate , namely a huge noise rate in low range @xmath29 channel ( ten thousand or above event a year ) followed by b ) , a deep minimum along channel @xmath30 due to muon disappearance ( contrasted partially by eventual cpt violation ) , whose rate maybe below @xmath31 event a year .",
    "c ) a global decay and suppression of described events fig ( [ 05 ] ) in range above @xmath32 , all along each channel , because of muon disappearance and additional anti - muon cpt violated suppression , by the vertical muon tracks that are more wide and they suffer larger disappearance leading to more anisotropic behavior respect to the averaged sk rates .",
    "the present rate estimate differ from the most known ones @xcite,10,20 ; however the cpt violation influence foreseen in our previous paper @xcite plays the same role : to reduce the common muon survival , making more anti - tau appearance , from channel above @xmath33 .",
    "the strong modulation by cpt violation at low channel ( @xmath29 ) number , is quite remarkable , but it is nevertheless useless because a huge noise pollution by nc , electron cc , nc and nearly horizontal muon traces .",
