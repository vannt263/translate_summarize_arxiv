    "the proximity of m87 ( @xmath2=16 mpc ; * ? ? ? * ) makes it one of the best systems to study relativistic jets at high linear resolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "our observations with the  x - ray observatory isolated short ( month ) timescale variability @xcite in a jet region previously dubbed ` hst-1 ' , which is separated by 0.86  ( 60 pc , projected ) from the central `` active '' supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "the variability culminated in a factor @xmath350 x - ray outburst making hst-1 the brightest x - ray source in the galaxy for a few years .",
    "figure  [ fig-2 ] shows a lightcurve from 2000 to the end of 2006 .",
    "observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( ) and the _ very large array _ ( ) show comparable activity in the optical and at radio frequencies @xcite .",
    "after the detection of appreciable radio flux in hst-1 from our first season of  observations ( in 2003 ) , we began to monitor the jet at higher ( sub - parsec ) resolution with the nrao _ very long baseline array _ ( ) at three frequencies ( 0.33 , 0.61 , and 1.7 ghz ) commencing in jan . 2005 .",
    "this was the period at which the x - ray and optical intensities were peaking , and the radio intensity plateaued ( fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ) . here",
    ", we report on the highest resolution ( 1.7 ghz ) observations which resolve dynamic structures within the flaring x - ray region , including the discovery of superluminal motion in multiple knots .",
    "the implications for observations of more distant @xmath0-ray emitting relativistic jets are discussed .",
    "each of our nine  runs consisted of six one - hour integrations of m87 over an 8 hr period , with calibrator observations interleaved .",
    "four adjacent 8 mhz bandwidth channels were used , centered at 1.667 ghz .",
    "the full 10 antenna array was used except in jan .",
    "2005 ( missing hancock antenna ) , may 2005 ( missing saint croix ) , and may 2006 ( missing pie town ) .",
    "the data were calibrated using nrao s  data calibration pipeline in aips and post - processed with a combination of difmap and aips .",
    "the rms noise in the  images are within 15@xmath4 of the theoretically predicted value for the full  ( 0.053 mjy / bm ) .",
    "the images have been restored with a common beam ( fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] ) which is within 10@xmath4 of the uniformly weighted beams of all but the may 2005 epoch .    over the inner jet ,",
    "the new sequence of  images shows previously known radio structure out to @xmath5250 mas from the core @xcite with additional transversely resolved emission between @xmath5200 - 450 mas ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "the central position angle ( pa@xmath5290 ) of the first @xmath5100 mas portion of the jet aligns roughly with the large - scale  jet .",
    "knot ` hst-1 ' is further downstream and is offset from the central jet being aligned with the projection of the northern edge of the resolved @xmath5200 - 450 mas jet ( i.e. , pa@xmath6294.5 ) .    a short 2.3 ghz  observation obtained in jul .",
    "2004 by the usno @xcite detected only the two brightest features in hst-1 seen in our early images allowing us to trace these structures back by @xmath51/2 year before our program commenced .",
    "further archival vlbi observations of varying quality as far back as in 2000 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) did not give any significant detections of hst-1 .",
    "we registered the images from the different epochs on the position of the maximum of the radio core ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) . based on the stability of the structure of the inner jet @xcite over the 10 total epochs of observations ,",
    "the core position is determined to be aligned to a fraction of the common beam over the two year period .    with the images registered , the upstream ( eastern ) edge which we call ` hst-1d ' , is the dominant feature in the hst-1 complex at the early epochs .",
    "the later epoch images reveal the emergence of a radio knot ( hst-1c ) moving downstream from hst-1d at a rate of 4.48@xmath70.42 mas / yr ( @xmath8 ) at a pa of 279  and the peak radio surface brightness decays by only @xmath520@xmath4 over a 1 year period . sometime between dec .",
    "2005 and feb .",
    "2006 , knot hst1c evidently splits into two roughly equally bright features : a faster moving component ( c1 ; 4.3@xmath70.7@xmath9 ) and a slower moving trailing feature ( c2 ; 0.47@xmath70.39@xmath9 ) . between the two years ,",
    "the location of hst-1d is basically stationary to within @xmath52 mas ( i.e. , its motion is @xmath100.25@xmath9 ) at 860 mas from the core and is the apparent point of origin of the superluminal ejections .",
    "the most distant knot ( hst-1a ) is well - isolated from the other structures in every observation .",
    "we observe it moving downstream at 2.49@xmath70.25@xmath9 at pa = 295@xmath78  ( basically radial ) until dec .",
    "2005 when it appears to decelerate to 1.41@xmath70.49@xmath9 at a smaller pa of 289(although the pa change is apparent in figure  [ fig-4 ] , it is not statistically significant ) . a fainter feature ( hst-1b ) , identifiable beginning 2005 , trails hst-1a at an identical speed ( 2.52@xmath70.14@xmath9 ) with a non - radial trajectory ( a smaller pa of 279@xmath76 ) .",
    "feature c1 ( see above ) actually ends up in jul .",
    "2006 where hst-1b was first detected in jan . 2005 .",
    "previous reports of motions up to @xmath56c from hst-1 were based on yearly  optical monitoring @xcite from 1994 to 1998 but pertained to emission further downstream from the  structures discussed here . furthermore , our motions are apparent on month timescales rather than years because of the higher spatial resolution of our  data .",
    "the extent of the radio emission in hst-1 is only @xmath540 mas , roughly 3 pixels across in the @xcite  foc images ; a  acis pixel is @xmath530@xmath11 larger .",
    "the importance of the superluminal motions reported here is twofold .",
    "first and foremost , the hst-1 complex is well - isolated from the nucleus and the rest of the jet , so the outbursting higher - energy ( x - ray , optical ) emission isolated by  and  can be uniquely attributed to the region resolved by our  observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) . while vlbi detections of superluminal motions are now commonplace in more distant relativistic jet sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the physical link to the higher - energy activity has not been possible previously because of the lack of comparably high spatial resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "second , contrary to conventional wisdom , this ` blazar'-like activity is clearly displaced from the central engine by @xmath1120 pc ( deprojected ; see   [ section-3.2 ] ) .",
    "thus , at least in the case of m87 , the observed hallmarks of blazar behavior are not directly associated with the immediate vicinity of the smbh where the jet is launched @xcite . without the comparably high linear resolution ,",
    "an analogous sequence of events in a more distant source would be associated with the base ( i.e. , sub - pc to few - pc scales ) of the jet where the ` non - jetted ' contribution from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) to the observed x - rays ( such as from the accretion disk ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would contaminate the lightcurves .      at even higher - energies , the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration recently reported flaring tev emission from m87 @xcite .",
    "this emission revealed gradual ( year timescale ) variability , with a maximum coinciding with the peak of the radio - to - x - ray activity detailed in hst-1 ( mid-2005 ; fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ) suggesting a link between these flares .",
    "however , the hst-1 knot was dismissed as a possible production site of the tev emission @xcite because of the short ( days ) timescale tev variability detected on top of the longer timescale variability .",
    "such rapid variations were considered unlikely for hst-1 since they imply ( through the causality argument ) an emission region size , where @xmath12 is the bulk lorentz factor , and @xmath13 is the angle to the line of sight . ] @xmath14pc .",
    "we can neither claim nor reject the presence of @xmath5day time - scale variability in our optical or x - ray data for hst-1 due to insufficient sampling .",
    "however , the data show the compact knots in hst-1 to be essentially unresolved with semi - minor axes @xmath100.15 pc , and the current optical / x - ray variability data constrain @xmath15pc ( see below ) , approaching the size limits set by the variability of the tev emission .    here , we suggest hst-1 as a plausible site for the production of a dominant portion of the detected vhe tev emission due to inevitable inverse - compton upscattering off ambient photon fields ( e.g. , starlight ) by the electrons producing the flaring synchrotron optical - to - x - ray emission .",
    "this was in fact proposed by @xcite in discussing earlier ( 2004 and before ) tev detections of m87 .",
    "the connection is strengthened by the fact that the maxima of the total tev flux density from m87 and synchrotron ( hst-1 only ) flares observed in 2005 were coincident , and that their luminosities are comparable ( fig .  [ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the @xmath16tev emission from m87 at this time is well described by a single power - law with spectral index @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , while the optical - to - x - ray power - law slope of hst-1 during the same period is similar : @xmath19 .",
    "these observations are consistent with a common origin for the flaring radio through @xmath0-ray emission from hst-1 as outlined in more detail in @xcite .    the above conclusion is supported by the lack of any other plausible production site for the vhe @xmath0-ray emission in m87 .",
    "for example ,",
    "the innermost ( sub - pc scale ) jet region is characterized by only small - amplitude optical / x - ray variability @xcite and only mildly relativistic radio features @xcite . as argued also by @xcite ,",
    "this is inconsistent with models for the generation of vhe emission in the unresolved core @xcite .",
    "instead , @xcite considered curvature radiation of ultra - high energy protons @xcite accelerated by a strong magnetic field in the closest vicinity ( @xmath20 ) of the smbh at the center of m87 . however , this interpretation is problematic also due to the fact that the nearest environments of active smbhs are expected to be opaque to tev photons due to photon - photon ( @xmath21 ) annihilation on ambient photon fields such as from the accretion disk .    in m87 , the @xmath0-ray photons in the energy range covered by h.e.s.s .",
    "( @xmath22 tev ) interact mostly with photons emitting at @xmath23hz , i.e. , infrared to optical ones .",
    "quantitatively , the optical depth for the @xmath21 annihilation process can be approximated by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "the number density @xmath26 of the @xmath27 nuclear photons within a spherical volume around the smbh of radius @xmath28 is related to the monochromatic luminosity @xmath29 by @xmath30 ( the main contributor to the photon energy density is judged to be from the accretion disk ) .",
    "hence one can find , @xmath31 .",
    "the considered region would be transparent to the tev photons only if @xmath32 .",
    "however , at @xmath33 we expect @xmath34 , since the observed luminosity of the m87 nucleus @xcite at @xmath35hz is @xmath36ergs@xmath37 , consistent with adaf approximations of the accretion disk @xcite . with the central region of the agn",
    "excluded as a plausible site of the tev emission , the flaring hst-1 knot is the most probable point of origin .",
    "therefore , in addition to the flaring synchrotron ( radio - to - x - ray ) emission , the superluminal radio structures detailed here can also be associated with vhe @xmath0-ray activity .",
    "a natural question to ask is if the position of the hst-1 knot in the m87 jet is ` special ' in some way .",
    "in other words , what determines the location and flaring behavior of this extremely compact and variable feature within the relativistic outflow ?",
    "the kinematics of the superluminal radio components ( in particular , the 4.3c motion in c1 ) constrain the jet at the location of hst-1 to be aligned at @xmath38 , and requires @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the hst-1 region is therefore @xmath1120 pc ( deprojected assuming @xmath41 ) . for a smbh with @xmath42 @xcite ,",
    "this corresponds to the distance of @xmath43 schwarzchild radii ( @xmath44 cm @xmath45pc ) .",
    "at such a large distance from the active center , our x - ray observations establish flux doubling timescales @xmath46 of 0.14 yrs @xcite , which constrains @xmath47pc .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the position of the hst-1 knot agrees with the expected location of a ` re - confinement nozzle ' formed within the m87 jet due to a converging shock driven by the interaction of the outflow with the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in this ambient medium",
    ", it was postulated that the gravitational influence of the central smbh in the inner region of the m87 host galaxy @xcite results in an increase of the gas pressure , analogous to the forming of the observed enhanced stellar cusp @xcite .",
    "for the temperature @xmath48kev of hot gaseous ism ( with the number density @xmath49@xmath50 ) in the inner ( @xmath51kpc ) parts of the galaxy , the gravitational capture radius is @xmath52pc , where @xmath53 is the appropriate sound speed @xcite .",
    "it turns out that @xmath54pc is the spatial scale of the disk of ionized gas observed in m87 by the  @xcite .",
    "it was the keplerian rotation of the inner parts of this disk which enabled a precise estimate of the black hole mass in this system @xcite .",
    "thus , one can surmise that a gravitationally perturbed ambient medium leads naturally to the formation of a jet feature like hst-1 at @xmath55pc from a central smbh . in this scenario ,",
    "the ` stationary ' region hst-1d defines the opening of the nozzle .",
    "the origins of the different superluminal features can be traced back to this position at @xmath52004.5 ( hst-1c ) , 2003.3 ( hst-1b ) , and 2001.9 ( hst-1a ) .",
    "the latter two could have originated more recently as they assume the nominal velocities of 2.5@xmath9 ; the apparent curve in trajectory and deceleration of hst-1a lead us to believe it could have been moving faster previous to our first imaging observations .    the formation of a ` reconfinement nozzle ' within the jet is not unique for the hydrodynamical outflow considered by @xcite .",
    "it was previously shown @xcite that interactions between a strongly magnetized relativistic outflow with a non - relativistic collimating magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) wind may lead as well to the formation of a converging shock within the relativistic component .",
    "an evaluation of the exact position of this shock from the jet base is extremely model - dependent .",
    "nevertheless , for the jet parameters anticipated by @xcite , who successfully explained the observed gradual collimation of the m87 jet between @xmath56 @xcite based on the @xcite mhd model , the expected position is near the location of the hst-1 knot .",
    "we speculate that a rapid release of the magnetic energy within the formed nozzle via magnetic reconnection may play an important role in producing the observed high energy flares and ejection of the relativistic radio blobs , somewhat analogous to coronal mass ejections from the sun @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have discovered superluminal motions of radio features in the m87 jet at a site remote from the central smbh .",
    "these features appear to be associated with the remarkable flare of 2005 for which the radio , optical , and x - ray flux densities peaked at levels of @xmath33050 times that of a few years earlier .",
    "we have argued that the tev excess intensity of 2005 detected from m87 by h.e.s.s .",
    "was a manifestation of the same event .",
    "thus , most of the defining characteristics of blazars have now been shown to occur at a distance @xmath1120 pc from the smbh instead of from the immediate environs of the central engine , as is commonly believed to be the case . as we enter the _ glast _ era , ensuing studies of high - energy flares from blazars should consider such a production site as we have resolved in m87 .",
    "we thank bill junor for his involvement in the early stages of this project , roger blandford for discussions on the @xmath0-ray opacity , and al marscher and ken kellermann ( the referee ) for helpful comments on the manuscript .",
