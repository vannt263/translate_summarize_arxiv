    "the ising model @xcite has become a excellent tool to study other models of social application .",
    "therefore , following this line of reasoning the zaklan model had been proposed and studied recently using the equilibrium ising model on square lattices by zaklan et al .",
    "@xcite . lima @xcite , based on grinstein et al .",
    "@xcite , made a proposal to extend the current model ( zaklan s model ) to nonequilibrium systems , using nonequilibrium majority - vote model ( mvm ) @xcite in order to make zaklan s model more realistic , because tax evasion is nonequilibrium .",
    "our simulation is based on the well - known apollonian packing introducing apollonian networks @xcite . according to andrade et al .",
    "@xcite the ans are simultaneously scale - free @xcite , small - world @xcite , euclidean , space filling , and with matching graphs @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ans have social connections that are often similar to scale - free or small - world networks @xcite and have been studied e.g. for the ising model and a magnetic model @xcite .",
    "the ans here are defined and described in detail in the pioneering work by andrade et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite on ans , the ising and potts models do not present a phase transition .",
    "therefore , the ising model on this topology is not useful for the zaklan model , because it does not have a phase transitions on ans .",
    "therefore , our work is not only to show that the zaklan model works another a topology as the ans , but also to show that in some topologies the traditional equilibrium spin models , as the ising model , are not appropriate to study socio - economic models as the model proposed by zaklan et al @xcite .",
    "therefore , different from ising models , the nonequilibrium mvm model is presented here as an alternative model in the study of socio - economic zaklan model on ans .",
    "this similar behavior was also shown by sumour et al @xcite and lima and stauffer @xcite , where the ising model do not present a phase transition on directed babsi - albert networks and hypercubic lattices , respectively .",
    "thus , we present an alternative proposed in the study of social and economics models via nonequilibrium mvm and also showed that in this case the criterion of grinstein et al .",
    "@xcite is not applicable , i.e , on ans ising and mvm do not belong to the same universality class .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the zaklan model evolving with dynamics of mvm . in section 3",
    "we make an analysis of tax evasion dynamics with the zaklan model on ans , using mvm for their temporal evolution under different enforcement regimes ; we discuss the results obtained . in section 4",
    "we show that mvm also is capable to control the different levels of the tax evasion analysed in section 3 , as it was made by zaklan et al .",
    "@xcite using ising models .",
    "we use the enforcement mechanism cited above on ans and discuss the resulting tax evasion dynamics . finally in section 5",
    "we present our conclusions about the study of the zaklan model using mvm on ans .",
    "the zaklan model @xcite consists of agents located on a regular or irregular structure .",
    "each agent is represented by an individual spin @xmath2 , who can either be an honest tax payer @xmath3 or a cheater @xmath4 . initially everybody is assumed honest . in each",
    "iteration individuals can rethink their behaviour and have the opportunity to become the opposite type of agent they were in the previous period .",
    "each agent s environment may prefer tax evasion or reject it .",
    "the agent depends on two factors : first , the agent s environment exerts influence on the agent in the next period .",
    "second , people s decisions are partly autonomous , independent of their environment , this autonomous part is responsible for the emergence of tax evasion , because some initially honest tax payers decide to evade taxes and then exert influence on others to do so as well .",
    "tax evaders have the greatest influence to turn honest citizens into tax evaders if they constitute a majority in the respective neighbourhood . on the other hand ,",
    "if most people in the vicinity are honest , the respective individual is likely to become a tax payer if ( s)he was a tax evader before .",
    "the model also presents an enforcement mechanism that consists of two components : a probability of an efficient audit @xmath5 .",
    "if tax evasion is detected , the individual must remain honest for a number @xmath6 of periods to be specified .",
    "one iteration is one sweep through the entire lattice . the temporal evolution this model can be performed by using an equilibrium or , in the present work , by nonequilibrium dynamics .",
    "the apollonian networks contain @xmath7 nodes ( sites , agents , spins ) where @xmath8 is the generation number @xcite .",
    "our mvm dynamics contains a noise parameter @xmath9 . for the case of four neighbors and @xmath10 ,",
    "if three or four neighbors disagree with the central site , the center flips ; if one or none disagrees , the center does not flip ; if two agree and two disagree , it flips with probability 1/2 . if @xmath11 the center may disobey this majority rule .",
    "more precisely , in each time period the system evolves by a single spin - flip dynamics with a probability @xmath12 given by    @xmath13,\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the sign @xmath15 of @xmath16 if @xmath17 , @xmath18 if @xmath19 , and the summation runs over all @xmath20 nearest - neighbour sites @xmath21 of @xmath22 . in this model",
    "an agent assumes the value @xmath15 depending on the opinion of the majority of its neighbors .",
    "the noise parameter @xmath9 plays the role of the temperature in equilibrium systems and measures the probability of aligning @xmath22 antiparallel to the majority of its neighbors @xmath21 .",
    "]    in order to test if there is a phase transition in mvm models on ans , we measured the relaxation time @xmath23 as a funtion of the noise parameter @xmath9 , independent of our tax question .",
    "we start the system with all spins up and a number @xmath24 of spins equal to @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we determine the time @xmath23 after which the magnetisation @xmath27 has flipped its sign for the first time , and then take the median value of nine samples . as one can see in fig .",
    "1 , the relaxation time goes to infinity at some positive @xmath9 value near 0.18 , indicating a second order phase transtion .",
    "on contrast , the ising model on ans @xcite and directed ba networks has no phase transition and agrees with the modified arrhenius law for relaxation time @xcite . in order to improve earlier affirmation the magnetisation and susceptibility for @xmath28 , and @xmath29 sites and with @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 generation",
    "are plotted in fig . 2 @xcite .",
    ", ( square ) @xmath33 , ( star ) @xmath34 , ( triangle up ) @xmath35 , ( triangle down ) @xmath36 . the number after @xmath37 gives the generation number @xmath8.,title=\"fig : \" ] , ( square ) @xmath33 , ( star ) @xmath34 , ( triangle up ) @xmath35 , ( triangle down ) @xmath36 . the number after @xmath37 gives the generation number @xmath8.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to calculate the rate of tax evaders , we use    @xmath38}{n } , % \\end{center}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the total number and @xmath39 the honest number of agents .",
    "the tax evasion is calculated at every time step @xmath40 of system evolution ; one time step is one sweep through the entire network .    here , we follow the same steps we did in a previous work @xcite . therefore , we first will present the baseline case @xmath41 and @xmath42 , i.e. , no use of enforcement , at @xmath43 and with @xmath44 sites for ans .",
    "all simulation are performed over @xmath45 time steps , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . for very low noise",
    "the part of autonomous decisions almost completely disappears .",
    "the individuals then base their decision solely on what most of their neighbours do .",
    "a rising noise has the opposite effect .",
    "individuals then decide more autonomously .",
    "therefore , figure 3 was expanded to four examples , in order to show how much the results differ if one changes the random numbers .",
    "error bars can not describe this randomness properly .",
    "( for the later figures the error bars are visible from the fluctuations in time which show a band of fractions . )",
    "although everybody is honest initially , it is impossible to predict roughly which level of tax compliance will be reached at some time step in the future .    for mvm it is known that for @xmath46 , half of the people are honest and the other half cheat , while for @xmath47 either one opinion or the other opinion dominates . because of this behavior we set at fixed `` social temperature '' ( @xmath9 ) to some values slightly below @xmath0 , where the case that agents distribute in equal proportions onto the two alternatives is excluded .",
    "then having set the noise parameter @xmath9 close to @xmath48 on the ans , we vary the degrees of punishment ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) and audit probability rate ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) . therefore ,",
    "if tax evasion is detected by the enforcement mechanism @xmath5 , the period of punishment @xmath6 is triggered in order to control the tax evasion level .",
    "the punished individuals remain honest for a certain number @xmath6 of periods , as explained before in section 2 .     and with three different seed ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and the average over twenty different seeds ( d ) .",
    "we use @xmath43 on ans and perform all simulations over @xmath45 time steps , also in the later figures . ]",
    "figure 4 illustrates different simulation settings for ans , for each considered combination of degree of punishment ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) and audit probability ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) , where the tax evasion is plotted over @xmath45 time steps . both a rise in audit probability ( greater @xmath5 ) and a higher penalty ( greater @xmath6 ) work to flatten the time series of tax evasion and to shift the band of possible non - compliance values towards more compliance .",
    "however , the simulations show that even extreme enforcement measures ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) can not fully solve the problem of tax evasion .",
    ", @xmath57 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 and audit probability @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . ]    in fig .",
    "5 we plot tax evasion for ans , but now with @xmath58 , again for different enforcement @xmath6 and audit probability @xmath5 .",
    "now the fluctuations are much smaller since the network is nearly nine times larger . for case",
    "( a ) we plot the baseline case @xmath41 and @xmath59 , i.e. , no use of enforcement for ans and parameters as in fig .",
    "3 . the probable error for part ( c ) fluctuates near 0.0031 and is much smaller than the symbols ( circle ) .",
    "case ( b ) with @xmath60 shows already a strong reduction of tax evasion . in case ( c )",
    "we show the tax evasion level decreases , on ans , for a more realistic set of possible values degrees of punishment @xmath61 and audit probability @xmath62 @xcite . in case ( d ) we also show the tax evasion level decreases much more for an extreme set of punishment @xmath56 and audit probability @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "therefore , our model also works for large networks .",
    ", @xmath57 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 and audit probability @xmath63 , and @xmath54 for @xmath58 sites ( nodes ) of ans and use @xmath64 time steps . here , for @xmath41 and @xmath62 ( c ) , we present the average over twenty different seeds . ]    to understand statistical errors , in fig .",
    "5 we plot tax evasion for ans with @xmath58 now for the case @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we found from 20 samples in part ( c ) that the tax evasion remains at around @xmath65 , but with fluctuations in time larger than from sample to sample : the probable errors are much smaller than the fluctuations seen in part ( c ) .",
    "less developed countries may have more tax evasion because of less trust in government @xcite . to study this problem zaklan et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a model , called here the zaklan model , using monte carlo simulations and a equilibrium dynamics ( ising model ) on square lattices .",
    "their results are in good agreement with analytical and experimental results obtained by @xcite . in this work",
    "we show that the zaklan model of tax evasiom is very robust because we use a nonequilibrium dynamics ( mvm ) to simulate the zaklan model , with results similar to equilibrium dynamics ( ising model ) @xcite , and also on various topologies @xcite .",
    "also here we found the plausible result that tax evasion is diminished by higher audit probability @xmath5 and stronger punishment @xmath6 .",
