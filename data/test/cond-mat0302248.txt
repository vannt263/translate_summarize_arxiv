    "the extent to which the normal state of the high @xmath0 superconductors is anomalous has long been debated .",
    "the most conclusive evidence for a break - down of fermi liquid theory has appeared relatively recently via a ( pseudo)gap in the fermionic spectrum with onset temperature @xmath4 .",
    "recent nernst@xcite and ac conductivity@xcite experiments have led to some of the most exotic indications for this pseudogap which , it is claimed , appear in the form of  vortices above @xmath0 \" . more generally ( but not universally ) one associates the complex of pseudogap phenomena with some form of precursor superconductivity .",
    "while normal state vortices are most closely associated with the well known phase fluctuation scenario@xcite , a primary goal of this paper is to address these same anomalous transport data@xcite within the alternative pair fluctuation scheme@xcite . in the process",
    ", we present a natural extension of time dependent ginsburg - landau ( tdgl ) theory and associated transport coefficients which addresses higher temperatures @xmath4 well outside the usual limited range of applicability near @xmath0 .",
    "it necessarily follows that the bosons appear as quantum rather than classical fields .",
    "the pair fluctuations which we discuss here have as a natural antecedent the gaussian fluctuations of tdgl . indeed , when pseudogap effects are weak ( @xmath5 ) tdgl theory has been found to provide a reasonably good @xcite representation of the non - critical fluctuation regime in the high temperature superconductors .",
    "in this way the presence of  pre - formed pairs \" has been demonstrated , albeit , in the narrow temperature window near @xmath0 .",
    "two important features of the cuprates suggest that bcs theory is not applicable in that dominant fraction of the phase diagram associated with the pseudogap phase .",
    "the anomalously short coherence length @xmath6 in the cuprates combined with the observation of a non - vanishing excitation gap present at the onset of superconductivity has motivated a number of authors@xcite to contemplate stronger than bcs attraction so that the bosonic degrees of freedom appear at a temperature @xmath4 which may be significantly larger than @xmath0 . below @xmath0",
    "the counterpart of these pre - formed pairs appears as non - condensed bosons .",
    "the resulting superconducting state is mid - way between bcs and bose einstein condensation ( bec)@xcite .",
    "one can , moreover , establish@xcite that this bcs - bec crossover approach is closely related to ( hartree - approximated ) tdgl theory .",
    "bosonic degrees of freedom are , in fact , stabilized by going beyond the usual@xcite gaussian approximation .",
    "when their interactions are included at the self consistent hartree level@xcite a fermionic pseudogap necessarily appears ; as a result of this depletion of the density of states , there are fewer fermions to which bosonic states can decay . at the hartree level the presence of bosons and the existence of a gap in the fermionic spectrum are two sides of the same coin .",
    "these pair fluctuation approaches differ from other boson - fermion models@xcite of high temperature superconductors because here the bosons naturally dissociate into fermions , and similarly fermion pairs may recombine .",
    "hartree approaches to pair fluctuations also differ from the widely discussed phase fluctuation scenario which focuses on fluctuations in the order parameter , and underlying mott physics . in the pair fluctuation",
    "approach the emphasis is on the observed small @xmath6 .",
    "because it is a mean field theory , this scheme is not appropriate to the critical regime and critical exponents here belong to the gaussian rather than @xmath7 class .",
    "while coulombic effects are profound for order parameter fluctuations in the ordered state , here they are less important , for precisely the same reasons that they are omitted in traditional tdgl@xcite . as in bcs theory ,",
    "coulomb interactions may also enter the binding and unbinding of pairs insofar as they renormalize or even , for non-@xmath8 wave superconductors@xcite , stabilize the attraction between fermions .    while there are microscopic theories@xcite which serve to justify tdgl , the related diagrammatic formalism can become prohibitively complex and as a consequence , the bosonic contributions to transport properties are more readily deduced@xcite using tdgl theory directly .",
    "this , then , leads to the present focus on establishing a quantum extension of tdgl which is thereby amenable to detailed transport studies , at higher temperatures @xmath4 . to proceed ,",
    "we construct a simplified model of charged bosons subject to quantum dissipation , which has tdgl ( with a non - bcs parameter set ) as its special limit .",
    "pair fluctuations involve the continuous dissociation and recombination of fermion pairs . to simulate this behavior we follow caldeira and leggett and treat the fermions as reservoir harmonic oscillators@xcite coupled to the bosons .",
    "coulomb and hard core interactions between bosons are treated at the same level as in hartree - approximated tdgl .",
    "we end by summarizing the key experiments we will address here .",
    "we focus on those experiments where the bosonic contributions dominate over their fermionic counterparts .",
    "it is convenient to define the electrical current @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to the behavior in a fermi liquid , a sizeable nernst signal @xmath10 ( reflecting a combination of components of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 tensors@xcite ) appears at an onset temperature appreciably above @xmath0 , called @xmath13 ; this temperature is loosely associated with @xmath4 . in the insulating phase , the thermoelectric response function @xmath14 , as well as",
    "@xmath15 vanish at @xmath16 .",
    "precursor effects are similarly observed@xcite in the imaginary component , @xmath17 , of @xmath12 at @xmath18 , which set in below @xmath19 , but appreciably above @xmath0 .",
    "thus far , these onset temperatures are significantly below their counterparts for @xmath14 . moreover ,",
    "for the range of frequencies measured , these complex conductivity data can be fit@xcite to a rescaled kosterlitz - thouless form which allows extraction of a phase correlation time @xmath20 . in view of the above @xmath12 and @xmath11 experiments",
    ", it has seemed rather mysterious that the diamagnetic magnetization@xcite , has a relatively non - existent normal state precursor .",
    "finally , the dc resistivity has been measured somewhat systematically@xcite in the underdoped regime .",
    "there is evidence for an onset temperature @xmath21 of roughly the same order of magnitude as in the other transport experiments . at this temperature",
    "an enhancement of the conductivity is evident .",
    "however , the magnitude of the deviation from the fermionic contribution is not noticeably large except in the immediate vicinity of @xmath0 .",
    "analysis of these data do , however , depend on assigning a particular temperature dependence to this background fermionic contribution .",
    "the time dependent ginsberg - landau equation ( tdgl ) @xmath22 is a natural starting point for characterizing the dynamics of bosons .",
    "this equation describes the fluctuational regime of conventional superconductors in the vicinity of @xmath0 , where the bosonic degrees of freedom are represented by the wavefunction @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 represents the bosonic charge , ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) is the electromagnetic potential which determines the em fields via the usual formulae @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the units adopted in this paper correspond to si , with @xmath29 .",
    "the dynamics is importantly controlled by @xmath30 which is a white noise function satisfying @xmath31 generally we contemplate complex @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in this paper",
    "we focus on a description in which bosonic degrees of freedom may be treated as uncorrelated . for the tdgl case this corresponds to applying a hartree approximation to eq .   so that , @xmath35 here @xmath36 represents the ( absolute value of the ) bosonic chemical potential which vanishes at the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 , which is to be distinguished from @xmath37 at which @xmath38 .",
    "frequently one ignores the quartic term altogether , as in strict gaussian fluctuation theories@xcite .",
    "an interpretation as well as justification for tdgl can be provided by microscopic t - matrix approaches , based on the well known aslamazov - larkin diagrams@xcite . with the inclusion of hartree",
    "effects@xcite the fluctuations have characteristic gaussian exponents while hartree self consistency contributions lead to a slightly modified t - matrix scheme@xcite .    at the more macroscopic level of eq.([eq : tdgl ] )",
    "the fermions in a superconductor are irrelevant .",
    "nevertheless , microscopic theory makes it clear that the bosonic degrees of freedom correspond to fermion pairs ; moreover , it is the fermions which are ultimately responsible for the complex noise parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the self consistent hartree approximation introduces a fermionic exitation gap@xcite ( or  pseudogap \" ) which is present at the onset of superconductivity .",
    "this depletion in the density of states is responsible for the fact that the transition temperature ( contained in @xmath36 ) is lowered , relative to @xmath37 .    despite its significant success in describing conventional superconducting fluctuations , tdgl has known limitations@xcite . in the context of understanding high @xmath0 superconductors , one of the most serious of these is the necessity of introducing artificial cut - offs in the fluctuational spectrum@xcite , often to depress the fluctuational contributions to transport .",
    "other extensions of tdgl have been proposed which involve introducing a modification@xcite to the bcs - derived parameter set of eq.([eq : tdgl ] ) , although for some experiments@xcite strict bcs theory appears to work quite well .",
    "what is most perplexing about high @xmath0 superconductors is the appearance of  pseudogap \" effects with onset temperature @xmath4 .",
    "as @xmath4 progressively increases away from @xmath0 , a strict bcs approach to fluctuation - based calculations of transport appears to be invalidated@xcite .",
    "_ it is the premise of the present paper that the precursor superconductivity of the pseudogap phase evolves continuously from the conventional fluctuation behavior _ seen , for example , in overdoped high @xmath0 samples .",
    "while one does not expect tdgl to hold for @xmath39 significantly larger than @xmath0 , our goal here is to propose a natural extension of this theory appropriate for @xmath39 well above @xmath0 . in this regime ,",
    "the relaxation time of the bosons becomes comparable to or smaller than @xmath40 ; thus , the classical fluctuation - dissipation in tdgl should be replaced by a suitable quantum counterpart . in this way we treat @xmath41 in eq.([eq : tdgl ] ) as a field theoretic operator representing the annihilation of bosons .",
    "one of the most important parameters in this extended tdgl theory is @xmath4 which will enter into the bosonic chemical potential .",
    "this is the temperature at which the number of bosons vanishes .",
    "one may view @xmath4 alternatively as the onset of the fermionic pseudogap .",
    "these two viewpoints are two sides of the same coin , since bosons disappear or dissociate when fermions are no longer bound .",
    "to gain a deeper understanding of the essence of tdgl and of its prior success away from the pseudogap ( or underdoped ) regime@xcite , we thus study a hamiltonian describing bosons on a @xmath42-dimensional lattice coupled to a quantum reservoir .",
    "our treatment of the reservoir has strong similarities to the approach of caldeira and leggett@xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the boson annihilation operator at lattice site @xmath45 and time @xmath46 , annihilation operators for the reservoir , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( with infinitesimal coupling constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , are associated with positive and negative frequencies respectively , although the energies @xmath51 s and @xmath52 s are all positive .",
    "that two sets of reservoir operators are necessary will become clear later when we compare with standard tdgl .",
    "here @xmath53 is the hopping matrix element of the bosons , to be distinguished from its electronic counterpart , and @xmath54 .",
    "surface effects appear via the @xmath45 dependence of @xmath55 which also contains the hartree interaction between bosons .",

    "we solve eqs .   and in the temporal gauge ( @xmath57 ) to express @xmath47 and @xmath58 in terms of both @xmath59 and their values at an initial time @xmath60 . substituting into eq .",
    ", we find @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the local temperature and @xmath63 the fourier transform of @xmath64 it is reasonable to assume that this self energy , like any other , is smooth and that it vanishes as @xmath65 . here",
    "@xmath66 is a function which represents a generalized or quantum noise .",
    "the coupling between the @xmath41 field and each reservoir field is infinitesimal , so that the reservoir satisfies ideal bose statistics and @xmath67 with @xmath68 the bose function .",
    "the physics of the bosons , transport , magnetization , specific heat , density , etc , are governed by eqs .   and .",
    "the reservoir parameters @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are all subsumed into the boson self energy @xmath69 . from this point",
    "forward we ignore these quantities in favor of the boson self energy .",
    "moreover , @xmath69 depends only on @xmath70 for our localized reservoir .",
    "this simplification is supported principally by the fact that this model captures the key physics found in microscopic schemes@xcite , where it is sufficient to consider just the leading order @xmath71 dependences .",
    "differences between this previous strong coupling t - matrix approach@xcite and the present phenomenological boson model , are to be associated with the fact that the former scheme assumes that the t - matrix has fermionic constituents .",
    "these lead to a fine @xmath70 structure arising from the fermionic pseudogap@xcite , as well as to different high @xmath70 asymptotics .",
    "the ensuing simplification of boson physics , however , makes our model far more tractable .    in the spatially uniform case ,",
    "the fourier transform of eq",
    ".   takes a simple form : @xmath72 with @xmath73 , and @xmath74    we are now in a position to clarify the relationship between this theory and tdgl .",
    "when @xmath39 is close to @xmath0 , the bosonic relaxation rate @xmath75 is considerably smaller than @xmath39 ( typically of the order of tens or hundreds of kelvin ) . in this regime",
    "the dynamics is dominated by low frequencies @xmath76 , and the bose function is well approximated by @xmath77 .",
    "we presume that the high energy cut - off scale @xmath78 in @xmath69 , which is associated with the reservoir , is of the order of typical electronic energies , thus thousands of k. then , at low frequencies , the bosonic self energy is given by the linear functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 where from eq .",

    "in the same way eq .   is reduced to eq .",
    ", with the important parameter @xmath81 we may now see that the two sets of reservoir fields , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , are associated with opposite charges , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ; they contribute to the positive and negative frequency regimes of @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "if either of these two were omitted , @xmath69 would vanish on one side of the origin ; thus , the slope of @xmath69 would be discontinuous across zero frequency , and one would never arrive at the tdgl limit , no matter how small the frequency .",
    "_ in summary , the boson model presented in this paper is a natural quantum extension of tdgl .",
    "conversely , tdgl is the low frequency limit of our quantum boson model_.    in preparation for computing transport coefficients , we introduce the bosonic correlation function , which can be derived from eqs .   and .",

    "[ fig : resistivity ] we plot dc resistivity curves , @xmath188 vs. @xmath39 for an optimal and underdoped system .",
    "in addition to the bosonic contribution we have added a fairly generic@xcite linear - in-@xmath39 contribution from the fermions , as the background term .",
    "the underdoped sample has the same parameters as in previous figures with @xmath178 .",
    "for the optimally doped case we take @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "it is clear that the transition region is wider for the underdoped system .",
    "the increased separation between @xmath4 and @xmath0 , and the much elongated boson relaxation time , are responsible for this widening .",
    "our optimal results compare favorably with those in the literature@xcite .",
    "for the underdoped case , the wider than experimentally observed@xcite transition regime that we find in @xmath188 is closely connected to the behavior seen in the ac conductivity of figure 2 . and",
    "the latter is compatible with the experiments of ref ..",
    "dimensionality also plays an important role in determining the behavior of the paraconductivity . in the upper left inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : resistivity ] , we plot the resistivity for a comparably underdoped , but more three dimensional material , such as ybco .",
    "increased 3-dimensionality ( _ via _ increased c - axis coherence length ) clearly shrinks the appararent transition range of @xmath188 .",
    "this can be traced to the reduced bosonic density of states in the low energy regime . to see how the change of dimensionality affects the nernst coefficient",
    ", we present a plot of @xmath14 in the lower inset for this same sample .",
    "the onset for nernst is roughly 40k above @xmath0 .",
    "this contrasts sharply with that of @xmath188 which is at most a few k above @xmath0 .",
    "_ thus , the same sample , with exactly the same parameters , appears to have very different onset temperatures for resistivity and nernst .",
    "_ it should be noted that if one looks closely at the plot of @xmath188 a small downward curvature develops well above @xmath0 , which can be traced to @xmath4 effects .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the effects of pre - formed pairs or bosonic degrees of freedom on normal state transport properties . our goal was to provide insight into transport anomalies in the high temperature superconductors .",
    "these anomalies are associated with non - fermi liquid - like observations , many of which seem to be rather similar to what is found in the presence of superconducting fluctuations . by contrast to the standard fluctuations of tdgl theory , however , these pre - formed pairs appear at relatively high temperatures @xmath4 compared to @xmath0 . throughout our discussion , it should be stressed that we view @xmath4 as a  crossover \" temperature , rather than a sharp phase transition .",
    "the origin of these preformed pairs is not specified .",
    "they may arise from the strong attractive interaction which drives the superconductivity .",
    "( indeed , attractive interactions in a _ non _",
    "@xmath8-wave channel@xcite are possible , despite the presence of strong coulombic effects ) .",
    "however , one may entertain as well other scenarios for the mechanism of pair formation .    in the process of addressing transport",
    "we have devised a new formalism for extending tdgl into the quantum regime , well away from the transition temperature where the bosons condense .",
    "our approach , moreover , allows exact calculations of all transport properties and , in the immediate vicinity of @xmath0 , our results are equivalent to those of standard tdgl .",
    "comparison with experiment is quite satisfactory .",
    "it should be stressed that no particular fitting to the data was done , but rather in this paper we have explored the generic features of the model .",
    "moreover , we have addressed a wide variety of different experiments : nernst , ac and dc conductivity and diamagnetic measurements . aside from introducing a quantum statistical treatment of the bosons , a key feature of our approach is the introduction of the important temperature @xmath4 .",
    "this is a new concept , not present in tdgl .",
    "pairs now form far from the critical regime .",
    "but at the same time @xmath4 provides an ultimate cut - off .",
    "there are no bosons ( or fermionic pseudogap ) beyond this regime .",
    "our paper shows that transport anomalies are compatible with the presence of bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the same inference is made from thermodynamic and arpes experiments which deduce the onset of a gap in the fermionic spectrum .",
    "indeed , we view these broad classes of phenomena as two sides of the same coin . one of the key conclusions of this paper is that onset temperatures for transport anomalies vary from one experiment to another",
    ". moreover , all are considerably lower than @xmath4 .",
    "the boson contribution to transport depends sensitively on the pair life time @xmath147 . only sufficiently long lived bosons significantly contribute to transport .",
    "hence bosonic contributions to transport are suppressed well before @xmath4 is reached .",
    "ours should be viewed as an alternative to the vortex scenario or related phase fluctuation picture for addressing normal state transport anomalies .",
    "indeed , it has been recently suggested@xcite that phase fluctuations alone can not explain pseudogap phenomena . the reasonable agreement between the _ generic _ results of the present theory and experiment for all the figures",
    "provides support for a preformed - pair alternative to this vortex scenario .",
    "non - condensed bosons are also present below @xmath0 and , thereby , will lead to some continuity between transport coefficients across the transition . in extending this work to the _",
    "ordered _ phase , however , it will be useful to find a relationship between bosons and vortices .",
    "along these lines is the dual representation explored earlier@xcite in which vortices are the basic particles , rather than cooper pairs .                                                          for the underdoped samples , illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : alpha],[fig : sigma ] and [ fig : kt ] and the underdoped curve in the main body of fig .",
    "[ fig : resistivity ] we choose @xmath194 to fit the onset temperature of @xmath195 at 100ghz@xcite .    here",
    "the quantity that is determined is actually @xmath196 .",
    "a similar situation holds for @xmath130 and @xmath142 . due to the approximate linearity of @xmath122",
    ", only combinations such as @xmath197 or @xmath198 appear in low frequency ( @xmath199 ) observables .",
    "this formula assumes that @xmath200 and @xmath201 . for larger values of @xmath78 ,",
    "the first term still increases with the ratio @xmath202 , but slower than @xmath203 . for @xmath204 comparable",
    "to or greater than @xmath39 , the second term will decay slower with increasing @xmath204 , and wo nt be zero or even negative , as this small @xmath204 formula would suggest .",
    "the pair life time is thus on the order of @xmath205 at @xmath206 .",
    "if @xmath207 , as seems to be the case according to our analysis , this implies that bosonic transport is negligible well before @xmath4 is reached , as is confirmed by all transport experiments including the nernst effect .",
