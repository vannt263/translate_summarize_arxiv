    "the cosmological creation of the gravitational waves was proposed by grishchuk @xcite in the mid - seventies . since that time",

    "gravitons produced during the inflation fill the entire space in the form of a stochastic background . together with the scalar modes , produced during the inflation",
    ", they form primordial perturbations leading to the structure formation .",
    "the analysis of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structures gives therefore the possibility of testing inflationary models . in the case of the cmb",
    "the impact of the gravitational waves comes from the primordial spectrum and from tensor sachs - wolfe effects .",
    "the sachs - wolfe effect is somehow secondary and leads to the cbm anisotropies as the result of the scattering of cmb photons on the relic gravitons .",
    "the form of this anisotropies is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 describes tensor modes and @xmath2 is the vector parallel to the unperturbed geodesics .",
    "the influence of the gravitational waves for the cmb is however to weak to be observed directly with the present observational abilities .",
    "another possible method to detect gravitational waves is to use of the antennas like ligo , virgo , tama or geo600 @xcite .",
    "although these detectors are now very sensitive this is still not enough to detect directly the gravitational waves background @xcite .",
    "it may look pessimistic , we hope however that some further improvement of the observational skills bring us the observational evidence , so needful for the further theoretical improvements .",
    "in this paper we consider a new type of the inflation which naturally occurs in the loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "this is so called the super - inflationary scenario @xcite and is a result of the quantum nature of spacetime in the planck scales .",
    "the spacetime is namely discrete in the quantum regime and its evolution is governed by discrete equations .",
    "however for the scales greater than @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is so called barbero - immirzi parameter ) the evolution of the spacetime can be described by the einstein equations with quantum corrections . for typical values of the quantum numbers ,",
    "super - inflationary phase takes place in this semi - classical region .",
    "our goal is to describe the production of the gravitational waves during the super - inflation .",
    "this problem was preliminary analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but quantum corrections to the equation for tensor modes was not included to calculate the spectrum of the gravitons . in this paper we include so called inverse volume corrections to the equation for evolution of the tensor modes and then calculate the spectrum of produced gravitational waves . the equations for the tensor modes",
    "was recently derived by bojowald and hossain @xcite .",
    "they had analysed the inverse volume corrections and corrections from holonomies . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on these first ones .",
    "the quantum corrections are generally complicated functions but they have simple asymptotic behaviours",

    "we obtained presently a negligible amount of relic gravitons .",
    "however in the second model without inflation the present amount of graviton background would be unnaturally high .",
    "this results state that the period of inflation after the super - inflation is necessary to avoid the problem of relic gravitons . nowadays",
    "the main motivation to introduce the inflationary phase comes from ability to creation of fluctuations .",
    "our investigations based on loop quantum cosmology support the inflationary model .",
    "results obtained in this work differ from our previous investigations @xcite .",
    "the difference comes mainly from different assumptions about the evolution of the universe after the super - inflation .",
    "the previous results correspond to the situation when inflation and gut energy scales cover each other rather than to the case of very short inflation . in this paper",
    "we have considered both models agreeing with the present paradigm and its modification .",
