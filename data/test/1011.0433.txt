    "star - forming disk galaxies at @xmath0 differ from their local counterparts in several aspects : they are more gas - rich and rapidly star - forming , and have irregular morphologies and high gas velocity dispersions .",
    "spatially resolved observations of their rest - frame uv and optical continuum light often reveal large ( @xmath1 ) clumps @xcite .",
    "clumpy morphologies are also observed with star - formation tracers such as @xmath8 ( e.g.  the sins survey ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrally resolved line emissions reveal ordered rotation and high velocity dispersions , widespread across the disks at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the large @xmath0 star - forming galaxies have been considered as marginally - unstable thick disks , where the large random motions set the large masses and sizes of unstable regions that collapse into giant clumps @xcite . in this picture",
    ", the high star - formation rates result from the high growth rates of cosmic structures at @xmath0 @xcite , as gas funnels directly from the cosmic web to the vicinity of galaxies in a cold - mode accretion @xcite .",
    "however , several observational clues have not yet been addressed in this framework .",
    "first , vigorous outflows are observed from a variety of star - forming galaxies at high redshift , both globally ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and from individual giant clumps @xcite .",
    "second , high signal - to - noise observations of individual giant clumps reveal only minor kinematical signatures , sometimes indicating dynamical masses lower than alternative independent clump mass estimates @xcite .",
    "third , comparisons of abundance and clustering of galaxies and dark matter halos suggests that at @xmath0 , much like at @xmath10 , typically not more than @xmath11 of the baryons associated with halos of any mass have turned into stars @xcite , causing some tension with the high efficiency of cold - mode accretion .",
    "further on , one aspect of the theoretical picture that developed in recent years is that the giant clumps lose angular momentum and energy due to dynamical friction in the disk , clump - clump interactions , and internal torques within the disk , and thereby spiral in to the center of the galaxy .",
    "this has been based on two main lines of argument .",
    "first , age gradients have been inferred in clumpy disks from the presence of a redder / older component often coinciding or close to the galaxy center @xcite .",
    "also , a correlation has been found between the relative dynamical dominance of that central component to a ( metallicity - based ) age estimate for the system , which has been interpreted as indicative of a time sequence , where older systems have had more time to transform part of their disks into bulges via clump migration @xcite .",
    "second , numerical simulations , both of isolated unstable disks @xcite and of cosmological @xmath0 disks @xcite , find the clumps to evolve in that fashion , and theoretical considerations also suggest there should be a significant inflow rate inside the disk @xcite . recently @xcite used deep higher - resolution nic2 imaging to identify more robustly clumps in rest - frame optical emission , and , in combination with ao - assisted sinfoni @xmath8 observations and acs imaging , radial trends in clump stellar age with distance to galaxy center were inferred .",
    "this result appears consistent with the theoretical inspiraling picture , as noted by @xcite .",
    "therefore , a crucial issue is whether giant clumps can survive long enough to become stellar - dominated and/or sink to the centers of their galaxies , contributing to the buildup of bulges .",
    "conflicting theoretical claims have been made @xcite , while probing that question directly with observations is a difficult task .",
    "therefore , the qualitative agreement between simulations and observations has been interpreted as supporting the picture of long - lived migrating clumps . however , none of the cosmological or isolated simulations reported so far ( but see @xcite ) , which find long - lived migrating clumps , include strong galactic winds , which as noted already are directly observed . as the clumpy phase appears to be ubiquitous at @xmath12 ,",
    "it is of fundamental importance for our understanding of galaxy formation to know what role giant clumps play in building bulges / spheroids .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate as a proof of principle that incorporating galactic superwinds resulting from stellar feedback into the existing theoretical picture , can have important implications for our understanding of @xmath0 disks and their evolution .",
    "we use hydrodynamical cosmological simulations to investigate the formation and properties of a sample of star - forming disks .",
    "we use a phenomenological model for the generation of galactic winds to test a scenario in which galactic superwinds are a major driving force in shaping galaxy disks at high redshift . the phenomenological a priori parameters of our model",
    "match the observed properties of winds in the type of galaxies we are considering .",
    "our results are heavily dependent on this phenomenology , hence the uncertainty in the observations of such winds is a source of uncertainty for the basic assumptions of our model .",
    "however , we find that the implications of implementing such winds in simulations , namely that the giant clumps are short - lived transient features , and thus do not survive to migrate to the centers of their galaxies to form a bulge , are consistent with the existing observational constraints .",
    "hence , we propose a new scenario for the evolution of @xmath0 clumpy disks .",
    "we run zoom - in cosmological simulations focused on individual halos taken from the @xmath13 cosmological dark matter simulation presented in @xcite for the following cosmological parameters : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . as we focus on massive disks with high star - formation rates ( sfr ) , we select at @xmath20 halos of @xmath4 with instantaneous dark matter growth rates exceeding @xmath21 and that had no major merger ( mass ratio @xmath22 ) since @xmath23 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the second criterion selects approximately half of the halos of that mass at that redshift , and together these criteria are met by @xmath24 of those halos , i.e.  our galaxies form in halos that are neither the most typical nor very special or rare . from this sample , we randomly selected nine halos and generated zoom - in initial conditions for re - simulations including baryons , as in @xcite .",
    "our scheme results in high - resolution regions of @xmath25 comoving , on a side , i.e.  approximately @xmath26 times larger ( in volume ) than our main halos at @xmath0 .",
    "the mass resolution of our simulations is @xmath27 and @xmath28 for baryonic and high - resolution dark matter particles , respectively .",
    "the gravitational softening lengths of baryonic particles are @xmath29 , constant in comoving units , resulting in physical softening lengths of @xmath30 at @xmath20 .    the cosmological box is evolved to @xmath20 using a version of the n - body / sph code _ gadget-2 _ @xcite that is very similar to the one described in @xcite .",
    "this version includes ionisation and heating by a uniform background radiation @xcite in the optically thin limit , atomic cooling down to @xmath31 from hydrogen and metals , star - formation and feedback , as well as mass loss and metal enrichment from agb stars and supernovae of types ii and ia .",
    "the @xcite version of the code uses the @xcite star - formation prescription , where stars form stochastically from the gas according to a @xcite law that reproduces the @xcite gas surface density to star - formation relation .",
    "in addition , that prescription includes a sub - grid model for supernova feedback that results in an effective equation of state for the star - forming gas @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the gas pressure , and @xmath34 its physical density .",
    "the running index @xmath35 in the @xcite model is rather high at low and medium densities ( a stiff equation of state ) , but becomes negative at high densities , such that the thermal jeans mass @xmath36 can rapidly drop below the resolution of the simulation @xcite .",
    "the stiffness of this equation of state at medium densities allows construction of stable disk models ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is less relevant for simulations of marginally - unstable disks .",
    "therefore , we replaced the star - formation model in the @xcite code with the @xcite approach . there , the usual cooling and heating operate at @xmath37 , while for @xmath38 a polytropic equation of state with @xmath39 is implemented .",
    "this ensures that the ( thermal ) jeans mass @xmath36 remains constant with varying density and does not become unresolved . here",
    "@xmath40 is defined such that @xmath41 at @xmath42 and @xmath31 .",
    "star - formation is parameterised as @xmath43 with the star - formation density threshold @xmath44 .",
    "this reproduces the @xcite star - formation relation @xcite .",
    "a further addition we introduced to the code is that we calculate the local minimum ( over all directions ) of the gas surface density @xmath45 @xcite , and suppress star - formation if @xmath46 .",
    "this modification has only minor consequences for our results .",
    "the feedback scheme developed by @xcite builds on the kinetic feedback scheme of @xcite , where star - forming gas particles are stochastically kicked with velocities in the @xmath47 direction , where @xmath48 is the particle s velocity prior to the kick and @xmath49 its acceleration .",
    "@xcite introduced a significant modification to this mechanism by tuning the two parameters that control the wind . in their prescription , the magnitude of the kick is @xmath50 and the mass - loading factor @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the luminosity factor , @xmath53 is the velocity dispersion of the galaxy that is calculated from its mass,^{1/3}$ ] . for calculation efficiency , a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm is used .",
    "we use a linking length @xmath54 that is an improvement over the constant @xmath55 used in @xcite , since it is calibrated to the skid group finder at various redshifts . ] and @xmath56 is a constant ( here @xmath57 , as in @xcite ) . introducing @xmath53-dependencies , these two parameters then scale with the mass of the galaxy , following the theory of momentum - driven winds induced by the radiation pressure from young stars @xcite .",
    "the momentum budget available from feedback from young stars is somewhat uncertain .",
    "@xcite estimate the momentum injection from radiation pressure of ob stars ( per unit stellar mass formed ) to be @xmath58 , and a similar amount of momentum from supernova explosions .",
    "@xcite , however , estimate the specific momentum available from supernovae to be @xmath59 . in addition , high dust column densities can provide large optical depths that increase the amount of momentum injection by radiation pressure by factors of several ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , stellar winds can also inject similar amounts of momentum @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath60 , such that the value that we use for the momentum injection per unit stellar mass formed , @xmath61 , is a physically plausible value , even if on the high side .",
    "note that we use higher wind velocities than in @xcite .",
    "this ensures the escape of all wind particles from the disk , in particular from regions in the disk that have higher escape velocities than the mean one .",
    "this change is necessary , since we have a significantly higher resolution in this work , such that the center of the galaxy may become dense enough for its escape velocity to be higher than that at the edge of the disk .",
    "the scalings of the momentum - driven winds are in accordance with observational evidence for the scalings of galactic winds ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the typical velocities we obtain with this model for the central galaxies considered are @xmath62 , in agreement with observations .",
    "the typical mass - loading factor for our central galaxies is @xmath63 , also in order - of - magnitude agreement with observations , although the observational determination of the mass - loading factors is far less certain than that of the wind velocities ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .    in the @xcite and @xcite models ,",
    "subsequent to being given a velocity kick , gas particles are temporarily decoupled from hydrodynamic interactions to allow them to propagate out of their star - formation sites and eventually leave their galaxies .",
    "when simply giving gas particles momentum kicks rather than using a more sophisticated physical model ( in a better - resolved interstellar medium ) , the only way to achieve winds that escape the vicinity of the galaxies ( rather than efficiently becoming a galactic fountain ) is by using the temporary decoupling method @xcite .",
    "moreover , even high resolution simulations of isolated galaxies have so far had difficulties in forming efficient winds when having full hydrodynamics and cooling ( e.g.  @xcite ) . however , such winds are observed , and emerge out of @xmath0 galaxies to large distances @xcite .",
    "therefore , we keep the decoupling prescriptions adopted by @xcite .",
    "we have , however , modified the @xcite code to ensure that the velocity kicks are perpendicular to the disk ( e.g.  @xcite , bouch et al .  in prep . ) .",
    "this is done by calculating the direction of the velocity kicks wind particles are given as @xmath64 , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the velocity and acceleration of the launched wind particle just before the kick , and @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the velocity and acceleration of the center - of - mass of the galaxy , i.e.  @xmath47 is calculated in the inertial frame of the galaxy .",
    "the theoretical considerations and actual observations of winds from galaxies are augmented by further motivation for using the @xcite model , namely this strong galactic winds model succesfully matches several important observations :    * properties of the intergalactic medium , such as metallicity and ionization state @xcite . *",
    "the galaxy mass - metallicity relation @xcite .",
    "* high galactic gas fractions at high redshift ( section [ s : global_properties ] and @xcite ) . *",
    "low fraction of cosmic baryons in galaxies at all redshifts ( section [ s : global_properties ] and @xcite ) .    it should be kept in mind , however , that the simulations presented in this work have much higher resolution than previous works that employed the @xcite model .",
    "therefore , some adverse side effects can not be excluded before a large cosmological box is run with a similarly high resolution .",

    "our simulated halos are presented ( _ symbols _ ) alongside the same quantity as it is estimated from comparisons of galaxy and halo clustering and abundances ( @xcite ; _ curves _ ) .",
    "the baryon conversion efficiency is a strong function of mass in our simulations , though not as strong as observations indicate , such that small dark matter halos in our simulations probably host too massive galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these observed correlations are important constraints that should be reproduced in realistic simulated galaxies .",
    "the sfr versus stellar mass ` main sequence ' relation has received significant attention in recent years and it is a key constraint for galaxy evolution . the gas fraction of galaxies is a dominant factor in their dynamics , and the baryonic conversion efficiency controls the number density of galaxies . regardless of the imperfect agreement with observations ( in particular at halo / galaxy masses below the scale that is the focus of this paper ) , the global correlations in figure [ f : global_relations ] are a result of the galactic winds model we are using , without which they would compare much worse to the observations @xcite .",
    "for example , the three clumpy disks simulated by @xcite in a cosmological context with less effective feedback have gas fractions as low as @xmath83 and baryon conversion efficiencies as high as @xmath84 , both indicating too little suppression of star - formation when compared to observations .",
    "it is apparent that our prescriptions dump more momentum per baryon than used in , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . as such",
    ", our sub - grid models may seem extreme and the negative impact of winds on the clump survival ( section [ s : clump_evolution ] ) overdone .",
    "however , consider what would happen if we switch off this recipe , or substantially turn down its efficacy . to this end , we have performed additional experiments , where we used less efficient winds , either by injecting less momentum ( using slower winds , or winds with lower mass - loading factors ) , or by not temporarily decoupling the wind particles from the hydrodynamics . if the winds are not decoupled they can not escape the vicinity of the galaxies and are ineffective @xcite .",
    "in these experiments , we obtained galaxies with very different properties , in agreement with similar results from the literature ( reviewed above ) , and in contrarst with observations .",
    "for example , when halo _",
    "s224 _ is simulated when winds are not temporarily decoupled from the hydrodynamics , we obtain a central galaxy at @xmath20 with low specific star formation rate ( @xmath85 compared to @xmath86 in the fiducial model ) , low gas fraction ( @xmath87 compared to the fiducial @xmath88 ) , high baryonic conversion efficiency ( @xmath89 compared to the fiducial @xmath90 ) , high ( and peaked ) rotation curve ( with the peak at @xmath91 compared to the fiducial @xmath92 ) , and small size ( @xmath93 compared to @xmath94 ) .",
    "moreover , the clumpy nature of the galaxies , discussed in detail in the following sections , is also lost under such conditions .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in figure [ f : sigmagasmaps ] we present gas surface density maps of four galaxies from our sample ( large panels ) .",
    "the mean gas surface densities inside radii of @xmath95 have values ranging from @xmath96 . however , the gas surface density is far from constant in the disk , but rather exhibits strong local maxima , to which we hereafter refer as clumps. the perturbed morphologies , and the clumps , are the result of disk instabilities rather than external interactions , as will be discussed in section [ s : clump_evolution ] .",
    "the typical gas surface densities of clumps are up to ten times higher than the mean disk surface densities , i.e.  @xmath97 .",
    "the clumps tend to be embedded inside transient ring - like features , although not exclusively . the clumpy morphologies of the gas ( and hence sfr ) are clearly visible also after being smoothed to the resolution of typical good ao - assisted observations ( fwhm=@xmath98 ) , as shown in the small panels , in face - on as well as edge - on views ( top and bottom small panels for each galaxy ) .",
    "after this smoothing , the typical contrast ratio ( clump - to - disk mean surface densities ) is reduced to @xmath99 .",
    "the total sfr in all clumps is @xmath100 of the total disk sfr .",

    "the gas is distributed mainly in a ring with a radius of @xmath101 ( figure [ f : s224_snap284](c ) ) .",
    "the ring , which is transient , formed from spiral features in the disk rather than by an interaction ( there are no interactions with stellar mass ratios @xmath102 since @xmath103 ) .",

    ", we find that the clumps are local minima with @xmath119 ( figure [ f : s224_snap284](f ) ) .",
    "the clumps form in - situ : they are not accreted from outside the disk , but rather form inside the disk via gravitational instability in an environment that has @xmath120 .",

    "the clump masses are @xmath121 orders of magnitude larger than the thermal jeans mass , but match the largest unstable jeans scale ( the toomre mass ) in a turbulent disk @xmath122 @xcite , which is driven to high values by the large random motions in the disk .",
    "a notable characteristic of the clumps is their short lifetimes , @xmath123 , or about half a disk orbital time .",
    "the top row in figure [ f : clump_evolution ] demonstrates the disruption of a clump in _",
    "s224 _ by showing a time series of gas surface density maps . in the upper right - most panel of figure",
    "[ f : clump_evolution ] , the gas masses of three clumps are shown as a function of time ( _ solid _ ) , demonstrating their rapid formation and disruption .",
    "in contrast , the bottom row of figure [ f : clump_evolution ] shows the evolution of the same clump in an experiment where we temporarily turn the wind off .",
    "the clump does not disrupt , instead it collapses further and virialises , and subsequently migrates to the galaxy center .",
    "this demonstrates that the clumps are destroyed by the wind feedback , and do survive ( our equation - of - state is sufficiently soft to allow for this ) , as found in previous simulations , when such feedback is absent ( or much weaker than adopted in our sub - grid model ) .",
    "the reason for the disruption of clumps by the wind is the following . in our model ,",
    "the wind mass - loading factor ( i.e.  the outflow rate over the sfr ) for @xmath124 galaxies at @xmath20 is @xmath63 @xcite , and the velocity ranges between @xmath62 .",
    "these wind parameters agree well with recent observational detections of gas outflowing from @xmath0 galaxies @xcite and clumps @xcite .",
    "star - formation in the clumps proceeds on a timescale @xmath125 ( according to the @xcite relation ) , thus winds drive gas out of the clumps on a timescale @xmath126 , which is comparable to the disk orbital time .",
    "the consequence is that the gas surface density in the clumps decreases faster than the rate at which it is replenished by the instability inside the disk , and so clump regions move from @xmath127 to @xmath128 ( and thus stop collapsing ) within a time that is shorter than the disk orbital time .",
    "the short lifetimes we find are consistent with the upper limits of @xmath129 derived for the stellar populations in the clumps @xcite .",
    "this is because the mean stellar ages of the clumps in our simulations are larger than the lifetimes of the clumps as star - forming overdensities ( see figure [ f : clump_age_vs_distance ] and accompanying discussion below ) .",
    "[ f : clump_evolution ]    given the masses and sizes of clumps ( table [ t : properties ] ) , their circular velocities equal @xmath130 .",
    "this is significantly larger than the velocity dispersion of the gas within them or their rotational velocities ( in particular if the galaxy - wide average velocity gradient is subtracted as background ) .",
    "typically the clumps have @xmath131 , or @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is their gravitational potential energy and @xmath134 the internal kinetic energy .",
    "thus , they are neither supported by pressure nor by rotation , and in fact they are not virialised .",
    "this is due to continuous feedback on a timescale shorter than the dynamical time , preventing virialisation before disruption .    , both for @xmath20 ( _ dots _ ) and @xmath135 ( _ circles _ ) .",
    "more distant clumps tend to be younger , because of the dominance of background stars in the clumps , and given the global age gradient of the galaxy .",
    "a similar relation for the clumps in the observed galaxy bx482 ( raw measurements , without background subtraction ) is shown as well ( _ squares _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "given that the observed ages are only relative ages , our simulations seem consistent with the observations of this galaxy .",
    "the important conclusion is that the observed trend of clump stellar age with distance ( see also @xcite ) is not necessarily an indication for clump migration to the center of the galaxy , as has been previously considered . ]",
    "[ f : clump_age_vs_distance ]    the clumps consist two types of stellar populations . first , ` background stars ' , which are part of the stellar disk at the locations where clumps form but are not necessarily bound to them , with an age distribution similar to that of the stellar disk as a whole .",
    "a dynamically cold stellar component also takes part in the instability , in addition to the gas , such that the local density of old ` background stars ' is increased in some clumps compared to the clump surroundings .",
    "the ` background stars ' comprise most of the stellar mass of the clumps , as the clumps typically convert just about @xmath136 of their peak gas mass into stars throughout their lifetime .",
    "second are ` clump stars ' , which form over the lifetime of a clump , and are almost all bound to their clumps , constituting typically up to @xmath137 of their _ stellar _ masses .    as a result",
    ", the mean age of the stellar populations inside clumps follows the global spatial age distribution of the background stars of the disk , with an additional small contribution of the clump stars , which makes the clumps typically be local age minima .",
    "we find that the stellar disks in our simulations have a negative age ( and metallicity ) gradient , which will be discussed in detail in future work .",
    "therefore , the mean ages of clumps also present a spatial gradient , such that clumps with older stellar populations are closer to the galaxy center .",
    "this is shown in figure [ f : clump_age_vs_distance ] .",
    "the trend we find is qualitatively consistent with observations , in spite of the fact that no individual clump actually migrates to the galaxy center as its stellar populations become older .",
    "a quantitative comparison to observations can not be performed yet , as measuring clump ages requires high - resolution , deep data taken with various instruments .",
    "for example , @xcite was able to measure clump ages for only one @xmath0 galaxy from their sample , bx482 , which are shown in figure [ f : clump_age_vs_distance ] ( _ squares _ ) .",
    "these measurements rely on @xmath8 equivalent width , and they are very sensitive to the assumptions made regarding the star - formation history . therefore , they should be taken only as relative ages , not absolute ones @xcite . a linear fit in the log - log plane to the clump age - distance relation from our simulations",
    "yields a slope of @xmath138 .",
    "the corresponding slope for the bx482 points shown in figure [ f : clump_age_vs_distance ] is @xmath139 .",
    "future comparisons of this correlation with larger galaxy samples , and with an improved treatment of possible biases both on the theoretical and observational sides , may be able to distinguish the slope we find from the @xmath140 slope found by @xcite for the case of migrating clumps .",
    "to conclude , the mere existence of an age gradient should not necessarily be interpreted as supporting the clump migration scenario ( see also @xcite for additional alternative interpretations ) .",
    "figure [ f : mock_sins ] shows mock sinfoni maps for _ s224 _ of @xmath8 intensity , velocity and velocity dispersion .",
    "they were obtained by converting sfr to @xmath8 luminosity using @xmath141=1.26\\times10^{41}\\times { \\rm sfr}[\\msunyr]$ ] @xcite , ` placing ' _ s224 _ at @xmath135 , convolving it with a gaussian to imitate a resolution of @xmath142 , and pasting it into a real sinfoni datacube with pixel scale @xmath143 that was obtained from the observations of a galaxy from the sins survey , at a redshift where no real galaxy exists .",
    "this results in realistic resolution and noise properties that correspond to a representative total integration time ( @xmath144 hours ) for our high - resolution sinfoni data sets @xcite .",
    "the clumpiness , smooth velocity field and relatively flat velocity dispersion map ( outside the center ) , which are the characteristics of real sins clumpy disks , are all well reproduced when observing our simulations .",
    "the most significant difference to the non - degraded images in figure [ f : s224_snap284 ] ( the left and middle columns can be directly compared in figures [ f : mock_sins ] and [ f : s224_snap284 ] ) is in the velocity dispersion map .",
    "the beam smearing increases the apparent velocity dispersion where there are velocity gradients ( this is the reason for the diagonal feature of high dispersion in the inclined image in figure [ f : mock_sins](c ) ) , and the clumps are no longer seen as clear minima . as a result ,",
    "the small but present velocity gradients across the clumps get smoothed out .",
    "thus , because of the non - virialised state of the clumps , and their being minima in velocity dispersion , they do not show strong features in observations at the currently available resolution of @xmath145 , even if their masses are dynamically significant .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the observations of @xcite ( but see @xcite for alternative explanations ) .",
    "[ f : mock_sins ]",
    "in this paper we use zoom - in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include a phenomenological model for efficient star - formation feedback in the form of fast momentum - driven winds with high mass - loading factors , to investigate the formation of star - forming disk galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "our wind model reproduces observed low baryon conversion efficiencies and high gas fractions , and we also find a good kinematical and morphological agreement with observations .",
    "in addition , we present an important numerical result , namely that in the presence of such winds , the giant clumps in @xmath0 disks , which form in - situ via gravitational instability , may be short - lived and unvirialised .",
    "this is because they lose mass to galactic outflows at a rate that is higher than the rate of their dynamical evolution , such that their collapse is halted in less than a disk orbital time after their formation , and before they reach virial equilibrium .",
    "we show that this scenario is plausibly consistent with most of the available observations of clumpy disks at @xmath0 : their global properties ( figure [ f : global_relations ] ) , their clumpiness ( figures [ f : sigmagasmaps ] and [ f : s224_snap284 ] ) , their kinematics and appearance in sinfoni observations ( figures [ f : s224_snap284 ] and [ f : mock_sins ] ) , and the gradient they show between clump stellar age and clump distance from the galaxy center ( figure [ f : clump_age_vs_distance ] ) .",
    "our results are in contrast to previous models that do not include fast winds with high mass - loading factors .",
    "we demonstrate that if we temporarily turn off the winds , we reproduce previous results where clumps are long - lived and migrate to the galaxy centers . therefore we are able to directly show that the winds are the critical component of our model that makes the clumps short - lived .",
    "however , if the wind is drastically reduced starting from the initial conditions of the simulations at high redshift , gas - rich unstable disks do not develop in the first place .",
    "instead , the galaxies become gas - poor , very massive ( compared to the halos inside which they form , i.e.  with very high baryon conversion efficiencies ) , and they develop very peaked rotation curves ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it should be stressed that our model of the winds is phenomenological , and our results are based on the working hypothesis of the existence of powerful superwinds with some given , a priori properties .",
    "our hypothesis still awaits further verification .",
    "for example , our feedback recipe assumes that gas can be blown out of the clumps and subsequently out of the galaxy at an imposed rate proportional to the star - formation rate .",
    "it remains to be better understood how this occurs on sub - clump scales based on improved physical models ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "also , the momentum we inject into the wind per unit stellar mass formed is at the high side of the theoretical expectations .",
    "while winds are observed to be ubiquitous in high - redshift galaxies , and in particular they have been recently observed from individual giant clumps , the measurements of their crucial parameters , in particular the mass - loading factors , is still very uncertain .",
    "it has been suggested in the recent literature that the migration of giant clumps to the centers of high - redshift galaxies may serve as an avenue for the formation of galaxy bulges , in addition to the more traditional avenue of galaxy mergers ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the alternative scenario we present in this paper , namely that giant clumps do not migrate to their galaxy centers , does not necessarily mean that bulges do not form secularly in high - redshift galaxy disks .",
    "the instabilities and irregularities we find in our simulated disks do induce internal torques and angular momentum loss , such that inflows to smaller radii inside the disks do occur . nevertheless , by comparing clump evolution with and without winds ,",
    "we demonstrate that secular bulge growth occurs much more slowly in the case where winds disrupt clumps .",
    "we reserve detailed studies of secular bulge formation under conditions of strong feedback and giant clump destruction , as well as implications for the global cosmic rate of bulge formation , to future work .",
