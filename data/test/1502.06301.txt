    "the measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations become increasingly important from the perspective of not only cosmology but also elementary particle physics .",
    "useful indicators of the cmb fluctuations are given by the scalar ( or density ) fluctuations , @xmath6 , the spectral index , @xmath0 , and the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath1 .",
    "in the inflation scenario a non - vanishing potential energy density of a scalar field induces exponential expansion on the universe .",
    "the origin of the cmb fluctuations is found in the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field .",
    "it is expected that these inflationary parameters restrict the models of particle physics .",
    "although we have observed only one elementary scalar field , i.e. higgs , it is quite natural to assume that other scalar fields exist and play a decisive role for the energy density and its fluctuation at early universe .    in this paper",
    "we consider that the inflaton field is a real scalar field with a quartic self - interaction and a non - minimal scalar - curvature interaction at high - energy scale and study a possible model consistent with the cmb fluctuations at the two loop level .",
    "inflation is thought to occur near the planck scale . in such high energy scale",
    "the quantum correction may have some remarkable effect on the inflationary parameters .",
    "it is known that the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio are independent of the scalar quartic coupling , @xmath3 , at the tree level .",
    "it is also known that there is an attractor on the @xmath7 plane .",
    "the inflationary parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , converge to their universal model - independent values at the large scalar - curvature coupling limit @xcite .",
    "note that rg behavior of scalar curvature coupling @xmath8 is defined by the behavior of the corresponding quantum field theory at high energy ( see : @xcite ) so that it maybe tend to large or small asymptotic value at high - energy limit .",
    "the inflationary parameters have been investigated up to the leading log level with respect to the scalar quartic coupling in ref .",
    "the quantum corrections introduce the quartic coupling dependence for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but do not alter the attractor behavior . the standard model ( sm ) higgs inflation has been investigated up to the next to leading log level in refs .",
    "@xcite . in sm the scalar quartic coupling",
    "is extremely suppressed near the planck scale .",
    "it has been pointed out that a large non - minimal scalar curvature coupling is necessary to reproduce the observed higgs mass , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "it is also interesting to note that the reconstruction of the inflationary scalar potential as is done in @xcite maybe applied to such non - minimal inflationary scalar potential .",

    "the de sitter solutions become unstable when the absolute values of the couplings decrease .    the behavior for @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 has been systematically evaluated as a function of the couplings , the renormalization scale and the e - folding number .",
    "it is found that the two - loop corrections on @xmath0 are larger than the leading - log corrections . besides",
    ", it is demonstrated that a larger @xmath3- and @xmath72-dependence of @xmath0 is observed as the scalar - curvature coupling , @xmath2 , increases .",
    "we have also observed a similar feature for @xmath2- , @xmath72- and @xmath5-dependence of @xmath1 . concretely the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath1 is suppressed with the growth of @xmath2 , @xmath72 and @xmath5 .",
    "the loop corrections introduce an unavoidable dependence on the renormalization scale .",
    "it is observed that the two - loop contribution is softened for @xmath94 .",
    "it should be noted that we can tune the couplings , @xmath3 and @xmath2 consistent with the current observational constraints for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in sm higgs inflation",
    "the quartic coupling vanishes near the planck scale @xcite .",
    "a small positive value of the non - minimal scalar curvature coupling is favored for a simple scalar quadratic potential @xcite .",
    "it has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite that there is an attractor in the @xmath98 plane at the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "we find that such attractor behavior does not appear in our model until @xmath90 .",
    "but the results seem to approach the attractor .",
    "there is a possibility that a larger @xmath2 is necessary to obviously observe the convergence to the attractor due to the quantum effects .",
    "it has been pointed that multi - field models with quartic self - couplings quickly relax to the single - field attractor for a wide range of couplings and initial conditions @xcite .",
    "thus it is interesting to extend our approach to multi - field models .",
    "it is mentioned that the formulation of scalar - tensor theories and the theoretical predictions depend on the choice of the frames , jordan or einstein frame @xcite .",
    "note that calculation of inflationary parameters and lyapunov stability may look to depend on the einstein or jordan frame under consideration .",
    "however , it has been proved in @xcite that the obtained inflationary parameters are just the same in both frames . in ref .",
    "@xcite the induced inflation models are revealed to have another attractor at the small @xmath2 limit .",
    "the radiative corrections may affect such a double attractor behavior .",
    "note finally that using same approach one can study non - minimal two - loop inflation for standard model .",
