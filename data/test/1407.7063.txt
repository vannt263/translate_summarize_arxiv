    "in the context of quantum information and quantum technology the idea of reading classical data by means of quantum states arises quite naturally  @xcite . in general",
    ", the standard implementations of reading are based on optical technologies : the task is the readout of a digital optical memory , where information is stored by means of the optical properties of the memory cells that are in turn probed by shining light , e.g. a laser beam , on them .",
    "the probing light is usually denoted as the _",
    "transmitter_. interesting features arise in the regime in which the transmitter has to be treated quantum mechanically .",
    "the maximum rate of reliable readout defines the quantum reading capacity  @xcite .",
    "the latter can overcome the classical reading capacity , obtained by probing with classical light , in several relevant settings .",
    "the ( possibly quantum ) transmitter that is needed to extract the encoded information is prepared in some initial state . by scanning a particular cell",
    "the transmitter changes its properties in a way depending on the cell .",
    "the task is to recognize which cell occurs based on the output state of the transmitter after it has been detected and measured .",
    "therefore the problem of reading reduces to the problem of distinguishing the output states of the transmitter .    in such optical settings one needs to consider two main coding protocols depending on the trade off between energy and coherence of the transmitters and the channels that are being used",
    "the first protocol is the so - called _ amplitude shift keying _ ( ask ) in which the changes in the state of the transmitter are caused by the cell - dependent losses in the intensity of the transmitted signal  @xcite .",
    "the second main protocol is the so - called _ phase shift keying _ ( psk )  @xcite .",
    "this is a type of coding which does not produce energy dissipation . on the other hand ,",
    "it requires a very high coherence of the transmitter , a feature that might be realized in realistic implementations  @xcite .",
    "if the transmitter is quantum , the cells play the role of effective quantum channels .",
    "the ask protocol then corresponds to a dissipative channel coding , while the psk protocol is a particular case of unitary coding corresponding to a unitary channel . within the ask protocol",
    ", it can be shown that in the low - energy regime there is an energy threshold above which the maximally entangled transmitter , i.e. a two - mode squeezed state , yields a better reading efficiency than any of the classical states with the same energy  @xcite .",
    "the general result is still valid in the presence of some noise - induced decoherence . within the ask protocol ,",
    "coding is then realized by local channels corresponding to cells with different reflectivities .    in the psk protocol ,",
    "the coding is realized by means of local unitary operations , specifically local phase shifts  @xcite . in the ideal , noise - free protocol",
    "the transmitter is taken to be in a pure gaussian quasi - bell state , i.e. a bell - type superposition of quasi - orthogonal coherent states . in this scheme ,",
    "the resulting quantum advantage is absolute , in the sense that quantum reading of the classical information encoded via a phase shift of @xmath0 is achieved with vanishing error , while any classical state of the transmitter always yields a finite error probability .    in both the ask and psk protocols",
    "the transmitter is assumed to be a bipartite system such that only one part of it scans the memory cell .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that it maximizes distinguishability at the output when the state of the transmitter is quantum .",
    "as already mentioned , the reading efficiency is characterized by the probability of error .",
    "information is encoded in binary memory cells with indices @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is thus written using only two local channels that are assumed to occur with equal _ a priori _ probabilities .",
    "given the bi - partite input transmitter @xmath3 , the two possible output states will be denoted by @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the probability of error in distinguishing the two output states when reading a memory cell by means of the same input @xmath3 is given by the well - known helstrom formula @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the trace distance , with @xmath8 .",
    "with our normalization convention , the trace distance ranges from @xmath1 to a maximum of @xmath9 for orthogonal pure states .    in the original reading protocols the goal is to minimize @xmath10 over the set of possible transmitter states @xmath3 at fixed encoding in the memory cells  @xcite .",
    "the problem is thus dependent on the type of memory device being used .    here",
    "instead we wish to provide a device - independent characterization of a given transmitter by considering the worst - case scenario that maximizes the probability of error @xmath10 over all possible codings .",
    "once the worst - case scenario is identified , one can then compare different classes of transmitter states to identify the ones that minimize the maximum probability of error @xmath11 .",
    "we will show that the maximum probability of error @xmath11 is a monotonically decreasing function of the amount of quantum correlations present in the transmitter state @xmath3 , as quantified by a recently introduced measure of quantum correlations , the so - called discord of response  @xcite in its gaussian version  @xcite ( for general reviews on quantum correlations and distinguishability of quantum states and on discord - like correlations see  @xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "every state with non - vanishing discord of response is able to read any type of memory device with maximal @xmath12 .",
    "on the other hand , for each classical transmitter , i.e. for transmitter with vanishing discord of response , there will always exist at least one memory device which is completely invisible , i.e. for which @xmath13 . in these considerations",
    "we exclude the situations when two channels are chosen to be arbitrarily similar . in this case",
    "the probability of error always approaches @xmath14 independently on the chosen transmitter .    in sec .",
    "[ errorprobdiscord ] we derive the exact analytical relation between the maximum probability of error and the gaussian discord of response . in sec .",
    "[ gausstrans ] we discuss the properties of classical and quantum gaussian transmitters , comparing squeezed - thermal , thermal - squeezed and coherent - thermal states ; in subsection [ gausstransa ] we derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum probability of error , and in subsection [ phaseshiftreading ] we identify the unitary coding that maximizes the quantum chernoff bound , namely the upper bound on the maximum probability of error , for the classes of quantum gaussian transmitters considered . the unitary channel which maximizes the bounds on the probability of error turns out to be a particular psk coding , namely the unique traceless one , which is realized for a @xmath15 phase shift .    in sec .",
    "[ comparisonclass ] we compare the performance of gaussian quantum states of light with classical states ( coherent thermal states ) .",
    "we show that strongly discordant squeezed thermal states possess a higher reading efficiency than the corresponding classical states of light , that is non - discordant gaussian coherent thermal transmitters with the same total number of photons ( fixed energy ) .",
    "this realizes an important instance of noise - enhanced quantum advantage over the corresponding noisy classical resources .    in sec .",
    "[ comparisonquant ] we compare different families of discordant gaussian states , the squeezed thermal and the thermal squeezed states at fixed total number of photons or squeezing . while for both classes of states the entanglement obviously decreases with increasing thermal noise ,",
    "we show that for squeezed thermal states the discord is an increasing function of the number of thermal photons at fixed squeezing , while the opposite holds for thermal squeezed states . moreover , for squeezed thermal transmitters , the quantum chernoff bound is independent of thermal noise . as a consequence ,",
    "this type of transmitter plays a privileged role in the considered class of quantum gaussian resources because the associated quantum efficiency is either enhanced or unaffected by increasing the thermal noise .",
    "thus squeezed thermal transmitters realize an instance of noise - enhanced or noise - independent quantum resources at fixed squeezing . both in the classical - to - quantum comparison and in the comparison of different quantum resources , the key enhancement of quantum advantage is realized in the situation of strongest asymmetry of the distribution of thermal noise among the field modes : _ local _ noise enhancement leads to _ global _ enhancement of quantum correlations .    the main results are summarized and some outlook perspectives for future work are discussed in sec .  [ summary ] .",
    "detailed calculations and auxiliary reasonings are reported in four appendixes .",
    "in protocols of quantum reading with unitary coding the two local channels acting on the input probe state @xmath3 are unitary , and denoted as @xmath16 and @xmath17 . therefore , in this type of protocol @xmath18 and @xmath19 , so that the probability of error reads @xmath20 since the trace norm is invariant under local unitary transformations , one has equivalently @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is still a local unitary transformation acting on the transmitted subsystem @xmath24 .",
    "the absolute upper bound for the probability of error is thus @xmath14 , corresponding to a situation in which there is no way to distinguish the two output states and therefore the memory device becomes completely invisible to the transmitter .",
    "in general , computing the trace distance proves to be extremely challenging  @xcite , even more so for gaussian states of infinite - dimensional continuous - variable systems  @xcite .",

    "we have discussed two fundamental classes of gaussian quantum transmitters : symmetric squeezed thermal states ( stss ) and symmetric thermal squeezed states ( tsss ) .",
    "we have shown that the actual beneficial or detrimental effects of environmental noise depend on the type of quantum state being considered .",
    "considering stss as quantum transmitters , the upper and lower bounds on the probability of error decrease with increasing thermal noise and therefore the quantum reading efficiency increases .",
    "the opposite behavior is observed when considering tsss : in this case both the upper and the lower bounds on the maximum probability of error increase and therefore the quantum reading efficiency decreases with increasing thermal noise .",
    "finally , we went a step further and investigated the use of non - symmetric stss .",
    "for such transmitters , also the quantum chernoff bound decreases when the local thermal noise increases in one mode and remains fixed in the second mode .",
    "indeed , the quantum chernoff bound vanishes asymptotically with very large local thermal noise and therefore the probability of error must also vanish .",
    "in other words , non - symmetric two - mode stss with imbalanced thermal noise between the two modes achieve an asymptotically vanishing probability of error for very large values of the noise imbalance . for such asymptotic states",
    "the hellinger and bures gaussian discords of response attain their maximum value , and the quantum chernoff bound and uhlmann fidelity vanish . as a consequence ,",
    "all upper and lower bounds on the probability of error vanish , the probability of error itself vanishes , and perfect reading is approached asymptotically .",
    "since the quantum reading efficiency of non - symmetric two - mode squeezed thermal states is a non - decreasing function of thermal noise , there is no evident advantage in using pure - state squeezed transmitters , the two - mode squeezed vacuum states , or low - noise ones over non - symmetric two - mode stss with large noise imbalance between the field modes , _ as long as _ the squeezing is kept _",
    "fixed _ at a realistic , finite constant value achievable in concrete experiments with currently available technology .",
    "hence , noisy stss transmitters _ can _ provide a better quantum efficiency at _ fixed _ two - mode squeezing , provided thermal noise ( number of thermal photons ) is enhanced beyond the threshold value above which the upper bound on the probability of error ( quantum chernoff bound ) for stss goes below the exact probability of error for tmsvss with the same , fixed level of squeezing .",
    "this remarkable phenomenon of noise - assisted quantum correlations and quantum efficiency is eventually due to the fact that quantum state distinguishability is intimately related to the concept of geometric quantum correlations , as measured by the discords of response , and the observation that the former can increase under increasing thermal noise . in particular , maximum _ local _",
    "noise enhancement leads to maximum _ global _ enhancement of quantum correlations .",
    "in forthcoming studies we will provide a general characterization and quantification of noise - suppressed vs. noise - enhanced quantum correlations for different classes of quantum states  @xcite , and we will investigate the relations between different types of quantum correlations according to states , metrics , and operations  @xcite .",
