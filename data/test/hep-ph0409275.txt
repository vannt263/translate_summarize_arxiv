    "rare b  decays induced by the flavor  changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath1 have received a lot of theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "these transitions provide an important consistency check of the standard model ( sm ) at loop level , since fcnc transitions are forbidden in the sm at tree level .",

    "decays , the last decay channels are very significant , since they are theoretically , more or less , clean , and they have relatively larger branching ratio .",
    "the semileptonic decay channels is described by the @xmath1 transition and they contain many observables like forward  backward asymmetry @xmath2 , lepton polarization asymmetries , etc .",

    "there exist regions of the new wilson coefficients @xmath26 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where double  lepton polarization asymmetries differ from the sm result , but branching ratio coincides with that of the sm .    at the end of this section ,",
    "let us discuss the problem of measurement of the lepton polarization asymmetries in experiments .",
    "experimentally , to measure an asymmetry @xmath119 of the decay with the branching ratio @xmath120 at @xmath121 level , the required number of events ( i.e. , the number of @xmath122 pair ) are given by the expression n =  , where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the efficiencies of the leptons .",

    "we see that , in order to observe the lepton polarization asymmetries in @xmath113 and @xmath112 decays at @xmath130 level , the minimum number of required events are ( for the efficiency of @xmath125lepton we take @xmath131 ) :    * for the @xmath113 decay n = \\ { + ll 2.0 10 ^ 6 & ( p_ll )  , + 2.0 10 ^ 8 & ( p_lt = p_tl , p_nn , p_tt )  , + .",
    "* for @xmath112 decay n = \\ { + ll ( 4.0 2 ) 10 ^ 9 & ( p_lt , p_nn )  , + ( 1.0 0.5 ) 10 ^ 9 & ( p_tt )  , + ( 2.0 1.0 ) 10 ^ 11 & ( p_ln , p_nl )  , + ( 9.0 4.5 ) 10 ^ 8 & ( p_tl )  .",
    "the number of @xmath122 pairs , that are produced at b  factories and lhc are about @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively . as a result of a comparison of these numbers and @xmath61 ,",
    "we conclude that , only @xmath134 in the @xmath135 decay and @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 in the @xmath112 decay , can be detectable at lhc .    in summary , we present the most general analysis of the double  lepton polarization asymmetries in the @xmath139 decay using the most general , model independent form of the effective hamiltonian .",
