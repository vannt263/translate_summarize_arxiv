    "staggered fermions preserve enough chiral symmetry to prevent those operators of our physical interest from mixing with operators of wrong chirality and to protect quark mass from additive renormalization .",
    "this chiral symmetry is essential to calculate @xmath3 .",
    "staggered fermions have the advantages over dwf of requiring less computing time and dynamical simulations are already possible with relatively light quark masses .    by construction ,",
    "staggered fermions possess four degenerate flavors ( also called `` tastes '' ) .",
    "they allow large taste changing quark - gluon interactions , which make the perturbative correction large even at the one loop level .",
    "in addition , four - fermion operator mixing matrix is huge ( @xmath4 ) , which makes it impractical to determine the matching coefficients in a completely non - perturbative way .",
    "another disadvantage is that the unimproved staggered fermion action and operators receive large perturbative corrections @xcite and have large scaling violations of order @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "both of these disadvantages can be alleviated by improving staggered fermions using fat links .",
    "it has been shown that taste symmetry breaking in the pion spectrum is significantly reduced with fat links @xcite .",
    "the first goal of this staggered @xmath3 project is to check the results ( @xmath6 ) obtained using quenched domain wall fermions ( dwf ) by cp - pacs @xcite and rbc collaboration @xcite .",
    "the second goal is to extend the calculation to dynamical simulation .",
    "the main goal is to find a window for new physics or to confirm the standard model , when our numerical results are compared with the experimental results .",
    "this project has progressed through the following small steps .",
    "since the penguin diagrams had already been known for the gauge invariant operators from @xcite , we calculated the remaining diagrams of the current - current type @xcite .",
    "this provided a complete set of matching formula for @xmath3 , combined with the existing results for penguin diagrams @xcite .",
    "we also observed that the perturbative correction for some of the operators such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are so large that the uncertainty from the truncated contribution is of order 100% for using unimproved staggered fermions .",
    "using unimproved staggered fermions , we performed a numerical study on @xmath3 . using the matching formula given in @xcite , we constructed fully one loop matched gauge invariant operators . as expected , we found large perturbative corrections for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , so that we can not quote quantitative results for this although the statistical uncertainties are under control .",
    "we also observed that different quenching transcriptions of the continuum operators on the lattice ( proposed by golterman and pallante @xcite lead to noticeably different values for @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this indicates a large quenching uncertainty , which deserves further investigation .",
    "hence , it was essential to reduce the large perturbative correction by improving the staggered fermions . hence , the main goal was to find an improvement scheme which can reduce the perturbative correction down to 10% or less . in order to find the best scheme , we calculated , explicitly , one loop matching coefficients for various improved staggered actions and operators @xcite : 1 ) fat7 , 2 ) fat7+lepage , 3 ) hyp and 4 ) asqtad - like ( fat7+lepage+naik ) actions .",
    "we observe that all the above improvement schemes significantly reduce the size of matching coefficients .",
    "after the second level of mean - field improvement , the hyp and fat7 links lead to the smallest one - loop corrections @xcite .",
    "since the hyp fat link reduces the non - perturbative flavor symmetry breaking more efficiently in the pion spectrum than the fat7 link , we adopted the hyp scheme in our numerical study .",
    "we studied further on the hyp link @xcite .",
    "the hyp links possess some universal properties , which are summarized in the following 5 theorems .",
    "any fat link can be expanded in powers of gauge fields ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xmath14    1 .   the linear term , @xmath15 is invariant under su(3 ) projection .",
    "2 .   the quadratic term , @xmath16 is antisymmetric in gauge fields .",
    "[ theorem : su(3 ) ]    1 .   at one loop level",
    ", only the @xmath15 term contributes to the renormalization of the gauge - invariant staggered fermion operators .",
    "2 .   at one loop level , the contribution from @xmath17 for any @xmath18 vanishes .",
    "3 .   at one loop level ,",
    "the renormalization of the gauge - invariant staggered operators can be done by simply replacing the propagator of the @xmath13 field by that of the @xmath15 field .",
    "this theorem is true , regardless of details of the smearing transformation .",
    "[ theorem : renorm ]    1 .",
    "the linear gauge field term @xmath15 in the perturbative expansion is universal . 2 .",
    "in general , the quadratic terms may be different from one another .",
    "but all of them are antisymmetric in gauge fields .",
    "this theorem is true , regardless of the details of smearing .",
    "[ theorem : multi - su(3 ) ]    if we impose the perturbative improvement condition of removing the flavor changing interactions on the hyp action , the hyp link satisfies the following :    1 .",
    "the linear term @xmath15 in perturbative expansion is identical to that of the su(3 ) projected fat7 links .",
    "the quadratic term @xmath16 is antisymmetric in gauge fields .",
    "[ theorem : unique ]    if we impose the perturbative improvement condition to remove the flavor changing interactions , at one loop level ,    1 .",
    "the renormalization of the gauge invariant staggered operators is identical between the hyp staggered action and those improved staggered actions made of the su(3 ) projected fat7 links ( often called `` @xmath12 '' ) , 2 .",
    "the contribution to the one - loop renormalization can be obtained by simply replacing the propagator of @xmath13 by that of @xmath15 .",
    "[ theorem : equivalence ]    the first two theorems were used in @xcite and @xcite , although they did not present their derivation . for derivations of all five theorems and further details ,",
    "refer to @xcite . as a result of these theorems",
    ", we can prove that for each feynman diagram , @xmath19 here , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) represents perturbative corrections to gauge - invariant staggered operators constructed using su(3 ) projected fat links ( thin links ) .",
    "this inequality is not valid for those fat links without su(3 ) projection .",
    "hence , this lead to a conclusion that we may view the su(3 ) projection of fat links as a tool of tadpole improvement for the staggered fermion doublers  @xcite . we also present alternative choices of constructing fat links to improve staggered fermions in  @xcite .",
    "the above five theorems make the perturbative calculation simpler for the hyp scheme , because one can perform the calculation merely by replacing the thin link propagator with that of the hyp links .",
    "this simplicity is extensively used in calculating the renormalization constants of the four - fermion operators in the next stage .",
    ".one - loop correction to @xmath22 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to obtain a complete set of matching formula to convert the lattice results into continuum values , we need to calculate the penguin diagrams for the gauge - invariant staggered operators constructed using various fat links @xcite .",
    "one of the main results regarding the diagonal mixing from penguin diagrams can be summarized into the following theorem :    * theorem 1 ( equivalence ) * + _ at the one loop level , the diagonal mixing coefficients of penguin diagrams are identical between ( a ) the unimproved ( naive ) staggered operators constructed using the thin links and ( b ) the improved staggered operators constructed using the fat links such as hyp ( i ) , hyp ( ii ) , fat7 , fat7+lepage , and @xmath23_.    the details on the proof of this theorem will be given in @xcite .    by construction ,",
    "gluons carrying a momentum close to @xmath24 are physical in staggered fermions and lead to taste changing interactions , which is a pure lattice artifact . in the case of unimproved staggered fermions",
    ", it is allowed to mix with wrong taste ( @xmath25 ) and the mixing coefficient is substantial .",
    "in contrast , in the case of improved staggered fermions using fat links of our interest such as fat7 , @xmath12 and hyp ( ii ) , the off - diagonal mixing with wrong taste vanishes and is absent . in the case of the improvement using hyp ( i ) and fat7 + lepage",
    ", the off - diagonal mixing with wrong taste is significantly suppressed .",
    "the details of this off - diagonal mixing will be given in @xcite .",
    "recently we have performed a numerical study using columbia qcdsp supercomputer with the hyp ( ii ) staggered fermion . since we know the complete set of matching formula for hyp/@xmath12 staggered operators from @xcite , we constructed fully one - loop matched gauge - invariant operators to study @xmath3 . here , we present preliminary estimates of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 calculated using the hyp ( ii ) staggered fermions at @xmath30 on a @xmath31 lattice with 218 configurations .",
    "[ fig : b_k ] shows @xmath26 as a function of @xmath32 , where the mesons are made of degenerate quarks .",
    "we fit @xmath26 to the form suggested by quenched chiral perturbation theory @xcite : @xmath33 . the cross symbol in fig .",
    "1 corresponds to the value interpolated to the physical kaon mass .",
    "our preliminary result is @xmath34 , which is consistent with the continuum extrapolated value calculated using unimproved staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "however , our value is substantially different from the value ( @xmath35 ) calculated using unimproved staggered fermions at finite lattice spacing ( @xmath36 gev ) .",
    "therefore , this leads to the preliminary conclusion that , using the hyp staggered fermions , the scaling behavior is so improved that our results at @xmath37 ( @xmath38 gev ) is already in agreement with the continuum extrapolated values of the unimproved staggered results .",
    "of course , this claim needs further investigation at weaker couplings . in the chiral limit ,",
    "we obtain @xmath39 , which is also consistent with those results obtained using the nlo , large @xmath40 calculation @xcite .",
    "the value for @xmath41 is consistent with the predictions of quenched chiral perturbation theory @xcite within large errors .",
    "a major contribution to the @xmath1 amplitudes comes from @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we fit @xmath27 and @xmath28 to the form of our trial function : @xmath42 .",
    "the results of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : b_7:lin+log ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : b_8:lin+log ] , respectively .",
    "our preliminary values at the physical kaon mass are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we also fit @xmath27 and @xmath28 to the form suggested by the quenched chiral perturbation @xcite : @xmath45 .",
    "these fitting results of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b_7:lin ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : b_8:lin ] , respectively .",
    "our preliminary values at the physical kaon mass from these fits are @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "hence , we observe not only that the interpolated values at the physical kaon mass are insensitive to the fitting functions , but also that the extrapolated values in the chiral limit are extremely sensitive to the fitting functions .",
    "we can think of two possibilities for the chiral extrapolation .",
    "one possibility is that the data point at the lightest quark mass might be shifted due to a finite volume effect , which certainly need further investigation in near future .",
    "another possibility is that the truncated higher order corrections from the quenched chiral perturbation theory are not negligible so that we might have to include higher order terms to do better chiral extrapolation . for these reasons",
    ", we do not quote our values for @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the chiral limit but we only quote the values interpolated to the physical kaon mass as above .    note that we calculated @xmath27 at the scale @xmath48 using the hyp staggered fermions , which would not have been meaningful for unimproved staggered fermions due to large perturbative corrections .",
    "compared with previous calculation done using landau - gauge operators @xcite , the systematics of the hyp staggered operators are significantly reduced and the results are as much more reliable .      a major contribution to @xmath2 amplitudes comes from @xmath29 .",
    "there are two independent methods to calculate @xmath29 in ( partially ) quenched qcd : the standard ( std ) method and the golterman - pallante ( gp ) method @xcite .",
    "first , we fit @xmath29 to the form suggested by the quenched chiral perturbation theory @xcite : @xmath49 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : b_6:lin+log ] .",
    "our preliminary values at the physical kaon mass are @xmath50 where @xmath38 gev , set by the @xmath51 meson mass .",
    "we also fit @xmath29 to another form suggested by the quenched chiral perturbation @xcite : @xmath52 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : b_6:lin ] .",
    "our preliminary values at the physical kaon mass from this fit are @xmath53 as in the case of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we observe that the extrapolated values in the chiral limit are extremely sensitive to the fitting function choice . at present , we can not exclude the possibility that the data point at the lightest quark mass could be shifted due to a finite volume effect ( in the @xmath54 region of the chiral perturbation theory ) .",
    "it is also possible that truncated higher order corrections from the quenched chiral perturbation theory are so significant that we might have to include these neglected terms for chiral extrapolation .",
    "therefore , we can not quote our values of @xmath55 in the chiral limit .",
    "note that unlike the unimproved staggered fermion calculations where the perturbative corrections to the std calculation are @xmath56 , the perturbative corrections in this calculation are modest for both the std and gp methods .",
    "we also observe that the gap between the std and gp methods is reduced at the physical kaon mass using the hyp staggered fermions compared that of the unimproved staggered fermions .",
    "we use the formula provided in @xcite to convert @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 at @xmath60 gev into @xmath3 .",
    "as mentioned before , we have two different methods to calculate @xmath29 in quenched qcd : the std and gp methods .",
    "when we use the std method for @xmath61 , we obtain @xmath62 . for the gp method for @xmath58",
    ", we obtain @xmath63 .",
    "these values are very preliminary and we have not included an analysis of the systematic errors .",
    "in addition , we did not use lattice values for any @xmath64 except for @xmath29 since we have not yet extracted them .",
    "we plan to calculate all the @xmath65 and incorporate all of them into the calculation of @xmath3 .",
    "we also plan to obtain the optimal matching scale , @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we plan to extend our calculation to dynamical simulation .",
    "current calculation of @xmath3 uses the leading order chiral perturbation results to convert @xmath67 and @xmath68 amplitudes into @xmath69 amplitudes . in principle",
    ", it is possible to calculate @xmath69 amplitudes directly on the lattice .",
    "a number of attempts in this direction have been tried @xcite .",
    "there has been a numerical study on @xmath12 as a new fat link computationally cheaper than the hyp link , while preserving all the nice features of the hyp link @xcite .",
