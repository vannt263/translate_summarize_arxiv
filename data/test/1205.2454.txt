    "such description has the advantage of accounting for individual cell properties using only a few spatially averaged parameters , which determine for instance how fast and through which succession of states the domain reacts to external solicitations",

    "the continuous description applies to other cellular materials such as foams  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we investigate experimentally whether it also applies to epithelial tissues .",
    "more specifically , we ask whether the epithelium strain , stress and material properties can be directly measured on a mesoscopic scale .",
    "we address these questions in a model system , the dorsal thorax epithelium of _ drosophila _ pupa .",
    "the pupa is the life stage during which the larva starves , feeds upon its reserves and metamorphoses into an adult @xcite .",

    "it is composed of a large anterior region , the scutum , and a posterior tip , the scutellum .",
    "the thorax , and especially the scutellum , undergoes extensive morphogenetic changes during the metamorphosis that shapes the adult fly ( figure  [ fig : metamorphosis ] ( a ) ) , making it a useful model to decipher the mechanisms that control tissue morphogenesis during development @xcite .",

    "we include three experiments performed in the scutum ( black cross in figure  [ fig : metamorphosis ] ( a ) ) of middle - aged ( @xmath16 ) and old ( @xmath17 ) pupae .",
    "we analyse the retraction of the inner tissue domain and its margin , within the set of assumptions relevant for the retraction of a single severed cell - junction .",
    "the boundary of the retracting domain is fitted at each time point by an ellipse @xcite ( see methods and figure  [ fig : fit_ellipse ] ( c - d ) ) , yielding values of the @xmath4 and @xmath0 axes as a function of time ( figure  [ fig : tau_x_vs_v ] ) .",
    "our protocol offers several advantages .",
    "( i ) the experiment directly yields measurements averaged over the severed tissue domain , comprising typically a hundred of cells . as discussed below",
    ", the domain size is thus an adequate mesoscopic scale , crossing - over from detailed cell - level to tissue - level continuous descriptions @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the comparison between the initial and final states yields a direct measurement of the strain which existed before severing .",
    "( iii ) several cell - cell junctions in various directions are severed at once ( rather than step by step ) and in the same pupa .",
    "hence one experiment yields a direct measurement of all stress to viscosity tensor components .",
    "it takes only a few tens of seconds , the typical value of the relaxation time .",
    "( iv ) last but not least , by isolating in time and space an epithelium domain from its neighboring cells , we obtain a complete set of well - defined initial , boundary and final conditions for a spatio - temporal model of the retracting domain . we thus introduce a continuous model , in the spirit of mayer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and taking into account a coupling between space and time dependences .",
    "as explained below , fitting such a model to the displacements in the domain bulk tests the continuous description , suggests an interpretation of the relaxation time , and probes the competition between internal viscosity and external friction .",
    "model - independent measurement of strain @xmath18 , stress to viscosity ratio @xmath9 , and relaxation time @xmath7 .",
    "the wound margin position ( ellipse semi - axis ) is plotted _ versus _ time after severing ; data from figure  [ fig : fit_ellipse ] ( b - d ) , esm movie 1 , along the @xmath0 axis .",
    "the difference between the initial ( @xmath19 ) and final ( @xmath20 ) positions ( blue dashed lines ) directly yields the value of @xmath21 .",
    "the initial velocity @xmath22 ( slope of the orange dashed line ) yields an estimate of @xmath23 .",
    "inset : velocity , estimated by finite differences of successive positions , _ versus _ the position during the first @xmath24 s. an arrow indicates the direction of increasing time @xmath25 .",
    "the slope of a linear fit ( purple line ) yields the inverse of the relaxation time , @xmath26 ( see equation  [ eq : measure_tau ] ) . ]",
    "severing the epithelium reveals the displacement that the epithelium would spontaneously undergo if it were free .",
    "we measure the strain using a logarithmic definition @xcite , hencky s  true strain \" @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath19 is the initial radius , and @xmath28 is the ellipse semi - axis at the end of the relaxation .",
    "similarly @xmath29 .",
    "the advantages of this definition are that @xcite : it is valid at all amplitudes ; it is adapted for tensorial measurements ; and finally it increases the range of validity of the linear elasticity approximation which applies here even to the highest strain value we measure , @xmath30 .",
    "each severing is followed by a relaxation to a final domain strictly smaller than the initial disk ( figure  [ fig : fit_ellipse ] ( d ) ) , indicating that before the severing the tissue had a positive strain in all directions .",
    "since the midline is a symmetry axis , we expect that the strain axes are parallel and perpendicular to it .",
    "we check that this is the case for the fitted ellipse axes , and that accordingly the shear strain @xmath31 is indistinguishable from 0 .",
    "we thus plot @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( figure  [ fig : strain_anisotropy ] ( a ) ) , obtained with absolute precision better than @xmath34 .",
    "the values are clustered according to the three pupa age groups : @xmath18 is low and isotropic at young age ( green cluster ) , moderate and isotropic at middle age ( red ) , high and anisotropic ( @xmath35 ) at old age ( blue ) .",
    "similarly , in each experiment , the initial retraction of the wound margins ( figure  [ fig : fit_ellipse ] ( c ) ) indicates the sign of the stress : before the severing the tissue was under tensile stress in all directions .",
    "this is reminiscent of positive cell junction tensions observed in the wing @xcite and in the notum @xcite .",
    "the initial retraction velocity divided by @xmath19 yields the stress to viscosity ratio @xmath9 ( figure  [ fig : tau_x_vs_v ] ) , in a way which is likely to be independent of any tissue rheological model , as suggested by the following argument .",
    "when ablating a single cell - cell junction , force balance shows that the force @xmath36 exerted by the ablated junction on the neighbouring vertex is proportional to the initial recoil velocity @xmath37 : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a friction coefficient @xcite .",
    "coarse - graining this relation , and assuming that the main source of dissipation is identical in our experiments which sever many junctions at once , yields @xmath40 , where the factor @xmath19 is introduced by dimensional analysis .",
    "results for the stress to viscosity ratio @xmath9 ( figure  [ fig : sigma_anisotropy ] ( b ) ) are similar to those for @xmath18 : its amplitude and anisotropy are initially small and increase with age ; the values are clustered according to the three age groups ; no shear stress is detected .",
    "values of @xmath9 span almost two decades , reflecting the sensitivity and precision of the method .",
    "the relaxation time , @xmath7 , is obtained from the time evolution of the ellipse axes . instead of fitting an exponential to the data , we plot the velocity _ versus _ position ( inset of figure  [ fig : tau_x_vs_v ] ) .",
    "this method is robust and independent of any assumption . a linear regression of the velocity as a function of position yields a slope of @xmath41 , as seen , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the equation : @xmath42 we find that the relaxation time is approximately isotropic ( esm figure  3 ( a ) ) and use @xmath43 as an estimate of @xmath7 .",

    "spatially averaging their positions by binning them into 8 equal - size bins improves the signal to noise ratio .",
    "we obtain the initial velocity profile _ versus _ position ( figure  [ fig : fit : xi ] ) . for old pupae ,",
    "it is spatially linear ; for middle - aged pupae it is spatially nonlinear ; in the young pupae , immediately after severing only the boundaries move significantly .    to account for these observations ,",
    "we formulate a spatio - temporal , viscoelastic , kelvin - voigt model in one dimension of space , where the coordinate @xmath51 denotes either @xmath4 or @xmath0 , and @xmath25 denotes time after severing ( see esm ) .",
    "thanks to the definition ( [ eq : def : hencky ] ) , the strain @xmath52 is related without approximation to the velocity @xmath53 through : @xmath54 we model the effect of friction of the epithelium against the hemolymph and the cuticle as an external fluid friction with coefficient @xmath55 .",
    "we find that when internal viscosity dominates , the strain remains uniform and all parts of the tissue relax exponentially with the same viscoelastic relaxation time @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the young modulus ( esm figure  4 ( a ) ) .",
    "when external friction dominates , strain diffuses from the boundaries with a diffusion coefficient @xmath58 and remains thus inhomogeneous at times @xmath25 smaller than @xmath59 ( esm figure  4 ( b ) ) . in the general case ,",
    "the dynamical equation for the strain field @xmath60 reads : @xmath61 with the conditions @xmath62 initially , @xmath63 at boundaries , and @xmath64 at the end .",
    "the relative importance of external friction _ versus _ internal viscosity is quantified by the dimensionless parameter : @xmath65 solving equation  [ eq : general : d ] at short time and integrating over space equation  [ eq : velocity_strain ] at @xmath66 yields the initial velocity profile : @xmath67 whose curvature is controlled by @xmath48 .",

    ", we check that the values @xmath68 and @xmath69 determined in the directions @xmath4 and @xmath0 are roughly consistent ( esm figure  3 ( b ) ) : we thus use @xmath70 as an estimate of @xmath48 .",
    "we find that @xmath48 varies more than @xmath7 ( figure  [ tau_vs_logxi ] ( c ) , horizontal axis ) .",
    "the middle aged group is characterized by intermediate values of @xmath48 ( figure  [ fig : fit : xi ] , red ) , of order of 10 . according to equation  [ eq : def : xibar ]",
    ", this indicates a possible effect of the external friction on the relaxation for scales larger than @xmath71 m . for both other age groups ,",
    "the values of @xmath48 should be considered as bounds on the order of magnitude .",
    "for old pupae we find @xmath72 smaller than a few times unity ( figure  [ fig : fit : xi ] , blue ) .",
    "for young pupae , we find @xmath72 larger than a few tens or hundred ( figure  [ fig : fit : xi ] , green ) .",
    "this model depends on three parameters measured independently of each other : the initial strain @xmath73 , the viscoelastic time @xmath7 , and the friction to viscosity ratio @xmath48 . to validate the model , we use it to numerically compute the whole space - time map of strains and displacements",
    "we simulate each experiment using the values of @xmath7 and @xmath48 measured as described above .",

    "conversely _ external _ degrees of freedom ( such as cell - cell rearrangements or cell divisions ) would have much larger viscoelastic times : in cell aggregates they are typically of order of several hours @xcite .",
    "the time scales of morphogenesis in this tissue are also of order of hours @xcite , as observed in other tissues as well , such as the _ drosophila _ pupal wing @xcite",
    ". indeed continuous models of morphogenetic processes presuppose the existence of such a separation of time scales .    the present experimental data are well described assuming that a single viscoelastic time is relevant .",
    "other experiments display a wide distribution of viscoelastic times @xcite : the model can easily be modified so as to take this feature into account .",
    "note that in the presence of friction the model already predicts that different parts of the severed domain relax at different rates ( esm figure  4 ( b ) ) .",
    "measurements of @xmath18 , @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath48 are performed as averages over the severed disk .",
    "the requirements on the averaging scale are that it should be ( i ) large enough to obtain a sufficient signal to noise ratio yielding significant results , and ( ii ) small enough to be able to focus simultaneously on the whole severed ring despite the epithelium surface curvature which is observed in old pupae . the @xmath81 symmetry with respect to the midline observed in figures  [ fig : fit_ellipse ] ( b - d ) , [ fig : fit : xi ] , and [ boxtraj ] acts as a control of the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the experimentally available range of scales corresponds to 60 - 100 cell areas , in other words the semi - axis length @xmath19 corresponds to 4 - 5 cell diameters .",
    "for old pupae , scales smaller than @xmath19 are also probed , corresponding to the scale of bins ( at least @xmath82 or @xmath83 , see figs .",
    "[ fig : fit : xi ] and [ boxtraj ] ) .",
    "we experimentally determine the order of magnitude of the dimensionless friction to viscosity ratio , @xmath48 ( figure  [ tau_vs_logxi ] ( c ) , horizontal axis ) .",
    "obtaining more precise values of @xmath48 would depend on model ingredients , such as depth of ablation along the apico - basal axis , detailed cell geometry , tissue compressibility , or type of friction .    for simplicity",
    "we have modeled by a fluid friction @xcite the dissipation on either surfaces of the epithelium , namely the hemolymph at basal side and the cuticle at apical side .",
    "we do not observe any threshold effect due to solid friction , and the agreement between model and data justifies _ a posteriori _ our assumption .    for young pupae ,",
    "the initial velocity field is not significantly higher than the noise level ( figure  [ fig : fit : xi ] , green ) . in this age group",
    ", it can not be used to validate the model , and the estimate of @xmath48 strongly depends on the motion of domain parts located close to the boundary ( equation  [ eq : vinit ] ) .      in the dorsal thorax",
    ", the severed domain fulfills the theoretical requirements for a continuous description : it contains a number of cells much larger than one ( large enough to allow for averaging ) , while being much smaller than the total number of cells in the whole tissue .    one could ask whether averages at scale @xmath19 are meaningful , due to variation of cell properties from cell to cell .",
    "we speculate that if heterogeneities within the domain dominated the average , the domain boundary could in principle adopt any arbitrary shape compatible with the @xmath81 symmetry .",
    "however , in practice , we observe that the domain boundary at the beginning , as well as at the end , of the relaxation also displays a @xmath84 symmetry ( figure  [ fig : fit_ellipse ] ( b - d ) and movies 1 - 3 ) and can be fitted by an ellipse : this is consistent with the measurements of @xmath9 and @xmath18 as tensors averaged over scale @xmath19 .",
    "limits of our model lie in its simplifications : one dimensional treatment , linear elasticity and viscosity , isotropy and homogeneity of material parameters including friction , identical properties of all cells contained in the severed region .",
    "however , the agreement between model and experiment is already good , and validates these approximations _ a posteriori_. we emphasize that one major goal of this model is to provide an order of magnitude of the friction to viscosity ratio @xmath48 .",
    "we do not claim that this model is unique , nor that it is general . in the future we hope to further test the model ingredients and relevance on this epithelium and other quasi - planar ones .",
    "since its ingredients are general , we expect our model to be of broad relevance when studying the relaxation of quasi - planar epithelia over similar time and length scales .",
    "however , the simplifications involved deserve further comments . in fact , completely different hypotheses could also be invoked to explain the spatial non - linearity in the velocity profile observed for young and middle - aged pupae .",
    "for instance , the viscous component of biological tissues could be a non - linear function of time , strain , and strain rate @xcite .",
    "a strain - dependent viscosity coefficient may lead to a non - linear velocity profile without the need to invoke any external friction .",
    "alternatively , a spatially heterogeneous friction might also explain the observed velocity profiles .",
    "since a linear velocity profile is observed in older pupae , the amplitude of these additional , more complex ingredients would have to decrease strongly during development .",
    "we believe that our model has the merit of simplicity .",
    "it successfully accounts for the description of the velocity profiles at any time .",
    "each of its hypotheses could be tested experimentally and , if experimental results require it , hypotheses could be relaxed to lead to more detailed explorations .",
    "we expect that additional ingredients could strongly affect the value of @xmath48 , but that other measurements presented here ( namely @xmath18 , @xmath9 and @xmath7 ) should be robust .",
    "the model thus provides a flexible and robust route to a mechanical description of quasi - planar epithelia .",
    "building upon classical single - junction laser ablations , our experiments enable to measure the time evolution of the mechanical state ( strain , and stress to viscosity ratio ) and material properties ( relaxation time , and friction to viscosity ratio ) during pupa metamorphosis , as well as their anisotropy .",
    "this provides relevant ingredients for the modeling of a tissue as a continuous , linear , viscoelastic material .",
    "moreover , our approach provides a method to explore the biological causality of the observed properties , by analysing mutant phenotypes or by micro - injecting drugs .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath7 would be affected by low doses of drugs known to modify cytoskeletal rheology such as cytochalasin d @xcite , ck-666 @xcite , y-27632 @xcite which respectively inhibit actin polymerization , arp2/3 complex activity or rho - kinase activity .",
    "we anticipate that modulating cell - cell adhesion by knock - down of e - cadherin or catenins @xcite could affect the viscosity .",
    "although we can not modulate the cell - cuticle adhesion , we could tune cell - matrix adhesion by knock - down of integrin or its linker to the cytoskeleton @xcite to affect the friction and thereby modify @xmath48 .    in principle , by establishing a complete map of @xmath8 at different positions , one could determine the length scale at which @xmath8 varies within the tissue , and check _ a posteriori _ whether it is larger than the scale @xmath19 used to measure @xmath8 .",
    "however , the present experiments measure the stress up to a dissipative prefactor , the tissue viscosity .",
    "similarly , single cell - junction ablation experiments measure force up to a prefactor ( a friction coefficient ) , rarely discussed or measured in the literature . to separate the stress and viscosity variations , alternative methods to directly measure forces and viscosities in live epithelia",
    "are thus called for .",
    "these include the measurement of cell junction tensions from movies observations @xcite , where the unknown prefactor , namely the average tension over the whole image , is by definition the same for all junctions .",
    "external mechanical manipulation @xcite yields direct determination of out - of - plane elastic and/or viscous moduli , but the in - plane moduli are only indirectly determined .",
    "another possible strategy could rely on microrheology @xcite : either passive , by tracking the brownian diffusion of beads within the cells ; or active , by moving ( magnetically or optically ) a bead back and forth within a cell at a specified frequency .",
    "such measurements could yield a direct access to the value of @xmath10 , but at the intracellular level .",
    "measuring @xmath10 at the scale of several cells either directly , or indirectly by measuring @xmath57 and @xmath7 and using the relation @xmath85 , could probably be possible , but we are not aware yet of a published method .",
    "since @xmath18 is a dimensionless geometrical quantity , its value is insensitive to cell size : the observed @xmath117-fold increase in @xmath18 can not be related to changes of cell size over time .",
    "it should involve other causes , that remain to be determined .",
    "part of the measured increase in @xmath9 values may be due to cell divisions which decrease the average cell area by a factor of @xmath86 between young and old pupae .",
    "the observed increase is a factor of @xmath87 , and thus should involve other causes as well .",
    "one candidate is a decrease of the tissue viscosity @xmath10 .",
    "however the near constancy of the viscoelastic time would then imply a corresponding increase in tissue elasticity , a rather unlikely coincidence .",
    "we therefore expect that stronger tensile forces are at work in the tissue in older pupae . from 18 hours apf onwards , the lateral part of the scutellum undergoes apical cell contractions that shape the lateral domain of the tissue @xcite .",
    "this observation led us to divide the ablation experiments into the three age groups .",
    "it may also explain the changes in mechanical properties measured in the tissue for middle - aged and old pupae . to precisely analyse the causes of the increases in @xmath18 and @xmath9",
    "would therefore require to identify genes that specifically affect the lateral contraction of the tissue .",
    "our experimental method should be applicable to other tissues .",
    "performing experiments in an epithelium which is flat enough to significantly increase @xmath19 , and with a sufficient signal to noise ratio on the estimate of @xmath48 , would enable to check the scaling of @xmath48 _ versus _ @xmath19 given by equation  [ eq : def : xibar ] .",

    "the time - lapse laser - scanning microscope lsm710 nlo ( carl zeiss microimaging ) collected 512@xmath89512 pixel images in mono - photon mode at 488 nm excitation ( pixel size in the range 0.24 to 0.29 @xmath12 m ) through a plan - apochromat 63@xmath891.40 oil objective . before and after severing , the time interval between two consecutive frames was either 393 ms or 970 ms according to the scanning mode ( bi- or mono - directional ) , without any apparent effect on the results presented here .",
    "we focused on the adherens junctions to be severed ; due to the epithelial surface curvature especially in old pupae , adherens junctions of innermost and outermost regions were slightly out of focus ( figure  [ fig : fit_ellipse ] and movies 1 - 3 ) .    we defined a region of interest as an annular region between two concentric circles .",
    "we severed it at the 10@xmath90 frame ( figure  [ fig : fit_ellipse ] ) and defined @xmath19 as the radius of its inner circle .",
    "laser severing was performed using ti : sapphire laser ( mai tai deepsee , spectra physics ) in two - photon mode at 890  nm , @xmath91  100  fs pulses , 80  mhz repetition rate , @xmath11 0.2  w at the back focal plane , used at slightly less than full power to avoid cavitation ( esm figure  2 ) @xcite .",
    "severing itself had a duration ranging from 217 to 1300 ms ( according to the size of the region of interest and the scanning mode ) during which no image was acquired .",
    "we could check that the severing had been effective to remove their adherens junctions , rather than simply bleach them ( esm figure  2 ) : after retraction the cells at the wound margin moved apart more than a cell diameter ; moreover , there was no fluorescence recovery ( figure  [ fig : fit_ellipse ] ( d ) ) .      at the tissue scale , for each frame after the severing the inner severed tissue boundary was fitted with an ellipse ( figure  [ fig : fit_ellipse ] ( c - d ) ) using the ovuscule @xcite imagej plugin @xcite .",
    "we have modified it so that each fitting procedure started from the ellipse fitted on the preceding   are linearly fitted over a 5 frames sliding window in order to improve the signal to noise of position and velocity determinations .",

    "we took the logarithm of the grey levels , to obtain comparable intensity gradients in differently contrasted parts of the image ( figure  [ fig : klt ] ( a ) ) .",
    "this allowed us to use kanade - lucas - tomasi ( klt ) @xcite tracking algorithm @xcite by selecting @xmath92  features \" of interest , corresponding to most cell vertices ( figure  [ fig : klt ] ( a ) ) .",
    "features were tracked from frame to frame : they followed the cell vertex movement towards the center , and we have observed no cell neighbour swapping .",
    "we checked that the features center of mass had only a small displacement , which we subtracted from individual feature displacements without loss of generality .",
    "to implement a quasi-1d analysis , we collected the features in a band along the @xmath0 axis and similarly along the @xmath4 axis ( figure  [ fig : klt ] ( b - c ) ) , and both axes were analysed separately . the band width ( here @xmath93 of the initial circle diameter ) was chosen to be large enough to perform large statistics on features , and small enough to treat the features displacement as one - dimensional .",
    "we numerically solved adimensionalized equations ( see esm ) using the matlab solver ` pdepde ` . for a given set of parameter values @xmath94 , we calculated @xmath73 from the strain of the feature of largest initial amplitude , and rescaled the solution of esm equation  21 so as to satisfy esm equation  10 . using the experimental initial positions of features @xmath95 and the calculated strain field @xmath52 , we simulated the trajectories @xmath96 , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 was the number of features .",

    "<S> it accounts for individual cell properties using only a few spatially averaged material parameters . to determine the mechanical state and parameters in the _ drosophila _ pupa dorsal thorax epithelium , we sever _ in vivo </S>",
    "<S> _ the adherens junctions around a disk - shaped domain comprising typically hundred cells . </S>",
    "<S> this enables a direct measurement of the strain along different orientations at once . the amplitude and anisotropy of the strain increase during development . </S>",
    "<S> we also measure the stress to viscosity ratio and similarly find an increase in amplitude and anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation time is of order of ten seconds . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a space - time , continuous model of the relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement with experimental data validates the description of the epithelial domain as a continuous , linear , visco - elastic material . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relevant time and length scales . </S>",
    "<S> another material parameter , the ratio of external friction to internal viscosity , is estimated by fitting the initial velocity profile . together , our results contribute to quantify forces and displacements , and their time evolution during morphogenesis . </S>"
