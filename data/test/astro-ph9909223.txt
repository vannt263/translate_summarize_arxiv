    "in spite of the darkness of the sky at ultraviolet wavelengths ( oconnell 1987 ) and of the crucial role played by the @xmath0 emission in the determination of the metal production rate , the @xmath0 band is still one of the less explored spectral regions .",
    "this is even more true for objects in the local universe , because non redshifted @xmath0 emission can be observed only from space . in both the single stellar population and continuous star formation scenarios , the @xmath0 luminosity of late ",
    "type galaxies appears to be largely dominated by young massive stars , thus implying a direct link between @xmath0 luminosities and star formation rates ( e.g. buzzoni 1989 ) .    in recent years , the understanding that samples of galaxies at very high redshift can be selected from multicolor deep images ( such as the _ hubble deep field _ ) , has renewed the interest in @xmath0 observations , allowing tentative determinations of the @xmath0 luminosity function ( hereafter lf ) for galaxies at @xmath6 ( steidel et al . 1999 ,",
    "pozzetti et al . 1998 ) . in the local universe , available samples of @xmath0 data for normal galaxies are generally not suitable for these types of studies due to either the lack of well defined selection criteria ( see for instance the iue sample reviewed in longo & capaccioli 1992 ) or to the optical selection of the objects .",
    "exceptions to this rule are the samples produced by the foca experiment ( milliard et al",
    ". 1991 ) which allowed to derive , among various other quantities , the _ local field",
    "_ @xmath0 luminosity function ( treyer et al . 1998 ) , and to constrain the @xmath0 luminosity function of galaxies in the coma cluster ( donas , milliard , & laget 1991 , hereafter dml91 ) .    in this paper",
    "we rediscuss the @xmath0 luminosity function ( lf , hereafter ) of galaxies in the coma cluster , first explored by dml91 .",
    "since dml91 two important sets of data have been acquired : the sample of galaxies with known redshift in the coma direction has increased by about 60 % , and background counts in @xmath0 , essential for computing the lf , have been measured .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : we first describe the data used (  2 ) , then , we present the color  magnitude and color  color relations for galaxies in the coma cluster direction (  3 ) and we show that the availability of colors does not help in identifying interlopers . in  4 we use field counts and the extensive redshift surveys in the coma cluster direction to constrain background counts in the coma direction and to derive the coma cluster lf , presented in  5 . in  6",
    "we discuss the bivariate lf and , finally , in  7 we compare the coma @xmath0 lf to the recently determined field lf . a summary is given in  8 .",
    "in this paper we adopt @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "among nearby clusters of galaxies , coma ( @xmath9 km s@xmath8 ) is one of the richest ( @xmath10 ) ones . at a first glance , it looks relaxed and virialized in both the optical and x - ray passbands . for this reason it was designed by sarazin ( 1986 ) and jones & forman ( 1984 ) as the prototype of this class of clusters .",
    "the optical structure and photometry at many wavelengths , velocity field , and x - ray appearance of the cluster ( see the references listed in andreon 1996 ) suggest the existence of substructures .",
    "since these phenomena are also observed in many other clusters ( salvador - sol , sanrom , & gonzles - casado 1993 ) , the coma cluster appears typical also in this respect .",
    "coma was observed in the @xmath0 with a panoramic detector ( foca ) .",
    "complementary data , are taken from godwin , metcalfe & peach ( 1983 ; blue and red isophotal magnitudes designed here @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ) and andreon ( 1996 ; radial velocities taken from the literature and updated for this paper by means of new ned entries and accurate morphological types ) .    the foca experiment consisted in a 40-cm cassegrain telescope equipped with an itt proximity focused image intensifier coupled to a iiao photographic emulsion .",
    "the filter , centered at 2000   with a bandwidth of 150  , has negligible red leakage for objects as red as g0 stars and little dependence of the effective wavelength upon the object effective temperature .",
    "observations of the coma cluster were obtained with a field of view of 2.3 deg and a position accuracy of about 5 arcsec .",
    "the angular resolution of 20 arcsec fwhm was too coarse to allow an effective discrimination between stars and galaxies ( for more details on the experiment see milliard et al .",
    "the observations consisted of many short exposures , totalizing 3000s , and were obtained in april 1988 .",
    "the galaxy catalog and details on the data reduction were published in dml91 and donas , milliard , & laget ( 1995 , hereafter dml95 ) .",
    "coma @xmath0 selected sample is found by dml95 to be complete down to @xmath13 mag and 70% complete in the range @xmath14 mag and includes only @xmath0 sources with at least one optical counterpart .",
    "detected objects were classified by dml91 and dml95 as stars or galaxies according to their optical appearance .",
    "following dml91 , the @xmath0 magnitude is defined by the expression : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the flux in ergs @xmath17a@xmath8 .",
    "typical photometric errors are 0.3 mag down to @xmath18 mag and reach 0.5 mag at the detection limit @xmath19 mag .",
    "figure 1 ( upper panel ) shows the @xmath4 vs @xmath0 color  magnitude diagram for the 254 galaxies detected in the uv in the coma field .",
    "this sample includes a larger number of galaxies with known redshift than in dml91 , due to the numerous redshift surveys undertaken since 1991 .",
    "we consider as coma members only galaxies with @xmath20 km s@xmath8 ( which is similar or identical to the criteria adopted by kent & gunn ( 1982 ) , mazure et al .",

    "figure 1 shows that only a few galaxies detected in @xmath0 are near to the optical catalog limit ( @xmath21 mag ) , except at @xmath19 mag , suggesting that only a minority of uv galaxies are missed because they are not visible in the optical galaxy catalog contains only sources with at least one optical counterpart , see dml95 . ] .",
    "this confirms the dml91 statement that the @xmath0 sample is truly @xmath0 selected , except maybe in the last half  magnitude bin .",
    "many optically  faint and @xmath0bright galaxies have not measured redshift .",
    "the lower panel in figure 1 shows the optical @xmath5 vs @xmath11 color - magnitude diagram for the brightest ( in @xmath11 ) 254 galaxies in the same field .",
    "we have accurate morphological types for all galaxies brighter than @xmath22 mag ( andreon et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "coma early  type galaxies ( i.e. ellipticals and lenticulars ) have @xmath23 mag and @xmath24 mag ( dml95 , andreon 1996 ) .",
    "the comparison of the two panels in figure 1 shows several interesting features .",
    "first of all , bright @xmath0 galaxies are blue and not red , as instead is the case in the optical . in other words ,",
    "early  type galaxies , due to their @xmath0 faintness , do not dominate the @xmath0 color  magnitude diagram .",
    "red and blue galaxies are small fractions of the @xmath0 and optically selected samples , respectively .    in second place , galaxies show a much larger spread in @xmath4 ( 7 mag for the whole sample , 6 mag for the redshift confirmed coma members ) than in @xmath5 or in any other optical or optical  near  infrared color ( see , for example , the compilation in andreon ( 1996 ) ) . from the theoretical point of view , such a large scatter in color implies that the @xmath0 and @xmath11 passbands trace the emission of quite different stellar populations . for all but the very old stellar populations , the @xmath0 traces mainly the emission from young stars ( see for instance donas et al .",
    "1984 ; buat et al .",
    "1989 ) , having maximum main sequence lifetime of a few @xmath25 years .",
    "therefore , for star forming galaxies the @xmath0 is a direct measure of the present epoch star formation rate .",
    "optical data provide instead a weighted average of the past to present star formation rate .",
    "the large scatter in color therefore implies that galaxies bright in @xmath0 are not necessarily massive , but more likely the most active in forming stars .    from the observational point of view",
    ", this large scatter in color is a problem , since deep optical observations are needed to derive optical magnitudes and hence colors ( blue galaxies with @xmath26 mag have @xmath27 mag ) or even for discriminating stars from galaxies .",
    "this limitation makes difficult to characterize the properties of @xmath0 selected samples , such as , for instance , the optical morphology ( a galaxy with @xmath26 mag is bright and large enough to be morphologically classified only if it is quite red ) ; the redshift ( since they are usually measured from the optical emission or for an optically selected sample ) ; the luminosity function of galaxies in cluster ( the background subtraction is uncertain because the stellar contribution is difficult to estimate in absence of a deep optical imaging ) , etc .",
    "furthermore , it is dangerous to limit the sample to galaxies with known redshift or morphological type , since , this would introduce a selection criterion ( mainly an optical selection ) which has nothing to do with the @xmath0 properties of the galaxies .",
    "figure 2 shows the color  magnitude diagram for the field in a direction that in part overlaps the coma optical catalog provided by godwin et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and includes even a few members located in the coma outskirts .",
    "also these data were obtained with foca ( treyer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "most of the background galaxies have blue apparent colors , but with a large spread .",
    "almost no background galaxies lay in the upper - right corner of the graph , i.e. no background galaxy is simultaneously very red ( @xmath23 ) and faint ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the selection criteria used by treyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for studying this sample are quite complex and galaxies with missing redshift ( failed or not observed ) are not listed , so that it is not trivial to perform a background subtraction in the color  magnitude plane ( as it is sometimes done in the optical ; see , for instance , dressler et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the color - color diagram of galaxies in the direction of coma ( figure 3 ) has already been discussed in dml95 .",
    "but , in our sample , the number of galaxies having known membership is larger by 60% ( from 61 to 99 galaxies ) .",
    "the diagram shows that background galaxies have colors overlapping those of known coma galaxies , and , therefore , it is not of much use in discriminating members from non  members .",
    "this conclusion is strengthened by fragmentary knowledge of colors of @xmath0selected samples , which renders premature to adopt a color selection criterion for the purpose of measuring the lf .",
    "since clusters are by definition volume ",
    "limited samples , the measure of the cluster lf consists in counting galaxies in each magnitude bin _",
    "after _ having removed the interlopers , i.e. galaxies along the same line of sight but not belonging to the cluster .",
    "in general , interlopers can be removed in three different ways : by determining the membership of each galaxy throughout an extensive redshift survey , by a statistical subtraction of the expected background contamination ( see , for instance , oemler 1976 ) , or by using color  color or color  magnitude diagrams ( see for instance , dressler et al .",
    "1994 and garilli , maccagni & andreon 1999 ) .    in our case ,",
    "the available color informations are not sufficient to discriminate members from interlopers , and surveys in the coma direction available in literature are not complete down to the magnitude limit of our sample .",
    "therefore we were forced to use a hybrid method to estimate and remove the background contribution .    because the available membership information is qualitatively different for bright and faint galaxies , we consider them separately . for almost all galaxies brighter than @xmath28 mag ,",
    "redshifts are available in the literature , and interlopers can be removed one by one . for fainter galaxies we compute the lf from a statistical subtraction of the field counts , and ,",
    "therefore , the largest source of error may come from possible large background fluctuations from field to field .",
    "milliard et al .",
    "( 1992 ) present galaxy counts in three random fields , measured with the same experiment used to acquire the coma data .",
    "one of the pointings is very near in the sky to the coma cluster .",
    "the slope is nearly euclidean for the total ( i.e. galaxy+stars ) counts ( @xmath29 ) with a small scatter among the counts in the three directions ( roughly 10% ) . after removing the stellar contribution ,",
    "galaxy counts have again a nearly euclidean slope , but an amplitude which is half the previous one .",
    "dots in figure 4 show galaxy counts ( i.e. @xmath30 ) in the coma direction ( we simply count all galaxies in each bin , open dots and dashed line in the figure ) and the average of the three  field directions \" ( solid dots and solid line ) . at magnitudes fainter than @xmath31 mag ,",
    "galaxy counts in the coma direction are _ lower _ than those in directions not including clusters of galaxies , although errorbars are quite large . at first sight , this plot is surprising : clusters are overdensities and therefore counts in their directions should be higher than field counts . however , this expectation is not necessarily correct in the @xmath0 band .",
    "star formation is inhibited in the high density environments ( hashimoto et al , 1998 , merluzzi et al , 1999 ) and therefore counts in the direction of the cluster can be similar , or even lower , to counts not having clusters on the line of sight .",
    "the @xmath0 luminosity is , in fact , a poor indicator for the galaxy mass .",
    "another possible explanation could be related to large errors and large background fluctuations from field to field .",
    "we discuss now in depth this point , taking advantage of the existence of redshift surveys available in the coma cluster direction .",
    "figure 5 shows _ integral _",
    "counts ( i.e. @xmath32 ) .",
    "the solid line is the integral of the solid line in figure 4 , i.e. it gives is the _ expected integral _ field galaxy counts .",
    "all other lines refer instead to true measurements in the coma cluster direction .",
    "the lower solid histogram in figure 5 is the lower limit to the background in the coma cluster direction , computed as the sum of the galaxies having ( known ) velocity falling outside of the assumed range for coma .",
    "the upper solid histogram is the upper limit to the background in the coma cluster direction , given , instead , as the sum of the galaxies outside of the assumed velocity range and the galaxies with unknown membership .",
    "the dotted lines are the @xmath33 confidence contours , for the lower and upper limits , computed according to gehrels ( 1986 ) .",
    "they simply account for poissonian fluctuations and show how large ( or small ) the real background could be ( at the 68% confidence level ) in order to observe such large ( or small ) counts .",
    "a background lower than the lower dotted histogram would produce too few ( at the 68% confidence level ) interlopers in the coma cluster direction with respect to the observed ones ; whereas a background higher than the higher dotted histogram would imply ( always at the 68 % confidence level ) a number of galaxies larger than the size of the sample ( once the coma members are removed ) . to summarize , in order to be consistent ( at the 68% confidence level ) with redshift surveys in the coma direction , background counts in the coma direction must be bracketed in between the two dotted histogram . assuming smooth counts of nearly euclidean slope",
    ", we consider the most extreme amplitudes for the background that are still compatible at the 68% confidence level with the two dashed histograms in at least one magnitude bin , and in what follow we call them  maximum@xmath34 \" and  minimum@xmath35 \" . under the hypothesis of a nearly euclidean slope ,",
    "the background in the coma direction turns out to be between 2.8 and 17.8 times smaller than the expectation shown by the line in figure 5 .",
    "the expected field counts ( i.e. the line in figure 5 ) are @xmath36 away from the maximum background allowed by the coma redshift survey ( i.e. the upper solid histogram ) .",
    "this is an unlikely but not impossible situation , in particular when we take into account that the stellar contribution has been assumed and not measured in two background fields and that counts are slightly over  estimated , due to the presence of the coma cluster and supercluster ( treyer et al .",
    "1998 ) in the last field .",
    "in the previous section we derived an estimate for the background in the coma cluster direction or , to be more precise , a range for the amplitude of background counts under the further assumption of nearly euclidean slope for background counts .",
    "we can , therefore , statistically remove the background contribution and compute the faint end of the lf ( at bright magnitudes the membership is known for each individual galaxy ) and look at the dependence of the lf on the assumed values of the background amplitude .",
    "therefore , the determination of the faint end of the lf still depends in part on the poorly known background counts , but much less than in dml91 since at that time the slope and the amplitude of the background contribution were almost unknown and it was left free to span over a range extending from almost all the data to zero .",
    "in order to clarify the error implied by our limited knowledge of the background counts , we compute twice the lower end of the lf , assuming a minimum@xmath35 background and a maximum@xmath34 one .",
    "the actual coma @xmath0 lf is bracketed in between .",
    "we made use of a maximum  likelihood method ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) to fit the differential lf of coma with a schechter ( 1976 ) or power law functions :    @xmath37    @xmath38    the most important advantage of the maximum  likelihood method is that it does not require to bin the data in an arbitrarily chosen bin size and works well also with small samples where the @xmath39 fitting is not useful .",
    "it also naturally accounts for lower limits ( bins with zero counts if data are binned ) .",
    "the maximum likelihood method leaves the normalization factor undetermined ( since it is reduced in the computation ) .",
    "we therefore derived it by requiring that the integral of the best fit is equal to the observed number of galaxies . in our case",
    "we have 125 and 233 galaxies in the coma sample , depending on the adopted background subtraction .",
    "the coma cluster @xmath0 lf - the first ever derived for a cluster - is shown in figure 6 .",
    "error bars are large , and only the rough shape of the lf can be sketched .",
    "the coma @xmath0 lf is well described by a power law ( or alternatively by a schechter function with a characteristic magnitude @xmath40 much brighter than the brightest galaxy ) : a kolmogorov - smirnov test could not reject at more than 20% confidence level the null hypothesis that the data are extracted from the best fit ( whereas we need a 68% confidence level to exclude the model at @xmath33 ) .",
    "the best slope is @xmath41 and @xmath42 assuming a maximum@xmath34 and minimum@xmath35 background contamination , respectively . in terms of the slope of the schechter ( 1976 ) function @xmath43 , these values are @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "the exact value of the background amplitude , once bound by redshift surveys , have small impact on the slope of the lf , which is quite steep . the coma @xmath0 lf is steeper than the optical lf , ( @xmath46 , from 5000   to 8000   garilli , maccagni & andreon 1999 ) , when computed within a similar range of magnitudes ( i.e. at @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the magnitude of the 3th brightest galaxy of the cluster ) .",
    "it needs to be stressed , however , that the computed slope of the lf depends on the assumption of a nearly euclidean slope for galaxy counts ( the amplitude is constrained by the redshift survey ) .",
    "we now measure the effect of neglecting this hypothesis .",
    "a very low limit to the slope of the coma lf can be computed under the extreme assumption that all galaxies not confirmed as coma members ( i.e. all galaxies without known redshift and those with redshifts outside the velocity range of coma members ) are actual interlopers .",
    "the resulting lf is shown in figure 7 .",
    "no matter how large and how complex the shape of background counts in the coma direction is , this estimate provides the very low limit to the slope of the coma lf because galaxies with unknown membership are only faint , and they could only rise the faint part of the lf . in such an extreme case , we find @xmath49 mag , brighter than the brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "fitting a power law , we find instead @xmath50 . even in this case",
    ", however , the slope is larger than what is found in the optical ( at @xmath47 ) .",
    "this lf is computed with no assumption about the shape of the background counts .",
    "this lf is unlikely to be near to the  true \" coma @xmath0 lf , because the assumption that all galaxies with unknown redshift are interlopers is unrealistic and implies an over  euclidean slope ( @xmath51 ) for the background , which is much steeper than those observed in the three field pointings by milliard , donas & laget ( 1992 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this very low limit lf gives the very minimum slope for the coma @xmath0 lf , @xmath52 .",
    "the steep coma @xmath0 lf implies that faint and bright galaxies give similar contributions to the total @xmath0 flux , and that the total @xmath0 flux has not yet converged 4 magnitude fainter than the brightest galaxy ( or , which is the same , at @xmath47 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to derive the total luminosity and hence the metal production rate , it is very important to measure the lf down to faint magnitude limits .",
    "since the redshift information is quite different for blue ( @xmath53 ) and red ( @xmath54 ) galaxies , the two @xmath0 lfs are computed in different ways .",
    "redshifts are available for all the red galaxies ( which all belong to the cluster ) and the respective @xmath0 lf is easy to compute .",
    "almost all blue galaxies brighter than @xmath55 mag have known redshift , and therefore the determination of this part of the blue lf is quite robust . for the faint part of the blue lf",
    ", we adopt an  average \" background , given as the average normalization between the maximum@xmath34 and minimum@xmath35 backgrounds previously computed .    the resulting bivariate color  luminosity function is given in figure 8 .",
    "the bulk of the @xmath0 emission comes from blue ( @xmath53 ) galaxies while all red galaxies have @xmath56 mag .",
    "therefore , since blue galaxies dominate the @xmath0 lf both in number and luminosity , the coma @xmath0 lf is dominated by star forming galaxies and not by massive galaxies . from previous morphological studies",
    "( andreon 1996 ) it turns out that coma red galaxies in our sample are ellipticals or lenticulars .",
    "the fact that early  type galaxies contribute little to the @xmath0 lf may be explained as a consequence of the fact that these systems have a low recent star formation histories .",
    "please note that in the optical , the lf is dominated at the extreme bright end by the early  type ( i.e. red ) galaxies ( bingelli , sandage & tammann 1988 , andreon 1998 ) , and not by blue ones as it is in @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 lf of field galaxies has been recently measured by treyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in a region close to coma , where they found @xmath57 , @xmath58 mag for a sample of 74 galaxies . as pointed out by buzzoni ( 1998 ) , this slope is quite different from that assumed for the distant field galaxies by madau ( 1997 ) .",
    "is there any significant difference between the coma cluster and the field @xmath0 lfs ?",
    "the best schechter fit to the field data satisfactorily matches both the very low limit to the coma lf and the coma data after the subtraction of the maximum@xmath34 background contribution ( the probability of a worse fit is 0.1 , according to the kolmogorov - smirnov test , whereas we need a probability of 0.05 to call the fit worse at @xmath59 ) , but does not in the case of minimum@xmath35 background contribution ( the probability of a worse fit is 0.00078 , according to the same test , i.e. the two lf differ at @xmath60 ) .",
    "however , using @xmath61 instead of @xmath43 for the field lf , the fit to the coma data can not be rejected with a probability larger than 0.02 , i.e. , the @xmath33 confidence contour of the field lf crosses the @xmath62 confidence contour of the coma lf .",
    "therefore , given the available data , coma and field @xmath0 lfs are different at @xmath63 at most . given the large errors involved , the field and clusters lfs result therefore compatible with each other .",
    "the analysis of @xmath0 and optical properties of coma galaxies is indicative of the difficulties encountered in studying @xmath0 selected samples : background galaxy counts are uncertain ( as well as their variance ) ; the background contamination in the @xmath0 color  magnitude plane is poorly known . in spite of these difficulties we found :      \\2 )",
