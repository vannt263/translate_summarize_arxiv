    "the goal of this paper is to understand the role of mutations on the evolution of fitness and age characteristics of individuals in a simple age - structured population dynamics model@xcite .",
    "while there are many classical models to describe single - species population dynamics@xcite , consideration of age - dependent characteristics is a more recent development@xcite . typically",
    ", age characteristics of a population are determined by studying rate equations which include age - dependent birth and death rates . here",
    "we will study an extension of age - structured population dynamics in which the characteristics of an offspring are mutated with respect to its parent .",
    "in particular , an offspring may be more `` fit '' or less fit than its parent , and this may be reflected in attributes such as its birth rate and/or its life expectancy .    in our model , we characterize the fitness of an individual by a single heritable trait  the life expectancy @xmath2  which is defined as the average life span of an individual in the absence of competition .",
    "this provides a useful fitness measure , as a longer - lived individual has a higher chance of producing more offspring throughout its life span .",
    "we allow for either deleterious or advantageous mutations , where the offspring fitness is less than or greater than that of the parent , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ scheme ] ) .",
    "this leads to three different behaviors which depend on the ratio between these two mutation rates .",
    "when advantageous mutation is favored , the fitness distribution of the population approaches a gaussian , with the average fitness growing linearly with time @xmath0 and the width of the distribution increasing as @xmath3 .",
    "conversely , when deleterious mutation is more likely , a steady - state fitness distribution is approached , with the rate of approach varying as @xmath4 .",
    "when there is no mutational bias , the fitness distribution again approaches a gaussian , but with average fitness growing as @xmath1 and the width of the distribution again growing as @xmath3 .    in all three cases , the average population age reaches a steady state which , surprisingly , is a _ decreasing _ function of the average fitness .",
    "thus within our model , _ a more fit population does not lead to an increased individual lifetime_. qualitatively , as individuals become more fit , competition plays a more prominent role and is the primary mechanism that leads to premature mortality .    0.25 in 0.1 in    in the following two sections , we formally define the model and outline qualitative features of the population dynamics . in secs .",
    "iv - vi , we analyze the three cases of deleterious , advantageous , and neutral mutational biases in detail .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "various calculational details are provided in the appendices .",
    "our model is a simple extension of logistic dynamics in which a population with overall density @xmath5 evolves both by birth at rate @xmath6 and death at rate @xmath7 .",
    "such a system is described by the rate equation @xmath8 with steady - state solution @xmath9 .",
    "our age - structured mutation model incorporates the following additional features :    1 .",
    "each individual is endowed with given life expectancy @xmath2 .",
    "this means that an individual has a rate of dying which equals @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   death by aging occurs at a rate inversely proportional to the life expectancy .",
    "3 .   individuals give birth at a constant rate during their lifetimes .",
    "4 .   in each birth event",
    ", the life expectancy of the newborn may be equal to that of its parent , or the life expectancy may be increased by or decreased by 1 .",
    "the relative rates of these events are @xmath6 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "each of these features represent idealizations .",
    "most prominently , it would be desirable to incorporate a realistic mortality rate which is an increasing function of age@xcite . however , we argue in sec .",
    "vii that our basic conclusions continue to be valid for systems with realistic mortality rates .    to describe this dynamics mathematically , we study @xmath13 , the density of individuals with life expectancy @xmath14 and age @xmath15 at time @xmath0 .",
    "we also introduce @xmath16 , which is the density of individuals with life expectancy @xmath2 and _ any _ age at time @xmath0 .",
    "finally , the total population density is the integral of the population density over all ages and life expectancies , @xmath17    according to our model , the rate equation for @xmath13 is @xmath18 the derivative with respect to @xmath15 on the left - hand side accounts for the continuous aging of the population@xcite . on the right - hand side",
    ", @xmath19 is the death rate due to competition , which is assumed to be independent of an individual s age and fitness .",
    "as discussed above , the mortality rate is taken as age independent , and the form @xmath20 guarantees that the life expectancy in the absence of competition equals @xmath2 . because birth creates individuals of age @xmath21 , the population of newborns provides the following boundary condition for @xmath22 , @xmath23 finally , the condition @xmath24 follows from the requirement that offspring with zero life expectancy can not be born .",
    "let us first study the fitness characteristics of the population and disregard the age structure .",
    "the rate equation for @xmath25 is found by integrating eq .",
    "( [ cn ] ) over all ages and then using the boundary condition eq .",
    "( [ boundary ] ) to give @xmath26 this describes a random - walk - like process with state - dependent hopping rates in the one - dimensional fitness space @xmath2 . notice the hidden non - linearity embodied by the term @xmath27 , since the total population density @xmath28 . from eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) , we find that @xmath5 obeys a generalized logistic equation @xmath29    0.15 in 0.1 in    the three different dynamical regimes outlined in the introduction are characterized by the relative magnitudes of the mutation rates @xmath11 and @xmath12",

    "the fitness of the population eventually reaches a steady state . *",

    "* * supercritical case .",
    "* here @xmath32 , or advantageous mutations are favorable .",
    "the average fitness grows linearly in time and the width of the fitness distribution still grows as @xmath3 .    in all three cases , the total population density @xmath33 and the average age @xmath34 , defined by @xmath35",
    "saturate to finite values .",
    "the steady state values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 may be determined by balance between the total birth rate @xmath36 and the death rate @xmath7 due to overcrowding .",
    "for example , in the critical and supercritical cases , there are essentially no individuals with small fitness , so that the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) may be neglected .",
    "then the steady - state solution to this equation is simply @xmath37 this statement also expresses the obvious fact that in the steady state the total birth rate @xmath38 must balance the total death rate @xmath7 .",
    "( for fit populations , the death rate due to aging is negligible . )   similarly , the average age may be inferred from the condition it must equal the average time between death events .",
    "thus @xmath39 the behavior of the average age in the subcritical case is more subtle and we treat this case in detail in the section following .",
    "when deleterious mutations are favored ( @xmath40 ) , the random - walk - like master equation for @xmath41 contains both the mutational bias towards the absorbing boundary at the origin , as well as an effective positive bias due to the @xmath10 term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) .",
    "the balance between these two opposite biases leads to a stationary state whose solution is found by setting @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) . to obtain this steady state solution , it is convenient to introduce the generating function @xmath43 multiplying eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) by @xmath44 and summing over @xmath2 gives @xmath45 the term involving @xmath46 is simplified by using @xmath47 multiplying eq .",
    "( [ gf - int ] ) by @xmath48 and differentiating with respect to @xmath48 gives @xmath49 where the prime denotes differentiation .",
    "as in the case of the master equation for @xmath41 , this differential equation for @xmath50 has a hidden indeterminacy , as the total population density @xmath51 appears on the right - hand side .",
    "thus an integration of eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) , subject to the boundary condition @xmath52 , actually gives a family of solutions which are parameterized by the value of @xmath33 . while the family of solutions can be obtained straightforwardly by a direct integration of eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) , only one member of this family is the correct one . to determine this true solution",
    ", we must invoke additional arguments about the physically realizable value of @xmath33 for a given initial condition .",
    "an upper bound for @xmath33 may be found from the steady - state version of eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) , @xmath53 since the right - hand side must be non - negative , this provides the bound @xmath54 . on the other hand ,",
    "we may obtain a lower bound for @xmath33 by considering the master equation for @xmath41 in the steady state . for @xmath55",

    "hence we require @xmath59 .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath33 must lie in the range @xmath60    while the foregoing suggests that @xmath33 lies within a finite range , we find numerically that the minimal solution , which satisfies the lower bound of eq .",
    "( [ bounds ] ) , is the one that is generally realized ( fig .",
    "this selection phenomenon is reminiscent of the corresponding behavior in the fisher - kolmogorov equation and related reaction - diffusion systems@xcite , where only the extremal solution is selected from a continuous range of _ a priori _ solutions .    0.25 in 0.1 in    to understand the nature of this extremal solution in the present context , notice that with the bounds on @xmath33 given in eq .  ( [ bounds ] ) , @xmath61 lies within the range @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the fundamental parameter which characterizes the mutational bias . consequently the steady - state fitness distribution decays exponentially with @xmath2 , namely @xmath64 .",
    "when the total population density attains the minimal value @xmath65 , @xmath61 also achieves its minimum possible value @xmath66 , so that the fitness distribution has the most rapid decay in @xmath2 for the minimal solution .",
    "based on the analogy with the fisher - kolmogorov equation@xcite , we infer that there are two distinct steady - state behaviors for @xmath41 as a function of the initial condition @xmath67 . for any @xmath67 with either a finite support in @xmath2 or decaying at least as fast as @xmath68 , the extremal solution @xmath69 is approached as @xmath70 .",
    "conversely , for initial conditions in which @xmath67 decays more slowly than @xmath71 , for example as @xmath72 , with @xmath73 in the range @xmath74 , the asymptotic solution also decays as @xmath72 .",
    "correspondingly , eq .  ( [ pn ] ) in the steady state predicts a larger than minimal population density @xmath75 .    0.25 in 0.1 in",
    "we also find that the extremal and the non - extremal solutions exhibit different relaxations to the steady state .",
    "for those initial conditions which evolve to the extremal solution , the deviation of @xmath33 and indeed each of the @xmath41 from their steady state values decay as @xmath4 , while for all other initial conditions , the relaxation to the steady state appears to follow a @xmath76 power law decay .",
    "the power - law approach to the steady state is surprising , since the overall density obeys a logistic - like dynamics , @xmath77 , for which the approach to the steady state is exponential .",
    "these results are illustrated in fig .",

    "( [ pn ] ) with the fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm@xcite .",
    "the demonstration of the @xmath4 relaxation to the extremal solution relies on a correspondence to the transient behavior in the critical case .",
    "this is presented in appendix b.    0.25 in 0.1 in    a disconcerting feature of the numerical calculation for @xmath5 is the small disagreement between the numerically observed values of the steady - state population density and the expected theoretical prediction ( fig .  [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy arises from the finite computer precision which causes very small values of @xmath41 to be set to zero . to confirm this , we changed the computer precision from @xmath78 to the full machine precision of @xmath79 ( fig .",

    "@xmath84 for many applications , however , there is no need to deal with these unwieldy expressions . as we now discuss , the overall fitness or age characteristics of the population can be obtained directly from the generating function without using the explicit formulae for the @xmath41 .",

    "we now demonstrate this fact . to provide a fair comparison we take the total birth rate rate to be equal to unity in both cases and also choose @xmath105 for simplicity . for fit populations ( critical and supercritical cases ) ,",
    "the average age is simply @xmath106 . for the least fit population @xmath107 , and correspondingly @xmath108 . in this limit , we may write eq .",

    "( [ avf ] ) we have @xmath110    the relation @xmath111 is natural for the least fit population , as the total density is small and competition among individuals plays an insignificant role",
    ". thus the average age may be found by merely averaging the intrinsic life expectancy of the population .",
    "intriguingly , in this limit the average individual in the least fit population lives twice as long as individuals in relatively fit populations .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the limit of a minimally fit population ( @xmath107 ) we can expand the generating function in eq .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) systematically .",
    "we thereby find that the density @xmath41 exhibits a super - exponential decay , @xmath112 .",
    "when advantageous mutations are favored , the master equation for @xmath41 , eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) , can be viewed as a random walk with a bias towards increasing @xmath2 . because there is no mechanism to counterbalance this bias",

    "since the fitness profile is non - zero only for large @xmath2 in the long time limit , it is appropriate to adopt continuum approach .",

    "we now substitute this asymptotic behavior for the total population density into eq .",
    "( [ px ] ) to obtain @xmath122 notice that the birth / death term on the right hand side is negative ( positive ) for subpopulations which are less ( more ) fit than average fitness @xmath118 .",
    "this birth / death term must also be zero , on average , since the total population density saturates to a constant value .",
    "moreover , this term must be small near the peak of the fitness distributions where @xmath123 .",

    "( [ px1 ] ) are of order @xmath129 , thus justifying the neglect of birth / death term .",
    "we now turn to the age characteristics .",
    "asymptotically , the density of individuals with given age and fitness changes slowly with time because the overall density reaches a steady state .",

    "fast_. physically this contrast reflects the fact that during the lifetime of an individual the change in the overall age characteristics of the population is small .",
    "thus in the first approximation , we retain only the age derivative in eq .",

    "we also ignore the term @xmath20 , which is small near the peak of the asymptotic fitness distribution .",

    "iii  b , the surprising conclusion is that the average age in the supercritical case is always _ smaller _ than that in the subcritical case .",
    "we now consider the critical case where the rates of advantageous and deleterious mutations are equal . without the @xmath10 term and with @xmath133 , eq .  ( [ pn ] ) becomes the master equation for an unbiased random walk on the semi - infinite range @xmath134 . due to the @xmath10 term , the system has a bias towards increasing @xmath2 which vanishes as @xmath55 ( see fig .",
