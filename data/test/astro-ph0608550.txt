    "radio emission associated with the development of extensive air showers ( eas ) was investigated in the 1960 s  @xcite .",
    "a flurry of experiments provided initial information about signals from @xmath1  ev cosmic rays  @xcite , but plagued by difficulties ( poor reproducibility , atmospheric effects , technical limitations ) efforts almost ceased in the late 1970 s while ground particle  @xcite and fluorescence  @xcite detector work continued . with the growing interest for ultra high - energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) research involving giant surface detectors  @xcite",
    ", radio detection however appears as a promising tool for future apparatus considering its specific advantages : low - cost , high duty cycle and sensitivity to the longitudinal development of the showers . although the rebirth of radio pulse investigation  @xcite is recent , first available results  @xcite demonstrate the feasibility of eas radio detection .",
    "the codalema ( cosmic ray detection array with logarithmic electro - magnetic antennas ) experiment , located at the nanay radio observatory  @xcite , is a part of this new effort .",
    "its originality lies in completely recording the form of the transient radio signals together with sampling the electric field over a few hundred meters range on the ground .",
    "this makes possible both the determination of arrival times and directions of radio pulses and the study of their field amplitude impact parameter dependences .",
    "the measurement of uhecr around @xmath2 ev is the admitted goal of such experimental development , but a proof - of - principle demonstration at such a large energy would suffer from a lack of statistics without an extensive antenna array .",
    "this point can be circumvented in a first stage by working around @xmath1  ev where a measurable signal amplitude  @xcite is expected at not too large distances from the shower core .",
    "considering a vertical shower falling upon the detector , the predicted transient should reach 150 @xmath3v / m with a 10 ns fwhm duration for @xmath1  ev cosmic rays  @xcite . transposed in the frequency domain",
    ", the corresponding pulse spectrum should extend from 1 to 100 mhz .",
    "thus , with a wide band antenna it should be possible to recover the original pulse shape , allowing for energy determination and providing information on the nature of the primary particle with minimal assumptions concerning its electromagnetic shower- signature .",
    "the design of codalema is based on these expectations .",
    "codalema has already provided firm evidence for a radio emission counterpart of eas with an estimated energy threshold of @xmath4  ev  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we extend the characterization of eas candidates giving special attention to the electric field pattern observed on an event - by - event basis .",

    "four of the antennas , namely ne , se , sw and nw , are located at the corners of the decameter array ( a rectangle of 87  m@xmath583  m ) . in order to investigate the electric field spread , the main improvement , as compared to the previous apparatus  @xcite , lies in the instrumentation of an east - west line , 608  m long , 40  m south of the sw - se antenna axis .",
    "this long baseline is equipped with 7  antennas with a sampling interval of 87  m from l1 to l5 and l2 to l6 and 130  m for l0 , l1 and l2 .",
    "all the antennas are linked , after radio frequency ( rf ) signal wide band amplification ( 35  db ) , via low loss coaxial cables ( suhner s12272 - 04 ) to lecroy digital oscilloscopes ( 8  bit adc , 500  mhz sampling frequency , 10  @xmath6s recording time ) . to get enough sensitivity to fast transients with these adcs ,",
    "the antennas are band - pass filtered ( @xmath7  mhz ) so that the adcs are not required to handle large amplitude , low - frequency interference .",
    "each 2.3  m@xmath8 particle detector module ( station ) has two layers of acrylic scintillator , read out by a photomultiplier located at the centre of each sheet .",
    "the photomultipliers have copper housings and it has been verified  @xcite that no correlation exists between individual photomultiplier signals and the presence of antenna signals .",
    "the coincidence between the top and bottom layers is obtained within a 60  ns time interval with a counting rate of 200  hz per station .",
    "the whole experiment is triggered by a fourfold coincidence from the stations in a 600  ns time window .",
    "the corresponding counting rate is around 0.7  events per minute .",
    "the directions of the particle showers are determined by triangulation , using arrival times from the digitized photomultiplier signals and assuming the particle wavefront is a plane .",
    "the angular acceptance of the trigger device can be studied by calculating its counting rate as a function of the zenith angle @xmath9 ( see fig .  [",

    "the absence of anomalies in these distributions leads us to conclude that satisfactory performance is achieved for triggering the radio array .        for each fourfold coincidence from the particle detectors ,",

    ", only a small fraction of these air shower events is expected to be accompanied by significant radio signals .",
    "recognition of radio transients is made by offline analysis using first a 37 - 70  mhz digital filter .",
    "the maximum voltage is then searched for in a 2  @xmath3s wide time window correlated to the trigger time .",
    "the average noise and its standard deviation are calculated , for each antenna and each event , in a 7.2  @xmath3s wide time window out of the signal one .",
    "more details about the resulting signal determination and the corresponding threshold criterion based on the individual event noise can be found in ref .",
    "when at least 3  antennas are flagged , a triangulation procedure calculates the arrival direction of the radio wave using a plane wavefront assumption . at this level of selection ,",
    "the counting rate of these 3-antenna events is about 1  event every 2  hours .",
    "the capability of the radio antenna device to reconstruct signal directions by such triangulation is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : allevents ] .",
    "it shows the distribution of the arrival directions of events after the trigger process described above .",
    "a substantial number of events comes from directions near the horizon and exhibit broad accumulations at a few azimuth values .",
    "they correspond to radio frequency interference ( rfi ) events and the selection discussed in the next section eliminates them .",
    "the remaining eas candidates turn out to be randomly distributed in the sky and have zenith angles below 60@xmath12 ( as expected from trigger bias ) .",
    "assuming spherical wave propagation , most of the rfi were found to originate from electrical devices located in the near environment of the nanay observatory site .",
    "specific runs with a trigger generated by the antennas have been performed and described in ref .",
    "they showed that a part of the localized sources can emit transients at specific and restricted time sequences , in contrast to the expected random behavior of eas events .",

    "our characterization of eas radio signals starts by comparing arrival times and incident directions as determined by the antenna array on the one hand , and the particle detector array on the other hand .",
    "the radio wave arrival time at any particular location is first extracted from off - line triangulation of multi - antenna events .",
    "the corresponding time distribution can then be compared with the particle front time reference supplied by the scintillator signals .",
    "the time difference distribution obtained by this procedure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dift1 ] . a sharp peak , a few tens of nanoseconds wide , is clearly visible , showing an unambiguous correlation between some radio events and particle triggers . outside of the coincidence peak , the flat distribution corresponds to accidental radio transients which are not associated with air showers but which randomly occurred in the 2  @xmath3s window where the search is conducted as described in section  3 . being uncorrelated to the particles , these events have a uniform arrival time distribution .",
    "eas candidates are those for which the arrival time difference between the two detector systems satisfies the relation @xmath13  ns , corresponding to the peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : dift1 ] .",
    "if the time - correlated events actually correspond to eas , the arrival directions reconstructed from both scintillator and antenna data should be close to each other .",

    "[ fig : dift1 ] ( black histogram ) .",
    "when selecting candidates in the peak , some chance events remain and can be clearly identified by plotting the angular difference distribution between radio pulses and particles .",
    "most of the chance events have a large angular difference value and therefore true radio - particle coincidences can be selected using a small - angle cut on this distribution .",
    "[ fig : dift ] , right - hand side , shows that the eas event angular differences fit a gaussian distribution , centered at zero degrees and multiplied by a sine function coming from the solid angle factor .",
    "the standard deviation of the corresponding gaussian is about 4  degrees .",
    "this value combines particle detector and antenna reconstruction accuracies .",
    "based on the gaussian fit , the cutoff in angular difference for true radio - particle coincidences can be set to 15@xmath12 . from the shape of the chance event distribution seen in fig .",

    "[ fig : dift1 ] can be performed taking advantage of the angular difference distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : dift ] : a third of the events ( 52 out of 164 ) in the time - coincidence peak have angular differences greater than 15@xmath12 and can thus be removed .",
    "thus , 112 events remain as true eas coincidences , while the chance event number ( 15 ) in the angular range @xmath14 results in @xmath15 count after both time and angular coincidence cuts .",
    "the corresponding signal directions , reconstructed as explained in section  3 , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : goodevents ] .",
    "the rate of chance coincidences eliminated in this way ( 52 in 100  ns ) is fully compatible with the observed uniform distribution in the 2  @xmath3s window ( about 5 every 10  ns ) .",
    "as already mentioned , these chance events occur mostly from directions close to the horizon , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : allevents ] , and are typically from rfi due to human activities or from distant thunderstorms . as will be seen in the next section ,",
    "these events are characterized by an almost uniform electric field amplitude , at least on the distance scale of our apparatus .",
    ".,width=302 ]    in order to study the radio detection performance on confirmed eas , the particle detector and radio detector acceptances have been compared as a function of the zenith angle ( see fig .  [",

    "is coming from the fall - off of the trigger device efficiency at large angle , due to simple geometrical effects and increase of the energy threshold ( see discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : acceptance ] in section  3 ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", the gross trend of the compared acceptances can be reproduced ignoring any non trivial zenith dependence originating from the antennas .",
    "more precisely , the antenna gain pattern has an attenuation of less than 2  db in the range @xmath17 .",
    "this highlights the specific and unique advantage of a radio antenna network for the observation of inclined showers .",
    "a more detailed and quantitative statement must take into account several dependences such as those of the electromagnetic signal with impact parameter  @xcite , the yield evolution in larger atmospheric densities encountered by inclined showers and the energy dependence of the antenna multiplicity .",
    "the scope of the next section , which will present the analysis of field patterns , is to bring some new valuable pieces of information regarding those dependences .        to summarize , from 2314",
    "hours data taking , 1151  coincidences ( with at least @xmath18 3-antennas ) were observed in the 2  @xmath3s trigger coincidence time - window containing 112  true eas and 52 chance coincidence events as determined by a time cut of @xmath19  ns around the peak of arrival time difference between the two types of detectors and a cutoff at 15@xmath12 in their angular difference .",
    "after application of our selection procedure , the resulting counting rate of eas events with a radio signal counterpart is close to 1  per  day .",
    "the physical characteristics of the electromagnetic field spread associated with these radio eas radio events will be now considered .",

    "more complete works and higher statistics are clearly necessary to establish the exact nature of the physical correlations detectable by the measurements of the radioelectric field features .",
    "in addition , the various sources that can influence the electric field distribution in a given event are hard to disentangle with the limited set - up described here .",
    "an upgrade with new particle detectors is already underway to provide more information on each event .",
    "they will give an independent determination of the core position and an estimate of the shower energy , invaluable information at the present stage of development of the radio technique .",
    "it has been emphasized that the observed field pattern on the various antennas constitutes a clear `` radio '' signature .",
    "this suggests that it may be possible to discriminate an eas event from a fortuitous one , using a self triggering array of radio antennas .",
    "this is one further step toward a stand - alone system that could be deployed over a large area or added to an existing surface detector such as the pierre auger observatory .",
    "the radio signals could then provide complementary information about the longitudinal development of the shower , as well as the ability to lower the energy threshold .",
    "more data and technical upgrading are planned in order to examine the contribution that the radio detection method could bring to the determination of the energy and nature of ultra high energy cosmic rays .",
    "the fact that inclined or horizontal radio waves could be efficiently detected with our set - up may be of great interest to eas detection if the electric field patterns discussed in the present study turn out to allow for a clear discrimination between eas radio events and other noise transients close to the horizon . among various particles able to generate air showers ,",
    "neutrinos are thought to probably be the only ones which could address the nature and source location of ultra energetic cosmic rays .",
    "taking into account the sensitivity of the radio detection method to inclined extensive air showers  @xcite , the presented results could considerably enlarge the scope of such studies for cosmology related phenomena .",
    "comparison of the antenna and associated electronics responses is done using the diurnal behavior of the ambient electric field in the frequency band of interest .",
    "the bulk of the radio data , which does not contain any transients , shows a steady variation of the electric field during the day , at the level of @xmath50 , with identical time evolution from one antenna to the other .",
    "this electric field component can be considered as uniform over the antenna array and used as a common reference to check for antenna gain line up . the observed deviation is smaller than @xmath51  db .    for each event , the time averaged power @xmath52 is calculated on each antenna",
    "@xmath53 in the noise window of the 37 - 70  mhz filtered signal .",
    "if this component of the signal originates from a common source which distributes it over the whole antenna array , @xmath54 will reflect the gain of the channel .",
    "[ fig : noisedist ] shows the distribution of @xmath55 for one antenna over 8 months .",
    "the distribution extends to large values attributed to sources emitting occasionally or intense solar phenomena .",
    "the peak at small values , displayed on a smaller scale in the inset , corresponds to background conditions where no coherent signal has been seen in the frequency spectra . in order to remove the large fluctuations ,",
    "a cut is applied on the data to deal only with the subset of events belonging to the peak .     on antenna l1 over the full scale in mv .",
    "an accumulation is visible at small values .",
    "higher excursions are due to occasional pollution incidents in the frequency band .",
    "the inset focuses on the peak that is of interest in our case as it corresponds to the absence of disturbances.,width=302 ]    for every antenna , when plotting @xmath56 versus time over several months , the general trend of the variation from one event to the next is an oscillation with a period of one day .",
    "no correlation with the surrounding human activity is observed .",
    "this pattern , seen on every antenna with identical phased periodicity and deviation , should be associated to a single origin which can be considered as a source shining uniformly over the antenna array .",
    "thus , having identified a common reference , relative gains can be compared .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
