    "@xcite the notion of a garside group , that captures most of the properties used in garside approach . after this seminal paper ,",
    "the notion has been extended and numerous articles have dealt with garside monoid / group structures ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite for instance ) . actually various groups can be equipped with a garside group structure .",
    "recently , krammer  @xcite , bessis  @xcite and digne - michel  @xcite have extended the notion of a garside group into the notion of a garside groupoid , which turned out to be crucial in the proof of the long - standing question of the @xmath0 property for complex reflection arrangements @xcite .",
    "the standard examples of garside groups are braid groups and their generalization , the so - called artin - tits groups of spherical type .",
    "one of the main properties of artin - tits groups is the existence of a family of distinguished subgroups , namely the _ standard parabolic subgroups _ , which are the subgroups generated by a subset of the standard generating set .",
    "in order to describe normalizers of such subgroups , we were naturally led in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to introduce a groupoid called the _",
    "ribbon groupoid_. in an unpublished paper  @xcite digne and michel prove that the ribbon groupoid of an artin - tits group of spherical type is a garside groupoid .",
    "actually , this result implicit in  @xcite , even though the notion of a garside groupoid had not been introduced yet . in  @xcite , we extended the notion of a parabolic subgroup into the framework of garside groups . our objective here is to go further and extend the notion of ribbon groupoid . we prove that in the context of garside groups , ribbon groupoids remain a garside groupoids .",
    "indeed we prove ( see next sections for definition ) that    [ thintror(a)]for every garside group  @xmath1 with a  @xmath2-structure , the positive ribbon category  @xmath3 is a garside category and the ribbon groupoid  @xmath4 is the associated garside groupoid .",
    "every artin - tits group of spherical type has a @xmath2-structure .",
    "then , theorem  [ thintror(a ) ] applied in this special case . in order to prove theorem  [ thintror(a ) ] , we consider the category  @xmath5 of subcategories of a category  @xmath6 , whose morphisms are natural transformations .",
    "it turns out that for a garside category  @xmath6 , the category  @xmath5 is not a garside category in general .",
    "however , this category shares nice properties with garside monoids ( see section  [ section2section ] for precise definition and results ) .",
    "we also provide a groupoid presentation of the ribbon groupoid  @xmath4 for every garside group  @xmath1 with a  @xmath2-structure . to obtain this presentation",
    "we investigate the quasi - centralizer  @xmath7 of  @xmath1 , that is the subgroup of  @xmath1 made of those elements that permute the atoms of the monoid  @xmath8 .",
    "in particular we generalize a result of picantin  @xcite :    [ thintror(a)2 ] for every garside group  @xmath1 , the group  @xmath7 is a finitely generated free commutative group .",
    "furthermore , we describe the normalizer of the standard parabolic subgroups by proving ( see theorem  [ theodescnormal ] ) :    [ thintroprodsemdir]let @xmath1 be a garside group .",
    "let  @xmath9 be the groupoid whose objects are the parabolic subgroups  @xmath10 of @xmath1 , whose hom - set from  @xmath10 to @xmath11 is @xmath12 , and whose composition is the product in  @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the totally disconnected groupoid whose objects are the parabolic subgroups of @xmath1 and whose vertex group at @xmath10 is @xmath10 .",
    "then , there exists a standard parabolic subgroupoid  @xmath14 of  @xmath4 such that @xmath9 is equal to the semi - direct product of groupoids  @xmath15 .",
    "this theorem generalizes  ( * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the subgroups of the vertex groups of the ribbon groupoid  @xmath4 that are generated by the atoms contained in the vertex group are garside groups .",
    "this result is similar to  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  b ) , which deals with coxeter groups .",
    "the reader may wonder what is the interest of proving that ribbon groupoids are garside groupoids .",
    "the main point is that it provides a complete description of the connection between standard parabolic subgroups .",
    "the notion of a parabolic subgroup is crucial to build important tools like the so - called _ deligne complexes _ of artin - tits groups .",
    "therefore to understand their normalizers and their mutually conjugating elements is certainly crucial .",
    "furthermore the fact that ribbon groupoids are garside groupoids shows that , even in order to study classical groups such as braid groups , the notion of a garside groupoid is natural and useful .",
    "finally , our groupoid presentations of ribbon groupoids of spherical type artin - tits groups provide garside groupoids with _ braid - like _ defining relations .",
    "these groupoids are then special among garside groupoids and therefore should provide seminal examples of garside groupoids that are not groups .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we introduce the notions of a garside groupoid and of a parabolic subgroupoid ; we investigate the category  @xmath5 . in section  3 ,",
    "we introduce the positive ribbon category associated with a garside category and prove theorem  [ thintror(a ) ] . finally , in section",
    "4 we provide a groupoid presentation of the ribbon groupoid ; along the way we prove theorem  [ thintror(a)2 ] .",
    "we conclude with the proof of theorem  [ thintroprodsemdir ] .",
    "here we set the necessary terminology on _ small categories_. in particular we recall the notion of a _ natural transformation _ between two _",
    "functors_. we introduce the central notion of a _",
