    "it is well known that nonzero magnetic fields are present in all parts of the observed universe , including galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and the intergalactic medium .",
    "however , the ultimate origin of such magnetic fields remains largely unknown @xcite .",
    "the observed magnetic fields in galaxies and clusters of galaxies , which are of the order of a microgauss in strength , can be explained by an amplification of pre - existing weak seed magnetic fields via well established astrophysical processes ( e.g. , the dynamo and/or the flux - conserving compression during the gravitational collapse ) accompanying the structure formation . as for the seed magnetic fields",
    ", they must be generated by a different mechanism .",
    "in general , there could exist two principal classes of models for the origin of the seed magnetic fields : ( i ) those connected with the processes before the structure formation in the early universe , and ( ii ) those connected with the processes that accompany the gravitational collapse associated with the structure formation .",
    "the recent observation of the magnetic fields of the order of @xmath0 in the voids @xcite , which are unlikely to be generated by any known astrophysical mechanisms , strongly supports the idea of the primordial origin of the magnetic fields @xcite and , perhaps , identifies the cosmological magnetic fields as the required seeds for the generation of the observed galactic magnetic fields .",
    "various scenarios of magnetogenesis during the inflation , reheating , electroweak and strong phase transitions were proposed and studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the main problem of magnetogenesis in the early universe is that the corresponding magnetic fields become quickly diluted during the cosmic expansion . as a result",
    ", they are unlikely to survive and serve as seeds for the generation of the galactic magnetic fields .",
    "this reasoning is based on the standard treatment of the evolution of magnetic fields in magnetohydrodynamics of a finite - resistivity relativistic plasma @xcite . while short wavelength modes are quickly erased by the magnetic diffusion due to the finite electric conductivity of the plasma",
    ", viscosity plays the dominant role in dissipation at larger scales @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is well known that magnetic fields produced after the inflation ( e.g. , generated at the electroweak epoch ) quickly become short - ranged ( deeply sub - horizon ) due to the cosmological expansion and the field dissipation  @xcite . however , for helical magnetic fields , in view of the turbulence effects , a part of their energy can be transferred from shorter to longer wavelengths (  inverse cascade \" ) and , thus , escape the dissipation due to viscous and resistive effects @xcite .    as recently demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is another mechanism of the inverse cascade in a magnetized chiral plasma which may profoundly change the evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe .",
    "the argument is based on the idea that an instability countering the dissipation can develop as a result of an abelian anomaly in the action @xcite that would lead to the generation of the hypercharge magnetic fields in the primordial plasma , which in turn gives rise to ordinary magnetic fields via the electroweak mixing .",
    "this process was believed to be limited to temperatures @xmath1  tev , as the chirality flipping reactions at lower temperatures mix left- and right - handed particles and , thus , quickly erase the chiral asymmetry in the plasma . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown , however , that a non - linear interaction between the chiral asymmetry and helical magnetic field may prolong the evolution significantly , i.e. , until the temperature drops down to about a few mev , despite the presence of the chirality flipping reactions and the magnetic diffusion . moreover , the same interaction induces an effective mechanism for transferring energy from the magnetic modes at dissipation - affected short scales to long - lived modes with long wavelengths .",
    "the underlying phenomenon is similar to the inverse cascade in ordinary magnetohydrodynamics @xcite , but driven by anomalous transport properties in the chiral plasma , rather than the turbulence .",
    "the corresponding anomalous transport properties were first obtained in the framework of the strongly coupled @xmath2 super - yang - mills theory using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite and , later , derived in general relativistic theories with anomalous chiral and/or conformal symmetries @xcite .    the mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite links the evolution of the magnetic field helicity with the divergence of the fermion axial current and the chiral magnetic effect @xcite .",
    "the latter implies , in particular , that an imbalance between the number density of the right- and left - handed fermions ( described semirigorously by the chiral chemical potential @xmath3 ) in a magnetic field @xmath4 leads to an induced electric current , @xmath5 .",
    "although magnetic field modes with nonzero wave vectors were considered , only the space - averaged chiral anomaly equation and a constant chiral chemical potential were utilized in the analysis of ref .",

    "<S> by making use of a simple model that captures the key features of the anomalous maxwell equations , we study the role of inhomogeneities on the evolution of magnetic fields in a chiral plasma . </S>",
    "<S> we find that inhomogeneities of the chiral asymmetry by themselves do not prevent the anomaly - driven inverse cascade and , as in the homogeneous case , the magnetic helicity is transferred from shorter to longer wavelength helical modes of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also find that the evolution appears to be sensitive to the effects of diffusion . in the case </S>",
    "<S> when diffusion is negligible , the inverse cascade slows down considerably compared to the homogeneous scenario . in the case of the primordial plasma , though , we find that the diffusion is substantial and efficiently suppresses chiral asymmetry inhomogeneities . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the inverse cascade proceeds practically in the same way as in the chirally homogeneous model . </S>"
