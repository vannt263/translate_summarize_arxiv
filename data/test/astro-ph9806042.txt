    "the many - body calculations of the ground state energy of the matter in neutron stars imply an internal structure represented by succession of phase transitions as one moves from the surface to higher densities .",
    "the outer envelope of highly compressed solid melts into a homogeneous neutron - proton - electron fermi liquid at roughly half the nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "the phase transition is an analog of the liquid - solid phase transition , is of the first order , and is signalled by an instability of the continuum proton liquid in the core against clustering into heavy nuclei in the crust ( pethick , ravenhall & lorenz 1995 ) . in our subsequent discussion of the vortex - interface interaction",
    "we shall mainly focus on the crust - core interface and shall identify its location according to this criterion .",
    "the internal interface bounding the superfluid , superconducting neutron - proton liquid at supranuclear densities may correspond to either disappearance of the superfluidity of the nucleonic matter or onset of a kaon - condensed phase ( e.g. brown , et al 1994 ; and pandharipande , pethick & thorsson 1995 ) or deconfined quark plasma ( e.g. glendenning 1996 and references therein ) . in view of the uncertainties involved in the physics of high - density nuclear matter",
    ", we shall only briefly discuss the vortex interactions with internal interfaces .",
    "the density profiles of the superfluid phases in a neutron stars do not coincide with the profiles of various phases of dense matter in general .",
    "the boundaries of the latter phases thus may play an important role in the dynamics of superfluids which support the vortex lattice state .",
    "for example , the rotation of neutrons is supported by a feynman - onsager vortex lattice state and their interaction with the phase boundaries can affect their dynamics ; the same applies to the proton vortex lattices , carrying the magnetic flux through the superconducting proton liquid .    in the case of laboratory superfluids",
    "the vortex - interface interactions have been studied both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "an example is the onset of the resistive state in type - ii superconductors when a current passes perpendicular to the applied magnetic field .",
    "the value of the critical current of sufficiently clean samples , where the pinning effects are negligible , remains finite , and is determined by the bean - livingstone barrier acting on the vortex lattice at the boundary .",
    "experimental measurements on nb by lowell ( 1968 ) confirmed the existence of the barrier ; a theoretical discussion can be found , for example , in de gennes ( 1966 ) .",
    "an example of manifestation of vortex - interface interaction in the neutral superfluids is the dependence of the lower critical velocity of vortex nucleation in superfluid @xmath0he on the roughness of the vessel inner surface ( see e.g. sonin & krusius 1994 ) .    in this paper",
    "we derive the vortex interface intercations occurring at the boundaries of the superfluid phases in neutron stars , and examine the conditions under which this type of interaction could be responsible for the phenomenon of glitches in the spins of pulsars .",
    "any theoretical model should explain the following observational facts : ( i ) short spin - up time - scales , which are observed to be less than 120  s in the vela pulsar b0833 - 45 and less than an hour in the crab pulsar b0531 + 21 ; ( ii ) magnitudes of the jumps in the rotation and spin - down rates , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively ; and ( iii ) the origin of the instability driving a glitch , along with characteristic intervals between glitches for a given pulsar ; the latter times - cales range from several months to several years depending on the object .",
    "the items ( i)-(iii ) will be addressed here using the vortex cluster model for the superfluid core dynamics ( sedrakian et al 1995a , b hereafter papers i and ii ) .",
    "the physical picture is the following . in the interjump epoch",
    "a neutron star is decelerating ; consequently the vortex lattice in the superfluid core is expanding and the peripheral vortices attempt to cross the crust - core boundary .",
    "the crust - superfluid core interface acts as a potential barrier to the proton vortices in the superfluid core that approach this boundary .",
    "if the repulsive component of the force , derived from the potential , is added to the force balance condition for the neutron vortices , it gives rise to an imbalance along the radial direction - the component of the friction force in this direction drops to zero , while the effective magnus force becomes proportional to the difference between the velocities of the normal and superfluid components .",
    "the deceleration of the star will lead to a growth of this force until the proton vortices are able to annihilate at the interface .",
    "the neutron vortices will relax to their equilibrium positions , imparting angular momentum from the superfluid to the normal component thus , producing a pulsar macrojump . this picture is akin to the unpinning model of anderson & itoh ( 1975 ) , except that the interaction does not involve the bulk of the superfluid , but rather its layer at the phase boundary .",
    "the latter setup has the advantage of a coherent onset of the glitch and does not require repinning .",
    "a brief sketch of this macrojump generation mechanism has been given elsewhere ( sedrakian & cordes 1998 ) .",
    "the first suggested mechanisms for triggering the glitches were based on the idea of starquakes ( ruderman 1969 ; smoluchowski & welch 1970 ; baym & pines 1971 ; carter & quintana 1975 ) .",
    "these models employed the idea of discontinuous readjustments of the shape of the star as it spins down under external dissipative torques .",
    "however , the possibilities of the explanation of the recurrence rate of glitches in the vela and crab pulsars within these models are severely limited ; e.g. baym & pines ( 1971 ) find that the recurrence time is @xmath3 yr and @xmath4 yr for the vela and crab pulsars , respectively , if these are assumed to be 1.4 @xmath5 neutron stars .",
    "instabilities associated with the superfluid component were proposed as being caused by long - living persistent currents and sudden annihilation of excess vortices ( packard 1972 ) .",
    "a specific mechanism for the occurrence of the instability was proposed by anderson & itoh ( 1975 ) , who argued that glitches occur through the pinning and unpinning of vortices in neutron star crusts [ see also anderson et al ( 1982 ) and itoh ( 1983 ) ] .",
    "the required moment of inertia that can be accumulated in the interglitch period and the mechanisms for the unpinning are suitable for the large glitches observed in vela - type pulsars ( alpar et al 1981 , 1993 , link & epstein 1991 ) .",
    "however the subsequent repinning , which is required for the recurrence of glitches in this model , is still not well understood ( shaham 1980 , sedrakian 1995 ) .",
    "jones ( 1991a,1993 ) argued that the superfluid is not pinned in the whole bulk of the crusts , and the discontinuous relocation of the interface between the phases with pinned and unpinned vortices can trigger a glitch .",
    "ruderman ( 1991 ) suggested that a spinning - down superfluid neutron star would strain the crust beyond its elastic yield strength , which would lead to crust cracking , resulting in glitches with magnitude and recurrence rate compatible with those observed .",
    "thermal effects as a cause of a glitch were discussed by greenstein ( 1979 ) .",
    "sudden perturbation of the inner crust temperature , leading to an increase of the frictional coupling between the superfluid and the crust , have beed simulated by link & epstein ( 1996 ) , who find spin - ups compatible with the glitches in the crab and vela pulsars .",
    "the effects of the exotic nuclear structure environment of the inner crust ( e.g. lorenz , revenhall & pethick 1993 ) on the vortex dynamics have been considered by mochizuki , oyamatsu & izuyama ( 1997 ) , who find that nuclear rod structure can pin a vortex line and can be an origin of vortex accumulation , leading to a glitch in the spirit of the anderson - itoh model .    note that the glitch generation mechanisms , apart from describing the transients , lend themselves as candidates for generation of the sustained spin fluctuation processes manifested as ` timing noise ' ( cordes & greenstein 1981 , cordes , downs & krause - polstorff 1988 and references therein ) .",
    "simple amplitude down - scaling of the transients is not sufficient , however , because the transients are biased towards one sign of the spin - fluctuation ( e.g. spin - up ) , while the timing noise fluctuations require deviations of both signs .      in section 2",
    "we derive general expressions for the vortex - interface interaction in three - velocity superfluid hydrodynamics and give order - of - magnitude estimates of the interaction strength at the crust - core interface .",
    "in section 3 the collective interaction effects - the cluster - interface interaction - are discussed and a comparison with the magnus force needed to build - up an instability is made .",
    "the microscopic time - scales relevant for the spin - up problem are considered in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is a summary of our results .",
    "we shall focus further on the dynamics of the superfluid outer core , where both the neutrons and the protons are in the superfluid state , and apply the newtonian version of the superfluid hydrodynamics [ a detailed exposition of the theory and references to earlier work can be found in mendell & lindblom ( 1991 ) , mendell ( 1991 ) , and paper i ] .",
    "the relativistic counterparts of superfluid hydrodynamic equations have been made available recently ( langlouis , sedrakian , carter 1998 , carter & langlouis 1998 ) ; their application to the problem at hand , however , is not straightforward and we shall continue to work entierly in the newtonian limit .    to keep the discussion general , the ground state structure of vortex lattices will not be specified until secton 3 .",
    "we will only assume that the protons form a continuum of single particle states and that they are in the mixed type ii superconducting state .",
    "as an outer interface bounding the neutron - proton superconducting phase we shall consider the crust - core interface , the location of which is identified with either the density of transition of the protons from a continuum to clustered state or the vanishing of neutron / proton superfluidity with decreasing density . for definiteness we shall proceed with the first condition ,",
    "i.e. assume that the external interface is located at the position where the protons become unstable against clustering into nuclei .",
    "in that case the transition is first - order , and the interface is of the order of one nuclear spacing thick , in analogy with an ordinary liquid - solid interface ( pethick , ravenhall & lorenz 1995 ) .",
    "the location of the inner core - outer core interface will be identified with the disappearance of the superconducting state of neutrons or protons with increasing density . for brevity",
    "we shall sometimes refer to these interfaces as the external and internal interfaces , respectively .",
    "the bose condensation of mesons provides another possibility , that the inner interface is located at the density of the onset of the developed condensate .",
    "to set up the problem , assume that the crust supports a certain magnetic field of strength @xmath6 : a plausible origin for such a field could be the thermal battery effect ( blandford , applegate & hernquist 1983 , urpin , levshakov & yakovlev 1986 ) or the natal dynamo effect ( duncan & thompson 1993 ) .",
    "the type ii superconducting protons in the core are assumed to be in the mixed state .",
    "the magnetic field , @xmath7 , of quantum vortices in the superfluid core is governed by the london equation for charged - neutral superfluid mixtures ( vardanian & sedrakian 1981 ; alpar , langer & sauls 1984 ; sauls 1989 ) : [ london ] _",

    "the second term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ london ] ) takes into account the attractive part of the vortex - interface interaction in terms of vortex images of opposite sign , which are located symmetrically with respect to the crust - core interface .",
    "the total field at the crust - core interface , @xmath15 , is the superposition of the solution of equation ( [ london ] ) , [ bvortex ] b_v & = & _ _ + & & _ q , and the induction field @xmath16 set up by the crustal field @xmath17 , which exponentially penetrates in the superfluid core to a scale of the order of @xmath8 ; ( here and below the @xmath18 are the modified bessel functions . )",
    "the magnetic field distribution with the proper boundary condition at the interface allows one to calculate the relevant part of the gibbs free energy of the system @xmath19 , where the free - energy is [ gibbs ] f&= & ds + & + & b  dv .",
    "the surface integration is over the crust - core interface , while the bulk integration involves the superfluid core region .",
    "assume the vortex lattice plane is the @xmath20-plane of cartesian system of coordinates , with the interface being the @xmath21-plane , and the circulation vectors in the superfluid core region are in the positive @xmath22-direction ; the half - plane @xmath23 corresponds to the crust while @xmath24 corresponds to the superfluid core ; see fig",

    "note that in the self - energy term we introduced a cut - off @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",

    "q(x^(+))&=&\\ { + & + & _  _ q^}. the first term in equation ( [ force ] ) corresponds to the repulsive force acting between the vortex magnetic flux and the crustal magnetic field .",
    "it can also be interpreted as a lorentz force resulting from superposition of velocity fields of the vortex and the surface meissner currents ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the second term is the force between the vortex and its image , which is attractive because of oppositely directed circulation vectors .",
    "the last two terms correspond to vortex - vortex and vortex - image interactions , respectively .",
    "to estimate the magnitude and asymptotics of the vortex - interface interaction , consider a single vortex with flux @xmath36 . from equation ( [ force ] ) we find [ reduced_force ] f()= , where the dimensionless variables are defined as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the function @xmath42 is plotted in fig . 2 for @xmath43 . for large distances ( @xmath44 ) the exponential ( repulsive ) term dominates , because in this limit the second term goes to zero more rapidly , [ @xmath45 . for small distances",
    "the second ( attractive ) term in equation ( [ force ] ) dominates ; note that it should be cut - off at @xmath46 by replacing @xmath47 by @xmath48 .",
    "the repulsive part of the vortex - crust - core interface interaction , which dominates at large distances acts as a potential barrier to a vortex approaching the boundary , and thus prevents its continuous decay on the interface .",
    "if the magnitude of the crustal magnetic field is decreased , the potential barrier disappears in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "the crust - core interface density will be identified with the density of separation of two phases where the protons are clustered in the nuclei ( crust ) and are in the continuum state ( core ) .",
    "following pethick , ravenhall & lorenz ( 1995 ) we adopt the phase transition density @xmath50 g @xmath51 .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the phase transition found in pethick , ravenhall & lorenz ( 1995 ) is an analog of the ordinary first - order liquid - solid phase transition and the interface between the phases is one nuclear spacing thick .",
    "the stability of the interface requires a positive curvature energy associate with the interface between two phases ; the system , therefore , will tend to minimize the surface of the interface .",
    "the typical scale of non - homogeneity should be the largest of the two relevant scales in the problem - the actual size of the nuclei and the size of the nuclear spacing .",
    "both length scales are of the order of 30 - 50 fm . on the other hand , the interaction range , as can be seen from fig .",
    "2 , is on order of 5 - 10 @xmath8 which translates into 1 - 5 @xmath52 fm for the value @xmath53 fm found at @xmath54 ( see table 2 later ) . as the interaction range exceeds the thickness of the interface by two orders of magnitude , the finite size of the interface can be ignored in the calculation of the force acting a vortex , which justifies the treatment above . using the same transition density as above",
    ", we find @xmath55 g , @xmath56 dyn @xmath57 for @xmath58 fm . assuming a conventional value for the crustal magnetic field @xmath59 g , we obtain @xmath60 and the maximum value of the reduced force @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "this translates to the maximal repulsive force @xmath63 dyn @xmath57 . in general , the magnitude of the crustal magnetic field at the crust - core interface for different objects can vary in a reasonable range , @xmath64 g , though values beyond both extremes can not be excluded . for further reference the values of the maximal force for different applied magnetic fields",
    "are given in table 1 .",
    "in the range of interest , the maximal force depends quadratically on magnitude of the crustal magnetic field .",
    ".values of the maximal force for different applied magnetic fields . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]    + this type of observation could support our model , because this type of behaviour can not be understood within known models of glitch generation .",
    "2 .   for millisecond pulsars with low magnetic fields ( @xmath65 g )",
    "the vortex - interface interaction force would be 6 orders of magnitude lower than for conventional pulsars ( @xmath66 g ) , implying interjump periods comparable to the evolutionary time - scales and , therefore , a marginal glitch activity .",
    "the occurrence of the glitch would require small changes in the geometry of the compound field of the pulsar and possibly changes in the inclination angle of the dipole field .",
    "the location of the barrier at a fixed interface ( with the same physical parameters for the whole system ) and the homogeneity of the environment of the superfluid phase suggests consistency in the conditions at the onset of instability driving the glitch , which appears to be one of the advantages of the present model .",
    "4 .   the thermal effects do not appear as an input ; the relase of the self - energy of the vortex lines at the crust - core boundary might , however , provide a considerable heat flux ( and the stationary situation is discussed in sedrakian & sedrakian 1993 ) . thermal pulse observation associated with a glitch",
    "( eichler & cheng 1989 , van riper , epstein & miller 1991 , chong & cheng 1994 , hirano et al 1997 ) can be caused by the vortex annihilation at the crust core boundary .",
    "this type of heating may serve as an input for the thermally activated glitches ( link & epstein 1996 ) .",
    "the model does not invoke any type of quake activity , but may trigger magnetic field configuration changes , which may induce plate tectonic activity ( ruderman 1991 ) .",
    "the opposite may be true , i.e. the plate tectonic activity ( ruderman 1991 ) could allow the proton vortices to overcome the barrier and trigger a runaway instability at the the crust core interface .    to summarize , a potential barrier , resulting from magnetic interaction between the proton vortices and the crustal magnetic field at the crust - core interface , is suggested as the possible mechanism for the generation of pulsar glitches .",
    "it is shown that the force derived from that potential can sustain a magnus force in an interjump period within a superfluid region with sufficient moment of inertia and appropriate dynamical coupling times in order to generate a large glitch , like those observed in the vela - type pulsars .",
