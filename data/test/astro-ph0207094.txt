    "during outburst episodes , neutron star x - ray transients can be detected at luminosities of @xmath8 erg s@xmath2  ( e.g. , chen , shrader , & livio 1997 ) . during those outbursts , the transients are very similar to the persistent sources with respect to their x - ray properties .",
    "the high x - ray luminosity is very likely due to the accretion of matter onto the neutron star .",
    "these transients are characterized by their bright outbursts , but most of the time they spend in a quiescent state in which they are orders of magnitude dimmer at all wavelengths .",
    "fortunately , using sensitive imaging instruments , we are still able to detect them at x - ray luminosities of @xmath9 erg s@xmath2  ( e.g. , van paradijs et al . 1987 ; asai et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) . the high sensitivity camera s aboard _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ are well suited to detect quiescent systems and obtain good x - ray spectra for the brightest systems ( see , e.g. , daigne et al . 2002 ; in t zand et al .",
    "2001 ; rutledge et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ; wijnands et al .",
    "2001b , 2002b ) . to explain the low quiescent x - ray properties ,",
    "several models have been developed .",
    "for example , the x - rays could be due to the residual accretion of matter onto the neutron star or magnetospheric boundary , or the pulsar emission mechanism might be active ( see , e.g. , stella et al .",
    "1994 ; corbet 1996 ; campana et al .",
    "1998b ; menou et al . 1999",
    "; campana & stella 2000 ; menou & mcclintock 2001 ) .",
    "currently the most successful model is that in which the x - rays are due to the thermal emission from the neutron star surface , which will be referred to as the cooling neutron star model.      in the cooling neutron star model ( e.g. , van paradijs et al .",
    "1987 ; campana et al . 1998b",
    "; brown , bildsten , & rutledge 1998 and references therein ) the emitted radiation below a few kev is thermal emission originating from the neutron star surface .",
    "brown et al . ( 1998 ) argued that the neutron star core is heated by the nuclear reactions occurring deep in the crust when the star is accreting and this heat is released as thermal emission during quiescence .",
    "if the quiescent emission is dominated by the thermal emission of the cooling neutron star , then the quiescent luminosity should depend on the time averaged ( over @xmath10 years ) accretion luminosity of the system ( campana et al .",
    "1998b ; brown et al .",
    "thus , the quiescent luminosities of the detected systems can directly be compared with the predicted ones obtained from estimates of the long term accretion history of the sources .",
    "the neutron star cooling model also gives clear predictions for the spectral shape of the quiescent x - ray spectrum , which should be thermal .",
    "although a simple blackbody model can be fitted to the data , the obtained radii of the emitting regions ( of the order of only a few kilometers ) are considerably lower than the predicted radii of neutron stars ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) . to circumvent this discrepancy",
    ", it has been proposed that quiescent neutron star systems do not emit a true blackbody spectrum but a modified one ( brown et al . 1998 ) . when using blackbody models to fit such modified spectra , the effective temperatures will be overestimated and the emitting areas underestimated . by fitting more realistic models , such as the so - called neutron star atmosphere models",
    "( the non - magnetic models are appropriate for quiescent neutron star systems ; e.g. , zavlin , pavlov , & shibanov 1996 ) , to the x - ray data , emitting radii were obtained which are consistent with the expected radii of neutron stars ( rutledge et al . 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "the cooling neutron star model can not fully explain all characteristics of the quiescent emission .",
    "for example , the power - law shaped spectral component which dominates the quiescent spectra above a few kev in several systems ( e.g. , asai et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ; campana et al .",
    "1998a ) can not be explained by the cooling models . it is conceivable that this component might be described by one or more of the alternative models discussed above ( in particular the residual accretion model ) .",
    "however , the observational results on this component and our understanding of its nature are very limited .",
    "recently , a sub - group of neutron star x - ray transients has received extra attention because of their potential to test the cooling neutron star model and to determine some of the physical properties of the neutron star crust and core .",
    "these particular transients do not have traditional outbursts which only last weeks to at most a few months , but instead they stay active for several years to over a decade ( and maybe even longer ) .",
    "these systems have been called long - duration transients or quasi - persistent sources ( e.g. , wijnands et al . 2001b , wijnands 2002 ) .",
    "the long outburst behavior of those sources might be related to the extended episodes ( several months to several years ) of low - level activity seen in other transients usually after they have exhibited bright outbursts ( e.g. , in 4u 163047 , aql x-1 , 4u 160852 , or sax j1808.43658 ; kuulkers et al .",
    "1997 ; bradt et al .",
    "2000 ; wijnands et al .",
    "2001c ; wachter et al . 2002 ) , although those episodes are generally less luminous ( @xmath11 erg s@xmath2 ) than the outbursts of the quasi - persistent sources ( @xmath12 erg s@xmath2 ) .    in ordinary ( i.e. , short - duration )",
    "transients , the accretion of matter will have only a very minor effect on the thermal state of the crust , but for these quasi - persistent sources the prolonged accretion episodes can heat the crust to high temperatures , considerably higher than that of the neutron star core ( see rutledge et al .",
    "2002 ) . when those systems become quiescent again , it might take years to decades for the crust to return to thermal equilibrium with the core and the initial quiescent properties of those systems might be dominated by the crust emission and not by the state of the core ( as is the case in ordinary transients ) . monitoring observations of those systems in quiescence",
    "might even allow one to follow the cooling of the crust from which the heat conductivity of the crust can be determined ( rutledge et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "recently , one of the quasi - persistent systems ( ks 1731260 ) suddenly turned off after having actively accreted for over 12.5 years .",

    ". an _ xmm - newton _ observation of this system performed about half a year after the _ chandra _ observation , showed that the system had declined by a factor of @xmath143 in luminosity ( wijnands et al .",
    "if the quiescent emission from this system was dominated by the state of the crust , the decrease in luminosity within half a year strongly indicates that the crust must have a high heat conductivity ( wijnands et al .",
    "2002b ; using the cooling curves calculated for this system by rutledge et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the core temperature is expected to be lower than the crust temperature and the luminosity measured with _",
    "xmm - newton _ can be used as an upper limit on the core luminosity .",
    "the quiescent luminosity of ks 1731260 is much lower than expected from its long term accretion history , and can only be explained in terms of the standard cooling model if this system is dormant for at least several thousand of years between outbursts ( assuming all outbursts of this system are very similar to the last one , which might not be a valid assumption ; wijnands et al .",
    "2001b ; rutledge et al .",

    "it clearly shows an eclipse , which is very likely due to the obscuration of the inner x - ray emitting region by the companion star ( cycle 30823 using the linear ephemeris of oosterbroek et al .",
    "the eclipse duration ( 842@xmath1990 seconds ) and the egress and ingress times ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 seconds , respectively ) have been calculated using the method outlined by nowak et al .",
    "the obtained eclipse duration is consistent with that observed during outburst ( @xmath22 seconds ; wachter et al .",
    "eclipses in quiescence have also been observed for the neutron star transient 4u 2129 + 47 ( nowak et al .",
    "2002 ) and from the likely neutron star transient x5 in the globular cluster 47 tuc ( heinke et al . 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "besides the eclipse , the _ chandra_/acis - s light curve also shows clear dipping behavior a few kiloseconds before the eclipse , which again is very similar to 4u 2129 + 47 and x5 in 47 tuc .",
    "those dips might be due to the same process causing the dipping behavior of the source when it is still actively accreting : the dips might be due to obscuration of the central x - ray source by a large structure in the outer accretion disk , possible the impact point of the accretion stream from the companion star and the accretion disk ( see also nowak et al .",
    "2002 and heinke et al . 2001 , 2002 for a discussion about the dips for 4u 2129 + 47 and x5 , respectively ) .",
    "the decrease in count rate would then be due to an increase in the absorption column in front of the central x - ray source .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested by examining the spectrum of the source in and outside the dip ( see   [ section : dipspectrum ] ) .",
    "note that this hypothesis requires that residual disks are still present in quiescence without accretion occurring onto the neutron stars .",
    "indeed such residual disks are expected from the disk instability model to explain x - ray outbursts ( see lasota 2001 for a review ) and independent proof for such disks came from optical observations from quiescent x - ray transients ( e.g. , mcclintock & remillard 2000 ) .      c    all x - ray spectra were extracted using a circle with @xmath23 in radius on the position of the source as determined using _ wavdetect _ and the background data were obtained by using an annulus on the source position with an inner radius of @xmath24 and an outer one of @xmath25 .",
    "all obtained spectra were rebinned using the ftools tool _ grppha _ into bins with a minimum of 15 counts per bin and we fitted the spectrum using xspec ( version 11.1 ; arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "we extracted spectra for the part of the observation during which the source was relatively stable ( called the persistent spectrum ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipse ] ; @xmath26 ksec of data ) and for the part during the dips ( called the dip spectrum ; fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipse ] ; a total of @xmath143.8 ksec of data ) .",
    "many single component models fit the persistent spectrum well ; however , the quiescent spectra of neutron star x - ray transients are most often fit with a blackbody model or a neutron star atmosphere model .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on those two models , using the model from zavlin et al . 1996 ( the non - magnetic case ) as the atmosphere model . theoretically it is expected that the emerging spectrum should resemble that assumed by the atmosphere model ( e.g. , brown et al .",
    "1998 ) , however , observationally both the atmosphere model and the black body model produce equally satisfactory fits to the data . because also our data do not allow for a rejection of the blackbody model , and to allow comparison with previous results on the quiescent spectra of neutron star x - ray transients , we also report the blackbody results . in certain systems , a power - law tail above a few kev was found , and although such a power - law component was not required by the data , we fitted the spectra with the above two models including a power - law component with a photon index of 1 or 2 to obtain an upper limit on this component .",
    "c    the spectral results are listed in table  [ tab : spectrum ] and the persistent spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the column density @xmath27  was left free in the fits and the obtained value is in the range of what has been observed previously for this source during outburst using _ bepposax _ and _ xmm - newton _ ( @xmath28 @xmath1 ; oosterbroek et al . 2001 ; sidoli et al .",
    "both the blackbody and the atmosphere model fit the data well and the best - fit temperature was @xmath140.3 kev for the blackbody fits and @xmath140.1 kev for the atmosphere model .",
    "when assuming a distance of 10 kpc , the radius for the emitting area was only a few kilometers using the blackbody model which is lower than the theoretical expected radius for a neutron star .",
    "the atmosphere model gave radii that were consistent with those expected if the emission arose from the neutron star and the complete surface was radiating , favoring the atmosphere model .",
    "for larger assumed distances the radii would increase , although the distance has to be unrealistically large ( @xmath29 kpc ) for the radius obtained via the black - body model to become consistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "the atmosphere model does not allow for the distance to become much larger than assumed because the obtained radius will quickly be inconsistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "the obtained unabsorbed 0.510 kev fluxes were between 3.0 and 3.6 @xmath30 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 , resulting in a luminosity of @xmath31 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "when including a power - law component in the fit , it could not be detected significantly and its 0.510 kev flux could be constrained to be less than about 25%35% ( depending on photon index ) of the 0.510 kev blackbody flux or that of the atmosphere component .    c      due to the low statistics of the dip data , the source spectrum during the dip could not be constrained by using only the dip data . however , by assuming that the decrease in count rate is only due to an increase in absorption by obscuring material ( as has been found during outburst ; e.g. , oosterbroek et al .",
    "2001 ; sidoli et al .",
    "2001 ) , we fitted the persistent spectrum and the dip spectrum simultaneously using the same blackbody or atmosphere model but with different column densities .",
    "the spectral results are also listed in table  [ tab : spectrum ] .",
    "the spectral parameters of the persistent emission were consistent with those obtained when only fitting the persistent emission spectrum , although the measured fluxes tend to be slightly lower .",
    "the column density of the dip spectrum is higher ( by a factor of two ) than that obtained for the persistent emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : nh ] shows the error ellipse of the column density of the persistent emission spectrum versus that of the dip spectrum .",
    "clearly , at high significance it is rejected that the column density of the dip spectrum is identical to that of the persistent emission .",
    "a systematic trend is clearly seen that the dip column density is always larger than that of the persistent emission ( a similar result is obtained when the atmosphere model is used instead of the blackbody model ) .",
    "our results show that our data are consistent with a scenario in which the intrinsic source spectrum remains identical throughout the _ chandra _ observation , and that the decrease in count rate during the dip is due to an increase in absorption , but we can not exclude other mechanisms responsible for the count rate decrease .",
    "for example , the data are also consistent with a decrease in luminosity without a change in spectral shape or with a decrease of the temperature .",
    "the observation of a dip in the quiescent x - ray light curve of mxb 165929 might imply that absorption by the outer disk also could occur , albeit less strong , during the orbital phases where no dips are observe , possibly effecting the spectral fits of the persistent emission .",
    "however , during the outburst phase of the source type - i x - ray bursts were observed and nearly - coherent oscillations during those bursts were seen ( wijnands et al .",
    "2001a ) , implying that the neutron star is observed directly .",
    "very likely , this will also be true during quiescence .",
    "furthermore , the measured column density toward the source from the persistent quiescent emission is rather low and consistent with other estimates and measurements ( dickey & lockman 1990 ; oosterbroek et al . 2001",
    "; sidoli et al .",
    "2001 ) making additional absorption by the outer disk also unlikely .",
    "therefore , we conclude that very likely we see the neutron star directly at orbital phases outside the dip and the eclipse , and our spectral results can directly be compared with the results obtained from other quiescent neutron star transients which have lower binary inclination than mxb 165929 .",
    "we have presented a _ chandra _ observation of mxb 165929 performed @xmath145 weeks after the last clear detection of the source with the _ rxte_/pca ( indicating that at that time the source was still actively accreting ; wijnands et al .",
    "2002a ) . during our _ chandra",
    "_ observation , we detected the source at a luminosity of @xmath32 erg s@xmath2 , and its spectrum could be well described by a thermal component ( either a blackbody model or a neutron star atmosphere model ) .",
    "the obtained luminosity and the shape of the x - ray spectrum of mxb 165929 resemble those obtained for other quiescent neutron star systems , strongly suggesting that the source was quiescent during our _ chandra _ observation .      as argued by rutledge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , for systems which are actively accreting for long periods , the crust might have been heated to very high temperatures ( probably considerably higher than that of the core ) and the quiescent properties might be dominated by the thermal state of the crust rather than that of the core .",
    "although the duration of the accretion episode of mxb 165929 is considerably shorter ( factor of @xmath145 ) than that of ks 1731260 or x 1732304 ( both of which had accretion episodes of more than a decade ; wijnands et al .",
    "2001b ; wijnands et al .",
    "2002b ; see also guainazzi , parmar , & oosterbroek 1999 for x 1732304 ) , here we assume that the 2.5 year accretion episode of mxb 165929 has had a considerable effect on the state of the crust , similar to what has been argued for ks 1731260 ( rutledge et al .",
    "2002 ; although likely less extreme ) , .",
    "this assumption is also supported by the fact that in the early 1990 s , the source could not be detected in quiescence using a _",

    "2001 ) which is about an order of magnitude lower than the luminosity we have detected during our _ chandra _ observation .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the _ chandra _ quiescent luminosity is not the rock bottom quiescent luminosity of this system and the quiescent properties for mxb 165929 during the _ chandra _ observation were dominated by that of the crust and not by the core . as an upper limit on the flux due to the cooling neutron star core",

    "( 2001 ) , we inferred ( by simulating the spectrum in xspec ) that the bolometric luminosity can be at least a factor of two larger .",
    "however , the luminosity itself was variable ( by a factor of a few ; fig .",

    ".    the 19992001 outburst could be an atypical one for mxb 165929 and previous outbursts might have been less bright and/or less long ( i.e. , more like those of the ordinary transients ) .",

    "1983 ) in optical ( v@xmath372223 ) and with _ hakucho _ ( no x - ray upper limits were provided ) . prior to 1976 , the source might have also been detected during the period 1971 to 1973 using _",
    "( classified as 4u 170430 ; forman et al . 1978 )",
    ", although this identification with mxb 165929 is not certain and we will assume that they are two different objects ( if 4u 170430 can be identified with mxb 165929 then the source might have exhibited an extra outburst during that period or it might have been active for a period of @xmath147 years ) .",
    "the exact fluxes during the observations in the period october 1976 to early july 1979 are in the range 1 to 6 @xmath38 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 , but they have large uncertainties because the exact energy range was not always quoted ( if quoted it was 110 kev or 210 kev ) , it was unclear if the fluxes were absorbed or unabsorbed , and the assumed spectral shape was not always similar ( often assumed to be crab like ) and quite different than observed with _ bepposax _ and _ xmm - newton _ during the 19992001 outburst ( oosterbroek et al .",
    "2001 ; sidoli et al .",
    "however , we will assume that all fluxes are for the 210 kev range and unabsorbed , and a bolometric flux of about twice the quoted values ( as inferred above for the _ bepposax _ results on mxb 165929 ) .",
    "therefore , during the outburst in the late 1970 s , the source was actively accreting for a period of at least @xmath142.5 years at a bolometric flux level of 2 to 12 @xmath39 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 .",
    "although quite uncertain , this is remarkably similar to the values of the 19992001 outburst and for simplicity we assume that the typical outburst duration is 2.5 years and that the bolometric fluxes during outburst is 510 @xmath40 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 .    using the brown et al .",
    "( 1998 ) model ( assuming standard cooling processes ) , the predicted quiescent flux @xmath41 for this source would then be ( wijnands et al .",
    "2001b ; see also rutledge et al .",
    "2002 ) @xmath42 , with @xmath43 the average flux during outburst ( 510 @xmath40 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 ) , @xmath44 the average time the source is in outburst ( 2.5 years ) , and @xmath45 the average time the source is in quiescence ( @xmath1421 year ) .",
    "this results in a predicted quiescent flux of 48 @xmath30 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 .",
    "remarkably , this value is very similar to the quiescent flux observed during our _ chandra _ observations .",
    "however , as explained above , based on the _ rosat _ non - detection of the source , the core flux is likely at least an order of magnitude lower than this , which would make the predicted core flux considerably higher than that truly originating from the core .",
    "similar to ks 1731260 ( wijnands et al .",
    "2001b , 2002b ) this low core flux ( and thus temperature ) might be due to enhanced core cooling instead of the assumed standard core cooling in the brown et al .",
    "( 1998 ) model .",
    "despite the fact that the last two outburst episodes are likely of similar duration , it can not be excluded that they are not typical for the source and that most of the time mxb 165929 exhibits short duration outbursts .",
    "if the typical outburst duration of mxb 165929 is not 2.5 years but instead 0.25 years ( 3 months ) or shorter , then the predicted quiescent flux will be consistent ( within the uncertainties of the model and assumptions ) with the _ rosat _ upper limit .",
    "the higher _ chandra _ quiescent luminosity is again due to the state of the crust which should be considerably heated during the long accretion episode .",
    "if during the _ chandra _ observation the x - ray emission was dominated by thermal emission from the crust , then further quiescent observations of mxb 165929 will enable studies of the cooling of the crust in this system .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "flux upper limit suggests that the crust flux should eventually decrease to at least this level .",
    "when the crust will be thermally relaxed with the core , no significant further decrease of the quiescent flux is expected and from this bottom flux level the state of the core can be inferred from which the cooling models can be better constrained . for ks 1731260 it had already been found that its quiescent luminosity decreased by a factor of 3 within half a year time ( likely due to a temperature decrease ) , indicating a highly conductive crust ( wijnands et al .",
    "it would be of interest to determine if such a rapid cooling will also be observed for mxb 165929 or if the neutron star crust in this system has a significantly lower conductivity .    in the latter case",
    ", the system should be at the _ chandra _ quiescent luminosity for several years to decades .",
    "using the fact that 13 years after the 19761978 outburst _ rosat _ observed an order of magnitude lower quiescent luminosity we might set already an upper limit on the crust cooling time . when assuming that shortly after the end of the 19761978 outburst the quiescent luminosity was similar to our measured _",
    "luminosity , the cooling time of the crust is at least about a factor of 10 in luminosity per decade . due to differences in quiescent times , outburst times , and the time averaged accretion rates between mxb 165929 and ks 1731260 the cooling curves calculated for ks 1731260 by rutledge et al . ( 2002 ) can not be used for mxb 165929 . however , if those mxb 165929 cooling curves resemble those of ks 1731260 , then tentatively it might be concluded that also the neutron star crust in mxb 165929 has a high conductivity ( and enhanced core cooling is suggested ) .",
    "we await specifically calculated cooling curves for mxb 165929 and further monitoring observations using _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ in order to be conclusive about the properties of the neutron star in this system .      for most quiescent neutron star x - ray transients",
    "it has been inferred that the thermal emission is in the range of a few times @xmath46 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "however , recently , indications have been found ( using _ xmm - newton _ data ) that the thermal emission from the accretion driven millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j1808.43658 in its quiescent state might be as low as a few times @xmath47 erg s@xmath2  ( campana et al . 2002 ; who suggested enhanced core cooling for this low thermal luminosity ) . although the statistics of those results were not overwhelming and have to be confirmed with additional observations , it is an interesting possibility and if the processes which produce the quiescent emission ( which has a power - law shape ; campana et al .",
    "2002 ) for this system would become inactive , sax j1808.43658 would become rather dim in quiescence .",
    "such weak quiescent neutron star systems might also be suggested by the indications found for enhanced cooling processes in certain systems , such as mxb 165929 .",
    "the possibility of dim quiescent neutron star systems raises the question of how dim certain neutron star systems can become ?    the answers to this question will have implications for our understanding of quiescent x - ray binaries .",
    "it has been found that those x - ray binaries which harbor a black hole instead of a neutron star can be at least one to two orders of magnitude less luminous in quiescence than the average neutron star system .",
    "this difference has been used as evidence that the black holes have event horizons ( e.g. , garcia et al . 2001 and references therein ) in contrast to the surfaces of neutron stars . however ,",
    "if certain neutron star systems might become similarly dim ( e.g. , due to enhanced core cooling or very dim outbursts ) , than this luminosity difference will disappear and with it the evidence for event horizons in black hole systems .",
    "the quiescent spectrum of sax j1808.43658 ( campana et al . 2002 ) indicates that the spectrum of such systems might not be dominated by a thermal component but might have a power - law shape , similar to what has seen for the black hole systems ( kong et al .",
    "2002 ) removing also the spectral differences .",
    "another area in which it might be important to determine the full range of the luminosity distribution of quiescent neutron star systems , is that of the study of the low - luminosity x - ray sources in globular clusters .",
    "based on their luminosities and their x - ray spectra ( when enough statistics are available ) , those sources which have luminosities above a few times @xmath48 erg s@xmath2 , have been classified as quiescent neutron star systems and those which have luminosities below @xmath48 erg s@xmath2 , as another type of object ( possible cataclysmic variables or millisecond radio pulsars ) . however , the observed low luminosity of @xmath49 erg s@xmath2   of sax j1808.43658 ( dotani , asai , & wijnands 2000 ; campana et al .",
    "2002 ) already shows ( irrespective of what exactly causes the x - rays in this source ) that those dim sources might be quiescent neutron star transients . the fact that the spectrum of sax j1808.43658 appears to be considerably harder ( campana et al .",
    "2002 ) than the average quiescent neutron star spectrum indicates that classifications on hardness ratio might lead to erroneous results .",
    "the possibility that the thermal emission of sax j1808.43658 might be very low even suggests that those sources which have luminosities down to only a few times @xmath47 erg s@xmath2  might also be quiescent neutron star systems .",
    "therefore , we conclude that classifying low - luminosity globular cluster sources based on their luminosity and broad band spectral shape ( i.e. , hardness ratio s ) might possibly lead to misleading results .",
    "the full extent of those errors depends on the full luminosity distribution of the quiescent neutron star transients and how the spectrum correlates with the luminosity .",
    "those properties have to be determined before a complete picture of the nature of the low - luminosity globular cluster sources can be understood .",
