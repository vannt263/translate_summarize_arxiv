    "fundamental physical observables of the gravitational field , such as energy and angular momentum , are notoriously hard to define satisfactorily . in asymptopia , where there exist the well - defined bondi @xcite and arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) @xcite masses , the quantities are non - local .",
    "the inherent non - locality is usually attributed to the equivalence principle ; one needs at least two observers to distinguish geodesic deviation from acceleration - dependent quantities .",
    "nevertheless , given the existence of the bondi and adm energy definitions on 2-surfaces at null and spatial infinities , it is reasonable to expect a degree of localization is possible .",
    "one possibility given by penrose @xcite is to associate quasilocal quantities to compact , oriented spatial 2-surfaces . given the difficulty in defining gravitational observables , it is perhaps not surprising that there exists a plethora of proposed quasilocal quantities ( @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "the definitions of quasilocal energy may be distinguished by the ability to satisfy various criteria .",
    "these include vanishing in flat space , taking reasonable values for spherically symmetric solutions , and approaching the adm and bondi values in appropriate limits .",
    "it is by no means simple to satisfy these criteria @xcite , @xcite .    with the complications involved in defining energy even in classical general relativity",
    ", it may seem perilous to define quantum quasilocal energy .",
    "however , in the context of the canonical ( @xmath0 ) theory there is a clear selection criteria for the correct physical quantity .",
    "when defined within a bounded region , functional differentiability of the constraints requires that , generically , surface terms must be added to make the theory well - defined .",
    "the surface term required by the hamiltonian constraint is the hamiltonian for the system on shell . in general , the method of functional differentiability generates boundary conditions on the phase space variables , gauge parameters , and surface terms ( as is explored in some depth in ref .",
    "@xcite for gravity and bf theory ) .",
    "originally , it was noticed that a surface term had to be added to the action so as to match the asymptotic expression .",
    "however , regge and teitelboim found that gravitational theory was simply inconsistent without this boundary term @xcite .",
    "the gravitational action has derivatives of the phase space functions , so the variation generates surface terms .",
    "it is only when these terms vanish ( or are canceled ) that the theory has a well - defined variational principle .",
    "the boundary hamiltonian or quasilocal energy is of this form ; it cancels a term arising in the variation of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this paper provides a quantization of the surface observable @xmath1 this reduces to the quasilocal energy of brown and york @xcite , to the adm energy in asymptopia , and to the misner - sharp mass in spherical symmetry ( @xcite ) .",

    "the classical expression used in that quantization was different than the one used here .",
    "in fact , the expression is only weakly equal to eq .",
    "( [ hclass ] ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting quantum operator is very similar and reduces to this adm expression under the same restrictions .",
    "a more extensive comparison between the operators is given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the present work completes the quantization of the boundary hamiltonian , even in a non - asymptotically flat context .",
    "the quantum definition is to satisfy modest criteria .",
    "i only ask that the operator be well - defined on the hilbert space induced from the full gauge invariant space .",
    "important criteria , including the proper behavior on semiclassical states and the appropriate algebra of boundary observables , is left for further investigation .",
    "definitions of simple semiclassical states or weaves @xcite are explored in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : spin - net gravity is briefly reviewed in section [ qg ] .",
    "this serves to base the definition of the quasilocal energy in the framework of the classical theory and provides an opportunity to fix notation and units .",
    "the main developments are contained in section [ qe ] where the operator is regularized in [ reg ] and given final form in [ recouplingnote ] .",
    "an alternate quantization is given in [ qevol ] and the full spectra of the resulting operators is presented in [ spectra ] .",
    "this paper concludes with a comparison with thiemann s @xmath2 operator and some discussion on wider implications of the quantum quasilocal energy operator .",

    "suppose that a system s bounding surface only intersected spin-@xmath238 edges of the underlying spin network .",
    "then , transitions due to adding or removing a spin-@xmath238 edge would result in radiation with the rather energetic fundamental frequency of @xmath239{3 } \\ , m / \\hbar$ ] .",
    "this mechanism is similar to the bekenstein - mukhanov quantization @xcite , in which the area is given by integer multiples of a fundamental area . in this case , however , the quasilocal energy is quantized in integer units , @xmath240 , so area scales as @xmath241 .",
    "of course , before we tune our radio receivers to listen to black holes , there is much more to understand . in particular , we need a characterization of semiclassical states and the dynamics . to see that this strongly affects the radiation ,",
    "we need only study the high spin limit @xcite .",
    "the energy gap narrows , as would be expected from the naive semiclassical limit .",
    "there are also some wider implications of the quasilocal energy .",
    "the number of directions is enormous and i confine my comments to four brief remarks : on a first glance at the quasilocal energy operator of eq .",
    "( [ qeadef0 ] ) it appears that the quasilocal energy operator depends on the orientation of the edges .",
    "since the kinematic state space of @xmath18 spin networks is independent of orientation this would be odd .",
    "in fact , the quasilocal energy operator does not depend on orientation of the edges .",
    "there are two aspects of this property .",
    "this is perhaps easiest to see by noting that when the orientation of an edge is changed , both the sign factor @xmath242 and the angular momentum operator @xmath140 change sign @xcite . in an abuse of notation the same @xmath140",
    "are used in the gauss operator @xmath243 , although the gauss operator is independent of edge orientation . on the other hand ,",
    "the operator definitely does depend on the orientation of the surface .",
    "when the orientation of the surface changes , only the geometric factor changes sign .",
    "orienting the edges to be outgoing from the vertices simply places the edges in three , simple categories : inside the region , outside the region , and tangent to the surface .",
    "one tantalizing aspect to this third category is the interpretation of edges which leave the region @xmath27 .",
    "they take energy with them .",
    "it remains to be seen whether these could provide structure for the 4-dimensional space ",
    "`` pillars of time '' in a 4-dimensional spin network model  or more exotic manifolds .    given the definition of the quasilocal energy operator and the induced hilbert space @xmath207 , the question arises whether the operator is consistent .",
    "if the spatial manifold @xmath5 is compact , is it true that @xmath244 vanishes ?",
    "the natural language in which to consider such questions is topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) @xcite , in which one studies diffeomorphism invariant theories on manifolds with boundary . while the manifolds are cut and sewn together , the theories associate maps to interiors and vector spaces to boundaries .",
    "a more careful study will be left to further work .",
    "but the question may addressed directly . on a particular spin network state ,",
    "say @xmath245 , the two operators act on the two `` halves '' of the state .",
    "one is based on @xmath246 ; the other is based on @xmath247 . as @xmath245 is a general",
    ", gauge invariant state , there are two types of vertices to consider , types ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "a short calculation shows that the contributions to the energies are numerically identical . to perform the sum . ]",
    "as this quasilocal energy is the boundary hamiltonian , one may describe the time development of the lorentzian theory on @xmath248 @xmath249 ( recall that the boundary conditions fix the lapse and metric on the boundary .",
    "a more complete treatment would also include terms with non - vanishing shift @xmath250 , giving rotations and boosts . )",
    "the energy operator is diagonal in the spin network basis , so the unitary evolution operator has a simple , well - defined form ( at least for type ( i ) vertices ) .",
    "it describes the system in terms of an observer on the surface @xmath29 .",
    "likewise , the quasilocal energy operator gives the partition function @xmath251 . as the quasilocal energy is the true hamiltonian ,",
    "this function is the partition function for the statistical mechanics of spin - net gravity .",
    "this observation is the starting point for a vast range of physical questions .",
    "for instance , is the energy quanta @xmath252 statistically favored ?",
    "what is the selection criteria for the ground state(s ) ?",
    "what is the entropy of a bounded system in spin - net gravity ?    what is particularly striking is the delightful number of physical questions that can be addressed with this operator in the current framework on spin - net gravity .",
    "this is but one result of the techniques which have been developed since 1995 and which offer methods for detailed study of these questions .",
    "in fact , it appears that these techniques are powerful and rich enough to bring us from theoretical modeling to physical predictions .",
    "i thank herbert balasin and robert depietri for discussions .",
    "thanks also to an anonymous reviewer for helpful , critical remarks .",
    "i gratefully acknowledge the support of the austrian science foundation ( fwf ) through a lise meitner fellowship .",
    "this appendix contains recoupling formulae needed in the calculations of the spectrum .",
    "the conventions are those of kauffman and lins @xcite ( for @xmath253 ) .",
    "short introductions and definitions of the basic recoupling quantities can be found in @xcite .",
    "the quantities needed in the calculation for the simplification of the quasilocal energy operator are : @xmath264 for instance , @xmath265 this is used in the recoupling calculation of eq .",
