    "particle detection with low - background liquid / gas xenon detectors offer world - leading sensitivity to hypothetical dark matter particle scattering events @xcite . in the absence of any convincing evidence for detection",
    ", the experimental challenge remains to increase detector sensitivity .",
    "this primarily means larger target masses and lower backgrounds .",
    "it also means maximizing the search capabilities of each particular detector .",
    "an example of this is the so - called `` s2-only '' or electron - only search technique @xcite .",
    "the technique is sensitive to single electrons , due to the fact that ionized electrons are extracted into the gas phase and amplified via proportional scintillation . with sensitivity set by the energy threshold of a single quanta ,",
    "liquid xenon targets are able to search for lower ( @xmath5  gev ) mass wimp dark matter candidates , as well as for dark sector candidates @xcite .    however , `` electron train '' backgrounds present a serious limitation to this technique . these consist of numerous single electron signals , typically of width @xmath6s , emitted over timescales @xmath7s .",
    "the time profile of this background is therefore sparse and long - lived compared with typical event durations , which are @xmath8s .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the origin of electron train backgrounds might lie in the thermalization and trapping of un - emitted electrons just below the liquid xenon surface , with eventual emission on significantly longer timescales .",
    "this possibility was previously hypothesized in ref .",
    "however , the hypothesis remains unconfirmed and the trapping lifetime is unknown . as a result , the dark matter search community sentiment appears to have concluded that liquid xenon will not be a competitive target for observing single or few electron signals from putative dark sector dark matter @xcite ( see in particular fig . 12 and",
    "13 , where a projection for xenon is omitted entirely ) .",
    "this sentiment was likely reinforced by a recent s2-only analysis @xcite , which stated that _",
    "`` a full background model ... can not be constructed , as the origin of the small - s2 background in the detector can not be reliably quantified ... '' _    the purpose of this article is to show that the thermalized , trapped electron hypothesis appears to be correct and that the background can in fact be quantified .",
    "we remind the reader that the standard search technique with this class of detector requires putative dark matter scattering events to result in both scintillation photon ( s1 ) and ionized electron ( s2 ) signals , separated by the time @xmath9 required for electrons to drift a distance @xmath10 across the liquid xenon target .",
    "the maximum drift time of an electron from the cathode to the liquid surface is @xmath11 . for post - event time",
    "windows @xmath12 , photoionization is the primary cause of single electrons @xcite .",
    "photoionization is easily vetoed in an s2-only analysis , because @xmath11 is typically a few hundred @xmath13s and so is directly connected to the originating event .",
    "in contrast , electron train backgrounds are observed to continue for time periods @xmath14 . in order to calculate the lifetime of trapped electrons ,",
    "it is necessary to know the barrier height imposed by the dielectric interface between the liquid and the gas phase xenon .",
    "this same barrier governs the emission of electrons which have been heated by the applied electric field .",
    "the first step is therefore to study the electron emission efficiency .",
    "ionized electrons in liquid xenon may be readily drifted by application of an electric field @xmath15 , with typical values @xmath16  kv / cm .",
    "such electrons are referred to as quasi - free due to being confined to the medium , and yet not localized to any particular atom . dual phase ( liquid / gas ) xenon detectors for dark matter search have a frisch grid a few mm below the liquid surface and an anode grid a few mm above it .",
    "a much larger electric field @xmath0 may then be applied across the phase boundary .",
    "typical ranges of the applied electric fields in the liquid are @xmath17  kv / cm . the electric field in the gas phase just above the liquid surface is approximately @xmath18 due to the relative dielectric constant of liquid xenon , @xmath19 @xcite . in this work , applied electric fields are assumed to have only a @xmath20 component .",
    "a temperature t=173  k was assumed for all calculations .",
    "typical operating temperatures tend to be within @xmath21  k of this value , and represent a rather small effect .",
    "the emission of quasi - free electrons across the liquid - gas boundary in pure xenon is a strong function of the applied electric field .",
    "only a single absolute measurement exists @xcite , which is reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : emission ] .",
    "several relative measurements ( see e.g. @xcite ) agree quite well with that work if they assume that at the highest measured values of @xmath0 , the efficiency for emission is unity .",
    "because of this extra assumption , relative measurements are not considered here .",

    "@xcite suggested a schottky barrier model for the electron emission efficiency , and their best fit is reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : emission ] .",
    "the agreement is not particularly satisfying , a point perhaps noted in the closing statement of that work : _ `` it appears that the mechanism of electron emission from liquid noble gases is more complicated ... ' ' _ .",
    "it is notable that both data and model from ref . @xcite",
    "suggest the possibility that the high-@xmath0 limit of the emission efficiency might not be unity .      as an electron approaches a dielectric boundary that is held at a constant potential , the force due to it s image charge results in an energy barrier .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as the schottky barrier , given by @xmath22 the force driving the electron toward the barrier is simply that due to the applied electric field , so @xmath23 .",
    "the combined potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] . for electrons in the condensed state , collisions tend to randomize an electron s velocity",

    "the energy distribution @xmath25 of electrons drifting under the influence of an electric field is less obvious .",
    "it may be derived from a solution of the boltzman equation , as explained in _",
    "`` theory of hot electrons in liquids , gases and solids . '' _",
    "one finds that on average , electrons retain thermal energies for electric fields below about 50  v / cm . by 5",
    "kv / cm , the average energy of electrons is a factor @xmath26 above thermal .    from these considerations , the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "define the electron emission efficiency as @xmath27 in which the factor @xmath28 serves to select electrons whose velocity has a component directed toward the barrier .",
    "equation [ eq : phib ] tends to infinity as the electron approaches the liquid / gas interface .",
    "physically , this is accommodated by the fact that the surface thickness is defined by atoms .",
    "if one assumes liquid xenon atoms to be arranged as a simple cubic lattice , the lattice constant can be calculated to be about @xmath29  m. inserting this into eq .",
    "[ eq : phib ] results in @xmath30  ev , which is the value quoted in ref . @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath3 was treated as a free parameter and was determined to have the value @xmath31  ev . the present work also treats @xmath3 as a free parameter .",
    "there are two problems with this basic model .",
    "the first concerns the mean free path , and the second concerns the number of attempts an electron makes before it succeeds in crossing the barrier .",
    "the n@xmath32 chance model begins with the same premises as the shottky barrier model . as a preamble ,",
    "it is critical to correct the values of the mean free paths which underpin the electron energy distribution @xmath25 .",
    "two mean free paths are defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite these were assumed to have the values @xmath33  m and @xmath34  m. however , calculations suggest @xmath35  m and @xmath36 is a function of @xmath0 @xcite . the field dependence given in ref @xcite",

    "this brings us to the second problem with the simple shottky barrier model : electrons scatter significantly as they travel through matter , their trajectory a random walk with a slight bias provided by the applied electric field .",
    "we must suppose that an electron which fails to cross the barrier on it s initial attempt will most likely continue to scatter .",
    "it may yet escape into the gas , or it may eventually thermalize just below the surface in the potential minimum shown in fig .",

    "@xmath55  kv / cm , the mean free path between collisions is @xmath56  nm and the saturated drift velocity is nearly 3000  m / s .",
    "this suggests a typical relaxation time @xmath57 between collisions of about 3  ps , and sets the timescale for emission in the @xmath58  chance model .",
    "suppose that a typical electron experiences up to 10 additional collisions between successive attempts to escape the liquid .",
    "the emission process would be complete in less than 1  ns , which is consistent with observation .",

    "[ fig : etrain ] predicts a lifetime of trapped electrons in the range @xmath65  ms .",
    "the prediction appears to be compatible with the original observations of xenon10 .",
    "there is some uncertainty about the correct relaxation time for this calculation : trapped electrons are in a region where the @xmath20 component of the electric field reverses direction .",
    "it seems possible that the relaxation time for trapped electrons could be larger by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "this would directly increase the calculated lifetime for emission .",

    "this suggests that electron train backgrounds may be emitted many cm from the @xmath71 vertex of the originating event .",
    "it must be noted that this simple model has ignored the inevitable complications that might be encountered in a real detector , such as surface roughness ( waves ) , a radial component to the electric field @xmath0 , a periodic potential due to the electrode wires or meshes , and fluid flow , evaporation and condensation . further investigation by experimental groups is essential , and would ideally compare a measured thermal emission lifetime against this model .",
    "such measurement appears to require low - background conditions .",

    "there is significant interest in suppressing the electron train background , as it is an impediment to searches for low - mass wimp dark matter or dark sector dark matter candidates .",
    "the calculated lifetime is very long and suggests that this background is inherent to the operation of liquid / gas xenon detectors .",
    "however , there may be several ways to suppress the background .",
    "the first possibility is of course to increase the emission probability @xmath72 .",
    "the model suggests @xmath73 at a field @xmath74  kv / cm .",
    "this value is only slightly larger than the operating fields of previous and existing experiments , but may be challenging to achieve .",
    "however , it would immediately offer a factor of about @xmath75 suppression .",
    "a more elaborate suppression of the background could in principle be implemented with fast ( @xmath76s ) high voltage switching @xcite , such that immediately after registering the s2 signal from an event , trapped electrons from that event would be directed back to the electrode located a few mm below the liquid surface .",
    "alternatively , it may be possible to stimulate the emission of the electrons using led photons .",
    "for example , commercially available 940  nm leds would provide a typical energy of 1.3  ev per photon , more than enough to help trapped electrons surmount @xmath3 .",
    "the photocathode sensitivity of the photomultipliers used for detection of xenon scintillation light typically decrease by over three orders of magnitude by 700 nm .",
    "likely , they would be blind to these photons .",
    "a final comment is that should all hardware mitigation efforts fail , it should still be possible to mitigate electron train backgrounds in off - line analysis . by looking at tens of ms windows following large @xmath77  mev events , the time structure ( @xmath78 ) of single electron emission",
    "could be measured .",
    "then , an @xmath71 map of the variation in @xmath78 could be constructed .",
    "such a map would likely be necessitated by experimental complications , an incomplete list of which can be found at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : et ] .",
    "finally , a background expectation could be placed on all inter - event quiet periods in the detector , regardless of the size of the preceding event .",
    "this could significantly increase the sensitivity of future searches for low mass or dark sector dark matter candidates .",
    "liquid xenon detectors deployed for particle physics experiments have a track record of operating at cathode voltages which are significantly lower than their design goal .",
    "the operating voltage in some cases has been limited by the onset of unexplained , voltage - dependent scintillation .",
    "this scintillation can quickly overwhelm any potential signal , and thus operation of the detector .",
    "could it be that the effect originates from electrons drifting in very small regions of very high electric field ?",
    "what follows is a calculation of this possibility .      the behavior of eq .",
    "[ eq : tails ] is plotted in fig .",
