    "* ) . in these systems",
    "the ion pressure anisotropy is expected to play a key role in the large scale dynamics of the plasma .",
    "for instance , @xcite pointed out that pressure anisotropies can give rise to an anisotropic stress that can contribute to angular momentum transport and plasma heating in low - luminosity accretion disks .",
    "this physics is not included in standard mhd models of accretion disks .",
    "velocity space instabilities limit the growth of the pressure anisotropy and give rise to small scale fluctuations in the magnetic field .",
    "these fluctuations can , in turn , affect the large scale transport properties of the plasma by modifying the mean free path of particles .",
    "magnetic field amplification in a collisionless system generically drives @xmath12 .",
    "there are two ion - scale instabilities that can be excited in this regime : the mirror and the ion - cyclotron ( ic ) instabilities @xcite .",
    "the mirror instability consists of non - propagating , strongly compressional modes .",
    "their fastest growing wave vectors @xmath13 are oblique to @xmath7 , with the magnetic variations parallel to @xmath7 being much larger than the perpendicular fluctuations , @xmath14 . for a bi - maxwellian distribution of ions , and",
    "assuming cold electrons , the threshold condition for mirror instability growth is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the ion temperature perpendicular ( parallel ) to @xmath7 , and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the ic instability , on the other hand , consists of transverse electromagnetic waves , with the fastest growing @xmath13 being preferentially parallel to @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "whether the ic or mirror instability sets in first depends on how fast these instabilities grow for a given set of plasma conditions .",
    "@xcite showed that for @xmath19 , the growth rate of the ic instability is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the cyclotron frequency of the ions .",
    "in addition , for @xmath22 , the threshold anisotropy depends very weakly on @xmath23 .    in the linear regime",
    ", the dominant instability will be determined by which threshold is reached first as @xmath7 is amplified .",
    "these estimates for the threshold conditions imply that , in the linear regime , the ic instability should dominate for @xmath24 , while the mirror instability should dominate for @xmath25 .",
    "although both the mirror and ic instabilities have been extensively studied in the linear regime , a complete theory of their nonlinear evolution and saturation is still lacking . in this paper , we are particularly interested in the question of how the mirror and ic modes behave after the initial phase of exponential growth .",
    "indeed , in most astrophysical scenarios where the magnetic field is amplified , the growth of the field occurs on time scales much longer than the growth time of the relevant kinetic instabilities .",
    "therefore , most of the evolution of the velocity space instabilities happens in a nonlinear regime , where the conditions typically assumed in linear studies , such as a homogeneous plasma or a bi - maxwellian distribution of particle velocities , are not necessarily satisfied .",
    "moreover , if the field is amplified by order unity or more , a quasi - linear analysis is not applicable .",
    "one of the key questions we are interested in addressing in this case is whether the mirror instability saturates via pitch - angle scattering that violates magnetic moment conservation @xcite or via a nearly @xmath4-conserving rearrangement of the magnetic field , with fluctuations @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we shall see that both of these saturation processes can in fact be important .",
    "the nonlinear regime of the ic and mirror instabilities has been studied both theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and numerically @xcite . in most numerical studies , however , the pressure anisotropy is treated as an initial condition , which decreases as the instabilities grow and saturate .",
    "thus , in these approaches the nonlinear saturation can not be followed for a time much longer than that of the initial exponential growth .",
    "moreover , many of the previous numerical studies have focused on one - dimensional simulations .    in this paper",
    "we study the long term , nonlinear evolution of the mirror and ic instabilities using two - dimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations in driven systems . in order to self",
    "- consistently explore a time much longer than the initial exponential growth , we continuously induce the growth of @xmath27 by amplifying the mean field @xmath28 during the simulation .",
    "we concentrate on amplification by incompressible plasma motions .",
    "thus , our simulations impose a shear velocity on the plasma , which sustains the growth of the magnetic field and maintains an overall positive pressure anisotropy .",
    "this growth is intended to mimic magnetic field fluctuations in a turbulent plasma and mhd - scale instabilities that amplify the magnetic field , like the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ? * ) or convective instabilities driven by anisotropic thermal conduction in dilute plasmas @xcite .",
    "we suspect that our results are also relevant to cases in which perpendicular heating or parallel cooling drives a plasma mirror and/or ic unstable , as in , e.g. , the solar wind .",
    "@xcite conducted an analogous study to ours using hybrid simulations . in their study , expansion of the simulation box decreased the mean magnetic field , so that on average @xmath29 .",
    "this in turn led to the growth and nonlinear saturation of the firehose instability .",
    "also , @xcite conducted a similar hybrid simulation study where the simulation box is expanded along the directions parallel and perpendicular to @xmath7 . with this setup , @xmath10 becomes larger than @xmath11 on average , and both the mirror and ic instabilities can grow and reach saturation .",
    "our work is complementary to these hybrid simulation studies and focuses on the process in which the condition @xmath12 is achieved by field amplification due to shearing plasmas .",
    "we also consider higher values of @xmath30 @xmath31 , relevant to accretion disks , the icm , and the near - earth solar wind .",

    "this is because we assume that the pressure anisotropy is generated on a timescale long compared to the ion cyclotron timescale , which is probably not true at collisionless shocks .",

    "[ sec : results ] shows our results and  [ sec : conclu ] presents our conclusions . throughout the paper",
    "we compare some of our simulation results with linear theory predictions appropriate to our pic simulations .",
    "these have artificially low ion to electron mass ratios ( @xmath32 . the linear theory results are based on the linear vlasov solver developed in @xcite .    during the completion of this work ,",
    "@xcite presented calculations of firehose and mirror saturation in shearing plasmas with very similar results to those that we present here .",
    "we use the electromagnetic , relativistic pic code tristan - mp @xcite in two dimensions .",
    "the simulation box consists of a square box in the @xmath33 plane , containing plasma with a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath34 initially pointing along the @xmath35 axis .",
    "since we want to simulate a magnetic field that is being amplified in an incompressible way , we impose a shear motion of the plasma so that the mean particle velocity is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a shear parameter with units of frequency and @xmath38 is the distance along @xmath35 . from flux conservation ,",
    "the @xmath39-component of the mean field evolves as @xmath40 , implying a net growth of @xmath41 .",
    "although we present simulations resolving the @xmath33 plane only , we also tried runs where the @xmath42 plane was resolved . in those cases the isotropization efficiency was substantially lower",
    "this is because , if the @xmath42 plane is resolved , the growing component of @xmath7 is perpendicular to the plane of the simulation . this way the angle between the relevant wave vectors , @xmath13 , and @xmath7 can not be 0 .",
    "this over - constrains the wave vectors that are allowed to exist , artificially reducing the isotropization efficiency .",
    "an important physical parameter in our simulations will be the ratio of the initial ion cyclotron frequency to the shear frequency , @xmath43 .",

    "in particular , solar wind measurements at @xmath256 show that @xmath257 is limited by the linear threshold of the mirror instability ( instead of the ic instability .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observations of @xcite also show enhanced magnetic fluctuations and magnetic compressibility that follow the linear mirror threshold fairly well .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that the observations presented by @xcite and @xcite showing dominance of the mirror instability also include the regime @xmath258 , which is not considered in our study .",
    "also , the dominance of the mirror instability could be affected by properties of the solar wind that are usually not included in calculations of instability thresholds .",
    "these include the presence of @xmath259 of alpha particles ( see , e.g. , figure 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the drift of alpha particles with respect to protons @xcite , and the frequent presence of a proton beam @xcite .",
    "we interpret the dominance of the mirror modes in our simulations as being due to the suppression of the ic waves , which is caused by the ion velocity distribution function departing from bi - maxwellian @xcite .",
    "this interpretation also requires the ic modes to have finite amplitudes ( although smaller than the one of the mirror modes ) so that they can maintain , via pitch - angle scattering , an ion distribution function that is marginally stable to the growth of ic waves . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", these ic modes have not been found by in - situ heliospheric measurements during mirror dominated events .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in our simulations the mirror and ic modes only have comparable amplitudes during the initial , exponential regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta6]@xmath93 and @xmath94 ) . in the saturated regime ( which is likely to be more representative of the observed state of the plasma in the heliospheric and astrophysical systems ) , we find that the mirror modes have significantly larger amplitudes",
    ". moreover , this dominance increases with the magnetization @xmath43 , as can be seen by comparing figures [ fig : beta6]@xmath93 and @xmath94 . can be accounted for by the fact that the scattering rate of cyclotron - frequency fluctuations is expected to be @xmath187 . if we equate this to the shear parameter @xmath37 ( which is , roughly , the rate at which pitch - angle scattering takes place , as can be seen from the changing rate of @xmath116 in fig .",
    "[ fig : muderivs ] ) , one obtains that @xmath260 . ]",
    "thus , for realistic values of @xmath43 , we do not anticipate easily detectable ic waves by in - situ measurements in cases where the mirror modes dominate .",
    "the departure from the bi - maxwellian ion distribution function has not been confirmed by in - situ heliospheric measurements of mirror - dominated events either .",
    "we believe that this is due to the high sensitivity of resonant instabilities to gradients in the velocity distribution function .",
    "thus , in cases where ic and mirror modes can have similar growth rates , only small deviations from the bi - maxwellian distribution can significantly reduce the importance of the ic modes and give way to the dominance of the mirror modes .",
    "we , therefore , do not anticipate easily detectable departures from bi - maxwellian associated to this effect . nevertheless , future careful observations comparing the nature of the fluctuations and the ion distribution functions in the solar wind can help to unveil these effects .",
    "a second application of our results is to low - collisionality accretion flows onto black holes . in these systems pressure anisotropies",
    "can produce an anisotropic stress that can increase the transport of angular momentum and the heating of the plasma @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with @xcite s hypothesis that the mirror and/or ic instabilities would provide enhanced pitch angle scattering and regulate the evolution of the plasma pressure tensor .",
    "axisymmetric kinetic simulations have also demonstrated this directly @xcite though the restriction to axisymmetry limits the quantitative applicability of these initial simulations to real disks .",
    "one of the key conclusions of our study in this paper is that even modest plasma magnetization is sufficient to quantitatively capture the nonlinear saturation of the mirror instability .",
    "for example , our @xmath261 results in figures [ fig : beta20b2s ] & [ fig : mubeta20 ] show that the evolution of the ion pressure anisotropy , ion magnetic moment , and turbulent fluctuations are quite similar for @xmath114 and @xmath149 .",
    "the primary difference is that in the lower magnetization run the plasma has a larger `` overshoot '' of the saturation pressure anisotropy set by the linear mirror instability threshold .",
    "this weak dependence on magnetization is encouraging because it is computationally infeasible to reach @xmath149 in three - dimensional kinetic simulations of astrophysical plasmas ( e.g. , accretion disks ) .",
    "one of the interesting questions not fully addressed by our work is the saturation of velocity space instabilities in turbulent low - collisionality plasmas where the shear rate of the mean magnetic field itself fluctuates in time and the magnitude of the large - scale turbulent fluctuations satisfies @xmath262 .",
    "our calculations in this paper have focused on the case where an imposed velocity shear amplifies a background magnetic field by order unity or more . if , on the other hand , the shear acts for less time such that the background field is amplified by significantly less , the plasma may never become mirror / ic unstable ( depending on @xmath30 and @xmath221 ) or the background shear may reverse sign before the mirror / ic fluctuations have reached sufficiently large amplitudes for pitch angle scattering to set in .",
    "this regime will be explored in future work .",
    "another key question not addressed by our study is isotropization of the electron pressure anisotropy . in future work",
    "we will study how fast electrons interact with the large - scale mirrors generated by the ion pressure anisotropy , and whether there are separate electron - scale fluctuations that produce significant electron pitch - angle scattering ( e.g. , the whistler instability ) .",

    "previous 1d studies of the mirror instability suggest that its growth and saturation are dominated by the  resonant \" scattering of @xmath218 particles ( where @xmath264 is the particle velocity component parallel to the magnetic field ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to a flattening of the distribution function near @xmath218 .",
    "in contrast , our 2d runs discussed in the main text show that scattering by mirror modes is fairly momentum independent , with no significant flattening of @xmath265 . to compare our results more directly to the previous literature , in this appendix we compare the mirror saturation in 1d and 2d for different values of @xmath154 , paying especial attention to the behavior of @xmath218 particles .",

    "to best compare with the previous literature , we use initial - value simulations in this appendix , where a linearly unstable pressure anisotropy is imposed as an initial condition .",
    "figure [ fig:1d2d2.3 ] compares simulations with @xmath266 , @xmath267 , @xmath268 in 1d and 2d . in the 1d simulation , the initial magnetic field @xmath34 forms an angle of @xmath269 with the resolved dimension of the simulation . apart from the different number of dimensions",

    "this difference in the scattering efficiency can be explained considering the modes that grow in the 1d and 2d simulations .",
    "indeed , in the 1d case , mirror modes with wave vectors pointing in only one direction can grow . in the 2d case ,",
    "on the other hand , both ic and mirror modes appear ( with the mirror modes forming both positive and negative angles with respect to @xmath34 ) .",

    ", we can see flattening of @xmath265 for @xmath218 .",
    "this flattening is consistent with the results of @xcite , who argue that it is due to the resonant interaction of @xmath218 particles with the mirror modes .",
    "the 2d run , however , does not have this flattening , implying that the saturation process in two dimensions is quite different .",
    "this is indeed expected from the dominant role of the ic instability .        since at higher @xmath272 the ic instability",
    "is expected to play a subdominant role , we also explored the case where initially @xmath273 .",

    "these two quantities differ significantly , implying an important correlation between @xmath123 and @xmath163 .",
    "this correlation almost disappears in the 2d case , which shows the presence of more efficient pitch - angle scattering in the 2d case .",
    "since for @xmath273 the ic instability plays a subdominant role , this is likely a property of the mirror instability itself rather than the presence of the ic instability as was the case for the lower @xmath154 results shown in figure [ fig:1d2d2.3 ] . the higher rate of scattering in 2d also affects the maximum amplitude of the fluctuations , which are shown in panels [ fig:1d2d20]@xmath50 and [ fig:1d2d20]@xmath101 for the 1d and 2d cases .",
    "although in both cases @xmath276 ( implying that mirror dominates ) , in 2d the amplitude of the modes is smaller , which means that field rearrangement plays a less important role in the approach to marginal stability .    finally , figure [ fig:1d2d20 ] also compares @xmath265 at the saturated state ( @xmath277 ) in the 1d and 2d cases .",
    "there is very little flattening for @xmath218 in both cases .",
    "this confirms our result from the main text that the pitch - angle scattering in the mirror dominated case is fairly independent of particle momentum .",
    "it is interesting , however , that we do not see flattening even in 1d . since @xcite reported the appearance of flattening only near the threshold of the mirror instability ( and only for certain box sizes ) , we tested simulations with the same plasma parameters having anisotropies as low as @xmath278 and found similar results ."
