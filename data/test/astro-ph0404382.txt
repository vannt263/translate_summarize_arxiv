    "it is well known that clusters are strong x - ray emitters whose study can put constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters .",
    "there are different methods to trace the evolution of the cluster number density : a ) the x - ray temperature function ( xtf ) has been presented for local ( e.g. henry & arnaud 1991 ) and distant clusters ( eke et al .",

    "the reasons leading to the quoted discrepancies has been studied in several papers ( eke et al . 1998 ; borgani et al .",
    "2001 ) ( 1 ) the inadequate approximation given by the ps ( e.g. , bryan & norman 1997 ) .",

    "these reasons lead me to re - calculate the constraints on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , using the xlf and xtf .",
    "similarly to reichart et al . ( 1999 ) , i re - derived an expression for the xlf , using an improved version of the mass function and m - t relation , obtained in del popolo 2000a , del popolo 2000b , respectively , taking account of the effects of asphericity and tidal interaction with neighbors .",
    "then i got some constraints to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , by using the _ rosat _ bcs and emss samples .",

    "this last is the one obtained in del popolo ( 2000a ) , and is based on the merging - halo formalism of lacey & cole ( 1993 ) , accounting for the fact that massive clusters accrete matter quasi - continuously , and again take account of angular momentum acquisition by protostructures : @xmath9 } { \\left [ \\frac{1}{m_1}+\\left ( \\frac{t_\\omega } { t_{0}}\\right ) ^{\\frac 23 }   + \\frac{k_0(m_1,x)}{m_{0}^{8/3 } } \\right ] } \\label{eq : ktt1}\\ ] ] ( see del popolo 2000a for a derivation of the previous equation and the definition of the terms in it ) .",

    "the lesson from the previous calculation is that taking account of non - sphericity in collapse and the fact that massive clusters accrete matter quasi - continuously gives rise to a noteworthy change in the prediction of cosmological parameters , as @xmath0 . in order to check the previous trend ,",

    "as previously reported , the mass function ( mf ) is a critical ingredient in putting strong constraints on cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) . in the following",

    ", we can fit the data described in section . 2 of henry ( 2000 ) to the theory previously described using the quoted maximum likelihood method .",
    "the most general description of the results requires the three parameters of the fit ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 and n ) .",
