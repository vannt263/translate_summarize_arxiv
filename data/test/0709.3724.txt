    "nanoparticle arrays@xcite are a perfect system to analyze correlated electronic transport and have received a lot of experimental and theoretical attention during the last decade@xcite . in spite of this , their properties and i - v characteristics are not well understood .",
    "the presence of disorder in these arrays complicates the analysis@xcite .",
    "the two most relevant and experimentally unavoidable types of disorder are charging disorder due to random charges quenched at the substrate and resistance disorder due to small changes in the distance between the nanoparticles and the exponential dependence of the resistance on the distance .",
    "voids in the lattice or a non - homogeneous distribution of nanoparticle size can be also present@xcite but this source of disorder is less important in some recent experiments .",
    "theoretical analysis have mainly considered arrays in which each nanoparticle is capacitively coupled only to its nearest neighbors@xcite , especially the case in which this coupling is small .",
    "the truncation of capacitive coupling to nearest neighbor results in an interaction between charges in different conductors which decays exponentially with the distance between them@xcite .",
    "this limit is relevant for those arrays coupled to a gate electrode@xcite , as the mobile charges in this lead effectively screen coulomb interactions .",
    "a complete description of the non - equilibrium transport through arrays has been presented only very recently@xcite and is restricted to one - dimensional metallic nanoparticle arrays in which interactions are finite only when charges are placed on the same conductor .",
    "self - assembled arrays fabricated nowadays are deposited onto insulating substrates and generally lack a gate voltage . in these arrays , the screening of long - range interactions is less effective , but the proximity of other conductors , both islands and leads , modifies its value compared to a @xmath0 coulomb law@xcite .",
    "the electrodes contribute to the screening of the interaction .",
    "theoretical analysis including the effect of long - range interactions are scarce and limited@xcite to numerical results or particular cases . in this paper",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the effect of the long - range character of the interaction on the transport properties through ordered and disordered one - dimensional arrays .",
    "we consider the influence of charging and resistance disorder .",
    "the interactions are described by an inverse capacitance matrix , in which coupling to other conductors is not truncated .",
    "the matrix is calculated including the effect of screening and the current is computed numerically .",
    "some analytical approximations are also discussed and compared with the numerical results .",
    "this comparison allows us to understand the origin of the behavior found . to analyze the transport we put forward a model to describe the electrostatic interactions among the charges occupying the islands and the electrodes , which allows for a clear description of the relevant contributions to the transport .",
    "in particular , we introduce the concept of polarization potential drop at the junctions between the nanoparticles . as in our previous study of the short - range case@xcite",
    ", we analyze the threshold voltage , flow of current and voltage drop for the cases with and without charge or junction resistance disorder .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii describes the system under study and the model used to analyze the transport properties and compares it with previous models used in the literature . in section iii",
    "we discuss the correlations introduced by the long - range character of the interaction in the disorder potential .",
    "section iv , v and vi respectively analyze the threshold voltage , i - v characteristics and voltage drop through the array . in section vii",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "finally , in appendix i we describe the two methods employed to calculate the screened interaction between charges , and in appendix ii we discuss the effect of screening on the distance - dependence of this interaction .",
    "we consider an array composed of @xmath1 metallic spheres of radius @xmath2 and center to center distance @xmath3 . throughout lengths",
    "are measured in units of @xmath2 and energies in units of the charging energy of an isolated nanoparticle @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the nanoparticle capacitance when it is isolated . here and in the following the electronic charge @xmath6 .",
    "as @xmath7 decreases , the charges in an island feel more the effects of charges in other islands . in this sense",
    "we say that decreasing the spacing @xmath7 increases the range of interactions .",
    "experimentally arrays in which the metallic nanoparticles are capped with thiols have @xmath8 .",
    "arrays self - assembled via other types of molecules , like dna , allow for the investigation of larger @xmath7 values .",
    "we model each nanoparticle with a continuum level spectrum .",
    "the tunneling barriers which separate them have a resistance much larger than the quantum of resistance and we treat the transport at the sequential tunneling level@xcite . to analyze the transport the array",
    "is sandwiched between two large electrodes .",
    "we assume that the electrodes are not ideal voltage sources , but have finite self - capacitances .",
    "the potential on the leads will thus fluctuate in response to all tunneling events , even those that do not directly involve the electrodes . for a more extensive discussion of these assumptions see@xcite    the energy of the system",
    "is given by @xmath9 labels @xmath10 and @xmath11 refer to source and drain electrodes and @xmath12 to the islands .",
    "latin capital and lower case letters are used to denote electrodes and islands respectively .",
    "greek indexes will be used when the labels refer to both islands and electrodes .",
    "@xmath13 is a random potential at each island , present in charge disordered arrays , and zero in the clean case .",
    "charges @xmath14 and @xmath15 maintain source and drain electrodes at potentials @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the electrostatic interactions in our system are defined through an inverse capacitance matrix @xmath18 that directly includes all the conductors in our system .",
    "all the elements @xmath19 are positive .",
    "the inverse capacitance matrix is symmetric , @xmath20 , and has dimension @xmath21 , i.e. it includes the electrodes .",
    "we have developed two numerical methods to calculate the interaction potential ( inverse capacitance matrix ) of an array of spheres .",
    "these methods are explained in appendix i. the properties of this interaction , how it compares to previous calculations for the case of cubic , cylindrical ( with array and island axis collinear ) and disk shaped islands ( with array and island axis perpendicular ) and the screening effect of the electrodes are discussed in appendix ii . for simplicity we have considered two large spherical leads .",
    "the coupling between the islands and the electrodes is included through @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the current is computed numerically by means of a monte carlo simulation , described in@xcite .",
    "it is controlled by the probability of a tunneling process , given by @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the resistance of the junction through which tunneling takes place and @xmath26 is the difference between the energy of the system before and after the tunneling event . in the following",
    "we restrict the discussion to zero temperature .",
    "then @xmath27 .",
    "it is finite only when @xmath26 is negative .    after a bit of algebra ,",
    "the change in energy due to a tunneling event from @xmath28 to @xmath29 can be rewritten as @xmath30 here , the excitonic energy @xmath31 necessary to create an electron - hole pair in an uncharged array is given by @xmath32 the second term in ( [ change ] ) can be seen as the potential difference between the sites involved in the tunneling . at the electrodes @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the bias potential and we have introduced the bias asymmetry parameter @xmath28 as in ref.@xcite .",
    "both @xmath36 , also denoted as symmetric bias , and @xmath37 have been used in the literature .",
    "@xmath28 characterizes how the bias voltage is partitioned between source and drain chemical potential shifts .",
    "since no physical properties depend on the overall zero of energy , varying @xmath28 in our model is entirely equivalent to rigidly shifting all impurity potentials by @xmath38 . since in our model",
    "all transport occurs by transfer between adjacent nanoparticles , the evolution of a nanoparticle array as the bias voltage is applied is sensitive to @xmath28 , and we believe that the dependence on @xmath28 could in principle be observable , see discussion in @xcite .    at the islands",
    "the potential can be decomposed into three terms @xmath39 , the disorder potential @xmath13 due to random charges in the substrate , the polarization potential @xmath40 at the island induced by the electrodes at finite bias and the potential due to the charges in the nanoparticles @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 with @xmath43 { \\ ; \\mbox{.}}\\label{lambda2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 the charging potential @xmath45 with @xmath46 { \\ ; \\mbox{.}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath47 can be interpreted as a modification of the interaction between the charges in the islands due to the proximity of the electrodes at a fixed potential . for the case @xmath48 in which both charges are on the same island this modification was already discussed in@xcite , as the interaction of a soliton with a passive edge .",
    "expression ( [ ctilde ] ) shows that not only when the charges are in the same island , but also when they occupy different islands , their effective interactions are modified by the presence of the voltage - biased leads .",
    "two types of terms can be differentiated in the modification of this interaction .",
    "the last two terms in ( [ ctilde ] ) or direct terms , can be viewed as the interaction between a charge in island @xmath49 and the image charge at one of the electrodes induced by the charge in island @xmath50 .",
    "this term is affected by the presence of the other electrode . on the other hand ,",
    "the terms containing @xmath51 , or indirect terms , reflect the interaction between the image charges in both electrodes .",
    "direct and indirect terms have opposite sign .",
    "the direct term reduces the effective interaction ; the indirect one increases it .",
    "we emphasize that ( [ change ] ) to ( [ ctilde ] ) follow from ( [ freecharge ] ) after straightforward and trivial algebra .",
    "we have just defined a few quantities and split the change in energy @xmath26 and potential @xmath52 in several terms to facilitate the physical interpretation of the transport properties .",
    "we can also define the potential drop at each junction @xmath53 with the corresponding disorder , polarization and charging terms @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "label @xmath49 for a junction runs from @xmath57 to @xmath11 and refers to the one between conductors @xmath58 and @xmath49 .",
    "the polarization potential drop at each junction , @xmath59 does not depend on the resistance of the junctions , but on the electrostatic interactions of each island with the voltage - biased leads . here",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 .    a linear drop of the polarization potential implies @xmath62 , requires @xmath63 for all junctions and independence on @xmath28 .",
    "from ( [ lambda2 ] ) we see that a priori @xmath64 depends both on the geometry of the electrodes and the array and on how this is biased .",
    "it depends on how the charges in the islands and the electrodes interact . for most capacitance matrices , in particular for the capacitance matrices discussed here , the polarization potential is not linear in the island label @xmath49 and the potential drops are larger close to the biasing leads . in the onsite case , discussed in ref.@xcite @xmath65",
    "is finite only at junctions @xmath57 and @xmath11 and given by @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "in general , as the range of the interactions between charges increases , @xmath68 is more homogeneous    in previous models@xcite @xmath18 had dimension @xmath69 and the inverse self - capacitances of the electrodes , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and the inverse mutual capacitances between them , @xmath72 , were neglected . in our model @xmath73",
    "are small quantities whose values will not significatively affect the quantitative results .",
    "these other models do not include the indirect term in ( [ ctilde ] ) either . on the other hand , an expression analogous to ( [ phipol ] )",
    "can be defined in other models .",
    "for example , in the model previously discussed by middleton and wingreen@xcite , with an @xmath69 capacitance matrix , the interaction between an island and an electrode is given by the interaction of the charge of the island with charges induced by the electrode in the islands immediately adjacent to the electrode .",
    "this interaction results in a polarization potential characterized by @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the capacitance between the source or drain electrode and an adjacent island . in this model , except in the extreme long - range case ,",
    "see below , the polarization potential does not decay linearly with distance and depends on the asymmetry of the bias potential .",
    "other models , however , impose a uniform polarization drop through the array @xcite    as discussed in@xcite and section vi , even if the polarization potential does not drop linearly and is independent on the junction resistance , the average total potential drop depends on the resistance ( via the average charge occupation of the islands ) and for homogeneous resistances a linear drop is partially recovered at large bias voltages .    whenever not specified we assume that all the junction resistances @xmath76 are equal and given by @xmath77 .",
    "the effect of non homogeneous resistances will be studied in two ways . in the first case ,",
    "one of the junction resistances at a given position is larger than the other ones ( given by @xmath77 ) . in the second case the value of the resistances , varying in between two values",
    "is randomly assigned to the junctions . to mimic",
    "that disorder in resistances originates in variations in distances between the islands and the exponential dependence of the junction resistance in the distance between islands the junction resistance is given by @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 input parameters and @xmath81 .",
    "here @xmath82 is a random number between @xmath10 and @xmath57 . in the paper ,",
    "we have used @xmath83 and @xmath84 . with these values",
    "the resistance changes respectively between ( 5 - 11)@xmath77 , ( 8 - 21)@xmath77 and ( 23 - 83)@xmath77 .",
    "charged impurities trapped in the substrate underlying the nanoparticle array create random potentials at the nanoparticles . in molecularly assembled arrays , charge transfer to the organic molecules surrounding the nanoparticles results in non - integer random charges at the islands@xcite . charging disorder is included in our model through a random potential at each island @xmath85 . in principle , @xmath85 take values larger than the charging energy @xmath86 . however , for large values of the disorder potential , charges flow to compensate for these large fluctuations . in this section",
    "we analyze the effect of the long - range interaction on the final distribution of disorder potential as compared to the case with onsite interactions .",
    "we find that the distribution of probabilities @xmath87 and @xmath88 are modified .",
    "the maximum and minimum values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 are modified compared to the short range case and given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "correlations between the disorder potentials of neighboring islands are introduced .",
    "if interactions between the charges are short - range , ( @xmath93 ) , the set of disorder potentials @xmath94 , once the screening of the potential due to the mobile charges is taken into account , is uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath95 .",
    "the probability associated with each pair , @xmath96 , is a constant , see fig .  1 and the distribution of the probabilities of the potential drops due to disorder across the array junctions , @xmath97 , has the form@xcite @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in the presence of long - range interactions , the charges which flow to compensate the large fluctuations of the disorder potential , influence the value of the total potential at neighboring islands .",
    "as a consequence , the screened disorder is correlated@xcite .",
    "the probability of each pair @xmath96 is no longer a constant .",
    "@xmath88 depends on the inverse capacitance matrix @xmath18 . in order to analyze these correlations and obtain the proper disorder potential distribution we assign the potentials by first randomly assigning potentials to the islands @xmath100 , in the interval @xmath101 with @xmath102 larger than the charging energy .",
    "we then find the equilibrium configuration of charges @xmath103 that occupy the array with island disorder potentials @xmath104 and grounded leads ( @xmath105 ) and redefine the potentials at each site using the expression @xmath106 the effect of the screening charges @xmath103 is included in the redefined potentials @xmath94 so we then reset the number of charges at each site to zero to avoid doublecounting the charge when we calculate the total electrostatic energy of our system .    following the redefinition of the disorder potentials , we find that on average the distribution of the disorder potentials @xmath94 and the disorder potential drops @xmath107 between adjacent islands are independent of @xmath102 .",
    "the values of @xmath94 and @xmath107 are bound by @xmath91 and @xmath108 respectively , as the total energy of the system is at a global minimum when the original disorder configuration @xmath104 is screened out by the charges @xmath103 .",

    "the energy of adding an additional charge to an island from a large electrode outside the system with neglible self inverse capacitance is given by @xmath109 where the top ( bottom ) sign refers to the change in energy of the system as a result of adding a positive ( negative ) charge to island @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath110 when the array is in equilibrium , the disorder potential values must lie between @xmath111 .",
    "the magnitude of this quantity equals @xmath86 in the onsite limit and decreases as the strength and range of the coulomb interactions increases , see appendix ii .",

    "we have not been able to fit our results with ( [ fit ] ) .",
    "we recover the bump found by likharev and matsuoka@xcite , but it is smaller than the one they observe , even when our particles are very close .",
    "we believe that the differences are due to the different geometry of the system under study .    from the decomposition of the induced screening charge in high - order multipoles discussed in previous appendix it is possible to get some insight on how does the bump appear .",
    "the correction to the inverse capacitance @xmath330 due to screening is @xmath331 , see ( [ correction ] ) , which has the same sign as the monopole - induced multipole interaction .",
    "thus , @xmath332 has the same sign as the interaction of the monopolar charge in @xmath28 with the multipolar charge induced in all conductors by the monopolar charge in @xmath29 .",
    "let us restrict to dipolar order , which will be the largest contribution .",
    "@xmath333 generates dipolar charges in all the other conductors @xmath80 , equal to @xmath334 and the monopolar charge in @xmath28 interact with these induced charges via @xmath335 .",
    "both the monopolar - dipolar interaction @xmath336 and the dipolar induced charges are odd quantities with respect to position . to dipolar order ,",
    "all the elements of @xmath337 are positive .",
    "the sign of the two odd quantities will control the sign of @xmath332 .",
    "consider @xmath332 , with @xmath338 , the charges induced by a monopolar charge placed in @xmath29 in conductors from @xmath57 to @xmath339 and from @xmath340 to @xmath341 have the same sign , but the interaction of a monopolar charge in @xmath28 with them , have opposite .",
    "thus those terms coming from the charge induced in conductors from @xmath57 to @xmath339 and those from conductors @xmath342 to @xmath343 contribute to @xmath344 with different sign .",
    "the sign of the contribution of the conductors at the right of @xmath29 will be the same as those at the left of @xmath28 and both induced charge and interaction have opposite sign . as further are these conductors to @xmath28 and @xmath29 the correction will be smaller .",
    "individual contributions from each conductor @xmath80 will be larger when @xmath345 . the contribution of the interaction term which comes from the dipoles generated in conductors between @xmath28 and @xmath29 increase @xmath202 .",
    "only when the contribution of the terms which decrease the inverse capacitance matrix element is able to compensate the contribution of those ones which increase it , the total change will be negative . as closer are @xmath28 and @xmath29 the number of terms increasing the interaction will decrease .",
    "@xmath202 is expected to be smaller than the bare value , only if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are very close , what results in the appearance of the bump and the anti - screening effect at intermediate and large distances .",
    "the interaction obtained differs considerably from the one resulting from capacitive coupling only to nearest - neighbors .",
    "this form of the interaction has been used frequently in the literature , and applies when the system is coupled to a gate electrode which screens the long - range part .",
    "the capacitance matrix has a triband form .",
    "only @xmath346 and @xmath347 are finite .",
    "the inverse of @xmath348 for the case of an infinite array becomes @xmath349 with @xmath350 and @xmath351 defined from @xmath352 .",
    "due to the exponential dependence @xmath350 can be viewed as the decay length of the interaction , which increases with @xmath353 .",
    "interactions on the same island are given by @xmath354 . in the case of a finite array of length @xmath1 this value",
    "is approached , from below , as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the onsite case is recovered when @xmath355 and long - range interactions appear in the opposite limit @xmath356 . in the later limit the interaction potential goes like @xmath357 it decays linearly with distance .",
    "the energy to create an electron - hole pair @xmath358 remains bound and equal to @xmath359 . on the contrary ,",
    "the diagonal element @xmath360 diverges with the array size .",
    "there is not such unphysical divergence in @xmath131 with the array size in our model .    to analyze the transport properties the array",
    "is sandwiched between two electrodes , much larger than each of the nanoparticles . to this end",
    "we consider a one - dimensional array of @xmath1 nanoparticles placed in between two large spheres , with radius @xmath25 , which play the role of the leads .",
    "the large size ensures large screening and that @xmath361 and @xmath362 are much smaller than the islands @xmath131 .",
    "the spherical shape greatly simplifies the calculations of the inverse capacitance matrix .",
    "the interaction between the charges at the islands and those at the electrodes and the inverse capacitance elements of the electrodes determine @xmath176 and @xmath363 , which control the polarization voltage drop through the array and to a large extent the current flow at small voltages , see figs .",
    "6(a ) and ( b ) .    for the size of the electrodes used in the text , @xmath364 , the inverse capacitance of the islands close to the electrodes",
    "is slightly reduced compared to those at the center , except for very small @xmath7 . for small @xmath7 the inverse capacitance of islands at the center of the array",
    "is almost insensitive to the presence of the electrodes .",
    "if the electrodes are much larger the dependence of the inverse capacitance matrix elements with the size of the electrodes can become non - monotonous .",
    "this behavior , like the one found for small @xmath7 is most probably associated to the spherical shape chosen to model the electrodes .",

    "<S> we analyze the effect of the long - range interaction on the transport properties through ordered and disordered one - dimensional metallic nanoparticle arrays . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the threshold voltage , the i - v curves and the voltage drop through the array are modified as compared to the case in which interactions are restricted to charges placed on the same island . </S>",
    "<S> we show that some of these modifications are due to finite interactions between charges in different nanoparticles while other ones are due to interactions between charges in the islands and those at the electrodes , what produces a polarization potential drop through the array . </S>",
    "<S> we study the screening of the disorder potential due to charged impurities trapped in the substrate and find that long - range interactions introduce correlations between the disorder potentials of neighboring islands . </S>"
