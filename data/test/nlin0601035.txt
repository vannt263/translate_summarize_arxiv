    "one of the most important problems of nonlinear models analysis is the construction of their partial solutions . nowadays",
    "this problem is widely discussed . we know",
    "that the inverse scattering transform @xcite and the hirota method @xcite are very useful in looking for the solutions of exactly solvable nonlinear equations , while most of the nonlinear differential equations describing various processes in physics , biology , economics and other fields of science do not belong to the class of exactly solvable equations .",
    "certain substitutions containing special functions are usually used for determination of partial solutions of not integrable equations .",
    "the most famous algorithms are the following : the singular manifold method @xcite , the weierstrass function method @xcite , the tanh ",
    "function method @xcite , the jacobian elliptic function method @xcite , the trigonometric function method @xcite .",
    "lately it was made an attempt to generalize most of these methods and as a result the simplest equation method appeared @xcite .",
    "two ideas lay in the basis of this method .",
    "the first one was to use an equation of lesser order with known general solution for finding exact solutions .",
    "the second one was to take into account possible movable singularities of the original equation .",
    "virtually both ideas existed though not evidently in some methods suggested earlier .",
    "however the method introduced in @xcite has one essential disadvantage concerning with an indeterminacy of the simplest equation choice .",
    "this disadvantage considerably decreases the effectiveness of the method . in this paper",
    "we present a new method for finding exact solutions of nonlinear differential equations , which greatly expands the method @xcite and which is free from disadvantage mentioned above . when working out our method we used the ideas of power geometry recently developed in @xcite .",
    "with a help of the power geometry we show that the search of the simplest equation becomes illustrative and effective .",
    "also it is important to mention that the results obtained are sufficiently general and can be applied not only to finding exact solutions but also to constructing transformations for nonlinear differential equations .",
    "the paper outline is as follows .",
    "new method for finding exact solution of nonlinear differential equation is introduced in section 2 .",
    "the application of our approach to the generalized korteveg ",
    "de vries  burgers equation is presented in sections 3 .",
    "solitary waves of the generalized kuramoto  sivashinsky equation and of the nonlinear fifth  order evolution equation are found in sections 4 and 5 , accordingly .",
    "let us assume that we look for exact solutions of the following nonlinear n - order ode @xmath1 in power geometry any differential equation is regarded as a sum of ordinary and differential monomials .",
    "every monomial can be associated with a point on the plane according to the following rules @xmath2 here @xmath3 are arbitrary constants . when monomials are multiplied their coordinates",
    "are added .",
    "the set of points corresponding to all monomials of a differential equation forms its carrier . having connected the points of the carrier into the convex figure we obtain a convex polygon called a polygon of a differential equation .",
    "thus the nonlinear ode is associated with a polygon @xmath4 on the plane .",
    "now let us assume that a solution @xmath5 of the basic equation can be expressed through solutions @xmath6 of another equation .",
    "the latter equation is called the simplest equation .",
    "equations having known general solutions or solutions without movable critical points are usually taken as the simplest equations .",
    "consequently we have a relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 the main problem is to find the simplest equation .",
    "substitution into the basic equation yields transformed differential equation which is characterized by new polygon @xmath8 .",
    "the suitable simplest equations should be looked for among the equations whose polygons , first , are of lesser or equal area than @xmath8 and , second , have all or certain part of edges parallel to those of @xmath8 .",
    "let us suppose that we have found such polygon @xmath9 .",
    "then we can write out the simplest equation @xmath10 it is important to mention that the choice of the simplest equation is not unique .",
    "if the following relation @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is a differential operator ) is true then it means that for any solution @xmath6 of the simplest equation there exists a solution of .    in this paper",
    "we will consider a case of identity substitution , i.e. @xmath13    then we should study the polygon @xmath4 of the equation and try to find the polygon @xmath9 generated by the simplest equation . in this case , our method can be subdivided into four steps .    _",
    "the first step . _ construction of the polygon @xmath4 , which corresponds to the equation studied .",
    "_ the second step . _ construction of the polygon @xmath9 which characterizes the simplest equation .",
    "this polygon should posses qualities discussed above .    _",
    "the third step . _ selection of the simplest equation with unknown parameters in such a way that it generates the polygon @xmath9 .    _ the fourth step .",
    "_ determination of the unknown parameters in the simplest equation .    to demonstrate our method application",
    "let us find exact solutions of nonlinear differential equations belonging to the following class @xmath14    this class of nonlinear ordinary differential equations containes a number of differential equations that corresponds to the famous nonlinear evolution equations .",
    "they are the burgers ",
    "huxsley equation , the korteveg  de vries  burgers equation , the kuramoto ",
    "sivashinsky equation and so on .",
    "the following points @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are assigned to the monomials of the equations .",
    "the polygon @xmath4 corresponding to the equations is the triangle presented at figure 1 ( ( a ) : @xmath21 and ( b ) : @xmath22 ) .",
    "examining the triangle @xmath4 we can easily find the polygon @xmath9 assigned to the simplest equation of the first order ( see smaller triangles at figure 1 ) .",
    "hence the simplest equation can be written as @xmath23 this equation can be transformed to a linear equation .",
    "its general solution takes the form @xmath24    later , having found the simplest equation , we should determine the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 for members of the class",
    ". then exact solutions of these equations will be expressed through the general solution of the simplest equation .",
    "let us find exact solutions of the generalized korteveg ",
    "de vries  burgers equation with a help of our method .",
    "this equation can be written as    @xmath27    at @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the famous korteveg  de vries equation .",
    "cauchy problem for this equation is solved by the inverse scattering transform @xcite .",
    "soliton solutions of this equation were found using the hirota method @xcite . at @xmath28 and @xmath30 a dissipation is taken into account . in this case , the equation is not integrable one .",
    "its special solutions were obtained in the work @xcite .",
    "later these solutions were rediscovered many times .    using the travelling wave reduction @xmath31 and integrating with respect to @xmath32",
    ", we get @xmath33 where the constant of integration is equated to zero .    taking into account the results obtained in section 2 ,",
    "we can write the simplest equation in the form @xmath34    the general solution of the equation is @xmath35    let us formulate our results in the form of the following theorem .",
