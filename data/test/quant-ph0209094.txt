    "the no - cloning theorem is one of the most important characters of quantum information , which is different from classical information . on the basis of superposition principle , wootters and",
    "zurek@xcite pointed out that it is impossible to find a way to copy an arbitrary unknown state perfectly .",
    "they introduced a cloner which is named wootters - zurek copying machine ( w - z cm ) .",
    "this machine can copy orthogonal state perfectly , but copy the superposition states badly .",
    "since determinately perfect copying is impossible , the approximate cloning is necessary .",
    "buek and hillery@xcite have first shown that the universal cloner is possible and introduced a copying machine which is called buek - hillery copying machine ( b - h cm ) .",
    "this machine is deterministic and does not need any information about the state to be cloned .",
    "it can copy every state equally well .",
    "then it has been proved@xcite that the b - h cm is the optimal cloning machine for universal cloning , that is , this machine attains the largest local fidelity .",
    "there is another kind of cloner which is named state - dependent cloner .",
    "it needs some information about the cloning state .",
    "there are three types of this kind of cloner : deterministic , probabilistic and hybrid cloners .",
    "probabilistic cloner has been introduced by duan and guo@xcite .",
    "they found the states could be cloned perfectly with some probability less than 1,when the states are linearly independent .",
    "the deterministic state - dependent cloner was first investigated by bru  _ et al._@xcite and it was solved completely when the state - set contains only two states which have equally _ a priori _ probability",
    ". then chefles and barnett@xcite generalized this problem to the two states which have different _ a priori _ probability and the global fidelity is used to measure of the cloning process instead of the local fidelity .",
    "they gave the optimal strategy to make the global fidelity maximal and found this fidelity is larger than the universal cloner .",
    "several months latter , chefles and barnett@xcite hybridized the former two types of cloners to get the hybridized cloner .",
    "so the former two cloners can be viewed as a special case of it .    when the state - set contains only two states , there is a analytic solution of the optimal strategy .",
    "when the number of the states is more than two , there is no analytic solution for this problem . before the exact solution of 2-state - dependent quantum cloner was found , some scientists had already began to study the bound of these processes .",
    "the original work was proposed by hillery and buek@xcite , they derived a lower bound for the amount of the noise introduced by quantum cloning process .",
    "more recently , rastegin@xcite gave another lower bound for the noise by a new method .",
    "since solving this problem exactly is impossible when state - set contains more than two states , it is necessary to find the bound of the global fidelity of the quantum cloning process . by the way ,",
    "when the number of the states is increasing , these states are no longer linearly independent .",
    "so the duan - guo cloning machine does not work .",
    "even though the bound can not tell us what we can do , it can only tell us what we can not attain . in this paper ,",
    "some bounds on the multi - state - dependent quantum cloning process are given .",
    "we study the three - state - dependent ( that is , the state - set contains three states ) quantum copying more carefully and generalize the method to the multi - state - dependent cloning process . in section ii , some necessary lemmas are introduced . in section iii",
    ", the upper bound of the global fidelity of 3-state - dependent quantum cloning process is given . in section iv ,",

    "this process is a symmetric cloning , which can be denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the optimal process means the global fidelity is maximal .",
    "the global fidelity is defined as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the actual @xmath9 copies of cloned state of @xmath10 , @xmath11 denotes the exact @xmath9 copies of cloned state of @xmath12 which is a n - fold tensor and @xmath13 stands for the _ a priori _ probability of the state @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denotes the @xmath16 blank copies .",
