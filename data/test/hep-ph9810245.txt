    "the concept of chiral symmetry breaking in strong interactions goes back to the pioneering work by nambu @xcite , and it has been widely explored and discussed since that time .",
    "restoration of chiral symmetry at high densities was proposed by lee and wick @xcite already in 1974 .",
    "theoretical procedures for studying chiral symmetry restoration at high temperatures were proposed on the same year by dolan and jackiw @xcite and by weinberg @xcite .",
    "qcd at finite temperature and density has attracted much interest .",
    "for latest studies of the qcd phase diagram see for instance @xcite .",
    "physical applications are to high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite and to the physics of the early universe @xcite .",
    "a review of lattice calculations can be found for instance in ref .",
    "the nambu - jona - lasinio model has been used under different approximations to obtain indications on the chiral transition ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "a number of peculiar features may emerge due to the chiral phase transition and recently much attention has been attracted by the possibility of disoriented chiral condensate formation ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it is strongly suspected that a single transition occurs rather than separate transitions for deconfinement and chiral - symmetry .",
    "we had suggested a heuristic argument indicating that , at least for zero density , the critical temperature for chiral transition , @xmath3 , coincides with that for deconfinement , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the order parameters usually considered cover extreme and opposite ranges .",
    "the thermally averaged polyakov loop is suitable in the limit of infinite quark masses to describe the transition from the confined to the non - confined phase .",
    "the other extreme is the limit of vanishing quark masses , where the thermally averaged quark - antiquark bilinears are the typical order parameters for chiral symmetry transition .",
    "we shall deal here with the chiral transition , concentrating on the thermally averaged quark bilinears at finite temperatures as order parameters for chirality . for light massive quarks , such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "rigorously , chiral symmetry is already broken in the lagrangian , but we can still retain the notion of phase transition , by looking at the region of @xmath7 where the condensate has a rapid variation . the current quark mass plays a role analogous to that of an external magnetic field in the ferromagnetic transition , as it explicitly violates the chiral symmetry whose restoration characterizes the phase transition",
    ".    the analysis will be based on a composite operator formalism at finite temperature .",
    "the formalism makes use of an effective action for composite operators @xcite .",
    "actually the effective potential admits of a landau expansion around the critical point and thus the behaviour of the condensate is well reconstructed by knowing the coefficients ( which are infrared safe ) and the critical exponents .",
    "we shall compare with the results following from a landau expansion and show the general agreement .    within the composite operator formalism",
    "we had already discussed the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath8 @xcite , in the whole range of temperatures up to @xmath3 .",
    "we shall here mainly deal with the ratio of the scalar to pseudoscalar mass @xmath9 at varying temperature .",
    "this ratio has a peculiar theoretical interest as a sensible indicator of the degree of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "let us for the moment neglect the small @xmath5 and @xmath6 quark masses .",
    "when chiral symmetry is restored the two mesons are degenerate in mass .",
    "the ratio is then equal to unity . at zero temperature instead in the broken chiral phase",
    "the pion is a goldstone and has vanishing mass , while the sigma has a finite mass from the chiral condensation .",
    "thus one expects the mass ratio to decrease from @xmath10 to one at the chiral transition .",
    "quark masses will change this picture quantitatively leading to a decrease from a finite value to a value close to one .",
    "beyond some temperature , before approaching the critical value for the transition , the sigma will not have phase space left to decay into two pions .",
    "its instability will decrease when increasing the temperature , and the channel into two pions will finally be suppressed at some temperature in the vicinity but lower than the critical temperature .",
    "the decay channel into two photons will still be available and become the dominant channel @xcite .",
    "it is too early to say whether a possible experimental signature for the transition may be inferred from such behaviour .",
    "an accurate determination of the mass ratio versus temperature is in itself of theoretical interest as it constitutes a significant parameter for the degree of chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature .",
    "this we shall do in this note in the composite operator formalism by making use of parameter values obtained from fits to zero temperature qcd .",
    "in section 2 we shall summarize the main results of the application of the composite operator formalism in qcd . in section 3",
    "we determine the relevant qcd parameters and discuss the hadronic masses at non zero temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the observables is discussed in section 4 , where we also calculate the temperature at which the sigma can no longer decay via strong interaction .",

    ", one has to derive the explicit expressions for the masses and for the decay constants of the pseudoscalar octet mesons which are the pseudo - goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "these expressions constitute a system of coupled equations which we have solved by an approximation method .",
    "the experimental inputs are the decay constant and mass of the charged pion , the charged kaon mass and the electromagnetic mass difference between the neutral and the charged kaon .",
    "the outputs of the numerical fit for the octet meson masses ( agreement within 3% ) are the masses of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath70 quarks and the mass parameter @xmath46 .",
    "the values we get are the following @xcite @xmath95 finally , the parameter @xmath59 , which appears in the expression ( [ coupling ] ) for the running coupling constant , has to be determined on phenomenological grounds . if we compare our model in the low-@xmath7 regime with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite we find @xmath96 for @xmath40 flavours , which gives @xmath97 for @xmath41 @xcite .    with these values for the relevant parameters it is easy to determine the masses of the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons at @xmath61 ( we are using the value @xmath98 for the pion decay constant ) @xmath99 and ( again at @xmath61 ) the fermionic condensates at @xmath46 for massless and massive quarks @xmath100 the value we have obtained for the mass of the scalar meson , @xmath101 , accords very well with those obtained by other authors within different approaches to the study of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in qcd @xcite .",
    "it is well known that as the temperature @xmath7 increases we expect some changes in the hadronic properties of matter as a consequence of a possible phase transition .",
    "for instance , a physical quantity as @xmath8 will decrease as @xmath7 increases @xcite .",
    "this means that the pion tends to decouple from matter ( quarks and leptons ) as @xmath7 increases .",
    "as far as the pion mass is concerned , @xmath103 has a weak dependence on the temperature .",
    "in fact the value of @xmath103 is dominated by the current quark mass for temperatures below the critical value , whereas it becomes independent of @xmath51 at the critical temperature or above it .",
    "this should be expected because , for @xmath104 , the pion becomes an ordinary resonance and its mass is dominated by @xmath47 and not by @xmath51 .",
    "this is a clear sign that the pion loses its goldstone nature once the approximate chiral symmetry is restored @xcite .",
    "the scalar meson mass @xmath105 will decrease in association with partial chiral symmetry restoration in hot matter .",
    "in fact the scalar @xmath68 meson can be described as a @xmath106 quasi bound state and its mass is about twice the constituent quark mass @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath68-mass will decrease substantially with increasing temperature and this behaviour is mainly determined by the @xmath7-dependence of the constituent quark mass .",
    "the decreasing of the @xmath68-mass is expected from the restoration of chiral symmetry at @xmath107 .",
    "in fact @xmath108 for @xmath109 at @xmath107 . as a consequence @xmath105 will become smaller than @xmath110 at some temperature @xmath111 and the @xmath68-meson , which has a large width at @xmath61 due to the decay @xmath112 , would appear as a sharp resonance at high temperature since the amplitude for @xmath112 would vanish above @xmath0 ( near the critical point of the chiral phase transition ) . thus one can expect to have a better chance of seeing the @xmath68-meson emerge as a clear , narrow state at non zero temperature .",
    "in fact , since for @xmath113 the decay width of @xmath68 by strong interaction vanishes , only the electromagnetic width coming from @xmath114 is left @xcite .    within our model",
