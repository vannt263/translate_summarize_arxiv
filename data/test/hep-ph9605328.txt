    "there has been a great deal of recent theoretical interest in heavy quark mesons , that is , mesons containing charm quarks or bottom quarks such as @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the basis of this interest is heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , which hinges on the realisation that in the limit of infinite quark mass extra symmetries , and hence degeneracies , occur beyond those normally associated with qcd @xcite .",
    "it is a property of many existing hqet analyses , particularly of meson spectrum calculations , that dynamical self dressing of the quarks is either not included at all , or rarely included in a non - perturbative fashion .",
    "examples of recent spectrum calculations in which heavy quarks are modelled essentially by free propagators are given in ref .",
    "however , one could argue that a theory which does not prevent quarks from being on mass shell is not in keeping with the spirit of a confinement and may lead , in certain instances , to incorrect results . in bethe - salpeter equation calculations for instance",
    ", there is in principle nothing to prevent the occurrence of spurious production thresholds .    at the other end of the meson spectrum , namely the physics of light quarks , the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) technique",
    "@xcite has enjoyed considerable success in modelling a number of light meson phenomena .",
    "basic to the dse technique is the quark propagator .",
    "the spacelike structure of this propagator has been well modelled within the dse technique for light quarks . at a phenomenological level ,",
    "model quark propagators based on numerical studies of approximate dyson schwinger equations have proved efficacious in calculating light meson spectra @xcite , electromagnetic form factors of the pion and kaon @xcite , @xmath2-@xmath2 scattering lengths @xcite , quark loop contributions to @xmath3-@xmath4 mixing @xcite and the anomalous @xmath5 and @xmath6 form factors @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to formulate an extension of the dse technique to the realm of heavy quarks . in the applications of the the dse technique to light quarks listed above",
    ", it has not been necessary to determine the behaviour of quark propagators well away from the real spacelike @xmath7-axis .",
    "however , for the purpose of accurately modelling confined heavy quarks , because the self energy is small compared with the current quark mass @xmath8 , it is particularly important to know the analytic structure of the heavy quark propagator near the ( timelike ) bare fermion mass pole @xmath9 .",
    "the method frequently used within the dse technique of fitting analytic functions to the numerically determined spacelike quark propagator is inadequate for this task .",
    "it is for this reason that new ideas must be developed within the dse technique if it is to be adapted to heavy quarks .",
    "it is the philosophy of the dse technique that confinement in qcd should be signalled by the absence of timelike poles in the quark propagator .",
    "this analytic structure is the result of non - perturbative quark self dressing , which in principle could be demonstrated by a full treatment of the quark dyson - schwinger equation .",
    "many numerical calculations of approximate quark dyson - schwinger equations in confining field theories have demonstrated propagator solutions which are free of timelike poles @xcite , though not necessarily free of complex conjugate poles away from the real @xmath7-axis @xcite .",
    "herein we shall examine in detail the analytic structure of the heavy quark propagator in the limit of infinite quark mass .",
    "we shall also consider the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) for bound states of heavy quarks and light antiquarks .",
    "our eventual aim is to make contact with the observed spectrum of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "however , at the present level of approximation we are unable to find solutions to our model bse because of spurious poles in the model quark propagators .",
    "we suggest ways in which the model can be improved to overcome this problem .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section ii we develop the basic formalism for the heavy quark propagator . in section iii",
    "we consider the bethe - salpeter equation for mesons consisting of one heavy and one light antiquark .",
    "sections iv and v deal with scalar and vector mesons respectively , and demonstrate that the symmetries of hqet are preserved within the heavy quark limit of the dse technique .",
    "some numerical results are given in section vi and conclusions drawn in section vii .",
    "before understanding the procedures which must be employed to ensure the extension of the dse technique to heavy quarks , it is important to appreciate that a naive translation of the light quark sector dse technique , by setting the quark mass to large values in the existing formalism and computer codes , simply will not work .",
    "this is because the interesting physical phenomena are driven by non - perturbative contributions to the heavy quark propagator in the vicinity of the bare fermion mass pole .",
    "these contributions are of order @xmath10 compared with the bare fermion propagator .",
    "earlier studies of the heavy fermion limit of another confining theory , qed3 @xcite , demonstrate categorically that for fermions whose mass is greater than the typical scale of the interaction of the theory , this information can not be accurately obtained by an extrapolation of the spacelike solution of the fermion propagator produced by the usual dse technique , and a new formalism must be developed .",
    "we begin with the general form for the inverse of the dressed quark propagator consistent with lorentz and cpt covariance : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath1 are scalar functions .",
    "we use a euclidean metric in which timelike 4-vectors satisfy @xmath13 . within the dse technique the full quark dyson - schwinger equation is typically truncated to a manageable approximation . for the purposes of illustrating the extension to the heavy quark sector , we consider the simplest viable approximation to the quark dse , @xmath14 in which the quark ",
    "gluon vertex has been replaced by a bare vertex , and the dressed gluon propagator is modelled by a representation @xmath15 in a feynman - like gauge .",
    "our formalism for calculating model heavy quark propagators can be extended without trouble to include more realistic vertex anstze ( to allow for gauge covariance @xcite ) and to more realistic model gluon propagators ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in the limit of heavy quark masses , @xmath16 ,",
    "the dressed quark propagator is dominated by the bare form @xmath17 .",
    "however it is important to isolate from the full propagator order @xmath10 corrections to the bare propagator which drive confining and remnant chiral symmetry breaking effects . to this end",

    "solution of the bse is numerically demanding , and the choice of model gluon propagator employed herein is primarily designed to reduce the numerical integration from three to two dimensions .",
    "we therefore use as input a particularly simple model gluon propagator , namely a gaussian propagator in a feynman - like gauge .",
    "because we are working in the chiral limit of the light quark , all dimensionful parameters can be scaled by the the width of the gaussian function , and the model is defined by a single adjustable parameter .",
    "we find the analytic structure of the heavy quark meson is consistent with that required for the change of integration variable used in the dse .",
    "however we can not unambiguously say whether the dse leads to a confined heavy quark .",
    "our bare vertex approximation to the dse yields a succession of masslike poles which move off the timelike axis one by one as the parameter in the model gluon propagator is varied .",
    "as we point out below , we believe that these poles are a spurious artifact of the approximations employed .    the combination of bare vertex and gaussian gluon propagator leads to poles in both the light and heavy quark propagators in the timelike half of the complex momentum plane over the broad range of input parameters studied .",
    "while poles off the real timelike momentum axis do not in principle spoil quark confinement , they can prevent successful solution of the bse , which samples the quark propagators throughout a region of the complex plane . for",
    "the simple model set out above this is indeed the case .",
    "we have demonstrated numerically that the poles generated by the bare vertex approximation restrict the meson mass @xmath199 to values of @xmath61 which do not include any bound state solutions .    in order to proceed further",
    "it will be necessary to develop an improved model which is not plagued by spurious singularities . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is demonstrated that if the bare quark gluon vertex is replaced by a vertex ansatz satisfying the ward - takashi identity , such as the ball - chiu vertex @xcite , the quark propagator becomes an entire function .",
    "this result holds independently of the current quark mass , and so must also hold in the heavy quark limit .    ideally one would like to incorporate quark propagator which is an entire function into our heavy quark formalism in a way consistent with successful dse technique studies of light quark mesons . of particular importance to the light meson sector is the requirement that the model should produce a goldstone pion in the chiral limit .",
    "this is achieved by ensuring that the choice of bethe - salpeter kernel is compatible with the choice of quark - gluon vertex in the dse @xcite .",
    "while there is no practical way at present to achieve such a compatibility with the ball - chiu vertex , good results can be achieved for the light pseudoscalar and vector meson octets by inverting a bare vertex approximation dse from an entire light quark propagator to construct a separable approximation to the bethe - salpeter kernel @xcite .",
    "extension of the separable approximation in a similar manner to the heavy quark sector , beginning with the light quark propagators employed in ref .",
    "@xcite and a heavy quark propagator obtained from the ball - chiu vertex is perhaps the most promising way to proceed at this point .",
    "one potentially then has a single non - perturbative model of meson dynamics applicable to the entire range of meson masses .    finally we note that , if the dse technique is taken as a serious description of hadronic phenomena , we are led unavoidably to a treatment generically of the kind set out in this paper .",
    "the above analysis illustrates for the first time the importance of the analytic structure of heavy quark propagators and its significance in determining the heavy meson spectrum .",
    "our analysis leads to a heavy quark self energy which will contribute as significantly to the dynamics of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons as that of the light quarks , and therefore can not be ignored .",
    "furthermore we are unaware of any existing treatment of the heavy quark self energy which is genuinely non - perturbative and has the potential to provide a qualitative explanation of heavy quark confinement . for these reasons",
    "we believe it is important to persevere with the application of the dse technique to the heavy quark sector .",
