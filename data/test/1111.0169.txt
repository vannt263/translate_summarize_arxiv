    "the signatures of the strong interactions in the quark - gluon matter were found in heavy ion collisions experiments  @xcite .",
    "there are proposals  @xcite suggesting that color - magnetic monopoles contribution can explain this rather unexpected property .",
    "these proposals inspired a number of publications devoted to the properties and possible roles of the monopoles in the quark - gluon phase  @xcite .",
    "lattice gauge theory suggests a direct way to study fluctuations contributing to the euclidean space functional integral , in particular , the color - magnetic monopoles can be studied . in a number of papers",
    "the evidence was found that the nonperturbative properties of the nonabelian gauge theories such as confinement , deconfining transition , chiral symmetry breaking , etc .",
    "are closely related to the abelian monopoles defined in the maximally abelian gauge @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this was called a monopole dominance  @xcite .",
    "the drawback of this approach to the monopole studies is that the definition is based on the choice of abelian gauge .",
    "there are various arguments supporting the statement that the abelian monopoles found in the mag are important physical fluctuations surviving the cutoff removal : scaling of the monopole density at @xmath4 according to dimension @xmath5 for infrared @xmath6 cluster  @xcite ; abelian and monopole dominance for a number of infrared physics observables ( string tension  @xcite , chiral condensate  @xcite , hadron spectrum     @xcite ) ; monopoles in the mag are correlated with gauge invariant objects - instantons and calorons  @xcite .",
    "it has been recently argued that the mag is a proper abelian gauge to find gauge invariant monopoles since thooft - polyakov monopoles can be identified in this gauge by the abelian flux , but this is not possible in other abelian gauges  @xcite .",
    "most of these results were obtained for @xmath0 gluodynamics but then confirmed for @xmath7 theory and qcd  @xcite .",
    "listed above properties of abelian monopoles survive the continuum limit and removal of the gribov copy effects .",
    "it is worth noticing that removal of gribov copy effects changes numerical values of monopole characteristics quite substantially  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are studying thermal monopoles .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that thermal monopoles in minkowski space are associated with euclidean monopole trajectories wrapped around the temperature direction of the euclidean volume .",
    "so the density of the monopoles in the minkowski space is given by the average of the absolute value of the monopole wrapping number .",
    "in  @xcite another approach to study thermal monopole properties in the quark - gluon plasma phase based on the molecular dynamics algorithm was suggested and implemented .",
    "the results for parameters of inter - monopole interaction were found in agreement with lattice results  @xcite .",
    "first numerical investigations of the wrapping monopole trajectories were performed in @xmath0 yang - mills theory at high temperatures in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "a more systematic study of the thermal monopoles was performed in ref .",
    "it was found in  @xcite that the density of monopoles is independent of the lattice spacing , as it should be for a physical quantity . the density  density spatial correlation functions were computed in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that there is a repulsive ( attractive ) interaction for a monopole ",
    "monopole ( monopole  antimonopole ) pairs , which at large distances might be described by a screened coulomb potential with a screening length of the order of @xmath8 fm . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed to associate the respective coupling constant with a magnetic coupling @xmath9 . in the paper",
    "@xcite trajectories which wrap more than one time around the time direction were investigated .",
    "it was shown that these trajectories contribute significantly to a total monopole density at @xmath10 slightly above @xmath1 .",
    "it was also demonstrated that bose condensation of thermal monopoles , indicated by vanishing of the monopole chemical potential , happens at temperature very close to @xmath1 . however , the relaxation algorithm applied in  @xcite to fix the mag is a source of the systematic errors due to effects of gribov copies .",
    "it is known since long ago that these effects are strong in the mag and results for gauge noninvariant observables can be substantially corrupted by inadequate gauge fixing  @xcite . for the density of magnetic currents at zero temperature",
    "it might be as high as @xmath11 .",
    "for nonzero temperature the effects of gribov copies were not investigated until recently . in a recent paper  @xcite this gap was partially closed .",
    "it was shown that indeed gauge fixing with sa algorithm and @xmath12 gauge copies per configuration gives rise to the density of the thermal monopoles @xmath13 to @xmath14 lower ( depending on the temperature ) than values found in  @xcite .",
    "large systematic effects due to effects of gribov copies found in ref .",
    "@xcite imply that results obtained in earlier papers  @xcite for the density and other monopole properties can not be considered as quantitatively precise and need further independent verification .",
    "the quantitatively precise determination of such parameters as monopole density , monopole coupling and others is necessary , in particular , to verify the conjecture  @xcite that the magnetic monopoles are weakly interacting ( in comparison with electrically charged fluctuations ) just above transition but become strongly interacting at high temperatures . in this paper",
    "we use the same gauge fixing procedure as in refs .",
    "@xcite to avoid systematic effects due to gribov copies .",
    "the careful study of the finite volume and finite lattice spacing effects was made in @xcite .",
    "we fix our spatial lattice size to @xmath15 which was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be large enough to avoid finite volume effects .",
    "we check finite lattice spacing effects comparing results obtained on lattices with @xmath16 and 6 at two temperatures .",
    "let us emphasize that our studies are computationally much more demanding in comparison with studies undertaken in refs .",
    "@xcite , since we produce @xmath12 gribov copies per configuration to avoid gribov copies effect . for this reason",
    "our check of the continuum limit is not as extensive as it was in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the important contribution of this work to the thermal monopole studies is a check of universality . in studies of magnetic currents at zero temperature it was found  @xcite that the density of the infrared magnetic currents is different for different lattice actions with difference as large as @xmath14 .",
    "the conclusion was made that the ultraviolet fluctuations contribute to the infrared density and this contribution has to be removed .",
    "partial removal was made by the use of the improved action . in present paper",
    "we use the improved lattice action - tadpole improved symanzik action and compare our results for the density and other quantities with results obtained with the wilson action  @xcite .",
    "we find that the universality holds for monopoles which do not form short range ( ultraviolet ) dipoles .",
    "we also want to point out that in this work we use more natural procedure of computing monopole correlators in comparison with papers  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it was mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite that monopole trajectories had a lot of small loops attached to them which were uv noise .",
    "presence of such loops do not allow to determined monopole spatial coordinates unambiguously for all time slices .",
    "this problem was bypassed in  @xcite by using only one time slice .",
    "we remove the small loops attached to thermal monopole trajectories and thus we are able to determine the monopole coordinates in every time slice unambiguously .",
    "then we use all time slices to compute the correlators what allows us to decrease the statistical errors substantially .",
    "we studied the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory with the tadpole improved symanzik action :          parameter @xmath22 is the input tadpole improvement factor taken here equal to the fourth root of the average plaquette p = @xmath23 .",
    "we use the same code to generate configurations of the lattice gauge field as was used in ref .",
    "our calculations were performed on the asymmetric lattices with lattice volume @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of sites in the time ( space ) direction .",
    "the temperature @xmath10 is given by :      where @xmath27 is the lattice spacing . to determine the values of @xmath22 we used results of ref .",
    "@xcite either directly or to make interpolation to necessary values of @xmath28 .",
    "the critical value of the coupling constant for @xmath29 is @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath29 the ratio @xmath31 was obtained using data for the string tension from ref .",
    "@xcite again either directly or via interpolation . for @xmath32 ratio @xmath31",
    "was taken to be equal to the ratio for @xmath29 multiplied by factor @xmath33 . in  table",
    "[ tab : lattice_size ] we provide the information about the gauge field ensembles and parameters used in our study .",
    "we apply the simulated annealing ( sa ) algorithm which proved to be very efficient for this gauge  @xcite as well as for other gauges such as center gauges  @xcite and landau gauge  @xcite . to further decrease the gribov copy effects we generated @xmath12 gribov copies per configuration starting every time gauge fixing procedure from a randomly selected gauge copy of the original monte carlo configuration ."
