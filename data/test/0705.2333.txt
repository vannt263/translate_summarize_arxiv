    "it is well known that the galactic centre region (  gcr  ) has remarkable properties , and it is not surprising that the cosmic ray (  cr  ) view has singular interest .",
    "concerning molecular gas , some 10% of such gas in the galaxy is to be found in the central 200 pc radius (  morris and serabyn , 1996 , to be denoted i  ) .",
    "the magnitude is quoted as @xmath4 ( i ) , with probably  @xmath5 in the region of concern here , @xmath6 ( tsuboi et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "the mean density is very high , @xmath7 , in many of the clouds and the filling factor similarly high : @xmath8 .",
    "the mean temperature is elevated , being typically 70k (  in the range 30k - 200k  ) ( i ) .",
    "surrounding the molecular clouds is a very hot plasma of ` temperature ' 10 - 15 kev ( i ) , a value which is so high as to need the presence in the past of very energetic activity , such as a giant galactic centre explosion and/or the explosion of many sn within the central parsec over the past @xmath9years ( i ) .",
    "many measurements have indicated the existence of a magnetic field of several mg , with both tangled and smooth components .",
    "a prominent feature is the presence of field tubes nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane ( i ) .",
    "sgra * comprises a compact central object containing a radio source with a flat spectrum .",
    "it is almost certain that a black hole of mass @xmath10 is involved ( i ) .    of many other unusual features associated with the gcr",
    ", mention should be made of the high velocity winds (  500 - 1000 @xmath11  ) (  breitschwerdt et al.,2002  ; vlk and zirakashvili,2004  ) associated particularly with the region sgrb2 (  eg sunyaev et al . , 1993  ) .",
    "particular remarks should be directed to the energetics of the gcr ; we are mindful of the fact that , locally , the energy densities of cr , starlight , magnetic fields and gas motion are all equal at @xmath12 (  wolfendale , 1983  ) . in the gcr we estimate , from the published data given in ( i ) , that the energy densities of plasma , the far - infra - red radiation , magnetic fields and gas motion are all several thousand @xmath13 (  indeed , the magnetic energy density will be higher still over limited volumes  ) .",
    "the features listed above all lead to particular interest in the gamma ray signal from the general region of the galactic centre",
    ". early work by sas ii (  thompson et al.,1976  ) , cosb (  mayer - hasselwandler et al.,1982  ) and cgro (  mayer - hasselwandler et al.,1998 ; hartmann et al.,1999  ) in the 100 mev region showed that the cr intensity there was probably not very different from that locally , but the angular resolution was too poor for detailed study .",
    "more recently , cangaroo (  tsuchiya et al.,2004  ) , veritas (  kosack et al.,2004  ) , hess (  aharonian et al.,2004  ) and magic (  albert et al.,2006  ) have observed the gc in sub - tev and tev gamma rays .",
    "now , hess , with its superior angular resolution (  @xmath14  ) coupled with its higher energy range (   from hundreds of gev to tens of tev  ) , offers the possibility of another window on this dramatic region (  aharonian et al . , 2006  ) and we shall base our analysis mainly on this latest work .",
    "over the years we have examined the implications of cosmic ray acceleration in supernova remnants ( snr ) for a wide variety of cr phenomena .",
    "a strong case has been made for such acceleration providing the bulk of cr up to @xmath15 ( eg erlykin and wolfendale , 2001 ) and perhaps - for a special class of snr - beyond ( biermann , 1993 ; sveshnikova , 2003 ; erlykin and wolfendale , 2005  ) .",
    "gamma ray astronomy provides a proxy indicator of cr in distant parts of the galaxy by way of gamma ray production in cr - interstellar gas collisions and cr interaction with magnetic and photon fields .",
    "a problem is that the nature of the cr ( nuclei or electrons ) is not known , _ a priori _ , and also there are often difficulties with the determination of the necessary column density of gas .",
    "nevertheless , in the absence of better ways of studying the origin of cr , we proceed , noting particularly that high energy electrons - those necessary for tev gamma rays - will be severely inhibited by the @xmath1 magnetic fields , whether they be primary or secondary (  in any event , the flux of secondary electrons well away from the source will be very small  ) .    hess has given contours of the tev gamma ray emission from the exciting galactic centre region (  gcr  ) , specifically , that bounded by @xmath16 (  http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/hess  ) .",
    "the ` map ' is characterized by ` point source ' emission from the ` compound snr ' @xmath17 and from sgra * , very close to the nominal gc .",
    "following the analysis of the hess group , we consider the region : @xmath18 and @xmath19 . figure 1 shows the profile of the ` intensity ' ( actually the counts ) as a function of longitude (  aharonian et al.,2006  ) .",
    "the result of subtracting the two point sources ( @xmath20 and sgr a * ) is indicated .",
    "the workers used the known point spread function ( psf ) for this subtraction .",
    "the background has been also subtracted .",
    "the authors point out that the diffuse gamma - ray emission diminishes with longitude in the studied region and fades away at @xmath21 inspite of the fact that there is a substantial amount of gas at least at positive longitudes of @xmath22 .",
    "they explain this profile assuming that gamma rays are produced in cr - gas collisions and cr have a gaussian distribution around the gc with a best fit width of @xmath23 .    in what follows",
    "we draw the physical scenario of the observed features .",
    "we examine the possibility that our snr model has validity here , too , viz that snr are the sources and that the cr propagate in a diffusive manner .",
    "specifically , we assume that many snr occurred near the gc during the last @xmath24 years , (  and extending back , perhaps , even longer  ) as already suggested . as in the hess group scenario the gamma rays came from the interactions of cr protons from snr with the ambient high density gas , essentially all the gamma rays from sgra * coming from the burst of snr , the remainder (  from the gcr  ) coming either from the burst of snr or the conventional sn in the gcr (  which would surely be expected in view of the considerable amount of stellar activity  ) .    .",
    "two point sources have been removed , as indicated by dashed lines .",
    "the solid line is the column density of molecular hydrogen between the same latitude limits normalised to the same total area .",
    "the dashed line shows the gamma - ray flux expected if the cr density distribution can be described by a gaussian centred at @xmath25 and with rms 0.8@xmath26 (  following the analysis of the hess group  ) .,width=453,height=264 ]      many measurements have been made of the distribution of gas in the gc region , most notably using co ( eg bania et al .",
    ", 1977 , oka et al",
    ". , 1998 ) and cs ( tsuboi et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "an apparent feature , common to all analyses , is the very high density of gas ( @xmath27 ) in the region .",
    "as the last authors have remarked , there are peculiar structures here which are ` presumably related to the unique activity in the gc region ' .",
    "the hess group used the cs data to give the consequent column density of molecular hydrogen and we have done the same , although we have applied a correction for the loss of lower density molecular gas from the work of dame et al.,2001 for the region @xmath28 .    at the beginning we tried to find the general characteristics of cr in the gc region .",
    "unlike the hess group s assumptions about the gaussian distribution of cr around the gc we adopted a uniform distribution in this area and started with the local value of the cr intensity . using our emissivity of the yield of gamma rays per hydrogen atom for the local cr spectrum ( erlykin and wolfendale , 2003 ) we have derived @xmath29 - the ratio of the observed / expected gamma ray intensity with the result shown in figure 2 . if the observed gamma rays originate indeed from cr - gas collisions the gas distribution is eliminated from @xmath29 and this ratio gives the actual cr longitudinal profile compared with the assumed uniform distribution . the possible contribution of electrons is ignored in this assumption following the arguments in  2 .    the mean value of @xmath30 averaged over the interval of @xmath31 is @xmath32 for the total flux including the central source . without the central source it is @xmath33 .",
    "it is with the interpretation of this plot that we shall be mainly concerned .      of likely relevance",
    "is the radio map for the same region .",
    "figure 2 shows the average intensity over @xmath19 derived by us from the 5 ghz data of altenhof et al . , 1979 , that , for 10 ghz is very similar (  handa et al.,1987  ) .",
    "its relevance will be considered briefly here and in more detail in  5.3 .",
    "inspection of figure 2 shows that there is a correlation between the excess cr intensity and the radio emission intensity and this is quantified in figure 3 .",
    "the slope of the straight line fit is 0.96@xmath340.11 and the corrrelation coefficient is 0.85 ; there is thus strong evidence for linearity .",
    "although some of the radio photons come from discrete sources (  young pulsars , etc  ) and snr at the ` centers ' of the condensed contours many come from surrounding regions and are due to cr electrons (  from old pulsars , snr etc  ) undergoing synchrotron radiation in the strong magnetic fields in the region , together with a thermal contribution , which in fact is greater than the non - thermal (  ie from synchrotron radiation  ) at this frequency .",
    "in fact , the thermal contribution , too , is (  statistically  ) correlated with the sites of snr from reasons of energetics .    of importance is the fact that the positions of the peak intensities in the maps at 5 ghz , 10 ghz , 60@xmath35 (  iras  ) , 10 ghz , 5 ghz and 2.7 ghz (  effelsberg : http://www.mpifr",
    ". + de / old_mpifr / survey.html  ) are all coincident with the peaks in the cr plot (  figure 2  ) .",
    "they are not coincident with the peaks in the column density of gas (  figure 1  ) .",
    "the likelihood of the radio flux being an indicator of the distribution of snr (  present and past  ) in the gcr is enhanced by the linear size distribution of the excesses in figure 2 , as will be demonstrated later .",
    "we start with figure 1 . it is interesting , and perhaps very significant , to note the large discrepancy in the region between @xmath36 and @xmath37 between the column density of gas and the measured gamma ray intensity - a discrepancy that would not exist if the cr intensity were constant . in other words",
    ", there is a significant fraction of the gas in the gcr (  some 18%  ) that is under - populated by cr .",
    "it is this mass of gas , beyond @xmath38 , that makes the gas non - symmetric about the galactic centre .",
    "the question of symmetry in the various gcr properties is taken up again later .",
    "moving to figure 2 , a number of remarks can be made .    *",
    "the likelihood of systematic errors in the inferred column density of molecular hydrogen means that the absolute values of the enhancement in cr intensity ratio (  denoted @xmath29  ) are uncertain .",
    "however , the shape of the longitude - dependence should be reasonable . * there should be a trend of diminishing r ( @xmath39 ) with increasing @xmath40 if our contention about diffusion of cr from sources in sgra * is correct .",
    "* some measure of correlation of r ( @xmath39 ) with the integrated radio intensity should occur if , as has been remarked , there are snr in the gcr itself . an alternative way of approaching this problem is in terms of cr diffusion - in high b regions there will be a smaller diffusion coefficient because of increased turbulence .",
    "inspection of figure 1 shows that the gamma ray excess falls down slightly when receding from the galactic centre , ie with increasing @xmath40 and , correspondingly , the cr intensity also falls .",
    "certainly the gcr is a singular region with unique properties .",
    "any extrapolation of its characteristics to the wider longitude range should be taken with care . however , taking into account the large errors in the observed intensity of the diffuse gamma rays and uncertainty in the column density of the gas we can not rule out a weaker longitude dependence of the cr intensity in the wider longitude range of the inner galaxy , than is indicated in figure 2 .",
    "the analysis of the diffuse gamma - ray profile at lower gev energies obtained with the sasii satellite indicated a weak radial cr gradient in the inner galaxy , (  issa and wolfendale,1981  ) , as did the cgro satellite (  strong and mattox,1996  ) .",
    "the cr intensity in the inner galaxy does not exceed the local value by a factor of more than 1.2 .",
    "if our latter value of the excess equal to 1.83@xmath340.15 can be extrapolated into a wider longitude region than @xmath41 , it might mean that the cr gradient for sub - tev and tev energies is stronger than for gev energies , as has been predicted by us (  erlykin and wolfendale , 2002  ) .",
    "our model , to be tested , comprises sn which have exploded in the central region (   together , probably , with the normal quota of snr associated with the gas in general  ) , providing protons which diffuse away and permeate the molecular gas , in which they produce secondary pions and thereby gamma rays .",
    "it is supposed that recent sn provide the peak at the position of sgra * itself ( to be discussed later ) .    in figure 4",
    "we show the gamma - ray profile expected from a single sn which exploded either @xmath42 or @xmath43 years ago .",
    "calculations have been made for both ` normal ' and ` anomalous ' diffusion (  the distinction relates to the nature of the scattering centres in the interstellar medium  ) .",
    "briefly , the difference between them can be reduced to two basic features : + ( i ) the diffusion radius @xmath44 for anomalous diffusion depends linearly on time as @xmath45 while for normal diffusion @xmath46 .",
    "both radii are normalized to 1 kpc at the time equal to the mean life time of cr particles for the particular energy ; + ( ii ) the lateral distribution function of the cr density @xmath47 for anomalous diffusion is not gaussian as for normal diffusion , but has a more complicated shape : @xmath48 . + the difference between these two diffusion modes is discussed in more detail in lagutin,2001 , erlykin and wolfendale , 2002 , erlykin , lagutin and wolfendale , 2003 .    the effective averaged gas density in our calculations for the region in question @xmath49 is @xmath50 (  this being much less than the high values of @xmath51 quoted because of the presence in our studied volume of a large volume of low density material and the filling factor , ie the fraction of space occupied by the high density molecular gas  ) .",
    "it is seen that there is no sharp peak in the centre even for the youngest sn with an age of @xmath42 years .",
    "the fall of the intensity with longitude in the wings is too strong to be compatible with the experiment . if we reduce the age below @xmath42 years the sharpness of the peak increases but the fall of the intensity in the wings increases too .",
    "therefore , to get agreement with experiment both in the central peak and in the wings ( figures 1 and 2 ) we can not use just a single sn and need the succession of sn explosions distributed in time .    in figure 5",
    "we show the results of the calculation for a succession of sn in sgra*. two sets of sn rates are taken : @xmath52 sn in @xmath42 years and @xmath53 sn in @xmath43 years with the uniform temporal distribution of sn explosions within these time intervals . since the average rate in both cases is 1 sn in 100 years the diffusion approximation for cr from some young sn and large distances from the gc can not be valid because the cr velocity can not exceed the speed of light .",
    "we have introduced limitations for this effect and have found that the gamma - ray intensity at @xmath54 decreased by @xmath01.6% . in all subsequent calculations we applied these limitaions .    in figure 5 the (  important  ) sharp spike , which results mainly from snr younger than about 10@xmath55 years ,",
    "from which the cr do not diffuse very far , is a consequence of anomalous diffusion .",
    "normal diffusion gives a much weaker spike (  see also figure 4  ) . in practice , in view of the sources being in sgra",
    "* itself , where the density is very much higher than 100@xmath56 , the peak will be even higher .",
    "the other , later sn will have given particles which have diffused out to permeate more of the molecular material in the gcr .    the extent to which the idealised lateral distributions in figure 5 would be modified using the actual column density of gas (  rather than gas of constant density  ) , averaging over the galactic latitude interval @xmath57 and applying the correction for the finite angular resolution of the telescope of @xmath58 , can be seen in figure 6 .",
    "the general trend is seen to be preserved . for the comparison we also provide the results of hess observations .",
    "the difference between the absolute values of calculated and observed intensities is discussed below .",
    "guidance as to the frequency of sn comes from remarks in a variety of works (  eg i  ) that of order @xmath52 sn in @xmath42 years to @xmath53 sn over the past @xmath43 years would have been sufficient to provide the energy necessary for the very strong wind and other features visible in this unique region of the galaxy .",
    "production over a longer period seems unlikely , although it must be said that there is some evidence for a bout of star formation between 3@xmath59 and 7@xmath59 years age (  krabbe et al .",
    ", 1995  ) .",
    "it must be admitted that the manner in which the particles diffuse in this region is debatable both by way of the diffusion coefficient to adopt and the manner of diffusion , viz ` normal ' or ` anomalous ' .",
    "we consider that , in view of the disturbed conditions in the region and highly non - uniform distribution of gas , the mode of diffusion in the very central region at least will be anomalous ( erlykin , lagutin and wolfendale , 2003 ) . concerning the diffusion coefficient , in the absence of clear information",
    "we adopt the ` local ' value ( pertaining to the galaxy as a whole ) .",
    "it is easiest to consider this region alone to start with . with only one sn , young enough",
    "that the particles are sufficiently confined to the region as to give gamma rays which are well within the point spread function (  psf  ) of the detector @xmath14 , the predicted flux can be taken from our earlier work ( erlykin , wolfendale , 2003 ) @xmath60 here , for a start , we adopt for the sn explosion energy @xmath61 , the gas density @xmath62 , the distance to the gc @xmath63 and the fraction of the sn explosion energy transferred to cr , @xmath64 , as usual ( berezhko et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath65 is the efficiency - factor , which is actually a ratio of the observed gamma - ray intensity to that expected for a standard model of the cr production , to be determined from the observations .",
    "@xmath65 can , of course , be much less than unity if the physical conditions in the snr differ considerably from the conventional ones , resulting in weaker shocks , etc .",
    "the result is @xmath66 .    following the hess work , we adopt 0.38 tev as the threshold energy and , using the measured spectrum of gamma rays ( with differential exponent @xmath67 ) , the observed total flux from the gc including the point source at sgra * is + @xmath68 + @xmath69 + taken at face value , this would require , for one sn alone , @xmath70 .",
    "thus , for 100 or 1000 sn we would need @xmath71 or @xmath72 it is evident that there is no shortage of energy in the snr hypothesis .",
    "later observations have given slightly different values of the fluxes and threshold energy but our arguments are unchanged .",
    "figures 5 and 6 allow us to make a more accurate estimate .",
    "the flux from the spike within @xmath73 would qualify as that from the discrete source insofar as its finite width would not be detected in the presence of a psf with the half width at half maximum of @xmath58 (  which has a wide tail  )",
    ".    of the two situations considered , it is evident that 10@xmath3 sn in 10@xmath55 years gives too steep a lateral distribution (  comparing figure 5 with figure 2  ) but the shape for 10@xmath74 sn in 10@xmath75 years is close . here ,",
    "for @xmath73 , we predict a flux of @xmath76 for the case of anomalous diffusion .",
    "the observed flux is @xmath77 so that @xmath78 for this case .",
    "as remarked already it is evident that the fall of predicted gamma ray intensity with increasing longitude is about right to explain the gamma ray profile for @xmath53 sn in @xmath43 years .",
    "there is a problem , however , in that the inner wings of the predicted distribution , from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , are too strong .",
    "a likely explanation here is in terms of a non - uniform temporal distribution .",
    "an estimate of the expected flux in the ridge can be derived from figure 6 : it is @xmath81 . with the efficiency factor of @xmath82 derived for the sources in sgra",
    "* we have @xmath83 , to be compared with the observed @xmath84 .",
    "the result is close , although we have to admit that many parameters involved in the calculations are uncertain .",
    "this is where the snr , which undoubtedly must be present in the ridge material itself , may assume importance .",
    "their likely number can be estimated . as follows . for the galaxy as a whole , with molecular mass @xmath85 (  dame et al . , 2001  ) and",
    "sn rate @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 .",
    "it is likely that this value is also appropriate to the ridge region so that in @xmath88 , with a mass of @xmath89 , we expect 44 . in fact , the number may be nearer 10 in view of the dependence of snr density on column density of molecular hydrogen being slower than linear , more nearly to the power 0.6 (  using the summary of fatemi and wolfendale , 1996 for snr , pulsars and @xmath90  ) . assuming that these sn give the same contribution to the flux in the wings as the central sn and using the calculated flux in the ridge for 1000 central sn of @xmath81 and observed flux of @xmath91 , the derived @xmath65 - value is @xmath8 .",
    "a measure of validity for the view of a significant , or even major , contribution from the conventional snr comes from the cr - radio correlation (  figure 3 and ",
    "three of the diffuse radio sources appear in the snr catalogue of green (  2000  ) and in general we would expect the radio map to be a good indicator of past and present snr .",
    "a similar situation arises for the radio map and identified snr for the large and small magellanic clouds (  mills and turtle,1984  ) .",
    "a natural explanation would exist for the bumps in figure 2 in terms of snr , in view of the expected profiles of cr - produced gamma rays shown in figure 4 ; snr of (  typical  ) age a few 10@xmath55 years would have profiles similar to the bumps in figure 2 . specifically , the mean half - width of the bumps which can be resolved is @xmath92 and this is just what would be expected for about 10 sn having exploded in the last @xmath43 years .",
    "so far , therefore , there seem to be two possibilities to explain the results .",
    "firstly , there were @xmath53 sn in @xmath43 years in sgra * , the cr diffusing through the ridge causing the ridge emission and the recent sn giving cr very close to sgra * which caused the point source .",
    "the problem is that the needed gas density to get the observed ratio of ridge flux to sgra * point source flux is very low , by sgra * standards .",
    "secondly , perhaps the snr in the ridge itself were responsible for the cr there .",
    "the number of sn in sgra * could then be smaller , with higher density gas allowed .",
    "the problem with the high intensity predicted in the range @xmath93 to @xmath94 or @xmath95 would then be minimized - it would be due simply to a statistical fluctuation .",
    "there are many phenomena which could contribute to @xmath65 being less then unity for the unusual conditions in the gcr .",
    "these are , mainly ,    * the possibility that the majority of sn there are not of type ii - the main sources of snr which accelerate cr to very high energies . *",
    "the high gas density causes the sedov radius ( which is proportional to @xmath96 , axford , 1981 ) to be small ; specifically it falls to only a few pc . the time taken to reach this radius , after which cr acceleration is reduced , is probably too short for efficient acceleration , despite the increased magnetic field in the gcr . *",
    "the high gas density probably causes the injection efficiency to be low (  drury et al . , 1996 and private communication  ) , the point being that ionization losses will be considerable during injection for the sub - relativistic particles .",
    "* the tube - like magnetic fields , referred to in  1 , which will convey particles out of the galaxy .",
    "* a very likely effect relates to the galactic wind .",
    "this is currently very strong in the gcr ( eg breitschwerdt et al.,2002 ; vlk and zirakashvili,2004 ; sunyaev et al 1993 ) - with a velocity of a few thousand @xmath97 .",
    "concerning item 1 , it seems unlikely that there is a shortage of the necessary massive pre - sn stars .",
    "indeed , in parts ( eg sgrb2 ) , there are unusually massive stars being produced furiously (  i  )",
    ". presumably the high rate of sn production overall in the gcr , and particularly in sgra * , gives rise to many type ii sn .",
    "the other factors are , therefore , considered to be the relevant ones .      a well known feature of the cr distribution in the galaxy as a whole - as inferred from gamma ray data - is the smallness of the ` cr gradient ' , i.e. the dependence of cr intensity on galactocentric radius , r ( eg erlykin et al . , 1996 ; hunter , 2001 . ) and we believe that this has relevance , here .",
    "as is well known , the gradient for cr is far less than that for the ( assumed ) parent snr .",
    "a number of possibilities have been put forward , involving , for example , galactic winds (  breitschwerdt et al.,2002 ; vlk and zirakashvili,2004  ) and radial dependent diffusion coefficients (  erlykin and wolfendale , 2002  ) .",
    "the results from the present analysis of the gcr lead to our suggesting that the efficiency of cr production by snr compared with the standard model where 10% of the explosion energy is transformed into cr , is dependent on the nominal gas density of the ambient medium into which the sn expands .",
    "it will be apparent from the start that the low implied cr intensity at the gc despite the large number of snr is in the spirit of a gas density dependent snr efficiency .",
    "in figure 7 we present the ` cr efficiency ' , given here as the ratio of inferred cr intensity , i(cr ) to the surface density of snr ( as used by us previously , erlykin and wolfendale , 2005 ) versus the surface density of molecular hydrogen , @xmath98 , as well as the gc values .",
    "the fall - off of efficiency with @xmath99 is very marked .      at this stage",
    "it is not possible to decide between the two models but the mixed model (  ie sn in both sgra * and the ridge  ) appears more likely .",
    "the @xmath65-values for the two situations are given in figure 7 .",
    "consideration can be given to each region in turn .",
    "* sgra**. one hundred sn is probably the smallest that can be allowed , and able to give the necessary energy injection for the high wind , plasma temperature , etc .",
    "thus , for one thousand sn the figure is @xmath82 ( not much smaller because much of the cr energy escapes from the central region  ) .    * the galactic ridge*. for 10 sources",
    ", we have @xmath100 .",
    "the values are plotted in figure 7 .",
    "the abscissae are illustrative in that they are the approximate surface densities of gas for the regimes in question . also shown in figure 7",
    "is the result for the source g0.9 + 0.1 , which appears to be due to a single snr .",
    "it should be remarked that the region in which the sn exploded is outside the region of high gas density and thus the efficiency might be expected to be comparatively high .",
    "it is relevant to see to what extent the results reported here have correspondence in the gev region . to this end",
    "we have examined the cgro observations reported by hunter et al .",
    "(  1997  ) ; these results referring to energy ranges from 30/100 mev to @xmath101 mev . considering the results for @xmath102 , the region for @xmath103 has a spectrum flatter than the surroundings by @xmath104 , when attention is devoted to the contribution from interactions with molecular hydrogen alone .",
    "this is in the spirit of that reported here for hess , where the spectrum of gamma rays in the gcr is flatter than average , by @xmath105 .",
    "bearing in mind the inferior angular resolution of cgro and the quoted errors , the difference in the @xmath106-values is understandable .    of interest , too , is the fact that there are small gamma - ray excesses for @xmath107 , @xmath101 mev at @xmath39-values where there are also peaks in the 408 mhz maps of haslam et al .",
    "(  1981  ) . specifically , of 23 peaks in the radio map above a consistent height (  50k compared with a central region of height @xmath0450k and an anti - centre level of @xmath050k  ) some 14 coincide with gamma ray excesses .",
    "thus , the gcr correlation of gamma - ray excesses with radio intensity seems to have a counterpart at gev energies .",
    "the hess group appear not to have analysed the results from as detailed a standpoint as we ourselves ; instead , they take an empirical approach by way of fitting a gaussian to the cosmic ray distribution (  see figure 1  ) in gcr and a point source in the gc itself . this",
    "can perhaps be regarded as a zero order approach .",
    "some general remarks about the analysis are in order . in ",
    "1 we discussed the general energetics of the gcr and pointed out the very high - and nearly equal - energy densities of the major components .",
    "the cosmic ray energy density is clearly lower by 3 orders of magnitude . of the discrepancies , that between the magnetic field and the cr energy density is , at first sight , hardest to understand .",
    "locally (  ie in the solar system  ) there is equality and good reasons have been put forward in terms of trapping , but this must break down in the gcr . presumably , the reason is the field geometry , ie the outward- directed nature of the high field flux - tubes , which helps to lose cr , unlike locally , where the magnetic field acts to contain them .",
    "another topic needing discussion is that relating to symmetry - and lack of it .",
    "inspection of figure 1 shows the distinct lack of symmetry of the density of molecular gas about an axis through the galactic centre along @xmath108 .",
    "specifically , the symmetry in the column density versus longitude plane (  figure 1  ) is about @xmath109 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to that for the cr intensity , (  figure 2  ) , which is about @xmath110 and , indeed , the gamma ray intensity itself (  figure 1  ) , which is about @xmath111 .",
    "the radio intensity (  figure 2  ) is also symmetrical about @xmath110 .",
    "of particular interest is the map for 60@xmath35 (  uchida et al.,1996  ) , this radiation arising from hot dust ; for this map there is symmetry about @xmath110 .",
    "most importantly , the 60@xmath35 has almost disappeared by @xmath112 , clearly , the dust in the anomalous region , @xmath113 to @xmath114 , is cold. this result is in accord with our contention that the cr intensity is very low there , by virtue of the (  chance  ) paucity of recent sn .",
    "the main results can be summarised thus .",
    "supernova remnants can be invoked to explain the hess results for the galactic centre region .",
    "the rate for the sgra * region , @xmath53 sn in @xmath43 years , as recommended by other work (  i  ) , gives a consistent picture , although somewhat fewer , taken with conventional snr in the ridge , is preferred .",
    "the consistent picture requires particularly low snr efficiency - factors for sgra * (  but less so for the ridge if conventional snr play a role  )",
    ". taken together with results from the well - known small cr - gradient in the galaxy as a whole , they lead to a satisfying smooth dependence of efficiency factor on local molecular density . the ideas put forward in  5.4 would be expected to give such a dependence .",
    "an interesting feature is the correlation of cr intensity with smoothed radio intensity .",
    "we regard this as providing support for the idea that sn in the ridge are important .",
    "the cgro data in the sub - gev and gev region are consistent insofar as they , too , give a somewhat flatter gamma ray spectral exponent for the gcr than for the rest and there are correlations of intensity excesses with spikes in the radio map .",
    "the very high magnetic field inhibits high energy electrons , thereby enabling conclusions about protons (  more accurately , nuclei  ) to be drawn .",
    "one of authors ( ade ) thanks the royal society and the university of durham for financial support .",
    "we also thank l.oc.drury , t.bell , p.m.chadwick and j.l.osborne for helpful comments .",
    "remarks by the referees of a previous version of this paper were particularly useful ; we thank them .",
