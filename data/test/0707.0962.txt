    "in statistical mechanics , thermodynamic laws are recovered at the level of ensemble averages .",
    "the past decade has brought new insights into nonequilibrium statistical mechanics due to the discovery of various types of fluctuation relations valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "these relations identify , at the level of the single realization of a statistical ensemble , the `` trajectory entropy '' which upon ensemble averaging reproduce the thermodynamic entropy .",
    "they therefore quantify the statistical significance of nonthermodynamic behaviors which can become significant in small systems @xcite .",
    "various experimental verifications of these fts have been reported @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we consider an open system , described by a master equation ( me ) , exchanging matter and energy with multiple reservoirs . the system can be externally driven by varying its energies or the different temperature or chemical potentials of the reservoirs .",
    "there are three mechanisms for bringing such a system out of equilibrium : preparing it in a nonequilibrium state , externally driving it , or putting it in contact with multiple reservoirs at different temperatures or chemical potentials thus breaking the detailed balance condition ( dbc ) .",
    "we show that each of these mechanism makes a distinct contribution to the total entropy production ( ep ) generated by the nonequilibrium dynamics of the system .",
    "the two first contributions are nonzero only if the system is not in its steady state and are therefore called nonadiabatic .",
    "the third contribution is equal to the ep for slow transformation during which the system remains in a steady - state and is therefore called adiabatic .",
    "we derive three fts , for the total ep and its nonadiabatic and adiabatic contribution and show that they lead to exact inequalities valid arbitrary far from equilibrium .",
    "previously derived fts are recovered by considering specific types of nonequilibrium transformations .",
    "steady state fts @xcite are obtained for systems maintained in a nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) between reservoirs with different thermodynamic properties .",
    "the jarzynski or crooks type fts @xcite are derived for systems initially at equilibrium with a single reservoir which are externally driven out of equilibrium by an external force .",
    "the hatano - sasa ft @xcite is recovered for externally driven systems initially in a ness with multiple reservoirs .",
    "+ to calculate the statistical properties of the various contributions to the total ep and to demonstrate the fts , we extend the generating function ( gf ) method @xcite to driven open systems .",
    "apart from providing clear proofs of the various fts , this method is useful for simulations because it does not require to explicitly generate the stochastic trajectories .",
    "some additional insight is provided by using an alternative derivation of the fts similar to the crooks derivation @xcite , where the total ep and its nonadiabatic part can be identified in terms of forward - backward trajectory probabilities . by doing so",
    ", we connect the trajectory approach previously used for driven closed systems @xcite with the gf approach used for steady state systems @xcite .",
    "+ we propose to experimentally test these new fts in a driven single orbital quantum dot where the various entropy probability distributions can be measured by the full electron counting statistics which keeps track of the four possible types of electron transfer ( in and out of the dot through either lead ) .",
    "such measurements of the bidirectional counting statistics have become feasible recently @xcite .",
    "we calculate the entropy probability distributions , analyze their behavior as the driving is varied between the sudden and the adiabatic limits , and verify the validity of the fts . + in section [ mastereq ] we present our stochastic model and in section [ entropy ] we describe the various contributions to the total ep generated during a nonequilibrium transformation and the inequalities that these contributions satisfy . in section [ trajectory ] , we define the various trajectory entropies which upon ensemble averaging give the various contributions to the ep .",
