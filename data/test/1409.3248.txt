    "a review of reverberation lag measurements in binaries and agn can be found in @xcite .    the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _ ( _ nustar _ ; @xcite ) mission has deployed the first hard x - ray ( above 10kev ) focusing satellite .",
    "it features two telescopes , focusing x - rays between 3 and 79kev onto two identical focal planes ( usually called focal plane modules a and b , or fpma and fpmb ) .",
    "it has a field of view ( fov ) of 12@xmath412and an angular resolution of 18fwhm ; ( 58hpd ) .",
    "these features , together with good spectral resolution in the iron k band ( @xmath00.4kev@6kev ) , have motivated a large number of observations of x - ray binaries .",

    "the satellite has in fact been used to perform timing analysis on selected targets with very good results : for example , it was used to study a number of accreting and rotation - powered pulsars , permitting the detection of variable cyclotron resonant scattering features @xcite and the discovery of strong hard time lags in the emission of another accreting pulsar ( gs 0834 - 430 ; @xcite ) . _ nustar_was also used to detect the pulsations from a magnetar near the galactic center @xcite and to carry out a detailed timing study of this serendipitous source @xcite .",
    "these pulsars are mostly slow rotators , with pulse periods above 1s .",
    "aperiodic timing has been measured in faint sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or in bright sources but only over the low - frequency part of the power spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from the point of view of fast ( @xmath6hz ) timing studies of bright sources , however ,",
    "s default observing mode requires care to analyze properly .",
    "each x - ray incident on a focal plane produces a trigger , and the energy signal is read out immediately .",
    "the read time is dependent on the number of triggered pixels , and so the dead time for each event is slightly variable ( at the few percent level ) with an average value of @xmath7ms .",
    "this dead time , together with additional dead time produced on a separate cadence by housekeeping operations and vetoed events , can be accurately measured and its value over a second is stored in the housekeeping files of the observations .",
    "in addition , the live time since the previous x - ray event is recorded in a column in the event lists ( see section  sec : deadtime for details ) . for bright sources where the fraction of events vetoed by the anti coincidence system is small , light curves can be accurately produced with any time binning ( see madsen et al 2014 , _ submitted _",
    ", for application of this technique to the crab pulsar ) .",
    "however , for timing analysis ( e.g. the production of power density spectra ) , the dead time introduces spurious correlations between event arrival times that are reflected in a distortion of the power spectrum , making it difficult to subtract the poisson noise level above @xmath8hz .",
    "this effect is almost completely negligible for count rates up to @xmath9@xmath10 , but it is very pronounced in observations of galactic x - ray binaries during outbursts , with typical incident count rates @xmath11@xmath10over the full band .    in this paper , we present a technique to avoid spurious noise introduced by dead time , in particular the distortion of the white noise level in the power spectrum .",
    "we show how a slight modification to the methods commonly used for quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) detection and power spectral fitting enables good - quality results at all frequencies .",

    "instrument is produced when the focal plane module electronics are busy processing an event , when the shield veto prevents the focal plane from triggering ( or interrupts an event that is being processed ) , and for some regular instrument housekeeping functions ( the housekeeping produces less than 1 ms of dead time per second ) .",

    "the fraction per second of dead time from events that are not processed , like shield vetoes , as well as that due to housekeeping functions is saved in the housekeeping files on a one - second cadence . for light curves binned in 1  s intervals ( or a integer multiple thereof ) multiplying by the live time stored in the housekeeping files correctly accounts for dead time .",

    "this mode adding the prior column does not yield the proper live time since vetoed events are not included .",

    "2014 , _ submitted _ ) . for sources of intermediate brightness , where the veto rate can not be ignored",
    ", a fully tested and calibrated instrument mode exists that includes vetoed events in the data stream so that fluxes and light curves can be produced with arbitrary accuracy .    for timing analyses that involve power spectral analysis ,",
    "dead time produces systematic effects even if it is perfectly measured .",
    "dead time is classified as either paralyzable or non - paralyzable depending on whether a photon hitting the detector during dead time produces new dead time or not .",
    "the _ nustar _",
    "readout architecture produces non - paralyzable dead time .",
    "its main effect is on recorded count rates : if we have an incident rate of photons @xmath14 , the detected count rate will be approximately @xmath15 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , where @xmath16is the dead time produced by each event , assuming that it is constant .",
    "but dead time also alters the sensitivity to variable signals , acting as a frequency filter .",
    "power density spectra ( pds ) , in particular , are deformed to a `` wavy '' shape that depends on the magnitude of dead time and on count rates ( see figure  fig : cpdsvspds ) .",
    "power at frequencies slightly above @xmath17 is _ quenched _ , as there is a lack of events whose separation is less than @xmath18 , while there is a relatively higher rate above @xmath18 , and therefore the power at frequencies just below @xmath17 is slightly _ amplified_. these `` waves '' have nodes at @xmath17 and multiples thereof , where the power ( in @xcite normalization ) is equal to 2 , the value that it would have without dead time , and maxima and minima in between are given by the relative contribution of the quenching and amplification . for frequencies",
    "@xmath19 , the main effect is a general deficiency of events , and the power has a decreasing level that approaches @xmath20 @xcite . assuming that @xmath16is the same for each event and that only source events contribute to either non - paralyzable or paralyzable dead time , this distortion can be modeled precisely ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for an exhaustive treatment ) . also , some statistical properties of the pds hold in dead time - affected data . for example , the standard deviation associated with the bin @xmath21 of the pds is always equal to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the power in the bin @xmath21 and @xmath24 is the number of averaged pdss ( see figure  fig : cpdsvspds ) .    in _",
    "nustar_@xmath16is not strictly fixed at the same value for all events , but varies by a few percent depending on the number of pixels that are triggered . for this reason , the models available in literature do not correctly describe the dead time effects for this satellite : the `` wavy '' behavior of the pds shifts slightly , and to fully account for this effect and produce a white - noise subtracted pds , a very precise modeling of the dead time would be required . since at high count rates the `` waves",
    "'' can be very prominent , any real variability feature such a qpo can easily be `` hidden '' and difficult to detect .    as an additional complication , the models described above assume that dead time is produced completely by the recorded signal . in _ nustar _ , additional dead time comes from events outside the source extraction region , from vetoed events , and from all events discarded for other reasons during the cleaning process in the pipeline ( the step from unfiltered to cleaned event files ) . in the following ,",
    "we neglect the effect of vetoed events , since their dead time ( @xmath25s ) has characteristic frequency @xmath26khz , much higher than science events , and their total contribution to dead time is small .",
    "we instead present a method that permits construction of a proxy of a white - noise subtracted pds , regardless of the count rate and the ratio between source and background ( or spurious ) events .",
    "_ nustar_has two completely independent focal plane modules ( each containing four detectors ) that are read out by separate microprocessors .",
    "it is therefore possible in principle to obtain the same information given by a pds through the so - called cross power density spectrum ( cpds ; for more details see @xcite ) : instead of considering the pdss in the two individual focal planes : @xmath27 where @xmath28 indicates the fourier transform of the lightcurve detected by the focal plane @xmath21 and @xmath29 is the frequency , one multiplies the complex conjugate of one fourier transform with the other fourier transform : @xmath30 the cpds is often used in other contexts to obtain information on the correlation between the signal in two energy bands .",
    "it is a complex quantity : its real part is also called the _ cospectrum _ and gives a measure of the signal that is _ in phase _ between the two channels ; its imaginary part , or _ quadrature spectrum _ , gives instead a measure of the _ off - phase _ signal .",
    "therefore , in principle , it should be possible to eliminate all variability that is not related between the two light curves , including the effects of dead time , by just considering the cospectrum ( the real part of the cpds ) . in figure",
    "fig : cpdsvspds we show the statistical properties of the cospectrum in the case of pure poisson noise . in both the dead time affected and in the zero - dead time cases the cospectrum mean value is 0 ( in figure  fig : cpdsvspds , it has been shifted to 2 for graphical reasons ) .",
    "this is a big advantage , as this is independent of whether the dead time is constant or not ( since the distribution of dead time is also independent between the two detectors ) , and therefore it is not necessary to conduct complicated studies of the dead time distribution in order to obtain a white noise - subtracted cospectrum , as opposed to a pds where this procedure would be needed .",
    "another important point is that the standard deviation @xmath31 of the cospectrum is linked to the standard deviations ( @xmath32 ) of the pdss of the two light curves . in figure  1 , we show that the ratio between @xmath31 and the geometric average of the standard deviations of the two pdss is close to @xmath33 regardless of the frequency .",
    "this is very convenient , as it allows us to assign to the cospectrum bin @xmath34 an uncertainty of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the geometric average of the two pdss and @xmath24 is the number of averaged pdss .",
    "the argument ( or angle ) of the cpds is called _ phase lag _ ; if we divide it by @xmath37 we obtain the _ time lag _ @xmath38 , that is a measure of the time shift between the two channels . in our case , since we are using two lightcurves in the same energy bands , we expect any time lag to be zero .",
    "but time lags between different energy bands have been used as indicators of how a signal produced in an emitting region is reprocessed in other regions : for example , if the disk emission is comptonized in a corona , or when the signal from a region is reflected or propagated in another region , this time delay between the different emissions can be detected through time lags ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . we briefly discuss time lags between different energy bands in the following sections , but for the most part our analysis will be performed on two channels in the same energy band , and the only important quantity for our treatment will be the cospectrum .    amplitude ( 8% ) at different frequencies .",
    "the units in this plot , and in all following power spectra or cospectra if not stated otherwise , are power@xmath4frequency .",
    "grey points show the standard , dead time - affected pds . the white noise level to subtract in the dead time - affected datasets was calculated between 10 and 20hz ( minimum between two qpos ) , while in the dead time - free case we subtracted the theoretical level ( 2 in leahy normalization ) . ]",
    "in order to provide a fully consistent treatment of dead time effects in the pds and in the cospectrum , we ran a large number of simulations . in each simulation",
    "we produced two event series containing variability , one for each fpm , and analyzed the data with cospectrum and pds before and after applying a dead time filter . by doing so",
    ", we studied in detail the properties of the cospectrum and compared them to those of the pds . in the following paragraphs we will explain the procedure in more detail , and demonstrate that the cospectrum can be considered a very good proxy of a white noise - subtracted pds , albeit with some corrections to account for in the measured @xmath39 .",

    "the sampling frequency of the light curves was at least four times higher than the maximum frequency of the variability components included in the simulation .",
    "we normalized the light curves in order to have the desired mean count rate and total @xmath39variability ( 7 - 10% ) . in order to be able to later calculate pdss with a given maximum timescale @xmath42 ( see `` calculation of the pdss and the cospectrum '' below ) , we simulated light curves at least 10 times longer , following the prescriptions in @xcite to avoid aliasing .",

    "indeed , it is expected that at count rates above @xmath70 , the significance starts departing from the linear trend .",

    "we found that in all observations @xmath74 was almost constantly @xmath75 , with some drops due to increased solar activity .",
    "we selected the intervals in which this ratio did nt go below a certain threshold ( ranging from 0.9 to 0.92 in different files ) , in order to eliminate possible spurious effects on the observed variability .",
    "in the subsequent analysis , we will always consider an additional 10% `` background '' event rate due to unrecorded and spurious events .",
    "we selected events from a region around each source depending on how broad the point - spread distribution was ( see the next subsections for details for each source ) .",
    "we used the barycorr ftool to calculate event times at the solar system barycenter using the de200 ephemeris and source positions from simbad .",
    "additional variability is introduced into the cross - power spectrum in some cases due to mis - matched gti between fpma and fpmb .",
    "this mis - match occurs often when the satellite traverses the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) because the automatic algorithm that turns off the focal plane modules to conserve telemetry kicks in at different thresholds for fpma and fpmb .",
    "the parameters that rule this behavior are finely tuned in order to maximize the number of photons available for spectral analysis while avoiding most of the contamination @xcite , but for timing analysis this produces unwanted effects that have to be accounted for .",
    "a signature of this variability is a strong time lag between the two detectors in the same energy band ( therefore , unrelated to the physics of the source ) , that disappears when discarding an additional interval at the gti borders or by using a more aggressive filtering during the pipeline process .",
    "we decided to use a `` safe '' additional cut of 300s at the borders of all gtis during timing analysis , and verified that it solved the problem in all affected obsids .",
    "from each barycentered event list ( section  sec : red ) we obtained light curves sampled at @xmath76s ( @xmath77s ) .",
    "we extracted separate light curves for each detector , and calculated the common good time intervals ( gtis ) .",
    "each light curve was then divided in segments ( the length was chosen in order to optimize the use of gtis ) with the start and stop times locked between the two detectors , and a fourier transform was calculated from each of them .",
    "we then calculated the cpdss from each segment by multiplying the fourier transforms as explained in section  sec : deadtime , and obtained a single cospectrum from the real part of the average of all cpdss .    when needed , we plot the error on the best - fit model as a hatched region around the model line . to calculate these errors , we ran a monte carlo markov chain on xspec to simulate 10000 models around the best fit .",

    "we described in sections  [ sec : cpds ] and  [ sec : simu ] how to calculate the cospectrum and estimate the remaining effects of dead time on the signal , namely the modulation of the variance of data bins , that can not be described using the standard @xcite prescriptions , and the equivalent change of the observed @xmath39at different frequencies and for different count rates .",
    "this estimate requires monte carlo simulations tailored to the source that is being analyzed , as described in section  sec : simu .",

    "it is apparent that the low energies are dominated by the disk emission , while at higher energies it s the reprocessed component ( comptonized and reflected ) that dominates .",
    "this is consistent with what is found in many bhbs , and in particular to what has already been reported in this source ( the  stable disk and unstable corona  picture , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in gx339@xmath14 , we observed the rising part of the outburst , in a standard low / hard state .",

    "this is consistent with what has been observed in the low / hard state of this and other sources using the pds @xcite .",
    "we do not find evidence for time lags in the sources analyzed in this paper , due to the short observing time available , but the cross power density spectrum can be used to calculate time lags without major impact from dead time , if data are adequately filtered to avoid intervals with high background activity and in particular at the start and end of each good time interval .",
    "the techniques presented in this paper can be used to perform most of the standard timing and spectral timing analysis used in literature , if the change of @xmath39with frequency and count rate is properly taken into account ( section  sec : simu ) . for slow timing ( @xmath90 ) , the dead time correction included in the official pipeline is still recommended , because it effectively corrects for all sources of dead time , including shielded events . for low count rates ( @xmath91 ) the standard pds of the sum of the two lightcurves ( what we called the `` total pds '' above ) is still advantageous , because the effects of dead time are negligible and the sensitivity of the total pds , expressed as significance of detection of a standard variability feature , is @xmath61 higher than the cospectrum .    as an additional note , this technique can be used in any satellite that has completely independent detectors , and of course by using multiple satellites .",

    "the possible spurious effects of this imperfect statistical treatment of the simulated bin value are negligible due to the small frequency bin ( simulated data are only one bin every @xmath93hz ) and the rebinning applied in the following steps of the analysis . the real and imaginary part were treated independently .    from this cleaned cpds we calculated the cospectrum .",
