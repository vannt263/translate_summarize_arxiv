    "the diffractive scattering is a process where the colliding particles scatter at very small angles and without any color flux in the final state .",
    "this involves a propagator carrying the vacuum quantum numbers , called pomeron and described , in the soft regime , within the regge theory .",
    "since the first operation period in 1992 , zeus and h1 , the two experiments dedicated to the dis physics at hera , observed that @xmath1 of lepton - proton dis events had a diffractive origin .",
    "it opens a new area of studies in diffractive production mechanism , providing a hard scale which can be varied over a wide range and therefore it is an ideal testing for qcd models .",
    "moreover , the diffractive production of vector mesons ( vms ) and real photons , allows to study the transition from the soft to the hard regime in strong interactions .",
    "the hard regime ( high energy and low bjorken-@xmath2 , @xmath3 ) is sensitive to the gluon content and well described by perturbative - qcd , while in the soft regime ( low-@xmath2 ) the interaction is well described within the regge phenomenology .",
    "indicating with @xmath4 the virtuality of the exchanged photon and with @xmath5 the square mass of the produced vm , hera data suggested a universal hard scale , @xmath6 , for the diffractive exclusive pruduction of vms and real photons , which indicates the transition from the soft to the hard regime .",
    "moreover , the diffractive production of real photons , a process known as deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , leads to the extraction of the generalized parton distribution functions ( gpds ) , containing combined imformations about the longitudinal momentum distribution of partons and their position on the trasfers plain .",
    "the gpd - based calculations will be very helpfull in the description of the higgs boson diffractive production mechanism , which will be experimentally studied with the lhc accelerator .",
    "the following sections will present the most recent results achieved at hera together with a short outlook to the future exclusive diffraction program at lhc .",
    "an introduction to a new phenomenological model for the description of the vms and dvcs amplitudes in the framework of the regge theory will be also given .",
    "the diffractive processes are characterized by the presence of a leading proton in the final state carrying most of the proton beam energy and by a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) in the forward ( proton ) direction .",
    "figure  [ diff_diag ] shows a schematic diagram of the exclusive diffractive process at hera , @xmath7 , together with the relevant kinematic variables : the photon virtuality , @xmath4 , the photon - proton centre - of - mass energy , @xmath8 , and the square of the four - momentum transfer at the proton vertex , @xmath9 .",
    "relevant kinematic variables in diffraction are also the fraction of the proton longitudinal momentum carried by the exchanged colour singlet object , @xmath10 , and the fraction of the exchanged momentum carried by the quark coupling to the virtual photon , @xmath11 .",
    "recently , a precision measurement of the reaction @xmath12 was published by zeus  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the cross section falls steeply with the increasing of @xmath4 but , unlike it was observed for the @xmath13 electroproduction  @xcite , it can not be described by a simple propagator term like @xmath14 , in particular an @xmath15 value increasing with @xmath4 appears to be favored .",
    "figure  [ q2_rho ] reports the cross section for the @xmath16 electroproduction versus @xmath4 compared with several theoretical predictions : the kwm model  @xcite based on the saturation model , the fss model  @xcite with and without saturation and the df model  @xcite .",
    "the soft to hard transition can be observed looking at the w - dependence of the vms photoproduction ( @xmath17 ) , where the scale is provided by @xmath5",
    ". figure  [ w_php ] collects the @xmath18 as a function of @xmath8 from the lightest vector meson , @xmath16 , to the heaviest , @xmath19 , compared to the total cross section .",
    "dependence of the cross section for exclusive vm photoproduction together with the total photoproduction cross section .",
    "lines are the result of a @xmath20 fit to the data at high @xmath8-energy values .",
    "[ w_php],scaledwidth=55.0% ]    the cross section rises with the energy as @xmath20 , where the @xmath21 exponent increases with the hard scale @xmath5 as expected for a transition from the soft to the hard regime . new results on the @xmath19 photoproduction  @xcite , recently published by zeus , confirmed the steeper rise of @xmath22 for higher vector meson masses .",
    "the transition from the soft to the hard regime can also be studied varying @xmath4 .",
    "recent results were achieved by h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite for the exclusive production of a real photon , the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , where the hard scale is provided only by the photon virtuality , @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ w_dvcs ] shows the h1 ( left ) and the zeus ( right ) results .",
    "a similar result was obtained for the @xmath13 electroproduction  @xcite .    [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]",
    "interest in diffraction at the lhc has been greatly boosted recently by theoretical predictions  @xcite that identified central exclusive production ( cep ) as a potential discovery channel for the higgs boson . in the last years",
    ", both atlas and cms have set up forward physics programs .",
    "both experiments have zero degree calorimeters with acceptance for neutral particles for @xmath23 .",
    "apart from those , their forward instrumentation is quite complementary .",
    "atlas is equipped with a dedicated luminosity system consisting of alfa , roman - pot housed tracking detectors at 240 m from the interaction point ( i.p . ) , which will peform an absolute luminosity measurement in runs with special lhc optics , and of lucid , cherenkov detectors ( @xmath24 ) for the primary purpose of luminosity monitoring during routine lhc data taking . at the cms i.p .",
    ", the task of an absolute luminosity determination will be carried out by an independent experiment , totem , with roman - pot housed silicon detectors at 220 m distance from the i.p .",
    "and two tracking telescopes inside of the cms volume .",
    "cms in addition has the castor calorimeter which extends the cms calorimetric coverage to rapidity values of 6.5 .",
    "castor gives access to the qcd parton evolution dynamics at very low-@xmath2 .",
    "in addition , fp420 , a joint r&d program of atlas , cms and the lhc machine group has investigated the feasibility of an upgrade of the forward detector instrumentation to make possible the direct observation of the scattered protons in cep of a higgs boson .",
    "a simple factorized regge - pole model  @xcite for the description of the dvcs amplitude was suggested and successfully tested over the hera data .",
    "the authors are now working to include in the analysis the vms production by using and extending the main ideas of the model .",
    "it follows from perturbative qcd that asymptotically the pomeron is an infinite sum of poles .",
    "this result is far from practical realization , however in minimal version , it is legitimate to assume that the pomeron is a sum of two regge poles @xmath25 where the subscripts allude that the first term is  soft \" , with @xmath26 and the second one is  hard \" , with @xmath27 these numbers coming from the fits to soft hadronic and hard deep inelastic reactions .",
    "such a two - component pomeron was first suggested by landshoff @xcite and it accounts for both soft and hard processes in the framework of a universal @xmath4-independent pomeron , which implies that the trajectories @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the same in all reactions , differing only by their weights , determined by the residue functions @xmath30 . according to arguments  @xcite based on unitarity , @xmath31 is progressively damped more that @xmath32 with increasing @xmath6 hence the hard term is masked at low @xmath4 ( soft reactions ) while it dominates at high @xmath4 .        in the model",
    "the two ( soft and hard ) terms have identical functional form , differing only by the parameters of two trajectories , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this is a universal pomeron in the sense , that its trajectories are the same in any ( soft or hard ) process , varying only the relative weight of the two terms @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]                      l. l. frankfurt , a. freund and m. strikman , _ phys .",
