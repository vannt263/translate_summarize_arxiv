    "in 1988 , a new approach to the relativistic dynamics appeared . by an appropriate conformal ( 3 + 1 ) splitting of the schwarzschild spacetime ,",
    "the so - called optical reference geometry was defined @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that this geometry enables us to define the inertial forces in the framework of general relativity , providing a description of test particle motion in accordance with our newtonian intuition @xcite , @xcite .",
    "later , the definition of the optical reference geometry and related inertial forces was generalized , extending its applicability to any spacetime @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the optical reference geometry was also thoroughly studied in particular spacetimes , such as schwarzschild - de sitter @xcite , @xcite , reissner - nordstrm @xcite , reissner - nordstrm - de sitter @xcite , kerr @xcite , @xcite or kerr - newman @xcite , illustrated by embedding diagrams @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the inertial forces formalism was applied for solving specific problems in relativistic dynamics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "behaviour of the centrifugal force is closely related to the shape of embedding diagrams of the optical geometry , therefore many properties of the relativistic dynamics in the spacetimes were effectively illustrated and directly visualized .    in the present work we extend our previous studies @xcite , @xcite to the case of the stationary and axially symmetric kerr - de sitter ( kds ) spacetimes , reflecting thus their basic properties incorporating a combined influence of the rotation of source and the cosmic repulsion , recently indicated by wide range of cosmological tests .",
    "it is worth to stress that the kds black - hole spacetimes could be important in understanding astrophysical phenomena exposed around supermassive black holes in giant active galactic nuclei as demonstrated in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we show that the application of the inertial forces concept proves to be very effective and provides simpler and intuitive approach to some relativistic problems , as compared to the standard general relativistic methods .",
    "the standard methods based on the covariant formulation of physical laws in a given background ( geodesic equation , energy momentum conservation , etc . ) can be then replaced by the well developed methods familiar from newtonian physics when inertial forces related to the optical geometry are used , making a significant technical simplification in treating physical processes in curved backgrounds and enabling their interpretation in the newtonian way .",
    "thus the present paper could be also considered to be an introduction in developing a new approach to study astrophysical phenomena .",
    "we give some explicit examples how the analysis of the inertial forces could immediately and in a very simple way make an enlightenment of the properties of the circular motion of test particles and perfect fluid .",
    "the structure of the paper is similar to the previous study of the optical geometry of the kerr - newman spacetimes @xcite , whereas the content is more extensive , mainly in the parts concerning the inertial forces application in the relativistic dynamics .",
    ", we briefly present basic general definitions of the optical geometry and inertial forces , focusing on the stationary and axially symmetric spacetimes and circular motion .",
    ", kds geometry is introduced .",
    "although the properties of the kds spacetimes are well known , we briefly discuss them here again , in order to simply demonstrate the so - called chinese boxes method , used later in much more complicated cases for discussions of the properties of the inertial forces and embedding diagrams .",
    ", the inertial forces in the kds spacetimes are determined for general circular motion , and their properties are briefly discussed and thoroughly represented for the equatorial circular motion . , some examples of the relativistic dynamics are shown from the point of view of the inertial forces formalism .",
    "there are many interesting relativistic problems , which can be simply investigated by using the inertial forces formalism .",
    "we present such problems that have been studied by the standard general relativistic methods as well , in order to show immediately the effectiveness and simplicity of the inertial forces approach .",
    "namely the equatorial circular motion is studied , simply providing important findings for the test particle and photon circular motion @xcite , equatorial static radius and static equilibrium positions of test particles on the axis of symmetry @xcite .",
    "another astrophysically relevant application of the inertial forces formalism is demonstrated in deducing projection of the relativistic euler equation that allows determination of the perfect fluid equilibrium toroidal configurations @xcite . , the embedding diagrams of the equatorial plane of the optical reference geometry of kds spacetimes are discussed and constructed .",
    "the whole optical geometry can not be embeddable , therefore we discuss limits of embeddability .",
    "we establish relations between the shape of the embedding diagrams and the behaviour of the centrifugal force , investigating turning points of the diagrams . finally , the embeddability of photon circular orbits is discussed and typical embedding diagrams are constructed .",
    ", we summarize results of our investigation of the optical reference geometry formalism in the kds spacetimes , and compare them with results obtained for previously studied backgrounds .",
    "in stationary spacetimes described by a metric @xmath0 ( with signature + 2 ) , the definition of the optical reference geometry requires an introduction of family of special observers with a timelike , unit , and hypersurface orthogonal field @xmath1 and with its field equal to the gradient of a scalar function , i.e. , @xcite @xmath2}=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such a vector field can be chosen in the form @xmath3 whereas it corresponds to the unit field of stationary observers parallel to a timelike vector field @xmath4 .",
    "then the local instantaneous space of the observers is described by the metric @xmath5 the so - called _ directly projected geometry_. its conformally adjusted metric @xmath6 is the so - called _ optical reference geometry_.    the @xmath7 of a test particle with a rest mass @xmath8 can be decomposed in the reference frame of the special observers with the @xmath1 by using the relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the unit spacelike vector parallel to the @xmath11 of the particle in the space and @xmath12 is the lorentz factor ( the speed of light @xmath13 ) .",
    "moreover , there is @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a projection tensor .",
    "note that the vector @xmath10 is defined only along the world line of the particle .",
    "but in our construction , it is necessary to know how @xmath10 changes along @xmath1 .",
    "this can be done in several different ways ( different gauges ) .",
    "the gauge used by m. abramowicz and his co - workers assures that the lie derivation of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath17 vanishes , i.e. , @xmath18 , which causes that the coriolis force defined below vanishes in static spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 of the particle can be written in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 . by using the spacelike unit vector parallel to @xmath10 in the optical reference geometry , i.e. , the vector @xmath22 , its covariant form @xmath23 , the scalar @xmath24 , identity @xmath25 and condition of hypersurface orthogonality",
    ", the projection of the into the space can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "now , the inertial force in the space @xmath29 , related to the real force by the equation @xmath30 , can be decomposed into the sum of the gravitational @xmath31 , centrifugal @xmath32 , coriolis @xmath33 and euler @xmath34 forces familiar from the newtonian physics , i.e. , @xmath35 where @xmath36 note that in the context of the optical reference geometry approach , the gravitational force ranks among the inertial forces .      in static and spherically symmetric spacetimes , the field ( [ 3 ] ) can be chosen with the vector being the timelike killing vector field @xmath37 , which is orthogonal to the spacelike azimuthal killing vector field @xmath38 . however , in stationary and axially symmetric spacetimes , the killing vector fields @xmath39 and @xmath40 are not orthogonal in general .",
    "thus the vector has to be chosen in order to satisfy the hypersurface orthogonality condition .",
    "it is easy to check that the vector field @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is hypersurface orthogonal and thus the field @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which corresponds to the field of the locally non - rotating frames moving along circular orbits with the angular velocity @xmath44 , defines the special observers @xcite .",

    "corresponding to the general circular motion of a test particle with an angular velocity @xmath46 , is not hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "moreover , the circular motion is directed along the killing vector @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath47 then , by using expressions ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 31 ] ) , the lorentz factor and velocity are given by the relations @xmath48 and components of the inertial forces ( [ 13])-([16 ] ) are given by the relations @xmath49,\\\\ \\label{37 } c_k = m\\gamma^2v\\,(\\xi^i\\xi_i)^{-3/2}e^{-\\phi}[\\xi^i\\xi_i\\nabla_{k}{(\\eta^i\\xi_i)}-\\eta^i\\xi_i\\nabla_k{(\\xi^i\\xi_i)}],\\\\ \\label{38 } e_k = m\\,e^{\\phi}\\gamma^3 u^i\\nabla_i(v ) \\tilde{\\tau}_k.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the newtonian character of the inertial forces formalism appears after introducing the quantities @xmath50 where @xmath51 is angular velocity relative to the lnrf",
    ". then we can write @xmath52 and the inertial forces ( [ 35])-([38 ] ) can be rewritten to the form @xmath53 the quantity @xmath54 corresponds to the so - called radius of gyration , defined by the relation @xmath55 generalizing in a special way its definition introduced and discussed for the static schwarzschild spacetimes in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath56 is the conserved specific angular momentum and @xmath57 is a scalar called pseudo - energy of the particle .",
    "since the vector field @xmath4 is not a killing vector field , such pseudo - energy is not conserved in general stationary and axially symmetric spacetimes .",
    "of course , in the static spacetimes , @xmath58 is conserved , being defined in the standard way as @xmath59 .",
    "the radius of gyration plays an important role in the theory of rotational effects in strong gravitational fields .",
    "the direction of increasing radius of gyration gives a preferred determination of the local outward direction relevant for the dynamical effects of rotation , whereas the direction becomes misaligned with the global outward direction in strong fields @xcite .",

    "equivalently , also the coordinates @xmath69 , @xmath70 , the line element @xmath71 , and the parameter @xmath65 are expressed in units of @xmath64 and become dimensionless .    the kds spacetimes , being stationary and axially symmetric , admit both the killing vector fields @xmath39 and @xmath40 , whereas @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the only intrinsic singularity of the kds solution is the ring singularity in the equatorial plane and it is given by the relation @xmath75 .",
    "stationary regions of the spacetimes are determined by the relation @xmath76 and limited by the inner and outer black - hole horizons at @xmath77 and @xmath78 and by the cosmological horizon at @xmath79 , which are real roots of the equation @xmath80",
    ". then spacetimes containing three horizons are black - hole spacetimes , while spacetimes containing one horizon ( the cosmological horizon exists for any choice of the spacetime parameters ) are naked - singularity spacetimes . spacetimes with two horizons are extreme black - hole or extreme naked - singularity spacetimes @xcite .    in order to obtain the number of horizons in dependence on the rotational and cosmological parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    ", we use the chinese boxes technique that will be used later in more complex discussions of the properties of the inertial forces and embedding diagrams . in the kds spacetimes , functions of the radius and two spacetime parameters",
    "are usually considered , and the routine is realized in two steps . a property of a function can be examined by investigation of properties of another function of the radius and of the lower number of parameters , i.e. , of the only spacetime parameter .",
    "these properties of the function can be examined by investigation of properties of other functions , but now , functions of the radius only .",
    "thus the properties of these functions can be determined by using a common way of investigation of functions dependent on one variable .",
    "finally , the kds spacetimes can be classified according to the initial property of the initial function .    in this case",
    ", it follows from the relation @xmath80 that for given @xmath81 and @xmath83 ( repulsive cosmological constant ) , the loci of horizons are given by solutions of the equation @xmath84 the reality condition @xmath85 can be then rewritten in the form @xmath86 the asymptotic behaviour of the function @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "assuming a test particle circular motion with the ( [ 31 ] ) at a fixed radius and latitude in the reference frame @xmath105 in the stationary and axially symmetric kds spacetimes , there are always zero time and azimuthal components of the gravitational , centrifugal and coriolis forces ( [ 35])-([37 ] ) , and zero radial and latitudinal components of the euler force ( [ 38 ] ) .",
    "the centrifugal , coriolis and euler forces vanish for @xmath106 and moreover , the euler force also vanishes in the case of the uniform motion @xmath107",
    ". however , due to the behaviour of the velocity independent parts of the forces , they can vanish ( and change their sign ) at some radii and latitudes independently of the velocity .",
    "the same can happen for the gravitational force which is velocity independent by definition .",
    "note that we pay no more attention to the euler force , because of its vanishing in the case of the uniform motion considered in the following .",

    "+   + both the presented parts of the investigation of optical reference geometry formalism and related classification of the kds spacetimes can be consider to be the basic and necessary study , before the formalism is applied in the dynamics .    by using some particular examples of the particle and fluid orbital motion , we have just directly demonstrated that the optical reference geometry and related inertial forces formalism presents certain , we can say pseudo - newtonian approach in relativistic dynamics .",
    "this approach is based on the newtonian way of dynamics description , but taking the general relativistic effects fully into account .",
    "now , we can state that the simplicity and applicability of the formalism , which were only predicted in a general way in some papers ( e.g. @xcite ) or directly shown , but only for the simpler types of spacetimes , survive even in the complex types of the kds spacetimes , where its application is then more useful all the more just because of the complexity of the spacetimes .    in spite of the more or less technical aspect of the paper",
    ", the study can be reviewed from the astrophysical point of view as well .",
    "we have shown that the combined effect of rotation and cosmic repulsion is relevant in both the cases of black - hole and naked - singularity backgrounds .",
    "clearly , choosing a characteristic type of motion and knowing the related behaviour of the forces , we can understand the influence of the rotational and cosmic parameters .",
    "of course , there are many astrophysical and conceptual reasons to choose the circular motion , as we have done . among others , comparing the results for the kerr and kds spacetimes ,",
    "the additional radius in the kds spacetimes , where the gravitational force vanishes , the same number of circular orbits where the centrifugal force vanishes and qualitatively same types of behaviour of embedding diagrams suggest that the influence of the cosmological constant is fundamentally imprinted mainly in the gravitational force .",
    "note that it was predicted in @xcite , by comparing the behaviour of the gravitational force in the sds and schwarzschild spacetimes ( see tables  [ tab:5 ] and [ tab:6 ] ) .",
    "one of the important new results concerns properties of the so - called static radii , where the gravitational attraction of a black hole ( naked singularity ) is just balanced by the cosmic repulsion .",
    "we have found that in the equatorial plane the location of the static radius @xmath249 is independent of the rotational parameter @xmath65 , and formally coincides with the results from the sds black - hole spacetimes , while on the axis of symmetry it depends on @xmath65 .",
    "physically , it is important that these results are easily implied by the analysis of the behaviour of the inertial forces .    from the physical point of view",
    ", the most important new result is given by the possibility to derive the euler equation easily in the framework of optical geometry and related inertial forces as shown in section 3 .",
    "it enables us to treat behaviour of perfect fluid orbiting black holes , and in general all the accretion processes , in the pseudo - newtonian way related to the inertial forces .",
    "we believe the pseudo - newtonian approach could be useful in modelling self - graviting discs around sds and kds black - holes . it should be noticed in this connection that character of the centrifugal force , which is relevant in determining the structure of thick discs , is clearly reflected by the embedding diagrams of the optical geometry ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus we can state , we dispose an alternative method to the standard general relativistic approach , practically and intuitively applicable in the kds spacetimes , and hence suitable for the description of astrophysical phenomena around supermassive black holes in centre of giant active galactic nuclei .",
