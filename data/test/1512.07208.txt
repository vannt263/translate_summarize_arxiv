    "there is a long tradition in statistics in predicting many aspects of athletic events , in particular which teams will win , which players are the best , and the propensity of players to become injured .",
    "the tradition began in baseball , and was glorified in _",
    "@xcite , but it has now extended to almost all other major sports . with the growing popularity of sports gambling and `` fantasy '' sites , there is more demand than ever for statistical information about which players will succeed and which teams will win .    this paper uses a simple , weighted , and penalized regression model ( see @xcite ) to predict the outcome of mlb , nba , nfl , and nhl games , using data going back more than thirty years scraped from the websites @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it is similar to the model in @xcite , except it measures the ability of teams over games instead of players over possessions , and it does not take into account which team is at home .",
    "we intentionally limit our data use to the date , home and visiting teams , and score of each game , and we compare our predictions to a theoretically near - optimal indicator .",
    "doing so tells us what statistical information is contained just in the scores , and whether what are commonly referred to as `` statistics '' have real predictive power . in basketball , the statistics are largely made unnecessary by the record of game scores , whereas in football this is clearly not the case .",
    "baseball and hockey lie somewhere in the middle .",
    "this is likely because basketball has long seasons and high - scoring games , whereas baseball and hockey have long seasons but low - scoring games .",
    "football has short seasons and is effectively `` low - scoring , '' because what matters is the number of scores that take place , not the scores point values .",
    "the models are trained on even - numbered years and tested on odd - numbered years .",
    "the theoretically near - optimal indicator works as follows : since our data is historical , we can predict every game by looking at the eventual end - of - season rankings and always bet that the eventually higher - ranked team will win .",
    "this estimator does not adjust for schedule difficulty , but is nonetheless very hard to beat .",
    "we demonstrate the performance of our penalized regression compared to this estimator . furthermore",
    ", we show how it can be computed quickly using the woodbury matrix identity .",
    "we additionally prove that our model beats a `` straw man . '' to compute the straw man prediction of a game , look at the previous season s ranking and predict that the higher ranking team will win .",
    "our model almost always beats the straw man .",
