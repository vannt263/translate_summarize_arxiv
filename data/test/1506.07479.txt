    "position - dependent effective masses have been widely used @xcite in compositionally graded crystals , semiconductor theory , quantum dots , quantum liquids , liquid crystals and metal clusters . in this paper",
    "we consider the use of a position - dependent effective mass in the structure of atomic nuclei , showing that this is not a mathematical trick introducing an extra parameter , but a necessity arising from concrete physical requirements .",
    "collective effects in atomic nuclei are described in two alternative frameworks , the collective model of bohr and mottelson @xcite and the interacting boson model ( ibm ) of arima and iachello @xcite",
    ". a major drawback of the collective model of bohr and mottelson has been over the years the rapid increase of the nuclear moments of inertia as a function of the nuclear deformation @xcite . a possible solution to this problem",
    "has been suggested @xcite recently by allowing the nuclear mass to depend on the deformation , taking advantage of techniques developed for hamiltonians with masses dependent on the coordinates @xcite , with exact analytical solutions obtained for certain classes of potentials through the use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susyqm ) @xcite .",
    "such a solution has been obtained @xcite for the deformation - dependent mass ( ddm ) bohr hamiltonian @xcite with a davidson potential @xcite , in which the mass depends on the deformation through a specific function containing a free parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to examine the physical relevance of this free parameter",
    ". this will be achieved by embedding @xcite the 5-dimensional ( 5d ) space of the bohr hamiltonian into a 6-dimensional ( 6d ) space , thus connecting the ddm free parameter to the curvature of the 5d space , a procedure of general applicability in hamiltonians using position - dependent masses .    on the other hand , the algebraic interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite , which is known to possess an overall u(6 ) symmetry in a 6d space ,",

    "in order to clarify the notions of curved space , embedding into higher dimensions , and conformal factor , we start with some simple considerations .",
    "the surface of a sphere is a 2d ( two - dimensional ) curved space of constant curvature , on which the pythagorean theorem is not valid .",
    "the pythagorean theorem is restored if we add one more dimension , going to the familiar 3d space , i.e. , embedding the 2d sphere in a ( 2 + 1)d space , in which the sphere is described by the constraint @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radius of the sphere , while the length element in cartesian coordinates is @xmath35 using eq .",
    "( [ x3 ] ) we can eliminate the 3rd coordinate , obtaining @xmath36 replacing the cartesian coordinates of the 2d euclidean space by polar ones @xmath37 this can be rewritten as @xmath38 performing the conformal transformation ( i.e. , a transformation not affecting the angles , but only modifying the radial coordinate ) @xmath39 the length element takes the form @xmath40 which is proportional to the euclidean expression @xmath41 differing only by the conformal factor in front of it in eq .",
    "( [ lconf2 ] ) .",
    "following the same steps in the embedding from three into four dimensions @xcite and using spherical coordinates one obtains @xmath42 which is proportional to the euclidean expression @xmath43      through a stereographic projection a point @xmath44 on the surface of a sphere is projected onto a point @xmath45 on the plane passing through the south pole of the sphere and being perpendicular to the axis connecting the poles of the sphere .",
    "the projection is made through a line starting from the north pole of the sphere , passing through the @xmath44 point and ending at the @xmath45 point .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in fig .  1 , where the plane formed by the axes 2 and 3 is depicted .",

( [ x3 ] ) for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath46 we find @xmath50 using cylindrical coordinates for the point on the sphere @xmath51 and polar coordinates on the plane passing through the south pole @xmath52 it turns out that @xmath53 the expression for @xmath54 coincides with the one given in eq .",
    "( [ rconf ] ) .",
    "we therefore see that the conformal factor can be seen as coming from a stereographic projection of a point on the surface of a 3d sphere onto a 2d plane tangent to it at its south pole .",
