    "another example of artificial self - propelled particles are granular hoppers that transform vertical vibration energy into directed horizontal motion @xcite .    on the biological side , the conversion of chemical energy into directed motion allows bacteria to individually search for food @xcite or to swim towards or away from illuminating light @xcite .",

    "the effect of self - propulsion enters through the last term on the right - hand side via the magnitude of the active drive @xmath0 .",
    "our next step is to derive dynamical equations for the particle density and for the polar orientational order of the self - propulsion directions .",

    "the elastic interactions guided the particles to find a global mode of migration , even under the influence of moderate stochastic noise . in this way , elasticity enforced global collective motion . due to the finiteness of the system sizes it is difficult , however , to make a rigid statement about what happens on very large length scales on the basis of the particle simulations .",
