    "( 2011 ) are unlikely to contribute to the flattening of the radio spectral indices of these snrs .",

    "radio spectral indices are usually less than around @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "finally , for a completeness of this summary , it should be noted that among the galactic and some large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) snrs , existence of significant spectral break and steepening at higher radio frequencies were also observed ( crawford et al .",
    "2008 ; xiao et al .",
    "2008 ; bozzetto et al .",
    "2010 ; de horta et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the best example is the radio continuum spectrum of galactic snr g180.0 - 1.7 ( s147 ) for which the spectral break is around 1.5 ghz , with low - frequency spectral index around 0.3 and high - frequency spectral index around 1.20 ( xiao et al .",
    "the compression of the local magnetic field and shift of the turn - over in the galactic radio spectrum to higher frequencies is one of the possible explanation of this kind of spectrum . on the other hand , synchrotron losses during the early phase of the snr",
    "would cause a bend at a rather high frequency , but subsequent expansion of the snr would shift the frequency toward about 1.5 ghz ( xiao et al .",
    "some of the models that try to explain `` concave down '' spectra of some galactic and extragalactic objects ( including synchrotron losses as well as finite emission region ) are presented in the following papers : bregman ( 1985 ) , biermann & strittmatter ( 1987 ) , heavens & meiseheimer ( 1987 ) .",
    "it is very difficult to derive accurate integrated flux densities .",
    "the small number of data points ( with associated errors ) and the dispersion of flux densities at the same frequencies pose a practical problem in determining the ( integrated ) radio spectral index and , generally , the shape of radio continuum . in that sense , it should be noted that present knowledge of radio spectral indices as well as of the overall shape of the galactic snr radio continuum spectra is far from being precise ( at least for the majority of galactic snrs ) .",
    "new observations usually lead to non - negligible changes in the measured spectral indices .",
    "for example , although for some mixed - morphology snrs greens s catalog @xcite gives rather steep spectral index , new observations given in @xcite and @xcite give slightly flatter , but still steep ( @xmath6 ) spectra ( e.g. for g53.6 - 2.2 , @xmath14 ; g93.7 - 0.2 , @xmath15 ; g116.9 + 0.2 , @xmath16 ; g160.9 + 2.6 , @xmath17 ) . in this paper",
    "are considered only those snrs for which the flux densities are on the scale of @xcite and have known errors @xmath18 .",
    "snrs with only four or less data points are not discussed in this paper .",
    "table 1 shows the list of several galactic snrs , with well defined radio spectra in the sense of previously mentioned criteria , and their basic properties : type , integrated radio spectral index @xmath5 , presence of low - frequency turn - over in overall spectrum ( t.o . ) , distance @xmath19 , mean diameter @xmath20 , approximate age @xmath21 , association / interaction with molecular cloud ( mc ) , and detection in @xmath2-rays ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the question of nature of the flat spectral indices in some galactic snrs is , in fact , still open . in sections 2",
    " 4 a brief revision of proposed explanations ( with the strongest arguments in their favor ) is presented .",
    "section 4 also deals with high energy properties of the snrs with flat radio spectra focusing on their detection in @xmath2-rays with the large area telescope onboard fermi @xmath2-ray space telescope ( _ fermi _ lat ) . in section 5 , model which includes significant intrinsic thermal bremsstrahlung radiation is discussed .",
    "finally , section 6 concludes the paper .",
    "although fermi i ( dsa ) is generally believed to be a primary mechanism for particle acceleration in snrs , fermi ii ( stochastic acceleration , see liu et al .",
    "2008 for details ) process in the shock turbulent vicinity could also be significant in some cases .",
    "@xcite used results of drge et al .",
    "( 1987 ) who solved the steady - state transport equation for the volume - integrated phase space distribution function of relativistic electrons in the vicinity of a plane - parallel shock wave allowing simultaneously for energy gain by multiple shock crossing and by second - order fermi momentum diffusion upstream and downstream of the shock .",
    "they concluded that the observed dispersion in spectral index values below @xmath22 is attributed to a distribution of low upstream plasma @xmath23 values for different snrs .",
    "plasma @xmath23 is defined as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gas pressure , @xmath26 the magnetic pressure , @xmath27 the magnetic induction , @xmath28 the number density , @xmath29 the boltzmann constant , @xmath30 and @xmath31 the electron and ion temperatures ( if different , or just temperature @xmath32 of the medium ) , @xmath33 the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath34 the alfv@xmath35n speed and @xmath2 the adiabatic index .",
    "for example , temperatures of around @xmath36 k ( @xmath37 1 ev ) and number densities of around @xmath38 lead to the plasma @xmath23 of 0.16 for the average value of galactic magnetic field ( magnetic induction ) of around @xmath39 .",
    "higher densities ( as well as higher temperatures ) would rise the plasma @xmath23 .",
    "also , higher magnetic fields will result in lower values of plasma @xmath23 for the same set of temperatures and densities .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that values of @xmath40 are sufficient to yield @xmath41 for shock compression ratios higher than ( or equal ) 2.5 ( assuming , also , constant spatial diffusion coefficient ; see equations 6 and 7 in schlickeiser & frst 1989 ) .    on the other hand , in their work ,",
    "they did not account for the possibility of compression ratios higher than 4 that could be expected in some ( evolutionary ) older snrs ( spectral index becomes 0.5 for compression ratio of 4 independently of plasma @xmath23 ) .",
    "drge et al .",
    "( 1987 ) emphasized that the flat spectra could be obtained for compression ratios that tend to the value of 4 if the spatial diffusion coefficient increases with momentum and @xmath42 .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath42 plasma and constant spatial diffusion coefficient , flat spectral indices are obtained for compression ratios higher than 4 ( which is not discussed in drge et al .",
    "adiabatic index is assumed to be @xmath43 in all the relevant equations .",
    "@xcite discussed the particle acceleration process at a ( parallel ) shock wave , in the presence of the second - order fermi acceleration in the turbulent medium near the shock , as an alternative explanation for the observed flat radio spectra of some galactic snrs in molecular clouds .",
    "he found that even very weak shocks may produce very flat cosmic - ray particle spectra in the presence of momentum diffusion ( using power - law form for the spatial diffusion coefficient ",
    "@xmath44 , assuming shock compression ratio of 4 and applying an effective jump condition for the alfv@xmath35n velocity ",
    "@xmath45 , where indices 1 and 2 refer to the upstream and downstream of the shock , respectively ) .",
    "ostrowski ( 1999 ) pointed out that as a consequence , the dependence of the particle spectral index of the shock compression ratio can be weaker than that predicted for the case of pure first - order acceleration .",
    "his analysis was based on the model of ostrowski & schlickeiser ( 1993 ) that improved the work of drge et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and @xcite deriving a simplified kinetic equation in the momentum space valid for the case of small momentum diffusion and also allowing the description of stationary spectra at the shock .",
    "@xcite emphasized that shock waves with alfv@xmath35n speed non - negligible in comparison to the shock velocity are responsible for generating the flat particle distribution .",
    "he noted that for the ratio of alfv@xmath35n speed and shock velocity ( inverse of the so called alfv@xmath35n mach number , see equation 4 ) around 0.1 the second - order fermi process can substantially modify the energy spectrum of the particles accelerated at the shock and that the model holds for values of that ratio less than 0.2 .",
    "previously mentioned alfv@xmath35n mach number of a shock is determined by @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the shock velocity , @xmath34 is the alfv@xmath35n velocity and @xmath48 is the shock velocity in @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the ionized ambient gas number density in @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the local magnetic induction , just before the shock , measured in @xmath53 .",
    "alfv@xmath35n mach number is generally an important parameter as the ratio of acceleration rates of the fermi i ( dsa ) and fermi ii ( second - order ) processes scales as @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "as the bulk post - shock flow is expected to be super - alfv@xmath35nic it is logical to conclude that the dsa is more rapid process .",
    "the corresponding analysis was successfully applied to the snrs w44 and ic443 .",
    "although @xcite could not reproduce the steep spectral index ( 0.55 ) in the case of snr 3c391 , using the spectral index value of 0.49 @xcite , this model could be justified ( for shock velocity of around 300 km / s and inter - clump density of around @xmath55 , as in ostrowski 1999 , this model could account for observable spectral index of 0.49 if magnetic induction is @xmath56 ; see equations 2.6 - 2.9 from ostrowski 1999 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that compression ratios higher than 4 ( not discussed in ostrowski 1999 ) would give , in this model , lower magnetic induction estimates .",
    "it is worth noting that snrs expanding in molecular clouds mostly evolve in the clumpy medium .",
    "the dominant part of the cloud mass is contained in the compact dense clumps filling only around 10% or less of the cloud volume and the rest of the cloud is filled with inter - clump gas of average number density of @xmath55 ( chevalier 1999 ; ostrowski 1999 ) .",
    "however , one must bear in mind that snr precursors could contribute to modification of physical conditions in the immediate pre - shock ism ( arthur 2012 ) .",
    "the fact that many snrs with flat spectral indices are also connected with molecular cloud environment could be a sign that models like @xcite are more appropriate in these cases . as the radiative",
    "shock has been revealed by the _ spitzer _",
    "irs slit observation of snr 3c396 , that expands through the clumpy environment , model of ostrowski ( 1999 ) could possibly account for the observed flat radio spectral index ( hewitt et al .",

    "2011 ) . for inter - clump density of",
    "around @xmath57 and for shock velocities of 120 km / s and 350 km / s ( hewitt et al . 2009 ) , magnetic induction of @xmath58 is needed , respectively , to account for observable radio spectral index of 0.34 ( see equations 2.6 - 2.9 from ostrowski 1999 ) . for a blast wave velocity of 870 km / s ( su et al .",
    "2011 ) , needed value of magnetic induction is higher  around @xmath59 . in the case of snr w28 , for shock velocity of around 80 km / s and inter - clump density of around @xmath60 ( rho & borkowski 2002 ) , model of ostrowski ( 1999 ) could account for observable spectral index of 0.35 if magnetic induction is @xmath61 . for higher inter - clump density of @xmath55 ,",
    "needed magnetic induction would be around @xmath62 .",
    "finally , hb21 is known to be interacting with clumpy molecular clouds ( pannuti et al .",
    "2010 and references therein )",
    ". if we assume , approximately , 130 km / s for the velocity of radiative shell and the mean ambient density of @xmath63 ( koo et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) , model of ostrowski ( 1999 ) could account for observable radio spectral index of 0.36 if magnetic induction is @xmath64 . in all of these cases",
    "compression ratio of 4 was assumed .",
    "finally , it must be emphasized that there are several snrs , with flat spectral indices , that are generally associated with relatively lower densities such as g82.2 + 5.3 ( w63 ) , with @xmath65 ( higgs et al .",
    "1991 ; mavromatakis 2004 ; gao et al .",
    "2011 ) , and g166.0 + 4.3 ( vro 42.05.01 ) , with @xmath66 ( guo & burrows 1997 ; leahy & tian 2005 ; bocchino et al . 2009 ; gao et al .",
    "both snrs are classified as mixed - morphology ones .",
    "w63 is probably expanding in the wind blown bubble and vro 42.05.01 has probably broken out of the cloud within which it formed , expanded across an interstellar tunnel or cavity , and is now interacting with the material that forms the opposite tunnel wall ( pineault et al .",
    "1987 ; burrows & guo 1994 ; guo & burrows 1997 ; mavromatakis 2004 ) .",
    "if the model of @xcite is acceptable for these snrs , then the observed spectral indices lead to the plasma @xmath23 around 0.17 and 0.05 for w63 and g166.0 + 4.3 , respectively , in the case of compression ratio of 3.9 and constant spatial diffusion coefficient .",
    "slightly higher values of plasma @xmath23 are obtained for compression ratio of 2.5 .",
    "if power - law index of the spatial diffusion coefficient dependence of momentum equals 0.67 , then observed spectral indices could not be obtained by the model of drge et al .",
    "( 1987 ) . finally , if plasma @xmath42 than compression ratios of around 6.95 and 12.3 correspond to the observed spectral indices of w63 and g166.0 + 4.3 , respectively ( for constant spatial diffusion coefficient ) .",
    "these estimates will , on the other hand , lead to ( unrealistically ) low isothermal mach number , fully radiative snr shocks .",
    "the flatter spectra may also be due to compression ratios greater than four at fully radiative ( isothermal ) shocks ( in the post sedov - taylor phases of snr evolution ) . in the case of parallel isothermal shock , compression ratio @xmath8 is equal to a square of isothermal mach number ( @xmath67 ) so that test particle dsa gives : @xmath68 in figure 1 it is shown that this explanation , for observable flat spectral index range , @xmath69 , holds only for very low isothermal mach number fully radiative shocks ( isothermal mach numbers around 23 ) in the test - particle dsa .",
    "of course , one must bear in mind that the onset of the so called momentum - conserving snowplow phase occur only near the end of a snr lifetime , or not occur at all and even a pressure - driven snowplow model is just the asymptotic case @xcite . of course , local regions of the snr blast wave may leave the sedov - taylor phase earlier at those places where the ambient density is much higher than average , though the bulk evolution still corresponds to energy conserving phase @xcite .",
    "this means that different parts of an snr may be in different phases so that different shock velocities and compression ratios within the snr are possible , which could have repercussions on the integrated radio spectrum .",
    "it must be noted that the values of adiabatic index slightly less than @xmath43 ( due to high temperatures behind the shock front and/or because the molecules in the cloud , with which snr interacts , will cool more efficiently than the ambient medium or the ejecta as discussed in davis 2007 ) would reproduce some of the observable flat spectra in the case of parallel adiabatic shock wave and test - particle dsa ( see equation 2 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "such values are generally not expected in the post - shock medium .",
    "finally , anand ( 2012 ) derived and discussed the jump relations across a shock in non - ideal gas flow .",
    "it is interesting to note that even for very small non - idealness of gas , using equation ( 5 ) from anand ( 2012 ) , for the compression ratio , flat spectral indices are obtained for the large range of shock velocities in the framework of dsa .",
    "of course , applicability of the non - ideal gas equation of state in the case of the particular ism plasmas is questionable .",
    "since there is a significant connection between the majority of galactic snrs with flat integrated radio spectrum and their detection in @xmath2-rays , the high energy properties of these snrs are now discussed ( see table 1 ) .",
    "apart from historical ( e.g. tycho and cassiopeia a  abdo et al .  2010e ; giordano et al .  2012 ) and young tev - bright snrs ( e.g. rx j1713.7 - 3946 and vela jr .  abdo et al .  2011 ; tanaka et al .  2011 ) , among the snrs recently detected with _ fermi _",

    "@xmath2-ray emission from snrs can be produced by few different , non - exclusive , mechanisms .",

    "it must be noted that gev and tev @xmath2-rays outside the southern boundary of snr w28 may be explained by molecular clouds illuminated by runaway cosmic - rays ( uchiyama et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite also assumed pre - existing cosmic - rays in the cloud to have the same spectra as the galactic cosmic - rays in the vicinity of the solar system although the ambient cosmic - rays in the pre - shock cloud may deviate from the galactic pool due to the runaway cosmic - rays that have escaped from snr shocks at earlier epochs .",
    "another model by @xcite was also proposed assuming the possibility of electron acceleration by magnetohydrodynamical turbulence behind high density shocks ( vink 2012 ) . in their model",
    ", the calculated radio spectrum fits that observed from the snr ic443 shell because of the large shock compression ratio and to a lesser extent because of the effect of the second - order fermi acceleration .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this model involves a lepton scenario of @xmath2-ray emission from snrs interacting with molecular clouds .",
    "recently , it was shown that the observations over a very broad range of radio frequencies reveal a curvature in the spectra of some evolutionary older galactic snrs expanding in high density environment ( tian & leahy 2005 ; uroevi ' c & pannuti 2005 ; leahy & tian 2006 ; uroevi ' c , pannuti & leahy 2007 ; oni & uroevi 2008 ) .",
    "the ndsa effects could not be responsible for a characteristic shape of the integrated radio spectra in these cases .",
    "the presence of intrinsic thermal bremsstrahlung radiation was proposed as an explanation of the `` concave up '' radio spectrum ( uroevi ' c 2000 ; uroevi ' c et al . 2003ab ; oni et al . 2012 and references therein ) .",
    "presence of the cooled thermal x - ray electrons in post sedov - taylor snrs , higher ambient densities , interaction with or expansion in molecular cloud are main arguments used by the model that includes significant intrinsic thermal bremsstrahlung emission ( thermal model ) .",
    "detections of the low - frequency turn - overs , in the integrated radio spectrum , related with thermal absorption linked to snrs ( brogan et al . 2005 ; castelletti et al .",
    "2011 ) are important in justification of this model as one can then predict the significance of thermal emission at higher frequencies . generally , linear polarization measurements ( that give the upper limits for the thermal component of the radio emission ) , possible detections in @xmath70 as well as the observations of radio recombination lines associated with snrs should accompany this kind of analysis .",
    "it must be emphasized that most of the potential targets for testing the thermal model hypothesis fall in the mixed - morphology class of snrs . because of the fact that these snrs appear to be in the radiative phases of their evolution , with shock velocities less than 200 km / s ( vink 2012 ) , the ensemble of cooled thermal x - ray electrons could exist , supporting the thermal model @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent discovery of strong radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) , seen in the x - rays of several snrs of this type , represents definite evidence that their plasma is recombining ( yamaguchi et al .",
    "rrcs in their x - ray spectra are indicative of higher densities in interiors of these remnants ( vink 2012 ) .",
    "thus , mixed - morphology snrs are characterized by a more / less uniform high interior density with medium hot temperatures , rather than very high temperatures and very low interior densities , as in the case of typical shell remnants . also , among the snrs with detected rrc , the most of them ( if not all ) have flat radio spectral index ( sawada & koyama 2012 ; uchida et al .  2012 ; vink 2012 ) . finally , as it was emphasized earlier , the morphology of these snrs is difficult to explain with standard snr evolutionary phases @xcite and several models were proposed in the current literature ( white & long 1991 ; cox et al .",
    "an x - ray emitting overionized plasma is the result of an early heating followed by a rapid cooling , but the mechanism responsible for such processes in mixed - morphology snrs is still not completely understood ( miceli 2011 ) .",
    "@xcite have recently analyzed the integrated radio spectra of 3 snrs ( ic443 , 3c391 , 3c396 ) for which the thermal model could be a natural explanation .",
    "all of the 3 snrs are characterized by flat spectral indices ( see table 1 ) based on a simple power - law ( synchrotron ) fit and all of them interact with molecular clouds . for ic443 and",
    "3c391 the low - frequency turn - over is due to thermal absorption linked to the snrs and for snr 3c396 the nature of the observed low - frequency turn - over is not yet clear .",
    "it must be emphasized that most of the snrs that are the best targets for testing thermal model are also characterized by the flat spectral indices .",
    "the observed flat spectral indices could be just the apparent manifestation of the presence of thermal component .",
    "it must be noted that there are no predictions of curved  `` concave up '' integrated radio spectra in the cases of the explanations presented in sections 24 for the flat radio spectra seen in some snrs .",
    "the shock wave dissociates molecules , or raises the gas temperature so that previously inaccessible degrees of freedom become accessible .",
    "the compression ratio for the parallel shock wave , including the possibility of jump in adiabatic index , is as follows : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are adiabatic indices in upstream and downstream region , respectively . if @xmath74 ( diatomic molecules like @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 ( fully ionized gas ) it is easily seen that ( upstream ) adiabatic mach number @xmath77 leads to @xmath78 so that for weaker shocks the steeper spectra will be preferable .",
    "as the ambient gas is usually pre - ionized by radiative precursor , the similar conclusion ( for slightly smaller adiabatic mach numbers ) could be drawn from the simple relation for constant adiabatic index of @xmath43 ( described in section 1 using equation 2 , see figure 2 ) .",
    "this means that we expect that evolutionary old snrs , with velocities smaller than around @xmath79 , have steeper synchrotron spectral indices in the framework of test - particle dsa .",
    "this can partially account ( except high parameter uncertainties ) for steeper synchrotron spectral indices determined from the thermal plus non - thermal model fits @xcite .",
    "radio spectral index variations , both with frequency and location within several galactic snrs were detected ( frst & reich 1988 ; anderson & rudnic 1993 ; zhang et al .",
    "1997 ; leahy & roger 1998 ; leahy et al .",
    "1998 ; tian & leahy 2005 ; leahy 2006 ; ladouceur & pineault 2008 ) . in order to have spectral changes with position , physical conditions that alter",
    "the radio spectrum must change with position .",
    "of course , spatial radio spectral index variations are naturally expected in the case of composite snrs due to the presence of pulsar wind nebula .",
    "on the other hand , variations in @xmath5 are detected in both shell and mixed - morphology snrs .",
    "if the spectral index is changing with frequency , generally , there is a possibility that two different radiation mechanisms are producing the radio continuum emission .",
    "integrated radio spectrum with `` concave up '' curvature in the case of older snrs , where efficient ndsa process is not expected , can be produced by adding two different emission spectra along the same line of sight or within the same emitting volume ( leahy & roger 1998 ) .",
    "these kind of spectra could be due to different electron populations or because of the significant intrinsic thermal bremsstrahlung radiation @xcite .",
    "linear polarization measurements are of the great importance as spectral flattening associated with high density regions of an snr which do not show high linear polarization could be naturally explained by the thermal model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there are some other processes that could shape the integrated radio continuum at higher frequencies ( between 10 - 100 ghz ) in several galactic snrs , such as the spinning dust emission ( draine & lazarian 1998 ; scaife at al .",
    "the spinning dust model will be responsible for a creation of a `` hump '' in the high - frequency radio spectrum ( see figure 5 from scaife at al .",
    "of course , as it was emphasized it the section 1 , present knowledge on integrated radio spectrum is generally unsatisfactory for firm quantitative analysis of the proposed models so as to the contribution of dust emission .",
    "more data at radio frequencies higher than 1 ghz , e.g. those from atca ( the australia telescope compact array ) , are expected to shed a light on the existence of the so called `` radio thermally active '' snrs as well as on the issue of the flat spectral indices .",
    "it must be mentioned that there is a general problem in observing at the higher radio continuum frequencies ( @xmath8030 ghz ) due to atmospheric absorption issues .",
    "ground - based radio astronomy is limited to high altitude sites such as in the case of alma ( atacama large millimeter array ) .      except the supernova remnants",
    "g31.9 + 0.0 ( 3c391 ) , g39.2 - 0.3 ( 3c396 ) , g189.1 + 3.0 ( ic443 ) , analyzed in @xcite , that represent the best targets for justification of the thermal model , in this paper , the integrated radio spectra of snrs g6.4 - 0.1 ( w28 ) , g18.8 + 0.3 ( kes 67 ) , g34.7 - 0.4 ( w44 ) , g43.3 - 0.2 ( w49b ) , g89.0 + 4.7 ( hb21 ) , g94.0 + 1.0 ( 3c434.1 ) were also discussed .",
    "all of these snrs are associated with dense environment ( see table 1 ) .",
    "integrated flux densities are collected from the literature keeping in mind the criteria defined in section 1 .",
    "in the case of presence of spectral turn - over at low frequencies only data which are not influenced by the possible thermal absorption ( or maybe by synchrotron self - absorption ) were used in thermal model fits @xcite .",
    "simple sum of non - thermal and thermal components , represented by corresponding power - laws , ( see equation 18 and corresponding discussion in oni et al . 2012 ) is assumed . for frequencies in @xmath81",
    ", the relation for the integrated flux density can be written as follows : @xmath82,\\ ] ] where : @xmath83 and @xmath84 are flux densities corresponding to thermal and non - thermal components , respectively .",
    "weighted least squares fit ( influenced by the instrumental errors ) were applied . in the case of all of these six snrs thermal model fit is either not significant ( contribution of the thermal component at 1 ghz is near zero ) or the fit quality is not satisfactory ( and associated parameter errors exceed values of the corespondent parameters ) .",
    "pure non - thermal fit parameters for these snrs correspond to ones given in the present literature ( see table 1 ) .    in the case of snr w28 ,",
    "low - frequency spectral turn - over in the integrated spectrum is possible as flux density at 30.9 mhz has a rather low value in the sense of scatter from the power - law fit ( see figure 5 in dubner et al .",
    "the associated error for that flux density is 20% ( kassim 1989 ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is a great spread in flux density values , especially at 2.7 ghz , which prevents firm conclusions .",
    "the great spread in the integrated flux densities at the same frequencies is very good seen in the case of snrs w49b and w44 ( morsi & reich 1987 ; kassim 1989 ; taylor et al .",

    "2011 ) . for snr w44",
    "there is no apparent low - frequency spectral turn - over in the integrated radio spectrum , only the localized one , towards the southeast border of the snr , likely due to the free - free absorption from ionized gas in the post - shock region at the snr / molecular cloud interface ( castelletti et al .",
    "2007 ) . detected turn - over at lower frequencies for w49b is likely due to the extrinsic free - free absorption by an intervening cloud of thermal electrons ( lacey et al .",
    "there is no apparent low - frequency spectral turn - over in integrated spectra of snrs kes 67 , hb21 and 3c434.1 ( reich et al .",

    "in the case of other snrs that are listed in @xcite as those with flat spectral indices ( not plerions ) , expanding in high density environment , there are not enough data ( under criteria presented in section 1 ) for a detailed discussion .",
    "generally , there is a significant number of snrs listed in @xcite for which the spectral indices are determined only by two or three data points . some of the snrs that could be interesting targets for analysis , in future , when more reliable data at different frequencies are obtained , are g49.2 - 0.7 ( w51c ) and g290.1 - 0.8 ( msh 11 - 61a ) .",
    "a few words of caution regarding the justification of thermal model .",
    "snr s expansion in complex environment and possible association with regions ( and so possible thermal contamination ) makes the study more complicated .",
    "the best example is the case of steep radio spectrum snr g132.7 + 1.3 ( hb3 ) for which the intrinsic thermal radiation was dismissed due to the actual overlap between the snr and corespondent regions ( shi et al .",
    "2008 ) . of course",
    ", the question on the presence of significant thermal radio emission from snr hb3 , in fact , still remains open as the possible region radiation contamination can not rule out the possibility of thermal bremsstrahlung emission from the snr itself , it can just mask it .",
    "final conclusion is that our present knowledge on integrated flux densities prevents us from possibility of strong justification of the thermal model and limits the discussion to just a few galactic snrs analyzed in @xcite .",
    "a considerable fraction of galactic snrs are characterized by the flat spectral indices ( @xmath0 ) . in this paper ,",
    "known models are summarized and discussed :    1 .",
    "there are several explanations of the observable flat radio spectra of some snrs .",
    "most of the models involve a significant contribution of second - order fermi mechanism , but some of them discuss higher shock compressions , contribution of secondary electrons / positrons left over from the decay of charged pions , as well as the possibility of thermal contamination .",
    "2 .   in the case of expansion in high density environment",
    ", thermal bremsstrahlung could theoretically shape the spectrum of snrs .",
    "lack of more high quality data constraints the discussion only to several snrs . on the other hand",
    ", this model can naturally account to observable curved  `` concave up '' radio spectra of some galactic snrs .",
    "new observations are expected to create a clear picture about the high frequency range ( 1 - 100 ghz ) of the radio continuum , as well as about the question of the significant contribution of intrinsic thermal bremsstrahlung radiation . with instruments like the jvla and atca , it should be far easier to measure the spectral indices in individual observations . 3 .",
    "the fundamental question about the origin of flat spectral indices still remains open .",
    "the more realistic picture would involve the action of more than one of the mentioned processes , in which some of them could be more or less prominent depending on the particular setup .",
    "since there is a significant connection between the majority of galactic snrs with flat integrated radio spectra and their detection in @xmath2-rays , as well as detection of rrc in their x - ray spectra , the analysis of high energy properties of these snrs will be potentially very important .",

    "<S> a considerable fraction of galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) characterize flat spectral indices ( @xmath0 ) </S>",
    "<S> . there are several explanations of the flat radio spectra of snrs in the present literature . </S>",
    "<S> the most of models involve a significant contribution of the second - order fermi mechanism but some of them also discuss high compressions ( @xmath1 ) , contribution of secondary electrons left over from the decay of charged pions , as well as the possibility of thermal contamination . in the case of expansion in high density environment , intrinsic thermal bremsstrahlung could theoretically shape the radio spectrum of an snr and also account for observable curved  `` concave up '' radio spectra of some galactic snrs . this model could also shed a light on the question of flat spectral indices determined in some galactic snrs . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , present knowledge of the radio continuum spectra ( integrated flux densities at different frequencies ) of snrs prevent definite conclusions about the significance of proposed models so the question on flat spectral indices still remains open . </S>",
    "<S> new observations , especially at high radio continuum frequencies , are expected to solve these questions in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> finally , as there is a significant connection between the majority of galactic snrs with flat integrated radio spectrum and their detection in @xmath2-rays as well as detection of radiative recombination continua in their x - ray spectra , the analysis of high energy properties of these snrs is very important . </S>"
