    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have long been known to undergo dramatic and rapid variations in brightness @xcite .",
    "this variability is exploited with the technique of reverberation mapping @xcite to study the broad - line region ( blr ) of agns , a region of gas only @xmath3pc in size and presumed to be photoionized by the emission from an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole .",
    "spatially unresolvable even for the most nearby galaxies , the blr is studied in the time domain through monitoring the variable continuum emission ( presumably originating close to the black hole ) and its reprocessing in the blr gas , discernible as variations in the broad emission - line fluxes and profiles .    under the assumptions that ( 1 ) the continuum - emission region is much smaller than the blr , ( 2 )",
    "time delays arise predominantly from light - travel time , and ( 3 ) the relationship between the ionizing and observed continuum is smooth , a linearized echo model can be used to express changes in the emission lines ( @xmath4 ) as time - delayed responses to changes in the continuum ( @xmath5 ) : @xmath6    here , @xmath7 is the change in the emission - line flux at line - of - sight velocity @xmath8 and time @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the change in the continuum flux at time @xmath9 , and @xmath11 is the so - called transfer function , or velocity - delay map , giving the distribution of the line response over line - of - sight velocity @xmath8 and time delay @xmath12 ( i.e. , the emission - line response to a @xmath13-function continuum event ) .",
    "information on the blr geometry , kinematics , and ionization structure is encoded in @xmath11 , making recovery of velocity - delay maps a key goal of echo - mapping experiments .    due to the formidable requirements of long - duration monitoring , high temporal sampling , and high - quality and homogeneous data for recovery of velocity - delay maps @xcite",
    ", most echo - mapping experiments have restricted the analysis to a simpler problem : measuring the mean delay @xmath12 , and hence the mean radius @xmath14 of the blr , through cross - correlation of the line and continuum light curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "analyses comparing delays in different parts of the emission - line profiles , such as the red wing versus the blue wing ( e.g. , @xcite ) , have sometimes shown evidence of asymmetry , hinting at gross characteristics ( inflow vs. outflow vs. circulation ) of the blr gas flow .    for certain high - quality data sets , delay maps ( @xmath15 )",
    "have been recovered .",
    "these include delay maps for ly@xmath2 and , among other lines , derived from the _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( _ iue _ ) monitoring dataset for ngc5548 @xcite , and the delay maps recovered by @xcite from ground - based optical monitoring of h@xmath1 in ngc5548 .",
    "the delay maps generally agree with the results of cross - correlation analysis , while allowing additional insights into the details of the blr .",
    "@xcite find a lack of h@xmath1 response at zero time delay in ngc5548 , a signature of anisotropic ( inward ) h@xmath1 response and/or a paucity of blr gas near the line of sight .",
    "in addition to presenting delay maps for several ultraviolet lines in ngc4151 , @xcite also present a partially recovered velocity - delay map for , which unfortunately suffered from strong intrinsic absorption in the line core throughout the campaign .",
    "three separate groups attempted to recover velocity - delay maps from an _ iue _ and _ hubble space telescope _ monitoring campaign of ngc5548 ; however , these studies were again hampered by the quality of the data used , and the final conclusions ranged from no radial motion @xcite to some radial infall @xcite to radial outflow ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent results from the lick agn monitoring project ( lamp ; @xcite ) and from mdm observatory ( @xcite ) have shown that recovery of velocity - delay maps may be within the reach of current agn monitoring programs due to their monitoring baselines of several months , daily sampling , and homogeneous data with high signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) . in this _ letter _ , we present velocity - delay maps recovered with maximum - entropy techniques for six optical h and he recombination lines in the lamp spectra of arp151 ( mrk40 ) : h@xmath2 , h@xmath1 , h@xmath0 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we also suggest plausible models for the geometry and kinematics of the blr in arp151 that could account for the observed velocity - delay structure .",
    "details of the photometric light curves are presented by @xcite . in brief , broad - band johnson @xmath19 and @xmath20 images of arp151 were obtained at the 0.8-m tenagra ii telescope in southern arizona between 2008 february 27 and may 16 ( ut here and throughout ) .",
    "standard reduction techniques were employed , and photometric light curves were measured with differential photometry relative to field stars .",
    "absolute flux calibrations were determined using @xcite standard - star fields .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring of arp151 was carried out at the lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the kast dual spectrograph between 2008 march 25 and may 21 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the kast red - side ccd with the 600  lines  mm@xmath21 grating allowed spectral coverage over the range 43007100 .",
    "spectra were obtained at a fixed position angle of 90  through a 4-wide slit , with a typical s / n @xmath22 per pixel at rest - frame 5100 .",
    "flux calibrations were determined from nightly spectra of standard stars .",
    "small time - variable and wavelength - dependent corrections were made to the spectra to account for three types of systematic error : ( 1 ) wavelength shifts due to flexure and atmospheric differential refraction , ( 2 ) spectral blurring due to atmospheric seeing and instrumental resolution , and ( 3 ) photometric errors due to slit losses and atmospheric transmission ( see bentz et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation , for a detailed description of the methodology ) . after correcting for these errors ,",
    "the continuum - subtracted line - profile variations were subjected to echo - mapping analysis with memecho .",
    "memecho ( see @xcite for details ) uses a maximum - entropy technique to recover @xmath11 by fitting the linearized echo model of equation  ( [ eqn : echo ] ) to the observed continuum light curve and responding emission - line velocity profiles .",
    "memecho finds the `` simplest '' positive image @xmath23 that fits the data .",
    "the image @xmath23 includes an evenly sampled driving continuum light curve @xmath24 , a background spectrum @xmath25 representing nonvariable line emission , and the velocity - delay map @xmath11 .",
    "the quality of the fit to the @xmath26 data points is measured by @xmath27 summed over measurements of the driving continuum light curve and the reverberating emission - line spectrum .",
    "simplicity is measured by the entropy @xmath28 relative to a `` default image '' @xmath29 . since @xmath30 , maximum entropy at @xmath31 occurs when @xmath32 .",
    "our default image @xmath29 slightly blurs the image @xmath23 ( for example @xmath33 for a one - dimensional image ) , and thus @xmath34 increases toward 0 for smooth positive images . with suitable datasets",
    "memecho delivers a well - defined map maximizing @xmath34 for a specified @xmath35 .",
    "the resolution of the map and the quality of the fit improve as @xmath35 is reduced . when @xmath27 is set too low , the fit attempts to follow noise in the data , resulting in noisy maps .",
    "the maps we show are for @xmath36 , giving the highest resolution maps and the best fits we could achieve while avoiding the introduction of spurious structure , typically large excursions in the gaps between measurements of @xmath24 .",
    "we chose the @xmath19-band photometric light curve as the driving continuum light curve for the memecho analysis .",
    "the variations in @xmath19 are stronger than in @xmath20 with no evident time delay between the two @xcite , and the photometric light curves are more accurately calibrated than the spectroscopic continuum light curve , which suffers from aperture effects .",
    "furthermore , the contribution of the broad emission lines to the photometric variability is negligible ( see @xcite for a complete discussion ) .",
    "the @xmath20-band light curve and the integrated h@xmath2 , h@xmath1 , and @xmath37 light curves were then modeled as echoes of @xmath19 , as were the emission - line light curves at each wavelength .",
    "thus , we fit delay distributions simultaneously to a total of 1373 individual light curves  one per spectral pixel ( each with @xmath38 ) , plus the @xmath20-band and integrated balmer - line light curves .",
    "we enforce causality by requiring non - negative delays , @xmath39days .",
    "we set @xmath40days , which is @xmath41 of the spectroscopic monitoring baseline , and we use a uniform spacing of @xmath42day in the delay maps and continuum light curve .",
    "the linearized echo model gives a tangent - line approximation to what may in principle be nonlinear responses to changes @xmath43 away from a reference continuum level @xmath44 . for @xmath44",
    "we adopt the mean of the observed @xmath19-band fluxes .    in figure  1 , we show selected light curves of arp151 along with their memecho fits and recovered delay maps . the selected wavelengths sample the cores of the emission lines plus the balmer - line wings .",
    "the @xmath19-band ( driving ) light curve is shown in the bottom panel .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is reported for each light curve shown , and is 1.1 when summed over all light curves including those not shown .",
    "the delay maps at each wavelength are assembled into a velocity - delay map shown over the full spectral range in figure  2 and centered on the six strongest emission lines in figure  3 . to aid in comparing the velocity - delay structure of different emission lines , figure  4",
    "presents false - color maps with red , green , and blue colors giving the velocity - delay distributions of different emission lines as indicated .",
    "taken together , the velocity - delay maps exhibit a virial structure with the emission - line response covering a wider range of velocities at smaller delays .",
    "this is perhaps best seen in figures  3 and 4 , where the line responses are confined within the `` virial envelope '' @xmath45 for @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the balmer - line maps all have the same basic structure , with longer delays in the core and smaller delays in the line wings , and with the red - wing response much stronger than that of the blue wing .",
    "the h@xmath2 response is detected from 0 days in the red wing to about 15 days in the line core .",
    "the other balmer lines have a similar structure , but with h@xmath1 extending to about 7 days and h@xmath0 to 5 days .",
    "the mean delays from these maps are consistent with the mean lag times from the cross - correlation analysis presented by @xcite .",
    "a plausible interpretation of this effect is a radial stratification resulting from optical - depth effects within the balmer series @xcite .",
    "the response of the helium lines is consistent with zero time delay , except for some response at small positive delays in the map of @xmath16  and @xmath17 . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the helium response occurs on shorter timescales than our monitoring sampling and is therefore unresolved .",
    "the h@xmath2 map shows a `` curl '' at long time delays on the blue side of the line outside the virial envelope .",
    "this weak feature may be an artifact , as it does not always appear in maps made with slightly different fitting parameters .",
    "features that appear in all of the balmer lines , such as the strong emission in the red wings , are more secure .",
    "the maps show a lack of prompt response in the core of all three balmer lines .",
    "the delay map for the integrated h@xmath1 profile in figure  1 shows a paucity of response at zero lag , similar to what was found for ngc5548 @xcite , even though the full velocity - delay map clearly shows gas responding with zero lag in the red wing of h@xmath1 .",
    "we have examined the predicted velocity - delay structure for a variety of simple blr models to identify classes of models that fail and succeed in qualitatively reproducing the main features of the observed velocity - delay maps .",
    "two successful classes of models are represented by the freefall and disk  +  hotspot models shown in figure  5 .",
    "for all four models in figure  5 we adopt @xmath47 ( assuming @xmath48 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a thin spherical shell of radius @xmath49 infalling with velocity @xmath20 covers a sloped line on the velocity - delay map , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the delay increasing from @xmath52 at @xmath53 on the near side to @xmath54 at @xmath55 on the far side of the shell . the freefall model in figure  5",
    "has a spherical distribution of infalling gas with @xmath56  lt - days and @xmath57  lt - days , and @xmath58 , giving small delays on the red side and longer delays with a virial envelope on the blue side of the map .",
    "this naturally produces the required asymmetry .",
    "the lack of prompt response in the line core can arise by means of an inward radiation anisotropy ( as displayed in figure  5 with @xmath59 ) and/or by reducing the response of the inner gas .",
    "models with radially outflowing gas have the opposite asymmetry and are thus largely ruled out .    for an inclined circular orbit",
    "the velocity - delay structure is an ellipse with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the basic virial envelope , with a wider velocity range at smaller delays , can be reproduced by distributions of circular keplerian orbits ranging from isotropically distributed angular momentum to inclined disks ( e.g. , the thick spherical shell and isotropically illuminated disk models in figure  5 ) . for such models",
    "the balmer response at small delay in the line core can be reduced by ( 1 ) anisotropic ionizing radiation directed toward the far side , ( 2 ) anisotropic inwardly directed line response , and/or ( 3 ) excluding edge - on orbits to form an inclined disk - like geometry .",
    "the enhanced prompt response in the red wing is hard to reproduce with a symmetric distribution of circular orbits .",
    "if the orbits circulate in the same direction , however , then the required asymmetry can be introduced by azimuthal structure - enhancing response ( a `` hot spot '' ) on the receding side of the inner disk .",
    "while this is somewhat _ ad hoc _ , it might plausibly arise in the context of a warped - disk geometry , the warp exposing gas to ionizing radiation at small radius while shielding it at larger radius .",
    "the disk  +  hotspot model displayed in figure  5 is inclined ( @xmath62 ) with @xmath63  lt - days and @xmath57  lt - days .",
    "no emission originates from the near side of the disk due to its warped shape , and excess emission arises on the receding portion of the inner disk at 0.10.3  lt - days .",
    "both the infall model and disk  +  hotspot model qualitatively reproduce the observed features of the velocity - delay maps , and more work is necessary to determine which family of models is preferred . in the meantime , we note that warped disks are seen in many astrophysical environments and have previously been invoked to explain various agn phenomena ( e.g. , flux variations in the double - peaked broad emission from ngc1097 , @xcite ; fe emission - line profiles in the x - rays , @xcite ; the misalignment of radio jets and nuclear disks , @xcite ; and a self - contained apparatus for agn unification , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider here the plausibility of irradiation - induced warping @xcite , in which an optically thick , geometrically thin disk irradiated by a central source is unstable to warping from radiation pressure .",
    "the instability criterion is @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the ratio of the viscosities in the plane of and perpendicular to the disk ( assumed here to be equal , i.e. , @xmath67 ) , and @xmath68 is the accretion efficiency . assuming @xmath69 , a disk in the blr of arp151 could become unstable on length scales @xmath70lt - day , inside the scale of the optical blr . for typical estimates of blr parameters ( following @xcite )",
    ", the precession timescale would likely be decades to centuries .",
    "we have recovered velocity - delay maps for six optical hydrogen and helium recombination lines in the lamp spectra of arp151 using the maximum - entropy method .",
    "these are the most detailed velocity - delay maps constructed to date .",
    "the individual balmer lines have similar velocity - delay structure , and the maps show responses with delays increasing from h@xmath0 to h@xmath1 to h@xmath2 .",
    "this can be interpreted as radial stratification through the balmer series and is expected from optical - depth effects .",
    "all three lines show prompt response in their red wings , contrary to what has been seen in ngc5548 .",
    "the helium - line response is mostly unresolved in time .",
    "the features seen in the balmer - line velocity - delay maps can be reproduced qualitatively with either of two simple _ ad hoc _ models : a freefalling blr , or a partially illuminated thin disk with a localized excess of emission at small radii that could be interpreted as a warped disk .",
    "warped disks are known to occur in many environments and on many astronomical scales , and it is plausible that the blr in agns is another manifestation of this common configuration , as has been previously suggested in the literature .",
    "it appears to be impossible for a simple disk model or a thick spherical shell composed of randomly inclined circular orbits to accurately reproduce the features seen in the velocity - delay maps , including the strong emission at short lag times in the red wings of the balmer lines and the lack of emission at short lag times in the line cores .",
    "radial outflows are also largely ruled out by the observed asymmetric response .",
    "the simple models and plausibility arguments presented here are the first steps in interpreting the velocity - delay maps for arp151 .",
    "we are currently investigating other lamp targets and expect to recover velocity - delay maps for a few additional objects , which may lead to insights into blr differences across the seyfert  1 population .",
    "future monitoring programs will benefit from even higher temporal sampling and the avoidance of any gaps in the driving continuum light curve , allowing the driving light curve to provide stronger constraints and leading to more detailed velocity - delay maps of the emission - line responses .",
    "more sophisticated modeling will also help with interpreting the velocity - delay maps and determining which families of blr models can be ruled out , allowing additional insights into the complexities of agn blrs .",
