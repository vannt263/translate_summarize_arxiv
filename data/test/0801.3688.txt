    "one - dimensional quantum systems have always attracted a lot of theoretical interest : their exact solutions give , in fact , useful insights on the role of the interactions and other non - perturbative features @xcite . in this respect , the growing ability to realize and manipulate one - dimensional bose gases @xcite has provided an highly controllable experimental counterpart to these theoretical achievements .",
    "quasi - one - dimensional bose gases are obtained by using a cigar - shaped external trapping potential , elongated in a direction , with the other degrees of freedom frozen due to the presence of a tight transverse confinement . in the experiments ,",
    "several variants of the interacting bose gas in one dimension can be implemented : an optical lattice can be added to detect the mott - superfluid transition in one dimension @xcite , the effective one - dimensional interaction can be tuned @xcite to observe a tonks - girardeau gas of ultracold atoms @xcite , or the effect of the temperature can be studied @xcite .",
    "important tools that permit to further control the properties of low - dimensional bose systems are the tuning of an external magnetic field near a feshbach resonance @xcite , and , in perspective , the implementation of the recently proposed schemes to engineer effective three - body interactions @xcite .    the technique of feshbach resonances permits to change the sign of the scattering length : by switching from repulsion to attraction , i.e. from positive to negative scattering length , the homogeneous @xmath2-d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) admits a solution corresponding to a localized wave - function , the so - called _ bright soliton _",
    "bright matter - wave solitons were created both in bose - einstein condensates of @xmath3li @xcite and @xmath4rb atoms @xcite .",
    "various localized states has been also produced in quasi - one - dimensional geometries ( for reviews see the book @xcite ) .    with attractive two - body interactions ,",
    "a crucial role is played both by the dimension of the system and the trapping potential . in three dimensions , for instance",
    ", homogeneous attractive bosons are unstable against the collapse , but the presence of an external harmonic trap can stabilize them : the critical value of the interaction coupling that gives rise to the collapse can be obtained from the gpe @xcite , and the critical particle number is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total number of particles , @xmath7 is the scattering length and @xmath8 is the harmonic oscillator length @xcite . in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "the bright soliton solution is the ground state of the homogeneous gpe with negative scattering length .",
    "furthermore , the gpe ground state energy is in agreement , in the thermodynamic limit , with the ground state energy obtained by bethe ansatz for the attractive one - dimensional bose gas @xcite ( see more in section ii ) .    in this paper , motivated by the recent papers @xcite in which different schemes have been proposed to realize effective tunable three - body interactions",

    "since no bethe solution is available in the general case of @xmath0-body interaction , we employ an hartree approximation to study the problem in the limit mentioned above .",
    "this means that the ground state energy is estimated by using the bright soliton solution of a generalized mean - field gpe equation .",
    "as we will show , the @xmath1 is a special case : for this value , in fact , a localized soliton wavefunction exists only for a critical value of the interaction strength and has an infinite degeneracy .",
    "the stabilization of this bound state can be cured by putting the system in an external harmonic trap .",
    "the variational approach , that we will also employ , reveals the tendency of the higher body interactions to become more unstable in higher dimensions .",
    "it is worth stressing that the case we are considering does not consist of a @xmath0-body interaction added to the @xmath12-body interaction of the bose gas : we are interested , in fact , to the effect of the @xmath0-body in its own , since the coefficient of the two - body interaction can be tuned to be zero @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section ii we introduce the hamiltonian corresponding to @xmath0-body contact attractive interactions and we write the ( mean - field ) generalized gpe .",
    "the familiar case @xmath13 is briefly recalled . in section",
    "iii the bright soliton solution for the homogeneous limit is obtained by using a mechanical analogy with a fictitious particle moving in a potential , and its properties are investigated .",
    "the comparison with the numerical results confirms that for @xmath14 this is the ground state of the generalized gpe , as expected .",
    "the ground state energy by varying @xmath0 is also determined . in section",
    "iv we consider the effect of an harmonic trap : using a variational ansatz for the ground state we determine the critical value of the interaction needed to stabilize the bound state . in section",
    "v there are our conclusions .",

    "the low - energy properties of the lieb - liniger model can be studied by the luttinger liquid effective description @xcite obtained by bosonization @xcite ( a general discussion of the correlation functions is presented in @xcite ) .    for @xmath0-body attractive contact interactions we set @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) : the hamiltonian ( [ ham - gen ] ) reads then @xmath22 in the heisenberg representation , the equation of motion for the field operator is given by @xmath23= -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m } \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2 } \\hat{\\psi } -   c \\left ( \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dag } \\right)^{n-1 } \\left ( \\hat{\\psi } \\right)^{n-1 } \\hat{\\psi}\\,\\,\\ , .",

    "a comment is in order : in the homogeneous one - dimensional interacting case there is , strictly speaking , no condensate .",
    "however the condition @xmath39 implies that , for large @xmath6 , the coupling constant should scale to zero , @xmath40 : hence , we are in a weak coupling regime where the mean - field gpe is expected to give reasonable results . in a similar way , for @xmath41 ( repulsive interaction ) the comparison between the exact and the gpe ground state energy shows that the latter gives the correct behaviour for @xmath40 while the bogoliubov approximation gives the exact first - order corrections for small @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "based on the analysis above , for general @xmath0 and in the limit @xmath40 we expect that a reasonable description of both the ground state properties and the low - energy dynamics is given by the mean - field generalized homogeneous gpe @xmath43 where the nonlinearity degree @xmath44 of the generalized nonlinear schrdinger ( gnlse ) equation is related to @xmath0 by @xmath45 the mean - field ground state is given by the time - independent gnlse equation @xmath46 where , as before , @xmath31 is chemical potential and @xmath47 is normalized to the total number of particles @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath48 .    with @xmath49 integer , @xmath44 is an even integer ; however , in eqn .",

    "let s comment that the axial dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate induced by an external potential with cylindrical symmetry in the transverse directions can be studied by introducing an effective one - dimensional gpe equation with @xmath50 @xcite and that for bose - einstein condensates in one - dimensional optical lattices the effective equation has a value of @xmath44 that depends on the details of the trapping potentials and it is , in general , a non - integer value @xcite .",

    "it was shown that a system of atoms and molecules in a one - dimensional lattice can be effectively modeled by a three - body local ( i.e. , contact ) interaction , characterized by a strength @xmath204 and in the limit @xmath205 ( without a two - body interaction ) the ground state properties were investigated by a pfaffian - like ansatz .",
    "the strength @xmath204 of the three - body interaction can be made also negative by using feshbach resonances .",
    "one of the main reasons of interest of these proposals relies on the fact that exotic quantum phases , such as topological phases , appear to be ground states of hamiltonian with three or more body interaction terms , an example being the fractional quantum hall states described by the pfaffian wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "the excitations of pfaffian states are non - abelian anyons , on which schemes of fault - tolerant topological quantum computation are based @xcite .",
    "we think that , in perspective , the possibility to induce and tune effective @xmath96-body interactions could become an important tool to control the nonlinear dynamical properties of localized wave - packets and to induce new exotic strongly correlated phases in ultracold atoms .    _",

    "<S> we study the ground state properties of a one - dimensional bose gas with @xmath0-body attractive contact interactions . by using the explicit form of the bright soliton solution of a generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation , we compute the chemical potential and the ground state energy . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath1 , a localized soliton wave - function exists only for a critical value of the interaction strength : in this case the ground state has an infinite degeneracy that can be parameterized by the chemical potential . </S>",
