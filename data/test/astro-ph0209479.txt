    "there are strong correlations among the measurable physical properties of galaxies .",
    "the classification of galaxies along the visual morphological sequence described by @xcite correlates well with the dominance of their central bulge , their surface brightnesses , and their colors .",
    "these properties also correlate with other properties , such as metallicity , emission - line strength , luminosity in visual bands , neutral gas content , and the winding angle of the spiral structure ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the surface brightnesses of giant galaxies classified morphologically as elliptical are known to be strongly correlated with their sizes ( @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy colors ( at least of morphologically elliptical galaxies ) are known to be strongly correlated with galaxy luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational mass of a galaxy is closely related to the luminosity and other galaxy properties .",
    "these galaxy relations manifest themselves in the tully - fisher relation for spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) and the fundamental plane for morphologically elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) ; @xcite review these dynamical relations .",
    "furthermore , the environment of a galaxy is related to its type , in the sense that early - type galaxies are found in denser regions than late - type galaxies , as first noted by @xcite and as found by numerous subsequent investigators ( @xcite ) . in short , different physical properties of galaxies are closely related to each other .    in order to understand theoretically how galaxies formed and acquired their current properties , it is first necessary to characterize the observed distribution of galaxy properties in a comprehensive manner .",
    "such a characterization is a primary goal of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sdss has already created the largest sample to date ( 144,609 galaxies ) of luminous galaxies with well - measured photometric and spectroscopic properties . as a first step in understanding the joint distribution of galaxy properties , we present here a study of the number density and luminosity density distributions of galaxy colors , profiles , luminosities , surface brightnesses , and local densities .",
    "our purpose is to measure properties related to quantities that cosmological gasdynamical simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or semi - analytic models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) can predict or will soon be able to predict , such as galaxy ages , sizes , stellar masses , and degrees of concentration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ data ] briefly describes the spectroscopic sample of the sdss .",
    "section [ properties ] describes how we measure the set of properties studied here .",
    "section [ results ] shows the number density and luminosity density distributions of these properties of galaxies , and provides simple fits for the dependence on luminosity of the properties of galaxies with nearly exponential radial profiles and those with more concentrated radial profiles .",
    "section [ conclusion ] summarizes and outlines future lines of research .",
    "the sdss ( @xcite ) is producing imaging and spectroscopic surveys over @xmath8 steradians in the northern galactic cap . a dedicated wide - field 2.5 m telescope ( siegmund et al .",
    ", in preparation ) at apache point observatory , sunspot , new mexico , images the sky in five bands between 3000 and 10000   ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath1 , @xmath12 ; @xcite ) using a drift - scanning , mosaic ccd camera ( @xcite ) , detecting objects to a flux limit of @xmath13 mags .",
    "the photometric quality of the observations are tracked using an automatic photometricity monitor ( @xcite ) .",
    "an automatic image - processing pipeline known as photo ( lupton et al . in preparation ) processes the images and produces a catalog . the astrometric calibration is also performed by an automatic pipeline ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the goals is to spectroscopically observe 900,000 galaxies , ( down to @xmath14 mags ) , 100,000 luminous red galaxies ( @xcite ) , and 100,000 quasars ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this spectroscopic follow up uses two digital spectrographs on the same telescope as the imaging camera .",
    "many of the details of the galaxy survey are described in the galaxy target selection paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "other aspects of the survey are described in the early data release paper ( edr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the survey has begun in earnest , and to date has obtained about 30% of its intended data .    the sdss images are reduced and catalogs are produced by the sdss pipeline photo , which measures the sky background and the seeing conditions , and detects and measures objects .",
    "the photometry used here for the bulk of these objects was the same as that used when the objects were targeted .",
    "however , for those objects which were in the edr photometric catalog , we used the better calibrations and photometry from the edr .",
    "the versions of the sdss pipeline photo used for the reductions of the data used here ranged from v5_0 to v5_2 .",
    "the treatment of relatively small galaxies , which account for most of our sample , did not change substantially throughout these versions . the astrometric calibration is also performed by an automatic pipeline which obtains absolute positions to better than 0.1 arcsec ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magnitudes are calibrated to a standard star network ( @xcite ) approximately in the ab system .",
    "there are small differences between the system output by the sdss pipelines and a true ab system , amounting to @xmath15 in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath12 bands .",
    "because these were discovered at a relatively late date in the preparation of this manuscript , we have not self - consistently included these shifts in our results ( that is , by recalculating @xmath16-corrections based on the revised colors ) .",
    "instead we have applied them _ a posteriori _ to our results in the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 bands .",
    "object fluxes are determined several different ways by photo , as described in @xcite .",
    "the primary measure of flux used for galaxies is the sdss petrosian magnitude , a modified version of the quantity proposed by @xcite .",
    "the essential feature of petrosian magnitudes is that in the absence of seeing they measure a constant fraction of a galaxy s light regardless of distance ( or size ) .",
    "they are described in greater detail below ( and also by @xcite and @xcite ) . as measures of the galaxy profile shape ,",
    "photo also calculates the radius containing half the petrosian flux ( @xmath22 ) and that containing 90% of the petrosian flux ( @xmath23 ) .    as described in @xcite , the bulk of the fibers in the sdss",
    "are allocated to three samples : the main sample galaxies , the luminous red galaxies , and quasars . here",
    "we will concern ourselves solely with the main sample galaxies .",
    "there are three main criteria for their selection : @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is an estimate of the magnitude using the local psf as a weighted aperture , @xmath26 is an estimate of the magnitude using the better of a de  vaucouleurs and an exponential fit to the image ( accounting for seeing ) , @xmath27 is a modified form of the magnitude described by @xcite , and @xmath28 is the half - light surface brightness , defined as the average surface brightness within the radius which contains half of the petrosian flux .",
    "all of these quantities are reddening - corrected using the dust maps of @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the values of the target selection parameters vary across the survey in a well - understood way , but for the bulk of the area , they are : @xmath29 , @xmath30 mag , and @xmath31 mag in 1 arcsec@xmath32 .",
    "objects near the spectroscopic flux limit are nearly five magnitudes brighter than the photometric limit ; that is , the fluxes are measured at signal - to - noise ratio of a few hundred .",
    "fibers are assigned to a set of circular tiles with a field of view @xmath33 deg in radius by an automatic tiling pipeline ( @xcite ) .",
    "the targets are observed by a multi - fiber spectrograph capable of taking 640 spectra simultaneously ( 48 of the fibers are , in normal sdss operations , devoted to sky fibers and spectrophotometric standards ) . an automatic data processing pipeline spec2d wavelength- and flux - calibrates the spectra and outputs a one - dimensional spectrum for each object ( schlegel , et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the resulting spectra have a resolution of @xmath34 , cover roughly 3800   to 9000  , and typically have signal - to - noise per pixel around 10 .",
    "this spectrum is then analyzed by another pipeline ( spectro1d ; subbarao , et al . , in preparation ) which classifies the spectrum and determines the redshift of the object .",
    "the redshifts used in the current analysis are determined independently using a separate pipeline originally designed specifically for bright stars(specbs ; schlegel , et al . , in preparation ) whose results are nearly identical for the main galaxy sample to the `` official '' sdss redshift determination ( over 99% of the objects obtain nearly identical redshifts in each pipeline ) .    as of april 2002 , the sdss had imaged and targeted 2,873 deg@xmath32 of sky and taken spectra of approximately 350,000 objects over @xmath35 deg@xmath32 of that area .",
    "the completeness over this area is roughly 91% ; most of the missing galaxies ( 7% of the total ) are lost due to the fact that two fibers on the same tile can not be placed more closely than 55@xmath36 , about 1% are lost because they are not able to be assigned a fiber , and about 1% can not have a redshift determined . from these data",
    ", we created a well - defined sample for calculating large - scale structure and galaxy property statistics , known as large - scale structure sample10 .",
    "sample10 consists of all of the photometry for all of the targets over that area ( as extracted from the internal sdss operational database ) , all of the spectroscopic results ( as output from specbs ) , and , most significantly , a description of the angular window function of the survey and the flux and surface brightness limits used for galaxies in each area of the sky . for most of the area , the same version of the analysis software used to create the target list was used in this sample .",
    "however , for the area covered by the early data release ( edr ; @xcite ) we used the version of the analysis software used for that data release , since it was substantially better than the early versions of the software used to target that area .",
    "for photo , the most important piece of analysis software run on the data , the versions used for the photometry range from v5_0 to v5_2 .",
    "the region covered by this sample is similar to , but not exactly , the region which will be released in the sdss data release 1 ( dr1 ) , scheduled for january 1 , 2003 ( which will use photo v5_3 , a newer version of the software which among other things improves the handling of large galaxies ) .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we further restrict sample10 to galaxies in the redshift range @xmath37 , the absolute magnitude range @xmath38 ( assuming a hubble constant @xmath39 km@xmath40 s@xmath40 mpc@xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , and to galaxies with @xmath42 . to calculate the distance modulus and the comoving volume we assume a model with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these cuts restrict our sample to 144,609 galaxies .",
    "figure [ emg_imagr50 ] shows the distributions of @xmath1-band apparent magnitude ( corrected for galactic extinction ) and petrosian half - light radius for this sample of galaxies .",
    "the roll - off at the brightest and faintest magnitudes occurs because we have selected the sample in the @xmath11-band .",
    "here we describe the set of galaxy properties whose joint distribution we intend to measure , and how those properties are measured by the sdss .",
    "these properties are colors , luminosities , profile shapes , surface brightnesses , and local densities .      to measure the galaxy fluxes , we rely on the sdss petrosian magnitudes .",
    "the essential feature of petrosian magnitudes is that in the absence of seeing they measure a constant fraction of a galaxy s light regardless of distance ( or size ) .",
    "more specifically , we define the `` petrosian ratio '' @xmath45 at a radius @xmath11 from the center of an object to be the ratio of the local surface brightness averaged over an annulus at @xmath11 to the mean surface brightness within @xmath11 : @xmath46}{\\left . \\int_0^r",
    "dr ' 2\\pi r ' i(r ' ) \\right/ [ \\pi r^2]},\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile and @xmath48 , @xmath49 define the annulus .",
    "the sdss has adopted @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the petrosian radius @xmath52 is the radius at which the @xmath45 falls below a threshhold value @xmath53 , set to 0.2 for the sdss .",
    "the petrosian flux is defined as the flux within a circular aperture with a radius equal to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 for the sdss .",
    "petrosian magnitudes are described in greater detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while sdss petrosian magnitudes contain over 99% of the flux within an exponential profile , they contain only around 80% of the flux within a de  vaucouleurs profile in the absence of seeing ; the fraction is higher in the presence of seeing , as shown by @xcite .",
    "for the sdss , @xmath52 is defined in the @xmath11-band and used to set the aperture for all the bands , such that the colors represent a measure of spectral energy distribution of the galaxy over a well - defined region of the galaxy .    here",
    "we constrain the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies using the broad - band colors between the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath12 petrosian magnitudes of the sdss . a given set of observer - frame galaxy colors",
    "does not correspond uniquely to a particular sed , so we can not infer with certainty the colors in any other frame .",
    "however , we can use our knowledge of the form of galaxy seds based on other data to make an attempt in order to interpolate between the observed - frame colors to a different frame by fitting a reasonable model sed to the galaxy colors . to do so",
    ", we use the routines in kcorrect v1_11 , described by @xcite , which uses a similar method to the method of @xcite for calculating photometric redshifts .",
    "this method is demonstrably better than using the spectra ( which suffer from the aperture biases associated with small - fiber spectroscopy , the inaccuracy of spectrophotometry , and the fact that we do not take spectra in the @xmath9 and @xmath12 bands ; _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) and better than simply interpolating the magnitudes between bands ( which does not account well for the 4000   break ) .",
    "the essence of the method is that each set of observed magnitudes in the five bands is fit by a linear combination of four templates .",
    "the coefficients in the linear combination , and the templates themselves , are optimized to reproduce the observed magnitudes . for each galaxy",
    ", we now have a model for the sed .",
    "we use this sed to calculate the correction from the observed band to fixed frame bandpasses with shapes corresponding the the restframe coverage of galaxies at @xmath56 , the median redshift of the sample .",
    "the usual choice is to correct the colors to the @xmath57 frame ; however , this choice is not optimal , because most galaxies in our sample are not at @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ response ] shows the responses of the unshifted sdss and the sdss system shifted to @xmath58 .",
    "we refer to bands in this system as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , following the nomenclature of @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that the @xmath16-correction for a galaxy _ at _ redshift @xmath56 to this system is @xmath59 for all bands independent of galaxy sed .    as a test of the validity of the colors ,",
    "figure [ emg_colors ] shows the distribution of galaxy colors as a function of redshift in a volume - limited sample in the range @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the greyscale is the conditional distribution of color on redshift .",
    "the middle line in each panel is the median , the outer lines are the 10% and 90% quantiles .",
    "the distribution of galaxy colors is nearly constant with redshift , indicating that the @xmath16-corrections are relatively sensible .",
    "note that we expect some change in these distributions given that galaxies evolve ; in fact there is a hint of such evolution in the @xmath62 plot .",
    "we use these estimated petrosian @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 colors as our measures of the sed shape for each galaxy . as a measure of luminosity",
    ", we use the @xmath1-band flux converted to @xmath20-band luminosity luminosity using the @xmath16-correction and the standard cosmological formulae for the distance modulus , assuming @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( @xcite ) .",
    "one measure of the morphology of galaxies is the radial dependence of their surface brightness .",
    "for example , if one expresses this radial dependence in the form ( suggested by @xcite ) : @xmath69,\\ ] ] galaxies with nearly exponential profiles ( srsic  index @xmath70 ) tend to be considered `` late - type , '' while galaxies with nearly de  vaucouleurs profiles ( srsic  index @xmath71 ) tend to be considered `` early - type . ''",
    "for this reason , we use measures of the azimuthally - averaged radial profiles of the galaxies in our analysis .    although @xcite and @xcite have shown that the petrosian inverse concentration index @xmath72 is reasonably well correlated with eyeball morphological classifications for nearby , large galaxies , this parameter is too sensitive to the effects of seeing to be of great use for the bulk of the sdss main sample .",
    "the top panel of figure [ emg_seeing ] shows the dependence of inverse concentration parameter on seeing for a volume - limited subsample , limited to galaxies with @xmath73 and @xmath74 , demonstrating this dependence .",
    "this seeing dependence means that the same galaxy , observed under different conditions , can have considerably different measured concentrations .",
    "even more importantly , it implies that the same galaxy , observed at different _ distances _ , will have different measured concentrations .",
    "photo fits two - dimensional models to the galaxy images which account for the effects of seeing , but they are limited to the cases of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and in addition ( because they were designed to study faint galaxy colors ) for the versions of photo used here ( before v5_3 ) they only performed the fit out to a relatively small radius compared to the size of an sdss spectroscopic target galaxy .",
    "thus , for our work here we have decided to fit the parameters in equation ( [ sersic ] ) to the radial profile of each galaxy ( accounting for the effects of seeing ) .    in order to do so , we find the parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 in equation ( [ sersic ] ) which minimize @xmath80 with respect to the observed @xmath1-band radial profile and errors ( as expressed by the profmean and proferr parameters in the sdss catalog ) .",
    "when performing the fit , we convolve with the axisymmetric double gaussian fit to the psf determined by the sdss photometric pipeline ( lupton et al . , in preparation ) . the resulting distribution of @xmath80 per degree of freedom peaks at approximately unity , but has a much larger tail than expected for gaussian errors ; this suggests that a more detailed model ( either for the seeing or for galaxy profiles ) which better fits the data is possible to develop . after performing the fit",
    ", we can calculate the petrosian inverse concentration parameter @xmath81 based on the srsic  index @xmath79 .",
    "the top panel of figure [ emg_seeing ] shows this inverse concentration parameter as a function of seeing for the volume - limited subsample .",
    "our measure of galaxy profile shape is less seeing - dependent than the raw estimate @xmath81 .",
    "we have fit srsic  profiles to the profiles of all bands ; the results of the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath12 profiles are all fairly consistent , while the @xmath9 band results tend to be much less concentrated than the others .",
    "it is worth examining how our axisymmetric srsic  fit is affected by the non - axisymmetry of galaxies , and how it is related to other measures of profile shape , such as the petrosian concentration parameter and the bulge - to - total ( @xmath82 ) ratio . in the top panels of figure [ test_nfit_plot ] ,",
    "we investigate how our srsic  fits behave for galaxies with srsic  profiles and galaxies which consist of a de  vaucouleurs bulge plus an exponential disk . in each case",
    "we assume the galaxies are comparable in half - light radius to sdss main sample galaxies .",
    "we use three different axis ratios @xmath83 ( as listed in figure [ test_nfit_plot ] ) by which we distort the galaxy image .",
    "we then project that image onto a grid of pixels of size @xmath84 , the size of sdss pixels , apply single gaussian seeing with a standard deviation of @xmath85 , and then extract radial profiles using a similar scheme as used by sdss photo . using the single gaussian model for the seeing",
    ", we fit the srsic  models to the resulting galaxy profiles .",
    "we perfectly reconstruct the case of @xmath83 for the srsicprofiles ; for small axis ratios , we measure a higher concentration than we would for a circular image with the same profile as along the semi - major axis . for the bulge - plus - disk models , we find that the srsic  index @xmath79 is monotonically related to the @xmath82 ratio of the bulge flux to the total flux .",
    "the bottom panels of figure [ test_nfit_plot ] show the dependence of the petrosian inverse concentration parameter @xmath81 for galaxies of the same shapes as , but larger radii than , the galaxies in the top panels .",
    "this situation is meant to be similar to the conditions under which galaxies were observed by @xcite and @xcite , who observed large , bright galaxies less affected by seeing than those in the sdss main sample .",
    "we find that @xmath81 is closely related to srsic  index and @xmath82 .",
    "we define the half - light surface brightness @xmath86 to be the average surface brightness within the petrosian half - light radius for the srsic  profile fit in the @xmath20-band , in magnitudes in one arcsec@xmath32 , @xmath16-corrected and corrected for cosmological surface brightness dimming : @xmath87 this measure of surface brightness is thus slightly different ( in general , higher ) than the raw estimate calculated from the petrosian half - light radius output by the sdss photometric pipeline , because it is corrected for seeing .",
    "note that we have implicitly assumed that the @xmath16-correction of the observation of surface brightness remains unaffected by color gradients in the galaxy ; because the @xmath16-correction from the observed @xmath1 band to the @xmath20 band are expected to vary little with redshift and color ( @xmath88 magnitudes ) this approximation is not bad .      for each object in the sample",
    "we estimate the local galaxy density @xmath89 as follows .",
    "first , we distribute a large number ( @xmath90 ) of poisson random points within the sdss volume , distributed in redshift according to the selection function of the survey .",
    "the selection function is determined by an evolving @xmath19-band schechter function fit to the luminosity function of the following form ( following @xcite ) : @xmath91 where @xmath92 expressed in magnitudes , this implies @xmath93 . if @xmath94 , these formulae mean galaxies are brighter in the past .",
    "we indeed find that in order to explain the dependence of number counts on redshift in the survey , it is necessary to include the possibility that galaxy luminosities evolve .",
    "we perform this fit in the @xmath19 band and find the parameters : @xmath95 we do not give error bars for this fit , nor do we recommend this fit as our best estimate of the luminosity density or its evolution",
    ". we do not give error bars for this fit , nor do we recommend this fit as our best estimate of the luminosity density or its evolution .",
    "a more complete discussion of this topic is forthcoming in a separate paper .",
    "however , this fit is good enough to use to estimate local density .",
    "using this fit , the magnitude limits as a function of position on the sky ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) , and the spectroscopic sampling fraction as a function of position on the sky ( @xmath98 ) we can calculate the selection function at any point on the sky .",
    "given the galaxy catalog and the random catalog , we count the number of galaxies @xmath99 ( including the galaxy in question ) and the number of random points @xmath100 in a 8 @xmath0 mpc radius comoving sphere around each galaxy .",
    "we define @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the average expected number of objects in the sphere .",
    "we use this as an estimate of the local density relative to the mean . because we use a spherical cell only 800 km s@xmath40 in radius , this measure of density is affected somewhat by the velocity dispersions in the deep potential wells of clusters , in the sense that it will slightly underestimate the density in those regions . also , since it is centered on a galaxy , and galaxies are clustered on these scales , its mean is greater than unity .",
    "the local density is the only quantity considered here which is measured with a large amounts of noise for each object .",
    "the average `` expected '' number of objects for a poisson distribution in each cell is about 14 ; the average actual number is about 37 ( it is so much larger because the variance of the overdensity on this scales is around unity ) .",
    "this indicates that the average cell has errors of @xmath103",
    ". in particular , distant galaxies ( which only have the brightest galaxies at that redshift within 8 @xmath0 mpc ) tend to have a measurement of @xmath89 noisier than do close galaxies .",
    "one can not really consider the joint distribution of the local density measured here and other galaxy properties , without accounting for the noise in the measure of the local density ( @xcite ) .",
    "because of these effects , the galaxies which have the highest density estimates are just the galaxies with the smallest expected number of galaxies around them ( and thus the highest expected noise in the measurement ) .",
    "furthermore , the galaxies with the smallest expected number of galaxies around them are those at the highest redshift , and are therefore the highest luminosity galaxies .",
    "this introduces a correlation between the luminosity of a galaxy and the noise in our estimate of the density .",
    "the galaxies with the highest density estimates are high luminosity galaxies simply because of this artificial correlation between luminosity and measurement noise .",
    "this effect means that one can not determine ( from our measurements ) the density dependence of luminosity ( or any property correlated with it  that is , all galaxy properties ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can still meaningfully consider the median density within bins of other galaxy properties , because the increased noise for galaxies with higher mean distances does not affect the median density .",
    "as proof of this assertion , figure [ emg_density ] shows the density distribution as a function of redshift for several small ranges of absolute magnitude .",
    "the lines are the 10% , 50% , and 90% quantiles of the distribution .",
    "although at large distances the distribution widens ( the 10% and 90% quantiles decrease and increase , respectively ) , the median remains remarkably constant , indicating that it measures the density around galaxies consistently at high redshift and at low redshift .",
    "this consistency means that even when we divide galaxies into different groups which cover different redshift ranges ( such as dividing by luminosity ) we can make a fair comparison among the median local densities of the groups .",
    "this consistency happens to be the justification for the common practice of calculating the correlation function for galaxies of different luminosities , in different redshift ranges .      to compute the global number and luminosity densities , it is necessary to compute the number - density contribution @xmath104 for each galaxy , where @xmath105 is the volume covered by the survey in which this galaxy could have been observed , accounting for the flux , surface brightness , and redshift limits as a function of angle ( schmidt 1968 ) .",
    "this volume is calculated as follows : @xmath106 where @xmath98 is described above and @xmath107 and @xmath108 are defined by : @xmath109 the flux limits @xmath110 ( equal to 14.5  mag across the survey ) and @xmath111 ( approximately 17.77  mag ) implicitly set @xmath112 by : @xmath113 the surface brightness limits @xmath114 ( in practice , too high surface brightness to matter for this sample ) and @xmath115 ( approximately 24.5  mag but variable in a known way across the survey ) implicitly set @xmath116 by : @xmath117 note that we have implicitly assumed that the @xmath16-correction of the observation of surface brightness remains unaffected by color gradients in the galaxy . in practice ,",
    "the surface brightness limits only rarely affect the @xmath105 determination .",
    "the function @xmath98 is the sdss sampling fraction of galaxies as a function of position on the sky .",
    "the total sampling rate of galaxies is computed separately for each region covered by a unique set of spectroscopic survey tiles .",
    "we adopt the nomenclature of the 2df ( @xcite ) : each such region is a `` sector '' ( which corresponds identically to the `` overlap regions '' defined in @xcite ) .",
    "that is , in the case of two overlapping tiles , the sampling is calculated separately in three sectors : the sector covered only by the first tile , the sector covered only by the second tile , and the sector covered by both .",
    "each position on the sky is thereby assigned a sampling rate @xmath98 equal to the number of redshifts of galaxy targets obtained in the region divided by the number of galaxy targets in the region . in regions covered by a single tile , typically @xmath118 ; in multiple plate regions , typically @xmath119 .",
    "these completenesses average to 0.92 .    with @xmath120",
    ", we calculate the global number and luminosity density contributions of any group of galaxies as @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "our primary results on the distributions of colors , surface brightnesses , profile shapes , luminosities and local densities of galaxies are shown in figures [ emg_num][emg_num_cond ] .",
    "each of these plots is a multi - panel figure showing some form of the bivariate distribution of every pair of galaxy properties in the off - diagonal plots .",
    "the plots on the diagonal show the univariate distribution of each quantity .",
    "figure [ emg_num ] shows the projected number density distribution for all pairs of seven of our parameters , excluding density ( for reasons described above ) .",
    "the @xmath123  values calculated above are used to calculate the contribution of each galaxy to the total number density .",
    "the panels above and below the diagonal are mirror images of each other .",
    "the grey scale is proportional to the square - root of the projected density in that plane .",
    "contours in the plot represent loci of constant projected density enclosing 68% and 95% of the density .",
    "figure [ emg_lum ] shows the bivariate @xmath20-band luminosity density distribution between all of our parameters . this figure is similar to figure [ emg_num ] , only now each object contributes @xmath124 rather than @xmath104 to the density .",
    "figure [ emg_num_cond ] shows the conditional number density distribution of all eight of our parameters relative to seven of them ( only excluding density as an independent variable ) .",
    "that is , the greyscale represents the probability of a particular value of the quantity on the vertical axis , given the value of the quantity on the horizontal axis .",
    "this is equivalent to taking figure [ emg_num ] , and for each vertical column of pixels renormalizing by the total density in that column .",
    "this plot is useful when the dependence of one quantity on another is strong in the regime where there are few galaxies ( such as at high density or high luminosity ) .",
    "the histograms along the diagonal are the number density distributions of each quantity , and are identical to the histograms in figure [ emg_num ] .",
    "some basic results are visible in these plots , which we review in the following subsections .",
    "many of these results have been noted in the literature in the past .",
    "we will concentrate mostly on figure [ emg_num_cond ] , in which many of the relationships are easiest to see .",
    "the first simple result to point out from figure [ emg_num_cond ] is the histogram in the right column and the second row from the top , which shows the luminosity function in the @xmath125-band .",
    "the function is close to a schechter function , although because the vertical scale is linear , it may not appear familiar .",
    "now consider the same panel in figure [ emg_lum ] , which shows the luminosity density as a function of absolute magnitude .",
    "it is clear from this plot that the luminosity density is almost entirely contained within the range of absolute magnitudes shown ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "we may further ask whether the surface brightness limits ( around @xmath127 ) greatly affect any estimate of the luminosity density from this sample .",
    "the histogram in figure [ emg_lum ] showing the luminosity density as a function of surface brightness demonstrates that the luminosity density falls off long before the surface brightness limit becomes important .",
    "an even clearer demonstration of this fact is the panel showing the luminosity density versus @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "this panel shows that even at the lowest luminosities in the sample , the surface brightness limit excludes very little luminosity density .",
    "these results are in agreement with @xcite ( using early sdss data ) and @xcite ( using early 2dfgrs data ) .",
    "a more careful analysis of the luminosity function and its evolution from this sample is being carried out by blanton et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    next , let us follow the right column of figure [ emg_num_cond ] down from the top .",
    "each panel below the top panel shows the conditional dependence of a galaxy parameter on luminosity .",
    "these panels show many of the familiar relationships of galaxy properties to luminosity from previous observations . in sequence from top to bottom",
    "local density is a strong function of luminosity .",
    "the most luminous galaxies exist preferentially in the densest regions of the universe .",
    "density increases with luminosity for all absolute magnitudes above @xmath130 . at lower luminosities ,",
    "the local density starts to increase again , which is potentially related to the existence of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in clusters .",
    "this result agrees with results from cfa ( @xcite ) , the optical redshift survey ( hermit96a ) , as well as the recent results of @xcite in the sdss and @xcite in the 2dfgrs on the dependence of the correlation function amplitude on galaxy luminosity .",
    "2 .   highly luminous galaxies are more concentrated , and thus have higher srsic  indices , than lower luminosity galaxies .",
    "this trend is consistent with high luminosity galaxies being preferentially `` early - type . ''",
    "however , even for the highest luminosity galaxies , the de  vaucouleurs profile ( @xmath131 ) is always more concentrated than more than 75% of the galaxies ; the total number density of galaxies with @xmath132 in our absolute magnitude range is @xmath133 .",
    "thus , either the number density fraction of `` true ellipticals '' is small in this absolute magnitude range or many `` true ellipticals '' are not de vaucouleurs profile galaxies . that the srsic  profile in most cases provides a better fit to the surface brightness profiles of morphologically - classified elliptical galaxies than the de  vaucouleurs profile",
    "has been shown previously by several groups ( @xcite ) .",
    "we can try to compare to these results by dividing our sample by color .",
    "figure [ emg_nmgmr ] shows the dependence of @xmath79 on absolute magnitude for three ranges of @xmath64 .",
    "the srsic  index @xmath79 is clearly independent of luminosity for very blue galaxies ( which are close to exponential ) .",
    "for very red galaxies the srsic  index is a strong function of luminosity ( paralleling the dependence of srsic  index on luminosity found by @xcite and @xcite for morphologically elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "luminosity and surface brightness are positively correlated at low luminosities , while at extremely high luminosity surface brightness declines with luminosity .",
    "as we will see below , this occurs because the surface brightnesses of highly concentrated galaxies , which tend to be highly luminous , decline with luminosity , while the surface brightnesses of exponential galaxies , which tend to be low luminosity , increase with luminosity .",
    "note that constant size as a function of surface brightness would be a 45 degree line on the luminosity - surface brightness plot .",
    "at all luminosities , the surface brightness increases more slowly than luminosity , indicating that the median size of galaxies increases strongly with luminosity , especially for the most luminous galaxies .",
    "the colors of galaxies depend strongly on luminosity , in the sense that more luminous galaxies are redder .",
    "the color - magnitude relation is most obvious in @xmath134 , where separate red and blue populations are evident .",
    "this bimodality has also been noted in the observed @xmath135 colors by @xcite and in the d4000 spectroscopic measurements of @xcite .    in short , there are strong dependencies of all parameters on luminosity .",
    "the number density distribution of @xmath79 , the srsic  index , shows a strong peak at @xmath75 in figures [ emg_num ] and [ emg_num_cond ] , indicating that exponential galaxies are extremely common in the universe .",
    "note that there is no peak in the number density at @xmath76 , which corresponds to a de  vaucouleurs profile , indicating that de vaucouleurs galaxies lie along a continuum of galaxy concentration .",
    "naturally , this result is subject to the limitations of our fit  which is based on an azimuthally averaged profile and uses a double gaussian approximation to the seeing .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ test_nfit_plot ] suggests that the effects of inclination are more likely to increase the observed srsic  indices . to test the effects of inclination more empirically",
    ", we can restrict our sample to galaxies which are nearly face on ( axis ratio greater than 0.8 ) , according to the photo pipeline s ab_exp and ab_dev measurements of the best fit axis ratios assuming an exponential or de  vaucouleurs model , respectively .",
    "using either ab_exp or ab_dev as a measure of axis ratio does not lead the srsic  fits to be closer to @xmath76 or for any separate `` concentrated '' peak to appear in the distribution of srsic  index @xmath79 .",
    "similarly , if we restrict our sample to galaxies which have @xmath80 less than @xmath136 ( where @xmath137 is the number of degrees of freedom in the fit ) , we also do nt find any peak at a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "the only subset of galaxies which we have found in our parameter space whose srsic  index even close to `` typically '' @xmath76 are very red ( @xmath138 ) and very luminous ( @xmath139 ) , which one can see in figure [ emg_nmgmr ] ; the actual number of such galaxies is very tiny .",
    "thus , if there is a single parameter one can measure about galaxies which indicates whether it would be classified morphologically as an elliptical , and the typical such elliptical really has @xmath76 , that parameter is not any of those considered here .",
    "the second column from the right in figure [ emg_num_cond ] shows the dependence of each quantity on @xmath79 , the srsic  profile index . from top to bottom :    1 .",
    "local density does not depend on srsic  index as much as it depends on luminosity , although exponential galaxies are in somewhat lower density regions than are concentrated galaxies ( about 25% less overdense ) .",
    "galaxies with @xmath140 have a luminosity function peaked at about @xmath141 .",
    "the peak luminosity declines as the profile shape becomes closer and closer to exponential ( @xmath75 ) , to the extent that it is clear that the peak of the luminosity function for pure exponential galaxies is well below our absolute magnitude limit of @xmath142 . due to these trends ,",
    "the luminosity density distribution of @xmath79 in figure [ emg_lum ] is far flatter than the number density distribution , such that concentrated galaxies contribute a much larger fraction of the luminosity density than they do of the number density ( for a more detailed analysis of this phenomenon , see @xcite ) .",
    "the half - light surface brightnesses of exponential galaxies ( @xmath70 ) are distributed around @xmath143 while the surface brightnesses of concentrated galaxies are centered at much higher surface brightness ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "the galaxies which are nearly exponential tend to be very blue in all colors ( @xmath145 ) . for @xmath132 , galaxies are extremely homogeneous : constant and red colors , constant and high surface brightness , and constant average density .",
    "the third column from the right in figure [ emg_num_cond ] shows the dependence of each quantity on @xmath129 ;    1 .",
    "density is only a weak function of surface brightness on scales of 8 @xmath0 mpc .",
    "note that @xcite investigate the dependence of the correlation function on surface brightness ; they find little dependence on these scales , but a strong dependence on smaller scales .",
    "2 .   paralleling the results for the srsic  index ,",
    "the luminosity function of high surface brightness objects is peaked at high luminosity , while at low surface brightness the luminosity function continues to increase until it passes our low luminosity limit .",
    "this result is similar to that found in sdss commissioning data by @xcite and in the 2dfgrs by @xcite .",
    "the profiles of high surface brightness galaxies are concentrated , while the profiles of most galaxies at lower surface brightness than @xmath146 are consistent with exponential .",
    "the highest surface brightness objects are uniformly red , while fainter than @xmath146 , surface brightness and color are positively correlated  the lower surface brightness a galaxy is , the bluer it tends to be .      the four left columns in figures [ emg_num][emg_num_cond ] show the relation between the four optical colors of galaxies and the other parameters . in figure [ emg_num ] , two distinct peaks in the number density distribution are visible , most notably in the relation between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this result corresponds closely to the work of @xcite , which found a double peaked distribution of ( observer - frame ) @xmath135 color .",
    "the four left columns in figure [ emg_num_cond ] show the dependence of all properties on the colors :    1 .",
    "density is a strong function of all colors .",
    "one expects this trend , based on the separate correlations of galaxy morphological classification with color ( @xcite and references therein ) and environment ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity function of galaxies which have @xmath147 and @xmath148 is peaked at high luminosity ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "the luminosity function of bluer galaxies increases right up to our lower luminosity limit .",
    "redder than @xmath147 or @xmath148 , the peak luminosity declines as well .",
    "this trend indicates that the reddest galaxies are a different population than those right around @xmath147 .",
    "blue galaxies have preferentially exponential profiles .",
    "the concentration of galaxy profiles is highest for galaxies with @xmath147 or @xmath148 ( although , again , the median never reaches @xmath131 ) and declines at redder colors again . again",
    ", this trend suggests that the reddest galaxies are a special population ; in particular , the fact that they tend to have profiles closer to exponential suggests that they are edge - on spiral galaxies reddened by dust . this speculation is supported by the fact that the axial ratios measured by photo for these objects are low ( @xmath150@xmath151 ) .",
    "the half - light surface brightness increases for redder galaxies , again until @xmath147 or @xmath152 , at which point the surface brightness declines again .",
    "this trend may also be partly due to the fact that the reddest galaxies are probably dusty spirals ; however , it is also due to the trend that at the higher luminosities , where galaxy colors are redder , galaxy half - light surface brightnesses tend to get lower with luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the colors are clearly highly correlated among themselves . in particular , measuring @xmath64 constrains the other colors to very small ranges .",
    "we have so far explored only two - dimensional projections of an eight - dimensional space of parameters .",
    "it is interesting to explore a third dimension of this space .",
    "to do so , we divide the galaxies into two groups according to their srsic  index .",
    "we choose an exponential group ( @xmath153 ) and a concentrated group ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "( the results for the intermediate group look like a combination of the contributions from each group separately ) .",
    "figures [ emg_n0_num_cond ] and [ emg_n2_num_cond ] show the conditional distribution of all our galaxy properties on all of the others for the exponential and concentrated groups , respectively .",
    "it is easy to identify which group of galaxies is considered from the panels involving the srsic  index  for example , there is clearly no data for @xmath155 in figure [ emg_n0_num_cond ] .",
    "the diagonal panels in each plot ( which can be inferred from figure [ emg_num ] ) demonstrate that the srsic  index does indeed divide galaxies into red , high surface brightness , luminous galaxies and blue , low surface brightness , underluminous galaxies .",
    "in particular , the luminosity function of the exponential group clearly is rising steeply through our low luminosity limit , while the luminosity function of the concentrated group is peaked at high luminosity .    constrasting the conditional distributions of the exponential group in figure [ emg_n0_num_cond ] to those of the concentrated group in figure [ emg_n2_num_cond ]",
    "reveals that the properties of these populations have very different interrelationships .",
    "most strikingly , the color - magnitude diagrams of these two classes separate extraordinarily well , into a tight red sequence ( probably corresponding closely to the color ",
    "magnitude relation for morphologically elliptical galaxies @xcite ) and a less tight , but undeniable , blue sequence .    similarly , the dependence of surface brightness on luminosity differs markedly for the two classes .",
    "the surface brightness of exponential galaxies increases with luminosity ( as does their size ) , while the surface brightness of concentrated galaxies decreases with their luminosity ( while their size increases even more strongly ) .",
    "another way of looking at the same issue is to consider the dependence of the physical half - light radius on absolute magnitude ; figure [ emg_r50mn ] shows this relationship for three ranges of srsicindex @xmath79 .",
    "again , this figure shows that galaxy size closely correlates with luminosity , with a stronger dependence for de vaucouleurs than for exponential galaxies .",
    "these results are comparable to those in figure 44 of @xcite ; if one simply inverts the slope of the relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath156 ( which yields a correct result if the relationship between the two is sufficiently linear and deterministic ) we find @xmath157 , close to their result .",
    "these results also hold for the dependence of surface brightness on color ; surface brightness correlates with color for exponential galaxies , but peaks at around @xmath158 for concentrated galaxies .",
    "the results for concentrated galaxies are in good agreement with the work of @xcite ( based on morphologically elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "some of the most interesting results from these figures are the dependence of local density on galaxy properties for each type of galaxy profile taken separately .",
    "for example , the local density of exponential galaxies does not depend on surface brightness ; for de vaucouleurs , local density _ decreases _ slightly with surface brightness , a fact probably related to the decrease of luminosity with surface brightness for concentrated galaxies .",
    "it is only that higher surface brightness galaxies are more concentrated , and that concentrated galaxies are on average in higher density regions , that keeps the dependence of density on surface brightness flat for all galaxies .",
    "the dependence of the local density on luminosity has a similar _ shape _ for concentrated galaxies and exponential galaxies , in the range of luminosities in which there is data for both types ( less luminous than about @xmath159 ) .",
    "however , concentrated galaxies are naturally in slightly denser regions at any given luminosity .",
    "meanwhile , for both concentrated and exponential galaxies , density depends strongly on color .",
    "figures [ emg_n0_num_cond ] and [ emg_n2_num_cond ] show that exponential and concentrated galaxies have colors , surface brightnesses , and local densities which are distinct from one another and which depend on galaxy luminosity . to quantify these relations , figure [ cmrplot ]",
    "shows the @xmath104-weighted median properties of both types as the boxes for exponential ( thin lines ) and concentrated ( thick lines ) galaxies ( these lines are just the same as the median lines in figures [ emg_n0_num_cond ] and [ emg_n2_num_cond ] ) .",
    "the statistical uncertainties in the median containing 68% of the probability are shown as vertical lines ( the width of the distribution is of course much larger ) .",
    "we have fit these median relations in the following manner .",
    "first , we add a minimum variance in quadrature to the uncertainties on the points , which is @xmath160 for the colors and surface brightness , and is @xmath161 for density .",
    "we do so in order that our @xmath80 minimization does not obsessively fit the few points with extremely tiny statistical uncertainties ( who could easily be off by a small amount due to systematic errors in the data and our processing ) .",
    "next , we fit a cubic polynomial to the resulting set of points and uncertainties . to be explicit , for property @xmath162 we fit the function @xmath163 where @xmath128 is expressed in absolute magnitudes , the surface brightness is in magnitudes in 1 arcsec@xmath32 , the colors are in magnitudes , and @xmath164 is unitless .",
    "we center the fit at @xmath165 because that is near the center of our luminosity range .",
    "the resulting curves are shown in figure [ cmrplot ] as continuous lines .",
    "they are all reasonable fits to the data over the range we have fit .",
    "the parameters @xmath166 are listed in table [ cmrtable ] for each property and galaxy profile type .",
    "we also list the standard deviations @xmath167 defined by the distribution of galaxies around the best fit curves , both in figure [ cmrplot ] and in table [ cmrtable ] .",
    "however , as can be seen in figures [ emg_n0_num_cond ] and [ emg_n2_num_cond ] , gaussians of constant width are by no means adequate descriptions of the distributions around the median",
    ".    these relations may be useful for comparison to theory or to other observations .",
    "they allow one to predict the median properties of an exponential or concentrated galaxy given only the absolute magnitude .",
    "we caution that because there is significant scatter in all of these relations , one can not reverse _ these _ fits to predict absolute magnitude from other galaxy properties .",
    "the two - dimensional projections of the number and luminosity density data used to create figures [ emg_num ] , [ emg_lum ] , [ emg_nmgmr ] , [ emg_n0_num_cond ] , [ emg_n2_num_cond ] , and [ emg_r50mn ] are available in fits format from the electronic version of this article * [ note to editor : these electronic tables will be required ; for now these can be found at + http://wassup.physics.nyu.edu / manyd / paper/]*.    the fits file each have a single hdu containing three columns and one row .",

    "in this paper , we have presented the number and luminosity density distributions of photometric galaxy properties as measured by the sdss .",
    "galaxy properties are highly correlated . here",
    "are our main conclusions :    1 .",
    "the most luminous galaxies comprise a homogeneous red , highly concentrated , high surface brightness population , and reside in locally dense regions .",
    "underluminous galaxies are less homogeneous , but in general are bluer , less concentrated , lower surface brightness , and reside in less dense regions .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with previous work .",
    "2 .   the relations among galaxy luminosities , surface brightnesses , and colors separate neatly once one has separated them into concentrated and unconcentrated ( exponential ) groups .",
    "some of these relationships are well - known ( such as the color ",
    "magnitude relation of concentrated galaxies ; @xcite ) while others are less commonly discussed ( such as the color ",
    "magnitude relation for exponential galaxies ) .",
    "3 .   local density is a strong function of luminosity , at least for the most luminous galaxies , and on color for galaxies of all colors .",
    "this dependence of clustering on galaxy type has been quantified many times previously , early on in the work of @xcite , later in the cluster studies of @xcite , and also on larger scales by @xcite , and many others .      1 .",
    "optical galaxy colors all correlate very strongly with @xmath134 color .",
    "the distribution of @xmath134 is double - peaked .",
    "most of the luminosity density in the universe is contained in galaxies within our range of galaxy luminosities ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "3 .   the very reddest galaxies ( which are small in number ) are in optical colors exponential galaxies , not concentrated galaxies .",
    "4 .   for all types of galaxies , size increases with luminosity . for concentrated galaxies , surface brightness decreases with luminosity for the most luminous galaxies . for exponential galaxies ,",
    "surface brightness increases with luminosity .",
    "simple quantitative expressions of some of these results are contained in the parametric fits to the conditional distributions of figure [ cmrplot ] and table [ cmrtable ] as well as the two - dimensional projections given in the associated electronic tables .",
    "however , in future work we may characterize the distribution using a full seven - dimensional model of the distribution of properties .    a potentially important effect to account for in future analyses is the passive evolution of galaxy luminosities",
    ". measurements of this evolution in the sdss suggest that galaxy luminosities are brighter in the past ( a trend of @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 magnitudes per unit redshift in the @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath125 , and @xmath185 bands ) .",
    "while the difference in absolute magnitude over the whole redshift range is quite small ( 0.3 magnitudes ) compared to the dynamic range in @xmath20-band absolute magnitude , some of the colors may be affected significantly . because the survey is flux limited",
    ", this effect can , in principle , alter the slope of our measurement of the color - magnitude relationship .",
    "for the trends quoted here , accounting for evolution would make the measured slope steeper , because the high luminosity galaxies are observed primarily at high redshift , and are observed to be bluer than they would be at the lower redshifts of the lower luminosity galaxies to which we are comparing them .",
    "for example , @xcite have found such evolution of the @xmath186 color  magnitude diagram in their early - type galaxy sdss sample ( their figure 24 ) .",
    "we note that one can detect the effect of not accounting for evolution by comparing the results of blanton et al .",
    "( in preparation ) for the evolution - corrected luminosity function at @xmath56 to the @xmath187-based estimate of the @xmath20-band luminosity function presented here ( our luminosity function extends to slightly higher luminosities than that estimate ) .    the scope of this paper has not allowed us to delve into a more detailed discussion of the individual relationships and their relation to galaxy formation theory .",
    "however , we could not do justice to these topics in the space and time available here , and leave this for the future , encouraging readers to use the data distributed here to perform similar work .",
    "we note that @xcite have performed a similar analysis using fits to stellar population models .",
    "they also see bimodality in the distribution of galaxy properties , particular in their measure of the 4000   break .",
    "in addition , they find that because their estimated mass - to - light ratio ( in their case in the @xmath21-band ) is a strong ( and increasing ) function of mass or luminosity , the dependence of surface mass density in a galaxy on total stellar mass is monotonic , even though the dependence of surface brightness on luminosity shows a maximum surface brightness at around an absolute magnitude of @xmath188",
    ". a particularly interesting application along these lines would be to consider the dependence of local density on stellar mass .",
    "two important photometric parameters missing from this space are color gradients and axis ratios .",
    "as it turns out , the color gradients of galaxies in our sample are usually quite small , partly because the central bulges of our spiral galaxies are blurred with the disks by seeing .",
    "nevertheless , using a restricted sample of nearby galaxies , one can characterize this distribution .",
    "the distribution of axis ratios is related to the three - dimensional shape of the galaxy , so understanding the conditional distribution of this quantity on other parameters will yield a better understanding of galaxy geometry .",
    "preliminary tests have shown that the axis ratios of our red , concentrated objects tend to be close to unity , whereas the axis ratios of blue , unconcentrated objects tend to differ significantly from unity , agreeing with the common understanding of the nature of elliptical and spiral galaxies . including a characterization of the two - dimensional shape of each galaxy would be an interesting way to expand the results found here .",
    "we began this paper by noting that many galaxy properties have been known for decades to be correlated , and in particular to be correlated with position on the hubble sequence .",
    "many readers will ask how galaxies of different morpholopgical classifications are distributed in this space , a question we could address using a nearby subsample of the galaxies studied here .",
    "we have not done so here because we believe that morphological classification is not a sufficiently specified measurement to be straightforwardly interpreted .",
    "the position along the hubble sequence is determined by most galaxy classifiers from a consideration of a galaxy s surface brightness , smoothness , concentration , axis ratio , the prominence of dust lanes , and spiral arm pitch angle . however , astronomy has not standardized the weights to be accorded by the classifier to each of these qualities of a galaxy image when placing each galaxy along the one - dimensional hubble sequence . in addition",
    ", the decision about a galaxy s classification is highly dependent on the observing conditions , especially the distance of the galaxy from the observer , the dynamic range of the image , the passband of the observation , and the angle from which the galaxy is observed .",
    "even when considering a single image and allowing only the classifier to vary , the repeatability of classification appears to be low ( @xmath189 in units of revised hubble @xmath190 type ; @xcite ) .",
    "even this level of repeatability is not clearly due to the fact that classifiers all weight the various hubble type criteria similarly , since the properties under consideration all correlate .",
    "nevertheless , as reviewed by @xcite , morphological classification is clearly important , since it does correlate with many physical properties of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we _ can _ specify certain aspects which determine morphological classification .",
    "for example , many investigators have quantified measures of surface brightness , concentration , smoothness / blobbiness ( e.g. @xcite ) , and lopsidedness ( e.g. @xcite ) , among others , and investigated the dependence of these measures on observing conditions .",
    "these efforts , of which this paper is a part , are forming a new approach to quantitative morphology that we hope will have a more direct and better specified connection to theoretical predictions .",

    "<S> using photometry and spectroscopy of 144,609 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey , we present bivariate distributions of pairs of seven galaxy properties : four optical colors , surface brightness , radial profile shape as measured by the srsic  index , and absolute magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we present the dependence of local galaxy density ( smoothed on 8 @xmath0 mpc scales ) on all of these properties . </S>",
    "<S> several classic , well - known relations among galaxy properties are evident at extremely high signal - to - noise ratio : the color  color relations of galaxies , the color  magnitude relations , the magnitude  surface brightness relation , and the dependence of density on color and absolute magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we show that most of the @xmath1-band luminosity density in the universe is in the absolute magnitude and surface brightness ranges used : @xmath2 and @xmath3 in @xmath4 ( the notation @xmath5 represents the @xmath6 band shifted blueward by a factor @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> some of the relationships between parameters , in particular the color  magnitude relations , show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a simple set of fits of the dependence of galaxy properties on luminosity for these two sets of galaxies . </S>"
