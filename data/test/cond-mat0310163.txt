    "# 1#2#1 the renormalization group ( rg ) theory @xcite has long been accepted as the basis of our understanding of critical phenomena due to its ability to deal with the problem of fluctuations on a wide range of length scales and to realistically predict many quantities of experimental interest .",
    "however , it is well known that precise quantitative predictions with correspondingly accurate experimental tests are few .",
    "essentially all tests performed near gas - liquid critical points are unable to give detailed attention to the asymptotic region close to the phase transition , where the rg predictions are simplified and best established .",
    "severe difficulties are encountered here due to transition broadening associated with gravity and relaxation phenomena , limiting the useful temperature range for tests of the theory .",
    "for example , near the critical point of a 1 mm high sample of xenon , density gradients cause substantial distortion of the singularity for reduced temperatures , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and t@xmath8 is the transition temperature.@xcite this results in the observation of effective exponents which are perturbed from their asymptotic values by higher order terms , providing only weak support for the theory . to avoid this problem some experiments",
    "have been performed in space .",
    "for example , recent measurements @xcite of the specific heat of sf@xmath9 have extended about an order of magnitude closer to the transition than ground based experiments .",
    "@xcite relaxation phenomena now appear to inhibit further gains .",
    "in contrast , at the lambda point of helium , the transition between he i and he ii , a much wider range of @xmath5 is accessible . on earth values of @xmath10",
    "can typically be reached @xcite before finite size effects become the limiting factor .",
    "this has resulted in the lambda transition becoming the premier testing ground for the rg theory of second order transitions . in space",
    ", the lambda transition is expected to be sharp to @xmath11 in ideal conditions .",
    "@xcite here the challenge is more to develop a measurement technique than to obtain a suitable sample .",
    "recently , improved predictions have been derived for a number of universal quantities of three dimensional critical systems .",
    "@xcite these predictions now approach the accuracy of the corresponding experimental observations near the lambda point .",
    "this advance has uncovered a small but not entirely negligible discrepancy between the heat capacity exponent , @xmath12 , measured in a space experiment conducted in 1992 @xcite and the most recent predictions . since this comparison currently represents one of the core tests of the rg theory , we have completed a more detailed analysis of the experiment with the aim of reducing systematic bias in the results as much as possible .",
    "we have also included additional measurements that were rejected earlier due to uncertainties in their calibration .",
    "the results of this analysis are presented here , along with a detailed report on the significant aspects of the experiment .",
    "we now find better agreement with the predictions than previously .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     taking into account the effects of the various constraints",
    "it appears that the flight results indicate @xmath13 and a@xmath2/a@xmath14 with a high degree of confidence .",
    "these values can be compared with the theoretical estimates given in table i. it can be seen that our result for @xmath12 falls between the two recent estimates , giving us confidence in the overall correctness of the rg approach . if the discrepancy between the two estimates can be resolved , a very high quality test of the theory would result .",
    "it is interesting to note that our result falls very close to the value -0.01294 @xmath15 0.0006 obtained earlier by kleinert .",
    "@xcite this suggests that the earlier method of resumming the perturbation expansion may be more reliable than the more recent one .",
    "@xcite    the value we obtain for the ratio a@xmath2/a@xmath3 can be compared with the calculation of strsser , mnnigmann and dohm @xcite who s result for @xmath16 implies a@xmath2/a@xmath17 if @xmath18 . for the value of @xmath16 itself ,",
    "we obtain @xmath19 where the uncertainty is the @xmath20 statistical value including the effects of correlations of the parameters .",
    "this compares well with the strsser et al .",
    "result of @xmath21 .",
    "very recently , strsser and dohm @xcite have obtained the improved result @xmath22 from a 4-loop analytic calculation . on the experimental side , g. ahlers",
    "has informed us @xcite that his data @xcite are consistent with @xmath23 , quite close to the present measurement .",
    "we note that the value of p is dependent on the heat capacity behavior above t@xmath24 which is not very well established in our experiment .",
    "a value of @xmath16 can also be derived from the data of lipa and chui .",
    "@xcite from their published analysis , which did not constrain b@xmath2 = b@xmath3 , we obtain @xmath25 .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath16 and its uncertainty are significantly affected by the fitting constraint b@xmath2 = b@xmath3 .",
    "this appears to be a result of the strong correlations between a@xmath2 and b@xmath2 and a@xmath3 and b@xmath3 in the curve fitting .",
    "if this constraint is added to the analysis of ref .",
    "5 we obtain @xmath16 = 3.98 @xmath15 0.02 .",
    "more work would be valuable to determine an accurate value of p.    the quality of the fit to the model can be seen in fig .",
    "18 where the residuals from eq.(9 ) are shown below the transition .",
    "part ( a ) shows the bin - averaged results over the full range measured , and part ( b ) shows the individual measurements in the range @xmath26 .",
    "the bin density was 10 per decade , evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the parameters of the reference function are given in line 1 of table ii .",
    "little curvature in the deviations at large @xmath27 is evident , indicating residual effects from the truncation of the fitting function and from the calibration approximations are small .",
    "the deviation plot also shows that there is no indication of rounding from gravity or finite size effects near the transition .",
    "an estimate of the effect of the surface specific heat is shown by the broken curve .",
    "this result extends the agreement with the predicted behavior two orders of magnitude closer to the transition than previously .    a : deviations of the bin averaged flight data from the best fit function vs reduced temperature on a semi - logarithmic scale below the transition .",
    "dashed line : estimated surface specific heat term .",
    "b : magnified view of deviations of individual measurements for @xmath26 . ]    the results given here for @xmath12 and a@xmath2/a@xmath3 differ somewhat from those quoted in our preliminary analysis @xcite after correction for a computational error . @xcite apart from the addition of the high power pulse data the main differences between the two analyses are improved modeling of the hrt calibrations and the power dependence of the heat capacity .",
    "additional analysis has shown that approximately @xmath28 of the change in @xmath12 is due to the improved calibration function in eq.(5 ) .",
    "given the small change of @xmath12 that has resulted from this additional work , we have confidence that systematic effects are now well controlled and the present results are quite robust relative to alternative treatments of the raw measurements .",
    "we can use our result for @xmath12 to perform a test of the josephson scaling relation @xmath29 . using the result of goldner",
    "et al @xcite for @xmath30 we obtain @xmath31 where the errors have been combined in quadrature .",
    "the agreement with the prediction is very good .",
    "somewhat worse agreement is obtained if we use the result of adriaans @xcite which leads to @xmath32 .",
    "we note that in both these experiments , the plots of deviations of the measurements from the fits show systematic departures , indicating that the error bars quoted may be optimistic .",
    "we also note that our results are in good agreement with the expected behavior based on vortex - ring rg theory .",
    "@xcite      a secondary goal of the experiment was to obtain thermal conductivity results in the normal phase of helium above t@xmath33 .",
    "as described in section vi - b , a series of time constants is derived from the fit to the thermal relaxation transient after a heat pulse .",
    "the thermal conductivity is inversely proportional to @xmath34 and can therefore be output as part of the heat pulse analysis .",
    "as expected , we observe that the time constant of the decay is shortest near t@xmath33 ( @xmath35 few seconds ) and grows as the temperature rises .",
    "very near t@xmath33 where the pulse size is small , the transient is difficult to analyze : the small amplitude and short time constant are masked by the hrt noise , especially by the larger cosmic ray spikes which look very similar .",
    "this limited our analysis of @xmath34 to @xmath36 .",
    "the results for the thermal conductivity are shown in fig .",
    "19 after being binned at a density of 5 bins per decade of @xmath27 .",
    "for comparison we show some results obtained in a ground experiment that covers part of the region .",
    "@xcite also shown is the behavior predicted by dohm @xcite using rg techniques .",
    "it can be seen that there is good agreement between the two sets of data and the theoretical model .",
    "@xcite    log - log plot of thermal conductivity vs reduced temperature above the lambda point .",
    "filled circles : present work ; @xmath37 : lipa and li ; @xcite curve : model of dohm .",
    "@xcite ]    deviations of various data sets from the best fit function vs reduced temperature on a logarithmic scale , below the transition .",
    "a : buckingham , fairbank and kellers ; @xcite b : ahlers ; @xcite c : gasparini and moldover ; @xcite d : takada and watanabe @xcite and e : lipa and chui .",
    "@xcite ]      in fig .",
    "20 we show the deviations of other sets of data from our best fit to eq.(9 ) .",
    "the data of lipa and chui @xcite were obtained with a 3 mm high cell and that of ahlers @xcite with a 1.59 cm high cell .",
    "although it is possible to correct for the effects of gravity , it can be seen that in the ground experiments the corrections become quite large near the transition , limiting access to the transition region . in fig .",
    "20(a , c , d ) we show the deviations of other reported results @xcite from the same function .",
    "it can be seen that there is reasonably good agreement between the various data sets , but occasionally the deviations are outside the noise of the data",
    ". some of the discrepancies may be due to the use of earlier temperature scales , but it is unlikely that this effect contributes more than @xmath38 to the deviations .",
    "the significant improvement in scatter of the new data for @xmath26 can be attributed to the use of the hrts and a larger sample ( @xmath39 moles ) .",
    "the larger sample size does not directly improve the signal to noise of a heat capacity measurement , instead it attenuates the variations in the external heat leaks , leading to more accurate extrapolations to the center of a pulse .",
    "in summary , our primary result is a new value of the exponent @xmath12 describing the divergence of the specific heat below the lambda - transition of helium with a reduced systematic uncertainty .",
    "this value is in good agreement with estimates based on rg calculations and is also in reasonable agreement with the value expected from superfluid density data via the josephson scaling relation .",
    "our result for the ratio a@xmath2/a@xmath3 is also in good agreement with recent estimates .",
    "thermal conductivity measurements derived from the relaxation data are in reasonable agreement with steady state measurements further from the transition and with theoretical predictions .",
    "this gives us additional confidence in the current model of second order transitions , and in the use of the results for other analyses .",
    "other aspects of the rg theory , predicting the properties of condensed matter in general , need to be examined on their merits , but it is clear that the underlying principles are capable of explaining a wide range of properties of ordinary matter .",
    "we note that the reduction of the thermometer noise caused by cosmic rays that was demonstrated on a more recent mission @xcite coupled with continuing advances in thermometry @xcite opens up the possibility of further substantial reductions in the uncertainty of @xmath12 in future experiments .",
    "we wish to thank the nasa office of biological and physical research for its generous support with contract @xmath40jpl - 957448 , and dr .",
    "m. lee for his long term support of the program .",
    "we greatly appreciate the support of the lpe teams at stanford and jpl , and the services of the ksc and msfc mission support teams .",
    "we also thank ball aerospace for extensive support with the development of the flight hardware , and especially g. mills for the fabrication of the calorimeter .",
