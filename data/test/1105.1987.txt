    "in the context of spacetimes that admit spatially compact spacelike cauchy hypersurfaces , hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature ( cmc ) and slicings by such hypersurfaces have attracted a lot of attention .",
    "one major motivation for studying such slicings rests on the fact that cmc foliations give rise to a geometrically distinguished time - function on the spacetime .",
    "cmc slicings thus appear prominently whenever cosmological spacetimes are discussed , when the strong cosmic censorship conjecture is investigated , and they also play an important role in numerical studies .    there",
    "exist several well - established properties of cmc hypersurfaces in cosmological spacetimes satisfying the timelike convergence condition ( which is identical to the strong energy condition and states that the contraction of the ricci tensor with any timelike vector is non - negative ) . in particular , uniqueness of cmc hypersurfaces is well - understood : in a cosmological spacetime satisfying the timelike convergence condition , for any given constant @xmath0 , there exists at most one compact cmc hypersurface with mean curvature @xmath1 ; the proof in  @xcite is based on the techniques of  @xcite .",
    "modulo some subtleties , an analogous result holds for maximal hypersurfaces ( where @xmath2 ) .",
    "a consequence of the uniqueness result is that any killing vector the spacetime possesses must be tangential to the cmc hypersurface .",
    "the existence of compact cmc hypersurfaces ( and foliations thereof ) is a more delicate issue .",
    "( if there exists one compact cmc hypersurface , then there exists a foliation of a neighborhood of that hypersurface by compact cmc hypersurfaces .",

    "there exist examples of spacetimes with a cmc foliation that is not global  @xcite and spacetimes that do not possess compact cmc hypersurfaces at all  @xcite .",
    "the failure of the conjecture can not be attributed to the presence of matter , since there exist vacuum cosmological spacetimes without compact cmc hypersurfaces as well  @xcite .    without the assumption of the timelike convergence condition ,",
    "fewer results are available : uniqueness of a globally defined cmc time function with compact level sets still holds  @xcite ( and the associated cmc foliation is the unique cmc foliation ) . in",

    "existence of a cmc foliation can be deduced from the existence of barriers  @xcite : if the spacetime possesses a future crushing singularity ( future mean curvature barrier ) , then a future end of the spacetime admits a cmc foliation , where the range of the mean curvature is a subset of the interval @xmath18 .",

    "this is not true in general .",
    "we show that , on the one hand , there are kantowski - sachs spacetimes with a unique global cmc foliation ( which does , however , not define a time function ) ; on the other hand , there are kantowski - sachs spacetimes containing ( arbitrarily ) many families of cmc slicings , where the range of @xmath26 is @xmath27 ( with ) . in the future ` end ' of the spacetime ,",
