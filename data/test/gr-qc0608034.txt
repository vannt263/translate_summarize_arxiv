    "the limit of no string is actually realized by a contraction of a domain around the string in which the field is suppressed . for @xmath3 close to @xmath160",
    "the domain of vanishing electric field is rather small .",
    "it is nontrivial only for @xmath166 ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : maglines].,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the behavior of the field can be also rephrased as a nonexistence of a homogeneous electric or magnetic field perpendicular to the cosmic string .",
    "indeed , in empty minkowski spacetime the homogeneous electric field can be constructed as a field of a large charge at large distances .",
    "as we have seen , in the spacetime of cosmic string the field of the charge located at large distances from the string is suppressed and there is thus no analogue of the homogeneous field perpendicular to the string .",
    "the same result can be obtained also by studying a general static field around the string ( i.e. , by a direct solution of the homogeneous laplace equation in the space with a deficit angle ) @xcite .",
    "we have discussed the electromagnetic field in the spacetime of a cosmic string . the retarded green function for the vector potential was found .",
    "it can be split into a part corresponding to the empty space propagation of the field , and into a part corresponding to scattering on the curvature located within the string .    using this green function electric and magnetic fields of various simple static sources were constructed .",
    "it was demonstrated that although the spacetime is locally flat ( outside the string ) , the global deficit angle causes several interesting phenomena .",
    "we found a self - interaction of the point charge ( repulsive away from the string ) , of the dipole ( turning the dipole into the @xmath171 direction the string ) , or of the line current ( attractive toward the string ) .",
    "in general , the self - interaction of charges and currents near the string implies that the string participates on electromagnetic processes even if it is not charged itself .",
    "it can have consequences when studying the motion of cosmic strings through , e.g. , ionised plasma in an early universe .",
    "further , we found that the field of a static source at large distances has a different multipole structure , namely , there is no dipole term corresponding to the dipole perpendicular to the string .",
    "near the string , the electric and magnetic fields orthogonal to the string are suppressed .",
    "for the same reason , there exists no homogeneous static field perpendicular to the string .",
    "most of the discussed effects can easily be understood in the special case @xmath172 ( respectively , for @xmath3 being any integer ) . in this case",
    "the scattered part of the field vanishes and the resulting field can be obtained as the field in the half of minkowski spacetime given by the real source and by a fictitious source obtained as a reflection of the real source with respect to the axis ( these two contributions correspond to different terms in the sum over geodetics in ) .",
    "the self - interaction is thus given by the interaction of the real and the fictitious sources .",
    "a suppression of the dipole field at large distances arises because a combination of the dipole ( orthogonal to the string ) and of its reflected image gives a quadrupole configuration . and",
    "finally , the expulsion of the field away from the string arises as a cancelation of the fields of the source and of its image in middle between them .    after deriving the general form of the green function we concentrated mainly on static phenomena . as a next step it would be interesting to study similar questions in dynamical contexts ; for example , the scattering of plane waves on the string or the field of a strong oscillating dipole located far from the string .",

    "bik for arranging this stay and for reading both @xcite and the manuscript of this paper .",
    "in this appendix we evaluate the integral .",
    "the choice of the integration contour in the complex plane of @xmath46 guarantees that the integral is vanishing for @xmath173 . for @xmath174 we can close the contour in the upper half of the complex plane and the integration over @xmath46 leads to residues at simple poles @xmath47 .",

    "in the main text we need to evaluate integrals @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 , @xmath202 .",
    "we first note that conditions are equivalent to the conditions @xmath203 where , similarly to @xmath204 and @xmath61 , we do not write the dependence of @xmath205 and @xmath206 on @xmath62 explicitly . with such",
