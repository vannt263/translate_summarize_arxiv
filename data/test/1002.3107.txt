    "historically , images of the sun have always presented a myriad of features far in advance of our physical understanding of their existence and evolution .",
    "new data with increased sensitivity , spatial- and temporal - resolution are continually challenging our theoretical models of the solar atmosphere .",
    "this general statement is especially true in the case of coronal loops as observed by the fleet of extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) imagers launched since the mid 1990s . beginning with the _ extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope _",
    "( eit : ) , this list includes the _ transition region and coronal explorer _ ( trace : ) and recently the _ extreme ultraviolet imager _ ( euvi ; ) onboard the twin _ solar terrestrial earth relations observatory _",
    "( stereo : ) spacecraft . from these data ,",
    "our current models suggest these coronal loops trace out hot coronal plasma ( @xmath01mk ) up to heights of around 50 mm above the surface of the sun , but questions remain over their temperature and density profile , temporal evolution , and 3d structure .",
    "studies of these open questions are limited by the ability to extract the loop system of interest from the hundreds of others typically present in a solar euv image .",
    "furthermore each individual loop as viewed by any current instrument is probably a collection of multiple strands , and there will be any number of these strands overlapping along the instrument line of sight . with the launch of stereo , solar physicists can now view the corona from multiple angles , enabling the 3d reconstruction of coronal loops to try to overcome this problem . the largest problem in this reconstruction",
    "is the identification of the same feature from each spacecraft . in the ideal world",
    ", the same feature would be tracked in image sequences as observed from each spacecraft and the 3d reconstruction would become a mathematically simple problem .",
    "this would enable the scientist to proceed with studying the physical parameter of interest .",
    "ideally this extraction should be automated in order to make the process instantly repeatable . from these issues , there arises a natural requirement for the automated detection of loops based on a statistical approach . additionally , and perhaps most pressing , the expected data load from the _ solar dynamics observatory _",
    "( sdo ) will be overwhelming without automated feature recognition ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "describe five such feature - recognition algorithms for coronal - loop identification and apply each algorithm to an example image from trace .",
    "this technique of comparing algorithms to each other , as well as to some ground truth , is the best method for rigorous testing of any feature recognition algorithm . in this paper",
    "we apply a sixth such technique to the same trace image as described in section  [ obs ] .",
    "the algorithm is described in detail in section  [ methods ] .",
    "the technique is called the 2d wavelet - transform modulus maxima ( wtmm ) method and was originally developed by arneodo and colleagues as a multifractal analysis formalism @xcite .",
    "it has been expanded to characterize the anisotropic nature of complex structures @xcite and also to perform an automated and objective segmentation of image features of interest from a noisy background @xcite . in solar physics ,",
    "the technique has been used recently to study the complexity of solar active region magnetic fields (;",
    ", @xcite ; ; ) , x - ray solar - flare emission @xcite , and in tracking coronal mass ejections @xcite . in section  [ res ]",
    "we explain the natural advantages of applying this to coronal - loop identification and compare the global statistics against those identified in .",
    "finally , in section  [ conc ] we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the wtmm algorithm and suggest future extensions .",
    "in order to directly compare our results to those previously published , we have tested our algorithm on the same sub - image as in .",
    "this image was observed on 19 may 1998 , 22:21:43 ut , with an exposure time of 23.172 seconds with a passband centered on 171 . the data were de - biased , flat - fielded , and de - spiked to remove cosmic - ray spikes from the image .",
    "the resulting image is shown with our identified loops in figure  [ overlay ] and presents three of the main problems with detecting coronal loops : firstly , they are curvi - linear structures : point sources , straight lines , and areas are well behaved in the [ _ x , y _ ] ccd plane ; curves are much more difficult .",
    "secondly , many of the loops rise almost vertically through the solar atmosphere .",
    "the rapid density drop off in the corona ( with a scale height of about 50 mm ) results in a distinct lack of loop tops along many of these features .",
    "this makes it difficult to track from footpoint to footpoint .",
    "thirdly there is a collection of small - scale features near the bunch of footpoints , which are typically not of interest in studies of coronal loop systems .",
    "our method of coronal loop identification is based on the 2d wavelet transform modulus maxima method .",
    "the continuous nature of the wavelet transform allows us to scan all size scales continuously in order to take full advantage of the space - scale information available .",
    "this allows us to perform the segmentation of objects of interest in total objectivity , without any prior knowledge on the size or morphology of the objects .",
    "image segmentation with continuous wavelets is based on the derivative of a 2d smoothing function ( filter ) acting as an `` edge detector '' .",
    "let us consider two wavelets that are , respectively , the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath2 of a 2d smoothing ( gaussian ) function , @xmath3 namely @xmath4    for any function @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 consists of all square - integrable functions ) , the continuous wavelet transform of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath8 and @xmath9 is expressed as a vector @xcite : @xmath10({\\bf b},a ) = \\cr \\bigg ( \\matrix {    t_{\\psi_1}[f ] = a^{-2 } \\int \\mathrm{d}^2 { \\bf x }   \\ ; \\psi_1 \\big(a^{-1}({\\bf x } -    { \\bf b})\\big ) f({\\bf x } ) \\cr t_{\\psi_2}[f ] = a^{-2 } \\int \\mathrm{d}^2 { \\bf x } \\ ;    \\psi_2 \\big(a^{-1}({\\bf x } - { \\bf b})\\big ) f({\\bf x } ) } \\bigg ) \\cr = \\nabla \\ { t_{\\phi_{\\rm gau}}[f]({\\bf b},a)\\ }   = \\nabla \\ { \\phi_{{\\rm gau } , { \\bf b } , a } * f \\}. } \\label{tpsi}\\ ] ]    thus , equation ( [ tpsi ] ) amounts to defining the 2d wavelet transform as the gradient vector of @xmath11 smoothed by dilated versions @xmath12 of the gaussian filter .",
    "the wavelet transform can be written in terms of its modulus , @xmath13({\\bf b } , a)$ ] and argument , @xmath14({\\bf b } , a)$ ] @xmath15({\\bf b } , a ) = \\sqrt{\\big(t_{\\psi1}[f]({\\bf b},a)\\big)^2 + \\big(t_{\\psi2}[f]({\\bf b},a)\\big)^2 } ,    \\label{modulus}\\ ] ]    @xmath16({\\bf b } , a ) = { \\bf arg } \\big(t_{\\psi1}[f]({\\bf b},a ) + \\mathrm{i}t_{\\psi2}[f]({\\bf b},a)\\big ) .",
    "\\label{argument}\\ ] ]    the modulus maxima of the wavelet - transform , or intensity gradient maxima , are defined by the positions where the modulus of the wavelet transform , @xmath17({\\bf b } , a)$ ] , _",
    "i.e. , _ the gradient , is locally maximal .",
    "these wtmm are automatically organized as maxima chains which act as contour lines of the smoothed image at the considered scales .",
    "this is a non - trivial process , which has been discussed and solved empirically by . at a given scale ,",
    "the algorithm scans all the boundary lines that correspond to the highest values of the gradient , _",
    "i.e. , _ the maxima chains . for each size scale considered , the algorithm outputs the [ _ x , y _ ] pixel location chain of each edge detected .",
    "each chain then corresponds to a single extracted edge in the image .",
    "we identify each edge as a single coronal loop , as shown in figure  [ overlay ] .",
    "this process is repeated continuously at all scales .",
    "futher detail on the actual code is given in the appendix .",
    "in this section we describe the nature of the wtmm method to trace out and connect edges as one of the major advantages of this method .",
    "we compare automatically detected loops against those manually identified in . in order to quantitatively compare this technique against those previously published",
    "we also collate a number of global image statistics : the total number of loops detected is an indication of the completeness of the algorithm : the maximum loop length is an indication of the upper limit on the detection : the scaling index of the cumulative distribution shows how the algorithm performs across size scales .      figure  [ fig4]a shows an individual loop corresponding to one of the large complete coronal loops near the center of the image . the modulus and angle information used to detect this loop",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig4]b with the same color scale as figure  [ fig4]a . as the loop is traced from one footpoint to the other , both the modulus and angle information change smoothly .",
    "the modulus is strongest at the footpoints ( where the intensity in the original image is strongest ) and drops off by a factor of five at the loop tops .",
    "the angle starts off at @xmath18 at the right  most footpoint ( _ i.e. , _ pointing to the right of the image , along the _ x _ -axis ) , increases to @xmath19 at the loop top ( _ i.e. , _ pointing straight up along the _ y _ -axis ) , and increases to @xmath20 at the second footprint ( _ i.e. , _ pointing to the left , along the _ x _ -axis ) .",
    "it is not a completely smooth transition ; this is most evident at the loop top , where the angle varies more rapidly .",
    "this variation of angle and modulus hence provides two parameters for loop identification .",
    "most importantly , although the modulus may drop off dramatically at the loop top ( a manifestation of the decreased signal ) , the variation in angle is much smoother .",
    "a second example , for tracing a partial loop , is displayed in figure  [ fig5 ] for a loop leg in the lower right of the image . in this case",
    ", the angle stays constant ( @xmath21 ) along the leg , while the modulus drops off with increasing distance from the footpoint .",
    "a more detailed analysis of extracted loops can be carried out by comparing the edges against those loop manually identified in .",
    "figure  [ loop3 ] shows such a comparison for two subimages of the data .",
    "these regions are picked as they illustrate two important spatial regimes of loop identification and demonstrate some of the main positive aspects and drawbacks of the wtmm method .",
    "figure  [ loop3 ] ( top ) contains a bunch of loop legs .",
    "these are mostly linear and display a relatively constant intensity along each loop inside this window .",
    "these two aspects should make these features easier to detect however none of the wtmm scales completely extract the manual coordinates .",
    "each of the scales displayed pick out seven  eight of thirteen manually detected loops . the largest scale displayed ( scale 12 ; right column ) is unable to pick out any of the weaker , shorter",
    ", loops however does produce smooth edges .",
    "the smallest scale ( scale 2 ; middle column ) identifies more of the smaller loops , but at the expense of producing a more ragged edge .",
    "scale 6 still contains many of small loops , but also produces a smooth edge .",
    "scale 6 is also the only scale which captures the loops in the bottom right of this subimage .",
    "figure  [ loop3 ] ( bottom ) shows a selection of the curvi - linear features . as these",
    "are curves in [ _ x , y _ ] pixel space and show a drop in intensity , they are normally more difficult to extract . however the ability of the wtmm method to chain in angle space assists in overcoming this problem .",
    "of the seven curved , manually - detected features , each scale reproduces four  five .",
    "the large , but weak , loop near the center of the subimage is not detected at any scale .",
    "the wavelet transform power lies below the threshold for idenfication .",
    "lowering our threshold to extract this loop results in pulling out an unmanageable number of weak non - loop features .",
    "scale 2 and scale 6 are similar ; the main difference is the ability of scale 6 to begin to detect the loop in the top left . at scale 12 , the smoothing window is so large that the tracking algorithm jumps from one large loop to a second large loop .",
    "clearly there is a trade off to be made between completeness and quality of extracted edges .      .",
    "[ fig2 ]    a full quantitative comparison of the positive and negatives of each scale is best achieved by comparing the global statistics .",
    "the total number of detected loops and maximum loop length at each wavelet scale size is displayed in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the bottom axis shows the wavelet scale , with the corresponding scale in pixels displayed on the top axis .",
    "the solid line shows how the total number of loops greater than @xmath22 pixels ( left axis ) varies with each wavelet scale size .",
    "the horizontal solid line shows the ground truth ( _ i.e. , _ manually extracted ) of @xmath23 .",
    "it is clear that the wavelet algorithm consistently underperforms , but it is noticeable that the plot peaks at scale size @xmath24 . at this scale",
    "we can reach a completeness ratio of @xmath25 .",
    "the dashed line shows how the maximum loop length ( right axis ) varies with each scale size .",
    "the horizontal dashed line shows the ground truth ( _ i.e. , _ manually extracted ) value of @xmath26 .",
    "as expected , the ability of the algorithm to detect the largest loops increases with increased wavelet scale size .",
    "it underperforms at small scale size , and over - detects larger structures at large scales sizes .",
    "the best performance is also at wavelet scale 6 , where we reach a detection ratio of @xmath27 .",
    "it is comforting to note that we achieve maximum accuracy and completeness in these two parameters at the same scale size .",
    "the cumulative distribution of loops with length greater than 70 pixels is displayed in figure  [ fig3 ] for scale 6 ( @xmath28 pixels ) .",
    "the scaling index ( @xmath29 ) of this plot is indicative of the distribution of loop lengths in the image and reflects the tendency of smaller loops of naturally outnumber larger loops .",
    "report a ground truth of @xmath30 for the manually traced loops , with the five algorithms producing values between -2.0 and -3.2 .",
    "for the wtmm algorithm in figure  [ fig3 ] , @xmath31 .",
    "euv images of the corona provide a multitude of information regarding the plasma properties of coronal loop systems .",
    "a number of algorithms currently exist that attempt to extract the locations of these loops automatically .",
    "these algorithms are discussed in detail in but here we compare a brief outline of each one against our wtmm method .    the oriented connectivity method ( ocm : @xcite , @xcite ) consists of a preprocessing step to remove non - loop candidates , a linkage step based on magnetic - field extrapolation guide , and post - processing to spline fit and link loop segments . the dynamic aperture - based loop segmentation method ( dam : @xcite , @xcite )",
    "replaces the linkage step of the ocm with a search for loops by connecting pixels which have a similar gaussian cross sectional profile @xcite and orientation .",
    "the oriented - directivity loop tracing method ( odm : @xcite , @xcite ) is essentially a local - directivity version of the ocm , tracing loops locally in two directions from their tops to their footpoints .",
    "the ridge detection by automated scaling ( ras : @xcite , @xcite ) is is a multiscale ridgel extension of the ocm .",
    "finally , the unbiased detection of curvi - linear structures ( udm : @xcite , @xcite ) is a more generic method consisting the determination of the centroid of the loop structures from a second derivative perpendicular to the loop , and extended @xcite to connect structrues using a generalised radon transform .",
    "show that the ocm and dam both successfully extract the large loop features .",
    "the odm , ras , and udm codes contain many more free parameters and extracted more segmented small loop - like features .",
    "the wtmm method presented here offers many natural advantages over other techniques : firstly , it has naturally directional linkage .",
    "the algorithm works by tracking along edges ( perpendicular to the gradient ) hence the resulting edges require minimum post - processing linkage .",
    "secondly it is naturally multiscale , enabling a scientist to extract features in the size - scale range of interest .",
    "essentially we negate the need for preprocessing by simply studying the scale at which the feature of interest occurs .",
    "these two features combine to provide a good localisation and a single response to each edge in the image .",
    "these advantages are evident in the good comparison of global statistics against existing algorithms from .",
    "we reach a completeness of 0.91 and detection ratio of 1.05 , with a scaling index for the cumulative distribution of @xmath31 .",
    "these three statistics compare favourably to those in .",
    "the wtmm contains a few free parameters which we have attempted to optimise for loop detection .",
    "the most important free parameter is the choice of the form of the mother wavelet .",
    "we choose the derivative of gaussian ( dog ) as it is well studied mathematically and has previously been successful in tracking edges .",
    "we note that other , more naturally curvi - linear multiscale algorithms exist ( _ e.g. , _ curvelets , ridgelets ) which may assist in providing better identification of individual coronal loops .",
    "the other main free parameters are the choice of thresholds in tracking the edges ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "finally we propose that our sixth wavelet scale ( corresponding to @xmath28 pixels ) seems to optimise our ability to pick out the small scale features , retain smoothness in the extracted coordinates , and best agrees with the expected global statistics    an obvious extension of this work is to use the multiscale aspect in a soft - thresholding sense : currently we decide on an optiumum scale , there is the possiblity to instead decide on a best scaling index .",
    "this would consist of attempting to track each feature across scale .",
    "a noisy feature is expected to contain a lot of power at small scales , with very little power at larger scales . for a real feature , particularly the large complete coronal loops ,",
    "there is expected to be much less change across scales .",
    "this may assist in removing non - loop features near the footpoints of the loops system .",
    "we also note our extracted loops , even at scale 6 , are probably too ragged for stereoscopy and a degree of post - processing smoothing may still be neccessary .",
    "when applied to euvi images from both stereo ahead and behind data , this may allow for a 3d reconstruction of these loop systems with less manual labour .",
    "we expect algorithms such as the one studied here will be vital in the sdo era for the tracking of loops across a sequence of images , and hence in the expanding field of coronal seismology .",
    "let @xmath32 be the input image to be analized and @xmath33 the wavelet transform vector of @xmath7 at scale @xmath34 .",
    "the wavelet transform components are @xmath35 the square modulus of the wavelet transform vector is @xmath36 .",
    "let us note higher order derivative of @xmath7 this way using multiple @xmath1- or @xmath2-indices : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , _ etc ... _",
    "the wtmm are defined as the locations of the points where there is a maximum of the wavelet transform modulus along the direction of the wavelet transform vector , _",
    "i.e. , _ wtmm are the location of the greatest slope in the @xmath39 landscape .",
    "the steepest slope line is not exactly orthogonal to the wtmm edge ( only in particular cases ) . to find those points , we need to evaluate the scalar quantity ( @xmath40 ) defined as the dot product @xmath41 at each wtmm location , @xmath40 is zero and @xmath40 changes its sign when moving along the direction @xmath33 and crossing the wtmm .",
    "this is not enough to clearly identify a maximum , we also require that the second derivative along the direction @xmath33 must be strictly negative , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath42 the quantities @xmath40 and @xmath43 are computed exactly : @xmath44 @xmath43 is given by : @xmath45",
    "finally , the full algorithm is summed up .",
    "it is essentially a for loop over pixel location .",
    "note that the final edge image is made of the pixels containing a wtmm .",
    "the modulus at the `` exact '' wtmm location is adjusted using a polynomial fit using points along direction @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 the input image @xmath34 scale parameter compute wt of @xmath7 at scale @xmath34 : @xmath48 compute @xmath40 and @xmath43 pixel @xmath49 is labelled as a wtmm perform a third order polynomial interpolation along direction @xmath46 to get an accurate wavelet transform modulus value at maximum + wtmm edge image      - _ spatial resolution : finite - size and edge effects_. the minimum scale at which the wavelet transform is still resolved is seven pixels . on the other hand , in order to avoid artificial effects from the edges of the images , only the central 72% of the original wavelet transformed image should be kept for analysis . a methodical calculation of this parameter is carried out in    - _ scale resolution_. for an image of 1024 @xmath50 1024 pixels , usually 50 wavelet scales are considered , from seven pixels to @xmath0 200 pixels , in @xmath51 steps ( _ i.e. , _ very high resolution for small scales and low resolution at high scales ) .",
    "the seven - pixel lower limit restricts our resolution and is adopted to reduce the computational overhead .",

    "<S> we propose and test a wavelet transform modulus maxima method for the automated detection and extraction of coronal loops in extreme ultraviolet images of the solar corona . </S>",
    "<S> this method decomposes an image into a number of size scales and tracks enhanced power along each ridge corresponding to a coronal loop at each scale . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results across scales and suggest the optimum set of parameters to maximise completeness while minimising detection of noise . for a test coronal image , we compare the global statistics ( _ e.g. , _ number of loops at each length ) to previous automated coronal - loop detection algorithms . </S>"
