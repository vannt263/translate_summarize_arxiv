    "with recent advances in the field of ultra - cold atomic gases , trapped bose - einstein condensates ( bec s ) have become an important system to study many - body physics such as quantum phase transitions . in particular ,",
    "the ability to dynamically control the lattice structure and the strength of interaction as well as the absence of impurities in bec s confined in optical lattices , have led to the recent observation of the superfluid to mott - insulator transition @xcite . at the same time",
    ", there has been a tremendous interest in studying rotating bec s in harmonic traps ; at sufficient rotation an abrikosov lattice of quantized vortices has been observed @xcite and the realization of strongly correlated quantum states similar to the fractional quantum hall states has been predicted to occur at higher rotation rates @xcite . in these proposals ,",
    "the rotation can play the role of an effective magnetic field for the neutral atoms and in analogy with electrons , the atoms may enter into a state described by the laughlin wavefunction , which was introduced to describe the fractional quantum hall effect . while this approach yields a stable ground state separated from all excited states by an energy gap , in practice",
    "this gap is rather small because of the weak interactions among the particles in the magnetic traps typically used . in optical lattices ,",
    "the interaction energies are much larger because the atoms are confined in a much smaller volume , and the realization of the fractional quantum hall effect in optical lattices could therefore lead to a much higher energy gap and be much more robust . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", it was shown that it is indeed possible to realize the fractional quantum hall effect in an optical lattice , and that the energy gap achieved in this situation is a fraction of the tunneling energy , which can be considerably larger than the typical energy scales in a magnetic trap .",
    "in addition to being an interesting system in its own right , the fractional quantum hall effect , is also interesting from the point of view of topological quantum computation @xcite . in these schemes quantum states with fractional statistics can potentially perform fault tolerant quantum computation .",
    "so far , there has been no direct experimental observation of fractional statistics although some signatures has been observed in electron interferometer experiments @xcite .",
    "strongly correlated quantum gases can be a good alternative where the systems are more controllable and impurities are not present .",
    "therefore , realization of fractional quantum hall states in atomic gases can be a promising resource for topological quantum computation in the future .",
    "as noted above the fqh effect can be realized by simply rotating and cooling atoms confined in a harmonic trap . in this situation",
    ", it can be shown that the laughlin wavefunction exactly describes the ground state of the many body system @xcite . in an optical lattices , on the other hand , there are a number of questions which need to be addressed .",
    "first of all , it is unclear to which extent the lattices modifies the fractional quantum hall physics . for a single particle ,",
    "the lattice modifies the energy levels from being simple landau levels into the fractal structure known as the hofstadter butterfly @xcite . in the regime",
    "where the magnetic flux going through each lattice @xmath0 is small , one expects that this will be of minor importance and in ref .",
    "it was argued that the fractional quantum hall physics persists until @xmath1 . in this paper ,",
    "we extent and quantify predictions carried out in ref .   .",
    "whereas ref .   only considered the effect of infinite onsite interaction , we extent the analysis to finite interactions . furthermore , where ref .   mainly argued that the ground state of the atoms was in a quantum hall state by considering the overlap of the ground state found by numerical diagonalization with the laughlin wavefunction , we provide further evidence for this claim by characterizing the topological order of the system by calculating chern numbers .",
    "these calculations thus characterize the order in the system even for parameter regimes where the overlap with the laughlin wavefunction is decreased by the lattice structure .",
    "in addition to considering these fundamental features of the fqh states on a lattice , which are applicable regardless of the system being used to realize the effect , we also study a number of questions which are of particular interest to experimental efforts towards realizing the effect with atoms in optical lattices .",
    "in particular , we show that adding dipole interactions between the atoms can be used to increase the energy gap and stabilize the ground state .",
    "furthermore , we study bragg spectroscopy of atoms in the lattice and show that this is a viable method to identify the quantum hall states created in an experiment , and we discuss a new method to generate an effective magnetic field for the neutral atoms in the lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ section - no_hardcore ] , we study the system with finite onsite interaction . in sec .",

    "[ magnetic ] outlines a new approach for generating the type of the hamiltonian studied in this paper .",
    "the fractional quantum hall effect occurs for electrons confined in a two dimensional plane under the presences of a perpendicular strong magnetic field .",
    "if @xmath3 is the number of electrons in the system and @xmath4 is the number of magnetic fluxes measured in units of the quantum magnetic flux @xmath5 , then depending on the filling factor @xmath6 the ground state of the system can form highly entangled states exhibiting a rich behaviors , such as incompressibility , charge density waves , and anyonic excitations with fractional statistics . in particular , when @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an integer , the ground state of the system is an incompressible quantum liquid which is protected by an energy gap from all other states , and in the landau gauge is well described by the laughlin wavefunction @xcite :    ( z_1,z_2, ... ,z_n)=_j > k^n ( z_j - z_k)^m _",
    "j=1^n e^- y^2_i/2 [ laughlin ] , where the integer @xmath8 should be odd in order to meet the antisymmetrization requirement for fermions .",
    "although the fractional quantum hall effect occurs for fermions ( electrons ) , bosonic systems with repulsive interactions can exhibit similar behaviors .",
    "in particular , the laughlin states with even @xmath8 correspond to bosons . in this article , we study bosons since the experimental implementation are more advanced for the ultra - cold bosonic systems .",
    "we study a system of atoms confined in a 2d lattice which can be described by the bose - hubbard model @xcite with the peierls substitution @xcite , @xmath9 + where @xmath10 is the hopping energy between two neighboring sites , @xmath11 is the onsite interaction energy , and @xmath12 is the phase acquired by a particle going around a plaquette .",
    "this hamiltonian is equivalent to the hamiltonian of a u(1 ) gauge field ( transverse magnetic field ) on a square lattice .",
    "more precisely , the non - interacting part can be written as -j_<ij",
    "> a^_i a_j ( ^j_i ) where @xmath13 is the vector potential for a uniform magnetic field and the path of the integral is chosen to be a straight line between two neighboring sites .",
    "in the symmetric gauge , the vector potential is written as @xmath14 .",
    "hence , @xmath0 will be the amount of magnetic flux going through one plaquette .    while the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) occurs naturally for charged particles in a magnetic field , the realization of a similar hamiltonian for neutral particles is not straightforward . as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ magnetic ] this may be achieved in a rotating harmonic trap , and this have been very successfully used in a number of experiments in magnetic traps @xcite , but the situation is more complicated for an optical lattice .",
    "however , there has been a number of proposals for lattice realization of a magnetic field @xcite , and recently it has been realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "@xcite have studied the realization of fractional hall states for a few particles in individual lattice sites .",
    "a new approach for rotating the entire optical lattice is discussed in sec .",
    "[ magnetic ] .",
    "the essence of the above hamiltonian is a non - zero phase that a particle should acquire when it goes around a plaquette .",
    "this phase can be obtained for example by alternating the tunneling and adding a quadratic superlattice potential @xcite or by simply rotating the lattice ( sec.[magnetic ] ) .",
    "the advantage of confining ultra - cold gases in an optical lattice is to enhance the interaction between atoms which consequently result in a higher energy gap comparing to harmonic trap proposals ( e.g. ref . ) .",
    "this enhancement in the energy gap of the excitation spectrum can alleviate some of the challenges for experimental realization of the quantum hall state for ultra - cold atoms .      in order to approximate a large system , we study the system with periodic boundary condition , i.e. on a torus , where the topological properties of the system is best manifested .",
    "there are two energy scales for the system : the first is the magnetic tunneling term , @xmath15 , which is related to the cyclotron energy in the continuum limit @xmath16 and the second is the onsite interaction energy @xmath11 .",
    "experimentally , the ratio between these two energy scales can be varied by varying the lattice potential height @xcite or by feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "let us first assume that we are in the continuum limit where @xmath17 , i.e. the flux through each plaquette is a small fraction of a flux quantum . a determining factor for describing the system is the filling factor @xmath18 , and in this study we mainly focus on the case of @xmath19 , since this will be the most experimentally accessible regime .",
    "we restrict ourself to the simplest boundary conditions for the single particle states @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the magnetic translation operator which translates the single particle states @xmath22 around the torus . the definition and detailed discussion of the boundary conditions will be elaborated in section [ section - chern ] . the discussed quantities in this section , such as energy spectrum , gap and overlap ,",
    "do not depend on the boundary condition angles ( this is also verified by our numerical calculation ) .    in the continuum case , for the filling fraction @xmath19 , the laughlin state in landau gauge @xmath23",
    "is given by eq .",
    "( [ laughlin ] ) with @xmath24 .",
    "the generalization of the laughlin wavefunction to a torus takes the form @xcite ( z_1,z_2, ...",

    "this degeneracy in the continuum limit is due to the translational symmetry of the ground state on the torus , and the same argument can be applied to a lattice system when the magnetic length is much larger than the lattice spacing @xmath32 . for higher magnetic",
    "filed , the lattice structure becomes more pronounced .",
    "however , in our numerical calculation for a moderate magnetic field @xmath33 , we observe a two - fold degeneracy ground state well separated from the excited state by an energy gap .",

    "[ section - chern ] .    in the continuum limit @xmath32",
    ", the laughlin wavefunction is the exact ground state of the many body system with a short range interaction @xcite .",

    ", only one particle is permitted on each lattice site , therefore for @xmath3 particles on a lattice with the number of sites equal to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the unit lattice side , the hilbert space size is given by the combination @xmath36 .",
    "on the other hand , in case of finite onsite interaction , the particles can be on top of each other , so the hilbert space is bigger and is given by the combination @xmath37 . in our simulations the dimension of the hilbert can be raised up to @xmath38 and the hamiltonian is constructed in the configuration space by taking into account the tunneling and interacting terms .",
    "the tunneling term is written in the symmetric gauge , and we make sure that the phase acquired around a plaquette is equal to @xmath39 , and that the generalized magnetic boundary condition is satisfied when the particles tunnels over the edge of the lattice [ to be discussed in sec .

    "the energy gap above the ground state and the ground state overlap with the laughlin wavefunction for the case of @xmath19 in a dilute lattice @xmath40 , are depicted in figure .",
    "[ tuning_u ] .",
    "the laughlin wavefunction remains a good description of the ground state even if the strength of the repulsive interaction tends to zero ( fig .",
    "[ tuning_u ] a ) .",
    "below , we discuss different limits :    first , we consider @xmath41 : if the interaction energy scale @xmath11 is much larger than the magnetic one @xmath42 , all low energy states lie in a manifold , where the highest occupation number for each site is one , i.e. this corresponds to the hard - core limit .",
    "the ground state is the laughlin state and the excited states are various mixtures of landau states .",
    "the ground state is two - fold degenerate @xcite and the gap reaches the value in for the hard - core limit at large @xmath43 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] ( a ) . in this limit",
    "the gap only depends on the tunneling @xmath10 and flux @xmath0 , and the gap is a fraction of @xmath10 .",
    "these results are consistent with the previous work in ref . .",
    "secondly , we consider @xmath44 . in this regime ,",
    "the magnetic energy scale @xmath45 is much larger than the interaction energy scale @xmath11 . for repulsive regime ( @xmath46 )",
    ", the ground state is the laughlin state and the gap increases linearly with @xmath47 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] b.    thirdly , we study @xmath48 where the interaction is absent and the ground state becomes highly degenerate . for a single particle on a lattice ,",
    "the spectrum is the famous hostadfer s butterfly @xcite , while in the continuum limit @xmath49 , the ground state is the lowest landau level ( lll ) .",
    "the single particle degeneracy of the lll is the number of fluxes going through the surface , @xmath50 .",
    "so in the case of @xmath3 bosons , the lowest energy is obtained by putting @xmath3 bosons in @xmath50 levels .",
    "therefore , the many - body ground state s degeneracy should be : @xmath51 for example , 3 bosons and 6 fluxes gives a 336-fold degeneracy in the non - interacting ground state .    if we increase the amount of phase ( flux ) per plaquette ( @xmath52 ) we are no longer in the continuum limit",
    ". the landau level degeneracy will be replace by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the amount of flux per plaquette and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are coprime @xcite .",
    "then , the many - body degeneracy will be : @xmath57 .",
    "fourthly , we consider @xmath58 : when u is negative ( i.e. attractive interaction ) in the limit strong interaction regime , the ground state of the system will become a _ pillar _ state . in a pillar state ,",
    "all bosons in the system condensate into a single site .",

    ", it is also possible to realize the fractional quantum hall states for attractive interaction in the limit when @xmath60 .",
    "assume that the occupation number of each site is either zero or one .",
    "since the attraction energy @xmath11 is very high and there is no channel into which the system can dissipate its energy , the probability for a boson to hop to a site where there is already a boson is infinitesimally small .",
    "therefore , the high energy attraction will induce an effective hard - core constraint in the case of ultra - cold system .",
    "the energy of these state should be exactly equal to their hard - core ground state counterparts , since the interaction expectation value of the interaction energy is zero for the laughlin state .",
    "the numerical simulation shows that these two degenerate states indeed have a good overlap with the laughlin wavefunction similar to their repulsive hard - core counterparts and also their energies are equal to the hard - core ground state .",

    "so far we have mainly considered a dilute lattice @xmath62 , where the difference between a lattice and the continuum is very limited .",
    "we shall now begin to investigate what happens for larger values of @xmath0 , where the effect of the lattice plays a significant role .",
    "[ high - alpha - overlap ] , shows the ground state overlap with the laughlin wavefunction as a function of the strength of magnetic flux @xmath0 and the strength of the onsite interaction @xmath11 .",

    "this behavior does nt depend significantly on the number of particles for the limited number of particles that we have investigated @xmath63 .",
    "we have , however , not made any modification to the laughlin wave function to take into account the underlying lattice , and from the calculations presented so far , it is unclear whether the decreasing wave function overlap represents a change in the nature of the ground state , or whether it is just caused by a modification to the laughlin wave function due the difference between the continuum and the lattice . to investigate this , in the next section ,",
    "we provide a better characterization of the ground state in terms of chern numbers , which shows that the same topological order is still present in the system for higher values of @xmath0 .    as a summary , we observe that the laughlin wavefunction is a good description for the case of dilute lattice ( @xmath32 ) , regardless of the strength of the onsite interaction . however , the protective gap of the ground state becomes smaller for weaker values of interaction and in the perturbative regime @xmath64 is proportional to @xmath47 for @xmath65 .",
    "in the theory of quantum hall effect , it is well understood that the conductance quantization , is due to the existence of certain topological invariants , so called chern numbers .",
    "the topological invariance was first introduced by avron _ _ et al.__@xcite in the context of thouless _",
    "et al . _ ( tkndn ) s original theory @xcite about quantization of the conductance .",
    "tkndn in their seminal work , showed that the hall conductance calculated from the kubo formula can be expressed into an integral over the magnetic brillouin zone , which shows the quantization explicitly .",
    "the original paper of tkndn deals with the single - particle problem and bloch waves which can not be generalized to topological invariance .",
    "the generalization to many - body systems has been done by niu _ _ et al.__@xcite and also tao _ _ et al.__@xcite , by manipulating the phases describing the closed boundary conditions on a torus ( i.e. twist angles ) , both for the integer and the fractional hall systems .",
    "these twist angles come from natural generalization of the closed boundary condition .",
    "to clarify the origin of these phases , we start with a single particle picture .",
    "a single particle with charge ( @xmath66 ) on a torus of the size @xmath67 in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath68 perpendicular to the torus surface , is described by the hamiltonian h_s= , where @xmath13 is the corresponding vector potential ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "this hamiltonian is invariant under the magnetic translation ,    t_s(*a*)=e^i * * ak**^s / where @xmath70 is a vector in the plane , and @xmath71 is the pseudomomentum , defined by    @xmath72    the generalized boundary condition on a torus is given by the single - particle translation    @xmath73    where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are twist angles of the boundary .",
    "the origin of these phases can be understood by noting that the periodic boundary conditions corresponds to the torus in fig .",
    "[ torus](a ) .",
    "the magnetic flux through the surface arises from the field perpendicular to the surface of the torus .",
    "however , in addition to this flux , there may also be fluxes due to a magnetic field residing inside the torus or passing through the torus hole , and it is these extra fluxes which give rise to the phases .",
    "the extra free angles are all the same for all particles and all states in the hilbert space , and their time derivative can be related to the voltage drops across the hall device in two dimensions .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , including the ground state will be a function of these boundary angles @xmath76 . by defining some integral form of this eigenstate , one can introduce quantities , that do not depend on the details of the system , but reveal general topological features of the eigenstates .",
    "first we discuss the simplest situation , where the ground state is non - degenerate , and later we shall generalize this to our situation with a degenerate ground state .",

    "moreover , it enables us to characterize the ground state in different regimes , especially where the calculation of the overlap with the laughlin wave function fails to give a conclusive answer .    before explaining the method for calculating the chern number , we clarify some issues related to the degeneracy of the ground state . in some systems",

    "this multicomponent feature of the ground state on a torus has a physical significance , while the single component ground state on a sphere boundary condition gives zero conductance , the torus geometry with multicomponent ground state results in a correct conductance measured in the experiment , since the torus boundary condition is more relevant to the experiment .",
    "changing twists angles of the boundary will rotate these components into each other and gives an overall non - zero conductance @xcite .",
    "as studied in a recent work by m. oshikawa and t. senthil @xcite , as a universal feature , it has been shown that in presence of a gap , there is a direct connection between the fractionalization and the topological order .",
    "more precisely , once a system has some quasiparticles with fractional statistics , a topological degeneracy should occur , which indicates the presence of a topological order .",
    "therefore , the amount of the degeneracy is related to the statistics of the fractionalized quasiparticles e.g. in the case of @xmath19 , the two - fold degeneracy is related to 1/2 anyonic statistics of the corresponding quasiparticles .",

    "below , we explore both cases . in the first case ,",
    "we introduce some fixed impurities to lift the degeneracy in the ground state for all values of the twist angles .",
    "this is an artifact of the finite size of the system which we take advantage of . in the presence of perturbation , we show that the system has a topological order in spite of poor overlap with the laughlin state . in the second approach , we use a scheme recently proposed by hatsugai @xcite which is a generalized form for degenerate manifolds .      in this section ,",
    "we introduce some perturbation in the finite system in form of local potentials ( similar to local impurities in electronic systems ) to split the degeneracy of the ground state and resolve the corresponding gauge invariance , which allows us to compute the chern number .",

    "the dynamic and static structure factors are given respectively as    s(,)=_n , 0| n | ^()| 0|^2 ( -e_n+e_0 ) ,    s()=_n,0 | n | ^()| 0|^2 = _ n,0 | n | _ e^i | 0|^2 , where the density fluctuation operator is defined as @xmath219 and the coefficient are defined as fourier transforms of the wannier functions : @xmath220 , where the wannier function @xmath221 is the wave function of an atom localized on a site centered at @xmath222",
    ". below , we focus on deep optical lattices , where @xmath223 .    in the structure factor",
    ", there is a sum over the excited states @xmath224 and ground states @xmath225 and the self - term is thus excluded .",
    "the ground state on a torus is two - fold degenerate and therefore in our numerics , we add the contribution of both .",
    "since we are working on a discrete lattice , there will be a cut - off in the allowed momentum given by the lattice spacing @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the distance between lattice sites .",
    "[ 3atoms - structure](a ) shows the structure factor for the case @xmath19 for a small @xmath0 calculated from our numerical diagonalizations . in the data presented here , we have chosen @xmath228 and but",
    "the result should be similar in other directions in the lattice plane .",
    "we see that @xmath218 is modulated at a momentum corresponding to the magnetic length . for the parameters that we have investigated ,",
    "the general features of the structure factor is independent of the size of the system .",
    "we obtain the excitation spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ 3atoms - structure ] ( b ) similar to ref .   by the feynman - bijl approximation . in the continuum limit ( @xmath229 )",
    ", we assume that the low - lying excitations are long - wavelength density oscillations and their wave functions can be approximated to have the form @xmath230 .",
    "therefore , the variational estimate for the excitation energy is @xmath231 . at zero momentum and at the momentum corresponding to the magnetic length ,",
    "there are gaps , and we also observe a deviation from the free particle spectrum similar to the magneoroton case as a reminiscent of the wigner crystal .",
    "it should be noted that the deviation does not depend on the size or the number of particles in the system . as clearly seen in the fig .",
    "[ 3atoms - structure ] the energy spectrum and structure factor deviate from those of free particles , therefore , it could be used as an experimental probe of the system .    the structure factor and excitation spectrum",
    "imply some general features that are very different from that of the mott - insulator and superfluid states , and can be used a powerful experimental indication of the quantum hall states .",
    "recently , there has been several proposals for producing artificial magnetic field for neutral atoms in optical lattices @xcite , however , the implementation of each of them is still experimentally demanding .",
    "recently , there has been an experimental demonstration of a rotating optical lattice @xcite which is equivalent to an effective magnetic field ( see below ) . the technique used in this experiment",
    ", however , generates a lattice with a large lattice spacing , because it uses laser beam which are not exactly counter propagating .",
    "this longer spacing reduces the energy scale in the lattice and thereby also reduces quantities such as energy gaps . here",
    ", we shall now introduce an alternative method for generating a rotating optical lattice , which does not result in an increased lattice spacing .",
    "this method consists of rotating the optical lattice by manipulating laser beams .    in a frame of reference rotating with angular velocity @xmath232 around the @xmath233 , the hamiltonian for a particle of mass @xmath8 in an ( planar ) harmonic trap of natural frequency @xmath234",
    "is    @xmath235    at resonance @xmath236 the form is equivalent to the hamiltonian of a particle of charge @xmath66 experiencing an effective magnetic field @xmath237 .",
    "therefore , by simply rotating the optical lattice , we can mimic the magnetic field for neutral atoms .    to rotate the optical lattice",
    ", we propose to set up four acousto - optic modulators ( aom ) and four focusing composite lenses as shown in the fig .",
    "[ lattice_rotation ] . by sweeping the acoustic wave frequency ,",
    "the beams can be focused and make a rotating optical lattice .        in an aom , for the first order diffracted light we have @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is the wavelength of sound in the medium , @xmath240 is the light wavelength and @xmath241 is half of the angle between a diffracted beam and the non - diffracted beam ( fig .",
    "[ lattice_rotation ] ) . by increasing the frequency of the acoustic wave ,",
    "the diffraction angle increases .",
    "however , the beam should be focused by a large aperture lens so that it always passes the region where we want to make the optical lattice . by focusing a similar but counter - propagating beam ,",
    "we can make a rotating standing wave ( fig .",
    "[ lattice_rotation ] ) .",
    "by repeating the same configuration in the transverse direction , we can make a rotating optical lattice .",
    "in particular , if the aom is far from the composite lenses , @xmath242 , then @xmath243 and @xmath244 where @xmath245 , where the parameters are defined in fig .",
    "[ lattice_rotation ] .",
    "if we consider a square lattice with dimensions @xmath246 , the number of magnetic flux given by rotation is n_== where @xmath247 is the atomic recoil frequency .    on the other hand ,",
    "the upper limit for the magnetic field comes from the single bloch band approximation which we made in writing the hamiltonian for the optical lattice . in order for",
    "the particles to remain in the first band , the traveling lattice beams should move them adiabatically . from ref .",
    ", the adiabaticity condition for a moving lattice with an acceleration @xmath248 equal to @xmath249 at the edge , is @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is the frequency difference between the first and the second band in the lattice .",
    "this puts a limit on how large the lattice can become @xmath252 .",
    "hence , for @xmath19 with a lattice filling fraction @xmath253 and a typical recoil frequency @xmath254 khz , one can enter the regime of fractional quantum hall effect by rotating the lattice at @xmath255 hz .",
    "if a deep optical lattice is used e.g. @xmath256 , the adiabaticity condition is easily satisfied for a lattice of size @xmath257 .",
    "the experimentally challenging part will , however , likely be to mitigate the instability of the lattice caused by the thickness of the beam and aberration of the lenses at the turning points i.e. near @xmath258 .",
    "an extended study of the realization of the fractional quantum hall states in optical lattices has been presented .",
    "we showed that a hamiltonian similar to that of a magnetic field for charged particles can be constructed for neutral ultra cold atoms and molecules confined in an optical lattice . by adding an onsite interaction for the case of @xmath19 , an energy gap develops between the ground state and the first excited state , which increases linearly as @xmath47 and",
    "saturates to its value in the hardcore limit @xmath126 .",
    "we learned that the laughlin wavefunction is a reliable description of the system for low flux densities @xmath201 .",
    "for higher @xmath0 s , the lattice structure becomes more pronounced and a better description of the system can be carried out by investigating the chern number associated to the ground state manifold .",
    "the chern number indicates that the system has topological order up to some critical flux density @xmath161 , where the properties of the ground state manifold starts to change .",
    "we have also studied @xmath2 , where compared to @xmath19 , the laughlin wavefunction only describes the ground state for lower values of the flux @xmath199 .",
    "we showed that a dipole - dipole interaction can enhance the gap and stabilize the system , and therefore make the ground state more experimentally realizable .",
    "bragg spectroscopy has been studied as a potential experimental tool to diagnose theses incompressible states .",

    "[ gauge - fixing ] , can be generalized to other interesting many - body systems where the conventional overlap calculation fails to work .",
