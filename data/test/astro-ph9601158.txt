    "any theory which purports to explain the large - scale structures we observe today , must simultaneously fit the increasing amount of data on cmb anisotropies .",
    "the combination of these two constraints is especially powerful , since they probe a large lever arm both in scale ( @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) and time ( @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) .",
    "calculations of both cmb anisotropy spectra and matter power spectra are now well developed for inflationary models , with the former approaching 1% precision @xcite .",
    "( in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl_ref ] we show the anisotropy power spectrum for the `` standard '' cdm model , see @xcite for a discussion of the physics behind these anisotropies ) .",
    "this kind of precision in theoretical predictions is necessary to interpret the results envisioned from a future satellite cmb mission , which could accurately measure the power spectrum over a broad range of scales , allowing one to measure most of the standard cosmological parameters with unprecedented accuracy @xcite .",
    "however such a measurement is still ( optimistically ) several years away , and in the meantime the data on cmb anisotropies continues to be amassed at a steady rate . for the interpretation of current data ,",
    "such a high level of precision is not necessary , and semi - analytic techniques exist which can give spectra accurate to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "an important constraint on structure formation models can be obtained without even this amount of effort however .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that for measurements of the spectrum constrained to scales of @xmath6 or above , the anisotropy power spectra exhibit a degeneracy in parameter space , which can be both a hindrance and a boon .",
    "this degeneracy has been dubbed `` cosmic confusion '' @xcite as it provides a limit to how well cosmological parameters can be extracted from measures of the cmb power spectra on scales larger than @xmath7 .",
    "notice the promise this degeneracy has in simplifying the interpretation of degree scale cmb data .",
    "as noted by dodelson & kosowsky @xcite , if this degeneracy holds it is possible to characterize the constraints on a wide range of models in terms of two parameters : an overall amplitude and the value of the degenerate combination of parameters @xmath8 ( see  [ sec : confusion ] for details .",
    "a part of this approximate degeneracy was implicitly used in @xcite to constrain the spectral slope and ionization history from the peak height ) .",
    "the amplitude of the _ potential _ fluctuations , measured on the largest scales by _ cobe _ , has become the preferred method for normalizing theories of large - scale structure @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath8 will constrain other parameters on which the predictions of the theory depend . furthermore , to the extent that cosmic confusion holds , generating spectra for a wide range of parameters can be reduced to simple modifications of a standard spectrum ( however with the advent of semi - analytic techniques for quickly generating spectra over the entire angular range , this may be of limited utility ) . an obvious application of this",
    "is a fitting formula for the height of the peak in the power spectra at @xmath12 .",
    "the current data provide limits on the height of the peak ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which are becoming stronger .",
    "a quick method of estimating the height of the peak in the cmb spectrum can allow one to estimate the constraints from degree - scale measurements quickly and efficiently over a broad range of parameter space .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : confusion ] we discuss how well cosmic confusion works , and slightly modify the original formulation @xcite . ",
    "[ sec : reion ] discusses the special case of late reionization in processing the spectra . in  [ sec : fit ] we use a compilation of cmb data to provide a limit on the peak height and discuss implications for models of structure formation . ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] presents the conclusions .",
    "in this section we would like to make some comments about , and minor improvements upon , the degeneracy of cmb spectra with respect to certain parameters which has been dubbed `` cosmic confusion '' @xcite .",
    "specifically , it is claimed that for a range of parameters the cmb anisotropy spectra are degenerate in @xmath13 where @xmath11 is the ( scalar ) spectral index , @xmath14 is the ratio of tensors to scalars ( see below ) , @xmath15 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the reionization redshift ( see  [ sec : reion ] ) .",
    "the degeneracy is supposed to hold up to the first peak in the power spectrum , @xmath18 , though some spectra can be degenerate over an even larger range of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "to start let us take as our guiding principle the following conjecture :    * for reasonable input parameters all cmb anisotropy spectra with the same peak - to - plateau ratio will be approximately degenerate .",
    "the interpretation of this statement clearly depends upon what range of cosmological models are adopted , over what range of scales the degeneracy is required to hold ( not beyond the first peak ) , and the precise meaning of `` approximately '' .",
    "we will discuss all of these issues below .",
    "inflation in its most generic form predicts a flat universe , so in this paper we will restrict ourselves to models with vanishing spatial curvature .",
    "several questions relating to open inflation are still unresolved , for example the predictions for super - curvature modes , spectral tilt and tensor modes to be very close to ( or greater than ) 1 . ] .",
    "while for any given model the calculations of the power spectrum are straightforward @xcite , we feel that these uncertainties make fitting to spectra premature for these models .",
    "the simplest implementation of cosmic confusion is in terms of an apparent spectral index , which we shall call @xmath8 ( this is related to the @xmath20 of @xcite by @xmath21 ) . as our base model",
    "we shall adopt ` standard ' cdm ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) for which we define @xmath27 .",
    "this spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl_ref ] and tabulated in table  [ tab : scdm ] .",
    "the spectrum for a model whose parameters combine to give @xmath8 is then related to that of standard cdm by the simple formula @xmath28 where @xmath29 for notational convenience .",
    "we have chosen to pivot around @xmath30 as this is approximately the pivot point of the _ cobe _ data @xcite . alternatively one could use @xmath31 @xcite , which turns out to be almost the same for the range of spectra under consideration .    to understand the expression for @xmath8 in terms of the parameters of the model ,",
    "we need only consider the effect of changing each parameter on the peak height of the model .",
    "we will now consider each of these effects in turn , concentrating first on those parameters for which the conjecture works well and then turning to those for which the deviations are larger .    as discussed in @xcite changing",
    "the spectral index , @xmath11 , of the primordial spectrum ( @xmath32 ) is equivalent to multiplying the anisotropy spectrum by @xmath33 as in eq .",
    "[ eqn : tiltapp ] . for",
    "@xmath34 the worst deviations induced by this approximation occur around @xmath3550 , and are @xmath36 . hence tilting the model away from scale invariance changes @xmath8 by @xmath37 .",
    "associated with tilt is the possibility that some of the cmb anisotropy comes from long - wavelength , inflation - produced gravitational waves ( tensor fluctuations ) .",
    "the fraction , @xmath14 , of tensors is usually quoted in terms of the contribution to the quadrupole : @xmath38 .",
    "unfortunately due to the decaying potentials in a @xmath39 model the scalar quadrupole is very sensitive to @xmath40 @xcite for a fixed `` initial '' power spectrum .",
    "the tensor quadrupole is much less sensitive @xcite and hence the ratio has a strong ( artificial ) @xmath39 dependence @xcite .",
    "we choose instead to write @xmath41 , where the prefactor has been chosen to make the definitions agree for @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath30 mode is not as strongly affected by the decaying potentials @xcite making this a more robust measure of the underlying tensor / scalar ratio .",
    "since the tensor spectrum damps rapidly on scales smaller than the horizon at last scattering @xcite the effect of introducing a tensor component is to increase the plateau by @xmath43 while leaving the peak unchanged . [",
    "the factor 0.76 is roughly @xmath44 for a scale - invariant spectrum with @xmath23 . ]",
    "an equivalent reduction in the peak height relative to the plateau can be accomplished by reducing the spectral index ( from @xmath30 to @xmath12 ) by , @xmath45    in the semi - analytic , two - fluid models of cmb anisotropies @xcite , the height of the first peak depends primarily on the combinations @xmath46 ( which sets the speed of sound in the coupled baryon - photon fluid ) and the redshift of matter - radiation equality . the latter scales with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the fraction of the radiation made up of photons , scaled to be 1 in the standard model with 3 massless neutrino species . in models in which more relativistic species are included , such as decaying neutrino models @xcite , @xmath49 can be reduced leading to a larger peak height , just as if @xmath50 were lowered . as a warning we point out that this ` degeneracy ' is not exact , due to the effect of @xmath40 at low redshift ( which is included implicitly in the formulation of the semi - analytic models @xcite ) .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : cl_compare ] we show spectra for two models with the same ( reasonable ) values of @xmath51 and @xmath46 , which differ even up to the first peak by 510% .",
    "specifically the models have @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the first with ( @xmath50,@xmath54)=(0.4,0.25 ) and the second with ( 1,0.1 ) .",
    "as one can see from the figure , the exact height and position of the first peak are complicated functions of the cosmological parameters !",
    "the reason for the breaking of the degeneracy in this particular case is that the large - angle temperature fluctuations ( from decaying potentials at @xmath39 domination ) and the projection of physical scales to @xmath19 both depend on @xmath40 , not just @xmath55 .",
    "the original statement of cosmic confusion was meant to hold for models with @xmath53 , meaning that models with equal @xmath51 would be degenerate , and furthermore that they would coincide with models with some @xmath56 . for models with scale invariant initial perturbations , @xmath23 , @xmath53 and @xmath57 to 0.75 ,",
    "we find that the height of the peak ( relative to @xmath58 ) is very well fit by @xmath59 we note that @xmath60 ranges from 260 to 200 over this range of @xmath15 , since a changing sound speed causes the sound horizon at last scattering to subtend a varying angular scale @xcite .",
    "this small movement of the peak should not matter if we redefine `` cosmic confusion '' to hold when averaged over a reasonably broad window in @xmath19 , as is the case in most experiments to date . under the `` confusion '' assumption",
    "then we predict that @xmath61 which is roughly equivalent to the original statement given in @xcite .",
    "both this approximation , and the original statement @xcite , give @xmath36 deviations in @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "[ the percentage deviations for @xmath65 can be larger than 10% , but here cosmic variance is also larger . ]    similarly we find that the variation with @xmath10 at fixed @xmath46 and @xmath15 works at the @xmath5 level in power for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , with @xmath68 this is not exactly what we would have expected based on a degeneracy in @xmath69 : the scaling with @xmath50 is slightly weaker , and that with @xmath49 weaker still .",
    "[ this can be traced to the same non - degeneracy mentioned above and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl_compare ] . ]    note that at present @xmath46 as determined by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is uncertain to a factor of @xmath70 ( c.f .",
    "the hubble constant ! ) @xcite .",
    "thus we are compelled to study the variation of the peak height with the sound speed , or @xmath46 , which was not included in the original statement of cosmic confusion @xcite . for @xmath23 and @xmath71 the height of the peak is relatively well fit by an exponential in @xmath72 for @xmath22 and less well fit by an exponential for @xmath73 .",
    "unfortunately the slopes of the fits for these two cases ( which have different @xmath74 ) disagree : @xmath75 as a compromise then we take the average of the two coefficients to arrive at our dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath46 @xmath76 which holds relatively well over the range preferred by bbn : @xmath77 @xcite .    in summary",
    "then we can define a `` spectral tilt '' @xmath8 through @xmath78 for a large range of @xmath79 cdm models , we find with this @xmath8 that `` cosmic confusion '' holds at the @xmath5 level in power ( 5% in temperature ) up to @xmath80 for those models with @xmath67 , @xmath81 and @xmath77 ( we discuss @xmath82 in  [ sec : reion ] ) .",
    "this deviation usually occurs at @xmath8350 and some of it can be attributed to the approximation for tilt of the primordial spectrum that we are using ( eq .  [ eqn : tiltapp ] ) . for low-@xmath50 or @xmath15 models the shape of the rise into the peak and the position of the peak are sufficiently different that a tilted model is not a good fit ( though our fit is a good approximation to the height of the peak even for @xmath84 ) .",
    "on the other hand for some models in the range mentioned the degeneracy is good to 1% in power for @xmath85 .",
    "the logarithmic dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath51 differs from the linear dependence of @xmath20 on the same quantity found by @xcite .",
    "both approximations give similar `` worst fit '' @xmath62 , but the logarithm is a better fit to the height of the peak ( @xmath86 relative to @xmath58 ) over the range of models considered ; it works to better than 5% .    with the rapid progress being made in measurements of the cmb anisotropy , it is likely that we will need to do better than 10% in the very near future .",
    "a more complicated fit or a better treatment of spectral tilt could alleviate matters slightly .",
    "however , bearing in mind that the position of the peak also changes with the input parameters and that the degeneracies ( e.g.  @xmath87 ) built into `` confusion '' themselves only hold at the 510% level , one is lead to conclude that `` one number '' summaries of the cmb data are becoming a thing of the past .",
    "of course , eq .  [ eqn : nudef ] is still useful as a quick - and - dirty method of estimating the height of the peak ( to 5% ) in the power spectrum for quite a wide range of parameters .",
    "this can be useful for narrowing the large parameter space down to a smaller region which can be searched more carefully ( as one often uses linear theory estimates in large - scale structure work ) .",
    "if the experiments are chosen to probe scales for which `` confusion '' works well , then constraints on @xmath8 will still encode much of the information that the cmb has for large - scale structure .    as more experiments probe scales `` beyond the first peak '' ( @xmath88 ) , the utility of cosmic confusion as a summary of _ all _ cmb constraints will decrease .",
    "in these cases one must search a multi - dimensional parameter space and compute the full cmb spectrum either by numerical evolution of the coupled boltzmann equations or fast semi - analytic methods which can be accurate to @xmath36 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . moving beyond this degeneracy",
    "will allow us to obtain more information about the cosmological parameters from study of the detailed structure of the power spectrum .",
    "in the original statement of cosmic confusion @xcite , there was a term for the reionization redshift .",
    "reionization in the adiabatic models of interest is likely to occur very rapidly @xcite and at relatively low redshift , @xmath17 . since @xmath17 the universe has probably been fully ionized .",
    "we show in table  [ tab : zr ] a `` reasonable '' estimate of the reionization redshift for some models by way of example .",
    "these determinations rely on several assumptions and so should only be taken as illustrative .",
    "the results are also very sensitive to the value of @xmath46 and @xmath89 chosen .    in such a scenario ,",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuations on small scales is reduced by @xmath90 @xcite , where @xmath91\\ ] ] ( for @xmath92 ) is the optical depth to thomson scattering from @xmath93 to @xmath17 ( also shown in table  [ tab : zr ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath94 depends not only on @xmath17 but also on @xmath72 and @xmath15 , which was neglected in the original treatment of cosmic confusion @xcite .",
    "( for the accuracy to which the spectrum depends on and scales with @xmath94 see @xcite . )",
    "in addition new fluctuations are generated on larger angular scales for @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "reionized spectra are _ not _ well described by a simple tilting of the scdm spectrum .",
    "an approximation which has the correct asymptotic forms @xcite is to multiply the spectrum by @xmath96 $ ] , where @xmath97 is the optical depth from @xmath93 to redshift @xmath98 and @xmath99 defines a mapping from angles to redshift ( e.g.  the redshift at which the horizon subtends an angle @xmath100 ) .",
    "while this approximation has the right asymptotic form , it fails to be a good approximation to a reionized spectrum for @xmath95 since it does not take into account the fluctuations generated on the new last scattering surface .",
    "these fluctuations typically do not extend to @xmath101 , so if one is interested only in scales near the peak of the spectrum a reduction of @xmath102 $ ] is appropriate .    because reionization is such an important part of interpreting cmb anisotropy measurements in the context of cosmological models",
    ", we will defer a more detailed discussion of reionization to a future paper @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss what we can infer about @xmath8 from current observations of cmb anisotropy .",
    "we shall use the data tabulated in @xcite since the newer data is ( mostly ) not yet available . as discussed in @xcite and below , the constraints even without including the new data are very interesting for large - scale structure modelling .",
    "several issues regarding foreground contamination and possible systematic errors intrude in the analysis of current cmb data .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for the experiments dominating the fit near the peak , removing the foregrounds does not increase the error bars by more than @xmath5 .",
    "to account for foreground removal we have ( conservatively ) multiplied the errors in @xcite by 10% ( except for _ cobe _ ) .",
    "note that since @xcite , several experiments have reproduced earlier observations , indicating that systematic errors are not as severe as might have been thought . in one case",
    "however , that of the msam experiment @xcite , one of the two channels ( the `` single - difference '' ) showed a discrepancy . to be very conservative",
    "we have dropped this point from our analysis ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : the_data ] as the solid square at @xmath103 ) and updated the `` double - difference '' point to include the new data ( which is slightly lower than the older data ) .",
    "also we do not include the new data from the python experiment ( though we show it in fig .",
    "[ fig : the_data ] as the solid triangles with the small error bars @xcite ) since the points are correlated in an unknown way .",
    "as it is not the purpose of this paper to revisit the data analysis , especially without access to the latest data , we shall use the data set as tabulated in @xcite , with the simple modifications discussed above .",
    "one point deserves special mention . in @xcite",
    "we used symmetric error bars on all of the points .",
    "this is a conservative method if the inference is the presence of a peak , since most of the observations have skew positive error bars .",
    "however this leads to a slightly stronger than warranted _ upper _ limit on the height of the peak , and a slightly weaker lower limit .",
    "as most of the skewed likelihood functions have not been published in tabular or graphical form we have not tried to correct for this bias . since for most of the models under consideration ( especially the models with high @xmath40 ) the large - scale structure data is best fit with a tilt ( @xmath104 ) , this treatment remains the most conservative .",
    "a fit to the data as in @xcite , but with spectra generated from eq .",
    "[ eqn : tiltapp ] , gives a likelihood function for @xmath8 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nulik ] .",
    "here we have integrated , or marginalized , over the normalization @xmath105 , which is well fixed by _ cobe _",
    "the mean and standard deviation are @xmath106 . the absolute goodness of fit to both the _ cobe _ data alone @xcite and the other data @xcite",
    "show no indications that the fit should be suspect for purely _ statistical _ reasons .",
    "notice that this result has several immediate implications for structure formation models . that the preferred peak height is near that of a cdm model with scale invariant initial conditions puts a _ lower _ limit on the amount of tilt which can be accommodated @xcite .",
    "the lower limit clearly depends on the values of @xmath50 , @xmath15 and @xmath46 assumed , with lower @xmath50 and @xmath15 acting to loosen the constraint and lower @xmath46 acting to strengthen it .",
    "the probability of early reionization @xcite in these models will only tighten the lower limit on @xmath11 .    the increased height of the peak in low-@xmath50 models or models with @xmath107 can cause conflict with the _ upper _ limit on @xmath8 , unless the models are tilted , the baryon fraction is lowered or there is some reionization .",
    "we note in passing that for @xmath39cdm , some tilt is probably necessary to provide a good fit with the large scale structure data in any case @xcite . in general , while the degree scale data provide a strong constraint on models with high @xmath50 , the possibility of early reionization ( the degree scale power is exponentially sensitive to the very uncertain @xmath17 ) and the large uncertainty in @xmath46 from bbn significantly weaken the constraints from this data for low @xmath50 or @xmath49 models .",
    "in this paper we have compared the accuracy of spectra generated using the `` cosmic confusion '' @xcite assumption to those calculated using numerical evolution of the boltzmann hierarchy . for a range of parameters of current interest the spectra",
    "are found to agree to @xmath5 for all multipoles up to the first peak ( @xmath12 ) . over the same range",
    "the height of the peak is reproduced to @xmath108 . as pointed out by dodelson & kosowsky @xcite ,",
    "the presence of this degeneracy for scales greater than @xmath7 allows a simple statement of the parameter constraints arising from cmb data .",
    "given current data we find that @xmath8 ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : nudef ] ) is constrained to be @xmath106 . by limiting the amount of spectral tilt",
