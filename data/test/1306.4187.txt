    "this allows the dynamics of magnetization to be modeled in terms of the continuous landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation  @xcite , usually solved with micromagnetic techniques @xcite .",
    "the spatial resolution of such techniques is chosen in view of the problem at hand and numerical considerations , but the equation of motion is always the same . at the most fine - grained and microscopic end of the modeling spectrum",

    "this broken symmetry or low spin ( ls ) state , unlike the state with the highest spin ( hs ) , is not an eigenstate of the full spin operator ( hence the name ) .",
    "the exchange parameters are then determined as differences between the total energy , @xmath5 ( @xmath6  ls , hs ) , of the different spin state @xmath7 where different formulations of the spin - dependent function @xmath8 are possible , depending on the choice of basis and level of localization , and where @xmath9 is the expectation values of the local spin at atom @xmath10 ( see for instance references [ ] ) .    the first demonstration of laser - induced ultra - fast demagnetization  @xcite in transition metals , however , opened a new frontier , namely , the possibility of manipulating and controlling the magnetization with ultrashort intense laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "here one reaches the femtosecond time resolution , where both the exchange interaction and the anisotropy may become time - dependent .",

    "we will be able to extract exchange parameters , whose values are quantitatively rather close to those calculated with the broken symmetry approach .",

    ". this will be useful to interpret our tddft results . in the same section we will describe the general aspect of the tddft simulations and explain how to integrate the charge density in order to map the tddft results onto the heisenberg model .",

    "octopus provides an ideal environment for examining fundamental processes in the time - domain .",
    "our starting point to understand _ ab initio _ spin dynamics in the time - domain has to be through the simplest complexes of non - spin - singlet atoms .",

    "( [ jij ] ) was originally conceived , is the hydrogen molecule . in its ground state h@xmath11",
    "is closed - shell ( diamagnetic ) , but in the stretched dissociating state local spins can be defined for each of the hydrogen atoms ( e.g. in the broken symmetry ls state , the electrons localized on the opposite protons have particular and opposite spin expectation value , @xmath12 ) .",
    "hence the stretched h@xmath11 provides the simplest physical realization of a molecular spin dimer .    in order to excite spin dynamics in collinear spin - dimers ,",
    "we have introduced a spatial inhomogeneity into the magnetic field pulses available in octopus .",
    "thus , an inhomogeneous transverse magnetic field pulse of a few femptosecond duration is used to generate a spin misalignment in the dimer . in order to quantify such misalignment , we need a measure for the spin of overlapping atoms .",
    "although the tddft spin - density distribution is well - defined at every instance , the spin state ( and the charge ) of an individual atom in a molecule or solid is not an observable .",
    "this of course prevents us to rigorously map the tddft dynamics onto a classical heisenberg model .",
    "in fact , computing expectation values of local spin operators ( e.g. @xmath13 ) from _ ab initio _ wave functions is not a trivial task  @xcite and it has been recently shown that a continuum of valid local spin definitions exist  @xcite . in order to overcome such difficulty",
    "we have implemented an intuitive _ rotating spin _",
    "approximation for decomposing the spatial spin - density distribution into atomic contributions , which is based on defining an appropriate linear transformation .",
    "the idea is to use the two extreme states , the hs and ls spin - density distributions , as reference points for decomposing the spin - density of any given non - collinear spin - state obtained through tddft evolution , assuming that it is simply a result of rigid rotation of some portion of the spin distribution in space .",
    "we will demonstrate that such method allows us to practically eliminate from the definition of the local spins the dependence on a particular spatial volume and that this can be done for a wide range of interatomic distances .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to define with a unique criterion the local spin trajectories , and thus to extract an effective exchange parameter @xmath1 for the spin dimer .",

    "the deviation of the total energy from the heisenberg model ( @xmath141 ) can be attributed to a combination of factors .",

    "we find that the heisenberg spin interaction is the governing mechanism for the _ ab initio _ spin dynamics of stretched h@xmath11 , although with some deviations .",

    "as discussed above , the value of our dynamical heisenberg parameter , @xmath114 , depends strongly on the angle @xmath39 .",

    "the range is significant and it is relatively similar for all the bond - lengths . notably , broken symmetry lsda value at any distance is always well reproduced by our dynamical calculation for angles @xmath150 .",

    "in general our results for h - he - h are similar to those for h@xmath11 . again , after the application of the spatially - asymmetric magnetic field pulse the spins of the hydrogen electrons become misaligned by an angle @xmath39 and start to precess about the total spin at a steady angular frequency .",

    "the deviation from a perfect cosine dependence is much less pronounced than in the case of h@xmath11 ( although we find again some higher order harmonic contributions ) .",
    "the better agreement to a cosine function can be attributed both to the variation of the h - h distance in the two cases ( 2.6    for h@xmath11 and 3.2    for h - he - h ) and to the contribution of the superexchange spin - spin coupling mechanism @xcite .",
    "similarly , the profile of @xmath133 fits to @xmath154 better than in the case of h@xmath11 .",
    "in fact , by using only one additional harmonic to the fitting function , namely @xmath155 , we find @xmath146 [ see eq .",

    "this improvement is to a great extend due to the increased charge localization with inter - hydrogen distance of @xmath156    in h - he - h with respect to 2.6    for the h@xmath11 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig06](b ) ] . in fact , for the same small @xmath157 , the exchange interaction in h - he - h shows much more substantial deviation from the heisenberg model ( see the appendix ) . for the case of the larger distance of 3.3 ,",
    "the variation of @xmath114 between the hs and the ls spin is the same in sign and comparable in magnitude to the constained - spin dft result of peralta and barone @xcite .",

    "such convergence in not found for the case of h@xmath11 ( see fig .  [ fig07 ] ) .",
    "this means that our dynamical measure of the superexchange interaction in h - he - h suggests that this is much more heisenberg - like than the direct exchange operating in h@xmath11 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the spin dynamics of two simple spin - dimers , as calculated on the basis of tddft within the adiabatic lsda , is rather simple and understandable through a classical model .",
    "a non - collinear spin state can be created with inhomogeneous magnetic field pulses and this retains the non - collinearity in the long - time limit .",
    "the long - time spin dynamics is thus a harmonic precession in which the non - collinear spin - density rigidly revolves about the total spin of the dimer and all the relative angles remain constant in time .",
    "hence , the trajectories of the localised atomic - like spins , independently from their particular definition , map well onto the classical heisenberg model . in order for this mapping to be used for the extraction of heisenberg exchange parameters ,",
    "the actual definition of local spins is important .",
    "we have showed how a linear transformation , based on the hs and the ls collinear states and the direct integration of spin density over atomically - centered spheres , can be used to extract the directions of two localized spins .",
    "when defined in this way the latter are , to a good degree , independent of the integration sphere used for their definition .",
    "this also remains valid for the corresponding dynamically - defined exchange paremeter @xmath114 , for a range of distances where the overlap of the atomic wave - function is significant .",
    "such defined exchange parameters agree well with the results from constrained dft around the ls and the hs states and with broken symmetry total lsda energy results .",
    "we do acknowledge that the actual form of the exchange parameter depends on the choice of exchange and correlation functional used and that our dynamical method does not remedy the shortfall of local and semi - local functionals .",
    "we believe that the dynamical method highlighted in this paper , together with generating a quantitatively relevant estimate of @xmath1 , could potentially provide a straightforward verification for the applicability of the heisenberg spin model to any spin - polarized nano - scaled system .",

    "we elaborate here on the procedure for extracting the local spins and the exchange parameters for the h - he - h molecule .",
    "the leading exchange mechanism in this system is not the direct one , i.e. it does not necessarily depend on the degree of direct overlap of the atomic orbitals at the two magnetic sites .",
    "it is then not clear _ a priori _ whether the linear transformation used to eliminate the dependence on the wave - function overlap in h@xmath11 is transferable to this case .",
    "indeed , for h - he - h the spin - density snapshots in the long - time limit show a complex texture with multiple peaks and valleys around the he site and the interstitial regions ( see fig .",

    "[ fig12](a ) .",
    "this , however , is not the case and we find that the average variation between the actual density distributions of the ls and hs collinear states at any point in the simulation box is below 5% for @xmath161   . with this result at hand , we verify numerically that the linear transformation , described in section [ seclint ] , is still an adequate choice for the local spin definition even at relatively small interatomic distances .
