    "the study of stars is one of the most fascinating topics in astrophysics because it involves many areas of physics : gravitation , thermodynamics , hydrodynamics , statistical mechanics , quantum mechanics , relativity , ... and it has furthermore a very interesting history . in his classical monograph _ the internal constitution of the stars _ , eddington ( 1926 ) @xcite lays down the foundations of the subject and describes in detail the basic processes that govern the structure of ordinary stars . at that stage , only elements of `` classical '' physics are used and difficulties with such theories to account for the structure of high density stars such as the companion of sirius are pointed out .",
    "soon after the discovery of the quantum statistics by fermi ( 1926 ) @xcite and dirac ( 1926 ) @xcite , fowler ( 1926 ) @xcite uses this `` new thermodynamics '' to explain the puzzling nature of white dwarf stars .",
    "he understands that low mass white dwarf stars owe their stability to the quantum pressure of the degenerate electron gas . ) .",
    "the case of a partially degenerate self - gravitating fermi gas at arbitrary temperature has been discussed more recently by hertel & thirring ( 1971 ) @xcite and chavanis ( 2002 ) @xcite in the context of statistical mechanics .",
    "they describe the phase transition , below a critical temperature @xmath9 , from a gaseous configuration to a condensed state ( with a degenerate core surrounded by a halo ) .",
    "this provides a simple physical mechanism showing how the system can reach highly degenerate configurations as a result of gravitational collapse ; see chavanis ( 2006 ) @xcite for a review on phase transitions in self - gravitating systems . ]",
    "the resulting structure is equivalent to a polytrope of index @xmath10 so that the mass - radius relation of classical white dwarf stars behaves like @xmath11 ( chandrasekhar 1931a @xcite ) .",
    "the next step was made by chandrasekhar , aged only nineteen , who was accepted by the university of cambridge to work with fowler . in the boat that took him from madras to southampton @xcite",
    ", chandrasekhar understands that relativistic effects are important in massive white dwarf stars and that einstein kinematic must be introduced in the problem . in his first treatment ( chandrasekhar 1931b @xcite )",
    ", he considers the ultra - relativistic limit and shows that the resulting structure is equivalent to a polytrope of index @xmath12 .",
    "applying the theory of polytropic gas spheres ( emden 1907 @xcite ) , this leads to a unique value of the mass @xmath13 that he interprets as a limiting mass , nowdays called the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "quantum mechanics can not prevent the system from collapsing to a point .",
    "however , he did not take this collapse very seriously and noted that , in reality , there exists stars with mass @xmath14 that do not show this `` ridiculous tendency '' , so that they must possess regions in which the laws of quantum mechanics are violated . ] the complete mass - radius relation of relativistic white dwarf stars was given later ( chandrasekhar 1935 @xcite ) and departs from fowler s sequence as we approach the limiting mass . at this critical mass , the radius of the configuration vanishes .",
    "above the critical mass , the equation of state of the relativistic degenerate fermi gas of electrons is not able to balance gravitational forces and , when considering the final evolution of such a star , chandrasekhar ( 1934 ) @xcite `` left speculating on other possibility '' .",
    "chandrasekhar s result was severly criticized by eddington ( 1935 ) @xcite who viewed this result as _ a reductio ad absurdum _ of the relativistic formula and considered the combination of special relativity and non - relativistic quantum theory as an `` unholly alliance '' .",
    "because of the querelle with eddington , it took some time to realize the physical implication of chandrasekhar s results . however , progressively , his early investigations on white dwarf stars were extended in general relativity to the case of neutron stars ( oppenheimer & volkoff 1939 @xcite ) and finally led to the concept of `` black holes '' , a term coined by wheeler in 1967 . without the dispute with eddington , this ultimate stage of matter resulting from gravitational collapse could have been predicted much earlier from the discovery of chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "although these historic elements are well - known , it is less well - known that the concept of a maximum mass for relativistic white dwarf stars had been introduced earlier by anderson ( 1929 ) @xcite and stoner ( 1930 ) @xcite .",
    "these studies are mentioned in the early works of chandrasekhar but they have been progressively forgotten and are rarely quoted in classical textbooks of astrophysics .",
    "these authors investigated the equation of state of a relativistic degenerate fermi gas and predicted an upper limit for the mass of white dwarf stars .",
    "stoner ( 1930 ) @xcite uses a uniform mass density to model the star while chandrasekhar ( 1931 ) @xcite considers a more realistic @xmath12 polytrope .",
    "however , as noted in chandrasekhar ( 1931 ) @xcite , the value of the limiting mass found by stoner with his simplified model is relatively close to that obtained with the improved treatment .",
    "interestingly , nauenberg ( 1972 ) @xcite introduced long after a simplified treatment of relativistic white dwarf stars in order to obtain an analytical approximation of the mass - radius relation .",
    "it turns out that this model , which gives a very good agreement with chandrasekhar s numerical results ( up to some normalization factors ) , is similar to that introduced by stoner .",
    "leaving aside these interesting historical remarks , the result of chandrasekhar @xcite concerning the existence of a limiting mass is very profound because this mass can be expressed in terms of fundamental constants , similarly to the bohr radius of the hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "hence , the mass of stars is determined typically by the following combination @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the constant of gravity , @xmath17 the planck constant , @xmath18 the velocity of light and @xmath19 the mass of the hydrogen atom ( @xmath20 is the solar mass ) .",
    "this formula results from the combination of quantum mechanics ( @xmath17 ) , special relativity ( @xmath18 ) and gravity @xmath21 . since dimensional",
    "analysis plays a fundamental role in physics , it is of interest to investigate how the preceding results depend on the dimension of space @xmath1 of the universe . in our previous investigations @xcite , we considered the case of classical white dwarf stars in @xmath1 dimensions and found that they become unstable in a space of dimension @xmath8 . in that case , the star either evaporates or collapses",
    ". therefore , quantum mechanics can not stabilize matter against gravitational collapse in @xmath8 contrary to what happens in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this is similar to a result found by ehrenfest @xcite at the atomic level for coulomb forces in bohr s model and for the planetary motion ( kepler problem ) .",
    "the object of this paper is to extend these results to the case of relativistic white dwarf stars and exhibit particular dimensions of space which play a special role in the problem when we combine newtonian gravity , quantum mechanics and special relativity .",
    "we shall see that the problem is very rich and interesting in its own right .",
    "it shows to which extent the dimension @xmath4 of our universe is particular , with possible implications regarding the anthropic principle @xcite .",
    "we note that a similar problem has been considered in @xcite on the basis of dimensional analysis .",
    "our approach is more precise since we generalize the _ exact _ mathematical treatment of chandrasekhar @xcite to a space of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "a connection with other works investigating the role played by the dimension of space on the laws of physics is made in the conclusion . in appendix",
    "[ sec_stab ] , we propose different derivations of the stability limits of polytropic spheres and consider applications of these results to classical and relativistic white dwarf stars .",
    "following chandrasekhar @xcite , we model a white dwarf star as a degenerate gas sphere in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the pressure is due to the quantum properties of the electrons and the density to the protons . in the completely degenerate limit ,",
    "the electrons have momenta less than a threshold value @xmath22 ( fermi momentum ) and their distribution function is @xmath23 where @xmath17 is the planck constant .",
    "there can only be two electrons in a phase space element of size @xmath24 on account of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "therefore , the number of electrons per unit volume is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the surface of a unit sphere in @xmath1-dimensions .",
