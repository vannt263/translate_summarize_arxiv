    "the study of superfluid properties of fermi systems is one of the most interesting areas of research in the field of ultracold atoms because of direct implications for superconductivity in solid - state materials as well as for nuclear matter and other many - body quantum systems @xcite .",
    "an extremely important achievement in this field has been the realization of the crossover from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid phase of loosely bound pairs of fermions to the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of tightly bound composite bosons @xcite .",
    "the actual experimental realization of the crossover was made possible by the use of fano - feshbach resonances , a tool from atomic physics , with no counterpart in solid - state experiments , which allows to change at will the strength and sign of the interparticle interactions @xcite .",
    "several exciting research lines are now focused on fermi superfluids in low spatial dimensions , where quantum fluctuations are strongly enhanced and beyond - mean - field theories are needed to obtain a reliable description of the observed phenomena . while for one - dimensional ( 1d ) bosonic and fermionic systems with contact interaction there are exact analytical solutions @xcite , for two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum systems there are no exact solutions .",
    "in 2d systems with a continuous symmetry the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem precludes spontaneous symmetry breaking and condensation at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless critical temperature marks the transition from a superfluid phase characterized by quasi - condensation and algebraic long - range order to a normal phase , where vortex proliferation completely destroys superfluidity .",
    "as opposed to conventional off - diagonal long - range order typical of 3d superfluid systems , algebraic long - range order is driven by strongly enhanced quantum and thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "for this reason of particular relevance are studies aimed at understanding the pairing of fermions in strongly interacting 2d fermi gases , both in the homogeneous case and in the presence of an optical lattice .",
    "this subject is of great importance for condensed matter physics also in view of the not yet fully understood character of the corresponding mechanisms in high - temperature superconductors @xcite . strongly interacting fermi gases made of alkali - metal atoms in quasi-2d configurations",
    "have been realized only very recently @xcite and some evidences of superfluid behavior , such as the condensation of pairs @xcite and the algebraic decay of the first - order correlation function @xcite have been observed .",
    "however , genuine signatures of the superfluid state such as the second - sound mode are still missing .",
    "the first theoretical analysis of 2d fermi superfluid in the full bcs - bec crossover based on gaussian corrections to the mean - field equations was carried out very recently by our group both at zero @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and finite temperature @xcite .",
    "these 2d theoretical results @xcite are obtained performing the regularization of zero - point energy which appears in the gaussian fluctuations ( for a comprehensive review in any dimension see @xcite ) .",
    "the zero - point energy is due to both fermionic single - particle excitations and bosonic collective excitations , and its regularization ( dimensional regularization or convergence - factor regularization ) gives remarkable results in the full bcs - bec crossover and reliable analytical prediction in the bec regime of composite bosons , which are in extremely good agreement with @xmath0li experimental data of the zero - temperature equation of state in the crossover @xcite .     of the 2d gas of composite bosons as a function of the bosonic gas parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the pressure of an ideal 2d gas with @xmath3 the mass of each bosonic particle ( made of two fermions with mass @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 is the s - wave scattering length of bosons , and @xmath6 is the bosonic 2d density ( with @xmath7 the fermionic density ) . on the left",
    "there is the bec regime of deeply bound cooper pairs ( forming bosonic molecules ) while on the right there is the bcs regime of weakly bound cooper pairs .",
    "the filled squares with error bars are the experimental data of makhalov _ et al .",
    "the solid curves is obtained from the zero - temperature beyond - mean - field theory with renormalized gaussian fuctuations @xcite .",
    "notice that the mean - field theory ( dashed line ) predicts a completely wrong result : a constant pressure , independent of the scattering length . ]    in 2014 makhalov _",
    "_ @xcite have realized a quasi-2d fermi system with widely tunable s - wave interactions nearly in a ground state , investigating an ultracold gas of @xmath0li atoms by measuring the pressure @xmath8 as a function of the scattering length . the experiment @xcite covers physically different regimes corresponding to weakly or strongly attractive fermi gases or a bose gas of tightly bound pairs of fermions . in fig .",
    "1 we plot the pressure @xmath8 in units of the ideal pressure @xmath9 as a function of the adimensional gas parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath5 is the scattering length of composite bosons ( made of two fermions ) and @xmath10 is the bosonic density . in the full crossover",
    "the figure shows a very good agreement between the experimental data ( filled squares with error bars ) and our theoretical results ( solid curve ) based on zero - temperature beyond - mean - field theory with renormalized gaussian fluctuations @xcite .",
    "as previously stressed , the study of the 2d bcs - bec crossover is very interesting also for high - t@xmath11 superconductivity : the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors can be interpreted in terms of a bcs - bec crossover as doping is varied and the critical temperature t@xmath12 has a wide fluctuation region with pseudo - gap effects not yet fully understood @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been recently suggested that iron - based superconductors have composite superconductivity , consisting of strong - coupling bec in the electron band and weak - coupling bcs - like superconductivity in the hole band @xcite .",
    "the superfluid transition in two dimensions is of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type , featuring no true long - range coherence and making therefore the observation of the ordered state more subtle .",
    "a reliable microscopic analysis of the the bkt phase transition must include the quantization of circulation .",
    "this quantiziation is a peculiar consequence of the existence of an underlying compact real field , whose spatial gradient determines the local superuid velocity of the system .",
    "this compact real field , the so - called nambu - goldstone field , is the phase angle of the complex bosonic field which describes , in the case of attractive fermions , strongly - correlated cooper pairs of fermions with opposite spins @xcite .",
    "the compactess of the nambu - goldstone field implies the presence of quantized vortices and antivortices which regularize the superfludid density of the system as the temperature increases ( enhancement of thermal fluctuations ) @xcite .    by means of functional integration with renormalized gaussian fluctuations we have calculated the finite - temperature equation of state in the 2d bcs - bec crossover @xcite",
    "we have also derived the bare superfluid density @xcite and then we have renormalized it by using the kosterlitz s renormalization group equations @xcite : the renormalized superfluid density jumps discontinuously from a finite value to zero as the temperature reaches the bkt critical temperature . above @xmath13",
    "there is the unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs and the proliferation of free vortices @xcite .     as a function of the bound - state binding energy @xmath14 of cooper pairs . on the left",
    "there is the bcs regime characterized by a very small @xmath14 while on the right there is the bec regime characterized by a large @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the 2d fermi energy of the ideal two - component gas made of fermions with mass @xmath4 and number density @xmath7 .",
    "the dashed line is the result of renormalization group ( rg ) analysis on top of mean - field results , whereas the solid line uses the gaussian theory as the starting point for rg calculations .",
    "dots with error bars are the experimental data of ref . @xcite . ]",
    "our theoretical determination of the critical temperature @xmath13 across the whole crossover in reported in fig .",
    "2 ( solid line ) .",
    "the rapid decrease of @xmath13 approaching both the bcs and the bec limit is a consequence of the fermionic single - particle excitations and bosonic collective excitations dominating the superfluid density , respectively , rapidly decreasing the normal density as either limit is approached .",
    "a consequence of this interplay is that the critical temperature is higher in the intermediate regime ( @xmath16 ) , where the superfluid density is neither fermion - dominated nor boson - dominated .",
    "the current approach , involving the inclusion of gaussian fluctuations in the equation of state @xcite along with a renormalization group analysis @xcite , is able to reproduce the downward trend as the interaction get stronger ( i.e. by increasing the binding energy @xmath14 of cooper pairs ) . the renormalization group analysis on top of a mean - field theory is not sufficient to reproduce the correct trend , as shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 . in other words ,",
    "as also observed elsewhere @xcite , gaussian fluctuations are required in order to correctly describe the physics of an interacting fermi gas in the strongly - coupled limit .",
    "notice that that experimental data of fig .",
    "2 may be affected by errors larger than the bars .",
    "the algebraic decay of the first - order correlation function , presented in ref .",
    "@xcite as the signature of the superfluid state , could be interpreted in terms of the strong - coupling properties of a normal - state , as suggested in ref .",
    "moreover , in the experiment @xcite the fermionic superfluid is not trapped in a strictly 2d configuration .",
    "a complete understanding of the effects of quantum and thermal fluctuations on the critical temperature is of paramount importance for ultracold atoms physics but it is also of direct interest for engineering novel high - temperature superconductors .",
    "the results discussed here are a step towards a clear description of the behavior of the critical temperature of 2d fermi superfluids in the bcs - bec crossover . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the behavior of the critical temperature of 2d fermi superfluids both in the intermediate and strong - coupling regimes is still unknown and it is of primary importance to overcome this lack of knowledge , not only for ultracold atomic gases but also for high - t@xmath12 superconductors @xcite . more generally , the results and techniques developed for superfluid alkali - metal atoms are of direct interest for strictly related phenomena in quite different physical systems , for instance high - temperature superfluidity in double - bilayer graphene @xcite , bcs - bec in atomic nuclei @xcite , and color superconductivity in quark matter @xcite ."
