    "over the last two decades , cosmology has entered the stage of ` precision ' science , which involve significant improvements in observational techniques , implementation of more powerful statistical and mathematical tools , and , of course , greatly advanced computational facilities .",
    "while these advancements have yielded much new insight into the subject , many important questions still remain unanswered .",
    "the nature of dark energy has been the subject of much debate over the past decade @xcite .",
    "supernovae data , which gave the first indication of the accelerated expansion of the universe , are expected to elucidate this interesting question further , as the quality of the data steadily improves @xcite .",
    "much attention in recent years has focused on determining the properties of dark energy in a model independent manner .",
    "this can be done using either parametric @xcite or non - parametric methods @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive recent review has been given by @xcite .",
    "an earlier work by @xcite suggested a non - parametric method based on smoothing the supernova data over redshift in order to reconstruct cosmological quantities , including the expansion rate , @xmath0 , and the equation of state of dark energy , @xmath5 , in a _ model - independent _ manner . in this approach ,",
    "the data are dealt with directly , and one does not rely on a parametric functional form for fitting any of the quantities @xmath7 , @xmath0 or @xmath5 .",
    "the result obtained by using this approach is , therefore , expected to be model - independent .",
    "this method was shown to be successful in discriminating between different models of dark energy if the quality of data is commensurate with that expected from the future supernova acceleration probe ( snap ) . in this paper",
    "we improve the smoothing method and apply it to two recent sets of supernovae data : gold @xcite and snls @xcite .",
    "we then compare the derived expansion history of universe with the results of baryon acoustic peak observations @xcite .",
    "specifically , we use the improved smoothing method to reconstruct the hubble parameter , @xmath0 , and then derive the distance factor , @xmath1 , up to a redshift of @xmath2 independently of the assumption of any cosmological model .",
    "this derived value , based on supernovae data , is then compared with the distance factor @xmath1 ( which is also claimed to be relatively independent of dark energy model ) being determined by the detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation peak .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is that there is a good agreement between supernovae data ( both gold and snls ) and baryon acoustic peak observations for the values @xmath3 .",
    "the derived value of @xmath4 is then used to reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy for both supernovae datasets .",
    "we should emphasize here that all the results in this paper are only based on observational data and no theoretical model has been assumed .",
    "this is an advantage of this method over the functional fitting methods in which the reconstructed results are biased by an assumed functional form or a theoretical model .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly explain the smoothing method and we estimate the accuracy of the method based on the quality and the quantity of current datasets . in section",
    "iii we apply the smoothing method on the gold supernovae dataset and by using the results of detection of baryon acoustic oscillation peak , we reconstruct @xmath5 . in section iv , we carry out a similar treatment on the snls dataset .",
    "finally , in section v we discuss our results along with some concluding remarks .",
    "the method of smoothing belongs to the category of non - parametric methods of reconstruction which is complementary to the approach of fitting a parametric ansatz to the dark energy density or the equation of state .",
    "most papers using the non - parametric approach exploit a kind of top - hat smoothing in redshift space . instead , we follow a procedure which is well known and frequently used in the analysis of large - scale structure @xcite ; namely , we attempt to smooth noisy data directly using a gaussian smoothing function . in this method",
    "we apply gaussian smoothing to supernova data ( which are of the form @xmath8 ) in order to extract information about important cosmological parameters such as @xmath9 and @xmath5 .",
    "the smoothing algorithm calculates the luminosity distance at any arbitrary redshift @xmath10 to be    [ eq : bg ] d_l(z,)^s=  d_l(z)^g+n(z ) _ i & & +  exp , & & + n(z)^-1=_i exp  . & &    here @xmath11 is the smoothed luminosity distance at any redshift @xmath10 which depends on luminosity distances of each sne event with the redshift @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is a normalisation parameter . the quantity @xmath14 represents a guess background model which we subtract from the data before smoothing .",
    "this approach allows us to smooth noise only , and not the luminosity distance . after noise smoothing , we add back the guess model to recover the luminosity distance .",
    "this procedure is helpful in reducing noise in the results .",
    "since we do not know which background model to subtract , we may take as a reasonable guess that the data should be close to @xmath6cdm and use @xmath15 as a first approximation and then use a boot - strapping method to find successively better guess models .",
    "having obtained the smoothed luminosity distance , we differentiate it once to obtain the hubble parameter , [ eq : hubb ] h(z)= ^-1 , and once again to obtain the equation of state of dark energy @xmath5 , [ eq : w ] w(z)=.    in any kind of smoothing scheme for the luminosity distance , some bias is introduced both in @xmath16 and in derived quantities like @xmath9 and @xmath5 ( see appendix a1 in @xcite to find detailed calculations of the bias ) .",
    "it is important to choose a value of @xmath17 which gives a small value of the bias and also reasonably small errors on derived cosmological parameters . to estimate the value of @xmath17 in ( [ eq : bg ] )",
    ", we consider the following relation between the reconstructed results , quality and quantity of the data and the smoothing parameters .",
    "one can show that the relative error bars on @xmath9 scale as @xcite [ eq : tegmark ] , where n is the total number of supernovae ( for approximately uniform distribution of supernovae over the redshift range ) and @xmath18 is the noise of the data . from the above equation",
    "we see that a larger number of supernovae or larger width of smoothing , @xmath17 , will decrease the error bars on the reconstructed @xmath19 , but as it has been reported earlier @xcite , the bias of the method is approximately related to @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that by increasing @xmath17 we will also increase the bias of the results . if we attempt to estimate @xmath17 such that @xmath21 , then for @xmath22 data points ( which is the number of data points in the gold sample ) , we get @xmath23 for a single iteration of our method . however , with each iteration , the errors on the parameters will increase . therefore , using this value of @xmath17 when we use an iterative process to find the guess model will result in such large errors on the cosmological parameters as to render the reconstruction exercise meaningless .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that at the m - th iteration , the error on @xmath24 will be approximately @xmath25 , and the error on @xmath24 scales as @xmath26 .",
    "we would like the errors after @xmath27 iterations to be commensurate with the optimum errors obtained for a single iteration , @xmath28 , so we require @xmath29 . therefore , if we wish to stop the boot - strapping after @xmath30 iterations , then @xmath31 . however ,",
    "after this rough estimation of the values of @xmath17 and @xmath27 , we can still play around these values to find the best combination , by minimising the likelihood of the reconstructed results to the data . in the following ,",
    "we use @xmath32 and we calculate the @xmath33 of the reconstructed distance moduli to the data after each iteration , and we stop the boot - strapping process after reaching the minimum value of @xmath33 . this effect ,",
    "that @xmath33 of the reconstructed results goes to a minimum value and increases again with iteration is a reflection of the problem of some iterative reconstruction algorithms which are not error - sensitive . in these cases",
    "the noise will be added to the reconstructed results after certain number of iterations and the iterative process should be stopped after reaching the minimum value of @xmath33 to get the best result .",
    "similar effect has been reported and studied in the richardson - lucy deconvolution algorithm to reconstruct the form of primordial power spectrum from cmb data @xcite .    in appendix",
    "a we show that the results are not sensitive to the chosen value of @xmath17 and also to the assumed initial guess model .",
    "the recently released gold sample @xcite , consist of 182 supernovae type ia which have been gathered from five different subsets of data , observed during the last 16 years .",
    "the range of redshift for these supernovae are between @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in this section",
    "we use this dataset to reconstruct @xmath0 , estimate the value of @xmath4 , and then reconstruct @xmath5 .",
    "we choose a flat @xmath6cdm model with @xmath36 as the initial guess model in our calculation and we fix the value of @xmath17 ( width of smoothing ) to be @xmath37 . after each iteration , we compute the @xmath33 and we stop the boot - strapping process once @xmath33 reaches its minimum value .    the @xmath33 at any iteration is calculated from the formula , [ eq : chis ] ^2_rec , j(h_0 ) = _ i and is followed by marginalising over @xmath38 .",
    "we have marginalised over @xmath38 by integrating over the probability density @xmath39 for all values of @xmath38 .    in eq.[eq :",
    "chis ] , @xmath40 is the reconstructed result at the @xmath41th iteration for the distance moduli at redshift @xmath12 , assuming the value of @xmath38 , and @xmath42 is the gold sample data given by @xcite . in figure [ chi_gold ]",
    "we show the @xmath33 of the reconstructed results at different iterations , after marginalising over @xmath38 .",
    "as we see , the @xmath33 has a minimum around @xmath43 and after this , @xmath33 is slowly increasing .",
    "so we stop the boot - strapping process at this iteration and determine @xmath0 .",
    "we can also see that for the initial guess @xmath6cdm model , the @xmath44 of the best recovered result is less than @xmath45 which means that the flat @xmath6cdm model is in agreement with the gold sample within @xmath46 .    by marginalizing over the hubble parameter ,",
    "we carry out a similar treatment on the data as it has been done by @xcite to calculate the @xmath33 for different cosmological models .",
    "as the gold data are based on a hubble parameter of 65 km / sec / mpc , the reconstruction method should be able to recover this value for the hubble constant .",
    "in fact the peak of the probability density of the reconstructed result for different values of the hubble parameter should be close to @xmath47 65 km / sec / mpc . in figure [ h_margin_gold ]",
    "we show the probability density of the best reconstructed result from gold data for different values of the hubble parameter .",
    "we see that the probability density has a sharp peak around @xmath4765 km / sec / mpc .",
    "we should also note here , that the reduced @xmath33 of the reconstructed results seems to be consistently below @xmath48 ( however it is not trivial to define the degree of freedom in our smoothing method and hence the reduced @xmath33 , but we can see that the resultant @xmath33 of the reconstructed results is around @xmath49 less than the number of data points ) .",
    "we can also see in figure [ chi_gold ] that the reduced @xmath33 of the first initial guess model , which is a @xmath6cdm model , is also below @xmath48 .",
    "it shows that the error - bars of the supernovae data points are quite large and many different reconstructed results may have a reduced @xmath33 of less than @xmath48 . in this paper",
    "we only calculate the @xmath33 of the reconstructed results and we compare different results by calculating the @xmath44 to the best result with a minimum @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath50    \\includegraphics[scale=0.38 , angle=-90]{h_gold_riess.ps }    \\includegraphics[scale=0.38 , angle=-90]{q_gold.ps } \\end{array}$ ]    @xmath50    \\includegraphics[scale=0.38 , angle=-90]{bao_gold_err.ps }    \\includegraphics[scale=0.38 , angle=-90]{w_gold.ps } \\end{array}$ ]    in figure [ h_gold ] , left panel , we show the reconstructed @xmath0 for the gold data set .",
    "the red solid line has the highest likelihood and is our best reconstruction .",
    "all the other lines are within @xmath51 away from the best recovered result .",
    "these lines are recovered results from our smoothing method by using different numbers of iterations in the boot - strapping process .",
    "the @xmath44 for all of these lines is less than @xmath48 , and so we can consider them to lie within @xmath51 of the best result . we should note that these green dashed lines in figure [ h_gold ] are in fact a non - exhaustive sample of results which are within @xmath51 away from the best recovered result . as we see in the figure [ h_gold ] , the reconstructed @xmath0 at high redshift has a very big degeneracy .",
    "this is expected since there is only a single supernova beyond redshift @xmath52 !    in this figure",
    "we can also see 3 uncorrelated and independent measurements of @xmath0 from the gold sample ( blue dotted crosses from @xcite ) for comparison with our results .",
    "we can see that these two results are consistent with each other within their @xmath51 limits .",
    "however we should mention here that in the @xcite method used by @xcite for uncorrelated estimates of the expansion history , there is a slight bias in the reconstruction of @xmath0 and the higher derivatives of the data .",
    "it is mainly because of using the average of the measured quantity @xmath53 , which typically is not a straight line .",
    "so as it has been mentioned in @xcite , the measured average of @xmath53 ( and hence @xmath0 ) over a redshift bin will generally lie either slightly above or below the actual curve at the bin center .",
    "this can be the reason that why the centres of the crosses in figure [ h_gold ] , left panel , for uncorrelated estimates of the expansion history , are slightly above or below our reconstructed curve for the @xmath0 .    to reconstruct the hubble parameter , @xmath0",
    ", we do not need to know the value of @xmath4 .",
    "another important cosmological quantity which we can derive from the reconstructed @xmath0 ( independent of the value of @xmath4 ) , is the deceleration parameter , @xmath54 ,    [ eq : q ] q(z)=(1+z ) -1 .    in figure",
    "[ h_gold ] , right panel , we show reconstructed @xmath54 . for the gold data",
    "our method shows that the transition between deceleration and acceleration occurred at @xmath55 ( at @xmath51 ) .",
    "the best reconstruction shows the redshift of transition to be @xmath56 .",
    "this is in agreement with results obtained using parametric methods @xcite .    to derive the equation of state of dark energy @xmath5",
    ", one needs to know the value of @xmath4 , as we see in eq.[eq : w ] . to estimate the value of @xmath4 , without using any parameterisation and in a model - independent way",
    ", we can use the results of the detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation peak @xcite .",
    "the distance factor @xmath1 up to redshift @xmath2 , measured by observation of luminous red galaxies in detection of baryon acoustic oscillation peak ( which have been claimed to be relatively independent of the model of dark energy ) , can be derived directly for different values of @xmath4 by using the reconstructed @xmath0 , a =  _ 0^z_1  ^2/3  , where the measured value of @xmath1 is @xmath57 at @xmath58 . the 3-year wmap results , when combined with the results of baryon acoustic oscillations , yield @xmath59 for the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum @xcite . by using the best reconstructed results for @xmath0 , we get @xmath60 . in figure",
    "[ w_gold ] , left panel , we see the derived value of @xmath61 from supernovae data in comparison with its measured value from observation of lrgs for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that these two independent observations which are completely different by nature , are very much in agreement if @xmath62 .",
    "this derived value of @xmath4 is completely independent of any dark energy model assumption ( within the framework of standard general relativity ) and is in very close agreement with the results from large scale structure measurements from 2df @xcite and sdss @xcite .",
    "this derived value of @xmath4 is also in good agreement with the results from @xcite , where a different model - independent method of reconstruction has been used .    now by marginalising over @xmath63 , which is the range of agreement between the two observations",
    ", we can reconstruct @xmath5 from our previously reconstructed @xmath0 . in figure [ w_gold ] , right panel , we show the reconstructed @xmath5 , marginalised over @xmath4 for the gold dataset .",
    "we see that the data prefer evolving dark energy to the cosmological constant .",
    "the degeneracy for the equation of state of dark energy at high redshifts is very large and it is almost impossible to say much about @xmath5 at high redshifts .",
    "in this section we use the same procedure as we used in the previous section to deal with snls supernovae data .",
    "the snls dataset contains 115 data points in the range of @xmath64 .",
    "we use this dataset , first to reconstruct the hubble parameter , @xmath0 , and the deceleration factor , @xmath54 , up to redshift @xmath48 .",
    "then by using the results of detection of baryon acoustic oscillation peak we derive the value of @xmath4 , following which we recover the form of @xmath5 .",
    "we use the distance modules of the supernovae available in tables 8 and 9 in @xcite as our dataset in this section .    in figure [ chi_snls ]",
    "we see the computed @xmath33 for the reconstructed results using smoothing method at each iteration . as we see",
    ", the @xmath33 diverges to its minimum value very fast at just the 5th iteration . in figure [ h_snls ]",
    "we show the reconstructed @xmath0 ( left panel ) and @xmath54 ( right panel ) for the snls dataset . the red solid line has the best likelihood , which is our best reconstructed result .",
    "all the other lines are within @xmath51 away from the best recovered result .",
    "we should like to emphasise here that these results ( green dashed lines ) are not representative of all the possibilities which give the likelihood within @xmath51 of the best recovered result .",
    "however they can show the overall behaviour of the quantities which we have studied .",
    "our results for snls data show that the transition from deceleration to acceleration phase of the universe occurs at redshifts higher than @xmath65 .",
    "the fact that we can not put an upper limit to the redshift of the commence of acceleration is due to the absence of supernovae data at @xmath66 in snls dataset .",
    "as we have discussed earlier in the previous section , we use the results of detection of baryon acoustic oscillation peak to determine the value of @xmath4 .",
    "then by marginalising over the recovered value of @xmath4 , we derive the dynamics of @xmath5 . in figure [ w_snls ]",
    "we see the derived value of @xmath4 and the reconstructed form of @xmath5 .",
    "we see that the @xmath6cdm model is in much better agreement with snls data than with gold data .    by comparing the recovered results from the snls and gold datasets , we can clearly see an inconsistency between these two supernovae datasets .",
    "this inconsistency is obvious by looking at the reconstructed @xmath54 and @xmath5 in the middle and high redshift ranges .",
    "gold data suggest the redshift of the commencement of acceleration at @xmath56 while snls data suggest @xmath67 .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath5 from these two datasets also shows a very different behavior in the middle and high redshift ranges .",
    "the discord between gold and snls supernovae datasets has been reported and studied earlier by @xcite , and a similar discord between gold supernovae data and other cosmological observations like cosmic microwave background observations from wmap and observations of cluster abundance , has also been reported earlier by @xcite .",
    "however snls supernovae data seem to be in good agreement with the other cosmological observations . based on all these results and analyses",
    ", we may conclude that some significant systematics in the gold data ( or in a part of the data ) might be the reasos for these inconsistencies .",
    "interestingly , the recovered values of @xmath4 from gold and snls data ( by using the results of detection of baryon acoustic oscillation peak ) , are in very close agreement . in both cases",
    "the derived value of @xmath4 is around @xmath68 .",
    "we should note here that the two data sets rely on pretty much the same nearby supernovae samples and that is why the results are similar in this range .",
    "it is something which we logically expect to get .",
    "but in fact it shows one of the advantages of this method over the functional fitting methods . by using a functional fitting method",
    ", the recovered results at any redshift would be equally dependent on the data set in the whole redshift range . but here , by using our smoothing method , we can clearly see that despite the significant differences between the reconstructed results from gold and snls datasets in the middle and high redshift regions , the reconstructed results for the expansion history at low redshifts ( which we use to estimate the value of matter density ) , are not affected by the big differences between the two datasets at the higher redshifts .",

    "in this paper we have shown that by improving the efficacy of the smoothing method @xcite , we can reconstruct the expansion history of the universe in a model - independent way , using current supernovae data .",
    "we have used the smoothing method to reconstruct the expansion history of the universe , @xmath0 , the deceleration parameter , @xmath54 , the value of @xmath4 and the equation of state of dark energy , @xmath5 , independently of any assumption of the theoretical model of the universe , within the framework of standard general relativity .",
    "this is an advantage of this method over the functional fitting methods where the results are usually biased by the form of the functional fitting or the assumed theoretical model .",
    "we dealt with two recent datasets , gold and snls in our analysis . in determining the value of @xmath4 , we found excellent agreement between gold and snls datasets .",

    "we have got @xmath70 for both gold and snls datasets , which is in good agreement with results of sdss and 2df large scale structure observations , and also with results of recent chandra x - ray observations of the relaxed galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "this derived value of @xmath4 also agree with the recent wmap 3 years cmb data , if we assume the broken scale invariant spectrum for the form of the primordial spectrum @xcite . in the derivation of @xmath54 and the stage of transition from deceleration to acceleration in the dynamics of the universe , we found disagreement between gold and snls datasets .",
    "gold data suggest the redshift of the commence of acceleration at @xmath56 while snls data suggest @xmath67 .",
    "after marginalizing over the derived value of @xmath4 , we have reconstructed @xmath5 .",
    "the inconsistency between gold and snls supernovae datasets is also obvious by looking at the reconstructed @xmath5 from these two datasets .",
    "the derived form of @xmath5 from snls dataset , is in good concordance with @xmath6cdm model , while gold dataset prefers an evolving form of dark energy ( however @xmath6cdm is still in agreement with the gold dataset to within @xmath46 ) .",
    "this discrepancy between gold and snls datasets has been reported earlier by other groups ( @xcite ) .",
    "as the gold sample is also relatively in disagreement with the other cosmological observations like cmb and observations of cluster abundance ( @xcite ) , we may conclude that the effect of systematics in the gold dataset ( or at least in a part of the data ) is significant .",
    "the large error - bars at the high redshifts for the reconstructed results , reflect the significant lack of data points .",
    "this effect may not be seen if we use some of the parametric methods of analysis , but as we deal with the data directly here , we notice that the lack of data points at high redshifts limits our ability to say much about the behavior of the universe at the early stages at high redshifts .",
    "this is another important feature of our smoothing method in which the reconstructed results at any redshift rely mostly on the supernovae data points at the same redshift range .",
