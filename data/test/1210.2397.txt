    "one of the continuing mysteries in the studies of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is the structure and kinematics of the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that agn are powered by supermassive black holes , and the broad emission lines seen in type 1 agn are the result of the photoionization of gas in the blr . under the assumption that this gas is in virial motion around the black hole ,",
    "we can use it to measure the mass of the black hole itself .",
    "however , it is impossible to study the structure of the blr directly because the blr is on the order of light - days in radius , which renders it spatially unresolvable even in the nearest of galaxies with the largest diffraction - limited telescopes .",
    "the unknown blr structure introduces uncertainties in any black hole mass measurements derived from blr gas kinematics . to learn about the blr structure",
    ", we must rely on either reverberation mapping techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ) or microlensing of gravitationally lensed quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "reverberation techniques use the time variability observed in the agn continuum emission and the subsequent response of the gas in the blr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . by monitoring the agn spectra over a period of time",
    ", we can determine the distance of the emitting gas from the central source by measuring the time delay between variations in the continuum and the response of the emission lines .",
    "this time delay is due to the light - travel time between the continuum source and the blr .",
    "the variations in the blr emission - line flux , @xmath2 , are a convolution of the continuum flux variations , @xmath3 , with the `` transfer function '' , @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the transfer function depends on the temporal lag @xmath5 between the line and continuum emission , and the line - of - sight velocity @xmath6 of the blr gas .",
    "the relationship is expressed mathematically as @xmath7 a main goal of reverberation mapping is to recover @xmath4 , called the `` velocity - delay map '' , which describes how the continuum flux variations give rise to blr flux variations , and therefore contains information about the blr geometry and kinematics .",
    "for example , a keplerian disk produces a velocity - symmetric structure with a wider / narrower range of velocities at smaller / larger delays .",
    "in contrast , radial flows give rise to asymmetric velocity structure , the signature of infall / outflow being smaller delays on the red / blue side of the velocity profile .",
    "most previous reverberation studies have been limited to measuring the mean time delay @xmath8 for various emission lines .",
    "this allows us to estimate the mean radius of the blr ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but it reveals very little information about the detailed structure of the blr .    it has long been recognized that measuring emission - line time lags as a function of line - of - sight velocity provides a way to determine the gross kinematics of the blr ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , although it is only relatively recently that suitable data have become available to achieve this in practice . there were a number of early attempts to extract velocity - dependent time lags in emission lines in order to probe the blr kinematics , though these were generally frustrated by low data quality , time - sampling issues , or both .",
    "the first attempts that we are aware of to search for velocity - dependent lags were by @xcite for ngc4151 and @xcite for fairall 9 , in both cases for the civ@xmath9 emission line based on data obtained with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( a mean lag for fairall 9 had been obtained earlier by @xcite ) . in both cases , detection of infall was claimed .",
    "we have , however , reanalyzed both of these data sets using more modern methods and find that the light curves are far too poorly sampled to support either claim of a detection of infall .",
    "later , @xcite revisited the case of ngc4151 with improved time sampling . to within the accuracy of their measurement",
    ", they found the red and blue wings of civ  to vary simultaneously . however , their mean sampling interval of 3.4 days was only slightly smaller than the civ  mean response time , which would have made it difficult to detect the subtle velocity - dependent lags that have been detected in optical lines in recent years ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first well - sampled agn emission - line light curves became available as a result of intensive monitoring of ngc5548 with _ iue _ ( @xcite ) and ground - based telescopes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in 198889 .",
    "these data led to the first successful attempts to recover one - dimensional delay maps , @xmath10 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "other attempts were also made to search for velocity - dependent lags ( e.g. , @xcite , for ngc5548 ) , but they generally concluded that any velocity - dependent lags remained unresolved .",
    "however , @xcite argued that civ profile variations during part of the 198889 campaign on ngc5548 indicated infall of blr gas , although an infall signature was not detected using any other subset of the campaign data and the _ iue _ spectra were generally rather marginal for agn emission - line profile studies .",
    "other sources were searched for velocity - dependent emission - line responses , but these searches were also unsuccessful ( e.g. , @xcite ) . some limited success was achieved with both space - based observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and ground - based data ( @xcite ) , but except in the case of ngc4151 ( @xcite ) the resulting velocity - delay maps showed little clear structure .",
    "there was also a growing understanding that the dramatic emission - line profile variations observed in some sources were not a reverberation effect ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and that reverberation signals were generally going to be weak .",
    "obtaining a high - fidelity velocity  delay map was going to require both high - quality data and excellent temporal sampling ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recent spectroscopic monitoring campaigns for reverberation - mapping have been specifically designed to , among other things , recover velocity - delay maps ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these efforts have already been shown to be successful  @xcite show well - resolved velocity - delay maps for arp 151 using maximum - entropy methods , and @xcite used dynamical modeling ( first described by @xcite ) to recover blr structure information in mrk 50 .    in late 2010 , we carried out a four - month long reverberation mapping campaign with the ultimate goal of recovering velocity - delay maps for several of the targets .",
    "details of the data processing , light curves , mean time lags , and black hole mass measurements for these objects were published by @xcite . here",
    "we present velocity - binned reverberation results for all five objects observed in our 2010 campaign and two - dimensional velocity - delay maps for four objects .",
    "all five targets and their coordinates and redshifts are listed in table [ table : obj_info ] . while our reverberation campaign was aimed primarily at investigating the h@xmath0  emission line , in a few cases we recover velocity - delay maps for the h@xmath11 and ii4686 heii@xmath1  emission lines as well .",
    "for this study we use spectroscopic and photometric data obtained during our reverberation campaign carried out at multiple institutions in late 2010 .",
    "the primary set of spectra were obtained using the boller and chivens ccd spectrograph on the mdm 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope on kitt peak .",
    "we supplemented our spectroscopic continuum light curves with photometry from the 46-cm centurion telescope at wise observatory of tel - aviv university and the 70-cm telescope at the crimean astrophysical observatory ( crao ) , and with spectra obtained from the 2.6 m shajn telescope at crao .",
    "all data were obtained between 2010 august 21 and 2011 january 7 .",
    "the data processing is described in detail in @xcite . in short",
    ", we calibrated the reduced spectra onto an absolute flux scale by assuming that the flux in the narrow [ oiii]@xmath12  emission line is constant .",
    "we created a reference spectrum for each object using the spectra taken on photometric nights during the campaign .",
    "we then used the procedure of @xcite to apply small wavelength shifts and scale each individual spectrum to match the flux in the [ oiii]@xmath12  emission line in the reference spectrum using a @xmath13 goodness - of fit estimator method .",
    "the resulting scaled spectra were used to create the driving continuum light curves used throughout our analysis as well as the light curves used in our velocity - binned time series analysis .",
    "as a preliminary step , we first searched for gross kinematic signatures by seeing if different parts of each emission line show different time delays with respect to the continuum .",
    "following @xcite , we divided the h@xmath0  emission line into velocity bins as follows : first , we divide the h@xmath0  emission lines in half at the zero - velocity line center ( the systemic redshift ) , to separate red - shifted and blue - shifted signals .",
    "we then divide each line half into bins containing equal flux in the rms residual spectrum , choosing the number of bins for each object based on the width of the rms line profiles .",
    "we create light curves for individual bins by integrating the flux within each bin in each scaled spectrum .",
    "the resulting light curves were analyzed using javelin , the updated version of spear ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) , to measure the time delay in each light curve with respect to the continuum light curve .",
    "in essence , javelin uses a statistical model of the continuum light curve and its covariances and simultaneously fits the continuum and line light curves assuming a simple top - hat transfer function .",
    "this leads to a statistically well - defined means of interpolating the irregularly sampled line and continuum data that essentially averages over all possible interpolated light curves weighted by their likelihood of fitting the data .",
    "in particular , the model fills gaps in the light curves in a well - defined manner with well - defined uncertainties .",
    "our results from javelin are shown in figure [ fig : velres ] .",
    "the top panels show the rms residual line profile and the wavelength bins , and the bottom panel shows the distribution of lags for each part of the emission line . as a check , we also ran the light curves for each bin through a cross correlation analysis routine that is widely used in reverberation mapping ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the lags from the cross correlation were nearly identical to the ones obtained from javelin .",
    "we show here only the javelin results , since the javelin uncertainties are much smaller than those obtained through cross correlation methods and the overall signatures are the same . in all five objects ,",
    "we see velocity - dependent time lags in the h@xmath0emission line .",
    "mrk 335 , mrk 1501 , and pg2130 + 099 all show longer time lags on the blue side of the line profile than on the red side , which is a signature of inflowing gas .",
    "by contrast , 3c120 shows a nearly symmetric profile , with small lags in the outer wings , and larger lags towards the line center , which is suggestive of a disk .",
    "mrk 6 shows more complex structures that could be a combination of a disk plus infall , as previously suggested by @xcite for this object .",
    "to recover the velocity - delay maps , we used maximum entropy methods as implemented in the program memecho ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) . to prepare the data for use with memecho , we used software developed by keith horne called prepspec",
    ". prepspec applies corrections to account for wavelength shifts due to instrument flexure and differential refraction , spectrul blurring due to seeing and instrumental resolution , and errors due to slit losses and changes in atmospheric transmission between epochs . to do this",
    ", we fit a calibration model to the spectra that accounts for both the spectral variability and the abovementioned systematic errors .",
    "we model the spectra as the sum of five different components : 1 ) a constant `` mean '' spectrum , which accounts for non - varying components of the continuum and broad emission lines as well as starlight from the host galaxy , 2 ) non - varying narrow emission lines , 3 ) a time - variable continuum , 4 ) time variable broad emission lines , and 5 ) factors to account for wavelength shift , spectral blurring , and scaling . after subtracting the models from the spectra ,",
    "the resulting continuum - subtracted line profile variations are used as inputs to memecho .      in brief",
    ", memecho finds the `` simplest '' linearized echo model that fits the observed continuum and emission - line spectral variations .",
    "this is accomplished by minimizing the function @xmath14 for a given model fit to a set of data . here",
    "@xmath13 measures the `` badness - of - fit '' between @xmath15 data points with values @xmath16 and the corresponding model predictions @xmath17 for those values , assuming gaussian errors with known variances @xmath18 .",
    "the entropy @xmath19 measures the `` simplicity '' of the model , elaborated below , and the regularization parameter @xmath20 controls the trade - off between these competing requirements .",
    "memecho adjusts @xmath20 and the model parameters @xmath21 to achieve a user - specified value of @xmath22 while maximizing @xmath19 .    in memecho",
    "s linearized echo model @xmath23 the parameters @xmath21 include the continuum light curve @xmath24 on an evenly spaced grid , the delay map at each wavelength @xmath25 , and the time - independent background spectrum @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is a reference continuum level , which we set at the median of the continuum light curve data .",
    "the entropy of the model is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are weights , @xmath21 are the positive parameters outlined above , and @xmath30 are the default values of these parameters .",
    "note that @xmath19 is maximized when @xmath31 .",
    "minimizing @xmath32 gives @xmath33 thus the model parameters @xmath21 are pulled by the data toward @xmath34 and by the entropy toward @xmath31 , with @xmath20 adjusting the trade - off between the two . with default values",
    "@xmath35 , the entropy `` pulls '' each @xmath21 toward the geometric mean of its neighbors , so that the entropy penalizes regions of high curvature and favors smooth functions with gaussian features and exponential tails .",
    "the weights @xmath29 and default values @xmath30 are assigned with two parameters in memecho : @xmath36 to stiffen @xmath25 relative to @xmath24 , and @xmath37 to control the aspect ratio of features in @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath36 parameters are set by the user .",
    "their qualitative effects on the velocity - delay maps are described below in section [ sec : aandw ] .",
    "one of the major practical issues with the use of memecho is its tendency to introduce spurious features at gaps in the continuum light curve to drive @xmath22 to the minimum value set by the user .",
    "this becomes a significant problem as the target @xmath22 decreases .",
    "altering memecho parameters to stiffen ( i.e. , penalize rapid variations in ) the driving light curve is sometimes helpful , but we were still unable to produce velocity - delay maps with any discernible structure using the original continuum light curves . to provide stronger constraints on the driving light curve model",
    ", we ran our full continuum light curves ( including both spectroscopic and photometric data ) through the javelin modeling software of @xcite .",
    "this method models the continuum with a damped random walk ( drw ) model that has been demonstrated to be a good statistical model of agn variability ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this allowed us to create highly sampled _ simulated _ continuum light curves with reliable uncertainties that represent the range of the most likely continuum behavior within the gaps . instead of providing memecho with our original continuum light curve , we use our highly sampled javelin mean light curve , which more strongly constrains the memecho continuum model .",
    "this light curve is the probability - weighted mean of drw light curves consistent with the data and the drw model .",
    "uncertainties on each point in the simulated light curve represent the standard deviation of probable light curves around this mean .",
    "these narrow to match the measurement errors of the data points and then broaden as the gaps between the data become larger .",
    "the variability observed in the adopted mean simulated light curve is somewhat smoothed compared to an individual drw model realization , but the error envelope applied to the mean light curve , representing the 1@xmath38 deviations of the individual realizations about the mean , accounts for these differences .",
    "the original continuum light curves and their corresponding simulated light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : javmodels ] .    using the javelin mean continuum light curve allows us to fit the variability of both the continuum and the rest of the spectrum to much higher degrees of accuracy and keep memecho from introducing spurious features into our light curves and by extension , into the derived echo maps .",
    "light curves , 1-dimensional memecho fits , and recovered delay maps at selected wavelengths are shown in figures [ fig : mrk335fits]-[fig : pg2130fits ] for all five objects .",
    "the wavelengths for the fits and delay maps shown in these figures were chosen to show the response in the red and blue wings as well as at the center of each emission line .",
    "one thing to note is that using the probability - weighted mean as the constraint on the memecho construction of the continuum means that we are over - smoothing the light curves because we are neglecting the covariance of light curve deviations from the mean , which may weaken short - timescale variability .",
    "this will also cause some difficulty in the fitting , as it can force the light curve models to be smoother than the data . at the same time , the @xmath22 value reported by memecho is no longer strictly valid  the deviations of any particular light curve model from the `` mean '' continuum light curve are highly correlated , so , for example , having 10 consecutive points 1@xmath38 from the light curve model is likely a 1@xmath38 deviation , not a 10@xmath38 deviation .",
    "however , the velocity - delay maps do not change significantly if we use random individual drw realizations of the light curve instead of the mean , indicating that the mean light curve can be used to produce accurate velocity - delay maps . while this solution is not ideal , it is currently the best method we have of dealing with gaps in the observed continuum light curves pending a major effort to integrate the two distinct software packages ( javelin and memecho ) .",
    "we were able to recover velocity - delay maps with memecho for four out of the five galaxies observed .",
    "the best maps are for 3c120 and mrk 335 , while the ones obtained for pg2130 + 099 and mrk 1501 are somewhat less well - defined .",
    "the light curves for mrk 6 , on the other hand , do not seem to be well - fit by a simple echo model , and we were therefore unable to obtain two - dimensional velocity - delay maps for this object .",
    "figure [ fig : mrk6fits ] shows the best model fits we were able to obtain for mrk 6 . while there is some evidence for velocity - dependent structure in the one - dimensional delay maps shown , the models do not successfully fit any of the short - term variations seen in this object .",
    "we were unable to improve the light curve fits by lowering the target @xmath22 , as memecho was unable to converge on a solution when we did so .",
    "the best - fit velocity - delay maps for the other four objects , covering the full observed wavelength range for each , are shown in figure [ fig : veldelay ] .",
    "the parameters used in memecho to create the velocity - delay maps are given in table [ table : memecho ] .",
    "we also show more detailed velocity - delay maps for each individual emission line recovered for each object in figures [ fig : mrk335fancy]-[fig : pg2130fancy ] . to aid the eye in comparing ionization - stratified blr structure between different emission lines in each object , we also provide false - color maps in figure [ fig : colorplots ] , with each color representing a different emission line as described in the captions .",
    "we also created simulated velocity - delay maps for a few different blr kinematic models to compare qualitatively with our recovered velocity - delay maps .",
    "these simulated maps are shown in figure [ fig : toys ] , and represent different blr models around a black hole with @xmath39  = @xmath40 _ m@xmath41 .",
    "we see features reminiscent of these simple models in our recovered velocity - delay maps .",
    "the velocity - binned analysis of mrk 335 shows a definite velocity - dependent lag signature ( figure [ fig : velres ] ) , and we clearly see similar structures in the velocity - delay maps of both the heii  and h@xmath0  emission lines ( figure  [ fig : mrk335fancy ] ) .",
    "we see a chevron - shaped pattern in the heii  line , with a lack of prompt response in the center and shorter delays in the wings , which is consistent with the signatures expected from an inclined disk or a spherical shell ( figure [ fig : toys ] ) . in the h@xmath0  emission , we see an asymmetric profile , with longer lags towards the blue end of the emission , and shorter lags towards the red end .",
    "this is suggestive of inflowing gas , as demonstrated in our simple infall models given in figure [ fig : toys ] .",
    "this also matches the signature we found in our initial velocity - binned analysis .",
    "the heii  emission is confined to smaller delays , as is expected from photoionization models of the blr .",
    "also consistent with disk structure is the response of heiialong a much wider velocity range than that of h@xmath0 .",
    "fewer kinematic details are apparent in the recovered maps for mrk 1501 than for the other objects in our sample .",
    "this may be a consequence of the noisier continuum and emission - line light curves obtained for this target .",
    "nonetheless , we can still gain useful insights into the h@xmath0  and h@xmath11-emitting regions of the blr in this object . as with mrk 335",
    ", we see evidence in the velocity - delay maps for inflow , with longer lags in the blue and shorter lags towards the red end of the h@xmath0  and h@xmath11  emission lines .",
    "this signature is closest to that of the `` extended blr '' infall model shown in figure [ fig : toys ] .",
    "while this velocity - delay map is probably too low - resolution for any detailed modeling , we do see this same signature in our velocity - resolved analysis in figure  [ fig : velres ] .",
    "there is also evidence for radial stratification of the blr  figure  [ fig : colorplots ] shows there is a much stronger h@xmath0  response at longer time lags than is observed for the h@xmath11  emission .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that photoionization physics regulates the size of the blr , as h@xmath11  is a higher - energy transition and would therefore need to be located closer to the ionizing source than h@xmath0 .",
    "our velocity - delay maps for 3c120 , shown in full in figure  [ fig : veldelay ] , are the cleanest maps we were able to recover .",
    "we see evidence for radial stratification , with heiishowing the shortest delays and h@xmath11  and h@xmath0  emitted at progressively larger radii .",
    "figure  [ fig : colorplots ] shows all three emission lines on one scale , with h@xmath0 , h@xmath11 , and heiishown in red , blue , and green , respectively , highlighting the radial stratification . the lack of a prompt response at line center in both balmer lines indicates a deficit of material along the line of sight .",
    "the shape of the hydrogen response is consistent with signatures expected from an inclined disk or a spherical shell ( figure [ fig : toys ] ) .",
    "this is similar to the signal found in ngc5548 ( @xcite ) , arp 151 ( @xcite ) , and mrk 50 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also see an asymmetry in the strength of the response in both the heii  and h@xmath0  emission profiles , nominally indicating inflow .",
    "the smaller velocity range of the h@xmath0  and h@xmath11  emission with respect to heii , combined with the radial stratification signatures , is consistent with disk structure .",
    "the velocity - delay map for pg2130 + 099 is somewhat noisier than that of 3c120 , and the model fits are not as good .",
    "however , the structure of the map is worth noting . while reverberation delays for the heiiemission remain unresolved for this data , both the h@xmath0  and h@xmath11  emission lines clearly show velocity - resolved delay structure , with strong asymmetries as a function of velocity across the emission - line profile",
    "this is similar to the h@xmath0  emission we see in mrk 335 and the heii  emission in 3c120 .",
    "this asymmetry , with longer lags at the blue end of the emission line and shorter lags to the red , is suggestive of inflowing gas , and matches the `` infall ( less - extended blr ) '' model in figure [ fig : toys ] quite well . in our analysis of the velocity - binned sections of the h@xmath0  emission line ( figure [ fig : velres ] )",
    ", we see this same structure , so while the delay maps for this object are probably not good enough for any detailed modeling , they are consistent with the signatures of inflowing material already seen in this object .",
    "pg2130 + 099 has long been a curiosity .",
    "early on , @xcite measured a time lag of @xmath42180 days in this object , placing it well above the @xmath43@xmath44  relationship .",
    "later studies by @xcite and @xcite found much shorter lags on the order of tens of days : most recently , @xcite reported a mean h@xmath0  time delay of 12.8@xmath45 days .",
    "these studies attributed the discrepancies to undersampled light curves combined with long - term secular changes in the h@xmath0  equivalent width in the data from @xcite . however , even with the new , shorter lag measurements , pg2130 + 099 is still a major outlier from the @xmath43@xmath44  relation , as it is now positioned far below the relation ( @xcite ) . despite the higher sampling rate of the more recent campaigns ,",
    "ambiguities remain as to whether the measured h@xmath0  lags represent the true mean blr radius , as the light curves were missing data at key points in time .",
    "we see in our velocity - delay map that the majority of the response in the h@xmath0  emission seems to be centered on a delay of @xmath4230 days ( figures [ fig : pg2130fancy ] and [ fig : colorplots ] ) .",
    "to investigate this , we ran a one - dimensional delay map analysis of pg2130 + 099 in memecho to look for an indication of where the true lag lies .",
    "figure [ fig : onedpg2130 ] shows the model continuum light curve envelope in the bottom panel , and the h@xmath0  light curve from @xcite in the top right panel ; the top left panel shows the delay map recovered by memecho .",
    "the memecho model fits the data fairly well in this case , and there are two clear peaks in the delay map .",
    "the stronger peak is centered around 12.5 days , and the slightly weaker peak is centered at 31 days .",
    "we compare this with the two - dimensional velocity - delay map ( figures [ fig : veldelay ] , [ fig : pg2130fancy ] , and [ fig : colorplots ] ) , which shows a large signal on the blue side of the emission concentrated at around 30 days and a fainter signal to the redward side that stretches down to shorter lags .",
    "a plausible model reproducing these results is a nearly face - on disk with the emitting gas located at around 30 light - days , combined with a strong inflowing gas component not necessarily within the plane of the disk .",
    "including an inflow signature when we measure the flux of the entire h@xmath0  emission line could cause our result to be skewed towards shorter mean lags , when the true distance of the virialized gas is closer to @xmath4230 days .",
    "because of the lower quality and coarser sampling of the light curves for this object , we will likely be unable to model this structure in much more detail .",
    "however , it is clear from the delay map that the majority of the h@xmath0  signal comes from a radius of @xmath4231 light - days .",
    "this radius puts pg2130 + 099 much closer to the @xmath43@xmath44  relation .",
    "this also increases the black hole mass estimate for pg2130 + 099 by a factor of about 2.4 , putting it at about 10@xmath46 _ m@xmath41 .",
    "this would place pg2130 + 099 definitely within the expected scatter of the @xmath39@xmath47  relation .",
    "memecho gives the user control over various aspects of the fitting process .",
    "we first consider the weights @xmath29 ( see equation [ eq : entropy ] ) , which are implemented in memecho as the user - controlled @xmath36 and @xmath37 parameters . the @xmath36 parameter controls the weight given to pixels in @xmath25 relative to the weight given to the pixels in the continuum model @xmath24 .",
    "increasing @xmath36 makes the delay map stiffer and allows for more flexibility in the continuum model .",
    "@xmath37 affects the aspect ratio of features in the velocity - delay map @xmath25 .",
    "the default values for @xmath25 are geometric means of neighboring pixels , with @xmath37 increasing the weight of neighbor pixels in the @xmath48 direction relative to those in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "it is important that the structures we see in our delay maps are not dependent on our choices of @xmath37 and @xmath36 . to verify that our results are robust , we produced memecho models altering the @xmath37 and @xmath36 parameters and changing the wavelength and velocity grids of the transfer function models .",
    "the panels of figure [ fig : awmosaic ] show the resulting velocity - delay maps for 3c120 as we vary these parameters .",
    "for the most part , the general shape of our velocity - delay map is not affected by changes in @xmath37 or @xmath36 . however ,",
    "if @xmath37 is made too large , we start to over - fit the data and introduce spurious features into the maps .",
    "the stability with respect to the @xmath36 parameter is expected , since the continuum light curve we are using is very highly sampled , and therefore very highly constrained .",
    "since these behaviors are generic to all four objects , we only show the results for 3c120 .",
    "we also investigated the effect of varying the target @xmath22 of the memecho solution , as the final resolution of the recovered delay maps is controlled by this parameter .",
    "the choice of the target @xmath22 is a trade off between smoother , lower delay resolution maps for higher @xmath22 , and sharper but less reliable structure in the maps at lower @xmath22 . because we are using over - sampled continuum model light curves from javelin ,",
    "the actual value of @xmath22 is no longer strictly valid , because the continuum light curve data points are not fully independent .",
    "therefore , our chosen values of @xmath22 reflect the best trade - off between delay - map resolution and reliable structure in the fits that we could obtain .",
    "figure [ fig : ctmosaic ] shows velocity - delay maps for 3c120 as we vary the @xmath22 , from left to right . as we lower the target @xmath22 , the structure eventually becomes more complex but also less reliable , as the fits are now producing structures to model the noise in the line light curves .",
    "however , the basic structure of the velocity - delay maps is robust to reasonable changes in the target @xmath22 .",
    "when we vary the minimum lag @xmath49 that we allow memecho to consider , we also see a trend worth noting .",
    "figure [ fig : ctmosaic ] shows that when @xmath49 is set to zero ( top panels ) , the velocity - delay structure in the map also extends all the way to zero .",
    "however , when negative lags are allowed ( middle and bottom panels ) , we see that the structure in the velocity - delay maps , particularly when considering the chevron - shaped structure in the h@xmath0  and h@xmath11  emission lines , peaks at a positive delay and is lower at @xmath50 but does not extend to 0 .",
    "this has to do with the way memecho deals with its delay map models .",
    "the default is set to `` pull '' the response down to zero at the ends of the delay map when @xmath49 and @xmath51 are not equal to zero .",
    "therefore , when @xmath52 , the default can not pull down at the low-@xmath5 end , so the lowest - entropy map is an exponential function of @xmath5 . with @xmath53 ,",
    "the entropy pulls down on both ends of the delay map , which then creates a gaussian peak at positive delays .",
    "because of this , different values of @xmath49 can affect the final velocity - delay maps produced , as this effectively regulates the behavior of the model on some level when trying to smooth the delay maps to the default image .",
    "we currently have no means to evaluate which value of @xmath49 results in the `` correct '' velocity - delay map  it is therefore worth considering velocity - delay maps with various @xmath49 parameters , as we do here , when drawing conclusions about the blr structure signatures , and any detailed modeling and interpretations should consider and evaluate the differences in these maps . in this work ,",
    "we make only qualitative statements regarding the signatures seen in the velocity - delay maps . whether or not the response actually reaches zero at any point in the 3c120 maps is unknown , but for our purposes it is reassuring that all of the maps show the same basic structures and kinematic signatures . from figure",
    "[ fig : ctmosaic ] , comparing results for @xmath54 and 0 , we can also evaluate the evidence for a deficit of prompt response from the resulting delay maps created with each value of @xmath49 .",
    "at all three values of @xmath55 , we see gaussian delay distributions at positive lags in the core of h@xmath0  and h@xmath11  in 3c120 , but not for heii   thus the data provide evidence for a deficit of prompt response in the center of h@xmath0  and h@xmath11 , but not for heii .",
    "this behavior is consistent with our expectations for the stratification of the blr .",
    "we have presented velocity - delay maps constructed from the line and continuum variations observed in four objects from our 2010 reverberation campaign .",
    "these maps provide new insights into the structure of the blr and constitute a dramatic increase in the number of objects that have at least some information on the velocity field of the blr .",
    "along with the velocity - delay maps for arp 151 ( @xcite ) and the models of mrk 50 ( @xcite ) , these velocity - delay maps provide the strongest constraints on the structure of the blr .",
    "our velocity - delay map for 3c120 shows very similar structure to the map of arp 151 , which also shows a lack of prompt response in the balmer lines .",
    "the continuum light curves for arp 151 were well - enough sampled that @xcite were able to recover a velocity - delay map using the original continuum light curve instead of substituting in simulated ones .",
    "the similarities between the maps for arp 151 and our maps lends weight to the reliability of our results using the simulated continuum light curves .",
    "we also see very asymmetric profiles in both the balmer and high - ionization emission that is suggestive of infalling gas in all of our objects . in 3c120 and",
    "mrk 335 , the transfer function structure for the balmer lines differs from that for the ii4686 heii@xmath1  emission line , suggesting different structures dominating at different blr radii . in all cases where our data are of sufficient quality to constrain the structure of the blr",
    ", we see clear evidence of infall and rotation , both of which result from the gravitational influence of the black hole .",
    "as gravitationally dominated motion is the key assumption of reverberation mapping , our results strongly support the reliability of black hole mass estimates derived from reverberation mapping .",
    "detailed modeling of our most well - defined velocity - delay maps and a complete discussion of the implications will follow in a future work .",
