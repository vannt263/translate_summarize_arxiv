    "the hermes experiment@xcite is a study of the spin structure of the nucleon which emphasizes on an unambiguous measurement of pion , kaon , and proton semi - inclusive spin asymmetries in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) . these asymmetries provide information on the flavor dependence of polarized structure functions and the sea polarization . however , most of the hadrons produced in hermes  @xcite lie between 2  and 10  gev , a region in which it has not been feasible to separate pions , kaons , and protons with standard particle identification ( pid ) techniques . ring imaging erenkov ( rich ) and threshold erenkov systems using heavy gases  @xcite , such as @xmath2 , at atmospheric pressure are useful only for energies above 10  gev since the kaon threshold for erenkov radiation is typically higher than 9  gev .",
    "because of substantial multiple scattering and brems - strahlung , the use of a high pressure gas system is not technically feasible in hermes .",
    "clear liquid radiators are only useful for hadron identification below roughly 2  gev because of their very low erenkov light thresholds and large chromatic dispersion .    with the recent development@xcite of new clear silica aerogel with a low index of refraction , this difficult energy region can now be spanned .",
    "aerogels have long been used in threshold erenkov counters  @xcite , but their use as a radiator in a rich system is a recent development  @xcite which has resulted from the availability of material with excellent optical properties .",
    "this paper reports the successful use , for the first time , of clear aerogel in combination with a heavy gas , @xmath2 , in a rich detector .",
    "this dual - radiator rich detector provides clean separation of pions , kaons , and protons over most of the kinematic acceptance of the hermes experiment .",
    "such a configuration was first proposed for the plannedlhcb experiment  @xcite .",
    "the following section  2 describes the general design of the hermes rich detector and the properties of its key components .",
    "section  3 describes briefly the online monitoring of the system , section  4 the reconstruction and particle identification and section  5 the necessary software correction of the mirror alignment .",
    "section  6 finally is dedicated to the performance of the detector .",
    "hermes is located in the east hall of the hera storage ring complex .",
    "the spectrometer is split into two halves above and below a central horizontal magnetic shielding plate through which the hera beams pass  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the rich detector also consists of two symmetric rich modules , the top and the bottom rich sections .",
    "the rich is positioned between the two rear tracking chambers , so that the free space is only 1.25  m deep .",
    "the outer body and the gas control system were taken unchanged from the previous threshold erenkov counters .",
    "figure  [ fig : hadron_momenta ] shows the hadron momentum spectra in the hermes acceptance obtained from a geant based monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the deep inelastic scattering of 27.5 gev positrons off a hydrogen target .",
    "the fall - off of the spectra at low momenta is due to the field of the spectrometer magnet , which severely limits the acceptance at lower momenta . about 95% of all hadrons in the acceptance",
    "are found in the range of 2.0 to 15.0 gev .",
    "this defines the momentum range over which clear particle identification should be provided .",
    "= 3.0 in    the low end of this range determines the index of refraction necessary for the aerogel .",
    "a value of n(@xmath3=633  nm)=1.03 was chosen since it leads to a kaon threshold of 2 gev .",
    "the erenkov angles produced by the combination of this aerogel and the heavy gas ( @xmath2 ) for pions , kaons and protons are plotted in figure  [ cerangles ] as a function of particle momentum .",
    "the corresponding threshold momenta are listed in table  [ table : thresholds ] .",
    "all pion momenta within the spectrometer acceptance are above the pion threshold momentum for aerogel of 0.6  gev , 90% of the kaon and 78% of the proton momenta are above the kaon threshold of 2.0  gev .    = 3.in    .erenkov light thresholds for pions , kaons and protons .",
    "the index of refraction n is given at 633 nm , @xmath4 is the threshold velocity and @xmath5 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is not possible to use another detector to create clean hadron samples to study the detector performance .",
    "however , it is possible to use decaying particles for the same purpose .",
    "samples of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons as well as @xmath9 hyperons were used to determine the identification efficiencies for pions , kaons and protons .",
    "the momentum integrated results ( p@xmath102  gev ) are shown in table  [ table : decays ] .",
    "the mc values in table  [ table : efficiencies ] and the experimental values in table  [ table : decays ] can not be compared directly , because the efficiencies depend strongly on the particle momentum as well as on the event topology .",
    "this dependence on the event topology can be excluded by comparing subsamples with only one track per detector half .",
    "figure  [ ppi ] compares mc and experimental data for the case of single track pions .",
    "the four plots show the identification probabilities @xmath11 that a pion is identified as pion , kaon , proton or not identified ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the pion identification efficiency @xmath13 for single tracks is above 92% even at low momenta , and above 98% for momenta larger than 4 gev .",
    "the mc data are taken from the sample also used for table  [ table : efficiencies ] , while the experimental data are from @xmath14-decays .",
    "mc and experimental results agree well , with the possible exception of the lowest moment bin .",
    "the comparison of mc and experimental data becomes more involved for event topologies with overlapping rings and as the opening angle for @xmath7-decays in hermes is small there are basically no experimental data with one single kaon per detector half .",
    "a detailed evaluation of the detector performance that takes the event topology and momentum dependence into account in detail will be included in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the hermes rich detector has been constructed and installed within 13 months after its approval .",
    "it has been operating routinely as part of the hermes experiment since its installation in may 1998 .",
    "its operation has been stable and reliable for more than two years .",
    "the single photon resolution for ideal tracks is close to the mc predictions .",
    "the particle identification based on the inverse ray tracing technique has been implemented and its likelihood analysis has been optimized .",
    "more elaborate particle identification schemes are under development .",
    "hadron identification by the rich detector will be a crucial feature of the analysis of the current ( 1998 - 2000 ) and future hermes data .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the desy management for its support and the desy staff and the staffs of the collaborating institutions for their strong and enthusiastic support . it is a pleasure to acknowledge the assistance of r. romeo of composite mirror applications in the installation and initial alignment of the mirror array , and valuable consultations with the selex group at fnal during the design of the hermes rich .",
