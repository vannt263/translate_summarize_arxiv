    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss the evolution of the structure of a single polymer molecule after the environment has been changed from a good solvent to a poor solvent .",
    "our approach is via a phenomenological model for the kinetics of the early stages of collapse .",
    "we have in mind a long flexible polymer chain immersed in a simple solvent , and a change in the temperature @xmath5 as the means of altering the solvent quality .",
    "the initial state is one of equilibrium in a good solvent , in which the chain is swollen and has radius of gyration @xmath6 , where @xmath4 is the degree of polymerization .",
    "the final state is one of equilibrium in a poor solvent , in which the chain is collapsed into a dense , spherical globule , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "the variation of the equilibrium state with the solvent quality is , with some important caveats , well understood  @xcite . in marked contrast",
    ", there is no comparable consensus concerning the kinetics of collapse following an abrupt @xmath5 quench , i.e. , a rapid change in temperature from above to below the @xmath8 temperature .",
    "the experimental picture is not clear because of difficulties due to the competition between the collapse of the individual chains and the aggregation of different ones . as a result",
    ", there have been only few experimental studies of the kinetics of collapse of isolated chains  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have utilized a variety of approaches in focusing on different aspects of the problem .",
    "langevin models  @xcite , phenomenological models  @xcite and computer simulations  @xcite have been used to consider the kinetics of collapse in the absence of topological constraints .",
    "other studies have focused on the role of internal entanglements  @xcite or the competition with chain - chain aggregation  @xcite . in spite of",
    "the extensive activity is this area , a complete picture of the kinetics of collapse has yet to emerge .",
    "the search for such picture is motivated primarily by the intense current interest in the protein folding question  @xcite because early stages of protein folding are thought to proceed as the collapse of flexible homopolymers .",
    "the collapse of a flexible chain following an abrupt change of solvent quality displays certain features of a first - order phase transition .",
    "these features occur for chains of finite @xmath4 for which the surface free energy of the globule plays an important role .",
    "two such features are important to the present discussion .",
    "first , the onset of collapse involves , as we shall discuss , the formation of droplets of the dense `` phase '' .",
    "second , the collapse proceeds via intermediate states corresponding to the `` tadpole '' configuration of a stretched , collapsed globule  @xcite , which involve the coexistence of dense globules and strongly stretched segments . with this picture in mind , it is possible to distinguish between four stages in the kinetics of collapse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figone ] ) .",
    "each stage is characterized by a length - scale and a time - scale .",
    "the characteristic time scale increases with the relevant length scale .",
    "the formation of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) droplets of the dense phase , which we refer to as `` pearls '' , is the fastest process .",
    "this `` pearling '' stage involves local rearrangement of the chain configurations within the randomly placed droplets during which the dimensions and configurations of the chain as a whole are only weakly modified . the    = 3.5 in    0.5truecm",
    "nascent droplets then grow by accreting monomers from the bridges that connect them .",
    "the positions of the growing droplets are roughly stationary and their growth is accommodated by the gradual stretching of the bridges .",
    "this `` bridge - stretching '' stage ends when the tension in the bridges attains the equilibrium value @xmath11 corresponding to the `` tadpole '' configuration of a stretched globule . during this process",
    "the dimensions of the chain as a whole remain essentially constant _",
    "i.e , _ @xmath12 but the configurations of the bridges are qualitatively modified .",
    "the number of droplets @xmath9 is set by the requirement that @xmath13 at the end of this stage , thus leading to @xmath14 .",
    "beyond this point , the growth of the `` pearls '' is accompanied by shortening of the bridges and the overall shrinking of the chain .",
    "the third stage , the collapse of the `` pearl necklace '' , involves the chain as a whole .",
    "the corresponding length scale @xmath15 is larger and the characteristic time is thus longer .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath9 remains roughly constant during these three stages .",
    "eventually , the droplets come into contact , and coalesce into a single globule .",
    "our discussion is limited to the early stages of the collapse .",
    "the last regime will not be considered in the present paper . within this picture , the characteristic times for the first three stages , pearling , bridge - stretching and the collapse of the pearl necklace are , respectively , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the model we propose differs from the existing phenomenological descriptions in two respects .",
    "first , the two initial stages were not considered in these models .",
    "second , the treatment of the third stage , the collapse of the pearl necklace , is different .",
    "a more detailed comparison with the phenomenological models , as well as the langevin - type theories and to simulation studies , will be presented in the final section .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . to obtain the temporal evolution of the various stages we balance the driving force with the entropy production .",
    "a discussion of this approach is presented in section ii . in section",
    "iii we recall some key results concerning collapse blobs and the thermodynamics of collapse . in addition , we discuss the initial role of the collapse blobs as spinodal `` modes '' and the equilibrium deformation behavior of a collapsed chain .",
    "the collapse of a chain from a good solvent to a @xmath8 solvent is discussed in section iv .",
    "the results are then used to analyze the first stage of the collapse , i.e. , the formation of nascent droplets or `` pearling '' . in section",
    "v we discuss the collapse of a chain with constrained ends .",
    "this discussion is then utilized to describe the second stage of collapse , in which the stationary droplets , pearls , grow by accreting monomers from the bridges thus causing the bridges to stretch .",
    "the shrinking of the resulting string of pearls is analyzed in section vi .",
    "the design of the phenomenological model presented in this paper , involves two steps . in the first step we propose a sequence of stages followed by the collapsing chain ( the stages involved were outlined in the introduction . )",
    "the second step is to calculate the characteristic time associated with the various stages in the proposed route .",
    "a simple method for calculating the characteristic times was proposed by de gennes  @xcite .",
    "it focuses on a volume element of solvent containing a single chain and coupled to a thermal reservoir that maintains a temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the systems as a whole , is closed . during collapse ,",
    "the free energy of the chain @xmath19 decreases .",
    "the decrease in @xmath19 gives rise to an increase in @xmath20 the total entropy of the system as a whole .",
    "since the collapse is the only irreversible process involved the changes in @xmath19 and @xmath20 are related by @xmath21 the dynamics of the process are described by @xmath22 to implement this argument , it is necessary to specify : ( i ) @xmath19 as a function of the chain radius @xmath23 .",
    "one assumes that @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the form of @xmath19 for the various stages will be discussed at the appropriate sections .",
    "one must also specify ( ii ) the operative dissipation mechanisms that determine @xmath27 in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath28 .",
    "this entropy production approach is independent of the model , in that its applicability is not limited to a specific choice of @xmath29 or of the dissipative modes . nor",
    "does it provide guidance for choosing this crucial input .",
    "two dissipation mechanisms are considered for the various stages of collapse .",
    "first is the viscous dissipation associated with the motion of the solvent .",
    "second is the frictional dissipation due to the stokes drag on the chain .",
    "the magnitude of the viscous force  @xcite acting on a unit volume is on the order of @xmath30where @xmath31 is the shear viscosity . in the following we",
    "estimate it by @xmath32  the associated dissipation per unit time is thus roughly @xmath33 and the total hydrodynamic dissipation within a volume @xmath34 is @xmath35 as given by @xmath36 the stokes drag force acting on a sphere of radius @xmath37 moving with a constant velocity @xmath28 is @xmath38  and the associated `` frictional '' dissipation per particle is @xmath39 to obtain the total frictional dissipation it is necessary to sum the contributions due to the hydrodynamically impenetrable objects involved in the stage considered . the number of such objects , their radius @xmath37 and the relationship between @xmath37 and @xmath23 differ in the various stages of collapse .",
    "the de gennes argument is equivalent to equating the frictional force to the contraction force .",
    "it allows us however , to consider on equal footing the dissipation due to stokes drag forces and to the hydrodynamic flows . finally , note that the dissipation increases with the length scale",
    "this observation motivates the proposed sequence of stages which involve processes taking place at progressively larger length scales .",
    "the familiar methods of irreversible thermodynamics  @xcite focus on linear responses , the onsager relations , and their refinements .",
    "in marked difference , the de  gennes approach is not limited to a linear regime nor does it relay on the analysis of the regression of fluctuations .",
    "the method applies to the complete dynamic range , provided that the driving forces and the dissipation mechanisms are correctly identified .",
    "the dissipative modes invoked in our discussion hold under the assumption that the hydrodynamic description is applicable to the collapse of a polymer .",
    "it is expedient to use this approach , but one should note that the validity of continuum theories at this length scale is a delicate issue .",
    "whilst the configurations of polymers in good and poor solvents are well understood , the nature of the transition between the two regimes is not fully resolved .",
    "different models suggest that the transition may be continuous or discontinuous , depending on @xmath4 and the stiffness of the chain .",
    "the issue of the order of the transition is , however , irrelevant when considering a collapse following a quench to the poor solvent regime . in this regime ,",
    "the equilibrium configuration of the chain is determined primarily by the flory interaction free energy @xmath40 .",
    "the elasticity of the chain , i.e. , its configurational entropy , plays a relatively minor role , limited to determining the structure of the globule - solvent interface  @xcite . in the case of a single chain ,",
    "for which the translational entropy of the polymer is irrelevant , the @xmath41 limit of @xmath42 determines the equilibrium behavior : @xmath43 here , @xmath44 is the monomer volume - fraction and @xmath45 , the flory parameter , is a measure of the strength of the interactions giving rise to the mixing enthalpy . for a given polymer - solvent system , @xmath45 depends only on the temperature @xmath46 in the good solvent regime , for which @xmath47 @xmath40 is a convex function of @xmath44 .",
    "a critical point occurs at @xmath48 @xmath49 specified by @xmath50 and @xmath51 when @xmath52 the solvent is poor and the plot is concave in the range @xmath53 a common tangent construction between the origin and @xmath54 indicates the coexistence of a dense phase , of concentration @xmath54 and the neat solvent .",
    "the @xmath55 phase corresponds to the collapsed globule .",
    "this amounts to setting the osmotic pressure of the polymer @xmath56 within the dense phase to zero , as is expected because there are no free polymers in the solvent .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath56 leads to @xmath57 .  in the vicinity of the @xmath8 temperature",
    ", the @xmath58 term may be approximated by the first three terms of its taylor expansion .",
    "the @xmath59 requirement then leads to @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the second virial coefficient , @xmath62 is the size of the monomer , and @xmath63 is the third virial coefficient .",
    "thus , @xmath54 is determined by the balance of attractive binary monomer - monomer interactions and higher - order repulsive interactions .",
    "the chain elasticity does not play a role . in turn",
    ", @xmath55 sets the radius of the collapsed globule via @xmath64 leading to @xmath65 the occurrence of an unstable region in @xmath66 is a crucial feature of this discussion . due to this feature ,",
    "the collapse of a quenched chain exhibits certain characteristics of first - order phase transition .",
    "the structure of the interface , and the corresponding surface tension , can not be obtained from the discussion presented above . a `` blobological '' argument",
    "can provide the missing information  @xcite .",
    "the configurations of a collapsed chain are characterized by a correlation length , @xmath67  on length scales smaller than @xmath68 the monomer - monomer attraction is too weak to perturb the configurations of the chain , and it behaves as a random walk .",
    "this allows one to define collapse blobs , which comprise @xmath69 monomers such that @xmath70 a fully collapsed chain can be envisioned as a spherical globule composed of close - packed @xmath71-blobs .",
    "the correlation length @xmath68 is determined by equating the interaction free - energy due to monomer - monomer attraction in such a chain segment to @xmath72 the interaction free - energy is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the second virial coefficient . in the vicinity of the @xmath8 temperature , @xmath74 may be expressed as @xmath75 where @xmath76 thus leading to @xmath77 the density @xmath78 within a single blob is comparable to that of the dense phase @xmath55 resulting from the  phase separation of free polymers in a poor solvent .",
    "the @xmath68-blobs attract each other , and the unperturbed chain forms a collapsed globule of radius @xmath79 a collapse blob in contact with the solvent is assigned an energy of @xmath72 thus , the boundary of the globule is associated with a surface free energy @xmath80 note that the blob picture , as described above , is valid only when the chain comprises many collapse blobs , i.e. , when the depth of the quench is such that @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we should also add that in the following we treat the @xmath68-blobs as hydrodynamically impenetrable spheres .",
    "when @xmath4 is sufficiently large , the collapsed globule may be viewed as a droplet of the dense phase with density @xmath55 in coexistence with the neat solvent . within our model ,",
    "the first stage of collapse involves @xmath83 droplets , pearls , that are joined by bridges which retain the configurations found in good solvent conditions .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the condensation of a fluid droplets from a supersaturated vapor  @xcite . in this last situation",
    "it is found that droplets whose radius is smaller than a critical radius @xmath84 tend to evaporate whereas larger drops , i.e. , those for which @xmath85 grow indefinitely .",
    "this similarity wrongly suggests that the formation of nascent pearls is analogous to the nucleation of critical droplets .",
    "this analogy is discredited by the following rough argument .",
    "the thermodynamic potential of a dense droplet coexisting with `` free '' monomers is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the number of monomers in the droplet , and @xmath88 is the chemical potential of the free monomers . for a sufficiently large droplet @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the chemical potential of a monomer within the droplet . choosing the reference state to be a blob within the droplet and assigning @xmath91 to an `` uncondensed '' blob , leads to @xmath92 which has a maximum at @xmath93 as eq .",
    "( [ iii6 ] ) is only valid for @xmath87 @xmath94 this establishes only that there is no critical droplet of larger size .",
    "this argument does however suggest that chain segments incorporating @xmath95 monomers play a special role in the onset of collapse .",
    "this view is consistent with the definition of a @xmath71-blob : the monomer - monomer attraction is too weak to perturb the chain configurations on smaller length scales , but is sufficient to induce collapse on length scales larger than @xmath96 it is also helpful to note that the shrinkage of a chain segment into a collapse blob does not encounter a free - energy barrier .",
    "accordingly , a collapse blob can not be viewed as a critical droplet .",
    "rather , the formation of a @xmath68-blob resembles spinodal decomposition with the caveat that the associated dissipation arises from configurational changes of the chain as a whole .",
    "thus , in order to minimize the entropy production the first step of the collapse involves the formation of a small number @xmath9 ( @xmath97 ) of collapse blobs instead of a string of @xmath98 @xmath68-blobs    the concave region in @xmath40 is also the origin of the force - law governing the extension a collapsed globule . when the end - to - end distance of the stretched globule is fixed , a dense globule coexists with a stretched string of @xmath68-blobs .",
    "the tension @xmath11 associated with this coexistence is the driving force for the third stage of the collapse .",
    "the extension of the globule actually involves three regimes  @xcite . in the first regime the spherical form of the globule is initially deformed into a prolate ellipsoid , but maintains a constant volume corresponding to close packing of the @xmath68-blobs . within this linear - response regime",
    "the free - energy penalty @xmath99 incurred is due to the increase of the surface free energy @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the surface area increment associated with the deformation , and @xmath102 is the length of the axis of rotation .",
    "the corresponding restoring force , @xmath103 , is proportional to the strain @xmath104@xmath105 this type of process can not proceed indefinitely .",
    "if it were pursued indefinitely , the distorted globule will assume a cylindrical shape and , eventually , form a string of @xmath68-blobs .",
    "this scenario gives rise to a van der waals loop in the @xmath106 _ vs. _ @xmath23 diagram .",
    "in turn , this is indicative of instability with respect to a coexistence of a weakly elongated globule and a stretched string of @xmath68-blobs .",
    "this effect is reminiscent of the rayleigh - plateau instability  @xcite involving the break - up of a fluid jet into a succession of droplets . in the second ,",
    "coexistence , regime the chain comprises a stretched string of @xmath107 @xmath71-blobs and a roughly spherical globule of @xmath108 closely packed @xmath109-blobs . to characterize this equilibrium situation",
    "it is necessary to minimized the free energy of a stretched chain comprised of a dense globule and a string of @xmath107 collapse blobs , i.e. , @xmath110 the first term allows for the transfer of the collapse blobs from the solvent into the ",
    "dense phase ,  i.e. , the interior of the globule .",
    "this is the primary driving term for the growth of the globule .",
    "the second term reflects the surface free energy of the globule .",
    "the elastic free energy of the string of blobs is described by the third term .",

    "the third term is the stretching energy of the extended string of length @xmath120 as given by the gaussian expression for the elastic penalty @xmath121 it is also possible to interpret this last term as the surface energy of the extended string .",
    "the end - to - end distance reflects two contributions @xmath122 .",

    "when @xmath123 is sufficiently large we may approximate @xmath124 as @xmath125 and the corresponding force law @xmath126 reads @xmath127 it is important to note that @xmath106 decreases as @xmath128 approaches @xmath71 .",
    "this finite - size correction is reminiscent of the laplace law for the vapor pressure of small droplets .",
    "it is negligible over a wide range of extensions if @xmath4 is large enough .",
    "because of this correction different deformation scenarios are expected for the @xmath129 and the @xmath130 ensembles . in the first case the globule unravels completely as soon as a critical force @xmath131 is applied .",
    "no globule - coil coexistence is expected .",
    "such a coexistence is however expected when an end - to - end distance is imposed . in this case",
    "the tension in the string is @xmath11 .",
    "the onset of the coexistence occurs when @xmath132 as can be seen by equating @xmath133 to the force given by eq .",
    "( [ iii8 ] ) .",
    "the upper boundary of this second regime corresponds to a fully extended string of blobs , @xmath134 stronger extension is characterized by simple gaussian elasticity , up to the onset of finite extensibility effects .",
    "a quench from @xmath136 to @xmath137 causes the chain to shrink from @xmath138 to @xmath139 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : figtwo ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of this process are of interest for two reasons .",
    "first , as we shall discuss , the formation of nascent pearls follows similar kinetics .",
    "second , the discussion of this process is especially simple , thus providing a useful introduction to the subsequent sections .",
    "the quench to @xmath137 turns off the repulsive interactions between the monomers so that driving force for the  collapse to @xmath140 is due  solely to the gaussian elastic free energy of the chain , @xmath141 or @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 is the instantaneous chain radius at time @xmath145 . to obtain the characteristic time for this process we equate the time derivative of the elastic energy , @xmath146 to the dissipative losses associated with the shrinking , @xmath147 where @xmath27 is the corresponding entropy production .",
    "two dissipation processes are involved .",
    "one is the viscous dissipation due to the hydrodynamic flow resulting from the contraction of the coil . as was discussed previously ,",
    "the resulting entropy production within the coil is roughly @xmath148 where @xmath26 is the velocity of the flow .",
    "second is the entropy production due to the stokes drag force experienced by the monomers as they move through the solvent .",

    "@xmath151 leads to @xmath153 and the characteristic time associated with the hydrodynamic dissipation is thus the zimm time  @xcite of the ideal coil , i.e. , @xmath154 the frictional dissipation is dominant as it scales with @xmath4 rather than @xmath155 it leads to @xmath156 and the corresponding characteristic time is the rouse relaxation time@xcite of an ideal coil @xmath157 or @xmath158 as the rouse time is much longer , it dominates the process .    within our picture ,",
    "the first stage of the collapse is the formation of nascent pearls comprising each of roughly @xmath95 monomers .",
    "the process involves@xmath159",
    "randomly distributed chain segments .",
    "initially , each of the chain segments exhibits self - avoidance .",
    "once the solvent is quenched , the monomer - monomer repulsions disappear and the segments shrink to their ideal coil configuration . as the nascent pearls consist of only @xmath95 monomers the monomer - monomer attraction is not strong enough to perturb the ideal coil configuration within them .",
    "so long as @xmath9 is small enough , the overall radius of the chain is only weakly modified and the dissipation is due to the local configurational changes . in this picture it is possible to neglect the couplings between the droplets and between the droplets and the chain as whole .",
    "thus , the dynamics of this process are essentially identical to those of the collapse of a chain comprising @xmath95 monomers to @xmath8 conditions .",
    "the characteristic time is , accordingly the corresponding rouse time or @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the zimm time of a collapse blob .",
    "note that @xmath162 is independent of @xmath4 and @xmath9 as expected for a local process . a short relaxation time scaling as @xmath163",
    "is also predicted by langevin type theories of collapse  @xcite .",
    "in the second stage of the collapse , the roughly stationary droplets , `` pearls '' , grow by `` sucking in '' monomers from the bridges joining them .",
    "this stage ends when the initially undeformed bridges assume the configuration of a stretched string of @xmath68-blobs . in comparison to the `` spinodal '' stage described in section iv ,",
    "this process is distinguished by two features .",

    "second , the evolution of the droplets at this stage strongly affects the configuration of the bridges .",
    "the bridges stretch as the number of monomers in them decreases .",
    "we first consider the somewhat simpler situation of the collapse of a chain with its ends constrained to fixed positions separated by a distance @xmath164 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figthr ] ) .",
    "the free energy of such a chain , neglecting the surface free - energy , is given by @xmath165 where @xmath123 is the number of `` free '' monomers that have not been assimilated into a globule .",
    "we assume that the @xmath123 monomers behave as a random walk , i.e. , the instantaneous span of the chain perpendicular to the end - to - end vector is @xmath166 and as a result @xmath167    = 3.5 in    0.5truecm    relations  ( [ v2 ] ) and ( [ v3 ] ) are actually invalid at the initial stages of this regime , when the configurations of the chain still exhibit self - avoidance .",
    "they are , however , expected to apply at the final stages , which dominate the relaxation time . invoking them implies that the relaxation of the chain configuration when @xmath123 decreases is effectively instantaneous . the driving force for this stage , as specified by eqs .",

    "the span of an undeformed bridge with an ideal coil configuration is @xmath194 and the associated gaussian stretching penalty is @xmath195 assuming that the overall configuration is that of a random walk , @xmath196 the free energy of the chain as a whole is given by @xmath197 the equilibrium state of the chain , at a given instant , is specified by @xmath198 for constant @xmath23 and @xmath181 thus leading to @xmath199 we assumed that the decrease in @xmath23 is slow in comparison to the relaxation of @xmath123 for a given @xmath155 accordingly , the free energy for a certain @xmath200 as obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ vi1 ] ) and ( [ vi2 ] ) is given by @xmath201 and the corresponding force , @xmath202 is @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the equilibrium tension in the dumb - bell shaped , coexistence configuration .",
    "if the string of pearls is perfectly collinear , @xmath205 similar considerations lead to @xmath206 and @xmath207 . in this situation only the terminal pearls experience a net force . as the tension in the bridges , ignoring finite size effects , is @xmath208 the net force on the middle pearls is zero .",
    "however , if the pearls are the vertices of a random walk , each pearl is subject to a random force @xmath209 thus leading to ( [ vi4 ] ) .",
    "the thermodynamic driving force for the collapse is simply @xmath210 this reflects the rate of change in the number of `` free '' @xmath68-blobs , @xmath211 as before , two dissipation mechanisms are involved .",
    "the hydrodynamic dissipation is @xmath212 the dissipation modes in pearl necklace situation differs from the stretched - bridges case in two respects .",
    "first , @xmath213 replaces @xmath214 because the coil is assumed to shrink as a sphere .",
    "second , as the pearls are no longer stationary it is necessary to consider two dissipation modes associated with the stokes drag force .",
    "one is due , as before , to the contribution of the stretched bridges whereas the second arises from the motion of the hydrodynamically impenetrable pearls .",
    "the pearls term is @xmath215 where the volume of a pearl of closed packed @xmath68-blobs , @xmath216 specifies the radius of an individual pearl .",
    "the bridges term is , similarly , @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the length of an individual bridge .",
    "altogether , @xmath219 leads to @xmath220 dn ,   \\label{vi5}\\ ] ] where the three terms on the right hand side correspond , respectively , to the dissipation due to hydrodynamic flow , the pearls and the bridges . in this case",
    "it is simpler to solve individually each @xmath221 in order to find the characteristic time for the different dissipation modes and then to identify the dominant one .",
    "the hydrodynamic dissipation yields @xmath222 whereas the bridges contribution leads to @xmath223 and the pearls dissipation to @xmath224 estimating @xmath9 by @xmath225 yields @xmath226 @xmath227 and @xmath228 leading to the identification of @xmath229 as the longest relaxation time and the bridges dissipation as the rate - determining dissipation mode .",
    "note , however , that this is the case only for sufficiently deep quenches , when @xmath230 by contrast , hydrodynamic dissipation is dominant when @xmath231    the discussion presented above is based on three assumptions : ( i ) finite - size corrections are negligible and @xmath232 ( ii ) the pearls are placed at the vertices of a random walk ( iii ) @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "the first assumption is easiest to justify .",
    "the finite size correction to @xmath11 is @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the radius of the pearl .",
    "this correction is expected to be small at the end of the bridge - stretching stage . in any case , it decreases with time .",
    "the second assumption is reasonable , within our model , at the onset of the collapse of the pearl necklace .",
    "its range of validity is however uncertain .",
    "some simulation results support this picture  @xcite whilst others  @xcite suggest that the chain may approach a linear configuration .",
    "the assumption that @xmath233 is reasonable for @xmath237 both  @xcite and  @xcite support this view .",
    "the assumption of @xmath238  is clearly a rough approximation and @xmath9 is expected to decrease with time .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to note that both  @xcite and  @xcite suggest that @xmath9 varies very weakly over a wide range of times .",
    "`` pearl - pearl '' coalescence is the most likely mechanism for the decrease in @xmath239 initially , this is due to one - dimensional diffusion of the pearls that coalesce upon contact because of the surface free energy . at this point",
    "it is useful to consider two possible scenarios for the coalescence of the pearls . in the first , pearl diffusion",
    "is fast in comparison to the overall collapse of the chain . in this case",
    "the one dimensional diffusion incurs no free - energy penalties as long as @xmath123 is constant .",
    "the favored mode thus involves the transfer of monomers between two adjacent bridges and through the adjoining pearl .",
    "this transfer of monomers across the pearl must take place along the trajectory of the chain .",
    "it is , thus , a reptation type motion in the sense that the monomer needs to diffuse across a distance @xmath240 instead of @xmath241 this dissipation mode may well dominate over the stokes drag force . only the terminal pearls may diffuse in a non - reptative mode . in the other limit the pearl diffusion is relatively fast . in this case",
    "it can result from asymmetry in the rate of assimilating monomers from the two bridges .",
    "in this situation , the diffusion coefficient will reflect the stokes drag force on the pearls . in any case , the dynamics of diffusion - controlled coalescence in one - dimensional is complex .",
    "the case of the @xmath242 reaction , with constant diffusion coefficient @xmath243 was studied extensively  @xcite , and a rigorous solution was reported only recently  @xcite . at short times the linear concentration , @xmath244 follows the mean - field rate equation @xmath245 .",
    "however , the asymptotic solution at large times is @xmath246 instead of @xmath247 as predicted by the mean - field treatment .",
    "the situation encountered in the present case is more complicated in two respects : first , the diffusion coefficient is no longer a constant .",
    "rather , it depends on @xmath236 and thus on @xmath248  second , the total length varies with @xmath9 and @xmath236 thus introducing a novel mechanism for the @xmath145 dependence of @xmath249 a complete analysis of this problem is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "it is however possible to estimate a characteristic time , @xmath250 for the onset of coalescence .",
    "@xmath251 may be identified with the time required by a pearl in order to diffuse across a distance @xmath252 as specified by the einstein diffusion relation @xmath253 a lower bound for @xmath251 is obtained by assuming that the diffusion coefficient of the pearl scales as @xmath254 thus leading to @xmath255",
    "the literature concerning the theory of the dynamics of collapse describes three different approaches : langevin - type theories , simulation studies and phenomenological models .",
    "it is simplest to compare the present model to the earlier phenomenological models .",
    "the kinetics of collapse were first considered by de gennes in 1985  @xcite . in this model",
    "the collapsing chain was viewed as a `` sausage '' of collapse blobs . with time ,",
    "the sausage diameter increases and its length decreases .",
    "the driving free energy was identified with the interfacial free energy and the dissipation was attributed to hydrodynamic flow .",
    "a different view was later proposed by buguin , brochard - wyart and de gennes  @xcite . within this model",
    "the driving free energy is the transfer free energy into the dense phase .",
    "two scenarios were considered for the early collapse . in one ,",
    "the pearls form the vertices of a random walk .",
    "this scenario differs from the present model in two respects .",
    "first , the bridges joining the pearls are assumed to be unstretched .",
    "second , the associated dissipation arises only from the hydrodynamic flow .",
    "importantly , the collapse time within this picture does not depend on the number of pearls , @xmath239 in the second scenario , the chain is envisioned as a dumb - bell consisting of two pearls , @xmath256 joined by a stretched string of collapse blobs . the dissipation in this case is attributed to the stokes drag force on the pearls .",
    "most recently the problem was re - examined by klushin  @xcite . in this model",
    "the driving free energy is the transfer free energy to the dense phase and the dissipation is due to the stokes drag force .",
    "the chain is envisioned as a self - avoiding random walk of kuhn lengths . in turn , these can comprise either stretched bridges joining pearls or by a sequence of collinear pearls connected by stretched bridges .",
    "thus , the number of kuhn lengths can change either because of coalescence or because of the formation of a collinear sequence .",
    "the rate of change in the number of kuhn lengths is assumed to follow unimolecular kinetics .",
    "the characteristic time for this process is identified with that of a shrinking dumb - bell , assuming a constant size of the pearls .",
    "the number of pearls within a collinear sequence is assumed to decrease because monomer transfer or coalescence , both driven by the surface free - energy . within this model ,",
    "the collapse is largely due to the decrease in @xmath9 .",
    "the models of buguin et al .  and of klushin focus ,",
    "in effect , on the kinetics of the collapse of a pearl necklace and do not consider possible earlier events .    in principle",
    ", the langevin equation can provide a complete description of the collapse on all time - scales and thus allows for a systematic analysis of the problem .",
    "unfortunately , a rigorous and complete solution of the appropriate langevin equation is difficult .",
    "accordingly , all the langevin - type theories introduce certain approximations so as to reach a mathematically tractable formalism .",
    "the treatment is mathematically demanding , and often requires numerical calculations .",
    "a detailed comparison with phenomenological theories is difficult because of the very different formulations .",
    "it is interesting however to note that both the theory of garel _ at al . _",
    "@xcite and of kuzentsov et al .",
    "@xcite distinguish between two regimes in the early collapse : first , a very fast process , whose characteristic time is independent of @xmath4 and is thus interpreted as local rearrangement ; and second , a much slower process , reflecting large scale reorganization , with a characteristic time that increases with @xmath187    we hope that a full picture of the kinetics of collapse will eventually emerge from molecular dynamics simulations involving a polymer chain as well as solvent molecules .",
    "the currently available simulation studies do not account fully for hydrodynamics thus introducing an uncertainty in the interpretation of the results . in certain studies",
    "the interpretation is further hampered by the imposition of an `` all trans '' initial state  @xcite . with this caveat ,",
    "the simulations mostly support the notion that the collapse involves a string of pearls joined by stretched bridges as an intermediate stage .",
    "the configuration adopted by the string of pearls is less clear .",
    "snapshots of the chain configuration as obtained by langevin - equation simulation of byme et al .",
    "@xcite suggest an almost collinear string of pearls .",
    "the visualization of configurations obtained by monte carlo simulation of kuznetsov et al .",
    "@xcite reveal a random walk pearl necklace .",
    "these last two studies also suggest that the first step of the collapse involves the formation of localized clusters , and that subsequent cluster growth is attained by assimilating monomers from the bridges thus causing stretching .    _",
