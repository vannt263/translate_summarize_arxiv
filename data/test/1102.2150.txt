    "the quantum interface between light and an atomic ensemble has attracted much attention during the past decade @xcite . the reason is rooted in the wide range of possible applications that rely on the coherent coupling between the two systems : implementation of quantum information processing protocols @xcite , slow - light and electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite as well as the creation of deterministic and manipulable photon sources @xcite . in order to create these photon sources",

    "in this section , we will show how to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : working_hamiltonian ] ) and discuss the approximations used to obtain them . throughout this work",
    ", we will focus on the regime where the laser driving @xmath5 is the largest energy scale of the system .",
    "in addition , the detuning of the laser @xmath31 is taken to be much smaller than both the rabi frequency ( laser driving ) and the interaction strength such that @xmath32 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : working_hamiltonian ] ) contains spin operators that obey anti - commutation and commutation relations when they belong to the same and different sites , respectively .",
    "therefore , the underlying algebra is neither bosonic nor fermionic . in order to be able to solve the system",
    "at least approximately the spin operators will be expressed in terms of operators that obey a purely bosonic algebra .",

    "( [ eqn : holstein - primakoff ] ) into hamiltonian ( [ eqn : working_hamiltonian ] ) and consistently with the condition @xmath43 keep only the first two terms of the expansion of the square root .",
    "furthermore , we neglect all terms of the hamiltonian that are of higher order than quadratic in @xmath36 .",
    "the hamiltonian then assumes a quadratic form @xmath45 where the energy offset @xmath46 is given by @xmath47      a closer inspection of the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian_hp ] ) reveals that it is composed of three distinct parts ( @xmath48 ) which effectuate qualitatively different couplings between states with a fixed number of bosonic excitations .",

    "this coarse structure is formed by manifolds of quasi - degenerate states separated by energy gaps of approximately @xmath52 . as it is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , each manifold is formed by states that contain the same total number @xmath54 of bosonic excitations . taking this into account ,",
    "let us now analyze the rest of the terms of the hamiltonian one by one .",
    "the second term in @xmath53 does not change the total number of excitations of the state .",
    "its action produces couplings between states inside the same energy manifold , whose strength is proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath56 and @xmath57 create or destroy one and two excitations every time , respectively .",
    "since the states involved in these transitions are separated energetically by approximately @xmath52 and @xmath58 , respectively , they are strongly suppressed . in particular , the corresponding transition rates can be estimated by second order perturbation theory to be proportional to @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which in our parameter regime ( @xmath61 ) are very small quantities . as a consequence it can be affirmed that , to a very good degree of approximation , the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : ham_zero ] ) that drives the intra - manifold dynamics also governs the dynamics of the _",
    "entire system_. the validity of this approximation will be assessed in section [ sec : perturbations ] .",
    "we will now diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath53 [ eq .",

    "since it is quadratic this is achieved by means of the diagonalization of the matrix @xmath62 , that essentially contains the interaction energies between each pair of atoms .",
    "this is achieved by a unitary transformation which reads @xmath63 where @xmath64 represents the @xmath17-th entry of the @xmath65-th eigenvector of @xmath62 and @xmath66 is its corresponding eigenvalue . substituting the last expression into ( [ eqn : ham_zero ] )",
    ", the diagonalized hamiltonian becomes @xmath67 with the operators @xmath68 and the eigenvalues @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "hence , the _ collective excitations _ of the system are formed by a superposition of all the bosonic excitations @xmath71 , with the coefficients of the superposition given by the eigenvectors of @xmath62 .",
    "we can now write down the eigenstates and corresponding energies of the system",
    ". the ground state is @xmath72 and its energy is @xmath46 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ground ] ) .",
    "the first excited manifold is spanned by the @xmath0 states that possess one collective bosonic excitation , i.e. @xmath73 the manifold with @xmath74 is formed by all combinations of two of the @xmath0 eigenexcitations @xmath75 with @xmath76 , so that there exist a total number @xmath77 of these doubly excited states . following the same procedure",
    ", one could think of constructing states with higher numbers of excitations by applying more creation operators @xmath78 to the vacuum .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : ham_zero ] ) gives a valid description of the system only if @xmath43 , i.e. in the low - occupation sector of the spectrum where only a few bosonic excitations compared to the total number of atoms are present .",
    "our aim is to selectively excite the many - particle states described in the previous section starting from the experimentally relevant initial state in which all atoms are prepared in the electronic ground state @xmath79 to this purpose , we use the excitation scheme proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , that consists of two steps :    first , we want to achieve the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath53 , @xmath80 , which contains zero bosonic excitations .",
    "to do so , we express the single - atom bosonic states in terms of the atomic ones , so that the ground state yields @xmath81 .",
    "we also introduce an additional internal single atom stable state @xmath82 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice_and_levels]b ) . in practice",
    "@xmath82 could correspond to one of the states of the hyperfine ground state manifold which is different from @xmath83 . using this state",
    "we can prepare the desired state @xmath84 by means of the two subsequent laser pulses which are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice_and_levels]b .",
    "we choose the first pulse , with rabi frequency @xmath28 , to be resonant with the single - atom transition @xmath85 . after applying a @xmath86-pulse during a time @xmath87",
    ", this laser is turned off and another one with rabi frequency @xmath27 and resonant with @xmath88 is shone on the system during a time @xmath89 .",
    "this amounts to the sequence @xmath90\\\\\\nonumber   & \\stackrel{\\tau_2}{\\rightarrow } & \\prod_k \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\left|g\\right>_k-\\left|r\\right>_k\\right]=\\prod_k \\left|-\\right>_k=\\left|0\\right>\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which results in the desired preparation of @xmath84 .",
    "here we would like to remark that the strength of the second laser , given by its rabi frequency @xmath27 , has to be large enough to overcome the interaction energy between atoms in the rydberg state .",
    "the required strength will depend strongly on the particular geometry of the system .",
    "for example , in a square lattice each atom has four nearest neighbors , so that in this case the condition to be accomplished is roughly @xmath91 , while in a triangular lattice it would be @xmath92 as there are six nearest neighbors for each site .",
    "once the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : ham_zero ] ) is prepared , the aim is to excite the previously described many - particle states ( [ eqn : first_excited ] ) and ( [ eqn : second_excited ] ) that contain one and two bosonic excitations , respectively , thus belonging to higher energy manifolds .",
    "the idea proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite is to induce transitions between states with @xmath93 making use of the term of the hamiltonian proportional to the detuning , i.e. the first term of ( [ eqn : ham_one ] ) , @xmath94 which creates or annihilates one bosonic excitation at a time .",
    "the problem is that , as we discussed before , these transitions are highly suppressed due to the large value of the energy gap - approximately @xmath52 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] - between the manifolds . to overcome this difficulty",
    "one can introduce a time - dependent detuning of the form @xmath95 which will therefore act as a coherent oscillating source that couples the two many - body states considered when the oscillation frequency @xmath96 matches the corresponding energy gap between them .",
    "the intensity of the transition between the two states considered is calculated in each case by working out the square of the transition matrix elements @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 represent the initial and final state , respectively .",
    "let us first consider the excitation from the ground state @xmath84 to the first excited manifold of states ( [ eqn : first_excited ] ) that contain a single collective bosonic excitation .",
    "the intensity yields in this case @xmath100 where the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) has been made and @xmath69 is the corresponding energy gap between the state @xmath101 and the ground state .",
    "note that the rwa implies that the value of the energy gap - which is roughly proportional to @xmath5 - is much larger than the detuning , i.e. @xmath102 .",
    "following the same procedure , one can calculate the intensity of the transition between the one- and two - excitation states , that yield @xmath103 note that this expression already tells us that the intensity of the transition between the two states will be zero unless one of the excitations in the two - boson state is the same as the single one originally present , i.e. unless @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "other selection rules that stem from the particular geometry of the system will be analyzed in the following section .      when calculating the intensity of the transitions between the different manifolds following eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : i1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : i2 ] ) , we observe that only for a few states they have a non - zero value ( see figs . [",
    "fig : i1 ] and [ fig : i2 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this can be found considering the particular symmetries of the system .",
    "let us consider here two examples of geometries : a square and an equilateral triangular lattice .     that contains the symmetries of a square",
    "is formed by 8 elements : rotations of the lattice by @xmath106 and @xmath107 ; flip about the @xmath108 and @xmath109 axes ; flip about the diagonals @xmath110 and @xmath111 . *",
    "b * : the group @xmath112 contains the symmetries of an equilateral triangle , formed by 6 elements : rotations of @xmath113 and @xmath114 and flip about the axes @xmath115 and @xmath116 that go through the vertices of the triangle perpendicular to the opposite side . ]",
    "the symmetry groups corresponding to the square and the equilateral triangle are @xmath117 and @xmath112 , respectively .",

    "actually , both the experimentally relevant initial state @xmath129 and the ground state @xmath84 where no bosonic excitation is present , are eigenstates of the operators that represent _ all _ the rotations and flip operations that form the corresponding groups with eigenvalue @xmath130 .",
    "this is true for both the square and the triangular lattice .",
