    "very recently , a class of mass dimension one fermions named elko , initially proposed by ahluwalia and grumiller @xcite as a natural candidate to a fermionic dark matter particle , underwent a profound overhaul in the definition of their duals , culminating with a field that is local and lorentz covariant @xcite ( see also @xcite for some additional support ) .",
    "thus , the interest for such class of non - standard spinors ( nss ) , or dark spniors , has increased in recent years , since they are naturally neutral and has mass dimension one ] , which leads them to satisfy only a klein - gordon type equation . moreover , as neutral fields , they are good and natural candidate to particles of dark matter in the universe , an open problem in cosmology .    the elko field is constructed as a spin-@xmath1 field describing fermions that are eigenstate of the charge conjugation operator , satisfying the relation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the usual spinor and its dual , respectively , the index @xmath5 stands for the two possible helicities of the spinor and @xmath6 stands for the self - conjugate spinor ( s ) and anti - self - conjugate ( a ) .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "while profoundly altering the quantum structure of the field , this new dual definition for elko does not alter its classical formulation , so that cosmological applications remain valid .",
    "models in which the elko field is considered as candidate to dark matter or dark energy in the universe have been proposed recently @xcite . in this work",
    "we are interested in the elko field as a possible candidate to drive inflation , the matter dominated era and finishing as the responsible for the recent cosmic acceleration of the universe . in this final phase ,",
    "the elko field just rolls down to the minimum of a potential and acts as a cosmological constant term .    in this paper",
    "we study the elko field coupled to gravity in a einstein - cartan framework following recent results @xcite , and we show how it can be the responsible for all phases of the universe , starting as an inflaton field , something similar to the standard scalar field but with a much more rich structure , then reproducing the matter dominated era , since it is a natural candidate to dark matter , and finishing as a constant field that mimics exactly a cosmological constant term , according to the @xmath7cdm model .",
    "we start with a brief review of scalar field inflationary theory on section ii , its motivations and main results , and also pointing some difficulties .",
    "then , in section iii , we introduce the elko equations and study numerically how it can be a good candidate to an inflaton field and also the responsible for driving all phases of the universe .",
    "we finish in section iv with some concluding remarks . a brief appendix containing some details on the numerical analysis of the coupled system of equations",
    "is also presented .",
    "here we review briefly the inflationary model sourced by a scalar field @xmath8 , following the references @xcite . a good list of references can be found into @xcite .",
    "the einstein equations in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker metric are : @xmath9\\,,\\label{eqh}\\ ] ] @xmath10 @xmath11 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 the hubble expansion parameter , @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the energy density and pressure for the scalar field are given by @xmath17 @xmath18 given a potential @xmath19 , the inflation occurs if the slow - roll parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 satisfies @xcite : @xmath22 @xmath23 which justifies to neglect the kinetic term from ( [ eqh ] ) ( @xmath24 ) and the acceleration term from ( [ eqphi ] ) ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "although being necessary conditions to drive the inflation , the smallness of such parameters is not sufficient to guarantee that those terms can be neglected @xcite . sometimes , the additional assumption @xmath26 is also needed .",
    "such parameters are used to restrict the form of the potential in order to ensure the inflation starts .",
    "basically , these conditions ensure that the onset of expansion is approximately exponential , as required by all inflationary theories .",
    "an alternative expression of the condition to inflation occur is given by @xcite : @xmath27 showing that the comoving hubble length @xmath28 is decreasing with time .",
    "dozens of potential have been proposed in last decades in order to drive the inflationary phase of expansion of the universe .",
    "some of them have physical motivations whilst other are just placed by hand in order to furnish correct results .",
    "we present a list of some potentials that were recently confronted with the most recent observations of planck 2013 mission @xcite :    * power law potential ( or chaotic inflation ) : @xmath29 * exponential potential : @xmath30 * inverse power law potential : @xmath31 * hill - top models : @xmath32 * symmetry breaking potential : @xmath33 * natural inflation : @xmath34 * hybrid inflation ( multi fields ) : @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are parameters to be adjusted according to observations .    all these potential represent good models in order to drive the inflationary period of the universe for specific values of the constants , the main difference among them are fine tunings concerning the duration of inflation , its _ amount _ measured by the number of e - foldings @xmath38 , the correct transition to the end of the inflationary era , sometimes called reheating phase and most important , the correct prediction of density perturbations , responsible for the formation of galaxies and cluster of galaxies and also for the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "this last test throw away several potential , which reduces the number of models that deserve further studies . from the above potential , the cases ( [ v2 ] ) , ( [ v3 ] ) and ( [ v7 ] ) are outside the contours estimated by the planck 2013 observations @xcite .",
    "others are permitted just for specific values and ranges of the parameters .    as already pointed out above , another important characteristic of inflationary models",
    "is how the inflation ends . the scalar field ,",
    "after rolling down to the bottom of the potential , needs to leave the scene in order to next phase of the universe takes place . in other words ,",
    "the scalar field must decay to its minimum value in order not to act any more , @xmath39 .",
    "this process is called reheating .",
    "a hot universe at the end of the inflation is a necessary condition in order to radiation dominate and also the conventional matter start to form while the temperature is cooling down . in the modern inflationary model , the scalar field oscillates while rolls down to the bottom of the potential , transferring energy to other matter fields , or even decaying into standard particles .",
    "the details of reheating are an important subject into the inflationary cosmology .",
    "some models add a phenomenological decay term to the equation of motion of the scalar field ( after inflation , the term @xmath40 is important again ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is considered a decay rate of the field @xmath8 into other particles @xcite .",
    "such friction term is also needed to make fine adjustments in theory , not allowing inflation to occur forever for instance .",
    "it is important to stress that such term is placed by hand after inflation takes place , just in order to control the damping of oscillations during the reheating .    after all , having the inflation occurred , the scalar field rolling down to the bottom of the potential and oscillating accordingly with the last term of ( [ eqphig ] ) to correctly stop the inflation , a final key question still prevails .",
    "what is such scalar field ?",
    "it is named inflaton , the particle responsible for the inflation , but his very nature is not known yet .",
    "no fundamental scalar field has yet been detected in the nature , except the higgs field responsible for the electro - weak symmetry breaking .",
    "the breaking of other symmetries in supersymmetric models or grand unified theories also predicts the existence of several scalar fields .",
    "nevertheless , a bosonic spin 0 scalar field as a physical matter particle , interacting to form some kind of observed matter , is not known .",
    "all the observed matter in the universe are constituted by fermions , which motivated us to construct an inflationary model with the dark spinor field elko .",
    "being a good candidate to dark matter in the universe we have found that it can drive the inflation , the dark matter evolution after inflation and surprisingly also the recent accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "finally , since the dark matter does not interact electromagnetically with other baryonic matter , the presence of hot electromagnetic radiation after inflation also allows a short period where the radiation dominates , before the dark matter dominance .",
    "in a curved homogeneous and isotropic background we assume that the elko field fills all the space homogeneously @xcite , thus we can assume that it can be split into a time dependent part times a flat space - time dependent spinor part , namely , @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 stands here , for simplicity , for the two kinds and two helicities of elko , @xmath45 ( self - conjugate ) and @xmath46 ( anti - self - conjugate ) , satisfying @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the charge conjugation operator @xcite .",
    "the spinor can be normalized as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is its dual that must be conveniently defined @xcite .",
    "we choose to work with a positive norm spinor .",
    "another important characteristic that elko fields satisfies is that due to its mass dimension one the possible couplings of the field are limited . in particular , just for elko fields , the two allowed self - couplings are of the type @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "there are also the possibility to couple to a higgs field @xcite .",
    "the action for the elko field coupled to gravity in a homogeneous and isotropic metric has been already presented in the literature @xcite , for both torsion free and torsion coupled equations .",
    "the friedmann equations for the most general case , including torsion terms and derived by taking the euler - lagrange equations , are given by @xcite : @xmath53\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\bigg(1+{\\kappa^2\\phi^2\\over 8}\\bigg)h^2 \\,,\\label{h2a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath54\\bigg ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & -3\\bigg(1+{\\kappa^2\\phi^2\\over 8}\\bigg)h^2\\ , , \\label{hdota}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the motion equation for the scalar part of the elko field can be obtained by deriving the first equation and using the second one : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the only non - null torsion function in the specific case of a homogeneous and isotropic metric @xcite . after substituting ( [ hfa ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ h2a])-([eqphia ] ) and rearranging we are left with : @xmath57\\,,\\label{h2}\\ ] ] @xmath58\\,,\\label{hdot}\\ ] ] @xmath59 together the equations for energy density and pressure ( see appendix of @xcite for details ) : @xmath60 @xmath61    notice that the structure of such system of equations is much richer than those corresponding to a standard scalar field , eqs .",
    "( [ eqh])-([pphi ] ) . for this reason",
    "the elko field can be a good candidate to drive not only the inflationary phase of the universe , but also the subsequent phases , as dark matter evolution and accelerated expansion .",
    "in which follows we will considerer the above set of equations for each of these eras .",
    "+ ( a)(b )    + ( c)(d )      + ( a)(b )    + ( c)(d )    now let us start considering the elko field as a candidate to inflaton field in the universe .",
    "we will consider a symmetry breaking potential type plus a constant @xmath62 , namely : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with @xmath7 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 positive constants .",
    "it is well known that such kind of potential represents a particle of physical mass @xmath69 and has a minimum at @xmath70 .",
    "such minimum is zero if @xmath71 , as showed in figure 1 ( a ) ( black line ) , or shifted by @xmath62 , as showed in figure 1 ( a ) ( red line ) .",
    "following the chaotic inflationary model by linde @xcite we consider the pre - inflationary phase of the universe composed by elko fields distributed chaotically over all the space .",
    "in particular we consider that most of fields satisfiesgev , thus our only requirement is @xmath72 which may be achieved if @xmath73 for the potential ( [ potential ] ) . from now on we will write explicitly @xmath74 . ] @xmath75gev and if the inflation occurs at about @xmath76s @xmath77gev@xmath78 we have @xmath0 , thus the last terms of ( [ hdot ] ) and ( [ phielko ] ) can be discard and we have @xmath79\\,,\\label{eqhe}\\ ] ] @xmath80 @xmath81    except for the term inside curl brackets ( that is important only in the limit @xmath82 ) these expressions are quite equivalent to ( [ eqh])-([eqphi ] ) .",
    "such impressive result shows that all successful inflationary models with a ( unknown ) scalar field can now be used here , where the inflaton field is the elko field , a much more physically reasonable field that is a natural candidate to dark matter particle .",
    "in particular , the slow - roll condition ( [ eqvl ] ) responsible for the beginning of the inflation is maintained ( considering @xmath83 ) , since that the ratio @xmath84 will exactly cancel the term inside curl brackets , which ensures that such inflationary model starts exactly as in the standard scalar field model .",
    "for the second slow - roll condition ( [ eqvll ] ) it can be shown that it is written as : @xmath85 so that when @xmath86 the expression ( [ eqvll ] ) is recovered and when @xmath87 we have @xmath88 .",
    "after inflation start the field must decay according to the general equations ( [ h2])-([phielko ] ) .",
    "we will present some numerical results for the complete system of equations ( [ h2])-([pphielko ] ) taking the particular potential ( [ potential ] ) in order to illustrate the validity of the model ( see appendix for some details ) . before that , let us make some estimates on the parameters of @xmath19 in order to reproduce viable models of inflation .",
    "first notice that the parameter @xmath67 is an energy scale that characterize the final evolution of the field @xmath8 , since that the initial field @xmath89 rolls down to the bottom of the potential and when @xmath90 the potential vanish , @xmath91 and the inflationary mechanism ends . in this sense",
    "it will characterize the number of e - foldings of the inflation .",
    "it is also directly related to the physical mass of the field , together the parameter @xmath7 , from ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 characterizes the total potential energy of the field and a strong constraint into it is @xmath92 , which guarantees that the field energy is bellow planck scale .",
    "we also expect inflation to occur after a initial time @xmath93s , since that we do not know exactly what happens before such time and finish at about @xmath94s .",
    "after that the universe expand according to the standard model of cosmology .",
    "now we will present the numerical results for the following set of parameters : @xmath71 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97gev .",
    "for our model we have at the beginning of inflation : @xmath98 which leads to @xmath99s , a very reasonable value .",
    "notice also that for such @xmath100 we have @xmath101 , which guarantees the condition @xmath92 . also , for such parameters we have @xmath102 and @xmath103 for the slow roll parameters ( [ eqvl ] ) and ( [ eqvllelko ] ) . the physical mass for such field is @xmath104gev and the value of the self - coupling constant is @xmath105 .",
    "figure 1 ( b ) shows the numerical result for the scale factor evolution for the parameters indicated in the figure .",
    "we see that the scale factor grows for several order of magnitude from an initial time @xmath106 up to a final time of about @xmath107s as expected ( @xmath108 characterize the end of inflation , and we are using @xmath109 in the numerical analysis ) .",
    "the scale factor grows from @xmath110 to @xmath111 during the inflationary phase , which leads to an e - folding number of about @xmath112 , in reasonable accord to modern theories of inflation .",
    "we have also verified numerically that the choice of the initial value of the field @xmath100 alters drastically the amount of e - foldings without to alter significantly its duration , which is more sensitive to changes on the @xmath7 parameter .",
    "greater the values of @xmath7 smaller the duration of inflation . after this",
    "we observe that the exponential evolution stops and the universe evolves in a non - accelerating phase .",
    "figure 1 ( c ) shows the numerical behaviour for the field @xmath113 .",
    "it starts from @xmath114 and @xmath115 and rolls down to the bottom of the potential , oscillating around its minimal value of @xmath116 in this case .",
    "the black line shows the numerical result for the complete eq .",
    "( [ phielko ] ) , including its last term , and red line shows the behaviour in the absent of the last term .",
    "it is clear that the presence of the last term causes a kind of damping while the field rolls down , delaying its fall to the bottom of the potential .",
    "such behaviour is an analogous to that one of the phenomenological term proportional to @xmath42 for the standard scalar field ( [ eqphig ] ) .",
    "figure 1 ( d ) shows the evolution of @xmath117 , showing that its time derivative are negative up to about @xmath118 , as required by ( [ condinflation ] ) .",
    "another very important quantity concerning the elko field during its evolution is its energy density @xmath119 , given by ( [ rhoelko ] ) . during the inflationary phase we expect it to be nearly constant . at the end of inflation the energy density of the universe",
    "must be about @xmath120g/@xmath121 , depending exactly when the inflation ends @xcite . in figure 2 ( a ) we plot in a logarithm scale the numerical result for the energy density ( [ rhoelko ] ) during inflation and",
    "just after it .",
    "it is clear that the energy density is nearly constant and then decreases abruptly after about @xmath122 .",
    "if the inflation ends at about @xmath118 , the corresponding energy density at this time is about @xmath123g/@xmath124 , in a good accord to estimates of standard model .",
    "this is an important constraint of the model .",
    "now let us analyse how is the behaviour of the elko field after inflation .",
    "as already indicated by the figure 1 ( b ) , after inflation the scale factor evolution change its concavity and another phase of the evolution takes place .",
    "it is well known from the standard model of cosmology that the next phase is a radiation dominated universe , scaling as @xmath125 , since that the hot universe just after inflation is the responsible for the cmb radiation observed today , as the universe cools .",
    "after radiation the universe enters a phase dominated by dark matter , scaling as @xmath126 , when particles stops its collisions and galaxies and cluster of galaxies start to form .",
    "contrary to the standard inflationary model constructed with a scalar field , where the inflaton field must decay to zero during the reheating in order to radiation and dark matter start to dominate , in our model constructed with the elko field the evolution continues driven by equations ( [ h2])-([pphielko ] ) .",
    "in figure 2 ( b ) we show the numerical analysis for the evolution of the scale factor for a very long time after inflation ( black line ) , with the same parameters before .",
    "we also plotted in the same figure a scale factor evolution of the form @xmath126 ( red line ) for a matter dominated universe , just for comparison .",
    "it is clear from the analysis of the figure that the evolution after inflation is exactly like a matter dominated universe , as expected , since the elko field has exactly the physical characteristics of a dark matter particle . due to numerical limitations ( long time of calculations )",
    ", we can not cover all the time scale up to present time for the evolution of the scale factor .",
    "nevertheless , having the function that plots the evolution after inflation , namely @xmath127 , we can extrapolate such function up to present time .",
    "this is shown in figure 2 ( c ) ( red line ) in a logarithm scale . in black line",
    "we shown the numerical result for @xmath128 up to @xmath129 .",
    "notice that the end of time scale is about @xmath130s , exactly today .",
    "the scale factor growth to about @xmath131 , in good accord to standard model @xcite .",
    "another way to analyse such evolution is by mean of the equation of state parameter : @xmath132 a numerical analysis for @xmath133 taking ( [ rhoelko])-([pphielko ] ) is showed in figure 2 ( d ) .",
    "after start from @xmath134 , a vacuum type equation of state parameter , responsible for the acceleration during inflation , the equation of state parameter starts to oscillate .",
    "the first amplitude grows from @xmath135 to slightly above @xmath136 while the second grows from @xmath135 to above 0 .",
    "it is clear that the average oscillation is around 0 , showing that during all the future evolution the equation of state parameter is of dust type , as required by a dark matter field .      as a final remark",
    "let us see how we can address to this model the recent accelerated evolution of the universe .",
    "looking for the potential from figure 1 ( a ) with @xmath71 ( black line ) , it is clear that as the field rolls down to its average value @xmath137 and goes to the bottom of the potential we have @xmath138 and the evolution follows as @xmath126 .",
    "but we have noticed that , if the potential is slightly shifted by a small @xmath62 , we have @xmath139 and such term will act exactly as a cosmological constant term at the future evolution of the universe .    in figure 3",
    "we shows the numerical analysis for the scale factor in the presence of such term .",
    "it is clear that the universe starts in an inflationary phase at @xmath140 that ends at @xmath108 , then it passes a phase nearly proportional to @xmath126 from @xmath108 to @xmath141 and then it starts a new accelerating phase after @xmath142 . in the numerical analysis",
    "we have used @xmath143 , but since that the time scale where acceleration start is very far in the future , we present the figure in arbitrary time scale .",
    "it is also obvious that the actual accelerating phase is much more smooth than the inflationary evolution , and also occur more in future than represented in the figure 3 , but we have also verified numerically that the instant of time where the acceleration start to dominate is dependent just on @xmath62 . when @xmath144 the crossing between the two curves of figure 3 will occur each more in the future , namely @xmath145 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath62 must be constrained by observations .",
    "in this paper we have studied a cosmological scenery where the elko field subject to a symmetry breaking potential is the only matter content of the universe . following the chaotic inflationary model , for an elko field characterized by @xmath113 at an initial energy scale @xmath146 , we have obtained numerically that the dynamical evolution of the elko field rolling down to the bottom of a symmetry breaking potential has the desired properties of an inflaton field , under some conditions on the fixed parameters of the potential .",
    "the slow - roll conditions for the system were obtained in the limit @xmath0 and it was showed that they are satisfied for the initial conditions in the present case .",
    "after a nearly exponential growth of the scale factor for about @xmath94s the field enters a dark matter evolution phase as @xmath126 , oscillating around the minimum of the potential , resting at an energy of about @xmath147 , where the potential energy is null . by making an extrapolation of the curve @xmath127 up today , we have found that the scale factor growth for about @xmath131 order of magnitude , in good accord to standard model .",
    "also , for the energy density of the field at the end of inflation we obtain @xmath148g/@xmath124 , also in good accord to standard model .",
    "such constraint is an important consequence of the model , since that after inflation ends the universe must evolve dominated by its matter contend , in this case just the elko field .",
    "if the potential is slightly shifted by a constant term , the scale factor enters a new phase similar to a cosmological constant dominated universe , reproducing the actual accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "another interesting properties naturally follows from the system of equations .",
    "the first is their very similar form as the standard scalar field in the limit @xmath0 .",
    "also the presence of a correction term similar to a kind of damping term that must be placed by hand in the standard scalar field model of inflation . here",
    "such term appears naturally . while the field is rolling down to the bottom of the potential its equation of state parameter goes from @xmath135 to an average oscillation around zero , what guarantees a dark matter evolution after the initial exponential growth .",
    "we have verified numerically that greater value of the initial field @xmath100 greater the number of e - foldings of the inflationary expansion .",
    "the @xmath67 parameter also alters the number of e - foldings .",
    "greater the value of the parameter @xmath7 into the potential lesser the duration of the inflationary exponential growth .",
    "all the parameters involved must be better constrained by observational data , nevertheless such numerical analysis shows clearly that most of the important properties that characterizes an inflationary model are present , deserving future investigations in order to place the elko field as a good candidate to drive all the phases of evolution of the universe .",
    "in this appendix we will briefly present in a few more details the numerical method for solution of the coupled system of differential equations ( [ h2])-([pphielko ] ) in order to produces the figures of section iii .",
    "we use the detools package from maple 15 software , where numerical solutions are found by the method @xmath149 , which is an extension of the @xmath150 method , which finds a numerical solution using a fehlberg fourth - fifth order runge - kutta method with degree four of interpolation .    for the figures concerning the scale factor @xmath128 and the field @xmath113 we use the equations ( [ h2 ] ) and ( [ phielko ] ) in the form : @xmath151}=0\\,,\\label{a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath152 ^ 2{\\phi(t)\\over ( 1+\\kappa^2\\phi(t)^2/8)^2}=0\\,,\\label{a2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the differential equation for @xmath128 is of first order while for @xmath113 is second order . given a potential @xmath19 we just need three initial conditions : @xmath153    for the figures 1 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , figure 2 ( a ) and ( b ) we have used @xmath110 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath154 , @xmath71 and @xmath155 . in figure 3 ( black line )",
    "we use the same parameters before with @xmath156 .",
    "we have used @xmath157 with @xmath158 .",
    "thus all the time scales are in units of @xmath159 .    for the figure 2 ( b )",
    "notice that the pressure ( [ pphielko ] ) contain a term @xmath160 , which requires an initial condition for @xmath161 . to work around this issue",
    "we have used the expression ( [ hdot ] ) for @xmath160 in the form : @xmath162\\,,\\label{a4}\\ ] ] into the corresponding term of ( [ pphielko ] ) , thus the differential equation is of first order and the above initial conditions are sufficient to evaluate @xmath133 .",
