    "generation of nonclassical states of light has been a subject of interest for many years @xcite . in particular , the preparation of coherent - state superpositions @xcite have attracted special attention @xcite due to their important role in many quantum information applications , such as quantum information processing @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , and quantum - based precision measurements @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the special case of squeezed coherent - state superpositions has shown to be useful for many quantum information protocols , including quantum teleportation and single - qubit gates @xcite , mainly because of its robustness against dissipative effects @xcite , and the large amplitudes that can be experimentally achieved @xcite .",
    "different schemes for the generation of coherent - state superpositions have been proposed and realized over the years . among these , we can mention schemes based on photon - number state and homodyne detection @xcite , cavity qed @xcite , two - photon subtraction or addition @xcite , and kerr nonlinearities @xcite . among these proposals , interaction schemes based on the kerr effect",
    "have been extensively criticized , mainly because kerr nonlinearities are generally weak , thus requiring a long interaction time between the field and the nonlinear medium . because in experiments we are dealing with open systems , during a long interaction time dissipation effects ( such as decoherence )",
    "may destroy coherent quantum superpositions , making kerr - based schemes seem unrealistic .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is by implementing schemes where strong kerr nonlinearities are used @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the strong nonlinearity regime , the environment will affect the optical system during a _",
    "shorter _ interaction time , thus making the nonlinear interaction effect more dominant than decoherence .",
    "another alternative is to use weak nonlinearities together with small initial amplitudes of the field , as it has been shown that in this regime decoherence effects are negligible @xcite .    in this work",
    "we analyze a system , based on a tunable optical cavity filled with a nonlinear kerr medium , that may be used for the preparation of squeezed coherent - state superpositions .",
    "we obtain a closed expression for an arbitrary initial state of the system and demonstrate that , under certain conditions , squeezed - state superpositions can be generated within the cavity .",
    "furthermore , we show that the squeezing degree of the produced states can be easily tuned , a feature that may lead to interesting studies in the field of quantum state engineering .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : model ] , we present the theoretical model of the analyzed system . in section [",
    "sect : squeezed ] , we describe a particular , exactly solvable , example in which squeezed - state superpositions , with tunable degree of squeezing , can be produced inside the cavity . in section [",
    "sect : wigner ] , we analyze the nonclassical features of the generated states by evaluating their wigner phase - space distribution . finally , in section [ sect : conclusions ] , a summary of the results is provided .",
    "let us consider a system comprising an optical cavity filled with a nonlinear kerr medium .",
    "we assume that the cavity contains just one mode of the electromagnetic field and that its length , and therefore its frequency , can change during time evolution .",
    "this system could be experimentally realized by making use of a high - finesse piezo - driven tunable optical cavity @xcite filled with a low density atomic medium working under eit conditions @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the described system is governed by the time - dependent schrdinger equation , with @xmath0 , @xmath1 where the time - dependent anharmonic - oscillator hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath2 } + \\chi{\\left ( \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a } \\right)}^{2},\\ ] ] with @xmath3 being the time - dependent frequency of the oscillator , and @xmath4 the third order nonlinear susceptibility of the medium .    in principle",
