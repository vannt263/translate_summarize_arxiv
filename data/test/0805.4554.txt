    "no hair conjecture @xcite demands the non existence of any information other than mass , charge and angular momentum of a black hole .",

    "another calculation @xcite showed that the static spherically symmetric exterior solutions of the gravitational field equations in a wide class of scalar tensor theories would essentially reduce to the well known schwarzschild solutions once the event horizon had hidden the singularity .",

    "scalar hair was reported in asymptotically anti - de sitter space time and asymptotically flat space time and it is widely believed that black holes with scalar hair generally exist when the scalar potential has negative region @xcite .",
    "there is no regular black hole solution when the scalar field is massless or has a `` convex '' potential .",
    "it is widely reported that there are no static asymptotically flat and asymptotically ads black holes with spherical scalar hair if the scalar field theory , when coupled to gravity , satisfies the positive energy theorem @xcite .",

    "but an unexpected development of scalar hair in ads black hole with minimal @xcite as well as nonminimal @xcite coupling of scalar field , demanded a heuristic study of scalar hair @xcite .",
    "as a strong interpretation , black hole has hair if there is a need to specify quantities other than the conserved charges defined at asymptotic infinity in order to characterize completely a stationary black hole solution @xcite .",
    "efforts were done to reveal strong hair @xcite and they came up with a scalar solution conformally coupled to einstein s gravity through a metric for extremal case .",

    "hence strong interpretation of scalar hair is not guaranteed .",
    "the motivation of the present work is to know whether a strong interpretation of the scalar hair can be possible in a static ( 3 + 1 ) black hole , which requires a nontrivial solution of scalar field in the vicinity of black hole with regular horizon .    in this paper",
    ", we report a nontrivial black hole solution of a massive but self interacting scalar field showing no divergence at the horizon and asymptotically falling to the vacuum value . the proposed metric shows trace of scalar charge .    whether a nontrivial scalar solution and a metric with a horizon are mutually compatible has been the objective of scalar hair investigation .",
