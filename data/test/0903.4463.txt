    "gaining control over the external and the internal degrees of freedom of molecules is of great interest for a range of areas in molecular science .",
    "one approach , dating as far back as the 1920s  @xcite , relies on the application of inhomogenous ( static or low frequency ) magnetic and electric fields .",
    "this has proven most useful for controlling the full three - dimensional motion of molecules , including control of the velocity distribution , bringing molecules to a stand still , storing them for extended periods of times and trapping them in a confined volume ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative and complementary approach relies on the use of non - resonant non - ionizing laser fields typically supplied by pulsed lasers .",
    "many studies during the last decade have shown that strong non - resonant laser fields can effectively manipulate the external degrees of freedom of isolated gas phase molecules .",
    "the manipulation results from laser - induced forces and torques due to the interaction between the induced dipole moment and the laser field itself .",
    "examples of manipulation include deflection  @xcite , focusing  @xcite and slowing  @xcite of molecules through the dependence of the non - resonant polarizability interaction on the intensity distribution in a laser focus .",
    "likewise , the dependence of the induced dipole interaction on molecular orientation has proven highly useful for controlling the rotation of a variety of molecules  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the spatial orientation of molecules can be sharply confined with respect to axes that are fixed in the laboratory .",
    "molecular manipulation by induced dipole forces extends beyond the external degrees of freedom and has also been demonstrated for the internal degrees of freedom such as vibrational motion  @xcite in molecular hydrogen .",
    "notably , the electrical field from laser pulses can modify energy potential barriers such that photoinduced bond breakage of a small linear molecule is guided to yield a desired final product  @xcite .    in the case of larger molecules control of the lowest frequency vibrational modes",
    "attracts special interest since some of these modes correspond to motion along well - defined reaction coordinates separating two conformational minima ( conformers ) .",
    "although many molecules contain large number of conformers it is often just two conformers that dominate important chemical properties , for instance chirality .",
    "a particularly important example is found in axially chiral molecules  @xcite such as biaryl systems . in these molecules rotation about a single stereogenic carbon - carbon ( c - c ) bond axis changes the molecule from one enantiomer into the opposite enantiomer ( mirror image ) .",
    "recently , we demonstrated that the laser - induced nonresonant polarizability interaction can also be used to influence the internal rotation of an axially chiral molecule around the stereogenic c - c bond axis  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we showed that by fixing the c - c bond axis of a substituted biphenyl molecule in space , using laser induced alignment by a long laser pulse , it was possible to initiate torsional motion of the two phenyl rings by a short laser pulse polarized perpendicular to the fixed axis .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to extend our recent paper  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we discuss our theoretical modelling in detail .",
    "a ns laser pulse aligns @xcite the stereogenic axis of 3,5-diflouro-3,5-dibromo - biphenyl ( dfdbrbph ) along its polarization .",
    "this enables a much shorter fs pulse , which we will refer to as the kick pulse , to both initiate torsional motion and set the molecule into rotation around the fixed axis .",
    "the internal as well as external rotational motion is monitored by fs time - resolved coulomb explosion imaging .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a model of the dfdbrbph molecule with the stereogenic axis marked by red . according to our quantum chemical calculations , the laser - free torsional potential , illustrated by the red dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , has minima at dihedral angles of @xmath0 corresponding to the r@xmath1 and s@xmath1 enantiomeric forms , and where the dihedral angle is the angle between the two phenyl rings .",
    "the twisted equilibrium shape is characteristic of biphenyl compounds .",
    "the traditional view is that this non - planarity results from competition between stabilization via conjugation of the @xmath2-orbital systems and steric repulsion between the ortho - positioned atoms @xcite .",
    "we might mention that alternative explanations have recently been discussed @xcite .",
    "our strategy for controlling @xmath3 relies on a transient modification of the field - free potential curve by a fs kick pulse ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the modification , caused by the nonresonant polarizability interaction  @xcite converts the initial stationary quantum states , localized near the minima of the torsional potential , into vibrational wave packets , i.e. , coherent superpositions of several quantum states .",
    "the temporal evolution of these wave packets gives rise to time - dependent torsional motion , and the grey and the black curves in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] show the calculated expectation values of @xmath3 for a particular set of laser parameters .",
    "the stereogenic c - c bond axis is fixed in the laboratory frame by adiabatic alignment utilizing a moderately intense , linearly polarized ns laser pulse @xcite .",
    "the ns pulse is intense enough to keep the c - c axis tightly confined , yet weak enough to modify the torsional potential only slightly .",
    "the fs kick pulse is applied with its polarization perpendicular to the aligned c - c bond axis to ensure primarily influence on torsion while avoiding other possible vibrational motion .",
    "the dfdbrbph compound is prepared as a racemate and the experiment is carried out on isolated molecules at rotational temperatures of a few kelvin . under these conditions we have equal numbers of molecules initially localized in the @xmath4 or 39@xmath5 conformation ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) and no thermally induced transitions between the two conformations occur .",
    "the intense probe pulse , sent at time @xmath6 with respect to the kick pulse , removes several electrons from the molecules , thereby triggering coulomb explosion into ionic fragments .",
    "in particular , the br@xmath7 and f@xmath7 fragment ions recoil in the planes defined by the br- and f - phenyl rings . by recording the velocities of both ion species with two - dimensional ion imaging @xcite",
    ", we determine the instantaneous orientation of each of the two phenyl planes at the time of the probe pulse .     between the br- and f - phenyl planes .",
    "the asymmetry in the potential is obtained by orienting the molecules ( here with the br - phenyl plane out of the paper ) , 3d aligning them , and by polarizing the kick pulse at an angle of 13@xmath5 with respect to the second most polarizable axis ( smpa ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the red dotted curve at large times illustrates the laser - free time - independent torsional potential . for the s@xmath1 enantiomer , starting out with @xmath8 , the time varying potential induces an oscillatory motion ( grey curve ) corresponding to torsion confined within the initial well .",
    "by contrast , due to the induced asymmetry between the two wells , the initial r@xmath1 enantiomer is traversing the central torsional barrier , and ends up as an s@xmath1 enantiomer undergoing internal rotation ( black curve ) .",
    "the kick pulse has an intensity of @xmath9 w@xmath10@xmath11 and a duration of 1.0 ps ( fwhm ) .",
    "the torsional motion may be monitored by fs time - resolved coulomb explosion imaging .",
    "the inset shows a model of the dfdbrbph molecule with the sterogenic axis marked by red ( grey ) . ]",
    "to account for the motion of the nuclei of the dfdbrbph molecule we make use of two sets of coordinate systems ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) : a molecular fixed ( mf ) frame attached to the molecule and a laboratory fixed ( lf ) frame specified by the lasers .",
    "the mf coordinates are chosen with the @xmath12 axis along the stereogenic axis pointing from the phenyl ring with the bromines towards the phenyl ring with the flourines , and the @xmath13 axis is chosen along the phenyl ring with the bromines .",
    "the lf coordinates are chosen with the @xmath14 axis along the polarization direction of the ns pulse and the @xmath15 axis along the kick pulse polarization direction . in agreement with the experimental observations ( cf .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) , we assume that the stereogenic axis of the dfdbrbph molecule is aligned along the @xmath14 axis .     and the laboratory fixed @xmath16 coordinate axes .",
    "the dotted line indicates the second most polarizable axis ( smpa ) , which is located 11@xmath5 from the br - phenyl ring and 28@xmath5 from the f - phenyl ring . ]",
    "also , we neglect all normal modes , except the lowest one , which corresponds to torsion ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : qmcalc ] for details on quantum chemical calculations , justifying , e.g. , this assumption ) . in this simplified situation and in the absence of the kick pulse",
    "the task is reduced to describing the coupled rotations of the two ( rigid ) phenyl rings of the molecule as given in the lf frame by the hamiltonian [ atomic units , @xmath17 , are used throughout unless indicated otherwise ] @xmath18 where @xmath19 , is the angle of the @xmath20 phenyl ring with respect to the kick pulse polarization axis , @xmath21 the moment of inertia for rotation of the @xmath20 phenyl ring around the stereogenic axis ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is the laser - free torsional potential as obtained from quantum chemical calculations ( fig .  3 ) . by changing the coordinates to the dihedral angle @xmath25 between the two phenyl rings and the weighted azimuthal angle @xmath26 , characterizing the rotation of the molecule , with @xmath27 , we obtain @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the total moment of inertia of the molecule for rotation around the stereogenic axis and @xmath30 is a relative moment of inertia for the two phenyl rings around the axis .",
    "a full rotation of either phenyl ring leaves us with the same molecule implying @xmath31-periodic boundary conditions of the eigenfunctions of @xmath32 from eq .  ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 integers .",
    "we shall assume that this property also applies to @xmath36 and @xmath3 , so that we simply need to consider eigenfunctions @xmath37 of eq .",
    "that separates into rotation of the molecule as described by the @xmath31-periodic function @xmath38 and torsion accounted for by the @xmath31-periodic function @xmath39 .",
    "[ rigorously , the bounds for @xmath36 depend on @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "at the time scales of interest , however , a molecule generally only makes a small fraction of a full rotation so that the effect of @xmath36-@xmath3 coupling is negligible . ] the separation is physically motivated by considering the energy scales related to rotation and torsion .",
    "the energy scale of the prior is given by @xmath40ev .",
    "for torsion , on the other hand , the relevant energy is determined by the torsional potential , and a harmonic approximation of the potential near the minimum at @xmath41 yields a frequency corresponding to the energy @xmath42  mev . using that the period of motion is of the order planck s constant divided by the energy",
    ", we therefore see that the molecule rotates ( @xmath36 change ) on a nanosecond time scale , whereas the torsion ( @xmath3 change ) is of picosecond duration .",
    "the small energy separation of the rotational levels compared to that of the torsional levels implies that many rotational states will be occupied in thermal equillibrium .",
    "consequently , we expect the @xmath36 dynamics to behave classically ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , and we only treat the torsional dynamics quantum mechanically .",
    "the torsion is described by the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath43 with @xmath44 denoting the energy eigenstates . to solve this equation",
    "we expand the hamiltonian onto an orthonormal basis of @xmath31-periodic functions , which we diagonalize .",
    "the eigenstates below the torsional barriers exhibit an almost exact fourfold degeneracy , and linear combinations of the approximately degenerate states will also be stable at the time scales of the experiment .",
    "in particular , we can produce such stable states that are localized in the wells of the torsional potential .",

    "first , we establish that the ns pulse is able to hold the c - c bond axis of dfdbrbph along its polarization direction . at @xmath71 ps the f@xmath7 image , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , is almost circularly symmetric and the small deviation from circular symmetry is explained by noting that the kick pulse has a finite value at @xmath72 ps .",
    "the absence of ions in the innermost region is only compatible with the c - c bond axis being aligned perpendicular to the detector plane and the f - phenyl planes uniformly distributed around the c - c bond axis .",
    "the corresponding br@xmath7 image is also essentially circularly symmetric although the hollow - out of the center is not as pronounced as for f@xmath7 .",
    "next , we investigate the effect of the kick pulse .",
    "already at @xmath73 ps the circular symmetry is broken and both f@xmath7 and br@xmath7 ions start to localize around the polarization direction of the kick pulse .",
    "the f@xmath7 ions remain within the radial range of the ring structure , which shows that the kick pulse does not cause any significant distortion of the c - c bond axis alignment but rather initiates an overall rotation of the molecule around this axis .",
    "the latter is expected since the torque imparted by the kick pulse will force the smpa ( fig .  2 ) to align along the kick pulse polarization after a delay determined by the kick strength . at @xmath74",
    "ps the localization sharpens for both ions species , but whereas the br@xmath7 ions are simply more localized around the polarization axis the f@xmath7 ion distribution exhibits a four dot structure .",
    "this behaviour is compatible with alignment of the smpa along the kick pulse polarization . in the limit of perfect smpa alignment",
    ", the br@xmath7 ions would appear as two pairs of strongly localized regions on the detector corresponding to molecules with their br - phenyl plane located either 11@xmath5 clockwise or counterclockwise to the smpa . each pair of br@xmath7 ions",
    "would then be angularly separated by 22@xmath5 . in practise and",
    "consistent with theory ( see fig .  [ fig8 ] ) the smpa alignment is not strong enough to resolve the two br@xmath7 regions .",
    "it is , however , sharp enough to resolve the two pairs of f@xmath7 ion hits due to the much larger offset ( 28@xmath5 ) of the f - phenyl plane from the smpa . at @xmath75 ps",
    "the br@xmath7 distribution has localized further showing that the br - phenyl plane has rotated into stronger alignment with the kick pulse polarization .",
    "if the torsion was unaffected , i.e. , @xmath3 remained unchanged , the f@xmath7 ion image at @xmath75 ps should exhibit a distinct four - dot structure similar to the image at @xmath76 ps but with a larger angular splitting between the ion regions in each of the two pairs . clearly , the four - dot structure at 2.47 ps is significantly blurred compared to the case at 1.47 ps .",
    "thus , we conclude that the kick pulse not only sets the molecule into controlled rotation around the c - c axis , it also initiates torsional motion .    beyond 3.8 ps the angular confinement of both the f@xmath7 and the br@xmath7 ions",
    "is gradually lost due to continued rotation around the c - c axis with dihedral dynamics imposed , and the images for both ion species eventually regain their circularly symmetric form ( see images at 12.15 ps in fig .  [ fig6](a ) ) identical to the pre - kick pulse images at -0.87 ps .",
    "further insight into the effect of the kick pulse is obtained by analyzing the angular distribution of the f@xmath7 ions as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "an example of the f@xmath7 angular distribution at @xmath6 = 1.47 ps is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) . figure  [ fig6](c ) displays the average angle between the f - phenyl rings and the kick pulse polarization as a function of @xmath6 in the time interval where a clear four - peak structure is visible in the angular distributions .",
    "the increase from 22.5@xmath5 at 1.47 ps to 26.5@xmath5 at 3.8 ps shows that the f - phenyl plane gradually moves away from the kick pulse polarization due to the overall rotation of the molecule around the c - c bond axis , and we ascribe the recurrent dips to a periodical variation in @xmath3 .",
    "we estimate the period to be @xmath77 ps and the amplitude to @xmath78 for this oscillation .    before presenting the theoretical results on dfdbrbph ,",
    "we want to confirm the validity of the classical treatment of rotation .",
    "to this end we apply the model to a test case , where the simpler 3,5-diflouroiodobenzene ( dfib ) has its most polarizable axis fixed by a ns laser pulse and is then set into rotation about this axis by an orthogonally polarized femtosecond pulse . here , there is no torsion and the rotational dynamics have been observed directly recently  @xcite . in fig .",

    "also , at @xmath74 ps the confinement of the br - phenyl rings at a small angle with respect to the kick pulse polarization predicts a much less distinct , if any , four - dot structure in good agreement with the br@xmath7 ion image . at @xmath75 ps the angular localization of the f - phenyl rings has broadened ( right panel , fig .  [ fig8](a ) ) and a blurred four - dot structure",

    "the period agrees well with the experimental value ( @xmath82 ps ) , and smaller modulation in @xmath83 is expected in the experiment ( @xmath84 ) partly since here the smpa is not pre - aligned and partly due to deviations from the stated laser peak intensity .",

    "theory  @xcite and experiment  @xcite show that orientation can be added to 3d alignment by combining the ns alignment pulse with a static electric field .",
    "next , the excitation of torsional motion is optimized by eliminating initial rotation around the c - c bond through alignment of the smpa ( fig .",
    "2 ) prior to the kick pulse using an elliptically rather than a linearly polarized ns pulse @xcite . finally , the interaction strength between the molecule and the kick pulse needs to be increased either through higher intensity , a longer kick pulse or by trains of synchronized kick pulses  @xcite .     or ( b ) an s@xmath1 enantiomer .",
    "initially , the molecule is 3d oriented with the br - phenyl end pointing out of the paper and the smpa aligned at an angle of 13@xmath5 with respect to the kick pulse polarization .",

    "the torsional potential is scaled down by 1/4 rather than by increasing the kick strength . in practise reduction of the torsional barrier",

    "<S> it is demonstrated that strong laser pulses can introduce torsional motion in the axially chiral molecule 3,5-diflouro-3,5-dibromo - biphenyl ( dfdbrbph ) . </S>",
    "<S> a nanosecond laser pulse spatially aligns the stereogenic carbon - carbon ( c - c ) bond axis allowing a perpendicularly polarized , intense femtosecond pulse to initiate torsional motion accompanied by a rotation about the fixed axis . </S>",
    "<S> we monitor the induced motion by femtosecond time - resolved coulomb explosion imaging . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical analysis corroborates the experimental findings and on the basis of these results we discuss future applications of laser induced torsion , viz . , time - resolved studies of de - racemization and laser controlled molecular junctions based on molecules with torsion . </S>"
