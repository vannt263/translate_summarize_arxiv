    "the main goal of this paper is to develop a general theory of flag bicolorings and the related concepts of coverings and pseudo - orientations .",
    "the idea of consistent colorings of the flags of a map with two colors has appeared previously in literature in different contexts .",
    "for instance , when the automorphism group of a map which is a polytope has two orbits on the flags , we may color the flags with two colors in such a way that flags in different orbits have different colors .",
    "these are called 2-orbit maps in @xcite , but this investigation requires the extra property that the maps be abstract .",
    "specific @xmath0-colorings of flags are equivalent to the concept of @xmath1-_compatible _ maps introduced in @xcite , where @xmath1 is a class of @xmath0-orbit maps .",
    "this concept , generalized to hypermaps is called @xmath1-_conservative _ in @xcite . in all these instances ,",
    "the colorings are used as a tool to work with automorphisms of maps .",
    "although some of the motivations behind the bicoloring of flags come from maps admitting symmetries , the ideas can be applied to general maps . in this work",
    "we shall not make assumptions on the automorphism groups of the maps in consideration .",
    "maps admitting a bicoloring of flags in which adjacent flags have different colors are precisely maps on orientable surfaces ( see proposition [ oble012 ] ) .",
    "although the other types of bicolorings of flags that we consider in this paper do not have a known topological equivalence , some results on orientability do translate directly to analogous results on bicolorability . in this sense",
    "we may think of bicolorings of flags as a generalization of orientability of maps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections [ sec : maps ] , [ sec : ori ] , [ sec : col ] introduce the concepts of maps , pseudo - orientations and bicolorings , respectively . a relationship between pseudo - orientability and bicolorings",
    "is provided in section [ sec : colori ] .",
    "section [ sec : op ] explores the impact on bicolorability of operations on maps . in section [ sec : doubles ] , we discuss a natural double cover of every map which is not bicolorable .",
    "the set of bicolorings of any map can be given a natural group structure . in section",
    "[ sec : everygroup ] we determine , for each possible group , which surfaces admit maps with the given group of bicolorings .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : mpx ] , we generalize some of the results about maps to higher dimensional structures .",
    "a map @xmath2 is , first and foremost , an embedding of a graph ( or pseudograph ) on a ( compact , connected ) surface so that the components of the complement of the embedding ( called _ faces _ ) are topologically open disks .",
    "we can , for example , regard the cube as an embedding of the graph @xmath3 on the sphere .",
    "the graph @xmath3 is an example of a graph which is _ bipartite _ ,",
    "i.e. , its vertices can be colored with two colors so that every edge joins vertices of opposite colors . when speaking about maps , we will use the term _ vertex - bipartite _ to describe a map @xmath2 whose underlying graph is bipartite .",
    "similarly , we will call @xmath2 _ face - bipartite _ provided its faces can be colored with two colors so that each edge separates faces of opposite colors .",
    "we will call @xmath2 _ edge - bipartite _ provided that the edges can be colored with two colors so that edges which are consecutive around a face ( and hence around a vertex ) have different colors .    to look more closely at the structure of a map , we find the following subdivision useful : choose a point in the interior of each face to call its _ center _ and a point in the relative interior of each edge to be its _",
    "midpoint_. draw dotted lines to connect each face - center with each incidence with the surrounding vertices and edge - midpoints .",
    "the original edges and these dotted lines divide the surface into triangles called _ flags_. figure [ fig : cubeflags ] shows the subdivision of the cube into flags .        if a face meets a vertex ( or an edge ) more than once , we emphasize that the face center is connected to each incidence  each appearance  of the vertex or midpoint .",
    "for instance , consider the map @xmath4 shown in the left of figure [ fig : m4 ] .",
    "this map has only one face , an octagon , four edges and only one vertex .",
    "nonetheless , the dissection into flags draws 16 dotted lines , dividing the octagon , and the map , into 16 flags , as shown on the right .    ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",height=113 ] , title=\"fig:\",height=113 ]    each flag corresponds to a mutual incidence of face , edge , and vertex , though different flags may correspond to the same triple .",
    "let @xmath5 be the set of flags .",
    "then let @xmath6 be the permutations on @xmath5 which match each flag @xmath7 with its three immediate neighbors , as in figure [ fig : flags ] .        in that figure",
    ", we see that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are adjacent along a face - center - to - edge - midpoint line .",
    "thus @xmath7 and @xmath9 differ only in their incidences to a vertex , a 0-dimensional face of @xmath2 . similarly , @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath10 differ only in their incidences to an edge , a 1-dimensional face , while @xmath7 and @xmath11 differ only in their incidences to a 2-dimensional face .",
    "notice from figure [ fig : flags ] that the flag @xmath12-adjacent to @xmath8 is also @xmath13-adjacent to @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , as permutations on @xmath15 and @xmath12 commute .    we can take a slightly more abstract point of view by defining a map to be a pair @xmath16)$ ] where @xmath5 is a set of things called _ flags _ , the @xmath17 s and @xmath18 are fixed point free permutations of order 2 on @xmath5 , the _ connection group _",
    "@xmath19 is transitive on @xmath5 , and @xmath13 and @xmath12 commute .",
    "this @xmath20 is often called the _ monodromy group _ of the map .",
    "we can then think of vertices in @xmath2 as orbits of @xmath21 in @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , edges correspond to orbits of @xmath22 and faces to orbits of @xmath23 .",
    "we will use the word _",
    "kite _ or _",
    "corner _ for the area within a face where two consecutive edges meet .",
    "more formally , a kite is the union of two flags which are @xmath24-adjacent .    if @xmath2 and @xmath25 are maps on surfaces @xmath26 and @xmath27 , a _ projection _ from @xmath25 to @xmath2 is a function @xmath28 mapping @xmath27 to @xmath26 which is locally a homeomorphism at all points of @xmath25 except perhaps at vertices and/or face - centers , and which sends faces to faces , edges to edges , and vertices to vertices .    in combinatorial terms , if @xmath29)$ ] and @xmath30)$ ] , a projection of @xmath25 to @xmath2 is a function @xmath28 mapping @xmath31 to @xmath5 such that @xmath32 for all @xmath33 .",
    "we call such an @xmath25 a _ cover _ of @xmath2 . notice that if @xmath25 is a cover of @xmath2 , and the pre - image of some one flag in @xmath2 has size @xmath0 , then the projection @xmath28 is @xmath0-to-1 onto every flag of @xmath2 .",
    "we say then that @xmath25 is a _",
    "@xmath0-fold _ cover of @xmath2 .",
    "we call a map _ orientable _ provided that the surface on which it is embedded is itself orientable .",
    "we check that a map is orientable by giving it a _ face orientation _ ; this is an assignment of a circular arrow to each face of @xmath2 such that at every edge , the arrows on the faces joined by the edge point along the edge in _ opposite _ directions , as in figure [ fig : faceori ] .",
    "we can define a _",
    "vertex orientation _",
    "similarly , and it is clear that @xmath2 has a vertex - orientation if and only if it has a face - orientation , and this happens if and only if @xmath2 is orientable .        the word _",
    "pseudo - orientation _ has been used in two different ways .",
    "we will use the term _ vertex pseudo - orientation _ ( vpso for short ) for what is called in @xcite simply a pseudo - orientation . here , we mean an assignment of one circular arrow to each vertex so that at each edge the two arrows cross in the _ same _ direction , as in figure [ fig : pso ] .",
    "if we visualize a gear wheel at each vertex so that cogs on the wheels of adjacent vertices mesh , the map is vpso if we can turn one wheel , causing all wheels to turn at the same time .    in @xcite ,",
    "the idea is used to make an important distinction about @xmath0-fold rotary covers of a rotary map @xmath2 for which the branching is totally ramified at vertices . if @xmath2 is non - orientable , @xmath0 can be larger than 2 only if @xmath2 is vertex pseudo - orientable .",
    "similarly , a _",
    "face pseudo - orientation _ ( or fpso ) is an assignment of one circular arrow to each face , as in figure [ fig : pso ] , so that at each edge , the arrows in adjacent faces flow along the edge in the _ same _ direction",
    ". we can simplify this by orienting each edge so that the cycle of edges around each face is consistently oriented .    in @xcite this",
    "is called a pseudo - orientation , and the result in that paper is that the _ dart graph _ of @xmath2 is connected if and only if @xmath2 is not face pseudo - orientable .",
    "finally , we may define an _ edge pseudo - orientation _ ( or epso ) to be an orientation of the edges such that in every face the direction of the arrows in adjacent edges flows in the _ same _ direction ( either into or out of the face ) as in figure [ fig : pso ] .",
    "in this paper , the word ` coloring ' will be used to describe what might be more fully notated as a ` consistent flag 2-coloring ' .",
    "if @xmath34 is any subset of @xmath35 , then an @xmath34-coloring of a map @xmath2 is a function @xmath36 such that for every flag @xmath7 , if @xmath37 , then @xmath38 , while if @xmath39 , then @xmath40 . to say that in another way ,    @xmath41 figure [ fig : cubecols ] shows a @xmath42-coloring , a @xmath43-coloring , and an @xmath44-coloring of the cube .",
    "the reader should check that the colorings extend unambiguously to the unseen faces of the cube as well .",
    "let us first notice that if @xmath45 is an @xmath34-coloring of @xmath2 , then so is @xmath46 , and these are , in fact , the only @xmath34-colorings of the map",
    ".    give the name _ sub - edge _ to the segments forming sides of the flags .",
    "these are of three types :    type 0 : :    : midpoint - of - edge to face - center , type 1 : :    : face - center to vertex , type 2 : :    : vertex to midpoint - of - edge .",
    "each flag @xmath7 is adjacent to flag @xmath47 along their mutual sub - edges of type @xmath48 . if @xmath2 is @xmath34-colorable , therefore , the sub - edges bounding each color are the sub - edges of types in @xmath34 .    note that when considering maps in class @xmath49 as defined in @xcite , the subset @xmath34 is used to indicate that @xmath48-adjacent flags belong to the _ same _ orbit",
    "this means that maps in class @xmath49 admit an @xmath50-coloring . in the context of colorings",
    "it turns out to be more practical to define @xmath34-coloring requiring @xmath48-adjacent flags to be a different color rather than requiring @xmath48-adjacent flags to be the same color if and only if @xmath51 .",

    "however , the map @xmath120 can be constructed even if @xmath2 is not @xmath34-colorable .",

    "then @xmath2 is @xmath34-pseudo - orientable if and only if @xmath2 is @xmath123-colorable .",
    "proof : first , recall that the sub - edges of @xmath2 are of three different types :    type 0 : :    : midpoint - of - edge to face - center , type 1 : :    : face - center to vertex , type 2 : :    : vertex to midpoint - of - edge .",
    "furthermore , let us think of the sub - edges as directed .",

    "we delete or ignore sub - edges of each type @xmath124 , so we only consider sub - edges of type in @xmath34 .",

    "now give every sub - edge with color 0 the standard orientation , and each sub - edge with color 1 the non - standard direction .",
    "if @xmath34 has 2 elements , then consecutive sub - edges around a face of @xmath69 of different types are the same color , while those of the same type are opposite colors .",
    "this causes the directions to be consistent about a face . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath34 has only one element , then the sub - edges around a face of @xmath69 alternate in color and are all of the same type ; again , this forces the orientation to be consistent .",
    "the following examples show how this works :    1 .   if @xmath125 , then by definition the map is @xmath34-pseudo - orientable if and only if it is orientable , and this happens if and only if it is @xmath44-colorable .",
    "2 .   if @xmath126 , then @xmath127 , which is face pseudo - orientable if and only if it is @xmath115-colorable . in this case , we orient black type 2 sub - edges from vertex to midpoint - of - edge but white type 2 sub - edges from midpoint - of - edge to vertex .",

    "make these the vertices of a graph , and join two of them by an edge is some flag of one is @xmath17 adjacent to some flag of the other .",
    "if this graph is bipartite , we say that @xmath2 is @xmath48-face bipartite .",
    "then , it is easy to show then that @xmath2 is @xmath48-face bipartite if an only if it is @xmath297-colorable .",
    "we can define connected sum of two @xmath274-maniplexes , removing isomorphic facets , one from each maniplex and adjusting the @xmath298 connections to form the sum .",
    "the theorem that the sum has any coloring common to both still holds .",
    "the operators generalize with a little care .",
    "we form @xmath299 from @xmath2 by replacing @xmath12 with the product @xmath300 .",
    "we form @xmath301 from @xmath2 by reversing the order of the generators .",
    "and then @xmath302 .",
    "similar facts hold about how colorings of @xmath2 are inherited by its direct derivates .",
    "the medial operation is more difficult to generalize .",
    "the construction of @xmath34-doubles is straightforward to generalize , and all of the facts about the doubles do as well .",
    "the fact that maps have rank 3 plays no role in any of these proofs .",
    "again , because there is no notion equivalent to that of ` surface ' , there is no natural way to generalize the results of section [ sec : everygroup ] .",
    "the constructions in section [ sec : everygroup ] lead to quite general maps , although some of them may be somewhat degenerate in the viewpoint of other previous work",
    ". it may be the case that more exceptions in theorem [ allgp ] are needed if we ask the extra requirement that the maps are polyhedral maps ( that is , the intersection of the closure of two distinct faces is either empty , a single vertex , or a single edge .",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of this paper .    in previous sections we considered colorings of the flags of maps insisting that we use only two colors . in doing so ,",
    "we ensure that if a given flag is @xmath48-adjacent to another flag with the same color then all flags are the same color as their @xmath48-adjacent flags .",
    "consistent colorings with @xmath0 colors can be defined following the idea of @xcite and @xcite , that is , each flag is assigned a color in @xmath303 with the restriction that for every @xmath304 and @xmath305 , the color of the @xmath48-adjacent flag to a flag @xmath7 colored @xmath291 depends on @xmath291 but not on @xmath7 .    when @xmath0-coloring a map consistently for @xmath306 then it may not be true that a flag is @xmath48-adjacent to another flag with the same color if and only if each flag is @xmath48-adjacent to another flag with the same color .",
    "for example , we can color the flags of the pentagons of a pentagonal prism with color @xmath307 , the flags of the edges shared by two squares with color @xmath308 , and the remaining flags with color @xmath309 , as in figure [ fig:3orb ] .",
    "the reader can easily verify that this is a consistent 3-coloring , however , flags colored @xmath307 are @xmath307-adjacent to flags colored @xmath307 , and flags colored @xmath308 are @xmath307-adjacent to flags colored @xmath309 .",
    "it is unlikely that the concept of pseudo - orientability admits a generalization that preserves the connections between 2-colorings and pseudo - orientations of maps .",
    "however , @xmath0-colorings may still keep an interesting relation with @xmath0-fold covers of maps and maniplexes as well .      *",
    "acknowledgements : * the authors , particularly the last , would like to thank the organizers of the workshop on abstract polytopes ( this set of organizers overlaps the set of authors ) for bringing us together . without that meeting",
