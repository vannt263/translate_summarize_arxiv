    "let @xmath0 be a 4-dimensional space with orthonormal tetrad @xmath1 .",
    "then a metric @xmath2 may be defined on @xmath0 by @xmath3 where @xmath4 . whereas einstein extended special relativity to general relativity by extending the group of transformations from the lorentz group to the group of diffeomorphisms ,",
    "einstein later suggested that that a unified field theory may be obtained by extending the diffeomorphisms to a larger group [ 1 ] .",
    "einstein was also led by the principle that the speed of light was constant .",
    "consistent with einstein s approach , we look for the largest group of transformations for which the wave equation , @xmath5 , is covariant .",
    "this is the guiding principle for our theory .",
    "let @xmath6 be a vector density of weight @xmath7 .",
    "then a conservation law of the form @xmath8 is invariant under all transformations satisfying @xmath9 this property defines the group of conservative transformations , of which , the group of diffeomorphisms is a proper subgroup [ 2 ] .",
    "since the wave equation may be written as @xmath10 with @xmath11 , we see that the conservation group is `` the largest group of coordinate transformations under which the equation for the propagation of light is covariant '' [ 3 ] .",
    "although we may view the space @xmath0 as a riemannian manifold , the space is more general than a manifold [ 2 - 6 ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath12 are coordinates on a riemannian manifold @xmath13 .",
    "then for functions @xmath14 with continuous second derivatives , the commutator of partial derivatives is zero , i.e. , @xmath15f=0 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath16 is non - diffeomorphic but satisfies ( 1 ) we see that @xmath17f$ ] is nonzero .",
    "thus the geometry associated with the group of conservative transformations is more general than a manifold .",
    "it is not simply an abandonment of the diffeomorphism condition that @xmath18 = 0 $ ] , however , because we require that the transformation be conservative .",
    "the argument that accelerated observers should be on equal footing led einstein to general relativity .",
    "we have argued that requiring that quantum observers be on equal footing leads to the conservation group [ 3 ] .",
    "if we , as observers consider ourselves to be classical ( non - quantum ) observers , we will have a preference for the manifold view for what we observe . in truth",
    ", we are are quantum observers and hence some `` fuzziness '' in our observations as well as the observations of other observers is present .",
    "suppose @xmath19 are used as coordinates on a neighborhood of our manifold .",
    "if @xmath20 is non - diffeomorphic but satisfies ( 1 ) , then @xmath21 is similar to anholonomic coordinates [ 7 ] .",
    "however , the conservative group property ( 1 ) ensures that observers , one using @xmath19 and the other using @xmath21 as their coordinates , are on equal footing .",
    "when we take the manifold view , we interpret the change of coordinates from @xmath19 to @xmath21 as only making sense at the differential ( i.e. infinitesimal ) level .",
    "thus , we see the neighborhoods upon which the coordinate systems of the second observer make sense to us as the first observer have shrunk from global ( special relativity ) to local ( general relativity ) to infinitesimal ( conservation group theory ) .",
    "we stipulate that we may begin the setup of our theory as if it were a manifold , defining @xmath22 as a function of @xmath12 . on equal footing",
    "there are many coordinate systems related to @xmath12 via conservative transformations , however we , as observers , have a natural preference for the manifold view and hence prefer @xmath12 .    in an effort to model dark matter cosmic acceleration , many theorists have simply modified general relativity in some fashion .",
    "we claim that our modification which is based on an enlargement of the transformation group is perhaps the only one with a solid guiding principle .",
    "einstein himself felt it was a mistake to simply add a cosmological constant @xmath23 .",
    "recently , theoretical developments of @xmath24 gravity [ 8 ] , quintessence [ 9 ] and other modifications of general relativity [ 10 ] have a similar _ ad hoc _ flavor .",
    "the geometrical content of the theory based on the conservation group is determined by @xmath25 , where the ricci rotation coefficient is given by @xmath26 [ 2 - 6 ] .",
    "pandres calls this the curvature vector .",
    "he shows that @xmath27 is invariant under transformations from @xmath12 to @xmath28 if and only if the transformation is conservative and thus satisfies ( 1 ) .",
    "a suitable scalar lagrangian for the free field is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the determinant of the tetrad .",
    "using @xmath31 , we have extended the field variables [ 5 ] to include the tetrad @xmath32 and 4 internal vectors @xmath33 , with internal space variable @xmath34 . with this extension ,",
    "the covariant derivative has been extended to be invariant under a larger group of transformations on @xmath34 as well as @xmath35 [ 5 ] .",
    "we assume that the metric on the @xmath34 space is also @xmath36 .",
    "the definition of the ricci rotation coefficient is also extended using the @xmath33 to @xmath37 and the definition of @xmath27 is also extended to @xmath38 . using these extended ricci rotation coefficients , one finds that @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the usual ricci scalar curvature .",
    "thus , when the physical space is interpreted as a manifold , the lagrangian density of the free field contains terms corresponding to non - gravitational interactions [ 4,6 ] .",
    "the motion of a free particle or photon in the inertial coordinate system is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "this equation when transformed to internal coordinates , @xmath34 is @xmath43 where the right hand side of this equation is zero when there are no internal forces . since @xmath44 corresponds to the flat metric",
    ", we naturally interpret the right hand side of ( 6 ) as a force .",
    "the @xmath33 are thus internal fields that via @xmath45 correspond to electroweak and strong interactions . in the manifold view , with coordinates @xmath19 equation ( 6 ) becomes @xmath46 the right hand is partly generated from the internal forces since from ( 3 ) one sees that this equation of motion depends on @xmath47 .",
    "setting the variations of @xmath48 with respect to @xmath49 and @xmath33 equal to zero along with the assumption that we may always choose @xmath33 to correspond to a complex lorentz transformation ( since @xmath50 ) , yields the field equations @xmath51    one feature of the extended theory with field variables @xmath32 and @xmath33 is that the internal fields associated with @xmath33 may be specified after finding a tetrad @xmath52 which satisfies the condition @xmath53 .",
    "if this tetrad is a function of position , then @xmath52 yields a riemannian manifold ( manifold view ) with corresponding metric , @xmath54 . changes in @xmath33 have no effect on this manifold [ 5 ] . if @xmath33 is a constant field such that @xmath55 , then the field equations are satisfied , however @xmath33 may be non - constant . there exist nonconstant ( non - diffeomorphic ) values of @xmath33 that satisfy the conservative condition , @xmath56 . with @xmath33 that satisfy this condition , the field equations , @xmath57 remain satisfied .",

    "thus we use a symmetrized expression to ensure this .",
    "define for general @xmath62 , the symmetrized tensor by @xmath63 . using ( 8) we see that the field equations may be also expressed in the form @xmath64 with free field stress energy tensor @xmath65 .",
    "the terms of @xmath65 suggest that , when interpreted in riemannian geometry , this new geometry produces a stress energy tensor with additional terms that could be the stress energy tensor for dark matter or dark energy [ 6 ] .    in the presence of sources",
    "the lagrangian is of the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the appropriate lagrangian density function for the source . in this case",

    "the energy in this halo is a direct consequence of the mass @xmath216 .",
    "this likely corresponds to dark matter .",

    "independent of the nature of the mass @xmath216 ( whether it is a sun , a planet or a sphere of ice ) this halo has the same form which depends only on the value of @xmath216 .",
    "although the stress - energy tensor does not correspond to a perfect fluid , the pressure gradients prevent fluid elements from moving inward or outward . using @xmath155 , with @xmath218 one easily finds from ( 29 ) that @xmath219 the left - hand side of this equation corresponds to the outward force due to the pressure of the `` fluid . ''",
    "we see from ( 57 ) that the outward force due to pressures equals the inward force due to the gravitational force . from ( 49 ) , we see that asymptotically @xmath220 and thus asymptotically @xmath221      if the density outside ( for @xmath198 r ) is small but nonzero , a realistic function that agrees with the weak field solution must have the property , @xmath222 . thus noncompact solutions may be constructed that realistically model the exterior of a star or the distribution of matter in a star cluster .",
    "one particularly simple model is given by @xmath223 with this choice , @xmath224 .",

    "equation ( 58 ) is also correct for this noncompact solution .",

    "we now investigate the motion of a test particle in the external field solution .",
    "an efficient procedure for doing this is one that extremalizes an appropriate lagrangian .",
    "we follow de felice and clarke [ 14 ] with a lagrangian for a particle in a field with non - zero stress energy tensor .",
    "specifically , we use the lagrangian ( 10 ) with the source term given by @xmath227 where @xmath228 approximates the dirac delta function with a space - like volume of @xmath229 which yields the usual dirac delta function in the limit as @xmath230 .",

    "the @xmath76 component requires some careful interpretation .",
    "we will assume the the particle is small in the sense that the curvature of space does not change appreciably over the space - like regions associated with its motion .",
    "we will also assume that the particle has spherical symmetry .",
    "thus there is an external field associated with the particle that is carried along with it ( halo ) .",
    "it seems reasonable that the pressures in this particle halo , similar to those of equations ( 55 ) or ( 61 ) , will have very little effect on the motion of the particle .",
    "the density of the particle s halo will be incorporated into the calculation of the mass @xmath60 of the particle . if the density of the particle is identical to the density determined by @xmath260 , i.e. equal to @xmath261 , ( i.e. identical to the density of the fluid elements of the halo associated with the mass @xmath216 ) then the net force on the particle would be zero .",
    "however , we find that when the density differs from the fluid element density , then the @xmath262 term has a nonzero contribution . as is usual for the perfect fluid type stress - energy tensor , the components of @xmath262 are in units of force per unit volume .",
    "we find that the gravitational action on the particle is accounted for in the @xmath263 term of ( 63 ) .",
    "thus , the corresponding term of @xmath262 should be omitted .",
    "( recall that @xmath229 represents the volume of the particle . )",
    "this implies that there is an additional outward force , @xmath264 , from the radial and tangential pressures , since @xmath265 i.e. @xmath266    the @xmath76 component of ( 63 ) ( when @xmath238)after multiplying by @xmath267 is given by @xmath268 using ( 66 ) and ( 68 ) we find that @xmath269 we now impose a normalization on the velocity @xmath270 : @xmath271 .",
