    "one of the most active areas of condensed matter theory is the development of new algorithms to simulate and predict the behavior of materials exhibiting strong correlations .",
    "recent developments of the powerful many - body approach , the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite and its cluster extensions @xcite , hold a great promise in being able to accurately predict physical properties of this challenging class of materials . in recent years , the dmft method has substantially advanced our understanding of the physics of the mott transition and demonstrated its power to explain such problems as the structural phase diagrams of actinides @xcite , phonon response @xcite , optical conductivity @xcite , valence and x - ray absorption @xcite and transport @xcite of some of the archetype materials with strong correlations .",
    "the success of the dynamical mean field theory in the context of the electronic structure revitalized the search for fast and flexible impurity solvers which could treat hund s coupling and spin - orbit coupling of the parent atomic constituents in the crystal environment of the lattice .",
    "further , the newly developed cluster extensions of dmft @xcite require faster impurity solver which could access low temperature strong correlation limit .",
    "many impurity solvers were developed over the last few decades , including hirsh - fye quanum monte carlo method @xcite , exact diagonalization @xcite , non - crossing approximation @xcite , and its extensions like one - crossing approximation @xcite or sunca @xcite , iterative perturbation theory @xcite , wilson s numerical renormalization group @xcite expansion around the atomic limit @xcite , and many others .",
    "each method has some advantages and disadvantages , but at the present time , there is no method that works efficiently and produces accurate solutions for the green s function in all regimes of parameters . concentrating only on the most often employed method , numerically exact hirsch - fye quanum monte carlo ,",
    "the following weaknesses limit its usefulness in many realistic materials and clusters of strongly correlated models : i ) it can not treat realistic multiplet structure which is very important in strongly correlated @xmath0 materials .",
    "ii ) the discretization of the imaginary time leads to considerable systematic error @xcite and requires extrapolation to infinitesimally small time slices .",
    "iii ) the low temperatures regime in the strong correlation limit of large @xmath1 is computationally very expensive since it requires many time slices and infinite @xmath1 models like t - j model are unaccessible .",
    "all of the above mentioned shortcomings of the conventional quantum monte carlo algorithm are eliminated by the novel continuous time quantum monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "in addition , the new method is even much faster for most of applications we tested , including cluster dmft for the hubbard model and application of lda+dmft to the actinides .",
    "the basic idea and its implementation for the hubbard model was recently published in ref .  .",

    "we want to describe the powerful new implementation of the method for applications to realistic materials with complicated multiplet structure , including all interaction terms : hubbard @xmath1 , hund s coupling and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the extension to clusters of few sites and superconducting state within cluster dmft will be addressed and its power will be demonstrated by studying the low temperature coherence of both the hubbard and the t - j model . the kondo volume collapse transition in elemental cerium will be reexamined showing the valence histogram of the alpha and gamma phase of the material .",

    "two expansions were recently implemented : the expansion around the band limit @xcite and the expansion in the hybridization strength @xcite .",
    "the later seems to be superior in the strongly correlated regime due to substantial reduction of the size of matrices that need to be manipulated @xcite and , most importantly , the empirical finding is that the minus sign problem in this approach is severely reduced or maybe even eliminated @xcite .",

    "all these approximations can be viewed as partial summation of the same type of diagrams . with stochastic sampling ,",
    "the summation of essentially all the diagrams is now possible .",
