    "we define a _ sociotechnical system _ as one involving interactions between _ autonomous _ social entities such as people and organizations mediated by technical components . by emphasizing the autonomous nature of social entities ,",
    "our definition generalizes over , yet more precisely captures , the traditional connotation of the interaction between humans and societal infrastructure .",
    "our definition contrasts with one of the conventional uses of the term , which covers any interaction between people and computers .",
    "researchers in software engineering ( se ) picked up the theme of sociotechnical systems in two major directions : ( 1 ) how to model a sociotechnical system as a combination of social and software components , as in @xcite ; and ( 2 ) how to elicit , model , and manage the requirements of the social components so that suitable software components may be designed @xcite .",
    "often , there is substantial overlap between the two directions , for example , as in i * @xcite .",
    "baxter and sommerville conceptualize a sociotechnical system as one that _ actively pursues goals _ in an organizational setting ; that is , a sociotechnical system is one actor : a single locus of control",
    ". therefore , we refer to such systems as being _ conceptually centralized_. the centralized conception is shared by current se approaches .    for clarity ,",
    "we reserve the term _ principal _ to refer to an autonomous social party who participates in a system at runtime and the term _ stakeholder _ to refer to one who originates some of the requirements . in general , any principal would also be a stakeholder in the system ( suitably abstracted via the notion of _ roles _ ) .",
    "we restrict our attention to systems whose membership and structure can change dynamically .",
    "open _ sociotechnical systems are properly viewed as _",
    "societies _ of principals : we can not build a `` complete '' system but can only specify how its members may _ interact _ , leaving as out of our scope the engineering of the members themselves .",
    "thus whether the members _ comply _ with the specified interactions is crucial . because of its emphasis on interaction , we term our approach interaction - oriented software engineering or _",
    "iose_. we claim that iose is necessary and show that the centralized conception is not applicable in sociotechnical systems .",
    "common settings such as business services and social computing realize open sociotechnical systems .",
    "consider schield et al.s description of a healthcare system in the united states , including its key stakeholders and their ( presumed ) objectives .",
    "* us society : the collective public , private , and personal interests of the united states citizens .",
    "* regulatory bodies : public and private that make and enforce policies . * mco : managed care organizations ( i.e. , licensed insurance organizations ) , who offer and administer managed care plans .",
    "* institutional providers : hospitals and laboratories .",
    "* clinical or professional providers : individual doctors and communities of practice .",
    "* employers : fully insured and self - funded organizations who offer managed care plans to their employees . * consumers : the enrollees of managed care plans . * medicaid or medicare beneficiaries .",
    "schield et al .",
    "find that the stakeholders objectives often conflict .",
    "for example , payers must keep costs down whereas providers must maximize revenue ; insurers want to shift risk to providers and consumers for matters of cost control whereas both providers and consumers want protection from potentially catastrophic costs .",
    "consumers want shorter waiting periods for appointments with their physicians whereas physicians want to increase their panel of patients .",
    "further , schield et al .",
    "point out how one principal can , in pursuing its own objectives , compromise the objectives of others . for example , making a patient wait longer may compromise the patient s health , thereby increasing the cost of care and decreasing patient satisfaction .",
    "regulatory bodies have the objective of making sure mcos and providers play by the rules and ensuring that cost , quality , and access criteria are met but that conflicts with society s goals of lower - cost healthcare .",
    "assume that the stakeholders for a healthcare system manage to resolve their differences and specify a system that meets their stated collective requirements .",
    "now , individual _ principals _ such as specific mcos , hospitals , physicians , employees , and consumers can join or leave the managed healthcare system of their own volition .",
    "the principals act according to their own private business policies , some of which may not have been envisaged by the stakeholders .",
    "for example , an mco may have a private objective to acquire an independent call center .",
    "further , principals would generally employ their own internal information systems to support their interactions with other principals .",
    "for example , providers may set up appointment systems to handle appointment - related communications with consumers .",
    "hospitals and mcos may use complex information systems that help process payments from each other and the consumers .",
    "mcos may employ complex actuarial and decision - support processes in handling claims .",
    "recognizing and addressing conflicts among stakeholders requirements has been a longstanding area of research in software engineering .",
    "once the conflicts are addressed , through whichever means , engineers would seek to model and realize a system that meets those requirements .",
    "this paper treats conflict analysis as out of scope and instead focuses on identifying modeling assumptions and criteria that capture sociotechnical systems more faithfully .",
    "this paper makes two main contributions .",
    "first , it shows via conceptual analysis why iose is ( 1 ) a novel paradigm and ( 2 ) well - suited for the software engineering of open sociotechnical systems .",
    "our argument proceeds as follows .",
    "one , we show that the foundational models of traditional se are conceptually centralized .",
    "this is because traditional se concerns itself with the engineering of what is conceptually a single machine ( section  [ sec : machine - orientation ] ) .",
    "two , we present the conceptual model of a system in iose ( section  [ sec : iose ] ) and discuss how it accommodates multiple perspectives .",
    "three , based on the characteristics of sociotechnical systems , namely , autonomy , accountability , and loose coupling , we formulate criteria that any se approach for them should meet and show that whereas machine - orientation , and therefore traditional se , fails the criteria , iose meets them ( section  [ sec : eval - machine - iose ] ) .",
    "the second contribution of this paper lies in reinterpreting the broad se principles of modularity , encapsulation , abstraction , and the separation of concerns in accordance with the above criteria ( section  [ sec : principles - iose ] ) .",
    "the reinterpretation provides the elements of a methodology for iose .",
    "further , we discuss in detail well - known software methodologies that are motivated either by sociotechnical systems or the modeling of interactions among principals and show how they violate one or more of these principles ( section  [ sec : prominent - approaches ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : literature ] discusses additional literature that is relevant to iose .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] concludes the paper with pointers to future directions .",
    "figure  [ fig : re - conceptual - model ] ( from van lamsweerde ) shows the traditional conceptual model for se .",
    "the _ system as is _ represents the system with identified problems , inefficiencies , and limitations .",
    "the _ system to be _ , whose _ objectives _ are to avoid those deficiencies , is to be engineered .",
    "the idea is to understand the problem domain in order to come up with a set of _ services _ , _ constraints _ , and _ assumptions",
    "_ under which the stated objectives would be met",
    ". some of these would be met by the _ software to be _ as part of the system to be ; the rest would be assigned as responsibilities to components in the _ environment _ , namely , _ people _ , _ devices _ , and _",

    "the _ system as is _ is the system as it exists without the machine and helps us understand the environment in which the machine will be introduced .",
    "the system to be is what the system will be when the machine is introduced .",
    "if all goes well in the system to be , the stakeholders requirements are satisfied .",
    "it is important to understand the nature of the machine .",
    "figure  [ fig : machine - environment ] ( from @xcite but based on @xcite ) illustrates an operational conceptualization of the machine - environment interface . here , the _ software to be _ represents the machine .",
    "a machine is a _ controller _ that maps inputs from its environment ( by monitoring certain variables ) to outputs or effects in the environment ( by setting certain variables ) . in other words , it processes inputs to produce outputs . to its users ( in the environment ) ,",
    "a machine provides computational services ( functionality ) .    in its very conception",
    ", a machine corresponds to a single locus of control .",
    "indeed , it is common in software engineering to talk of machines as acting in pursuit of goals @xcite .",
    "traditional se is machine - oriented  it concerns itself with the specification of a machine ( even if implemented via distributed components ) that would meet stakeholder requirements .",
    "thus traditional se reflects a _ conceptually centralized _ perspective , namely , of the stakeholders , considered collectively .",

    "machine - orientation manifests itself in specific modeling notations and methodologies , some of which have been highly influential in se .",
    "many existing requirements - based approaches , although differing in their details , instantiate the same concepts at their core : machine , environment , system as is , and system to be .",
    "tropos @xcite and i * @xcite refer to a model of the system as is and the system to be as the early and late requirements models , respectively . in their terminology ,",
    "the environment is a set of _ actors _ ; the machine itself is the _ system actor_. for example , tropos would create a system actor for an entire healthcare system .",
    "this actor would capture ( a consistent subset of ) the goals of all stakeholders , thereby functioning as a logically centralized machine .",
    "following kaos @xcite , one would create a set of _ agents _ with designer - assigned individual goals .",
    "however , the set of agents is conceptually a single machine because there is a single locus of design .",
    "this follows from the fact that goals are assigned to agents and , therefore , at a high - level the agents have already been specified . indeed , referring specifically to kaos ( and to feather s work , which provides the conceptual basis for kaos ) , zave and jackson observe that even though kaos supports multiple agents , it is only a refinement of their more basic single - machine framework .",
    "let us apply the above conceptual model of systems to the healthcare scenario .",
    "imagine that a healthcare machine were built to a specified set of stakeholder requirements .",
    "the machine would control various medical devices and other equipment .",
    "users such as consumers , providers , mcos , and so via on would interface with the machine via a web interface .",
    "consider the example of scheduling an appointment with a physician .",
    "the physician would have configured his or her preferences in the machine : his or her daily schedule , how long a time period to allot each patient , and so on .",
    "those are the physician s inputs to the machine , which the machine uses in scheduling patient appointments .",
    "the patient s interface would display the available slots and enable him or her to choose from among those slots .",
    "the machine records each selection , and produces as output a confirmation of the appointment , perhaps also by email .",
    "further , the machine grays out the slot for future scheduling .",
    "the machine additionally supports the processing of claims and payments among hospitals and insurers . the machine would encode the insurance company s process of queuing claims above $ 10,000 separately for detailed examination .",
    "the insurance company through its interface can obtain the claims from the appropriate queues .",
    "the machine would implement the appropriate access control so that users can access the appropriate functionality .",
    "traditional se , in spite of its conceptually centralized perspective , may be applied to yield a physically distributed machine .",
    "web applications suggest physical distribution and applying kaos would result in a physically distributed set of agents . in general , techniques from software architecture",
    "may be applied to internally decompose a machine into distributed components .",
    "rapanotti et al .",
    "employ such an approach in the decomposition of machines in the problem frames approach .",
    "we define a _ protocol _ of a sociotechnical system as a specification of how interactions among its roles would proceed . in business settings , the protocol can take the form of a business contract that principals would enter into upon adopting different roles .",
    "for example , in texas , if medco wishes to play the role of mco , it must enter into a _",
    "uniform managed care _",
    "contract with the state health commission ( which alone plays the regulatory body role ) @xcite .    at any point during the interaction , the set of social expectations represents the _ social state _ of the system .",
    "a protocol serves three purposes .",
    "one , it makes public the social expectations of the participants while giving them the flexibility to follow their individual objectives .",
    "for example , public funding agencies may expect that mcos , upon notification , refund payments made in error within 30 days .",
    "two , it identifies which participant is accountable to which participant for what expectation . for instance , if medco , who plays mco , does not refund an erroneous payment in time , the funding agency may hold medco accountable .",
    "three , it frees participants to implement their information systems as they please as long as they satisfy the given protocol .",
    "for example , medco might employ any representation it chooses and may apply its policies in deciding whether to provide a refund early or late within the 30-day window .",

    "to be instantiated , principals adopt roles in the protocol .",
    "each principal continues to interact with its environment even after it joins the system .",
    "the principals communicate with each other within the scope of the system , which means that they are subject to the meanings defined in the protocol that specifies the system . in engineering terms , the main artifact produced by iose is the protocol which , through its roles , itself serves as a requirement for the principals who would adopt those roles .    whereas traditional se seeks to specify a machine , iose seeks to specify a protocol .",
    "whereas a machine captures a single locus of control , iose naturally supports multiple perspectives as roles in a protocol . in iose , each principal , who adopts one or more roles , is a locus of control  a reasoner and a sender and receiver of communications .",

    "the elementary operations on commitments are create , release , cancel , delegate , and assign .",
    "the social nature of commitments owes to the fact that they progress due to interactions among principals , not due to the internal reasoning of any principal .",
    "commitment protocols exploit this connection by specifying the meanings of _ messages _ in terms of how they affect commitments , thus enabling principals to interact flexibly .",

    "we represent this commitment as @xmath5 .",

    "let us use the healthcare example of section  [ sec : healthcare ] to motivate the key criteria that any software engineering methodology for sociotechnical systems must support .",
    "accommodate autonomy the autonomy of a principal ( a human , organization , or other social entity ) means that it is an independent locus of control with its own goals and policies , which reflect its business motivations and are normally private . thus even as a participant in a system , each principal is free in principle to act in pursuit of its own goals , without any consideration of others .",
    "for example , a hospital may decide not to entertain patients with a particular insurance provider , or physicians may increase the panel of patients they treat at the expense of reducing availability .",
    "figure  [ fig : old ] is compatible with autonomy only to the extent that it does not model social state .",
    "figure  [ fig : machine ] violates autonomy because the machine not only determines the definitive social state but also controls transitions on it .",
    "the principals have no direct relationship with each other .",
    "for example , a bid may be declined and a seller may not be able to change his mind and accept a bid lower than the reserve price .    contrast the above with protocols .",
    "a protocol is not a computationally active entity and can not provide a service .",
    "a protocol simply specifies the correctness criteria for interaction among the participants .",
    "figure  [ fig : iose ] expresses a protocol that specifies the appropriate social relationships among potential principals , capturing their legitimate expectations of each other .",
    "further , principals would enter into these relationships of their own volition ; no relationship is forced upon a principal , not even to ensure compliance .",
    "support accountability accountability is the flip side of autonomy .",
    "a participant is free to act as it pleases ; however , it is accountable to those that have legitimate social expectations of it .",
    "for example , a laboratory may legitimately expect that the mco transfer funds for services provided within a certain time after submission of claims .",
    "this means that the mco is accountable to the laboratory for transferring funds in time ; if it does not , it violates the laboratory s expectation .",
    "figure  [ fig : old ] provides no support for accountability because it does not represent the social state .",
    "figure  [ fig : machine ] holds each principal accountable to the central authority and , if it permits , to the other principals . for example , a buyer is accountable to ebay to pay in time .",
    "but if she persuades ebay to grant her an extension , the seller has no recourse within the ebay system .",
    "figure  [ fig : iose ] bases accountability on a protocol and thus each principal is accountable to any other principal in whom it has created a legitimate expectation . in particular , through the protocol , each principal ought to be able to judge the compliance with its expectations of each principal with whom it interacts .",
    "accommodate loose coupling loose coupling captures the idea that each principal is an independent locus of design .",
    "it has full control over the design of its own information systems but no control over the design of other principals information systems .",
    "for example , a hospital may store information about a surgeon s willingness to work the night shift whereas the insurance company may capture the total charges for procedures led by that surgeon . and , hospitals in different jurisdictions may capture different patient monitoring data during a surgery .",
    "figure  [ fig : old ] is compatible with loose coupling insofar as it elides the treatment of social state . in practice , it forces an ad hoc design of the interaction ( e.g. , message formats ) . because the message meanings are hidden , the principals who adapt their information systems risk failing interoperability .",
    "figure  [ fig : machine ] requires that the principals adopt the same representation of the social state as the machine .",
    "the meanings of the messages sent over the api could be explicit but they usually are hardcoded in the machine , and sometimes in the principals information systems , if any .",
    "this produces a tighter coupling than desirable between the principals and the machine ( both considered as endpoints ) : when the machine changes , the principals must potentially change their own behaviors and any information systems that support them accordingly .",
    "by contrast , figure  [ fig : iose ] employs a protocol with explicit meanings ( not hardcoded in any principals information system ) for the interactions .",

    "lacking an explicit meaning , each principal could interpret messages in incompatible ways .",
    "for example , in the healthcare setting , a laboratory may interpret the messages with the claim information as leading to an unconditional commitment from the mco to honor the claim .",
    "the mco , however , may interpret the commitment as being conditional on the claim being valid .",
    "such misalignments could have serious repercussions for the principals ( e.g. , in producing their balance sheets ) and may lead to legal disputes . if the principals negotiate the meanings of the messages and hard - code them in their information systems , they would produce hidden couplings among themselves : changes in how one principal handles messages would need to be propagated to the others .",
    "additionally , explicit social meaning promotes accountability because if the meanings are public , then principals can potentially check the compliance of themselves and others .",
    "solely social meaning a system specification must specify _ only _ the possible communications and their meanings and nothing else .",
    "further , the meaning must be expressed in terms of social abstractions such as commitments .",
    "specifications of any operational details that have significance at the social level ( e.g. , a convention to pay first ) , must be captured via social abstractions ( e.g. , commitments ) .",
    "specifications that capture ordering and occurrence constraints separately from the meaning violate this principle . for example , one could specify in the appointment scheduling protocol that availableslots follow requestappointment . but here no one is accountable for the constraint : is the physician at fault for not delaying sending availableslots or is the patient at fault for not sending requestappointment ? instead",
    ", if this constraint is necessary as a social requirement , one or more of the principals should commit to enforcing it , e.g. , adopting marengo et al.s approach and placing temporal constraints in commitments .",
    "further , specifying the technical infrastructure does not capture a sociotechnical system .",
    "we might either model the social actor who provides the infrastructure and engage it via commitments or omit such technical constraints altogether since they apply at a lower level of abstraction .",

    "it refers to the sorting out of the different threads from what would otherwise be a tangled mess . often , the invocation of this principle is implicit .",

    "interestingly , choreographies fit in the paradigm of figure  [ fig : old ] .",
    "principals adopting roles in a choreography would potentially maintain their own ledgers and interact via a digital messaging system that carries their messages to each other .",
    "however , there is no computational support for the social state : choreographies do not specify the social meanings of messages and as a result do not capture the social expectations interacting principals may have of each other .",
    "choreography description languages , e.g. , ws - cdl @xcite , support specifying the internal activities of principals in the choreography itself .",
    "for instance , the ws - cdl notion of _ workunits _ may be used to specify conditional actions by a principal . likewise , mendling and hafner use workunits to specify the internal compliance checks that a tax adviser would make in handling a client s annual statement ( p.  532 ) , thereby violating encapsulation .",

    "i * , tropos , and kaos are all machine - oriented since their primary specification artifact is that of a machine ( the system actor in i * and tropos and a collection of agents in kaos ) that would meet stakeholder requirements .",

    "in the foregoing , we have extensively discussed the literature most pertinent to our claims . here , we discuss other relevant literature .    commitments .",
    "commitments are recognized in the literature as a key social abstraction .",

    "iose , as a new paradigm for the sociotechnical systems , provides a natural home for commitments .",
    "agent - oriented software engineering despite the apparent similarity between the notion of agents and principals and talk of interaction in many aose methodologies , they ( as exemplified by gaia and tropos ) violate key iose principles . some aose approaches are logically centralized , e.g. , geared toward efficient problem - solving .",
    "gaia and other aose methodologies acknowledge the distinction between open and closed systems and emphasize interactions .",
    "they correctly classify problem solving systems that distribute a problem across agents as closed .",
    "however , aose methodologies betray , if not centralized mindsets , at least considerable conceptual difficulties .",
    "vsquez - salceda et al .",
    "model the objectives of social systems as goals and the systems as controllers ( p.  338 ) : `` facilitation roles are usually provided by agents controlled by the society , and follow a trivial contract . ''",

    "wagner s agent - object - relationship ( aor ) ontology proposes two kinds of models to support the design of a multiagent system : _ external _ ( observer s perspective , including interaction models ) and _ internal _ ( agent s perspective ) .",
    "newer work by guizzardi et al . is based on the aor ontology .",
    "wagner s internal - external distinction aligns well with iose .",
    "unfortunately , aor subverts the internal - external distinction by including in external models aspects of the internal organization of agents , such as their beliefs ( in _ agent diagrams _ ) as well as reactive rules that specify how an agent would respond to events .",

    "thus even though serrano and leite do nt involve an explicit system actor , the approach is conceptually centralized .",
    "how can we reconcile the facts that many aose methodologies are conceptually centralized yet model interactions ?",
    "aose methodologies yield physically distributed systems of agents that pursue centrally assigned goals .",
    "interactions in aose are focused on the technical means to achieve such goals whereas interactions in iose have social standing .",
    "information systems modeling mccarthy proposed rea as a generalized model for accounting that is based on _ resources _ , _ events _ , and _",
    "agents _ and relations among them .",
    "rea is finding applications in services and information systems modeling , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "rea seeks to capture the fundamental economic model underlying accounting .",
    "our endeavor is analogous : to develop a general model of sociotechnical systems , based on social abstractions .",
    "the key distinction between iose and rea is that rea models ultimately represent an organization s internal perspective , not its interactions with others .",
    "this is evident from rea s inside - outside distinction .",
    "one of rea s _ accountability _ relations identifies the responsible agent for an event _ inside _ an organization ; another is between an outside agent and an event .",
    "iose commitments are more general : each commitment identifies the accountable party and the party to whom it is accountable for what .",
    "the second distinction stems from the _ duality _ of events and the corresponding _ reciprocity _ of commitments  reflecting the roots of rea in accounting . duality in rea relates two events that together characterize the give - and - take of an economic exchange ( e.g. , and ) .",
    "these events _ execute _",
    "( i.e. , fulfill ) the corresponding reciprocal commitments .",
    "iose does not give any special place to either duality or reciprocity .",
    "no iose commitment is necessarily reciprocal : if @xmath1 is committed to @xmath2 , there is no requirement that @xmath2 be committed to @xmath1 ( though it is allowed ) .",
    "gordijn and akkermans propose the @xmath21-value ontology and associated methodology in order to specify and analyze so - called business models to evaluate their profitability for all stakeholders involved .",
    "a business model represents stakeholders as actors ( e.g. , customer ) .",
    "other important concepts are _ value objects _ ( e.g , online articles ) , and _ value exchanges _ among actors ( e.g. , with an article provider for articles and their payment ) .",
    "commitment protocols could be used to capture the notion of value exchange among actors ; further commitment protocols could be analyzed for feasibility @xcite . however , unlike commitment protocols and in violation of iose principles , @xmath21-value models also depict the internal flow of values in petri net - like notation .    human - computer interaction ( hci ) following developments in hci , the term `` social '' is often associated in re with the interplay between social factors and the design of technical artifacts ( as in the _ design of work _",
    ", e.g. , see @xcite ) , especially as concerns user interface and experience ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the iose treatment of `` social '' is more general and includes not just people but entities such as enterprises and organizations that may be conceptualized as social actors  which enables iose to tackle sociotechnical systems as we define them .",
    "compliance compliance with service - level agreements , regulations , and business contracts is gaining interest in software engineering .",
    "organizations are increasingly concerned with the question of compliance with regulatory frameworks such as hipaa @xcite and sarbanes - oxley .",
    "the challenges here are threefold : one , how to model regulations ; two , how to determine the compliance of a principal s behavior with regulations ; and , three , how to design a principal s information systems such that it is ( likely to be ) compliant with the regulations .",
    "siena et al .",
    "develop a tropos - inspired modeling language to capture and reason about such regulations .",
    "iose can potentially support a more flexible notion of compliance geared toward open systems .",
    "although high - level concepts such as obligations , permissions , and so on are often employed in software engineering , they are used to capture behavioral constraints abstractly but are not grounded in communication as commitments are .",
    "a more detailed discussion is out of the scope of this paper but interested readers are referred to @xcite for an in - depth discussion .",
    "our work began from the recognition that open sociotechnical systems are conceptually decentralized and their principals are autonomous social entities . specifying a sociotechnical",
    "system amounts to specifying a protocol , i.e. , a specification of the interactions among its potential participants .",
    "we showed that existing approaches take a fundamentally centralized view of sociotechnical systems design : they are geared toward the specification of a machine , not a protocol .",
    "we presented iose as a new approach for the engineering of sociotechnical systems .",
    "iose is driven by key technical demands : autonomy , accountability , and loose coupling . to illustrate iose , we introduced protocols in which the meanings of the messages are specified in terms of commitments as a natural way to address these technical demands .",
    "we formulated the iose principles inspired by , but distinct from , the traditional se principles .",
    "we undertook a detailed analysis of some leading relevant se approaches to show which iose principles they violate .",
    "traditional se falls short not because the abstractions it employs are low level , but because they deemphasize interaction . to support this claim ,",
    "we consider well - known requirements modeling approaches , which emphasize high - level abstractions such as goals and dependencies @xcite but do not accord first - class status to interactions .    even in the simple appointment scheduling setting ,",
    "the benefits of iose are obvious : what was previously seen as the problem of specifying a meeting scheduler , under iose turns into two independent problems of ( 1 ) specifying the meeting scheduling protocol , and ( 2 ) specifying principals to participate in the protocol .",
    "this reflects parnas conception of modularity as the _ division of labor_.    our evaluation of the traditional approaches is not a blanket criticism but rather a critical examination that highlights the differences in their assumptions from the principles of iose .",
    "further , our evaluation was limited to the system models or specifications that existing approaches advocate .",
    "we did not , for instance , dwell upon the modeling of functional versus nonfunctional requirements or the elicitation of requirements from stakeholders , areas in which current sociotechnical systems approaches ( including i * , tropos , and kaos ) have made substantial progress .",
    "although we carefully differentiate iose from traditional se , the two complement each other .",
    "iose deals with systems ( viewed as protocols ) whereas traditional re deals with components or principals behaviors ( viewed as machines ) .",
    "the former is typified by commitments and other social constructs ; the latter by goals and other mental constructs .",
    "recent works @xcite have begun to relate these views from the standpoint of building agents who can function effectively in sociotechnical systems characterized by commitments .",
    "we have recently @xcite , sought to apply tropos - like models towards the specification of sociotechnical systems .",
    "these works replace intentional dependencies with commitments and do not consider a system actor .",
    "further , each actor is understood as a role , i.e. , inert and lacking any goals .",
    "goals are applied in the modeling the principals who may potentially adopt roles in the sociotechnical system .",
    "we defer the task of systematically laying out the methodological elements of iose , as they overlay the main concepts and principles we introduced above .",
    "we expect to go beyond methodologies for specifying and composing protocols , e.g. , @xcite , by incorporating the key re considerations of stakeholders and requirements .",
    "the nature of requirements for protocols appears quite different from requirements for machines .",
    "for example , a requirement such as `` a meeting is scheduled within three hours of the request '' makes sense for a machine but not a protocol  though it could be negotiated between the principals playing the mi and mp roles .",
    "a requirement that `` a principal can observe whether another principal is complying with some commitment '' makes sense for a protocol but less so for a machine .",
    "the bases from which to engineer protocols is a timely and pertinent direction of research .",
    "we imagine that existing re methodologies would provide a useful starting point for investigations into a methodology for iose .",
