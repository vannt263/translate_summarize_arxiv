    "we have recently completed a search of 56 unidentified mid - latitude egret @xmath0-ray sources for pulsations using the parkes telescope and the multibeam receiver .",
    "this survey covered @xmath1140 square degrees of sky at galactic latitudes @xmath2 and revealed six new pulsars , three of which are in binary systems . here",
    "we present initial timing results for the three binaries .",
    "the properties of the three new binaries are summarized in table  1 and their pulse profiles are shown in figure  2 .    .newly discovered binaries [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath3 assuming a pulsar mass ( @xmath4 ) of 1.4m@xmath5 .",
    "+ @xmath6 dm distance from the ne2001 electron density model of the galaxy ( cordes & lazio 2002 , astro - ph/0207156 ) .",
    "+      psr  j1614@xmath72230 is a recycled millisecond pulsar with a very low inferred magnetic field ( @xmath8 g ) .",
    "it has the highest minimum companion mass of the @xmath150 binary pulsars with spin periods lower than 8ms , suggesting a possible non - standard evolution .",
    "compared with the orbital period versus companion mass relationship of rappaport et al .",
    "1995 ( mnras , 273 , 731 ) the orbital period of psr  j1614@xmath72230 is short by a factor @xmath910 for its companion mass . the companion may be a cno white dwarf or a low - mass degenerate dwarf .",
    "the spin - down rate of psr  j1614@xmath72230 gives an @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 , which is just barely consistent with the flux measured from the @xmath0-ray source in whose error box this pulsar was found .",
    "if the pulsar is the counterpart it would demand a very high @xmath0-ray efficiency , or a significantly closer distance than what is inferred from the dm .      psr  j1614@xmath72318 is likely partially recycled ( @xmath12 g ) .",
    "it has the lowest minimum companion mass of any binary pulsar with spin period between 10 and 100ms .",
    "the pulse profile is relatively wide at 1.4ghz ( @xmath130% of the pulse period at fwhm ) . at @xmath1350mhz",
    "the higher signal - to - noise ratio of the profile shows that there are wings on either side of the main pulse ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "it is possible that we are seeing emission from the core and cone of the beam .",
    "psr  j1744@xmath73922 was also independently discovered by the parkes multibeam galactic plane survey ( a. lyne , private communication ) .",
    "it is possibly partially recycled ( @xmath13 g ) and is one of only @xmath116 binary pulsars with spin periods greater than 50ms ( of these it has the shortest orbital period and the third smallest minimum companion mass ) .",
    "it is difficult to detect at times , as it seems to shut off and turn on on timescales as short as a few tens of seconds ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "since its dm is relatively high , it is unlikely that scintillation is responsible for the many non - detections of the pulsar .",
    "psr  j1744@xmath73922 has also been very difficult to detect at wavelengths other than @xmath11.4ghz .",
    "observations with the gbt have improved the detection rate of this strange pulsar .",
    "we have applied for exploratory observations of all three pulsars presented here with the 8-m gemini - south optical telescope in order to determine the magnitudes and colors of their binary companions and to see if they are consistent with being white dwarfs .",
    "these observations may lead to future spectroscopic observations of the companions , which could allow us to determine the neutron star masses and distances to the systems . with a clearer picture of the nature of the companion stars we would also be in a better position to comment on how these systems fit in with theories of binary evolution ."
