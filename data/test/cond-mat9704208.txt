    "fluidized beds are widely used in chemical industries since early 19 s , and they have been studied from technological point of views .",
    "fluidized beds consist of granular particles confined in a tall chamber with distributor for the fluid flow at the bottom . in experiments , energy injection to the system",
    "is controlled by the flow rate of fluid . at low flow rate ,",
    "the system is in the fixed phase where particles rest on the bottom . when the flow rate exceeds the critical value , particles start moving .",
    "this state is called the fluidized phase , which contains sub phases , for instance , the homogeneous phase , the bubbling phase , the channeling phase , etc .",

    "we now introduce the average of @xmath31 defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the period of regular behavior in @xmath31 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : eng - u ] , we observe a continuous transition at @xmath30 and the linear behavior of @xmath35 in the fluidized phase ( @xmath36 ) .",

    "equation ( [ eq : eng - u - fit ] ) defines @xmath39 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter - space ] .",
    "now we show that the transition of fluidization can be understood as the process generating the free volume around the particles in the fixed phase .",
    "it is useful to remember that our model is galilei invariant , that is , the system with the fixed particles of @xmath40 under the flow rate @xmath20 is equivalent to that with the fixed particles of @xmath41 under the flow rate @xmath42 .",
    "let us consider the process under the latter situation .",
    "first we define @xmath43 which is the falling velocity of the mobile particles in the fixed phase without the support of fixed particles .",
    "if the flow rate @xmath20 is smaller than @xmath43 , the mobile particles can not pass over the fixed particles moving downward with @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the mobile particles hold on the fixed particles and the gap between the mobile particles and the fixed particles is not generated . while the flow rate @xmath20 is larger than @xmath43 , the mobile particles apart from the fixed particles and then the gap between them is generated .",
    "the gap causes the rayleigh - taylor instability observed when a heavy fluid exists above a light fluid@xcite .",
    "then the gap may grow into a bubble and propagate upward through the particles , or may construct a channel . from this discussion ,",
    "the critical flow rate @xmath39 is determined by the falling velocity @xmath43 .",

    "figure [ fig : cofm - vari - st ] shows the corresponding behavior for @xmath51 and the transition is observed around @xmath52 . for other cases ,",
    "the channel - bubble transitions are observed in the area shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter - space ] .",
    "we also observe some qualitative changes in the physical quantities corresponding to the channel - bubble transitions . here",
    "we discuss the behavior of @xmath53 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : eng - st ] , we see that @xmath54 increases with @xmath1 in the channeling phase , and @xmath54 decreases with @xmath1 in the bubbling phase .",
    "the behavior in the channeling phase can be understood by the following reason . at @xmath55 ,",
    "we observe a steady channel , no relative motions among particles .",
    "when @xmath1 increases , the particles on the channel can be fluidized .",
    "this is because @xmath1 is the relaxation time of the particle velocity @xmath3 to their terminal velocity @xmath4 , which is determined under the case of @xmath55 , and the non - relaxed particles cause the collapse of the channel",
    ". therefore , @xmath53 increases with @xmath1 in the channeling phase . on the other hand ,",
    "we observe that @xmath54 decreases with @xmath1 in the bubbling phase .",
    "this can be understood as follows . from the previous paper @xcite or in fig .",
    "[ fig : eng - time ] , we have seen that the relative motion of particles or the kinetic energy is generated by bubbles which have the difference of the local volume fraction in the system .",
    "in fact , bubbles are always accompanied by the convective motion of particles . because @xmath1 is the response time of the velocity for the change of configurations , bubbles become obscure as @xmath1 increases .",
    "in fact , we see a sharp bubble and the definite convective motion of particles for @xmath56 ( fig . [",
    "fig : cnf - b266f3-convex ] ) , while we see a relatively obscure bubble and the weaker convection for @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cnf - b266g3-bubble ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath53 in the bubbling phase decreases with @xmath1 . as a result",
    ", @xmath53 has a peak around the transition point .",
    "this reflects on the @xmath1 dependence of various properties such as @xmath58 shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : visc - einstein ] and @xmath59 discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : liquid ] .      in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate the existence of surprising correspondences in statistical quantities between fluidized beds which is in highly nonequilibrium states and quasi equilibrium systems .",
    "the result of @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ fig : eng - u ] suggests that the flow rate @xmath20 behaves as the effective temperature of the environment such as that of the heat bath for equilibrium systems .",
    "therefore , the critical flow rate @xmath39 may correspond to the critical temperature and @xmath54 may be the order parameter of the fluidization . in the following",
    ", we will interpret the results of our simulations using this effective temperature @xmath20 .    in nearly equilibrium systems at temperature @xmath60 ,",
    "the resistance @xmath61 of a tracer particle is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the diffusion constant and @xmath64 is the boltzmann constant@xcite .",
    "this is the einstein relation and is the simplest form of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem which relates the correlation functions in the equilibrium state and the transport coefficients .",
    "similarly , we introduce for our simulations the effective viscosity @xmath65 as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the diffusion constant of our simulations defined by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the fourier transform of @xmath70 calculated by the standard fft .",

    "[ fig : visc - diff - u ] and [ fig : visc - diff - st ] .",
    "if the definition of the viscosity ( [ eq : einstein - fb ] ) is self - consistent , the einstein relation or the fluctuation - dissipation relation in fluidized beds may be valid with the replacement of @xmath71 by @xmath20 .",
    "this statement is interesting because the system is in a highly nonequilibrium state and there is no reason of the existence of the fluctuation - dissipation relation in the sense of linear nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "we find that the flow - rate dependence of the viscosity @xmath72 obtained by eq .",

    "here we review our model of fluidized beds , presented in the previous paper@xcite , where only essences are extracted from real systems and all other irrelevant mechanisms are neglected .",
    "we construct the model by only four mechanisms , which are the inertial effect of the particles , hydrodynamic interaction through the fluid , the gravitational force and the contact force .",

    "for example , if there are some dimples on the surface of the particles , they collide before the mean surfaces contact .",
    "from another point of view we can also say that the continuous description of the fluid in the gap between the particles breakdowns when particles approach closely and the gap becomes comparable to the mean - free path of the molecules of the fluid@xcite .",
    "recently a model in this context has been presented@xcite .",
    "they introduce a cut - off length , which may correspond to the height of the dimples on the surface or the mean - free path of the fluid molecules .",
    "if particles approach with each other within the cut - off length , the gap between them is assumed to be the cut - off in calculation of hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "the result of their simulation is suggestive even though the situation , which is the behavior in the shearing flow without the gravity , is different .",
    "their results are characterized by the parameter @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the stokes number in shear flow with the shear rate @xmath129 and @xmath130 is the averaged resistance of a tracer with the same volume fraction and the cut - off length .    from the above discussion",
    ", we get the meaning of the effective stokes number @xmath1 as @xmath131 which depends on the cut - off length of the real systems .",
    "we need more delicate investigations for the dependence of the cut - off length or the mechanism preventing the singularity in the lubrication ."
