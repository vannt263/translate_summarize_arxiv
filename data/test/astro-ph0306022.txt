    "we have designed , and placed into operation , a ccd camera system optimized for high speed time - series measurements of oscillating white dwarf stars .",
    "our experience indicates that ccd instruments designed for more general use will have characteristics that are unacceptable for rapid time - series measurements , or seriously compromise the data quality when used for this purpose . until this instrument was available ,",
    "we relied on time - series photometers using photomultiplier ( pmt ) detectors for these measurements ( nather & warner 1971 ; kleinman , nather , & phillips 1996 ) .",
    "we are now in a position to compare and contrast these two approaches to the same measurements , and to demonstrate where ccds are superior for this work and where they are not .",
    "one basic goal in the design of this instrument was to take advantage of the improved quantum efficiency that ccd detectors offer , so that we could obtain usable data on fainter stars than the pmt instruments could measure , and data of better quality on those they could .",
    "we also hoped to discover more variable white dwarf stars than were already known , to increase the limited number of objects available for asteroseismological study .",
    "a more long - term goal was to provide an instrument whose timing accuracy was high enough to allow a search for small deviations from the smooth secular change in pulsation frequency due to white dwarf cooling ( e.g. kepler et al .",
    "2000 ) , opening the possibility that such deviations , if found to be periodic , could demonstrate the presence of planet - sized objects in orbit around the white dwarf star ( winget et al . 2003 ; mullally et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we have achieved our short - term goals in the 15 months the instrument has been in operation , and have established a list of target objects for the longer - term search for primordial planets .",
    "our search for white dwarf variables has already more than doubled the number available for study ( mukadam et al .",
    "2003a ) , due primarily to increased instrumental sensitivity .",
    "our practical limit using the pmt photometers on the 82-in telescope at mcdonald observatory was about magnitude 17.0 ; we now obtain light curves of comparable quality at magnitude 19.4 , a gain of about a factor of 9 in overall sensitivity . to obtain a similar gain with the pmt photometers they would have to be attached to a telescope 6 m in aperture .",
    "our ccd time - series photometer , which we call argos , is based on a commercial ccd camera made by roper scientific , the princeton micromax 512bft  nte - ccd .",
    "its specifications are shown in table 1 .",
    "ll pixel size : & 13@xmath0@xmath113@xmath0 + pixel array size : & 512@xmath1512 , back illuminated + on  chip storage : & 512@xmath1512 , frame transfer operation + frame transfer time : & 310@xmath0s + readout rate : & 1 mhz , 16 bit a / d conversion + readout time : & 0.28s , full frame with no binning + cooling : & thermoelectric + fan air exhaust + chip temperature : & -45c + readout noise : & 8 electrons rms + gain & 2 electrons / adu + dark noise : & 12 adu / s / pixel + optical coating : & broadband anti - reflection + quantum efficiency : & 30% at 3500a , 80% 4500 - 6500a , 40% at 9000a + linearity : & @xmath2 1% below 40,000 adu ( saturation at 65,000 adu ) +    the ccd chip is back - illuminated to improve its blue sensitivity ( most white dwarf stars are blue ) and can transfer its 512@xmath1512 pixel image to the on - chip buffer in 310@xmath0s .",
    "we have built a mount to support the camera at the prime focus of the 82-in telescope ( f/3.9 ) , and obtain there an image scale to match the 13@xmath3 pixel size : 3.05 pixels per arcsecond .",
    "the field of view for this image scale is 2.8 arcmin on a side , large enough so we have not had any trouble finding our targets , along with suitable comparison stars . since the target can be placed almost anywhere in the chip , the usable area to search for comparison stars",
    "is about 25 square arcminutes .",
    "the camera incorporates a thermoelectric cooling system that keeps the chip at -45c , where the dark count of 12 adu / s is smaller than the counts coming from the moonless sky ( ca .",
    "37 adu / s ) .",
    "the readout noise of 8 electrons rms is negligible for all except the shortest exposure times , where it is comparable to sky noise .",
    "the image readout time of 280ms is comfortably shorter than our minimum exposure time of 1s .",
    "the prime focus mount design ( see figure 1 ) includes a manual two - position filter slide , which can double as a dark slide when we want to take dark or bias frames .",
    "the camera came with an internal shutter for this purpose , but we removed it when it proved to be unreliable .",
    "the ccd camera connects to the st-133 controller ( electronics box ) via a 10 ft .",
    "analog cable , both of which are mounted at the prime focus of the 82-in telescope .",
    "the interface card housed in the camera control computer ( see section 2.7 ) connects to the controller via a 75 ft .",
    "digital high speed communication cable .",
    "frame transfer operation is started by a single synchronizing pulse from a timer card ( see section 2.6 ) which serves to end one exposure and begin the next one ; the pulse is sent to the camera via a 75 ft .",
    "co - axial cable .",
    "we have also attached a smaller uncooled ccd camera ( electrim edc2000n ) with a wide angle lens to capture regular images of the dome slit ( see section 2.5 ) .",
    "while the ccd chip is more sensitive than the bi - alkali pmt detectors , its wavelength response is enough different so that combining ccd and pmt data on the same star may not be done directly .",
    "our chief interest lies in blue pulsating da white dwarfs , whose pulsation amplitudes are a function of wavelength ( robinson et al .",
    "1995 , nitta et al .",
    "1998 , nitta et al .",
    "including photons redward of the pmt cutoff ( ca .",
    "650 nm ) , which are less modulated by the pulsation process , reduces the measured amplitude ( kanaan et al .",
    "we thought we might improve the signal  to  noise ratio in our light curves by inserting a blue filter ( 1 mm schott bg40 ) , and indeed found the measured amplitudes are higher by about 15% .",
    "however , photon losses in the filter increased the measurement noise , and we find no significant improvement in the signal  to  noise ratio by using it .",
    "the camera mounting plate can be moved by x - y adjustment screws over a distance of half an inch to center the ccd chip on the optical axis of the telescope .",
    "the tip / tilt of the camera can be controlled by a push - pull arrangement of screws , to set the ccd chip perpendicular to the axis .",
    "the alignment procedure is adequate but awkward .",
    "when properly aligned , the corners of the chip are 2 arcmin from the optical axis , where aberration from coma due to the parabolic primary mirror is calculated to expand a point image to about 1 arcsecond in diameter .",
    "we rarely experience sub - arcsecond seeing at mcdonald observatory , so we have not been able to verify this calculation .",
    "scattered light was initially a significant problem .",
    "the first three nights of the commissioning run proved beyond doubt that the shiny aluminium surfaces of the mount had to be darkened ; we chose hard black anodizing for the purpose , as it does not corrode easily .",
    "the single crude baffle in the original design was replaced with a five - stage baffle system consisting of two thin plates very close to the camera , and three other baffles in the body of the mount .",
    "the two camera baffles and the mount baffle closest to the camera have square shaped apertures with rounded corners and are derived by projecting the light beam backwards from the ccd chip .",
    "these openings are a few percent larger than the converging light beam from the primary .",
    "the other two mount baffles have circular apertures , which are 57% bigger than the light beam .",
    "the edges of all the light baffles are at an angle of @xmath4 with respect to the optic axis to reflect light away from the ccd camera .",
    "the original flat - field images were very strange , but have now been improved so that people no longer laugh at them .",
    "our current images are flat to within a few percent ; the variation in the flat fields comes from structural non - uniformities in the ccd chip itself .",
    "this pattern is stable and can be removed , giving us residual variations less than one percent .",
    "one significant problem remains : in its normal position at prime focus , the camera , and its mount , can collide with structures inside the dome .",
    "the dome slit has a heavy steel bridge spanning its width , and on each end of the bridge are hand - cranked pods ( called pulpits ) that can hold an observer ; by moving the bridge and cranking a pulpit , an intrepid observer can reach the prime focus for visual guiding . this is clearly dangerous , and has not seen use since the prime focus ( photographic plate ) camera was retired about 35 years ago , but is still used to help balance the telescope and to support a crane that can handle the primary mirror for aluminizing . since we ca nt remove the bridge and pulpits we must learn to live with them .    to this end",
    "we have added cyclops , a small uncooled ccd camera with a wide - angle lens ( @xmath5 fov ) to the argos camera , looking out past the dome slit at the night sky beyond . with suitable exposure times",
    "it can see the moonless sky as significantly brighter than the inside of the dome , and can thus define the position of the prime focus mount with respect to the slit as well as the bridge and pulpit structure ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the circle shows the size and location of the 82-in telescope beam .",
    "the edge of the lower windscreen , just above the bridge / pulpit structure , appears at the lower left in the image .",
    "the camera s dynamic range is large enough to define the prime focus mount position in the daytime as well , when the dome is closed and illuminated from the inside .",
    "we use a dedicated pc to run the camera whenever argos is mounted on the telescope .",
    "suitable software to warn of impending disaster , and perhaps prevent it , is now under development .",
    "the images by themselves are already useful , telling the observer when it is time to move the dome .",
    "cyclops has detected raindrops as well .",
    "a time - series photometer must know precisely when an exposure is started , and precisely how long it took .",
    "these are two different requirements , involving both a time epoch and an interval .",
    "the argos timing system is based on a gps clock designed primarily for precision timekeeping , although position information is also available .",
    "it consists of an oven - controlled crystal oscillator disciplined by signals obtained from a gps receiver .",
    "the time epoch is claimed to have an error of about 50ns , considerably more precise than we need , but comforting .",
    "we have assembled a simple count - down register on a small circuit card that can accept the 1 hz timing pulses from the gps clock , and can provide an output pulse to initiate frame transfer in the ccd camera .",
    "the exposure intervals are thus contiguous , and determined directly from the clocking hardware .",
    "the timer card plugs into the parallel port on the camera control pc , so the countdown value ( i.e. the exposure time ) can be set into it from software .",
    "thereafter it operates independently , initiating frame transfer operations at the established timing intervals .",
    "exposure times can be set to any integral number of seconds from 1 to 30 .    immediately following a 1 hz timing pulse",
    ", the gps clock provides information from which the precise epoch of the pulse can be determined .",
    "the information arrives encoded in packet form at the serial port of the pc at 9600 baud , where it can be read and unencoded by the software control program .",
    "the pc serial port is buffered so that the epoch ( the time and date ) for each pulse can be determined even if a second packet arrives before the first one is read by the program .",
    "a second clock , somewhat less accurate , is available if the camera control pc is running the network time protocol ( ntp ) software , which obtains timing information over the internet by periodically contacting time servers and adjusting the pc system clock accordingly .",
    "it allows for internet time delays as well as it can , and averages the best readings it finds to keep the system clock in proper synchronization .",
    "the argos control program relies primarily on the gps clock for timing , but can use the ntp - disciplined system clock if the gps time signals are not available . for observer assurance ,",
    "it compares the time ticks from the two clocks , and displays their time difference in a status display window . after both clocks have been running for a few hours , the time difference is usually within a few milliseconds .",
    "the pc that controls the camera has fairly modest requirements by modern standards : it must have a pci bus to accept the camera control card , a parallel port ( for the timer card ) , a serial port ( for the gps packet information ) , enough memory to run the linux operating system comfortably ( 256 mb is enough , but more is always better ) and enough disk space to hold the images as they arrive ( 527 kb each ) .",
    "our current camera control pc runs a pentium iii at 1 ghz and is not pushed for time .",
    "the software prefers a display resolution of 1280x1024 so the various windows do not overlap each other . a 17-in lcd works fine .",
    "the pc also needs an ethernet card to connect to the internet , so the ntp software can discipline the system clock , and to receive pointing information from the computer that controls the 82-in telescope .",
    "this connection is also used to transfer image data to our argos data archive in austin ( slowly ) , and to allow a remote login to run the camera for testing purposes ( even more slowly ) .",
    "we usually operate a second pc as well , with access to the disk on the camera control computer , so arriving image data can be examined by software not concerned with the data acquisition and recording process .",
    "we also make a more durable copy of the data on cd - rom . someday ,",
    "when the dvd format wars are over , we may move to that medium to minimize the number of disks required .",
    "the control program is called quilt 11 ( q11 ) , the most recent in a series of programs designed to control time - series photometers .",
    "the name was originally chosen because the first of the series , quilt 1 , started as a patchwork of software routines .",
    "it was written in 1970 , and has undergone 10 complete rewrites , in different languages for different computers , since that time .",
    "the basic operations havent really changed much .",
    "once the camera has been set to operate in frame transfer mode , images arrive via direct memory access ( dma ) at the end of each exposure and appear magically in memory .",
    "the program must first associate each image with its epoch ( start time and date ) before it is written to disk .",
    "this is not quite as straightforward as it sounds : a new exposure starts when a frame transfer operation finishes , so the epoch is available right away , but obviously the image is not  it s still being exposed .",
    "it only shows up after the next timing pulse ( and its epoch ) arrives , and then only after the readout process has finished .",
    "the program must keep all this straight so the proper epoch is associated with the appropriate image .",
    "the data images are recorded in fits format , with the epoch and other operating parameters in the header .",
    "each image has its own file , so the file name must be generated automatically and the names must be sequential so they can be kept in proper time order .",
    "figure 3 shows what the computer `` desktop '' looks like with the program in operation .",
    "the window labeled `` commands '' accepts simple typed keyboard commands ( go , stop , abort , etc . ) to control the camera , as well as commands to edit entries in the window labeled `` setmode '' which provides the q11 program with information and parameters that it can not determine for itself .",
    "the user may then mark the target and comparison stars on the image ( small , labelled circles appear in response to mouse clicks ) to enable on - line extraction and display of plotted light curves .    in our design",
    "the images arrive whenever a frame transfer pulse is generated by the clock  that is , all the time .",
    "these images are shown on the display screen by a program called ds9 , written by william joy and his colleagues at sao and made available as open source software .",
    "plotted light curves are displayed by the ds9 plotting widget .",
    "once data recording starts ( in response to the `` go '' command ) , the observer must act as an aide to the program to do things it can not do for itself : keep the star images on the chip , keep the dome out of the light path , and be prepared to shut things down if it rains .",
    "in addition to plotting the light curve , the program also prints columns of numbers on the terminal used to start the program : the image number , the elapsed time , and the extracted brightness for each of the marked stars with sky removed .",
    "the last column shows the average sky value that was subtracted from the target star .",
    "the program can also be run in simulation mode , without a telescope , camera or gps timing system .",
    "previously recorded data images are read from disk into the same buffer used by the camera , and the timing is simulated from the system clock ticks .",
    "users can use this mode to review data previously recorded , and to learn how the program works .",
    "the same code is used in both modes , with very few exceptions .",
    "if the program is started with a command - line pathname to a data run , simulation mode is assumed ; without one , it assumes it must run the camera for real . simulation mode goes through all of the motions involved in a real run but does not write anything to disk .",
    "the q11 program is written in the c language , and consists of 5 separate executable processes in simultaneous execution .",
    "it is designed to run on a pc under the linux operating system and to tolerate the presence of other programs running at the same time on the same cpu . both incoming time and",
    "image data are buffered to maintain proper real - time operation .",
    "details of its architecture and the on - line extraction algorithms are presented in appendix a.      the data acquisition and on - line extraction process runs in a thread separate from the display process because of timing considerations : the display routines ( ds9 and its plotting widget ) are written in tcl / tk , an interpreted language , and are therefore slow . at the shortest exposure times",
    "the acquisition process can easily keep up but the display routines can not . arranged as separate threads of execution , they run in parallel , so acquisition gets its needed amount of cpu time even if display falls behind .",
    "should this happen , the user still sees the printed luminosity values appear right away , but the plotted values appear in clumps , rather than one at a time , whenever the plot widget gets updated .",
    "no data points are lost .",
    "display of some of the incoming images may be skipped , but the ds9 window always shows the most recent one when it is updated .",
    "the q11 program can run under any window manager , but users notice how much more slowly the display windows are updated using gnome or kde , compared with windowmaker , which is much smaller and faster .",
    "the most notable improvement offered by the argos instrument is the ability to record individual images for each integration for later inspection and analysis .",
    "this is very much like the historical transition that took place as photographic observations replaced visual ones . extracting the measured brightness of the target",
    ", comparison star and sky is done directly with the 3-channel pmt photometer , in the equivalent of three large pixels , through fixed apertures that isolate them from the rest of the stars in the field .",
    "what they see is what you get , with no going back .",
    "the digital images arriving from the ccd are recorded as individual disk files and can be replayed without loss in the same time sequence as they were taken , with their time intervals the same as the original exposure times for simulation , or faster for analysis and reduction .",
    "different extraction techniques can be applied for comparison , and the light curves with the highest signal - to - noise ratio chosen for further analysis .",
    "when a data point appears that does not fit well with those surrounding it , the corresponding image can be examined , and often reveals the cause ( `` oh . i guess that s where i dropped my flashlight . '' ) we find far more satellite tracks through the images than we ever expected .",
    "the higher quantum efficiency of the ccd coupled to the greater bandwidth gives higher photon counts from the same target stars , compared to the pmt photometers .",
    "argos is designed such that light from the primary mirror forms an image of the star field directly on the ccd , so it has fewer optical surfaces than the pmt photometers .",
    "figure 4 shows the light curves of the same white dwarf pulsator g117b15a taken with the two different instruments , 5 weeks apart , on the 82-in telescope with 5s exposures .",
    "observing conditions were excellent for the pmt run , but only average for the ccd ; even so , the ccd data are less noisy .",
    "the ability to measure fainter stars is illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "the target star , a new da variable wd0815 + 4437 ( mukadam et al .",
    "2003a ) , has a b magnitude comparable to 19.3 , and clearly shows the pulsations ; the ft shows two significant peaks ( probably unresolved in this short run ) and hints at more .",
    "smoothing the light curve with a running average of 3 data points ( to suppress noise at higher frequencies ) shows the variations more clearly .",
    "the pmt photometers separate the target and comparison star fields optically , and do this before the image of the field is formed at the focal plane .",
    "this works , but introduces a vignetting property which the users must be aware of , and avoid .",
    "this means the comparison star must always be at least 3 arcminutes away .",
    "changing transparency from thin cloud does not always act on the target and comparison stars at the same time , so removing the effects of cloud by dividing the target light curve with that of the comparison star does not always work very well .",
    "this technique of cloud removal works far better on the ccd images . in figure 6",
    "we show our data on the new da variable wd0949 - 0000 ( mukadam et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b ) taken through light cloud with 10s exposures on 2 april , 2003 .",
    "the top panel shows the sum of 2 comparison stars , collectively brighter than the target by a factor of 150 .",
    "the center panel shows the faint ( b@xmath618.8 ) target star .",
    "the cloud - induced variations disappear when the target is divided by the comparison light curve .",
    "the pmt photometers require considerable skill and experience on the observer s part to get everything set up properly , and to tend the observations continually during a run . failing to align the two stars properly in their apertures , or to guide often enough but",
    "not too often , takes some time to learn .",
    "inexperienced observers can ( and do ) take data of poor quality until they have made most of the common mistakes and learned from them .",
    "the argos photometer demands far less skill and experience ; once the ccd instrument is set up properly , far less is demanded of an observer , and inexperienced observers can ( and do ) take good quality data on their first observing run with the instrument .",
    "target starfields are much easier to locate and verify , and , unlike the pmt photometers , faint targets are as easy to find as bright ones .",
    "a photomultiplier detector amplifies individual photoelectrons until they can be readily detected as individual events ; a ccd does not . in a ccd",
    "each pixel well collects unamplified photoelectrons until they are read out , amplified _ en masse _ , and sent to an analog - to - digital converter ( a / d ) over a 10 ft .",
    "cable . the cable and its connectors are by far the weakest link in the instrument and can cause real grief if not properly maintained . in the argos instrument",
    "the default amplifier gain is set so that two electrons yield one adu , and has a noise equivalent of 8 electrons .",
    "this means that 64 or more electrons must be collected before their stochastic noise and the amplifier noise are equal .",
    "we try to keep pixel counts below 40,000 to avoid the onset of nonlinear behavior ; the pmt instruments have a somewhat wider dynamic range .",
    "these are not major problems , but can hardly be considered assets .",
    "pmt detectors can count individual photon events , and these events can be placed into accurate time bins as short as desired .",
    "the ccd detector must accumulate many photon events before they can be measured , so the minimum time bins must be much longer .",
    "the pmt instruments work well in measuring lunar occultations where 12 millisecond time bins are required , and for optical pulsar measurements where the time bins as short as 1 microsecond have been used ( sanwal , robinson , & stiening 1998 ) .",
    "the smallest time bin available in the argos instrument , 1s , is short enough for measuring pulsating white dwarf stars , but not short enough for these other measurements .",
    "roper scientific , the corporate owners of princeton instruments who made the ccd camera , have a policy of not revealing technical details of either their hardware or their control software ; users are given access to the camera s operation by a series of calls to a software library they provide .",
    "the user must therefore treat the camera and its controlling software as a black box , and can infer or measure details of its operation ( e.g. timings ) only by doing experiments .",
    "this makes trouble - shooting and time - critical program development both slow and difficult .",
    "the argos instrument , and its software , are unlikely to evolve into more effective operation so long as this policy is in place .",
    "the argos instrument was placed into regular operation ( with a less capable version of the software ) in february 2002 . until this writing ( april 2003 )",
    "it has achieved the following results :    * its increased sensitivity has allowed the identification of 36 variable white dwarf stars previously unknown ( mukadam et al .",
    "2003a ) , more than doubling the total number of these objects available for study . * the improved data quality , and the resulting improvement in measuring the time of arrival of pulses from the dav white dwarf g117-b15a ,",
    "has yielded the first measured @xmath7 ( kepler et al .",
    "2003 ) for the rate of change of the 215s principle period ( previous measurements had only set limits ) .",
    "this is the first such measurement for a star this cool ( and this old ) , and opens the way to calibrating by measurement , rather than by theory , the ages of the oldest stars in our galaxy ( e.g. winget et al .",
    "1987 ; hansen et al .",
    "* the control software and a second ccd camera was used successfully at siding spring observatory on the 1 m telescope in support of a whole earth telescope run in may , 2002 .",
    "the f/8 cassegrain focal position gave about the same plate scale , and the same size images , as the prime focus position on the 82-in ( f/3.9 ) telescope .",
    "we thank dr .",
    "frank bash , director of mcdonald observatory , for providing the funds to purchase the ccd cameras , and the texas advanced research program for operating funds under grant arp-0543 .",
    "we thank gary hansen for designing the timer card , gordon wesley and david boyd for the mount design , and phillip mcqueen for advice on the baffle design .",
    "we also thank antonio kanaan for the use of his ccd data reduction routines , and darragh odonoghue for showing us that off - axis coma would not be a problem .",
    "we thank denis sullivan for his help in the commissioning runs for both the ccd cameras , argos and cyclops .      before on - line extraction can begin , the user must first tell the program which star image in a field is the target star , and which other images it should use as comparison stars . when the `` mark '' command is detected the current image",
    "is copied to a separate image buffer , and the display process is directed there .",
    "new images will still arrive , but will not be shown until marking has been completed .",
    "the process by which stars on a new image are identified with those initially marked is based on a simple assumption : that a star image may move around on the ccd chip , but its location with respect to other stars in the same field will not change ( much ) .",
    "the identification algorithm therefore needs to remember a pattern of star images found in one image , so it can identify elements of the same pattern in a new one .",
    "pattern recognition is a famously difficult programming problem , but we are fortunate here on two counts : first , our patterns are very simple , and can be reduced to a small list of x , y locations of points in a plane ; second , we are really interested in pattern re - recognition , which is a far easier problem to solve .    to make this work , the program must first isolate the individual stars in an image ( described in the next section ) , and make a position list ( plist ) for each one , recording its x , y location along with other useful values .",
    "the position is taken to be the pixel with the highest count in it . from this position list ,",
    "the marking process can first identify which image the user indicates with the mouse click , and can then make a reference list ( rlist ) of distance and position angle ( dpa ) to other stars in the field for later comparison .",
    "the identification algorithm finds a known star in a new image by first deriving a set of dpa s for it ( from the plist of image locations ) and then comparing them with the rlists saved from the marked stars . in effect",
    ", it is asking of each star in a new field , `` are you on my list ? ''",
    "most often the answer is no  the distances and position angles to other field stars do not fit one of the saved patterns , except by accident .",
    "an rlist can have up to 12 entries , and an accidental match to more than 1 or 2 of them just does nt happen , even in a crowded field .",
    "agreement with all of the rlist entries is common when a true match is found , but not required : the majority wins .",
    "one source of potential position error can arise if the rlist values are taken from a single image and remain unchanged during a run .",
    "an onset of bad seeing can cause fewer reference stars to be recognized , and changing atmospheric refraction can affect the dpa values in a systematic way . to avoid these problems , the dpa values from each new image are saved ( they were calculated to effect the comparisons ) and a new rlist is made for each marked star that is identified .",
    "the rlist that participates in the comparison process is actually a running average of the last 20 rlists encountered , explaining the cryptic entry ( `` co - add dpa s '' ) in the flow chart . to avoid contaminating the running average in case of clouds",
    ", the rlist is not added in if the sky transparency becomes poor .    even though the identification algorithm must examine every star in a new image",
    ", it does nt spend much time doing it .",
    "the richest field we have encountered has about 230 stars detected in it , but the identification process needs less than 100 milliseconds to do its job .",
    "it uses correspondingly less time if the field is less crowded .",
    "the arrival of a new image triggers a flurry of activity that results in a new data point in the light curves of any marked stars .",
    "first , though , the star images must be isolated and located on the chip before they can be identified .",
    "the process of extracting the luminosity is melded in with the isolating procedure .    by analogy",
    ", we can think of the star images as luminosity mountains rising as peaks above the plane of the sky .",
    "if we flood the plane , and consider only the peaks that rise above flood level , then they are nicely isolated and can be treated individually .",
    "we first approximate the sky level by finding the mean of all of the pixel values in the image , avl , and then setting a cut level ( flood level ) enough above that mean to avoid finding false peaks due to sky noise :      we can now scan the image one pixel at a time , and determine for each one if it is above the cut level , and therefore a part of some star image , or below it , and part of the sky level . in the process we look for successive pixels above the cut level , and contiguous with those on previous scan lines , to define a luminosity `` clump '' .",
    "we consider a clump as complete ( and therefore isolated ) when a scan in x finds no more pixels to include .",
    "the plist entry for this peak then contains the location of the maximum ( in x and y ) , its total luminosity above the cut level , and the number of pixels summed .",
    "this procedure works well for peaks that are not too broad , but can sometimes yield small false peaks near a large one when the seeing is bad or the images are a bit out of focus .",
    "akin to foothills in our analogy , these `` skirt peaks '' may confuse the identification procedure . to avoid this , when the scan is complete , the plist is examined by a routine that identifies small peaks too close to big ones and",
    "merges them in .",
    "the resulting plist is then sorted by luminosity so the brightest ones appear first ; identification can now proceed .    once a peak has been identified with a user - marked star ,",
    "its total luminosity ( plus a small correction for the fraction of its luminosity below the cut level ) becomes the next data point on its light curve , after a global sky value has been subtracted .",
    "this global sky value , found during the isolation scan , is the mean level of all the pixels below the cut level , and is really composed of sky photons , dark count , and a bias value set by the electronics to ensure only positive quantities are presented to the a / d converter .",
    "the on - line extraction process was devised to provide the user with light curves in real time , the same as with the pmt instrument , to allow the data quality to be assessed .",
    "it was not intended to be a final data reduction procedure .",
    "however , cut - level extraction proves to work far better than originally expected , and may evolve into a procedure that can rival the virtual aperture extraction technique ( odonoghue et al .",
    "2000 ) ; alternatively , that procedure could be incorporated into the q11 program as a user - selected alternative .",

    "<S> we describe a high speed time - series ccd photometer for the prime focus of the 82-in ( 2.1 m ) telescope at mcdonald observatory , and summarize the observational results we have obtained since it was placed into regular use in february , 2002 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this instrument with the three - channel time - series photometers we have previously used in the asteroseismological study of pulsating white dwarf stars , which used photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) as the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> we find the ccd instrument is about 9 times more sensitive than the pmt instruments used on the same telescope for the same exposure time . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore find and measure variable white dwarf stars some 2.4 magnitudes fainter than before , significantly increasing the number of such objects available for study . </S>"
