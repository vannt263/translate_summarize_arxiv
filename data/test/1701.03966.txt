    "because of the potential for temperature gradients or other thermal stresses to cause electronic devices to fail , knowledge of the coefficients of thermal expansion ( cte ) of materials is important .",
    "either active materials with desired thermal properties or composites of active and compensating materials can mitigate the ill effects of thermal expansion in real devices.@xcite a compensating material must be chemically and electrically compatible with the functional material and will typically contract with increasing temperature ; i.e.  it will exhibit negative thermal expansion ( nte ) . while the cte for many materials have been cataloged , the set of known nte materials is small , and materials appropriate for specific applications may not yet be available .",
    "a means of rapidly predicting the thermal expansion properties of yet - to - be investigated materials will be extremely useful .",
    "the displacement of the equilibrium positions of atoms in a material with temperature is the source of thermal expansion .",
    "while anharmonicity in the vibrations of bonded pairs of atoms will drive the atoms farther apart with increasing temperature , crystal structure also plays an essential role in the specific thermal expansion characteristics of a material , providing behaviors over the range from positive thermal expansion ( pte ) to nte .",
    "accurate theoretical modeling of thermal expansion in materials necessitates quantum mechanical calculations and dynamical calculations or , minimally , quasi - harmonic modeling . as a result ,",
    "typical calculations of thermal expansion address the microscopic causes of experimentally - observed cte on a case - by - case basis .",
    "especially prevalent recently are experimental and theoretical investigations of materials that exhibit nte , such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 ) , @xcite @xmath3,@xcite and @xmath4.@xcite except for materials with very similar electronic and structural properties , a global picture capable of guiding searches for new materials with desired thermal expansion characteristics is slow to emerge .",
    "comprehensive reviews of thermal expansion in materials , emphasizing nte in both theory and experiment , can be found in refs .   and .    for microscopic atomic displacements to create nte",
    ", the motions of the atoms must carry them into spaces already existing within the lattice , while simultaneously drawing neighboring ions closer together .",
    "it is well - known@xcite that the definition of cte , @xmath5 can , with the help of a maxwell relation , be rewritten as @xmath6 which shows that for a material to exhibit nte , entropy must increase with pressure , contrary to typical expectations . decreasing the volume available to a particle , e.g.  by increasing pressure ,",
    "is associated with decreasing entropy . the definition in eq .",
    "[ eq : cteentropy ] is isothermal which effectively means that the momentum space contribution to entropy changes negligibly relative to the real space contribution . from this",
    "we deduce that applying pressure in an nte material increases the volume available to its constituent atoms . on the other hand , applying pressure to pte materials ( at constant temperature ) results in decreasing entropy , implying a corresponding decrease in the volume available to the atoms follows from the same line of argument used above . in order for there to be more volume available to the atoms within a crystalline material under increasing pressure ,",
    "atomic motions must be directed more significantly into the open spaces within the lattice .",
    "in other words , the atomic motions possess significant components in directions perpendicular to the bonds with nearest neighbor atoms .",
    "the difference between nte and pte is therefore quantifiable by the degree to which ionic thermal displacements are longitudinal or transverse with respect to the bonds .",
    "experimental evidence supporting this view is found , for example , in a study of nte in @xmath4 , in which inelastic neutron scattering shows that the sc - f bonds lengthen with increasing temperature and that the material contracts over a wide temperature range as a result of large transverse motions of the f ions.@xcite in our recent molecular dynamics investigation we demonstrated that thermal expansion in a single structure , with expanding bonds modeled with first- and second - neighbor interactions via morse potentials , can be varied from nte to pte by increasing the second - neighbor interaction strength relative to the first - neighbor interactions .",
    "@xcite by adjusting second - neighbor interactions , we reduced the transverse motions of the light ions , resulting in the emergence of pte in the model .",
    "we propose that an approach to predicting thermal expansion can be found by scanning the literature for the structures of crystals , focusing on quantities that may have a relationship to the entropy of the material and its potential to increase or decrease with respect to pressure , such as the space occupied by ions , their coordinations , and the distribution of atomic masses .",
    "we employ the wealth of structural information in databases such as the inorganic crystal structure database ( icsd ) @xcite and the crystallographic open database ( cod ) in this work . by correlating materials with known cte to their structures",
    ", we can begin to determine useful descriptors for thermal expansion . in section  [ section : proposeddescriptors ] , we discuss the physical underpinnings for the quantities that we propose for descriptors of cte . in section  [ section : results ] , we present the choice of descriptors from the original list of quantities of interest along with the result of performing a fit using the descriptors developed .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications this correlation will have in the search for materials with desired thermal expansion properties .",
    "for each atom in a unit cell of each material , the number of nearest neighbors and formal oxidation state are determined . from this information",
    "we obtain ionic radii @xcite @xmath7 for each ion and an estimate of the volume each ion occupies ( assuming it occupies a sphere of volume @xmath8 ) .",
    "the fractional volume occupied is the total volume estimated for all the atoms in the unit cell divided by the volume of the unit cell @xmath9 : @xmath10 a complete list of the data used for this investigation is provided in the appendix[section : appendix ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphavolumeplot ] , thermal expansion data for the materials we sampled shows there is a relationship between thermal expansion and the volume occupied by atoms in the lattice ; more open space corresponds to a greater likelihood for nte .    the cluster of points with @xmath11/k in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphavolumeplot ] consists of binary materials that have the rock salt structure , with the corresponding high coordination providing an explanation for the large positive thermal expansion in these materials .",
    "we note that coulomb interactions between second neighbors will be repulsive and strong .",
    "the data point with the highest volume occupied and very low pte belongs to bn . because of its zincblende structure , the b and n atoms in bn have tetrahedral coordination .",
    "we also note that bn has a high bulk modulus , which implies that the tetrahedral bonds are strong .",
    "however , the low cte of bn suggests that ionic thermal motions are mostly directed into open spaces which are available because of low coordination .",
    "we deduce from this that bond coordination in a material is a possible descriptor to predict thermal expansion coefficients . finally , for some materials that exhibit negative thermal expansion , it has been noted that motion of light ions in the directions transverse to their bonds is at the root of their atypical thermal expansion .",
    "one underlying reason for this is that lighter ions undergo greater amplitude of motion than their heavier counterparts , which will assist the emergence of nte provided there exist open spaces and low coordinations around the light ions .",
    "therefore , we include atomic mass in the list of potential descriptors .",
    "( color online ) the experimental coefficient of thermal expansion ( cte ) is plotted as a function of fractional volume occupied as defined in eq .",

    "<S> thermal expansion in materials can be accurately modeled with careful phonon calculations within density functional theory . however , because of interest in controlling thermal expansion and the time consumed evaluating thermal expansion properties of candidate materials , either theoretically or experimentally , an approach to rapidly identifying materials with desirable thermal expansion properties would be of great utility . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the fraction of crystal volume occupied by ions , based upon ionic radii , the deviation of bond coordination divided by mean bond coordination , and the ratio of least to greatest atomic mass are descriptors that correlate with the coefficient of thermal expansion for a variety of materials found in widely accessible databases . </S>",
    "<S> correlation is greatly improved by combining these descriptors in a multi - dimensional quadratic fit . </S>",
    "<S> open space combined with a range of atomic masses and a variety of local bond coordinations indicates materials with lower coefficients of thermal expansion . </S>",
    "<S> materials with single - valued local coordination and less open space have the highest coefficients of thermal expansion . </S>"
