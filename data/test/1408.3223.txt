    "the heterogeneous network ( hetnet ) , where low - power low - complexity base - stations ( bss ) are overlaid with conventional macro bss , is being considered as a promising paradigm for increasing system capacity and coverage in a cost - effective way . due to",
    "orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) mechanism adopted in these networks , intra - cell interference is nearly null .",
    "however , the inter - cell interference ( ici ) potentially introduced by hierarchical layering of cells becomes a fundamental limiting factor to the hetnet performance . to cope with ici , fractional frequency reuse ( ffr ) , which was originally proposed in conventional macro - only networks @xcite ,",
    "is considered to be an efficient technique for ofdma - based hetnets @xcite .",
    "compared to other ici coordination schemes , the ffr method requires minimal cooperation among bss and has a less complex operational mechanism , attracting the increasing research efforts @xcite .    in a regular macro - only network as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_macroffr ] , the design of ffr is relatively a simple task .",
    "the basic mechanism is to share the available frequency band among a reuse-1 pattern and three reuse-3 patterns .",
    "the _ reuse pattern _ ( or simply _ pattern _ ) is defined as a combination of on / off activities of bss .",
    "for example , the reuse-1 pattern simply activates all the bss , and a reuse-3 pattern activates only one bs among neighboring three bss . to allocate the frequency band to different cells",
    "can be viewed equivalently as allocating frequency resources among different patterns . as a simple approach suitable in this homogeneous network",
    ", we can optimize a single parameter @xmath0 to control the bandwidth allocated to universally reused subbands , and then divided the rest of bandwidth evenly among three reuse-3 modes . as a result , each cell can schedule less vulnerable users ( e.g. , at cell - center ) to the universal subbands and cell - edge users to the subbands with lower number of active bss .    however , in a network consisting of macro and densely deployed small cells , the frequency reuse planning is no longer a simple task , due to the irregular cell location and overlaid cell deployment .",
    "the important challenges are :    \\1 .",
    "how can we select the most important patterns ?",
    ". how can we allocate the frequency resources among the selected patterns ?    obviously , the above questions are highly coupled with the user traffic distribution and user association policy . a cell with less number of associated users",
    "will likely be allocated less frequency resources . in this paper",
    ", we target at jointly optimizing the user association and multi - cell frequency allocation , and shed light on the above questions .          ffr has attracted lots of research efforts from both academia @xcite and industrial standardizations @xcite .",
    "the joint power and frequency allocation for ofdma ffr has also been studied , for example in @xcite and references cited therein . however , despite their coupled nature , the joint user association and frequency allocation for ffr has rarely been investigated . in @xcite , the authors studied a dynamic user association problem in a ffr network .",
    "however , the frequency partitioning is assumed given beforehand and fixed . in @xcite , the authors jointly optimized the user association , power and frequency allocation .",
    "however , the formulation and methodology only apply to the uplink sum rate maximization .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate the joint user association and multi - cell frequency allocation problem by treating the frequency allocation as frequency partitioning among multiple patterns . to solve the obtained mixed - integer nonconvex problem",
    ", we develop a tabu search algorithm .",
    "tabu search is regarded as a metaheuristic that guides a local search procedure to explore the solution space beyond local optimality @xcite .",
    "our development is based on the effective exploitation of problem structure , hence results in a efficient algorithm .",
    "the proposed scheme significantly improves cell - edge and median user throughput compared to no frequency allocation , without sacrificing the overall network throughput .",
    "we also provide practical criterion to narrow down the number of candidate patterns to reduce the complexity .    note that reuse pattern selection has been studied in a _ time division multiple access ( tdma ) _ macro - only network in @xcite , which is different from our formulation .",
    "besides , the hetnet deployment requires new criterion to select essential patterns .",
    "we consider a downlink ofdma hetnet , where a number of small cells are embedded in the conventional macro cellular network .",
    "the set of all cells is denoted as @xmath1 , and the cardinality @xmath2 .",
    "a set of users @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , are distributed in the network and we assume that each user is associated with only one serving cell .",
    "denote by @xmath5 the association indicator matrix , i.e. , @xmath6 if user @xmath7 is associated with cell @xmath8 , and @xmath9 otherwise .",
    "since each user is served by only one cell , we should have @xmath10 .",
    "we use @xmath11 to denote the channel gain between bs @xmath8 and user @xmath7 at subcarrier @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the large - scale channel gain including path loss and shadowing , @xmath14 accounts for the small - scale fading .",
    "we assume @xmath15 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) . following the shannon s formula ,",
    "the ergodic rate of user @xmath7 served by @xmath8-th bs under pattern @xmath16 , in bit / s / hz , can be written as @xmath17\\ ] ] where @xmath18 with @xmath19 denoting the fast fading coefficient between bs @xmath8 and user @xmath7 over an arbitrary frequency subcarrier , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the transmit power of bs @xmath8 per hz and the received noise power per hz , respectively .",
    "we assume if bs @xmath8 is active transmit power is evenly distribute across all frequencies , i.e. , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total transmit power of bs @xmath8 and @xmath24 is the system bandwidth ; otherwise @xmath25 if bs @xmath8 is muted under pattern @xmath16 .",
    "we further assume uniformly distributed noise effect over frequencies .",
    "hence the ergodic rate of ( [ ratepercarrier ] ) is uniform across the whole bandwidth for any pattern .    assuming that the set of users associated with the same bs share all the frequency resources according to a chosen scheduler , e.g. , round - robin scheduler ) .",
    "please see eq.(8 ) in @xcite ] , we can denote the average rate of user @xmath7 under pattern @xmath16 as @xmath26}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the total bandwidth , @xmath27 represents the number of users associated with bs @xmath8 .",
    "given the set of all possible reuse patterns @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 can can be pre - calculated using ( [ ratepercarrier ] ) and treated as constants .",
    "the resource allocation strategy is to distribute total @xmath24 bandwidth among different patterns .",
    "let @xmath31 be the allocation profile , where @xmath32 represents the fraction allocated to pattern @xmath16 and @xmath33 .",
    "then we can express the average user rate after frequency allocation as @xmath34",
    "our objective is to maximize the long - term network utility by optimizing the joint pattern selection and user association , as    rcl[problem1 ] _ , & & u ( , ) = _ k  _ k ( |r_k ) [ obj ] + & & _ kb \\{0,1 } [ integer constraint ] + & & _ b _ kb = 1 , k + & & _ i 0 , i + & & _ i _ i = 1    where @xmath35 is expressed in ( [ ratecombined ] ) , and @xmath36 provide a means for service differentiation .",
    "note that our developed algorithm can also work for any other concave utility functions .",
    "the formulation of ( [ problem1 ] ) is a mixed - integer nonconvex problem .",
    "even we relax the integer constraint of ( [ integer constraint ] ) to allow any continuous value between 0 and 1 for @xmath37 , the resulting problem is still nonconvex because the objective function is not jointly concave in @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the globally optimal solution is prohibitive for reasonably sized network . our contribution is to develop efficient algorithms to find out good solutions .",
    "the approach we adopted is based on the tabu search .",
    "tabu search has obtained optimal and near optimal solutions to a wide variety of combinatorial problems @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we describe the details of the tabu search procedure to solve problem ( [ problem1 ] )",
    ".      generally speaking , tabu search starts from an initial solution and moves at each iteration from the current solution to the best one in its neighborhood , even if this leads to a deterioration of the objective function value , so as to allow escaping from local optimum .",
    "the search is guided by two types of memory : short - term and long - term memory . at each iteration , the move being performed is recorded in the short - term memory and the reverse move is forbidden ( i.e. , _ tabu _ ) for a certain number of iterations ( _ tabu tenure _ ) , to avoid cycling .",
    "the tabu status of a move can be revoked through an _ aspiration _",
    "criterion if this move improves the best solution found so far .",
    "the long - term memory is used to force the search into previously unexplored areas of the search space by a _",
    "diversification strategy_. the key elements of our tabu search is the follows .",
    "the definition of the search space is simply the space of all possible solutions that can be visited during the search . for the problem of ( [ problem1 ] )",
    ", the search space could naturally be the set of all feasible @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the basic iterative step of any tabu search procedure involves moving from a current solution in the search space to one of its `` neighbors '' according to suitably defined neighborhood structure . in accordance with our definition of the search space",
    ", we define the neighborhood structure by considering moves in which a single strategy is modified , i.e. , the association of a single user , or the pattern profile @xmath39 is changed . hence , the number of neighbors in our definition is @xmath40 .",
    "one advantage of our definition of the neighborhood is that it allows efficient evaluation of the objective function for _ all _ possible neighbors of the current solution .",
    "note that if the integer variable @xmath38 is given the problem of ( [ problem1 ] ) becomes a convex problem in @xmath39 , which can be easily solved by some off - the - shelf approaches @xcite . on the other hand , for fixed @xmath39",
    "the evaluation of the objective function by allowing only a single user to change its association can be directly calculated by simple arithmetic operations .      at current iteration , if user @xmath7 changes its association from bs @xmath41 to @xmath42 , we declare tabu moving user @xmath7 back to bs @xmath41 no matter from which bs , and record this in the tabu list as @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand , if pattern profile @xmath39 is modified at current iteration , we record @xmath44 in the tabu list ( by treating the profile parameter @xmath39 as the @xmath45-th user ) . a new move is forbidden as long as it remains on the tabu list .",
    "the list has the short - term memory length of @xmath46 and is maintained on the first - in - first - out basis .",
    "although central to the tabu search method , tabus are sometimes too powerful .",
    "they may prohibit promising moves , or lead to an overall stagnation of the search process .",
    "thus , a certain mechanism called aspiration criteria is used to allow cancelling tabus .",
    "the aspiration criterion used in our implementation is a simple one : a tabu move is allowed when it results in a solution with an objective value better than that of the current best - know solution .",
    "typically in cellular networks , a user equipment ( ue ) selects a cell for association with maximum received signal strength . in a hetnet , however , this association criterion will lead to the case where the macro bss become resource constrained , whereas the small bss serve very few users , due to the much stronger transmit power of macro bss . to overcome this ,",
    "lte standards have proposed a concept called range expansion ( re ) to off - load macro ues to small cells by adding a positive bias to the downlink signal strength of small cells during the cell selection .",
    "we adopt this criterion for the determination of initial value of @xmath38 as @xmath47_{k , m}=\\left\\ {                                          \\begin{array}{rl }                                          1 & \\text{if $ m = m_k^\\star$ } \\\\                                          0 & \\text{otherwise }                                          \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the received power ( in dbm ) of user @xmath7 from bs @xmath8 , @xmath50 is the bias ( in db ) .",
    "once the initial value of @xmath38 is determined , the initial value of @xmath39 can be obtained by solving the convex optimization problem of ( [ problem1 ] ) for the given @xmath38 .      in an early implementation of the algorithm , we found out it converges to local optima very soon ( after 20 - 30 iterations ) and gets trapped in those points , in the sense that no single strategy modification can improve the current solution .",
    "hence , we implement a diversification step that will be executed after a certain number of iterations without improvement .",
    "one simple diversification strategy is to re - configure cell bias value to create a new starting solution , and run the whole search process again .",
    "however , this strategy is not very efficient because improper initialization will cause significantly longer convergence time .",
    "moreover , the knowledge of the search history is not well exploited .",
    "so the diversification step we adopted is always performed starting from the best global solution found up to this point in the search .",
    "based on the long - term memory , we select @xmath51 ( referred to as diversification amplitude ) users with lowest activity counts ( number of association modifications ) from the beginning of the search process , and randomly assign new bss for these users .",
    "thus the new solution differs from the best global solution in exactly @xmath51 components .",
    "then the search is resumed from the new solution .",
    "to prevent too quick a reversal of these associations , they are added to the short - term memory .",
    "the whole search alternates between two component methods : 1 ) a inner loop improves current solution by single strategy move and 2 ) a diversification step to create new starting solution .",
    "the inner loop is terminated after @xmath52 consecutive iterations without an improvement in the objective function .",
    "the whole search process stops after the total number of iterations reach @xmath53 .",
    "the main steps of the searches procedure is summarized in algorithm 1 .",
