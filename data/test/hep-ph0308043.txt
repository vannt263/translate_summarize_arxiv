    "the standard model ( sm ) has been the most satisfactory and widely recognized theory of particle interaction . to an extent , this is an effective theory , whose certain parameters are estimated and then refined by increasing high - precision experiments . however , this also means that the dynamical origin of some of these parameters is not found within the sm .",
    "one example is the pattern of family mixing characterized by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , which in turn is related to the sm fermion mass spectrum and cp violation .",
    "recently , considerable attention has been directed to phenomenological models with extra dimensions since among many other things , they can offer potential answers to puzzling questions related to the sm .    in theories with compact extra dimensions , each original field in higher dimensional space can be effectively `` viewed '' as a tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states in equivalent 4-d theories after compactification processes . if sm is assumed to be the low - energy manifestation of a higher dimensional theory , the tower s",
    "lowest state ( or kk zero mode ) is identified as a sm field . in @xcite",
    "( see also earlier works @xcite ) , by introducing a @xmath1-invariant yukawa interaction between a background scalar field and a fermion field in 5-d theory , after a @xmath2 compactification , one can obtain a non - trivial ( i.e. localized ) solution for the kk zero - mode wavefunction along the fifth dimension ( brane scenario ) . from a 4-d point of view ,",
    "any interaction term is now associated with a coupling being the overlap integration of extra dimensional wavefunctions of related fields .",
    "one then can flexibly control this 4-d theory effective coupling by regulating the localized wavefunctions along the extra dimension .",
    "this very interesting mechanism has found potential application in many problems such as proton decay suppression @xcite , fermion mass hierarchy @xcite , cp violation @xcite , etc .    in this work ,",
    "we discuss the problem of quark mass spectrum and mixing angles by making extensive use of a democratic structure for the mass matrices .",
    "we found that a democratic structure for the mass matrices ( dmm ) is a particularly convenient choice , because it raises quite naturally in brane picture , and it can adequately generate both quark mass spectrum and ckm matrix to the precision determined by current experimental data .",
    "previous works dealing with fermion mass hierarchy and cp violation within split - fermion scenario @xcite focus on placing fermion families on different positions in the bulk , with the possibility to make mass matrix elements , originating from couplings between geographically very distant families , approximately zero .",
    "these highly hierarchical mass matrix approach however requires additional techniques ( see section ii ) because naively localizing fermions in an arbitrary position along the extra dimension may contradict @xmath0 orbifold compactification being used . in the dmm approach",
    ", we can avoid this subtlety by localizing all fields only at the two fixed points of the orbifold , while we break the family symmetry by modifying the detailed shapes of their wavefuctions .",
    "further , the approach turns out to be more symmetric too .",
    "our work is structured as follows : in section ii we introduce the lagrangian to generate pure - phase mass matrices ( ppmm ) and dmm within a fermion localization mechanism , in section iii we give the description of parameter space , in section iv we present the numerical method and report the results for the mass spectrum and ckm matrix for the 24 parameter version of our model and in section v for the 15 parameter version . finally we give a brief conclusion of the work in section vi .",
    "we first briefly review the mechanism of fermion localization in extra dimension @xcite .",
    "we begin with the 5-d lagrangian for a single massless fermion interacting with a real background scalar field .",
    "the fifth dimension is compact with support @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "the generalization to the case with different families of fermions is straightforward . @xmath4",
    "it is important that this lagrangian is invariant under a @xmath1 symmetry @xmath5 @xmath6 to obtain the chiral zero mode for fermions as they are in the sm , it is necessary to compactify the 5-d theory on an @xmath0 orbifold through the imposition of the following relations on the fields @xmath7 @xmath8 which constrain the fermion left - handed component and the scalar wavefunctions to be antisymmetric , and the fermion right - handed component to be symmetric at the orbifold fixed points @xmath9 .",
    "this in turn gives rise to a stable and non - constant vev solution for the background scalar field when @xmath10 is sufficiently large ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 characterizes the extent of the brane in the transverse direction , to which standard model chiral quarks are going to be confined .",
    "clearly , vev kink - antikink approximation ( [ compositesol ] ) holds only for @xmath14 . after performing a chiral decomposition",
    "@xmath15 one obtains the massless ( zero - mode ) fermion wavefunctions satisfying the motion equation associated with lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) @xmath16 } \\",

    "now let us mention some important properties of these zero - mode solutions which are relevant to the present work .",
    "first , both solutions ( [ solr ] ) and ( [ soll ] ) are symmetric at the orbifold fixed points @xmath19 , so the right component survives and the left component vanishes by contradiction with the orbifold boundary conditions ( [ obcpsi ] ) assuring the single - handedness of sm fermions . by inverting the sign of @xmath20 in ( [ z2psi ] )",
    "one can change the chirality of the surviving fermion .",
    "second , the sign of the yukawa coupling @xmath21 decides the localization position of the surviving chiral zero - mode fermions along the extra dimension ; if @xmath22 it is @xmath23 , if @xmath24 it is @xmath25 .",
    "localizing fermions at an arbitrary location other than the two fixed points in the bulk requires additional extensions of the lagrangian such as odd - mass terms @xcite or two background scalar fields @xcite . in the next section , sticking just to the minimal localization mechanism , we exhaust all possibilities of placing different @xmath26 representations @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 at the two fixed points and find that , in all configurations , this is indeed sufficient to obtain the right quark mass spectrum and ckm matrix .",
    "remarkably , this minimal localization mechanism also features a democratic structure for the quark mass matrices , because fields of identical @xmath30 gauge symmetry ( @xmath31 s , @xmath32 s or @xmath33 s ) are localized at the same point along the extra dimension .",
    "small deviations from a democratic mass matrix , which is necessary in any realistic model , are realized in our approach by slightly modifying the fermions wavefunctions .",
    "third , in the difference with other works in literature , here we make use of the exact solution for the zero - mode wavefunctions ( [ solr ] ) , ( [ soll ] ) in place of a gaussian profile approximation .      in the spirit of sm , we now introduce three @xmath26 doublets @xmath34 and six @xmath26 singlets @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) whose zero modes are identified respectively with the sm quark chiral components @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 after orbifold compactification .",
    "the higgs doublet zero mode is assumed to be uniform along transverse direction ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "we construct a general 5-d lagrangian concerning three fermion families @xmath42 in order to obtain a ppmm in 4-d effective theory , we use the following ansatz for 5-d yukawa couplings @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 real positive .",
    "we note in particular in the above ansatz that complex higher - dimensional yukawa couplings have universal absolute values @xmath46 , @xmath47 for both up and down sector , and family symmetry is broken only in the phases .",
    "the difference between @xmath48 and @xmath49 to eventually give rise to the up - down quark mass hierarchy can also be accommodated conveniently in the brane picture with more extra dimensions ( section iic ) .",
    "the sm quarks obtain masses via spontaneous symmetry breaking with the higgs developing a vev @xmath50 ( note that sm chiral fields @xmath51 and @xmath52 have identical extra - dimensional wavefunctions because they originally come from the same doublet in higher - dimensional theory ) , the higgs zero mode is the only mode that receives non - zero vev @xcite ] @xmath53 + h.c .",
    "\\ , ,          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54    with real , dimensionless effective couplings @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "one has to notice that a pure - phase structure for the matrices @xmath57 and @xmath58 arises when the left - handed zero mode of @xmath34 are localized at the same position along the extra dimension independently of the family index @xmath59 and the same happens for the right - handed zero mode of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "then as it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ massupnew ] ) and ( [ massdownnew ] ) the elements of each matrix differ only by a phase factor .",
    "we first perform the usual transformation from gauge eigenbasis to mass eigenbasis @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 diagonalize respectively the matrices ( @xmath63 ) , ( @xmath64 ) @xmath65 and whose product gives the ckm matrix @xmath66 the origin of cp violation in weak interaction is related to the phase appearing in the ckm matrix , which by virtue of above relations comes from the complexity of mass matrices ( it is well - known that real mass matrices do not give rise to cp violation ) .",
    "the localization mechanism in 5-d theory clearly provides a direct control over the modulus of each mass matrix element , but it does nothing to their phases .",
    "that is , a priori @xmath57 and @xmath58 may possess in total 18 arbitrary phases @xmath67 , @xmath68 . in the present work , stemming from the interest in model s simplicity , we just attribute four phases @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 to elements of @xmath57 ( say @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) and @xmath58 ( say @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) .",
    "one can note here that hermitian matrices ( @xmath63 ) and ( @xmath64 ) have altogether six phases , but two of them are non - physical and can be eliminated by a simultaneous transformation involving a single diagonal phase matrix @xmath77 @xcite @xmath78 now the 4 physical phases left in @xmath63 , @xmath64 can be reproduced by the chosen configuration with four phases in @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",

    ", the solution satisfying the quark mass ratios and the ckm matrix can not be obtained @xcite .",
    "further , if these phases are small enough , the mass matrices structure transforms from almost pure - phase @xmath84 to almost democratic @xmath85 .",
    "all our numerical solutions obtained below indeed clearly reflects this democratic structure .",
    "one very important advantage of a dmm is that it has three eigenvalues of `` loose hierarchy '' : ( 0 , 0 , @xmath86 ) , and by slightly modifying the mass matrix elements from `` 1 '' one can reproduce the right mass spectrum and right ckm matrix . more specifically , because small differences in @xmath87 s and @xmath88 s induce small modification in the corresponding wavefunction profiles @xmath89 s , eqs .",
    "( [ elementmu ] ) , ( [ elementmd ] ) , to recover realistic quark masses we will attribute different values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 to different flavors ( the quartic coupling @xmath92 is kept universal )",
    ". meanwhile we preserve essential democratic structure by localizing fields from each of the three groups ( doublets , up and down - type singlets ) at the same point along the extra dimension regardless of family index . choosing identical signs for @xmath93 ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) for different indices @xmath59",
    "one can fulfill this requirement .",
    "our approach hence is different from that of @xcite where wavefunctions of different chiral flavors are very carefully and distinctly constructed in the bulk so that their overlaps render the correct mass spectrum .",
    "however , associated ckm matrix found therein does not generate sufficient cp violation as to the level it is observed in meson rare decays , ( as long as the model has only one extra dimensions ) , even when one assigns to each mass matrix element an arbitrary phase @xcite . in the present work",
    "a dmm structure will be the key point to overcome this difficulty .      with the model with just one extra dimension presented in the previous sections",
    ", one can fit quark mass spectrum and ckm matrix all by twisting around the pure - phase and democratic structures of mass matrices .",
    "we in particular have employed two different 5-d yukawa couplings @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( @xmath96 , sections iv - v ) to generate up - down quark mass hierarchy , whose nature was not seen directly within the framework of 5-d theory . in this subsection , for the purpose of completeness",
    ", we briefly mention a possible solution to this issue , which consists of adding another spatial dimension to the theory .",
    "beginning with six - dimensional model , we can repeat the orbifold compactification procedure for the two extra dimensions , one after the other , to secure the single - chirality of zero modes . we choose to localize all doublets identically along the sixth dimension ( the same holds for up - type and down - type singlets ) . in the result , the 5-d ( now effective ) yukawa coupling @xmath97 ( @xmath98 )",
    "are just the product of 6-d couplings @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) and the @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) wavefunction overlap along the sixth dimension .",
    "so by starting with a single yukawa coupling ( @xmath103 ) in 6-d theory , we can end up with two different 5-d couplings because @xmath28 and @xmath29 fields have been placed differently from @xmath27 fields along the sixth dimension .",
    "further , the phases of mass matrices elements could also be generated from 6-d models ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "rather , the point we would like to emphasize here is that , extra dimension theory can potentially provide necessary ingredients to reproduce 4-d effective theory of particle interaction .",
    "in this section we present the parameter space for the particular choice of the model considered with 24 parameters .",
    "also if the number of parameters is large , what has to be said here is that the `` naturality '' of the parameters , ( generally all the values are of order one or differ by no more than one order of magnitude ) , we believe , is the most important factor , and the parameter space found satisfies this condition .",
    "the list of the parameters is the following :    * @xmath104 and @xmath105 * @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , with @xmath37 are dimensionless quantities whose inverse is proportional to the thickness of the domain wall . * @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 with @xmath37 and @xmath21 s being the yukawa couplings appearing in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) * @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are the phases appearing respectively in the up and down mass matrices    as it can be seen from this particular choice of the parameter space , we decided to break family symmetry by choosing different values for @xmath91 and @xmath112 for different indices @xmath59 ( toghether with four different phases @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 appearing in the mass matrices ) , and at the same time to break the left - right symmetry by different values for the left component parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 and the right component parameters @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "in this section we present the numerical results obtained for the parameter space and for the physical quantities of table 1 .",
    "we consider four different cases , which correspond to the all four possible ways of picking the sign of the yukawa couplings @xmath21 for the left and right components .",
    "the four different cases are the following :    * @xmath123 denoted as @xmath124 * @xmath125 denoted as @xmath126 * @xmath127 denoted as @xmath128 * @xmath129 denoted as @xmath130    the first case corresponds to the doublets , up and down - type singlets all localized at the orbifold fixed point @xmath23 .",
    "the second case corresponds to the doublets and up - type singlets localized at @xmath23 , while the down - type singlets at @xmath25 .",
    "the third case corresponds to the doublets and down - type singlets localized at @xmath23 , while the up - type singlets at @xmath25 .",
    "and finally the fourth case corresponds to the doublets localized at @xmath23 , while both the up and down - type singlets at @xmath25 .",
    "the other four possible cases obtained when one changes at the same time all the signs of the yukawa couplings are just symmetrical to the four presented , with each wave function now localized at the other orbifold fixed point , and with symmetrical profile .",
    "so they do not present any new mixing pattern .",
    "the approach we use to derive the parameter space consists in minimizing a particular function , built in such a way that its global minima correspond to the region defined by the experimental constraints .",
    "this function is defined as :    @xmath131    where @xmath132 is the step function , n is the number of quantities that we want to fit , @xmath133 is the predicted value for the @xmath134 quantity , @xmath135 and @xmath136 fix the range for the @xmath134 quantity , and @xmath137 is its average value .",
    "it is immediate to verify from eq .",
    "( [ ee ] ) that when all the predicted quantities @xmath133 s are contained in the proper ranges , the function @xmath138 takes its minimum value equal to zero .",
    "the set of parameters which correspond to a zero value for the function @xmath138 is called a solution .",
    "the minimization procedure we used is called simulated annealing @xcite@xcite , and when the function that we want to minimize depends on many parameters , this procedure seems to work more efficiently than others . in particular",
    "the simulated annealing method is mostly used when the global minima are surrounded by a lot of local minima . in fact this minimization process can find a global minimum also after being trapped in a local minimum .    in the following we will present the numerical results for each of the cases mentioned above .",

[ figure_13 ] ) .",
    "in this case the deviation from a pure democratic mass matrix for the up sector is bigger than the one for the down sector .",
    "as we will show in the next section this is also the only case for which we were able to find solutions for the 15 parameter version of the model .",
    "the forth case where the doublets and up - type singlets are at the same orbifold fixed point while the down - type singlets are at the other orbifold fixed point @xmath126 gives for the top - quark mass a very narrow value - region around @xmath217 ( fig .",
    "[ figure_8 ] ) . in this case",
    "the mass matrix for the up sector is very close to a pure democratic mass matrix while the deviation from it is larger for the down sector .",

    "in this section we present the results for another particular choice of the model with 15 parameters , which correspond to all the yukawa couplings with the same absolute value , @xmath218 .",
    "the family symmetry and left - right symmetry are now broken only through the parameters @xmath88 s and phases @xmath219 s .",

    "the fact that we found solutions only for one of the four possible cases does not obviously exclude completely the existence of solutions for the other three cases , but we believe that we can at least conclude that the configuration @xmath220 is favored respect to the others .    in the following",

    "what has to be also noticed is that the 15 parameter case favors a small top mass ( fig .",
    "[ figure_23 ] ) , on the contrary to the 24 parameter corresponding case @xmath128 which gives a much larger range for the top - quark mass .",
    "we suggest that using one extra dimension compactified on an @xmath237 orbifold one is able to produce an almost democratic mass matrix and obtain the right mass spectrum and right ckm matrix . in the model",
    "presented the zero modes are localized only at the orbifold fixed points and different profiles for the zero mode wave functions are allowed .",
    "we show that in the case of the 24 parameter version of the model , for all four possible scenarios to localize the left and right handed components of quarks at one or the other orbifold fixed point , we were able to fit the mass spectrum and ckm matrix . on the other hand in the case of the 15 parameter version of the model , which corresponds to having the universal absolute value of the yukawa couplings with the background scalar field for the different fermion families , we were able to reproduce the right mass spectrum and right ckm only in the case with the doublets and down - type singlets localized at one orbifold fixed point and the up - type singlets at the other orbifold fixed point .",
