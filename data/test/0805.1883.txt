    "the twist of the solar magnetic field plays an important role in transient phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections , and in the dynamo processes that cause the 11-year solar activity cycle . the magnetic twist can be measured in various ways .",
    "magnetic helicity is an integral that quantifies topological complexity of field lines , such as linking , twist , or kinking ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for a closed magnetic system it is defined by @xmath0 , and alternative definitions",
    "have been developed for open systems @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we consider current helicity , which we define as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the magnetic field and @xmath3 is the current density .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 has the advantage that it describes the _ local _ distribution of twist and shear in the magnetic field , and that it is more readily determined from limited observational data than @xmath5 which requires global information . for a force - free field ( @xmath6 )",
    "we have @xmath7 and @xmath4 , which may be a function of space , is a fundamental parameter that describes the torsion of the field lines around one another .",
    "note that we shall not consider the _ integral _ current helicity @xmath8 because unlike @xmath5 it is not a near - conserved quantity in mhd @xcite , and it does not even in general take the same sign as @xmath5 ( except for linear force - free fields where @xmath4 is constant in space and @xmath4 , @xmath9 , and @xmath5 all have the same sign , * ? ? ?",
    "there are two main techniques for estimating @xmath4 from observed vector magnetograms , which so far only cover a small region of the solar surface such as a single active region :    1 .",
    "compute @xmath10 and hence @xmath11 , which should give @xmath4 exactly for a force - free field @xcite .",
    "2 .   compute a linear force - free extrapolation from @xmath12 and choose the overall value , @xmath13 , which best reproduces the observed @xmath14 , @xmath15 distribution over the region @xcite .",
    "the studies by @xcite and @xcite show that both techniques are generally consistent .",
    "the key result of these observations is a robust hemispheric rule whereby the average @xmath4 value is negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in the southern hemisphere , although there is significant scatter including a mixture of signs of @xmath4 within single active regions .",
    "this hemispheric pattern in @xmath4 has also been found by @xcite who reconstructed the radial and toroidal components of the global magnetic field under simplifying assumptions .",
    "a trans - equatorial sign change in helicity is supported by numerous proxy observations such as h@xmath4 images of active region structure @xcite , _ in situ _ heliospheric measurements @xcite , differential rotation @xcite , and filament / prominence magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "using newly - developed simulations of the global coronal evolution , we have recently been able to reproduce the filament hemispheric pattern including exceptions ( with 96% agreement ) , in a comparison with 109 observed filaments @xcite . in this letter",
    "we describe the distribution of current helicity in a 30-month simulation , which we hope to compare with new magnetic observations from the sdo ( nasa solar dynamics observatory ) mission .",
    "our simulations of the 3d coronal field evolution @xcite use the coupled flux transport and magnetofrictional model of @xcite , in a domain extending from @xmath16 to @xmath17 in longitude , @xmath18 to @xmath19 in latitude , and @xmath20 to @xmath21 in radius .",
    "the coronal magnetic field @xmath22 evolves _ via _ the non - ideal induction equation @xmath23 in response to flux emergence and advection by large - scale motions on the photospheric boundary . rather than solve the full mhd system we approximate the momentum equation by the magnetofrictional method @xcite , setting @xmath24 this artificial velocity ensures evolution through a sequence of near force - free states .",
    "the second term is a radial outflow imposed only near to the upper boundary , where it simulates the effect of the solar wind in opening up field lines in the radial direction @xcite .",
    "the diffusivity @xmath25 consists of a uniform background term and an enhancement in regions of strong current density @xmath26 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the photospheric boundary conditions are described in @xcite ; the surface flux transport model includes newly emerging magnetic bipoles based on active regions observed in synoptic normal - component magnetograms from nso , kitt peak .",
    "the emerging bipoles take a simple mathematical form , with properties chosen to match the location , size , tilt , and magnetic flux of the observed regions .",
    "they are inserted in 3d with a non - zero twist ( magnetic helicity ) , chosen to match the observed sign of helicity in each hemisphere .",
    "the simulation illustrated in this letter models 30 months of continuous evolution during the rising phase of cycle 23 ( from 1997 april 9 to 1999 october 10 , rotations cr1921 to cr1954 ) . from an initial potential field extrapolation , the photospheric and coronal fields were evolved forward continuously for 914 days with 396 new bipoles inserted during this time .",
    "two example snapshots of the simulated magnetic field are shown in figure [ fig : field ] .",
    "to illustrate the sources of current helicity in our simulation within an individual active region , figure [ fig : single ] zooms in to a bipole in the northern hemisphere which emerged on day 136 ( as measured from the start of the simulation ) .",
    "there are three main sources of coronal currents and helicity in our model :    1 .",
    "the new bipoles emerge twisted .",
    "this twist is initially concentrated low down in the centre of the bipole , as seen from the field lines in figure [ fig : single](a ) which are skewed as they cross the bipole s central polarity inversion line ( pil ) .",
    "the sigmoidal concentration of negative @xmath4 at the centre of the bipole is clearly seen on day 140 in figure [ fig : single](b ) .",
    "when the bipoles emerge they displace older fields and produce currents at the interface between old and new flux systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : single](b ) this is visible at the nw edge of the new bipole where it adjoins a pre - existing bipole , and a layer of positive @xmath4 has developed .",
    "note that this is opposite in sign to that from the twist of the new region , as seen in figure [ fig : single](a ) .",
    "this corresponds to field lines that are oppositely skewed at this edge of the new bipole , as compared to those across the central pil .",
    "this is just one example of how both signs of @xmath4 may naturally be produced within a single active region , as found in observations .",
    "3 .   over time , surface motions shear the coronal field generating further currents .",
    "this is visible in figure [ fig : single](c ) , which shows the distribution of @xmath4 for the same region on day 190 , after 50 days evolution .",
    "there is a significant build - up of negative @xmath4 , particularly at the north and south ends of the bipole where helicity was initially low .",
    "this build - up is caused by differential rotation and convergence ( due to supergranular diffusion ) .",
    "in addition to these sources of current helicity , it may also be locally reduced by diffusive cancellation and reconnection .",
    "also , helicity is periodically removed through the top boundary of the domain when excessive build - up of twist leads to localised temporary losses of equilibrium , and the ejection of twisted flux ropes @xcite .",
    "the global distribution of current helicity , @xmath4 , is shown in figure [ fig : global ] at days 10 , 100 , and 910 of the simulation . from the initial potential field on day 0 ( with @xmath27 everywhere ) , a pattern of intermixed positive and negative @xmath4 has developed by day 10 , simply due to photospheric shearing  this is before the first active region emergence .",
    "after about 100 days , a clear latitudinal trend in @xmath4 emerges , although there is still significant local variation in both strength and sign .",
    "this pattern persists for the rest of the simulation , and up to medium heights in the 3d corona ( nearer the top of the computational box high values of @xmath4 become localized to closed field regions , with @xmath28 where the field is open ) .    in figures [ fig : global](a ) , ( e ) , and ( f )",
    ", it can be seen how the mean @xmath4 at low latitudes ( @xmath16 to about @xmath29 ) develops into the observed hemispheric trend , although with considerable scatter as observed on the real sun .",
    "however , at high latitudes the sign of @xmath4 is reversed .",
    "these polar reversals correspond to the east - west pils at the polar crown boundaries , and move steadily poleward through the simulation as the polar crowns reduce in size towards polar field reversal ( we are approaching solar maximum ) .",
    "this opposite sign of @xmath4 is caused by differential rotation of the predominantly north - south field lines at this latitude , and is a well - documented problem for theoretical models @xcite . at lower latitudes , as was illustrated by figure [ fig : single](c ) , differential rotation of north - south pils produces the observed hemispheric sign of helicity @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : global ] shows mean values of @xmath4 at active latitudes of the order @xmath30 . the actual maximum and minimum values recorded on day 910 of the simulation were @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "a key result of this study is that these values are much higher than those estimated from linear force - free extrapolations .",
    "such solutions suffer a constraint on the maximum @xmath4 in order to obtain a decay with height @xcite , requiring that @xmath33 ( the `` first resonant value '' ) , where @xmath34 is the horizontal length of the periodic box .",
    "the linear force - free model of an observed filament by @xcite has @xmath35 , and for the solutions of @xcite this first resonant value was at @xmath36 .",
    "by contrast , studies using nonlinear force - free extrapolations from vector magnetograms using the grad - rubin type method @xcite find locally higher values of @xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they are also more realistic because they allow variable @xmath4 within a single region , as in our simulations . for a particular active region",
    ", @xcite found maximum values of the order @xmath37 , consistent with the results of our simulations .",
    "in this letter we have shown how our 3d simulations of the global coronal magnetic field evolution are able to model the development and transport of current helicity , @xmath4 , over many solar rotations .",
    "we find a clear latitudinal pattern of @xmath4 that persists throughout the simulation , although locally within single bipoles there is significant scatter and intermixing of both signs of @xmath4 , in agreement with observations .",
    "local values may be much higher than those predicted by linear force - free extrapolations .    with existing measurements of @xmath4 limited to vector magnetograms of individual active regions , robust observations of the latitudinal distribution of @xmath4 await full - disk vector magnetograms",
    ". these will shortly be available from the nasa solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) satellite .",
    "in particular the hmi ( helioseismic and magnetic imager ) instrument will provide synoptic full - disk vector magnetograms at 1  resolution and approximately @xmath38 cadence .",
    "this will offer an exciting opportunity to test and refine our theoretical model for the coronal magnetic field .",
    "in particular , consistent measurements over a large portion of the solar cycle will allow us to consider how the helicity distribution varies over both space and time .    whether there is a systematic variation in the latitudinal trend of helicity over the solar cycle",
    "remains an unresolved issue @xcite , and has implications for the sub - surface origin of helicity @xcite .",
    "indeed @xcite showed that observations of @xmath4 in active regions provide important constraints on theories of the solar dynamo itself ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "ejection of helical fields from the corona , as included in our simulations , is also thought to play an important role in sustaining the solar cycle @xcite .",
    "a particular feature of our results is the sign reversal of current helicity at the high - latitude polar crowns .",
    "this would appear to be in conflict with observations of magnetic fields in polar crown filaments , which show no such reversal in their chirality pattern @xcite .",
    "we hope to address this outstanding issue in longer simulations covering a greater portion of the solar cycle .",
    "it is not at present clear whether longer - term poleward transport of the correct sign of helicity will be enough to counteract the effect of differential rotation on the north - south oriented field lines at these latitudes .",
    "observations of vector magnetic fields in the polar regions , such as those being made by _ hinode _ @xcite and soon the sdo mission , should help to constrain our models .",
    "financial support for ary and dhm was provided by the uk stfc .",
    "dhm and aavb would also like to thank the issi in bern for support .",
    "the simulations were performed on the ukmhd parallel computer in st andrews , funded jointly by srif / stfc .",
    "synoptic magnetogram data from nso / kitt peak was produced cooperatively by nsf / noao , nasa / gsfc , and noaa / sel and made publicly accessible on the world wide web ."
