    "chern - simons quantum field theory in 3-dimensions ( perturbative , or non - perturbative ) produces a plethora of numerical invariants of knotted 3-dimensional objects .",
    "we introduce a packaging of these invariants into two power series : one that encodes non - perturbative invariants ( model np ) , and one that encodes perturbative invariants ( model p ) . the paper is concerned with the analytic continuation , the asymptotic behavior and and arithmetic properties of those power series .",
    "let us begin with a conjecture concerning the structure of nonperturbative quantum invariants . consider the generating series    @xmath0    of the _ witten - reshetikhin - turaev _",
    "invariants @xmath1 ( see section [ sec.cs ] ) of a closed , oriented , connected 3-manifold @xmath2 , using a compact lie group @xmath3 and a level @xmath4 . the power series is known to be convergent inside the unit disk @xmath5 since unitarity implies that @xmath1 grows at most polynomially with respect to @xmath6 ; see @xcite .",
    "( analytic continuation ) for every pair @xmath7 as above , the series @xmath8 has analytic continuation as a multivalued function on @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a finite set that contains zero and the exponentials of the negative of the critical values of the complexified chern - simons action .",
    "a key observation is that @xmath11 may contain elements inside the unit disk @xmath12 despite the fact that the power series @xmath8 is analytic for @xmath13 such that @xmath12 .",
    "one may compare this behavior with the power series @xmath14 that define the classical dilogarithm , whose analytic continuation is a multivalued analytic function in @xmath15 .",
    "schematically , the analytic continuation of @xmath8 may be depicted as follows :    @xmath16    the above conjecture has the following features :    * it can be formulated for pairs @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes a knotted object , i.e. , a knot @xmath19 in 3-space or a closed 3-manifold @xmath2 and @xmath3 denotes a compact lie group . *",
    "it implies via elementary complex analysis two well - known asymptotic conjectures in quantum topology ; namely the volume conjecture ( in the case of knots ) , and the witten conjecture ( in the case of 3-manifolds ) .",
    "the complex analysis argument uses the cauchy formula to write @xmath1 as a contour integral of @xmath20 and then deform the contour around the singularities of the integrand nearest to the origin . for a detailed discussion , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.7 ) .",
    "* it states a precise relation between exact chern - simons theory and its perturbation expansion around a trivial ( or not ) flat connection .",
    "namely , perturbation theory is simply the expansion of the multivalued function @xmath8 around one of its singularities . *",
    "it explains the effect of complexifying a compact gauge group and to the partition function of the corresponding gauge theory .",
    "indeed , analytic continuation captures the critical values of the complexified action ; compare also with @xcite . *",
    "the conjecture can be extended to state - sum invariants of sum - product type that generalize @xmath1 and do not necessarily come from topology .",
    "* the conjecture has been proven for power series of 1-dimensional sum - product type , which includes the case of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 knots ; see @xcite and @xcite . *",

    "* sec.1.3 ) . * in analysis one may use the above symmetry to deduce the asymptotic behavior ( and even more , the asymptotic expansion ) of @xmath8 for large @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath32 , it follows that @xmath33 for large @xmath31 . *",
    "the above symmetry may be explained by the fact that cs changes sign under orientation reversal .",
    "since the level is nonnegative , the path integral formula for @xmath8 formally implies the above symmetry . *",

    "based on some partial results of @xcite and @xcite and stimulating conversations with o. costin , j. calle and d. zagier , more is actually expected to be true .",
    "namely , we expect arithmetic restrictions on the singularities of the series @xmath8 and of its monodromy , local and global .",

    "formally , for @xmath4 , @xmath1 is the expectation value of a _ path integral _ with a topological _ chern - simons lagrangian _ at level @xmath6 ; see @xcite .",
    "since the chern - simons lagrangian takes values in @xmath56 , it follows that the level @xmath6 has to be an integer number , which without loss we take it to be nonnegative .",
    "we can convert the sequence @xmath57 into a generating series as follows :    for every @xmath2 and @xmath3 as above , we define : @xmath58    unitarity of the chern - simons theory implies that for every @xmath59 the sequence @xmath57 grows polynomially with respect to @xmath6 . in other words , it was shown in @xcite that there exists positive constant @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( that depend on @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) so that @xmath62 for all @xmath4 .",
    "thus , @xmath8 is analytic inside the unit disk @xmath63 .",
    "the path integral interpretation of @xmath1 formally leads to a perturbation theory along a distinguished critical point of the chern - simons action , namely the trivial flat connection .",
    "this gives rise to a graph - valued power series invariant , which has been defined by le - murakami - ohtsuki in @xcite .",

    "let us recall those briefly , and refer the reader to @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "let us fix a closed 3-manifold @xmath2 , and simple , compact simply connected group @xmath3 , and a trivial bundle @xmath74 with the trivial connection @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath76 denote the set of @xmath3-connections on @xmath74 .",

    "in other words , we may identify :    @xmath81    this gives rise to a map :    @xmath82    stokes s theorem implies that @xmath80 is a locally constant map . since @xmath79 is a compact set , @xmath80 takes finitely many values in @xmath83 .",
    "let us now _ complexify _ the action ; see also @xcite .",

    "there are exact and numerical computer implementations for the critical values of @xmath86 : see snap @xcite and @xcite .",
    "complexification also reveals the arithmetic structure of @xmath104 : its elements are _ periods _ of weight @xmath105 ( in the sense of kontsevich - zagier @xcite ) , of a rather special kind .",
