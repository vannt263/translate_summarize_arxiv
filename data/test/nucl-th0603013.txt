    "quasielastic nucleon knockout reactions have been extensively investigated with the aim of obtaining precise information on nuclear structure .",

    "the incoming proton undergoes `` soft '' initial - state interactions with the target before knocking out a bound proton through the primary high - momentum - transfer @xmath11 scattering .",
    "both the scattered and the ejected proton suffer final - state interactions while leaving the nucleus . the scattered and the ejected proton are detected in coincidence , while the residual nucleus remains unobserved.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in quasielastic @xmath0 scattering the projectile is elastically scattered from a single bound nucleon in the target nucleus , resulting in the struck nucleon being knocked out of the target nucleus .",
    "this relatively simple reaction mechanism of one `` hard '' nucleon - nucleon collision is obscured by the `` soft '' initial- and final - state interactions ( ifsi ) of the incident and two outgoing nucleons with the nuclear medium .",
    "consequently , every model for @xmath8 and @xmath9 reactions has two issues to address  : first , the description of the `` hard '' wide - angle scattering that leads to the ejection of the struck nucleon and second , the distorting mechanisms of the `` soft '' small - angle ifsi .",
    "concerning the treatment of the `` hard '' @xmath12 scattering part , essentially two methods exist .",
    "a so - called `` cross - section factorized '' approximation @xcite can be adopted so that the nucleon - nucleon scattering cross section enters as a multiplicative factor in the differential @xmath0 cross section .",
    "some results of exclusive @xmath8 measurements interpreted with this cross - section factorized form can be found in refs .",
    "the inclusion of spin - dependence in the description of the ifsi , however , breaks this factorization scheme .",
    "in that situation an alternative technique can be used  : the amplitude factorized form of the cross section @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the two - body @xmath12 interaction can be approximated by the interpolation of phase shifts @xcite from free elastic @xmath12 scattering .",
    "various phenomenological forms to fit the amplitudes have also been used in the past .",
    "traditionally , the nucleon - nucleon scattering matrix has been parametrized in terms of five lorentz invariants @xcite , a method usually dubbed as the ia1 model or the spvat ( scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , axial vector , tensor ) form of the @xmath12 scattering matrix .",
    "differential cross section calculations adopting these five - term representations have been reported in refs  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that although the spvat form gives reasonable predictions of @xmath0 observables , it is , in principle , not correct , as a five - term parametrization of the relativistic @xmath12 scattering matrix is inherently ambiguous @xcite .",
    "tjon and wallace @xcite have shown that a complete expansion of the @xmath12 scattering matrix ( commonly called the ia2 model ) contains @xmath13 independent invariant amplitudes . to date , the only calculations employing this general lorentz invariant representation have been performed in the context of the relativistic plane wave impulse approximation ( rpwia ) , i.e. , a model which ignores all ifsi mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the ifsi effects are typically computed by means of the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) theoretical framework @xcite .",
    "generally , in a dwia approach the scattering wave functions of the incoming and two outgoing nucleons are generated by solving the schrdinger or dirac equation with complex optical potentials .",
    "parametrizations for these optical potentials are usually not gained from basic grounds , but are obtained by fitting elastic nucleon - nucleus scattering data .",
    "several optical - potential parameter sets @xcite have been used in the description of quasifree proton scattering off nuclei . in the past ,",
    "both nonrelativistic and relativistic dwia versions have proven successful in predicting @xmath0 cross sections over a wide energy range ( @xmath14@xmath15  mev ) and for a whole scope of target nuclei .",
    "most of the available calculations for the exclusive @xmath0 process addressed incident proton kinetic energies of a few hundred mev . in this work we aim at extending the formalism to scattering in the gev energy regime .",
    "as a matter of fact , the majority of dwia frameworks rely on partial - wave expansions of the exact solution to the scattering problem , an approach which becomes increasingly cumbersome at higher energies . in this energy range",
    "the eikonal approximation @xcite , which belongs to the class of high - energy semiclassical methods , offers a valid alternative for describing the ifsi .",
    "nonrelativistic eikonal studies of the @xmath8 reaction used in combination with optical potentials can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a relativistic and cross - section factorized formalism based on the eikonal approximation for computing exclusive @xmath0 cross sections at incident proton energies in the few hundred mev to gev range .",
    "the eikonal formalism is implemented relativistically in combination with optical potentials @xcite , as well as with glauber theory @xcite , which is a multiple - scattering extension of the eikonal approximation .",
    "the two frameworks only differ in the way they treat the ifsi",

    ", it can be inferred from the picture that the isi effects increase with growing @xmath171 for @xmath177 . for @xmath178 and increasing @xmath171 , initially , the growing distance the proton has to travel through the nucleus leads to a decrease of the real part of @xmath100 .",
    "this is followed by an increase for larger @xmath171 up to @xmath179 .",
    "this reduction in isi effects with increasing @xmath171 is brought about by the incoming proton s path through the nucleus moving away from the nuclear interior and closer to the less dense nuclear surface .",
    "the other curves of the upper left figure illustrate a general trend for @xmath180  : as @xmath171 increases , the real part of the ifsi factor grows correspondingly . as can be appreciated from fig .",
    "[ fig : re.40ca.n.edai.phi0.radial ] as well as from the previous figures , the global behavior of the @xmath101 factor describing the scattered proton s fsi can be related to that of the isi factor @xmath100 through the substitution @xmath181 .",
    "this approximate symmetry can be attributed to the small scattering angle @xmath139 , i.e. , the scattered proton leaves the nucleus almost parallel to the incoming proton s direction . in the bottom left panel , the additional curve ( @xmath182 , i.e. , close to @xmath176 ) represents the situation of maximal fsi of the ejected nucleon . for this @xmath169 value , the path of the ejected nucleon passes through the center of the nucleus and the distance travelled through the nucleus increases with @xmath171 .",
    "accordingly , the real part of @xmath102 is a monotonously decreasing function of @xmath171 .",
    "the other extreme is the @xmath183 case where increasing @xmath171 means less fsi . for the other @xmath169 values",
    ", the absorption reaches its maximum for some intermediate @xmath171 value .",
    "again , the combination of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 determines the total ifsi factor with the strongest attenuation predicted in the nuclear interior .",
    "the dependence of the ifsi factor on the azimuthal angle of the collision point is quite straightforward .",
    "one representative result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : re.16o.p.edad2.r3fm.3d ] . here , @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) refers to a situation where the `` hard '' @xmath12 collision occurs in the upper ( lower ) hemisphere with respect to the @xmath186-plane ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : geometry ] for a collision point located in the upper hemisphere ) . due to the cylindrical symmetry about the @xmath120-axis ,",
    "the factor describing the isi of the incoming proton is independent of @xmath170 .",
    "regarding the scattered proton , we observe the least fsi in the upper hemisphere , since the proton then avoids passing through the highly absorbing nuclear interior . for the ejected nucleon",
    ", the contrary applies and the strongest fsi effects are found for @xmath187 . as the @xmath188-plane is defined as the scattering plane , the ifsi factor possesses the symmetry @xmath189 for coplanar scattering .",
    "results for the emission from levels other than the fermi level have not been plotted here , as it turns out that the ifsi factors hardly depend on the single - particle level in which the struck nucleon resides .",

    "( [ eq : dist_mom_space_wave_fctn ] ) is determined by the values of the ifsi factor folded with a relativistic bound - state wave function @xmath191 .",
    "as the particles experience less ifsi close to the nuclear surface , one obtains a stronger reduction of the quasifree cross section for nucleon knockout from a level which has a larger fraction of its density in the nuclear interior .",
    "this will become apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_r ] , but even more so in sec .",
    "[ sec : pnpi ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : delta_r ] shows a function @xmath192 which represents the contribution of the nuclear region with radial coordinate @xmath171 to the differential cross section .",
    "the procedure to calculate this function is similar to the method exposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and is developed in appendix  [ app : radial_contrib ] .",
    "comparison of the upper and lower panels illustrates that ifsi mechanisms make the @xmath8 cross sections reflect surface mechanisms , unlike the @xmath193 reaction where the weakly interacting electron probes the entire nuclear volume and only the outgoing proton interacts with the residual system .",
    "apart from the shift to higher @xmath171 , the ifsi brings about a strong reduction in the magnitude of the cross sections , whereby the fermi level is least affected .",
    "even though @xmath192 is concentrated in the surface region , the average density seen through this reaction still amounts to @xmath194  @xmath195 ( @xmath196  @xmath195 ) or @xmath197 ( @xmath198 ) of the central density in the case of @xmath199 knockout from @xmath2c ( @xmath4ca ) . in the case of emission from the fermi level ,",
    "on the other hand , the average density is only @xmath200 ( @xmath201 ) of the central density for a @xmath2c ( @xmath4ca ) target .",
    "also , the ifsi factors for neutron emission are almost identical to the corresponding ifsi factors for proton knockout and , as expected , the overall effect of ifsi is more pronounced for heavier target nuclei .      in this subsection",

    "<S> the authors present a relativistic and cross - section factorized framework for computing quasielastic @xmath0 observables at intermediate and high energies . </S>",
    "<S> the model is based on the eikonal approximation and can accomodate both optical potentials and the glauber method for dealing with the initial- and final - state interactions ( ifsi ) . at lower nucleon energies , </S>",
    "<S> the optical - potential philosophy is preferred , whereas at higher energies the glauber method is more natural . </S>",
    "<S> this versatility in dealing with the ifsi allows one to describe @xmath0 reactions in a wide energy range . </S>",
    "<S> most results presented here use optical potentials as this approach is argued to be the optimum choice for the kinematics of the experiments considered in the present paper . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the ifsi factor , a function wherein the entire effect of the ifsi is contained , are studied in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of the presented framework are compared with two kinematically different experiments . </S>",
    "<S> first , differential cross sections for quasielastic proton scattering at @xmath1  gev off @xmath2c , @xmath3o , and @xmath4ca target nuclei are computed and compared to data from pnpi . </S>",
    "<S> second , the formalism is applied to the analysis of a @xmath5he@xmath6 experiment at @xmath7  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the optical - potential calculations are found to be in good agreement with the data from both experiments , showing the reliability of the adopted model in a wide energy range . </S>"
