    "it is one of the fundamental issue in nuclear physics to evaluate the nuclear matter binding energy and saturation properties , starting from a realistic nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interaction without any adjustment of a free parameter @xcite .",
    "the solution of this problem is of great interest , because the understanding of the binding energy of nuclei is one of the basic problems of nuclear physics and physics in general . because of the presence of strongly repulsive components in the short - range part of the @xmath0 interaction @xcite , the @xmath0 scattering correlation has a predominant importance in the nuclear matter calculation .",
    "the solution of this problem is also very important because the nuclear many - body problem is one of the most challenging testing grounds for many - body theories of quantum systems .",
    "last not least , however , a microscopic understanding of the binding energy of normal nuclei , which is based on a realistic model for the @xmath0 interaction , shall also provide a reliable prediction for the equation of state of nuclear matter at densities beyond the saturation density of normal nuclei , which is required for the study of astrophysical objects like the explosion of supernova and the structure of neutron stars .",
    "recently , various approximation schemes have been developed to describe the correlations which are induced into the many - nucleon wave function by the strong short - range and tensor components of such a realistic @xmath0 force .",
    "for a recent review on such methods see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the resulting correlation functions are the key input for the study of the absorption of real and virtual photons by pairs of nucleons as it is observed in ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) or ( e , @xmath2 @xmath0 ) reactions .",
    "one of the most popular approximation schemes , which is frequently used in nuclear physics , is the brueckner - bethe - goldstone ( bbg ) theory @xcite which has been one of the tools for solving the many - body problem of nuclear matter for many years @xcite .",
    "the results of bhf calculations depend on the choice of the single particle potential , @xmath3 . in the conventional choice ,",
    "@xmath4 for @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the self - consistent bhf potential for @xmath7 . the alternative `` continuous '' choice has been proposed in @xcite for which @xmath6 is again the self - consistent bhf potential , but it extends to @xmath5 .",
    "this continuous choice leads to an enhancement of correlation effects in the medium and tends to predict larger binding energies for nuclear matter than the conventional choice .    in this paper , special attention",
    "will be paid to study the self - consistent self - energy .",
    "note , that all the self - energies in this paper will be calculated self - consistently .",
    "the self - energy of a nucleon contains all the information necessary to obtain occupation probabilities , quasi - particle strength and broadening features which alternatively can be visualized in terms of hole and particle spectral functions .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate whether an improven and more consistent treatment of the many - body system , still based on nonrelativistic dynamics and two - body forces , can provide new information on the saturation problem of nuclear matter . a self - consistent treatment of the green s functions formalism leads to the so called self - consistent green s function ( scgf ) theory @xcite .",
    "attempts have been made to employ the technique of a self - consistent evaluation of green s functions @xcite to the solution of the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "this method offers various advantages : ( i ) the single - particle green s function contains detailed information about the spectral function , i.e. the distribution of single - particle strength , to be observed in nucleon knock - out experiments , as a function of missing energy and momentum .",
    "( ii ) the method can be extended to finite temperatures @xcite , a feature which is of interest for the study of the nuclear properties in astrophysical environments .",
    "( iii ) the bhf approximation , the approximation to the hole - line expansion which is commonly used , can be considered as a specific approximation within this scheme .",
    "attempts have been made to start from the bhf approximation and include the effects of the hole - hole scattering terms in a perturbative way @xcite .",
    "there is a good reason to believe that a more complete treatment of the nucleon self - energy in the full framework of green - function theory will ultimately help resolve long standing questions about nuclear saturation . via this study",
    "we will be able to give an answer to a fundamental question regarding reliability of the bhf theory .",
    "application of scgf theory has proven useful for understanding the location and quantity of single - particle strength found in the electron - scattering experiments .",
    "the focus of this paper is to apply scgf theory to nuclear matter to study the nucleon properties .",
    "after this introduction we will discuss some features of the self - consistent bhf approach for the self - consistent self - energy in sec .",
    "the effect of the hole - hole terms in the self - consistent self - energy and a self - consistent green - function will be presented in sec .",
    "3 . the self - consistent spectral function will be presented in sec .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in the final section .",
    "one of the central equations to be solved in the bhf approximation is the bethe - goldstone equation .",
    "it is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the bare potential , @xmath10 denotes the starting energy , @xmath11 is the pauli operator which requires the nucleon momenta to be outside the fermi sea , e is the sum of the two single - particle energies inside nuclear matter given by @xmath12 with the single particle energies @xmath13 where the self - energy of a nucleon in nuclear matter with momentum @xmath14 is determined by the self - consistent equation @xmath15 with the occupation probability of a free fermi gas with a fermi momentum @xmath16 @xmath17 in the bhf approximation , ( [ eq : betheg ] ) , ( [ eq : bhf1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : selfbhf ] ) are solved self - consistently .    the definition of the single - particle potential or the self - energy can be extended beyond the bhf approximation . in order to discuss such an extension we want to consider various contributions , which are represented by the diagrams or series of diagrams displayed in fig . [ 1 ] .",
    "these terms are summed up in a self - energy as can be written schematically by @xmath18 where the contribution due to two - particle one - hole terms @xmath19 is complex for @xmath20 while the two - hole one - particle term @xmath21 is complex for @xmath22 .",
    "the imaginary part of the bhf self - energy vanishes for @xmath23 .",
    "real and imaginary parts of the self - energy are related to each other by a dispersion relation of the form @xcite + @xmath24 @xmath25    the self - energy of the hartree - fock term is real and independent of @xmath10 .",
    "it is given as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the single particle occupation probability .",
    "the importance of the hartree - fock term is that it represents the simplest solution to the many body problem .",
    "the energy dependence of the real part of the bhf self - consistent self - energy ( see ( [ eq : selfbhf ] ) ) is visualized in figs .",

    "we see that the imaginary part is identical zero for energies @xmath10 less than @xmath31 , as can be seen from ( [ eq : bhf1 ] ) , and yield non - negligible values up to very high energies . although not explicitly shown in figs .",
    "[ 3a ] and [ 3b ] , im@xmath32 vanishes at high energies which is a consequence of the vanishing of the imaginary @xmath33 matrix elements at very large values of the energy parameter .",
    "this result is general for any soft - core interaction , although the softness of the core directly influences the energy for which the matrix elements become negligible . considering the results for the imaginary part of the self - consistent self - energy , which are displayed in figs .",
    "[ 3a ] and [ 3b ] , it is clear from the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disper1 ] ) that the real part of the self - energy is identical to the corresponding hf single - particle potential @xmath34 in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "this real part gets more attractive with increasing @xmath10 until one reaches values of @xmath10 at which the imaginary part is different from zero .",
    "the self - energy turns less attractive at higher energies , which leads to a pronounced minimum at energies @xmath10 slightly above the fermi energy .",
    "the conventional choice has been to ignore self - energy contributions for the particle states completely and approximate the energies by the kinetic energy only .",
    "this conventional choice for the single - particle spectrum , however , is not very appealing as it leads to a gab at the fermi surface : the propagator for single - particle states with momenta below the fermi momentum @xmath36 is described in terms of a bound single - particle energy while the corresponding spectrum for the particle states starts at the kinetic energy for the momentum @xmath36 , so the potential in this case is given by @xcite @xmath37 alternatively , a continuous choice for the potential can be made @xcite by defining @xmath38 for all states @xmath30 below and above the fermi surface .",
    "this leads to a spectrum that is continuous at the fermi momentum . where @xmath39 = @xmath40-@xmath41 .",
    "the self - consistent single - particle potential can be written as follows @xmath42 fig . [ 4 ] displays the single - particle self - consistent potentials as a function of momentum at different densities using the cd - bonn potential .",
    "the single - particle potential at @xmath36=1.36 fm @xmath43 shows a significant deviation from a parabolic shape in particular at momenta slightly above the fermi momentum , see also @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that such a deviation tends to provide more attractive matrix elements of @xmath33 in evaluating the self - energy for hole states according to ( [ eq : selfbhf ] ) , which leads to more binding energy . at high fermi momentum ( @xmath44 @xmath29 and @xmath45 @xmath29 )",
    "this deviation is disappear .",
    "in the self - consistent green s function ( scgf ) formalisms , the self - energy is the key quantity to determine the one - body green s function .",
    "one can calculate the contribution of the hole - hole terms to the self - energy in a kind of perturbative way @xcite @xmath46    we assume a single - particle spectrum @xmath47 which is identical to the self - consistent bhf spectrum , but shifted by a constant @xmath48 , which ensures the self - consistency for @xmath49 @xmath50\\,.\\label{eq : ebhf1 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this shifted single - particle spectrum is also used in the bethe - goldstone equation .",

    "[ 6 ] illustrates the self - consistent solutions of the imaginary part of the self - energy , including only 2h1p .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath21 is different from zero only for energies @xmath10 below the fermi energy .",
    "this implies that @xmath52 for @xmath53 . from ( [ eq : disper2 ] ) one also observes , noting that the imaginary part of @xmath54 is positive , that for @xmath55 the on - shell value of the real part @xmath56 must be positive .",
    "it turns out that this holds for all single particle momenta below @xmath36 .",
    "the conservation of the total momentum in the two - nucleon of the g - matrix in ( [ eq:2h1p ] ) , @xmath57 , leads to a minimal value of @xmath10 at which this imaginary part is different from zero .",
    "due to these limitations the imaginary part integrated over all energies is much smaller for @xmath58 than for @xmath59 .",
    "the real part of @xmath21 is related to the imaginary part by a dispersion relation similar to the one of ( [ eq : disper2 ] ) , connecting the imaginary part of @xmath59 with the particle - particle ladder contributions to the real part of @xmath59 .",
    "since the imaginary part of @xmath21 is significantly smaller than the one of @xmath59 , the same is true also for the corresponding real part .",
    "the contribution of @xmath60 term is considerably smaller than the contribution of @xmath61 . at first sight",
    "this seems to confirm the notation that the effects of hh - propagation are considerably smaller than those corresponding to pp - propagation present in g - matrices .",
    "the lehmann representation of the green s function for infinite nuclear matter is given by @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the hole ( particle ) spectral function and we will discuss it in detail in the next section .",
    "the formal solution of dyson s equation is particularly simple in an infinite system , @xmath64    in this approximation the solution of the dyson equation leads only to a shift in the single particle energy according to ( [ eq : bhf1 ] ) . the green s function expression for the binding energy",

    "we have compared results for the binding energy of nuclear matter using the cd - bonn potential from different prescriptions ; ( i ) hartree - fock , ( ii ) bhf ( using continuous choice ) , and ( iii ) bhf+2h1p ( using conventional choice where the self - energy is calculated self consistently ) .",
    "the continuous choice leads to an enhancement of correlation effects in the medium and tends to predict larger binding energies for nuclear matter than the conventional choice .",
    "the conventional choice has been to ignore self - energy contribution for the particle states completely and approximate the energies by the kinetic energy only , see ( [ eq : conv ] ) . in nuclear matter one observes , that the inclusion of the 2h1p terms in the self - energy leads to less attractive quasiparticle energies , but more binding energy .",
    "the gain in binding energy due to the 2h1p components in the self - energy is about 0.5 mev per nucleon in nuclear matter at saturation density @xcite .",
    "we found that , no large difference in binding energy between both results , i.e. bhf and bhf+2h1p .",
    "the physical meaning of the spectral functions is rather simple .",
