    "in the recent past , researchers explored the potential role of patient reported outcome measures ( _ proms _ ) , consisting in ordinal - scaled questionnaires and self - reported measures , to follow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and to take timely healthcare decisions . such patient - friendly and low - cost measures allow to investigate on changes and individual impact of disease on many different domains of the patient s life including : physical , cognitive , psychological , social functioning and general well - being @xcite .",

    "ms patients experience a wide range of disorders , such as : fatigue , numbness , visual disturbances , bladder problems and mobility issues .",

    "this form is characterized by clearly defined _ relapses _ , i.e.attacks of neurological worsening , followed by partial or complete recovery . if left untreated , about @xmath1 of _ rr_patients develop _ sp_form within @xmath2 years and it takes only @xmath3 years on average for people to become unable to walk for @xmath4 meters unaided @xcite .",
