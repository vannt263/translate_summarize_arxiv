    "distribution of licensed digital content ( e.g. , software , movies , music etc . ) has become increasingly popular in recent times . with this",
    "comes the need to protect the copyright of the distributor against unauthorized redistribution of the content ( _ piracy _ ) .    to introduce the problem , we begin with an informal description .",
    "suppose the distributor has some content which he would like to distribute among a set of licensed users .",
    "one can think of a simple scheme where each licensed copy is identified by a unique mark ( _ fingerprint _ ) which is embedded in the content and is imperceptible to the users of the system .",
    "note that the distributed copies are identical except for the fingerprints .",
    "if a naive user distributes a copy of his fingerprinted content , then the pirated copy can easily be traced back to the guilty user and hence he will be exposed .",
    "tracing the guilty user becomes more difficult when a collection of users ( _ pirates _ ) form a _ coalition _ to detect the fingerprints and modify / erase them before illegally distributing the data .",
    "digital fingerprinting is a technique that assigns to each user a mark in a way that enables the distributor to identify at least one of the members of the coalition as long as its size does not exceed a certain threshold @xmath5 , which is a parameter of the problem .",
    "there are two main setups considered for the fingerprinting problem in the literature .",
    "the _ distortion _ setting is commonly used in applications relating to multimedia fingerprinting @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the fingerprint is usually a `` covert signal '' which is superimposed on the original `` host '' data in such a way that the difference , or distortion , between the original and the fingerprinted copies is smaller than some threshold .",
    "the coalitions are restricted to creating a forgery which has distortion less than some threshold from at least one of the colluders fingerprinted copies .",
    "on the other hand , we have the _ marking assumption _ setting introduced in @xcite which will be our main interest in this paper . in this case",
    ", the fingerprint is a set of redundant digits which are distributed in some random positions ( unknown to the users ) across the information digits of the original content .",
    "the fingerprint positions remain the same for all users .",
    "it is assumed that these redundant digits do not affect the functionality of the content , while tampering with an information digit damages the content permanently .",
    "the motivation for this assumption comes from applications to software fingerprinting , where modifying arbitrary digits can damage its functionality .",
    "the coalition attempts to discover some of the fingerprint positions by comparing their marked copies for differences .",
    "if they find a difference in some position , it is guaranteed to be a redundant fingerprint digit . in the other positions , it could be either an information digit or a fingerprint digit .",
    "the _ marking assumption _ states that the coalitions may modify only those positions where they find a difference in their fingerprinted copies .",
    "hence , in analyzing this model , it becomes sufficient to just look at the fingerprint positions and ignore the information digits .",
    "the collection of fingerprints distributed to all the users of the system together with the strategy of decoding ( pirate identification ) used is called a _ code _ below .",
    "a code is said to be _",
    "@xmath5-fingerprinting _ or _ collusion - secure _ against coalitions of @xmath5 pirates if the error probability of decoding approaches 0 as the code length tends to @xmath6    collusion - secure fingerprinting codes were introduced by boneh and shaw @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for any single deterministic code , the probability of decoding error in the `` wide - sense '' formulation ( see section [ sect : cap - def ] ) is bounded away from zero .",
    "hence , it becomes necessary for the distributor to use some form of randomization , where the random key is known only to the distributor , in order to construct such fingerprinting codes .",
    "this paper also gave the first example of codes with vanishing error probability .",
    "further general constructions were proposed by barg et al .",
    "@xcite and tardos @xcite .",
    "the case of zero error probability was considered independently by hollmann et al .",
    "@xcite who termed them as codes with the _ identifiable parent property _ , or ipp codes .",
    "they were further studied in @xcite among others .    in this paper , we are interested in computing the fundamental limits of the fingerprinting problem , i.e. , in establishing bounds on the capacity ( or maximum attainable rate ) of fingerprinting codes .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the capacity of fingerprinting with @xmath8-ary codes against coalitions of size @xmath5 ( this quantity is defined formally later in the paper ) .",
    "the problem of determining the fingerprinting capacity was raised in @xcite . to date",
    ", only some lower bounds are known through constructions and existence results : @xmath9 @xcite ; @xmath10 @xcite ; @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "new capacity bounds of our paper are based on an information - theoretic view of the fingerprinting problem .",
    "they are established as follows .",
    "attainability results ( lower bounds ) are shown by random coding techniques which take into account the typical coalitions , i.e. , the coalitions that occur with high probability .",
    "this represents a new idea in fingerprinting which enables us to improve random choice arguments of various kinds used earlier in @xcite . for upper bounds we model fingerprinting as a multi - user communications channel",
    "a converse theorem for a transmission scenario that models some aspects of the fingerprinting problem is proved to establish an upper bound on the capacity of fingerprinting .",
    "it should be noted that a similar information - theoretic approach to finding the capacity of fingerprinting was previously studied in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors obtain upper and lower bounds on the capacity of fingerprinting with distortion constraints as opposed to the marking assumption setting of this paper .",
    "paper @xcite uses the marking assumption setting , but it addresses a simpler problem whose results do not directly apply to fingerprinting .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : cap - def ] , we recall the statement of the fingerprinting problem and give an information - theoretic formulation .",
    "we also prove several results related to the problem statement that justify various techniques used to derive bounds on the fingerprinting capacity later in the paper .",
    "in particular , lower bounds on @xmath12 are proved in section [ sect : cap - lb2 ] .",

    "i.e. , a pair of encoding and decoding mappings : @xmath41 @xmath42 where the decoder output 0 will signify a decoding failure . by definition ,",
    "the fingerprinting system is formed by a _ randomized code _ ,",
    "i.e. , a random variable @xmath43 taking values in the family @xmath44 .",
    "note that the dependence on @xmath36 has been suppressed in this notation for simplicity .",
    "the _ rate _ of this code is @xmath45 .",
    "the system operates as follows .",
    "the distributor chooses a key @xmath46 according to a probability distribution @xmath47 on @xmath38 and assigns the fingerprint @xmath48 to user @xmath49 . on receiving a forged fingerprint",
    ", the distributor uses the tracing strategy @xmath50 ( corresponding to the selected key ) to determine one of the guilty users .",
    "we need randomization because : ( a ) deterministic fingerprinting codes do not exist in certain formulations @xcite , and ( b ) we allow the family of encoders and decoders and the distribution @xmath47 to be known to all users of the system .",
    "the only advantage the distributor has is the knowledge of the particular key being used .",
    "this assumption follows the accepted standards of cryptographic systems where it is usually assumed that the encryption / decryption algorithms are publicly available and that the only parameter kept secret by the system s constructor is the key .",
    "the fingerprints are assumed to be distributed inside the host message so that its location is unknown to the users .",
    "the location of the fingerprints , however , remains the same for all users .",
    "a _ coalition _",
    "@xmath51 of @xmath5 users is an arbitrary @xmath5-subset of @xmath52 following accepted usage , we will refer to the members of the coalition as `` pirates '' .",
    "the coalition observes the collection of their fingerprints @xmath53 and attempts to create a fingerprint @xmath54 that does not enable the distributor to trace it back to any of the users in @xmath51 .",
    "note that although the fingerprint locations are not available to the pirates , they may attempt to detect some of these locations by comparing their copies for differences . thus , coordinate @xmath49 of the fingerprints is called _ undetectable _ for the coalition @xmath51 if @xmath55 and is called _ detectable _ otherwise .",

    "is called the _",
    "envelope_. its definition depends on the exact rule the coalition should follow to modify the detectable positions :    * if the coalition is restricted to use only a symbol from their assigned fingerprints in the detectable positions , we obtain the _ narrow - sense envelope _ : @xmath60 * if the coalition can use any symbol from the alphabet in the detectable positions , we obtain the _ wide - sense envelope _ : @xmath61    we remark that there are further generalizations of the rules above where coalitions are also allowed to erase the symbols in detectable positions .",
    "this generalization is not considered below ; we refer the interested reader to @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we will use @xmath62 to denote the envelope from any of the rules or their generalizations mentioned above .",
    "[ rem : intro - bin ] the definition for a fingerprinting code depends on the envelope considered . therefore , different problems can arise for each definition of the envelope .",
    "the binary alphabet is of special interest because of its wide use in practical digital applications .",
    "for this special case , it is easy to see that the narrow - sense and wide - sense envelopes are exactly the same .",

    "a strategy @xmath66 is called admissible if @xmath67 let @xmath68 denote the class of admissible strategies .",
    "such randomized strategies model any general attack the coalition is capable of and also facilitate mathematical analysis .",
    "the distributor , on observing the suspect fingerprint @xmath56 , uses the decoder @xmath50 while using the key @xmath46 .",
    "then the probability of error for a given coalition @xmath51 and strategy @xmath66 averaged over the family of codes is defined as follows : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the expectation with respect to the distribution @xmath71    [ def : cap - fingcode ] a randomized code @xmath43 is said to be @xmath5-_fingerprinting with @xmath72-error _ if @xmath73      we now formulate the fingerprinting problem as a communications problem in which the set of messages is identified with the set of users of the fingerprinting system .",
    "each message is mapped to a codeword which corresponds to the fingerprint of the user .",

    "_ one _ of the transmitted messages to have produced the channel output .",
    "observe that this information - theoretic model differs from the traditional @xmath5-user multiple - access channel ( mac ) because : ( a ) the decoder makes an error only when its output does not match _ any of the transmitted messages _ , and ( b ) all channel inputs are required to use the same codebook .    for a given @xmath5-user strategy @xmath74 the _ maximum _ probability of error is given by @xmath75 note that here the users @xmath76 are not necessarily distinct .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the @xmath5-fingerprinting condition ( [ eqn : cap - fingdef ] ) can now be expressed as @xmath77    [ def : cap - capall ] for @xmath78 a number @xmath79 is an @xmath80-_achievable rate _ for @xmath8-ary @xmath5-fingerprinting if for every @xmath81 and every @xmath36 sufficiently large , there exists a randomized @xmath8-ary code @xmath43 of length @xmath36 with rate @xmath82 and maximum probability of error satisfying ( [ cap - eqn : maxpe ] ) .",

    "similarly to the above , let us consider the _ average _ error probability @xmath94 ( this quantity will be used in the derivation of upper bounds on the capacity @xmath7 ) and the probability @xmath95 for coalitions of size exactly @xmath5 . define the capacity @xmath96 with respect to the latter error probability .",
    "we make a remark on the relation between the average and maximum error criteria . in general",
    ", it is true that the average error criterion yields a higher capacity value compared to the maximum one .",
    "however , when randomization is allowed , it is well - known for single - user channels that the capacity value is the same for both the maximum and average error probability criteria ( cf . e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "we now extend this argument to the current context of multi - user channels and fingerprinting to show that both ( [ eqn : cap - maxpe2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : cap - avgpe2 ] ) lead to the same capacity value .",
    "[ prop : cap - rccap ] @xmath97    a formal proof is available in the appendix .",
    "it follows because here we simply use a randomized code @xmath43 , which also includes all @xmath98 permutations of any specific realization of @xmath43 . because of the symmetry introduced by this , the error probability @xmath99 is the same for all coalitions for a given @xmath66 , and hence the average and the maximum probability are the same .",
    "in this section , we construct fingerprinting codes for @xmath100 with error probability decaying exponentially in @xmath36 and with higher rate than previous constructions .",
    "the improvement is obtained by tailoring the decoder for the _ typical _ coalitions , i.e. , the coalitions that occur with high probability .",
