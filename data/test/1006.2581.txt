    "in the standard scenario of planet formation , planetesimals are the precursors of planets .",

    ", they grow to centimeter size in a protoplanetary disk via collisional agglomeration @xcite .",
    "the least understood growth phase is that of growth from centimeter size to kilometer size .",
    "since the gas drag of meter - sized aggregates is weak , they are slightly decoupled from gas with the sub - keplerian velocity . the resulting head - wind decreases their angular momentum and causes inward drift",
    ", whose timescale is about a few hundred years @xcite .",
    "the growth process in this stage must be faster than this drift timescale .",
    "another problem is the sticking probability of the aggregates . in this stage , since the threshold velocity for the destruction is low , their collisions may lead to destruction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a very thin and dense layer of settled dust aggregates in the mid - plane of the protoplanetary disk is gravitationally unstable .",
    "then the gravitational collapse of the dust layer occurs , and kilometer - sized planetesimals are formed directly @xcite .",
    "this scenario has the advantage of a very rapid formation timescale , which is on the order of the keplerian time , thus avoiding the migration of meter - sized aggregates .",
    "however , turbulence in the protoplanetary disk may prevent dust from settling to the mid - plane .",
    "as dust settles in the protoplanetary disk , a vertical shear velocity develops because the dust - rich gas in the mid - plane rotates with the velocity closer to the keplerian velocity than that of the dust - depleted gas , which may cause turbulence .",
    "the turbulence can mix dust with gas and prevent the dust layer from settling into a dense enough sheet for gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "problems concerning the gravitational instability of the dust layer still remain unsolved .",
    "there are two methods for calculating the dynamics of dust particles in gas : fluid simulation and @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "one can consider the particles as virtually fluid and treat them with the euler equation or navier - stokes equation .",
    "for example , @xcite performed the two - dimensional numerical simulation to investigate the density evolution of the dust layer due to gravitational instability .",
    "they assumed that the dust layer is axisymmetric with respect to the rotational axis .",
    "they treated the dust component as a pressure - free fluid because the velocity dispersion of dust is negligible if the stopping time @xmath2 is sufficiently short , where the stopping time @xmath2 is the characteristic timescale for a particle to stop in gas .",
    "they found that the dust layer becomes extremely thin if the stopping time is long .",
    "@xcite performed the numerical simulation of the gravitational instability of a two - dimensional thin disk and investigated the non - axisymmetric modes .    on the other hand , we can investigate the dynamics of particles in gas by using @xmath0-body simulations @xcite .",
    "this is straightforward and precise , but the calculation is very time - consuming and the practical number of particles is limited .",
    "@xcite performed @xmath0-body simulations of a gravitationally unstable disk with a local - shearing box .",
    "they investigated the formation of clumps of planetesimals at t30 au by the gravitational instability .",
    "they considered the drag force from the background gas .",
    "they showed that the planetesimal clumps form owing to the gravitational instability , which correspond to planetesimals in our calculation . in their simulation ,",
    "the optical depth is smaller than that in our calculation and the particle disk is unstable even initially .",
    "we consider the formation of planetesimals at 1 au , thus we use the large optical depth , and assume the dust layer is initially stable .",
    "@xcite performed a set of local simulations of the self - gravitating collisional particle disks without gas using @xmath0-body simulation ( hereafter paper i ) .",
    "dust particle dynamics is calculated with the hill equations in a local - shearing box @xcite .",
    "they adopted the rubble pile model ( hard and soft sphere models ) as collision models .",
    "they found that the formation process is divided into three stages : the formation of non - axisymmetric wake - like structures @xcite , the creation of aggregates , and the rapid collisional growth of the aggregates .",
    "the mass of the largest aggregates is larger than the mass predicted by the linear perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite adopted the alternative model of collisions , ` accretion model ' ( paper ii ) . in the accretion model ,",
    "the number of particles decreases as the calculation proceeds ; thereby this model enables us to perform large - scale and long - term simulations .",
    "they obtained the final mass of planetesimals as a function of the size of the computational box .",
    "@xcite performed the numerical simulations to investigate the validity of the super - particle approximation .",
    "they considered the various physics , such as the gas drag , the self - gravity , the physical collision and the turbulence .",
    "they treated the collisions as the hard sphere model .",
    "they investigated the numerical requirements to study the gravitational instability .",
    "to understand the basic dynamics of gravitational instability , we neglected the effect of gas in papers i and ii .",
    "however , it is obvious that the gas plays an important role in planetesimal formation when dust particles are small .",
    "the interaction with gas through drag is dominant in the dynamical evolution of particles .",
    "many authors investigated the effect of gas .",
    "the particles drift radially due to gas drag @xcite . as the sedimentation of dust aggregates towards the midplane proceeds , the vertical velocity shear increases .",
    "thus , the kelvin - helmholtz instability occurs @xcite .",
    "the kelvin - helmholtz instability makes the dust layer turbulent .",
    "the turbulent gas prevents the concentration of dust @xcite , and helps the concentration @xcite .",

    "the loss of angular momentum due to the gas drag helps gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "the time - scale for the dissipative instability is relatively slow , but the dust layer may be unstable even when the toomre s q value is larger than unity . as a first step toward understanding the effect of gas on gravitational instability , we introduce gas as a background laminar flow in the present paper .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the effect of the laminar gas on the planetesimal formation through gravitational instability .",
    "the laminar flow causes the dissipation of the kinetic energy and thus radial migration of dust .    in",

    "we summarize the results in  6 .",
    "the linear stability analyses of the dust layer with a finite thickness were performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they assumed that the size of dust aggregates is sufficiently small , in other words , dust is fully coupled with gas , thus they treated gas and dust as one fluid . that introduces no dissipation due to gas drag .",
    "they considered the vertical structure of the dust layer , and studied the roche criterion .",
    "the linear stability analyses of dissipative gravitational instability were performed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we summarize the essence of their results . @xcite and @xcite used one component model , i.e. , they neglected the dynamics of gas flow , but they consider the gas drag from the stationary background gas flow . using their results",
    ", we discuss conditions for the gravitational instability under the influence of gas drag .",
    "we adopt the isothermal equation of state for the dust layer : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pressure , @xmath5 is the isothermal sound speed , and @xmath6 is the density of the dust layer . in this equation of state ,",
    "the velocity dispersion of dust is always constant .",
    "clearly , the velocity dispersion must not be constant .",
    "it changes owing to several processes such as gas drag , inelastic collisions , and gravitational scattering .",
    "this assumption gives us the simple analytical expression of the dispersion relation , with which we can grasp the nature of dissipative gravitational instability .",
    "we assume that the gas velocity is equal to the kepler velocity .",
    "we consider the reference point that is at the semi - major axis @xmath7",
    ". the kepler angular velocity of the reference point is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the central star and @xmath10 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we introduce the local cartesian coordinates in which the @xmath11-axis is directed radially , the @xmath12-axis follows the direction of rotation , and the @xmath13-axis follows the direction perpendicular to mid - plane .",
    "we define @xmath14 as the deviation velocity field from the local kepler velocity .",
    "the basic equations for the dust layer in this frame are given by @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gravitational potential due to the self - gravity .",
    "the simulation results in  4 show that the density fluctuation is not axisymmetric .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , restricting ourselves to the axisymmetric mode ( @xmath19 ) , we carry out a normal mode analysis in the form of @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the wave number in the @xmath11-direction and @xmath22 is the growth rate .    integrating toward @xmath13 , we obtain the equation of perturbed quantities @xmath23 : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the surface density of the dust layer . @xcite",
    "considered the finite thickness model using the softening term @xcite .",
    "poisson equation with the softening parameter is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the scale height of the dust layer and @xmath31 is the softening parameter : @xmath32    for nontrivial solutions , the determinant of the coefficient matrix must vanish .",
    "thus the following dispersion relation is obtained @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the mode for @xmath35 is unstable , where @xmath36 is the real part of a complex number @xmath37 . in the gas - free limit ( @xmath38 ) and the thin disk limit ( @xmath39 )",
    ", the dispersion relation converges to the conventional dispersion relation of a thin disk @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : disp1 ] ) can be written in a non - dimensional form scaled by the length @xmath40 and the time @xmath41 : @xmath42 where we used toomre s @xmath1 given by @xmath43 .",
    "a tilde denotes non - dimensional quantity hereafter .",
    "a dissipative dust layer is secularly unstable for long - wavelength modes although @xmath44 .",
    "the physical mechanism of the instability is explained as follows @xcite .",
    "we consider a thin axisymmetric overdense ring and the thick back - ground gas . from the force balance of the self - gravity , we find that the dust rotates faster at the outer edge of the ring .",
    "thus , the drag force at the outer edge is strong .",
    "this causes the inward drift .",
    "conversely , the dust at the inner edge drifts outward .",
    "these effects shrink ring radially .",
    "figure [ fig : disper.eps ] shows the dispersion relation of the dust layer under gas drag for @xmath45 .",
    "we used the thin disk model ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the stopping time is @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ( gas - free ) .",
    "all models have the maximum growth rate at @xmath51 .",
    "we will see that the growth rate has the maximum value at @xmath52 in  [ sec : mugr ] . as the stopping time lengthens ,",
    "the growth rate shrinks . in the gas - free model ,",
    "long - wavelength modes are stable , while in the gas model , they are unstable .      as discussed in  [ sec : dispersion ] , the dust layer is always unstable for long - wavelength modes . however , the timescale of the instability can be longer than the dynamical timescale , because this is the secular instability .",
    "therefore , in order to understand what happens , we have to compare the timescale of the instability with those of other processes such as the sedimentation , the radial migration , and the growth of dust aggregates .    here , we assume the thin disk approximation ( @xmath46 ) in order to obtain the simple analytical formula . for @xmath53",
    ", @xmath54 is a real positive value .",
    "the growth rate for the most unstable mode @xmath54 is a function of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath1 . from equation ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) ,",
    "the partial derivative of @xmath54 with respect to @xmath55 is given as @xmath57 using equation ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) , we can show that the denominator on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : disp3 ] ) is positive when @xmath58 .",
    "hence , the @xmath54 has the maximum value at @xmath59 for a fixed @xmath56 and @xmath1 .",
    "the substitution of @xmath59 into equation ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) provides the equation of the maximum growth rate @xmath60 : @xmath61    to obtain the condition that the gravitational instability dominates over the other process ( symbolically denoted by `` x '' ) , we equate @xmath62 with @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the characteristic timescale of a process x , ans solve the resultant equation with respect to q to obtain @xmath1 value : @xmath65 when @xmath66 , gravitational instability is a dominant process compared to the process x. on the other hand , when @xmath67 , the timescale for the process x is shorter than the timescale of gravitational instability .",
    "although the dust layer is unstable , the process x is dominant .",
    "we can derive the leading term of the power series expansion with respect to @xmath2 for equation ( 13 ) and find the asymptotic solution @xcite . when the gas drag is strong @xmath68 ,",
    "the growth rate for the most unstable mode is @xmath69 conversely , when the gas drag force is weak @xmath70 and @xmath44 , the growth rate for the most unstable mode is @xmath71 when @xmath72 , the growth rate for the most unstable mode converges to the finite value @xmath73 as @xmath74 , which is the maximum growth rate for the gas - free gravitational instability .",

    "the system is characterized by two non - dimensional parameters , the optical depth and the ratio of the hill radius to the diameter of a particle @xcite : @xmath100 @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the internal density and initial radius of the particle , respectively .",
    "the realistic value for `` solid '' dust particles is @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",

    "we set the optical depth @xmath108 , which is approximately equal to the realistic value @xmath109 for @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath105 .",
    "since our choice of @xmath112 is smaller than the realistic value , a particle used in the simulation is not a realistic dust particle but a ` super - particle ' that represents a group of many small particles that have the same position and velocity .",
    "thus the restitution coefficient @xmath113 corresponds to the rate of the dissipation due to collisions between super - particles .",
    "the low value of @xmath112 means that the physical size of a particle in our simulation is very large .",
    "this implies that the effect of the gravitational scattering is relatively weaker than that of collisions .",
    "we investigated the @xmath112 value dependence in paper i and ii in the narrow range ( @xmath114 ) and we confirmed that the formation process does not change in this range qualitatively .",

    "the relative tangential velocity is conserved and the magnitude of the relative normal velocity is reduced by a factor of @xmath113 .",

    "we also use the accretion model ( e.g. , paper ii , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model , when two particles collide ,",

    "the binding condition is described by the jacobi integral @xmath118 ( e.g. , paper ii , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the hard - sphere model ,",

    "the hard - sphere model is more realistic than the accretion model .",
