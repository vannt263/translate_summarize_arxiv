    "in quantum mechanics non - hermitian hamiltonians with imaginary potentials have become an important tool to describe systems with loss or gain effects @xcite .",

    "when the strength of the gain and loss contributions is increased typically pairs of these real eigenvalues pass through an exceptional point , i.e.  a branch point at which both the eigenvalues and the wave functions are identical , and become complex and complex conjugate",
    ".    a promising candidate for the realisation of a @xmath0 symmetric quantum system are bose - einstein condensates . at sufficiently low temperatures and densities they can in the mean - field limit",
    "be described by the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "if a condensate is trapped in a double - well potential it is possible to add atoms to one side of the double well and remove atoms from the other .",
    "this leads to a gain or loss to the condensate s probability amplitude .",
    "if the strength of both contributions is equal , the process can effectively be described by a complex external potential @xmath8 rendering the hamiltonian @xmath0 symmetric @xcite .",
    "the experimental realisation of an open quantum system with @xmath0 symmetry will be an important step since the experimental verification has only been achieved in optics so far @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity @xmath9 of the gross - pitaevskii equation introduces new interesting properties such as @xmath0 broken states which appear for gain / loss contributions lower than those at which the corresponding @xmath0 symmetric states vanish . in optics",
    "the same effect can be observed for wave guides with a kerr nonlinearity .",
    "they are described by an equation being mathematically equivalent to the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "it has been shown that the additional features appearing in the presence of the nonlinearity might be exploited to create uni - directional structures @xcite or solitons . since @xmath0 symmetry in optics",
    "is extensively studied and has been experimentally realised @xcite these approaches seem to be very promising .    from the mathematical point of view",
    "a new type of bifurcation appearing in the nonlinear @xmath0 symmetric gross - pitaevskii equation is of special interest . as in linear quantum systems",
    "two @xmath0 symmetric stationary states merge in an exceptional point if the strength of a parameter describing the gain and loss processes is increased .",
    "however , in contrast to its linear counterpart the gross - pitaevskii equation possesses no @xmath0 broken states emerging at this exceptional point .",
    "they already appear for lower strengths of the gain / loss parameter and bifurcate from one of the @xmath0 symmetric states in a pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "the new bifurcation point has been identified to be a third - order exceptional point @xcite .",
    "for attractive nonlinearities one finds that the @xmath0 broken solutions bifurcate from the ground state . in this scenario",
    "the @xmath0 symmetric ground state is the only state which exists on both sides of the bifurcation and always possesses a real energy eigenvalue .",
    "the pitchfork bifurcation is expected to entail a change of its stability .",
    "however , it is observed that this stability change does not occur exactly at the bifurcation but at a slightly different value of the gain / loss parameter .",
    "the discrepancy between the points of bifurcation and stability change seems to be surprising and does not appear in all similar systems .",
    "the mean - field limit of a two mode approximation with a bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite does not show this effect .",

    "the latter system contains a harmonic trap in which infinitely many stationary states can be found , whereas the nonlinear two - mode system exhibits only four states , viz .",
    "the two @xmath0 symmetric and the two @xmath0 broken states mentioned above .",
    "furthermore the nonlinearity derived in @xcite is slightly different from that of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "it has the form @xmath10 , and hence does not depend on the norm of the wave function .",
    "thus , there might be two reasons for the appearance of the discrepancy .",
    "it could have its origin in the existence of higher modes influencing the ground state s stability or in the norm - dependency of the gross - pitaevskii nonlinearity .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to clarify this question .",
    "to do so we study a bose - einstein condensate in an idealised double-@xmath1 trap @xcite , a system of which already its linear counterpart helped to understand basic properties of @xmath0 symmetric structures",
    ". this system is described by the gross - pitaevskii equation , i.e. the contact interaction has the norm - dependent form @xmath9 .",
    "however , it exhibits only four stationary states of which two are @xmath0 symmetric and two are @xmath0 broken as in the two - mode model @xcite .",
    "additionally , in a numerical study the structure of the nonlinearity can easily be changed such that the system s mathematical properties can be brought in agreement with the mean - field limit of the bose - hubbard dimer .",
    "the article is organised as follows",
    ". we will introduce and solve the gross - pitaevskii equation of a bose - einstein condensate in a double-@xmath1 trap for an attractive atom - atom interaction in section [ sec : bec_delta ] .",

    "we investigated the origin of the discrepancy between the value of the gain / loss parameters , at which the ground state of a bose - einstein condensate in a double - well trap passes through a pitchfork bifurcation and at which its stability changes . in a naive expectation",
    "these @xmath31 values should be identical .",
    "however , it is found that this is not exactly fulfilled . since this discrepancy does not occur for a similar system , viz .  the mean - field limit of a bose - hubbard dimer @xcite , we investigated the differences between the equations describing both systems .",
    "it was found that the norm - dependency of the nonlinearity in the hamiltonian @xmath77 is unambiguously the origin of the discrepancy .",
    "it can be completely removed with the replacement @xmath83 .",
    "an intuitive explanation can be given .",

    "as has been shown in this article the stability relations are nontrivial close to branch points in condensate setups with gain and loss .",
