    "recent years have seen a crescendo of observational and theoretical interest in the population of nearby m dwarfs . these stars , which make up the majority of the stars in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have historically been difficult to observe due to their optical faintness . during the past two decades",
    ", great strides have been made in the refinement of techniques for identifying nearby m dwarfs .",
    "multiple groups have used parallaxes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , photometry , and proper motions to identify thousands of m dwarfs in the solar neighborhood @xcite and throughout the galaxy @xcite .    in parallel , tools for observationally characterizing these stars",
    "have improved dramatically @xcite .",
    "even so , the precise measurement of their stellar parameters remains challenging .",
    "precise stellar radii and masses have only been measured for a small set of targets through interferometry and the study of eclipsing binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the measurement of m dwarf stellar compositions has also presented a formidable challenge , as the molecular species in their atmospheres mask the continuum , typically rendering the direct spectroscopic modeling techniques intractable ( although progress is being made , e.g.  @xcite ) . instead of direct modeling , the detailed analysis of atomic line and molecular absorption in m dwarf spectra has also been demonstrated @xcite .    rather than depending solely on the m dwarf spectra to derive abundance information ,",
    "several groups have instead relied on abundance measurements of associated stars .",
    "these calibrator systems typically contain an fgk dwarf in a common - proper - motion system with an m dwarf , separated by several arcseconds or more .",
    "the composition of the higher - mass star is known or readily determined using established spectroscopic techniques ( as deployed for m subdwarfs in * ? ? ?",
    "the m dwarf is then assumed to have the same composition , and their photometric and spectroscopic properties are used to construct empirical models that can then be applied to single stars .",
    "this empirical calibration strategy was first implemented for optical photometry , taking advantage of the strong and weak [ fe / h ] dependence for m dwarf @xmath4 and @xmath5-band absorption , respectively .",
    "multiple groups have developed similar photometric calibrations based on absolute stellar magnitudes and colors @xcite , and @xcite have further leveraged these photometric [ fe / h ] calibrations into more precise optical spectroscopic calibrations .",
    "this empirical calibration technique has also been implemented for near - infrared ( nir ) spectra , taking advantage of the relative brightness of m dwarfs in the nir .",
    "the first of these was the @xmath5-band calibration developed by @xcite , which leveraged the @xmath5-band doublet and triplet , along with h@xmath6o absorption indices to account for t@xmath3 effects .",
    "this technique was expanded by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , t12 ) , refined in @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter n14 ) , and further generalized in @xcite ( hereafter m13a ) .",
    "presently , the nir calibration with the largest number and diversity of calibrators is that of m13a for early - mid m dwarfs , and @xcite ( hereafter m14 ) for late - type m dwarfs ; these calibrations provide [ fe / h ] and [ m / h ] , are well - calibrated across a wide range of [ fe / h ] ( @xmath7 [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ) and spectral type ( late k to m8 ) , and have good precision ( @xmath9 dex in [ fe / h ] and [ m / h ] ) .",
    "in addition to the empirical techniques for measuring stellar composition , various groups have developed similar techniques for the measurement of spectral type , effective temperature , stellar mass , and stellar radius , based on spectral type standards , stars with interferometrically - determined parameters , or stars with parameters measured through other means .",
    "notably , techniques applicable to high resolution optical spectra from harps @xcite and keck @xcite have achieved good precision for the m dwarfs observed in these programs .",
    "techniques based on lower - resolution ( @xmath2 ) nir spectra , using t@xmath3-sensitive indices @xcite ( hereafter m13b ) and atomic absorption features @xcite have been also been developed . the use of broadband photometry has also enabled precise measurements of the temperatures and radii of these stars @xcite .",
    "the resulting suite of techniques has been used extensively in the characterization of _ kepler _ low - mass planet hosts @xcite .",
    "the tools and data described above , combined with advances in structural @xcite and atmospheric models , provide a fertile ground for a variety of topics related to m dwarfs , including galactic evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , stellar structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and exoplanets .",
    "nearby m dwarfs are appealing targets for doppler radial velocity ( rv ) and transit exoplanet searches because their low masses and luminosities make planets orbiting in their habitable zones ( hz * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) more easily detectable than those around higher - mass stars .",
    "moreover , given the prevalence of m dwarfs , their planets may represent the most common exoplanetary environment in the galaxy . upcoming nir ground - based rv surveys such as the habitable - zone planet finder on the hobby - eberly telescope ( hpf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , carmenes @xcite at calar alto , spirou on the cfht @xcite , ird on subaru @xcite , and ilocater on lbt as well as photometric surveys like tess @xcite , plato @xcite , and mearth @xcite will specifically target planets around nearby m dwarfs .",
    "these surveys will provide unprecedented sensitivity to planets orbiting the nearby m dwarfs , whose optical faintness has made them difficult targets for many existing rv and transit surveys . despite being optimized for optically bright fgk stars , results from _ kepler _",

    "the characteristics of planets around m dwarfs will be useful for testing theories of planet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) in the regime of low stellar and protoplanetary disk masses .    in order to construct a well - characterized target list for hpf ,",
    "we have carried out an extensive spectroscopic survey of 886 nearby m dwarfs , using the spex spectrograph at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "we take advantage of the nir spectroscopic techniques described above to measure the metallicities of these stars , in order to form the largest catalog yet of nearby m dwarf compositions based on spectroscopy .",
    "we also provide measurements of the t@xmath3-sensitive indices , which can be used to estimate stellar mass , radius , or luminosity .",

    "t12 developed a new @xmath10-band [ fe / h ] calibration for m dwarfs , extending established techniques and providing a valuable comparison for the development of improved calibrations ( m13a ) and a starting point for work with higher resolution spectra ( e.g. sdss - iii apogee or igrins , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite again applied the t12 [ fe / h ] measurement technique to confirm the first low - mass members of the nearby coma berenices cluster @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite leveraged m dwarf activity catalogs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and improvements in parallax measurements of the nearby m dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and the research consortium on nearby stars , recons ) to develop new spectroscopic indices for m dwarf luminosity , surface gravity , and possibly @xmath11-enrichment .",
    "over a period of two years , beginning in 2011 may and concluding in 2013 august , we observed 886 m dwarfs with the spex nir spectrograph on the nasa - irtf @xcite .",
    "this set of observations includes 21 stars observed multiple times .",
    "we drew m dwarf targets primarily from the ( * ? ? ? *",
    "lspm - n ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lg11 ) proper - motion based catalogs of nearby m dwarfs , and from published lists of m dwarf planet hosts and known wide binaries ( drawn from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that serve as abundance calibration stars .",
    "the majority of target stars ( 829 ) were taken from lg11 , the remainder being the aforementioned binary calibrator stars , planet hosts , or that were targeted in a contemporaneous high - resolution survey @xcite . for stars from lg11 and lspm - n , we prioritized targets with redder optical - to - infrared color ( @xmath12 ) , a good indication of mid - late m spectral subtype ( m4 or later ) .",
    "the resulting compilation of targets included both high - priority targets ( calibrator stars , planet hosts , late - type m dwarfs ) and low - priority targets ( early type m dwarfs ) .    from this super - set of potential targets we constructed our nightly observing plans , and during each night we actively added and removed targets to account for changes in observing conditions . our primary goal was to ensure very high signal - to - noise ( snr @xmath13 per pixel ) for high - priority targets , and our secondary goal was to observe as many m dwarfs as possible with reasonable snr ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the typical resulting observing pattern was a series of groups ( in position and time ) which contained a few faint late - type ( m4 or later ) m dwarfs and several brighter early ( earlier than m4 ) m dwarfs . each group was sufficiently localized that a single nearby standard star ( within one hour of time and 0.1 @xmath15 of target star ) could be used for telluric correction , and the same arc lamp exposure could be used for wavelength calibration .",
    "this strategy enabled a large number of m dwarfs to be observed , with minimal time losses from large slews , wavelength calibrations , and standard star observations .",
    "we obtained uniform data for all observations , operating spex in the short cross - dispersed ( sxd ) mode with the @xmath16 slit , which produces @xmath17 spectra from 0.8 - 2.4 @xmath18 .",
    "as described in t12 , we extracted these spectra with the facility - provided spextool package @xcite .",
    "we telluric - corrected using the ` xtellcor ` program @xcite and observations of an a0v star ( or similar ) , at an airmass and observation time within 0.1 ( @xmath15 ) and 1 hour of the target , respectively .",
    "the ` xtellcor ` program also flux - calibrates the spectrum , using the optical magnitudes ( from simbad ) of the standard star to estimate its flux as a function of wavelength .",
    "@xcite estimate that the flux calibration using this method agrees to within a few percent of fluxes derived using broadband magnitudes .",
    "a typical example spectrum is shown in figure [ specex ] .",
    "all observations presented here took place prior to the spex detector upgrade , which occurred in the spring of 2014 .",
    "we cross - identified our targets with several published catalogs , in order to provide supplementary data for our target stars and to facilitate the use of our catalog , each target has a 2mass @xcite identifier , and we use the 2mass j2000 coordinates in our final catalog .",

    "we also found parallaxes in several other catalogs @xcite .",
    "we describe here the various spectral measurements we performed on the m dwarf spectra .",

    "the precise relationship between this nir m sub - type and the established palomar / michigan state university ( pmsu ) scale @xcite is considered in @xcite and n14 , and is known to be sensitive to [ fe / h ] for at least the early m dwarfs .",
    "we also include in our catalog the measured pmsu spectral types from the n14 pmsu spectral type calibration over the range in which it is valid ( m1-m4 ) .    to check the consistency of our nir spectral type measurements , we considered the overlap between our sample and that of n14 , which includes 152 m dwarfs .",
    "we found no significant offset between the respective measures of spectral type , and a scatter of half a subtype , consistent with the scatter expected from n14 .",
    "this nir spectral type measurement was necessarily the first in our chain of measurements , as it defined the template for our measurement of rv .",
    "the t@xmath3-sensitive features are sufficiently broad that they are insensitive to rv shifts in our @xmath2 spectra .",
    "nonetheless , after measuring the rv we re - measured the spectral type in the rest frame of the star , and this is the value we report in our catalog .",
    "we measured the rv of each order of each spectrum by fitting a gaussian to the cross - correlation ( in log-@xmath42 ) of the observed spectrum with a spectral template of similar spectral type .",
    "we used three spectral templates from the irtf cool stars library @xcite : for stars m4 and earlier we used the m1.5v star hd 36395 , for stars m5 to m6 we used the m5v star gl 51 , and for stars later than m6 we used the m9v star lhs 2065 .",

    "given the consistency of the rv measurements of the majority of the common targets , we suspect that these highly discrepant targets are either rv - variable or binary stars .",

    "the origin of the @xmath49  km  s@xmath44 offset for our data is unclear ; since we rely solely on the arc lamp wavelength calibrations , we are subject to different and possibly worse instrumental systematics than n14 , who use telluric spectra to refine their wavelength calibrations . a systematic issue with the wavelength calibration of approximately 8  km  s@xmath44 is also supported by the magnitudes of the inter - order and rv template differences , as discussed in section [ uncertainties ] .",

    "[ rv_validation ] ]      due to the difficulty of modeling m dwarf atmospheres and spectra , model - dependent measurements of t@xmath3 can systematically differ by 100 k or more ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "interferometric t@xmath3 measurements have therefore been crucial in defining the m dwarf t@xmath3 scale , and in parsing the relations between the fundamental parameters of m dwarfs ( * ? ? ? * and references therein )",
    ". however , there are few targets with spectral type m5 or later that are bright enough or have large enough angular diameters to support precise interferometric radius measurements .",
    "to enable stellar radius measurements without interferometry , multiple groups have constructed empirical calibrations based on photometry @xcite , spectral indices ( m13b ) , or individual absorption feature strengths @xcite .",

    "these relations use a similar calibration set to that of m13b , so the range of validity is similar : @xmath54  k.      we measured [ fe / h ] and [ m / h ] using the empirical spectroscopic calibrations from t12 , m13a , m14 , and n14 .",
