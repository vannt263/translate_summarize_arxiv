    "the present knowledge of solar and stellar magnetism derives essentially from the interpretation of polarization in spectral lines due to the zeeman effect . in the presence of a weak magnetic field ,",
    "the radiative transfer equation for polarized light can be solved analytically and it is known as the `` weak field approximation '' .",
    "although very simple , it relies on a set of strong assumptions that we discuss later .",
    "however , the weak field approximation is applicable in many scenarios and gives very good results for the inference of magnetic fields as compared with more elaborate methods . in solar physics , it is at the heart of the success of a large number of synoptic magnetographs , like those of big bear @xcite .",
    "it has been also used recently to produce vector magnetograms with the imaging magnetograph experiment ( imax ) instrument @xcite onboard the sunrise balloon @xcite . in stellar spectropolarimetry ,",

    "recently , @xcite derived the weak field expressions in terms of fluxes , particularizing to the case of the stellar dipole .",
    "they neglected rotation to simplify the equations and to derive analytical expressions for the inference of the magnetic field .",
    "when rotation is taken into account ( in other words , there is a correlation between the magnetic field and the line - of - sight velocity ) , the problem becomes much more challenging and it is usually solved numerically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent effort ) . however , we show in this paper that it is possible to obtain analytical expressions for the stokes vector fluxes in the weak field approximation .",
    "there are two interests on this effort .",
    "first , having an analytical expression for the stokes flux might be of help to investigate the interplay between rotation and the magnetic field .",
    "second , it can be used to speed up inversion codes based on the weak - field approximation because no numerical integration is needed .",
    "this will facilitate the application of bayesian inference codes , like the one developed by @xcite , that are based on markov chain monte carlo methods that need to carry out the synthesis thousands of times to sample the posterior distribution .",
    "this is the first paper of a series dealing with analytical expressions for the fluxes of the stokes parameters in the weak field limit",
    ". this paper deals with the expressions for a rotating star with a magnetic field on its surface .",
    "the results depend on the correlation between the magnetic field and the velocity and are general for any rotation profile or any magnetic field configuration .",
    "we particularize the equations to the case of a rotating magnetic stellar dipole .",

    "the vector @xmath0 defines any position on the stellar surface.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    our aim is to compute the local stokes profiles emerging from every point of the visible surface and compute its integral . as explained in the introduction , a simple ( although subject to approximations ) way to relate the emergent stokes profiles with the magnetic field vector",
    "is the weak - field approximation .",
    "this approximation ( combined with the weak - line approximation for linear polarization ) leads to an analytical solution to the radiative transfer equation .",
    "it is based on the following three fundamental assumptions : i ) the magnetic field vector is constant along the line of sight on the region of the stellar atmosphere where the spectral line is formed , ii ) the magnetic field intensity is sufficiently weak so that the zeeman splitting is smaller than any other line broadening mechanism and iii ) the los velocity and any broadening mechanism are constant with height in the line formation region . under these simplifying conditions ,",
    "the magnetic field can be considered as a perturbation to the zero - field case .",
    "this approximation is not strictly valid in general , but it is a good approximation whenever the magnetic field strength is weak in the line formation region in the absence of strong gradients along the los .",
    "quantitatively , the approximation holds whenever @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( see eq .",
    "( 3.14 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the zeeman splitting that is proportional to the field strength , @xmath7 is the dominant broadening mechanism and @xmath8 represents the effective land factor of the line , which quantifies the magnetic sensitivity of the line and that only depends on the quantum numbers of the transition ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . from its definition , it is clear that the weak field regime occurs at different field strengths for different spectral lines , for different stellar objects and for different spectral resolutions . for instance , for a magnetically sensitive iron spectral line with @xmath9 at 5000   with a standard thermal broadening at @xmath10 k , the weak - field regime is applicable for fields below @xmath11600 g if the spectral resolution of the spectrograph is smaller than the line broadening . under the previous simplifying assumptions , and to first order in @xmath6 , the intensity profile @xmath12 of a spectral line formed in a weak magnetic field is fully insensitive to the magnetic field . in other words , it fulfills the standard radiative transfer equation in the absence of a magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". likewise , at first order in @xmath6 , the circular polarization profile , i.e. , the stokes @xmath13 profile for a given spectral line , has the following expression : @xmath14 where the symbol @xmath15 stands for the longitudinal component of the magnetic field ( the projection along the los in the reference system shown in fig .",

    "the symbol @xmath16 stands for the wavelength while @xmath17 is the central wavelength of the transition . the constant @xmath18 .    at first order in @xmath6 ,",
    "linear polarization is zero . in order to obtain an expression for",
    "the stokes profiles characterizing linear polarization we have to expand the radiative transfer equation to second order in @xmath6 and assume that the spectral line is not saturated and weak .",
    "under these assumptions , a good approximation to the intensity profile emerging from the stellar atmosphere is to consider it , in general , proportional to a voigt function ( see eqs .",
    "( 9.84 ) and ( 9.86 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we consider the case of a gaussian line profile .",
    "all our results can be derived for a voigt profile but the final expressions are more complicated without any fundamental difference .",
    "this assumption somehow reduces the scope of applicability of our results for linear polarization because the line shape self - similarity is only valid for lines whose line depth is smaller than @xmath1140% according to the results of @xcite .    with this assumption , the weak - field approximation for the stokes @xmath19 and @xmath20 , defined in the @xmath21 reference system shown in fig .",

    "again , it is only a function of the quantum numbers of the transition @xcite .",
    "the symbols @xmath24 and @xmath25 stand for the components of the magnetic field vector along the @xmath2 and @xmath26 axes , respectively .",
    "the stokes profiles in any other reference system that is defined as a rotation around the @xmath1 axis by an angle @xmath27 are given by the usual rotation @xcite : @xmath28 where the quantities with the subindex `` new '' refer in this case to the new reference frame .",
    "when observing unresolved objects , the detected polarized radiation is obtained as an integration in the plane of the sky of the individual stokes parameters at each point of the stellar surface ( @xmath29 ) , all of them referred to a common reference system .",
    "we describe the stellar disk using the polar coordinates @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath30 is normalized to the stellar radius , so that its range is from 0 to 1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the average of any arbitrary function @xmath32 on the surface @xmath29 will be given by : @xmath33 as a consequence , it is obvious that the observed values of the stokes flux vector depends on the surface distribution of the magnetic field , on the centre - to - limb variation ( clv ) of the radiation , and on the doppler effect due to the rotation of the star .",
    "following standard approximations and assuming that the star has azimuthal symmetry , @xcite parameterized the intensity at each point of the star as a product of two functions :",
    "@xmath34 , that only depends on the wavelength ( the intensity at the disc centre since they neglect rotation ) , and @xmath35 , the clv that depends on the position on the disk and is wavelength independent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath36 the clv is given in terms of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the astrocentric angle between the normal to a point in the stellar surface and the line of sight ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig_geom ] ) . the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 have values between 0 and 1 and",
    "are supposed to be constant along the spectral line ( although they can vary from line to line ) . with this assumption",
    ", we also force the line depth to be @xmath41-independent .",
    "note that the values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 have to fulfill the condition that the intensity has to be positive .",
    "this simple parameterization allowed them to express the weak field equations in terms of the observed fluxes , thus mimicking the expressions for the specific stokes vector .",
    "this was possible because the intensity flux is assumed to be the product of the wavelength - dependent intensity at disk center and the wavelength independent clv . using this relationship ,",
    "the weak - field and weak - line approximation for the integrated polarized flux remains formally the same than for the specific stokes vector but the components of the magnetic field appear weighted by the clv law .",
    "when the velocity field is included , the situation turns out to be much more complicated because the intensity itself depends on the local projection of the velocity along the @xmath1 axis ( @xmath42 ) , which subsequently depends on the position along the stellar disk in a potentially complicated way . in this case , the fluxes of the stokes vector are expressed as : @xmath43\\frac{\\partial^2 { i}(\\lambda , v_z(\\rho,\\theta),\\mu)}{\\partial \\lambda^2 } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "to proceed , it is crucial to decouple the rotation velocity and the wavelength to end up with expressions for the weak field approximation in terms of the observed fluxes . in order to do that",
    ", we assume that the shape of the local absorption profile is independent of the position on the stellar surface , apart from the doppler shift introduced by @xmath42 , and that the clv is wavelength independent . furthermore ,",
    "if we assume that the absorption profile is gaussian , we end up with : @xmath45\\right ] , \\label{eq : intensity_gaussian}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 stands for the continuum intensity , @xmath47 for the line depth , and @xmath48 for the line width .",
    "this approximation is not appropriate for stars with large radial temperature and density gradients because the lines close to the limb will differ strongly from the lines at the disk center .",
    "apart from the gaussian shape , it is possible to work with voigt functions but the subsequent expressions turn out to be more complicated and no new physics is gained , so we prefer to stick with the gaussian shape .",

    "all the functions needed in the previous equations are well behaved and can be computed numerically without much complexity .",
    "the main difficulty resides on the fact that , if the rotation velocity @xmath143 is large , the convergence of the expansion in eqs .",

    "the main problem is that the hermite polynomials grow in amplitude while the coefficients decrease slow .",
    "only after many terms ( the number of which depend on the ratio between the rotation velocity and the broadening ) , the coefficients start to compensate for the increase in the amplitude of the hermite polynomials and convergence is eventually obtained .",
    "this is a well - known defect of the gram - charlier expansion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when the rotation velocity is much larger than the doppler width of the local spectral line ( larger than a factor @xmath144 ) , the compensation between the amplitude increase of the hermite polynomials and the coefficients of the series expansion occurs for very large values of @xmath56 [ see eqs .",

    "( [ eq : averages_surface ] ) can be extended to much larger values of @xmath56 .",
    "the advantage of using the modified @xmath148 hermite polynomials is that their amplitude grow much slower with @xmath56 than @xmath55 due to the inclusion of the term @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "this facilitates the computation of each term in the expansions without numerical overflows .",
    "we note that the hermite polynomials are computed using their recursion relations @xcite .    from the computational point of view , once the rotation angular velocity of the star is set , the wavelength dependence of eqs .",

    "given our assumptions ( weak - field , weak - line , fixed center - to - limb variation , global dipolar field ) , one of the most direct applications of our equations is to study the magnetism of hot stars .",
    "for this reason , we use typical values of the broadening and rotation velocity of such stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : examples ] two examples for a dipolar magnetic field with different field configurations .",

    "the artificial selected spectral line is centered at @xmath157   and has an effective land factor of @xmath9 and its equivalent for linear polarization of @xmath158 . since the magnetic field takes its maximum value at the poles , the spectral line can be safely considered in the weak - field regime .",
    "the line broadening is set to 0.1  , typical of an observation at a spectral resolution of @xmath159 of a line with a microturbulent width of @xmath115 km s@xmath156 .",

    "our scheme is presently not applicable to fast rotators with narrow local absorption profiles .",
    "the computed intensity flux normalized to the continuum flux is shown in the upper panel of each figure .",
    "it is independent of the phase since , under the weak field regime , the intensity does not depend on the magnetic field and we have assumed that the star is structureless .",
    "however , it takes into account the rotation broadening and the presence of a clv .",
    "concerning the linear polarization fluxes , we see maximum amplitudes around 0.02% , while this increases to values around 100 times larger for circular polarization .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that linear polarization appears only in second order .",
    "we have generalized the expressions for the stokes parameters in the weak - field weak - line regime to the stellar case in which rotation is taken into account .",
    "this produces an intensity flux profile that is broadened by rotation while it is insensitive to the magnetic field . as a consequence , our formalism",
    "can only be applied to stars in which the intensity profile is not observed to be modulated by rotation .",
    "however , the circular and linear polarized fluxes are sensitive to the topology of the magnetic field .",
    "we have demonstrated that the inclusion of doppler shifts generates a dependence of circular polarization of the intensity flux itself , and not only on its wavelength derivative . likewise , the linear polarization profiles depend now on the first and second wavelength derivative and on the intensity flux itself .",
    "we have verified also that the expressions developed in this paper simplify to those obtained by @xcite in the non - rotating dipole case .",

    "the extension to a more general multipolar magnetic field is relatively easy and can be done fast if analytical expressions for the angular and radial integrals exist . in subsequent papers of this series",
