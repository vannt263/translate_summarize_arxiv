    "there are many minor bodies in the solar system beyond the orbit of jupiter , the transjovian objects ( tjos ) .",
    "there are several populations of tjos .",
    "these include the centaurs , a collection of objects that orbits between jupiter and neptune ; the kuiper belt , a reservoir of bodies such as pluto orbiting 30 - 50 au from the sun ; the scattered disc objects , a lower density population ( among them , eris ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that extends out to 100 - 200 au ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and the oort cloud , a population of comets that is generally believed to mostly reside tens of thousands of aus from the inner solar system , but includes objects like sedna that orbit hundreds of au away @xcite . the tjos formed out of the debris left over after planet formation , and their physical properties potentially contain information about the early solar system .",
    "their orbits also record the effects of gravitational perturbations from the planets , and constrain models of solar system dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    because the tjos are in the distant reaches of the solar system , our ability to observe and understand them is limited .",
    "large tjos can be directly observed with telescopes ; following the early discovery of pluto , other large tjos were found with surveys starting in the 1990s ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these big objects have been studied intensely with photometry and spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "pluto itself , and possibly more distant kuiper belt objects , will be visited by the _ new horizons _",
    "probe , which will increase our understanding of tjos @xcite . however , tjos with radii of a kilometre or less are far more difficult to observe .",
    "general constraints on the amount of mass in small bodies can be found from the level of cmb anisotropies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the brightness of the infrared background @xcite , and the gamma - ray background @xcite .",
    "the main method of searching for these small objects is through stellar occultations , when they pass in front of a background star , blocking and diffracting its light ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "at least two tjos were detected with this method in the past few years @xcite .",
    "the fresnel scale for objects in the outer solar system is @xmath1 .",
    "objects larger than @xmath2 essentially cast a geometrical shadow on the earth , while smaller objects cast a diffraction pattern on the earth as wide as @xmath2 , with the star s magnitude fluctuations set by the size of the occulter .    observing these events",
    "poses several challenges .",
    "first , the depth of the fluctuations for the smaller tjos is typically only of order a few percent .",
    "second , because the earth moves with a relative speed of up to @xmath3 with respect to tjos , the events last only a fraction of a second .",
    "high quality light curves must be therefore sampled with a frequency 5  100 hz ( cf . , @xcite , hereafter n07 ) .",
    "past and present surveys for tjo occultations include taos , the taiwanese american occultation survey , which is dedicated to detecting tjo occultations @xcite ; additionally , surveys have been carried out on the mmt observatory @xcite , the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system 1 ( ps1 ) telescope @xcite , the very large telescope @xcite , and hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "additional searches for occultations of sco x-1 in the x - ray band have been conducted , but instrumental effects proved troublesome ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . historically , a big problem with the occultation method in visible light is scintillation noise , which dominates fluctuations at short frequencies .",
    "the technique therefore requires large telescopes with high frequency sampling , and must deal with scintillation by either having a large signal - to - noise ratio @xcite , using multiple telescopes as a veto @xcite , or using space telescopes to eliminate it altogether @xcite .",
    "many of these conditions are fulfilled by the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , which are among the largest optical telescopes in the world .",
    "cherenkov telescopes are used to detect tev gamma - rays by imaging the flash of cherenkov light emitted by particle showers created when the gamma ray hits the upper atmosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the flashes are faint , so the cherenkov telescopes must be large to collect as many photons as possible ( see table  [ table : iactarrays ] ) .",
    "in addition , the cherenkov flashes are very short , only a few nanoseconds long , so cherenkov telescopes use photomultipliers or silicon photon detectors to sample fluxes on mhz time - scales .",
    "the optical field of view of a cherenkov telescopes is a few degrees .",
    "finally , cherenkov telescopes often come in arrays , allowing them to image a particle shower in three dimensions , but this could also be useful for vetoing occultation false positives .",
    "cherenkov telescopes achieve this remarkable performance at a low cost by sacrificing angular resolution : the typical point spread function ( psf ) of a cherenkov telescope is a few arcminutes @xcite .",
    "this increases the noise of a source because of blending with more sky background .",
    "however , for the brightest sources ( with @xmath4 ) , the poisson noise of the star is greater than the sky background noise , and confusion only becomes a problem at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cherenkov telescopes may be very useful for observing bright stars .",
    "cherenkov telescopes have been used to study the crab pulsar optical light curve @xcite , optical transients on millisecond and microsecond time - scales @xcite , and for optical seti @xcite , and they are potentially good for stellar intensity interferometry @xcite , detecting picosecond optical transients @xcite and optical polarimetry @xcite .",
    "current cherenkov telescope arrays include the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ) and the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) ( see table  [ table : iactarrays ] ) .",
    "veritas consists of four 12-meter telescopes and is located in the northern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "hess is an array of four 12-meter telescopes plus a central , fifth 28-meter telescope , located in the southern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "the power of cherenkov telescopes will increase much further with the next generation cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) .",
    "the array will include four large ( @xmath6 ) telescopes , as well as tens of medium ( @xmath7 ) and small ( @xmath8 ) telescopes @xcite .",
    "the sheer number of telescopes will allow a vast number of photons to be collected , and would efficiently eliminate false positives .",
    "the precise observations of stellar occultations that are possible with cherenkov telescopes can be useful for studying not only the tjos themselves but the occulted stars .",
    "the shape of the light curve depends on the size of the tjo , as well as the angular size of the star , in units of the fresnel scale .",
    "an array of telescopes , by sampling the light curve at different positions , could measure the size of the diffraction pattern , giving the fresnel scale , from which these parameters and the tjo distance can be calculated .",
    "besides these parameters , the arrays can measure the position of the tjo on the sky , and the non - radial components of the tjo velocity .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + i assume a field of view of @xmath9 for all telescopes .",
    "i also assume that occultations of all @xmath10 stars are as detectable as for a @xmath10 , @xmath11 a0v star , and that 7% of all occultations of @xmath12 stars are as detectable as for a @xmath12 , @xmath13 b5v star .",

    "the `` classical belt '' of these objects includes those with nearly circular orbits in the ecliptic with semimajor axes of @xmath14 .",
    "kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) can also be in orbital resonance with neptune , as pluto is .",
    "kbos are the only population of tjos for which there have been convincing occultations observed @xcite .",
    "the size distribution function of kbos is fairly well known . at the large object end",
    ", it is inferred from direct observations of their brightnesses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the many surveys for kbo occultations have placed strong limits on the abundance of objects with radii between @xmath15 and 1 km @xcite .",
    "the two occultations detected by hst have finally pinned down the abundance of small kbos @xcite .",
    "the evidence points to a broken power law distribution , with an exponent @xmath16 for radii up to 45 km , above which the distribution steepens .",
    "since large kbos have low inclinations , it is thought that small kbos are also concentrated towards the ecliptic .",
    "according to @xcite , the number density of kbos with @xmath17 is @xmath18 if the kbos are uniformly distributed at ecliptic latitudes @xmath19 .",
    "i use this surface density and @xmath20 .",
    "the kbos are assumed to be uniformly distributed between 42 and 45 au with @xmath21 .",
    "i find that iact arrays detect kbo occultations frequently , of order once per @xmath22 hours for @xmath23 stars when observing fields within @xmath19 at opposition , using the star counts near the galactic poles ( table  [ table : eventratesperarray ] ) .",
    "the large event rate is due to their sensitivity to the numerous small objects , combined with the large field of view .",
    "high quality occultations of the `` bright '' stars occur about once every 100 hours per observations of fields near the ecliptic .",
    "note that the region inhabited by kbos , @xmath19 , covers about 1/3 of the celestial sphere .",
    "the centaurs are former kbos that have been scattered into unstable orbits between jupiter and neptune .",
    "since the lifetime of the centaur orbits is only a few myr , there are a lot fewer of these objects than kbos at any given time .",
    "however , they are nearer to earth and more easily detected .",
    "@xcite extrapolated the observed number of centaurs down to a radius of @xmath24 . for a uniform inclination distribution with @xmath25",
    ", they estimate the surface density is @xmath26 with @xmath20 or @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the distance distribution function has a slope @xmath29 ; where i take @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "if the centaurs have a shallow size distribution of @xmath20 , then observable occultations are fairly rare , occurring once every few hundred hours at opposition for @xmath10 stars in fields near the ecliptic .",
    "hess and veritas typically accumulate 1000 hours of dark sky observations per year , so we may expect these occultations to be observed at most about once a year .",
    "just as some kbos have been scattered inwards to become centaurs , others have been scattered outwards .",
    "these scattered disc objects ( sdos ) have perihelia near 40 au but big eccentricities and inclinations , with some ranging out to 100 au .",
    "whether they were ejected from the kuiper belt early in the solar system s history or through the present time is unclear . in this paper ,",
    "i simply consider sdos to be a population of objects that spans @xmath32 to @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite estimates that there are 30000 sdos with perihelia less than 36 aus and radii greater than 50 km .",
    "according to @xcite , the total number of large sdos with any perihelion is twice this number .",
    "if the sdos are distributed isotropically on the sky , this gives @xmath35 at @xmath36 .",
    "i extrapolate to smaller sizes by assuming @xmath20 .",
    "sdo occultations are rarer than kbo occultations , but appear to be more common that centaur occultations if @xmath20 for both populations .",
    "iact arrays observe sdo occultations of @xmath10 stars roughly once every few hundred hours ( table  [ table : eventratesperarray ] ) .      the greatest reservoir of minor icy bodies , the oort cloud is thought to lie well beyond direct observation , at 1000 to 100000 au away .",
    "the 10000 au aphelia of long period comets is an indirect hint that objects exist at these distances .",
    "the oort cloud was likely formed by the outer planets as they cleared out the early solar system . for a long time",
    ", the oort cloud was thought to have two populations : an outer `` classical '' oort cloud ( @xmath37 ) susceptible to perturbations of other stars , and an inner hills cloud within 20000 au that is generally unperturbed except by the closest stellar passages ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery of 90377 sedna , a large object with a perihelion of 76 au and an aphelion of 480 au , complicated this picture @xcite .",
    "the existence of sedna and similar bodies may indicate that interactions with other stars in the sun s birth cluster shaped the oort cloud , which may be actually compressed to within a few thousand au of the sun @xcite .",
    "i consider two populations of oort cloud objects .",
    "the first is a `` core '' of oort cloud bodies with orbits similar to sedna .",
    "previous limits on this population were set by taos @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", there are 11000 oort cloud core objects with radii greater than @xmath38 .",
    "if they are isotropically distributed across the sky , this gives @xmath39 .",
    "i assume the oort cloud core spans @xmath40 to @xmath41 with @xmath34 , and i consider @xmath20 and @xmath28 .",
    "the second is the hills cloud , as considered by @xcite .",
    "there are of order @xmath42 classical oort cloud objects with radii greater than @xmath24 , although the true number is very uncertain .",
    "given an isotropic distribution on the sky , @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite also quotes a distance distribution of @xmath44 between @xmath45 and @xmath46 from @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , although iacts are capable of detecting these objects , their distance works against them ( equation  [ eqn : occultationrate ] )",
    ". observable occultations of the oort cloud core bodies require tens of thousands of hours of observations if @xmath20 , which would take several decades of observational time .",
    "if @xmath28 , then only a few hundred hours with hess or cta may suffice .",
    "occultations by classical oort cloud objects are even rarer , with one in an iact array s field of view every few hundred thousand hours , requiring centuries of observation .",
    "a minor body can co - orbit with a planet if it is trapped at the l4 or l5 lagrangian points , located @xmath47 ahead or behind respectively of the planet .",
    "their orbits can remain stable for longer than the age of the solar system in some cases .",
    "the largest trojan population in the solar system is associated with neptune , which actually outnumbers the main asteroid belt @xcite .",
    "neptune trojans are observed at both the l4 and l5 points @xcite .",
    "although not nearly as numerous as neptune trojans , trojan bodies are also known to co - orbit with earth , mars , jupiter , and uranus ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; saturn may have a small trojan population as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the number of large neptune trojans is known from surveys presented in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the current estimate is that there are 400 bodies with radii greater than @xmath36 @xcite , with roughly half at l4 and half at l5 @xcite .",
    "the size distribution appears to break from @xmath48 to smaller @xmath49 below radii of 45 km , just as for kbos @xcite .",
    "the inclinations of neptune trojans can be up to @xmath50 , and each population spans @xmath51 in ecliptic longitude . with two populations ,",
    "this means that the surface density of large trojans is @xmath52 .",
    "i then consider extrapolations down to sub - kilometre sizes with @xmath20 and @xmath53 .",
    "i find that , when iact arrays observe fields where the trojans are at opposition , a detectable occultation of a @xmath10 star occurs once every @xmath54 hours if @xmath20 and once every @xmath22 hours if @xmath28 .",
    "these rates are only @xmath55 times slower than of the far more numerous kbos because the trojans are confined to a relatively small region of the sky , enhancing their surface density .",
    "the trailing ( l5 ) neptune trojans present a very interesting opportunity during the next few years .",
    "these bodies are currently in sagittarius , a region that hess frequently observes because it also hosts the galactic centre . in addition",
    ", this region has a much higher number of target stars than the galactic pole .",
    "although the large density of stars makes trojans difficult to detect with conventional observations , it is preferable for occultation detections",
    ". therefore , the likelihood of serendipitous discoveries by hess is relatively high .",
    "the orbits of neptune trojans are generally stable , but most possible saturn and uranus trojan orbits are unstable . as a result , the populations of saturn and uranus trojans are much smaller , and no saturn trojans have been detected @xcite .",
    "a few dynamically stable regions do exist and may host trojans @xcite .",
    "in addition , uranus can temporarily capture centaurs into trojan orbits @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of a single uranus trojan confirms that these objects exist @xcite . according to simulations also done by @xcite ,",
    "roughly 0.4% of centaurs at any given time are trapped into uranus trojan regions . in computing the uranus trojan occultation rate ,",
    "i therefore use the centaur size distribution function , but multiplied by 0.004 .",
    "i also assume that uranus trojans are trapped in two regions of @xmath56 .",
    "as is clear from table  [ table : eventratesperarray ] , the prospects for detecting occultations by uranus trojans are dim .",
    "detectable occultations of a @xmath10 star at opposition occur only once every @xmath57 hours of observations of uranus trojan regions if @xmath20 . even if @xmath28 , @xmath58 hours of observations are necessary .",
    "unless iact arrays dedicate a year of their observation time or more specifically uranus trojan regions , they are unlikely to set interesting constraints on the population .      ground - based observations of the past 15 years have revealed swarms of satellites orbiting tens of millions of km from each of the gas and ice giants .",
    "these are the irregular satellites , and they were probably originally captured from the kuiper belt .",
    "the collisional time scale for the irregular satellite swarms is relatively short , resulting in a shallow size distribution @xcite .",
    "there are relatively few irregular satellites around each planet , but unlike all of the other populations , they are all concentrated into a tiny sky area .",
    "stable orbits for irregular satellites can be found within 0.7 hill radii of the planet @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the irregular satellites are within about @xmath59 of the planet .",
    "this boosts the odds of seeing an occultation by a sub - kilometre satellite _ if _ the iact array specifically observes the region near the planet itself .",
    "there may be additional populations of quasi - satellites orbiting at several times the hill radius , especially around uranus and neptune , although no such objects are known yet @xcite .",
    "@xcite compares the size distribution functions of the gas giants .",
    "in contrast to the usual pattern of size distribution , jupiter , saturn , and uranus have shallow @xmath60 at large radii .",
    "surveys of the satellite systems of jupiter and saturn are complete enough to discern a break in the size distribution at 5 km . below this point , the size distribution steepens and is consistent with @xmath20 .",
    "the simulations of @xcite , in which these irregular satellite systems are the ruins of much larger systems after collisional grinding , imply that @xmath61 below 5 km .",
    "neptune s irregular satellites , at least those outside the orbit of nereid , appear to have a steeper size distribution ( @xmath62 ) to the limits of completeness , 20 km , but the statistics are very low @xcite .",
    "there are 9 known irregular satellites of uranus , with radii above 7 km .",
    "i consider three possible size distributions .",
    "the first ( the s06 distribution ) is that the size distribution is similar to those of the jovian and saturnian system ; with @xmath63 above @xmath64 and @xmath20 below that point . the second is a @xmath20 distribution at all radii below @xmath65 , and the third is @xmath28 below @xmath65 .",
    "i find the occultation rate depends strongly on which distribution is more accurate .",
    "if the s06 or @xmath20 distribution holds , then several hundred hours of observation of the region around uranus are necessary to detect an occultation of a @xmath10 star at opposition . however , if @xmath28 , the rates are more optimistic : a few tens of hours are sufficient to detect an occultation .",
    "the neptunian satellite system was catastrophically altered by the capture of triton ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is unclear whether triton and nereid should count as irregular satellites .",
    "there are 5 definitely irregular satellites with @xmath38 , and i also include nereid for a total of 6 .",
    "i again consider the s06 distribution with a break to @xmath20 at @xmath64 , and @xmath20 and @xmath28 distributions with @xmath38 .",
    "detectable occultations are even rarer for neptunian irregular satellites than for uranian irregular satellites if the s06 distribution always holds , with about a thousand hours of observation time dedicated to neptune required .",
    "if @xmath20 for all radii , though , then only about 100 hours of observation time of neptune is necessary to detect an occultation of a @xmath10 star . for @xmath28 ,",
    "which is currently consistent with data , then @xmath55 hours of observations of neptune yield an occultation by an irregular satellite .",
    "there is no tev gamma - ray science case for dedicated observations of uranus and neptune with iacts .",
    "none the less , a few nights of dark sky observations can rule out @xmath28 for small satellites .",
    "a limit on @xmath53 is especially interesting for neptune , where the satellite size distribution is very poorly understood @xcite .",
    "iact arrays are in many ways superior instruments for studying tjo occultations .",
    "their telescopes are enormous with great light collection areas and relatively little scintillation noise ; the telescopes come in arrays , allowing a veto of scintillation noise and potentially breaking the velocity - size - distance degeneracy ; the photon sampling rates are essentially infinite from the occultation perspective ; and their fields of view ( @xmath66 ) are large enough to observe dozens of stars at once .",
    "the disadvantages are large amounts of sky noise because of the poor angular resolution , too short baselines for tjo parameter estimation , and relatively low duty cycle because of moonlight .",
    "in addition , the current electronics of the pmts in iacts may not be suited for continuous photometry ; if they do not use the standard readout modes , there can be deadtime within the integration time ( benbow , private communication ) .",
    "i have shown that the already extant veritas and hess arrays are in principle capable of detecting occultations by sub - kilometre tjos .",
    "the two kbo occultations detected by the hst would have been easily detected by either of these arrays .",
    "hess , with its central 28 metre telescope , can detect more objects than veritas , but has comparable performance for parameter estimation . the greatest obstacle for these arrays",
    "is estimating @xmath2 .",
    "i estimate that they observe a kbo occultation of a @xmath10 star once every @xmath22 hours of near - ecliptic observations .",
    "the arrays could also detect a number centaurs and scattered disc objects during the course of a year , and are capable of setting interesting constraints on the number of neptune trojans and irregular satellites .",
    "much rarer occultations of blue @xmath12 stars occur at @xmath67 of the rate of the @xmath10 stars , but observations of these events are worthwhile , as they allow for precise determinations of the tjo size and distance",
    ".    the future cta will be an excellent facility for characterizing kbo occultations as it will include kilometre - long baselines",
    ". it should be able to detect objects with radii smaller than 100 metres in the kuiper belt , allowing it to explore the same parameter space as x - ray occultation searches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but with many more targets .",
    "cta also can detect 1 km radius objects out to several thousand aus , into the inner reaches of the oort cloud .",
    "even for an occultation of a @xmath10 star by a 250 metre radius kbo , cta will be able to constrain properties to within a few percent .    given the apparent great potential of these instruments , it would be worth considering more complex models .",
    "first , a better model of scintillation noise is desirable , as its properties for large telescopes are poorly understood , and it may be correlated on relevant time - scales @xcite .",
    "second , the iacts are so powerful that the assumptions of a uniformly bright star and a spherical object may be insufficient . a study of whether these instruments can constrain limb darkening , starspots , and the shape of the star and the occulting body should be carried out .",
    "finally , my estimates of the occultation rates are very crude ; a more advanced model of the stellar population as in @xcite would be useful .",

    "the lommel functions , as defined in @xcite , are @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a bessel function of the first kind . from equation",
    "[ eqn : lommeldef ] , we have : @xmath81 the bessel functions @xmath82 rise from zero at @xmath83 to a peak near @xmath84 , and then oscillate with a slowly declining amplitude .",
    "thus , we need to include @xmath85 terms where @xmath86 .",
    "however , the series converges rapidly for @xmath87 that are not equal to @xmath75 , because of the @xmath88 ratios in equation  [ eqn : lommeldef ] .",
    "furthermore , i calculate the necessary bessel terms using the gnu science library function gsl_sf_bessel_jn_array , which uses a recurrence relation that starts at the @xmath89 with the greatest @xmath90 and moves downward to @xmath91 .",
    "yet the values of @xmath89 are so near to zero for @xmath92 that the function can underflow , so we have to make sure that we start from some @xmath93 that is much greater than the minimum value of double precision numbers , @xmath94 .    for a desired precision @xmath95 , we can set an upper bound on the maximum @xmath90 of bessel terms that we need using the following approximation : @xmath96 using newton s method , i solve for the @xmath90 where this approximation gives @xmath97 ; the remaining terms are then insignificant .",
    "unfortunately , equation  [ eqn : japprox ] is only an upper bound , and the estimated @xmath82 becomes much larger than the actual value when @xmath98 .",

    "the actual value of @xmath103 , so there is no risk of underflow .    beyond the shadow s edge , @xmath104 is even larger , and even higher order bessel functions have significant values .",
    "however , i cut off the series expansion at @xmath105 .",
    "this has no effect on the calculated diffraction patterns : the @xmath85th term is @xmath106 .",
    "thus , these terms are no larger than when @xmath78 .",
    "second , we need to be sure our spacing in @xmath87 resolves the shadow s edge . for @xmath107 , @xmath68 transitions from nearly 0 to nearly 1 in a very narrow interval .",
    "yet @xmath108 changes slowly , so the edge does not arise because of the bessel functions , but from the @xmath88 terms being taken to a high power .",
    "when @xmath78 , the largest term in the lommel function is where @xmath109 .",
    "the width of the shadow s edge is roughly defined by where this term is suppressed : @xmath110 thus , the model needs a resolution of @xmath111 .",
    "this is easily fulfilled by my models , since the largest @xmath100 and i use steps of @xmath112 .    _",
    "the distant fringes of the diffraction pattern _  the calculation of the diffraction pattern of objects much smaller than the fresnel scale presents its own complications . in this case , when @xmath113 , the diffraction pattern has the form : @xmath114\\ ] ] when @xmath115 .",
    "the smallest considered @xmath75 in this paper is a 10 meter radius object at @xmath116 au and @xmath117 .",
    "then @xmath118 and the approximation is valid to @xmath119 , far beyond the maximum @xmath87 of 15 that i considered .",
    "the monochromatic diffraction pattern of one of these objects occulting a point source is essentially a ringing of constant amplitude but with the period growing shorter the further from the centre .",
    "the period of the ringing is @xmath120 .",
    "note that the partial derivatives of @xmath68 with @xmath87 and @xmath75 have the same periods .",
    "what is actually measured , though , is these ringing patterns integrated over wavelength and a star s disc . since the fresnel scale changes with wavelength , the phases of the diffraction pattern at two wavelengths differ at large @xmath87 , resulting in interference and suppressing @xmath121",
    "likewise , when the width of the star s disc is greater than @xmath122 , the smearing of the diffraction pattern over different phases suppresses @xmath123 . as the wavelengths of photons detected by the pmt detectors of iacts can vary by a factor @xmath124 ,",
    "it is clear that the interference from the different patterns at these wavelengths suppresses the intensity of the diffraction pattern early on , at @xmath125 , no matter what @xmath75 is .",
    "so most of the power in the observed patterns is near the pattern s centre .",
    "although the signal observed by pmts is suppressed , it does not fall to zero immediately .",
    "the sensitivity of iacts is great enough to actually detect some of the signal even in these regions ( see figure  [ fig : crosssections ] ) .",
    "when integrating over wavelength and over the star s disc , the phase of the ringing must change by less than @xmath126 with each step in order to properly compute the amount of interference . failing to resolve the phase within the pattern results in spurious `` noise '' in the resulting diffraction pattern .",
    "this noise implies there is a signal where there is none , leading to incorrect detections .    when calculating @xmath121 , the fresnel scale changes from @xmath87 to @xmath127 as wavelength integrates from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "specifically , @xmath130 . to resolve the interference correctly",
    ", we need @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the necessary spectral resolution is @xmath132 in my models , i conservatively use a wavelength step of @xmath133 ^ 2)$ ] .",
    "likewise , when integrating over the stellar disc ( equation  [ eqn : istarintegral ] ) , @xmath131 : @xmath134 the necessary resolution in my models is @xmath135 ; the actual step size of @xmath136 is much smaller than this .",
    "i conclude that my model light curves have the correct amount of interference .",
    "note that calculating the diffraction pattern at high @xmath87 takes @xmath137 time , since the step size must decrease inversely with distance .",
