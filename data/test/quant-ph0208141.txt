    "the correspondence between classical and quantum dynamics of anharmonic systems has gained significant attention in the past few years @xcite .",
    "a short laser pulse impinging on an atom or a molecule excites a superposition of several stationary states , and the resulting wave packet follows the orbit of the corresponding classical particle in the initial stage of the time evolution .",
    "however , the nonequidistant nature of the involved energy spectra causes peculiar quantum effects , broadening of the initially well localized wave packets , revivals and partial revivals @xcite .",
    "partial revivals are in close connection with the formation of schrdinger - cat states , which , in this context , are coherent superpositions of two spatially separated , well localized wave packets @xcite",
    ". phase space description of vibrational schrdinger - cat state formation using animated wigner functions can be found in @xcite . however , these highly nonclassical states are expected to be particularly sensitive to decoherence @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze the process of decoherence for the spontaneously formed schrdinger - cat states in the anharmonic potential .",
    "we consider the decoherence model which relies on the interaction of the quantum system ( _ s _ ) with its environment ( _ e _ ) that has many degrees of freedom .",

    "s__e _ entanglement and the reduced density operator @xmath2 where @xmath3 means a trace over the environmental degrees of freedom , turns into a mixture . assuming negligibly short relaxation times in the environment , one obtains a markovian master equation which is a useful tool for the dynamical investigation of the environment induced decoherence .",
    "it allows for the determination of pointer states @xcite , that is , states that are favored by decoherence @xcite , and also for the calculation of the characteristic time of decoherence for different initial states @xcite .    in the following we introduce a master equation that takes into account the fact that in a general anharmonic system the relaxation rate of each energy eigenstate is different",
    "this master equation is applied to the case of wave packet motion in the morse potential that is often used to describe a vibrating diatomic molecule . considering the phase - space description of decoherence",
    ", we show how the phase portrait of the system reflects the damping of revivals in the expectation values of the position and momentum operators due to the effect of the environment .",
    "we also calculate and plot the time evolution of the wigner function corresponding to the reduced density operator of the morse system .",
    "the wigner function picture visualizes the fact that although our master equation reduces to the amplitude damping equation @xcite in the harmonic limit , the anharmonic effects lead to a decoherence scheme which is similar to the phase relaxation @xcite of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) .",
    "it is found that the reduced density operator that arises due to the decoherence can be identified with a mixture of states that are well - localized in the phase space and equally distributed along the orbit of the corresponding classical particle .",
    "we illustrate the generality of this decoherence scheme by presenting the time evolution of an energy eigenstate as well .",

    "smaller initial displacements correspond to classical phase space orbits with smaller diameter .",
    "consequently the quantum interference related to nonclassical states that are formed during the course of time cover a smaller area in the phase - space in this case .",
    "this means that our result is a manifestation of the general feature of decoherence that increasing the `` parameter of nonclassicality '' , which is the diameter of the corresponding classical orbit in our case , causes faster decoherence @xcite .",

    "then , in the initial stage of the time evolution , the positive hill corresponding to the wave packet @xmath59 follows the orbit of the classical particle that has started from @xmath99 at @xmath100 .",

    "@xcite for similar results with the husimi @xmath101 function . ) after a certain time the increasingly broadened wave packet becomes able to interfere with itself , and around the quarter revival time one can observe two positive hills chasing each other at the opposite sides of the classical orbit .",
    "the strong oscillations of @xmath102 between the hills represent the quantum correlation of the constituents of this molecular schrdinger - cat state @xcite .",

    "therefore the scheme of the decoherence is qualitatively different for the harmonic and anharmonic oscillators : our results in the anharmonic system are similar to the phase relaxation in the harmonic case @xcite , where the energy of the system remains unchanged , but the phase information is completely destroyed .",
