    "one of the most sensitive probes of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is provided by neutral gauge boson self couplings @xcite . in the sm , trilinear and quartic neutral gauge boson couplings ( tngbcs and qngbcs )",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , vanish at tree level and their radiative corrections are known to be rather small , of the order of @xmath7 - @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "deviations from the sm predictions for tngbcs and qngbcs might point to new interactions such as those arising from strongly - interacting electroweak models @xcite , a fourth family of chiral fermions with sm assignments of quantum numbers @xcite , and the heavy fermions arising in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite",
    ". an interesting feature of qngbcs involving at least one photon field stems from the fact that they are genuine in the sense that arise from effective operators that do not induce any trilinear gauge boson coupling .",
    "therefore these genuine qngbcs must be constrained from processes other than the ones used to constrain trilinear gauge boson couplings , such as boson - pair fusion or triple - boson production @xcite .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case of the quartic @xmath9 coupling , which can arise from operators that also induce the trilinear @xmath10 coupling , which means that any constraint on the latter can be immediately translated into a bound on the former .",
    "furthermore , while the quartic neutral @xmath11 coupling can be induced at tree - level , for instance by the exchange of a heavy scalar boson , qngbcs involving at least one photon field can only arise at one - loop level or higher order in any renormalizable theory because of electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "in particular , qngbcs have been constrained from the cern @xmath12 collider lep-2 data on triple gauge boson production @xcite .",
    "considerable work has also been devoted to the analysis of qngbcs through different processes at the next linear @xmath12 collider as well as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and hadron colliders @xcite .    in this note we will present a detailed calculation of the @xmath1 coupling contribution to the rare decay @xmath15 . the current experimental limit on this decay mode @xcite",
    "will then be used to constrain the coefficients of this qngbc .",
    "to our knowledge , this calculation has never been presented in the literature .",
    "our analysis will proceed in the same line as those presented in our previous works @xcite , where we obtained bounds on tngbcs from the @xmath16 decay mode @xcite and on neutrino - photon interactions from @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we will find that the bounds obtained in this way rely on very few assumptions , though they are weaker than the ones obtained from the analysis of @xmath18 and @xmath19 data at lep-2 @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we present a short description of the effective lagrangian for the @xmath1 coupling .",
    "section iii is devoted to present the calculation of the rare decay @xmath0 .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "when parametrizing physics beyond the fermi scale in a model - independent manner by means of the effective lagrangian technique there are two alternatives , i.e. the underlying new physics can be assumed to be either of decoupled or nondecoupled nature @xcite . in the decoupling scenario it is assumed that the higgs mechanism is realized in nature , thereby requiring the existence of at least one ( relatively ) light higgs boson . in this case",
    "the low - energy theory is renormalizable _  la _ dyson , the decoupling theorem remains valid , and the effective lagrangian is constructed out of operators respecting the @xmath20 symmetry linearly . in this scenario",
    "the virtual heavy physics effects can not affect dramatically the low - energy processes : the impact of new physics might become important only in those processes that are absent or very suppressed within the sm @xcite . on the other hand , another possibility ( the nondecoupling scenario )",
    "arises if the higgs boson is very heavy or does not exist at all .",
    "there follows that the low - energy theory is nonrenormalizable due to the absence of the higgs boson .",
    "this class of new physics can be assumed to be responsible for the symmetry breaking of the electroweak sector . in this scenario",
    "the @xmath21 symmetry is nonlinearly realized@xcite .",
    "the lowest - dimension operators that induce the @xmath22 coupling have dimension six ( eight ) in the nonlinear ( linear ) realization .",
    "this means that any new physics effects arising from this coupling are likely to become more evident in the nonlinear scenario since in the linear one they are suppressed by higher powers of the new physics scale @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , in this work we will concentrate on the nonlinear scenario .",
    "furthermore , only those operators that respect the custodial @xmath24 and the discrete @xmath25 and @xmath26 symmetries will be considered .",
    "it turns out that the operators that violate the custodial symmetry are tightly constrained by the @xmath27 parameter . in the nonlinear scenario",
    "there are fourteen dimension - six operators that induce the @xmath22 coupling at tree level @xcite .",
    "this was discussed to a large extent in ref .",
    "@xcite and we will not dwell on this issue here .",
    "we rather focus on the lorentz structure induced for the @xmath1 coupling . in the unitarity gauge ( @xmath28 )",
    ", there are only two independent lorentz structures for this coupling induced by dimension - six operators @xcite :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we have followed closely the notation introduced in @xcite . below we will proceed to compute the decay @xmath32 using the above effective interaction .",
    "the experimental limit on this decay will then be used to constrain the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we now turn to outline the calculation of the decay width for @xmath35 , which is somewhat similar to the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the rare decay @xmath36 in two higgs doublet models , with @xmath37 the @xmath38-odd neutral scalar . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the experimental bound on the rare @xmath35 decay was used to constrain the neutrino - photon interactions @xmath39 and @xmath40 . here",
    "we will make an analysis along the same lines but focus on the purely bosonic @xmath1 coupling , which contributes to the @xmath41 decay through the feynman diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ znngg ] .",
    "contribution from the effective @xmath1 coupling to the rare @xmath42 decay.,width=240 ]    the 4-vectors of the participating particles will be denoted as follows @xmath43 .",
    "the feynman rule for the effective vertex @xmath44 is straightforwardly obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eflag ] ) :    @xmath45\\bigg\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where all the momenta are directed inward .",
    "the decay width can then be written as    @xmath46    with @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . by the usual method and after a lengthy calculation we can obtain the squared amplitude .",
    "it reads    @xmath51    where we have introduced the definition    @xmath52    with @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in eq .",
    "( [ mcuad ] ) a factor of 3 is included in the denominator as we are averaging over the @xmath55 boson polarizations ; also , a factor of 2 has been introduced to account for two identical particles in the final state .",
    "the integration over @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be carried out straightforwardly with the aid of the following result @xcite    @xmath58    where @xmath59 .",
    "once we are done with the integration over @xmath56 and @xmath57 , there still remains to integrate over @xmath60 and @xmath48 . to this end",
    "we will work in the center of mass frame of the @xmath55 boson .",
    "we find it useful to define the following variables @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "the decay width can thus be expressed as    @xmath64    where    @xmath65    and    @xmath66    it can be shown that the integration region @xmath67 is given by @xcite    @xmath68    together with @xmath69 .",
    "after numerical integration we are left with    @xmath70    with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , if lepton universality is assumed , eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) is to be multiplied by 3 to account for all of the known neutrino species . from the lep-2 data , the l3 collaboration set the following limit on @xmath0 @xcite    @xmath73    assuming that either @xmath74 or @xmath75 is dominant we obtain the following bounds    @xmath76    which are weaker than those obtained at lep-2 from @xmath77 and @xmath78 production @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to note that the bounds based on the latter processes do not agree , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , which means that much work along these lines is still required . in general eqs .",
    "( [ result ] ) and ( [ expbound ] ) yield an allowed area in the @xmath33 versus @xmath34 plane , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ area ] .",
    "allowed area ( gray region ) in the @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 plane from the experimental bound on the @xmath79 rare decay.,width=240 ]    we can also take a different approach and instead of bounding the @xmath1 coupling , we may use the most stringent bounds on it to predict its contribution to the @xmath0 decay . from the most stringent experimental bound on the @xmath33 and @xmath34 coefficients , of the order of @xmath80-@xmath81 @xcite",
    ", it follows a limit on the contribution of the @xmath1 coupling to the @xmath0 decay :    @xmath82    this indirect bound is above than the one found for the contribution of the neutrino - one - photon interaction @xmath39 , which is of the order of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "in closing it is interesting to note that the @xmath1 coupling also contributes to the rare decay @xmath84 , for which an experimental bound has already been set @xcite .",
    "this rare decay mode also receives contributions from the quartic @xmath85 coupling .",
    "therefore it would be possible , in principle , to use this rare decay to bound such qngbcs .",
    "as far as the @xmath85 coupling is concerned , a tighter bound on it can be obtained from the three - body decay @xmath86 .",
    "the latter , together with the @xmath87 reaction , have been studied within the effective lagrangian approach @xcite and we will not repeat the same analysis here . from the result presented in ref .",
    "@xcite a bound on the effective @xmath85 vertex can be derived , which is of the same order of magnitude of the one obtained in this work for the @xmath1 coupling .",
    "finally we would like to emphasize that the importance of studying qngbcs is rooted in the fact that they have a different origin than tngbcs , i.e. they are induced by effective operators that do not induce any tngbc . in this work",
    "we have found a constraint on the @xmath1 coupling from the @xmath88 decay mode , which is weaker than the bounds derived from the analysis of @xmath77 and @xmath78 production at lep-2 .",
    "this is explained from the fact that the decay @xmath89 has a suppression factor due to the virtual @xmath55 boson propagator , which suffers less suppression when the initial @xmath55 boson is allowed to be off - shell .",
