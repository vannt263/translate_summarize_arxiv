    "the energy budget of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) provides fundamental insight into the nature of the explosions , the resulting ejecta properties , and the identity of the central compact remnant ( `` engine '' ) .",
    "while the isotropic - equivalent @xmath5-ray energy ( @xmath8 ) can be easily determined from a measurement of the burst fluence and redshift , a complete accounting of the energy budget requires detailed observations of the afterglow emission .",
    "the afterglow observations provide a measure of the isotropic - equivalent blastwave kinetic energy ( @xmath9 ) , as well as the explosion geometry ( quantified by a jet opening angle , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the resulting beaming corrections , @xmath11 , can be substantial , approaching three orders of magnitude in some cases @xcite . to properly determine @xmath12 and @xmath13 it is essential to observe the afterglows from radio to x - rays over timescales of hours to weeks , clearly a challenging task .",
    "this is particularly a problem for the subset of `` dark '' grbs for which the lack of detected optical emission , or large extinction , prevent a determination of @xmath9 and likely @xmath13 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    over the past decade",
    "detailed afterglow observations have been obtained at a great cost of telescope time for about @xmath14 long - duration grbs , with the basic result that the beaming corrections are large and diverse , leading to typical true energies of @xmath15 erg @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been recognized that some nearby long grbs have much lower energies , @xmath16 erg , and appear to be quasi - isotropic @xcite .",
    "similarly , some bursts appear to have large beaming - corrected energies of @xmath17 erg @xcite .",
    "the existence of these highly energetic bursts depends at least in part on the ability to correctly infer their large beaming corrections .",
    "indeed , the inference of jet opening angles from breaks in the afterglow light curves has become controversial in recent years due to conflicting trends in optical and x - ray light curves @xcite .",
    "similarly , in some cases a two - component jet has been inferred , with a narrow core dominating the @xmath5-ray emission and a wider component dominating the afterglow emission @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that off - axis viewing angles can also lead to shallow breaks that may be missed or mis - interpreted @xcite .",
    "in addition to potential difficulties with the inference of @xmath13 , the @xmath5-ray and kinetic energies measured from the early afterglow emission only pertain to the relativistic ejecta .",
    "the existence of a substantial component of mildly relativistic ejecta can only be determined from observations at late times when such putative material can refresh the forward shock .",
    "clearly , the existence of substantial energy in a slow ejecta component will place crucial constraints on the activity lifetime of the central engine .",
    "such late - time observations also have the added advantage that they probe the blastwave when it has decelerated to non - relativistic velocities and hence roughly approaches isotropy @xcite .",
    "this allows us to use the well - established sedov - taylor self - similar solution , with negligible beaming corrections , to estimate the total kinetic energy of both the decelerated ejecta and any additional initially non - relativistic material . since the peak of the afterglow spectrum on these timescales",
    "is located in the radio band , the lack of optical afterglow emission ( e.g. , due to extinction ) does not have an effect on the ability to determine @xmath18 .",
    "this approach was first exploited by @xcite to model the late - time radio afterglow emission of grb970508 ( at @xmath19 d ) from which the kinetic energy was inferred to be @xmath20 erg .",
    "@xcite used the same approach to model the radio afterglow emission of grb980703 on timescales of @xmath21 d , and to re - model grb970508 .",
    "they found kinetic energies of @xmath22 erg for both bursts .",
    "finally , @xcite modeled the radio emission from grb030329 at @xmath23 d and found @xmath24 erg .",
    "only 3 bursts have been studied in this fashion so far because only those events have well - sampled radio light curves on the relevant timescales of @xmath25 d.    however , the kinetic energy can still be estimated using the same methodology even from fragmentary late - time radio observations .",
    "such an approach will naturally result in larger uncertainties for each burst , but it can be applied to a much larger sample of events . here",
    "we present such an analysis for @xmath0 long - duration grbs with radio observations at @xmath26 d , but with only @xmath27 data points ( at 1.4 to 8.5 ghz ) per burst .",
    "using these observations we infer robust ranges for the kinetic energy of each burst and for the population as a whole .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the radio observations are summarized in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the model for synchrotron emission from a sedov - taylor blastwave , and the various assumptions we employ are presented in ",
    "[ sec : model ] . in  [ sec : res ] we detail the resulting kinetic energies and the range for the overall sample , and we compare these results to multi - wavelength analyses of early afterglows in  [ sec : comp ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of future prospects .",
    "we use radio observations of @xmath0 long grbs at @xmath28 d since on those timescales the blastwave is expected to become non - relativistic and roughly isotropic @xcite , and the peak of the afterglow emission is at or below the centimeter band .",
    "this has been confirmed with detailed data in the case of grbs 970508 , 980703 , and 030329 @xcite .",
    "we restrict the analysis to grbs with a known redshift and with early - time detections , which for the case of a single detection or upper limit allow us to infer that the peak of the spectrum has transitioned below our observing frequency .",
    "the observations are primarily from the very large array ( vla ) , with the exception of grbs 980425 and 011121 which were observed with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the data were obtained between 1997 and 2009 as part of a long - term grb radio program ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for the purpose of our analysis , we separate the bursts into three categories based on the quality of the data . in group a are 3 bursts with late - time detections at multiple frequencies that constrain the peak of the synchrotron spectrum ( the same three bursts that have been studied in detail by @xcite ) . in group b",
    "are 11 bursts with single - frequency detections , while group c consists of 10 grbs with late - time non - detections .",
    "the vla measurements and relevant burst properties are listed in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "our modeling of the radio data follows the methodology of @xcite and @xcite for the case of a uniform density medium . for the typical expected parameters of long grbs , the initially collimated blastwave approaches spherical symmetry and decelerates to non - relativistic velocity on similar timescales , @xmath29 d and @xmath30 d , respectively @xcite ; here , @xmath31 is the circumburst density in units of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the `` jet break '' time at which the jet begins to expand sideways ( i.e. , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the bulk lorentz factor ) . in this paper",
    "we assume that the blastwave has transitioned to the non - relativistic isotropic phase by the time of our observations and subsequently check for self - consistency .",
    "the blastwave dynamics in the non - relativistic phase are described by the sedov - taylor self - similar solution with @xmath36 . to calculate the synchrotron emission emerging from the shock - heated material ,",
    "we make the usual assumptions : ( i ) the electrons are accelerated to a power - law energy distribution , @xmath37 for @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the minimum lorentz factor ; ( ii ) the value of @xmath40 is 2.2 as inferred from several bursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; and ( iii ) the energy densities in the magnetic field and electrons are constant fractions ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ) of the shock energy density .",
    "accounting for synchrotron emissivity and self - absorption , and including the appropriate redshift transformations , the flux observed at frequency @xmath43 and time @xmath44 is given by @xcite : @xmath45^{5/2}(1-e^{-\\tau_\\nu } ) f_3(\\nu/\\nu_m)f^{-1}_2(\\nu/\\nu_m),\\ ] ] where the optical depth is given by : @xmath46^{-(p+4)/2 } f_2(\\nu/\\nu_m),\\ ] ] the synchrotron peak frequency , corresponding to electrons with @xmath47 , is given by : @xmath48 and the function @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an integration over bessel functions @xcite .",
    "the temporal indices in the case of a uniform density medium are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the normalizations are such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the flux density and optical depth at a frequency of @xmath57 hz at @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the synchrotron peak frequency in the rest frame of burst at @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , the synchrotron self - absorption frequency , @xmath60 , is defined by the condition @xmath61 .",
    "we fit this synchrotron model to our radio data using @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath59 as free parameters .",
    "since we have no _ a priori _ knowledge about the expected values of the synchrotron spectrum parameters we assume that they follow a flat distribution in log - space .",
    "we note that any further assumption about the distribution of these parameters will only serve to restrict the resulting energy distributions , and we therefore consider our assumed flat distribution to be conservative . for the detected objects ( groups a and b )",
    "we retain all solutions that reproduce the measured flux density within the error bars , while for the non - detections we use @xmath62 as an upper bound .",
    "moreover , for the bursts in group a , @xmath59 is constrained by the multi - frequency observations and no additional constraints are required . however , for the bursts in groups b and c , which have only a single - frequency observation , we require that both @xmath63 and @xmath60 have values below the observing frequency since the light curves are always declining at the time of our observations .    using the allowed ranges of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath59 we determine the set of relevant physical parameters : @xmath31 , @xmath39 , and @xmath64 , where @xmath64 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "the radius of the blastwave , @xmath65 , remains unconstrained ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the luminosity distance in units of @xmath71 cm assuming the standard cosmological parameters ( @xmath72 km s@xmath73 mpc@xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ) , and @xmath76 is the reciprocal of the thickness of the emitting shell .    the unknown radius of the blastwave can be constrained by introducing a relationship between @xmath77^{-2}$ ] and the energy in the electrons and the magnetic field .",
    "we use the condition that at most half of the blastwave energy is available for accelerating electrons and producing the magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "the total energy in the accelerated electrons is @xmath79n_e\\gamma_mc^2v$ ] , while the energy in the magnetic field is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the volume of the synchrotron emitting shell .",
    "the energy budget is minimized near equipartition ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) , and we use this constraint to determine the minimum required energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; this conclusion was verified with radio interferometric measurements of the size of grb030329 @xcite .    finally , using the inferred radius for each possible solution , we require for self - consistency that @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "the resulting @xmath85 distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : beta ] .",
    "these results indicate that most of the detected bursts obey the self - consistency requirement , although we reject grbs 000926 , 020819 , and 021004 from the analysis since @xmath86 of their allowed solutions lead to relativistic velocities at the time of the observations .",
    "this does not rule out that the sedov - taylor solution is applicable , but simply indicates that additional observations are required to narrow down the range of allowed solutions .",
    "we furthermore find that the bulk of the upper limits do not rule out relativistic expansion , and we therefore do not use these limits in the energy distribution analysis below .",
    "the resulting solutions for each burst can be cast in terms of a two - dimensional parameter space in @xmath31 versus @xmath87 .",
    "thus , there is a degeneracy between the two parameters , in the sense that larger densities lead to lower energies . clearly , the bursts in group a , for which the peak of the synchrotron spectrum is well - determined , lead to the best constraints in this two - dimensional phase space . indeed , as shown for grb980703 ( figure  [ fig : examples ] ) , the allowed range of energies for all solutions that reproduce the observed flux density is about @xmath88 erg , while the solutions that also satisfy the requirements that @xmath89 span a much narrower range of about @xmath90 erg , with a roughly log - normal distribution centered on @xmath91 .",
    "the bursts with only single - frequency observations ( group b ) cover a much larger area in the @xmath92 phase - space since only an upper bound can be placed on @xmath63 and @xmath60 . to further constrain the energy we place an additional conservative constraint on the density of @xmath93 @xmath32 , motivated by the results of detailed broad - band modeling that show @xmath94 @xmath32 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . given the anti - correlation between density and energy , our conservative limits lead to a wider range of allowed energies than if we chose a limit of @xmath95 @xmath32 .",
    "an example of this additional constraint for a group b burst ( grb010921 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : examples ] .",
    "we do not place a lower bound on the density , since for the phase - space of allowed solutions this would not lead to a significant change in the energy distribution .",
    "we stress that beyond placing an upper bound on @xmath31 no constraints have been placed on the distributions of either @xmath31 or @xmath85 since both are inferred , and not input , parameters in our model .",
    "as noted above , we do not consider the energies for the bursts in group c since the upper limits generally allow a wide range of solutions that are not consistent with the sedov - taylor formulation .",
    "this indicates that the limits are generally not deep enough to provide a meaningful constraint on the energy .",
    "future deep radio observations may provide much better constraints ( see below ) .",
    "the resulting energy probability distributions for the bursts in group a and group b are shown in figure  [ fig : hist ] .",
    "the median energy and @xmath3 confidence range ( i.e. , @xmath96 of the distribution ) for each burst are listed in table  [ tab : energy ] .",
    "we include in these ranges the small subset of solutions that lead to @xmath85 values in slight excess of 1 since these are at most mildly relativistic and furthermore do not significantly change the distributions ( figure  [ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "we find that varying the electron power law index over the range @xmath97 ( e.g. , @xcite ) leads to a change in the median energy of only @xmath98 dex ( compared to our fiducial value of @xmath99 ) , with larger values of @xmath40 leading to lower median energies .",
    "similarly , varying the magnetic energy fraction away from equipartition to @xmath100 and @xmath101 , leads to an increae in the median energy of about 0.25 and 0.5 dex , respectively .",
    "both of these effects are much smaller than the overall spread in energy for each burst , but they do produce minor systematic trends .    the combined distribution for the subset of 11 bursts whose solutions are generally self - consistent is shown in figure  [ fig : eall ] .",
    "the median and @xmath3 confidence ranges are @xmath2 erg and @xmath4 erg .",
    "the key results of our analysis are that the median energy for the 11 bursts with self - consistent solutions is @xmath102 erg , while the @xmath3 confidence range is @xmath103 erg .",
    "the median value is about a factor of 3 times higher than previous calorimetric measurements for grbs 970508 , 980703 , and 030329 , for which energies of @xmath104 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 erg , respectively , were determined @xcite .",
    "similarly , the inferred energies are somewhat larger than the distributions of beaming - corrected @xmath5-ray and kinetic energies inferred from broad - band multi - epoch studies ( figure  [ fig : ecomp ] ) . from various such analyses , the median @xmath5-ray energy is @xmath106 erg @xcite , while the median kinetic energy is @xmath107 erg ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; see figure  [ fig : ecomp ] . in both cases the @xmath3 range spans about 2.5 orders of magnitude , somewhat narrower than our inferred @xmath3 confidence range for @xmath87 .",
    "the extension to larger energies found in our analysis mainly reflects the lack of spectral peak determinations for the bursts with single - frequency observations ( see figure  [ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "these large energies can be generally eliminated with a measurement of the synchrotron peak in the ghz frequency range ( e.g. , group a bursts ; figure  [ fig : ecomp ] ) .    in the context of our results we note that recent numerical work by @xcite led these authors to conclude that the timescale to reach isotropy is @xmath108 yr rather than @xmath109 yr as indicated by the analytic formulation of @xcite which we follow here . as a result",
    ", they note that using the sedov - taylor formulation may lead to an erroneous estimate of the kinetic energy .",
    "however , inspection of the resulting potential disrepancies reveals that this effect is at most a factor of 2 _ as long as self - consistency between the inferred energy and density and the transition to the sedov - taylor phase is ensured _ ( see their figure 10 ) .",
    "the discrepancies become larger if the wrong timescale is assumed for the transition to non - relativistic expansion , but this quantity is not a free parameter . indeed , our distributions of @xmath85 values point to self - consistency for most bursts , and allow us to reject objects that are potentially still relativistic . since the potential systematic uncertainty of about a factor of 2 is significantly smaller than the overall spread in allowed energy for each burst , we do not consider this to be an obstacle to our analysis , or to future work on the energy scale using late - time radio measurements .",
    "as clearly demonstrated in figure  [ fig : hist ] , the most constrained energy determinations require a measurement of the synchrotron spectral peak ( group a ) ; the absence of such a constraint requires additional assumptions about the circumburst density and results in a much wider energy range .",
    "indeed , this is the key reason for the wider range of allowed high energy solutions ( @xmath110 erg ) compared to the results for @xmath111 and @xmath18 ( figure  [ fig : ecomp ] )",
    ". observations of grbs 970508 , 980703 , and 030329 demonstrate that the spectral peak is typically located at @xmath112 ghz on a timescale of @xmath113 d. thus , observations in the @xmath114 ghz range on a timescale of @xmath115 hundred days should allow us to determine the peak flux and frequency .",
    "this will in turn provide an energy estimate with a similar level of precision to the results of early - time broad - band modeling .",
    "this is a fortuitous conclusion since with the full frequency coverage of the expanded vla ( evla ) it will soon be possible to cover this entire range in a few hours of observations to a sensitivity that is about an order of magnitude better than the vla . as we demonstrated here , such a modest investment of observing time ( @xmath116 hours per burst ) can yield a robust estimate of the grb energy distribution , _ regardless _ of the ability to measure jet opening angles .",
    "pursuing these observations for all bursts with a measured redshift will require only @xmath117 hr of evla time per year .",
    "indeed , with such observations we should be able to constrain the energy distribution to a comparable level as existing studies within a single year given that about 30 grbs with known redshifts just from 2009 are now available for evla observations ( a similar sample is available from 2008 bursts ) .",
    "in the longer term , the large number of objects will allow us to test the energy distribution as a function of redshift , at least over the range @xmath118 where the bulk of the detected bursts occur @xcite .",
    "similarly , this approach will be particularly useful for bursts that lack detailed optical or x - ray light curves due to observational constraints or dust extinction , and for bursts with controversial estimates of the jet opening angles .",

    "<S> this is due to bursts in our sample with only a single - frequency observation for which we can only determine an upper bound on the peak of the synchrotron spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this limitation leads to a wider range of allowed energies than for bursts with a well - measured spectral peak . </S>",
    "<S> our study indicates that single - epoch centimeter - band observations covering the spectral peak on a timescale of @xmath6 yr can provide a robust estimate of the total kinetic energy distribution with a small investment of telescope time . the substantial increase in bandwidth of the evla ( up to 8 ghz simultaneously with full coverage at @xmath7 ghz ) </S>",
    "<S> will provide the opportunity to estimate the kinetic energy distribution of grbs with only a few hours of data per burst . </S>"
