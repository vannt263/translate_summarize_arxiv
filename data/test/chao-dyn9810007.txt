    "recently there has been much progress in the study of synchronization of nonlinear maps @xcite and flows @xcite .",
    "this may lead to the clarification of the intelligence supposed to come from the synchronization among the neurons in the neural network , e.g.@xcite . especially the globally coupled map lattice ( gcml ) , a system of identical maps coupled via their mean field , has surprisingly rich clustering phases in the space of the nonlinearity parameter and the coupling . in the ordered two - cluster phase ,",
    "gcml exhibits a posi - nega switch between clusters of synchronizing maps controlled by external inputs@xcite .",
    "furthermore even in the turbulent regime there emerges some hidden correlation which was first observed as the violation of the law of large numbers ( lln ) in the fluctuation of the mean field in the time series@xcite .",
    "gcml is a natural extension of the spin - glass models@xcite and these interesting features may be relevant to the intelligence activity .",
    "all the maps in gcml contribute to the mean field with an equal weight and hence there is no notion of distance between maps .",
    "it is conjectured that the intriguing properties of gclm , both the posi - nega switch and the hidden coherence , come from this bona fide scaling invariance of gcml@xcite .",
    "however , neither the reason why there occurs complete swapping of the maps between clusters in the posi - nega switch in the two - cluster phase nor the global feature of the turbulent phase has been elucidated so far .",
    "the purpose of this article is twofold .",
    "firstly , we revisit gcml .",
    "we show that there is a natural mechanism which guarantees the complete swapping of maps in the two - cluster posi - nega switch .",
    "the key to this mechanism is the motion of the mean field during the transient process .",
    "we show that even though whole maps are released from tightly synchronizing clusters to chaotic violent movements during the transient process , still they never mix across their mean field .",
    "we clarify the mechanism for this phenomenon .",
    "we also perform an extensive survey of the turbulent regime of gcml .",
    "we show that this regime has a prominent period three window and is full of periodicity remnants .",
    "a correlator analysis detects quasi - periodic clusters with high mixing rate among them almost everywhere in the turbulent regime of the large - size gcml .",
    "the so - called hidden coherence occurs in - between the regions of the quasi - clusters and the valleys with no violation of lln as the most modest appearance of the periodicity remnants .",
    "secondly , we construct a new extended globally coupled map lattice ( egcml ) .",
    "our egcml is a two - dimensional map lattice and the maps are under all - to - all interaction as in the gcml . but instead of the uniform interaction in gcml , the interaction in egcml obeys an inverse power law with respect to the distance between the maps on the lattice .",
    "egcml locates at an intermediate position between the nearest neighbor coupling map model and the gcml with uniform interaction .",
    "thus egcml facilitates a test whether the salient feature of gcml is due to the scale invariant interaction in it .",
    "we find that egcml indeed inherits the intriguing properties of gcml though they turn out diffuse to some extent .",
    "for instance , in the two - cluster phase of egcml , the two clusters follow the same bifurcation tree with that of gcml when the population unbalance between the clusters are increased but the synchronization of maps in each cluster is looser in egcml than in gcml .",
    "we also observe in the turbulent regime of the egcml the same periodic window as well as the quasi - periodic clusters with high mixing rate .",
    "gcml exhibits the basic posi - nega switch as well as more intricate controlled switches among coded clusters at various hierarchical levels in its simplest construction@xcite and certainly serves as a model for intelligence activity .",
    "but the very fact that it is a system of globally coupled maps with an equal coupling makes it lose the notion of the distance between maps . in a way it is a zero dimensional chaotic field theory .",
    "apart from the intelligence one is interested to know what is the ( classical ) field theory of chaotic maps on the lattice at criticality . in this aspect",
    "the synchronizing maps on the lattice may be regarded as the analog of higgs condensation in the field theory@xcite .",
    "we can use egcml to see the general trend how the spatial clustering of maps occurs under the scale invariant interaction on the lattice .",
    "we find that egcml does exhibit a self - organized formation of the spatial clusters ( condensation ) due to the synchronization between the maps during the chaotic transient process in the switch and after it . in the egcml",
    "switch the positive ( negative ) cluster becomes negative ( positive ) evolving in the same two - cluster attractor as before with only a few percent change of the population unbalance between the two clusters in most of the runs .",
    "however , there occurs the mixing of maps between the clusters .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we pay attention to two important rules in the gcml .",
    "these are the reciprocity of the couplings among the maps and an invariance rule that the maps do not change their mean field under the interaction .",
    "we then construct egcml based on these rules . in sec .",
    "iii we compare the phase diagrams of both models and show that they are almost the same each other . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze the two - cluster regime of both models . for the gcml",
    "we clarify how the basic posi - nega switch between two clusters in the two - cluster regime can be realized .",
    "we then turn to egcml and investigate the switch process in it .",
    "we show that amazing spatial clusters are formed during the chaotic transient process in the switch . in sec .",
    "v we present the results of an extensive statistical analysis over the whole turbulent regime of both gcml and egcml .",
    "we show that even in the turbulent regime the maps are under coherence with various manifestations of periodicity effect .",
    "we conclude in sec . vi .",
    "the coupled map lattice model in general is a system of one - dimensional field on a lattice @xmath1 with number of sites @xmath2 which evolves simultaneously by an iteration of the following two steps : @xmath3 in the first step all @xmath4 on the lattice ( called as map   conventionally ) are simultaneously mapped by a nonlinear function @xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath5 could be different site by site but we consider here the simplest case that @xmath5 is a simple logistic map @xmath6 common to all sites . in the second step the maps undergo interaction between themselves . the @xmath7 constant matrix @xmath8 represents the coupling between the maps at @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the lattice and the parameter @xmath11 is an overall coupling constant . thus the model in the simplest form has only two parameters , the nonlinear parameter @xmath12 and the coupling constant @xmath11 .",
    "if we rewrite ( [ generic ] ) in terms of @xmath13 , we obtain @xmath14 which is a familiar form in the neural network analysis @xcite .      in gcml @xcite",
    "we consider n maps @xmath15 which evolve as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mean field on the lattice @xmath18 thus the coupling matrix of gcml is simply @xmath19 and clearly satisfies the reciprocity @xmath20 from ( [ global1 ] ) and ( [ global2 ] ) we can also derive a relation @xmath21 this relation guarantees that the mean field value is kept invariant when the maps undergo the interaction at the second step of the interaction .",
    "these two relations serve as a guide to construct the map lattice models in general .",
    "let us examine the implication of the invariance rule ( ii ) .",
    "the nonlinearity of @xmath5 generally magnifies the variance among the maps .",
    "therefore , the first step may be regarded as a _ defocusing lens _ with some _ random prisms _ installed in it . the larger the parameter @xmath12 is , the more strongly the defocusing lens acts on the system of maps . in the second step",
    "every @xmath22 is pulled to the mean field @xmath17 at a fixed rate @xmath23 .",
    "thus the second step acts as a _ focusing lens_. the larger the coupling @xmath11 is the more strongly the focusing lens acts . since ( [ global1 ] ) is a conformal contraction transformation the position of the _ center of mass _ @xmath17 of the system",
    "is kept invariant during the interaction .",
    "this is what the invariance condition ( ii ) implies .",
    "thanks to the invariance condition the fluctuation of the mean field of the maps is caused only at the first defocusing process .",
    "the maps in gcml evolve in time repeating this two - step process of defocusing and focusing . under the battle of the two conflicting tendencies the maps eventually form an attractor",
    "in which fluctuations among maps is maximally suppressed by the averaging effect of the interaction via the mean field .",
    "what is the condition on the coupling matrix @xmath24 for a general map model of the form ( [ generic ] ) satisfies the invariance condition ( ii ) ? by summing up ( [ generic ] ) over @xmath25 and using ( ii ) we obtain a relation @xmath26 at any step of the iteration this must hold .",
    "thus the necessary and sufficient condition on the coupling @xmath24 is @xmath27 from reciprocity ( i ) this is equivalent to @xmath28      this type of a model is known to show an interesting spatial cluster formation similar to the spin glass@xcite .",
    "on the other hand it is also known that the interesting two features of the gcml , i.e. the posi - nega switch and hidden coherence are lost .",
    "nonetheless it is instructive to check that this model satisfies ( i ) and ( ii ) like gcml .",
    "let us denote the sub - lattice of @xmath1 as @xmath29 which is a set of the nearest neighbor sites to @xmath25 including @xmath25 itself .",
    "the model is @xmath30 where @xmath17 is the mean field of the maps in @xmath29 at @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath31 the coupling matrix is then @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of maps in the sub - lattice @xmath34 in dimension @xmath35 .",
    "but if @xmath36 , then @xmath37 .",
    "hence @xmath38 and the condition ( i ) follows .",
    "also we have @xmath39 and ( ii ) follows .",
    "note that the interaction represents a diffusion process .",
    "for instance in @xmath40 we can rewrite ( [ ising1 ] ) and ( [ ising2 ] ) as @xmath41 and the second term is nothing but the laplacian on the one - dimensional lattice .",
    "we now wish to construct the following model .",
    "firstly it must have all to all interaction and satisfy the relations ( i ) and ( ii ) in order to have the same defocusing and focusing dynamics as in the gcml . secondly we wish to investigate the consequence of distance dependent interaction ; in particular , we wish to know to what extent the salient features of the gcml such as the posi - nega switch or the hidden coherence depend on the fact that the model is scale invariant trivially by the absence of distance scale .",
    "do these features disappear if the interaction between the maps decreases with distance ? certainly at the nearest interaction limit , we know neither the posi - nega switch nor the violation of the law of large numbers occurs .",
    "most crucial case is the interaction which decreases with distance but in a power law .",
    "in contrast to the exponential law this does not introduce the length scale and yet the interaction is all to all . thus the model we would like to construct",
    "is an extended gcml ( egcml ) in which the interaction decays with a power law and satisfies the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "below we show there is such a natural extension of gcml . in this article",
    "we choose @xmath42 for simplicity though our construction goes through for all dimensions .",
    "let us denote the set of sites at distance @xmath43 from @xmath25 as @xmath44 .",
    "the symbol @xmath45 is the memento of @xmath46 since in @xmath42 such a set is a loop ( in fact a square on the lattice space ) of radius @xmath43 around @xmath25 .",
    "we denote by @xmath47 the number of sites in @xmath48 . for @xmath42 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we denote the maximal radius of the loop realized in the lattice @xmath1 as @xmath51 .",
    "this is the perimeter of the lattice and for @xmath42 , @xmath52 $ ] . to be precise we present our result for @xmath53 odd but",
    "we have checked no change of results occurs for @xmath53 even . in order to treat all of the sites in @xmath1 democratically and to minimize the finite size effect we impose the periodic boundary conditions . for any point @xmath25 on the lattice",
    "we calculate the effect of all maps within @xmath51 taking into account the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the egcml is then compactly described as @xmath54 where @xmath55 at @xmath25 is given by @xmath56 in words the effect of all the maps on the lattice to the map at @xmath25 is determined by a double average .",
    "firstly any one of the maps at an equal distance @xmath43 from @xmath25 must affect the map at @xmath25 with the same weight .",
    "thus they are averaged with an equal weight and this gives @xmath57 .",
    "then , the effects of maps with various distances from @xmath25 must be accounted for . in the egcml",
    "this is done again by taking an equal weight average of @xmath57 over @xmath43 from zero to @xmath51 which gives @xmath55 as a natural non - local extension of the diffusion process .",
    "the first average must be an equal weight average to respect the rotational symmetry . the second average must be again an equal weight average .",
    "it is necessary for the invariance condition ( ii ) as we show below .",
    "the coupling matrix element @xmath24 is the weight factor for the @xmath58 to contribute to @xmath59 via the double average and is given by @xmath60 thus in egcml any map @xmath58 at equal distance @xmath43 from @xmath25 contributes with an equal weight to the mean field @xmath55 and the interaction decreases with an inverse power with respect to @xmath43 for @xmath42 .",
    "the reciprocity ( i ) follows just as in the nearest neighbor case since @xmath61 is equivalent to @xmath62 .",
    "also the invariance condition ( ii ) can be proved as : @xmath63",
    "the gcml phase diagram in the @xmath64 plane given in @xcite is reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a to facilitate the comparison with the egcml phase diagram .",
    "for gcml we analyzed statistically the cluster composition of @xmath65 maps in the final attractor from 1000 random initial configurations and we verified the original phase diagram .",
    "the various phases are the outcome of the battle between chaotic motions of maps ( the defocusing effect ) and the interaction via the mean field forcing the maps to move coherently ( the focusing lens effect ) .",
    "since the gcml phase structure is elucidated in ref.@xcite we recapitulate here only the essential features necessarily in the following discussion .",
    "let us consider a line at @xmath66 for definiteness which is well - beyond the critical value @xmath67 of a single logistic map to the chaos@xcite .",
    "for a sufficiently large @xmath11 ( @xmath68 the maps in the final attractor are strongly bunched together in a cluster and evolve as a unity in the same chaotic motion as that of one single logistic map .",
    "this is the coherent phase . for @xmath11 in the range",
    "@xmath69 $ ] the interaction via the mean field can no longer exerts strong bunching and the final maps divide into two clusters .",
    "the maps in each cluster are still tightly synchronizing each other , while the two clusters mutually oscillate opposite in phase .",
    "this is as a solution of a minimum fluctuation in the mean field .",
    "we discuss this ordered two - cluster phase extensively in sec .",
    "iv .    for smaller @xmath11 , the number of final clusters increases but the number of clusters at a given @xmath11 does not depend on the number of maps @xmath2 .",
    "the typical number of clusters at various @xmath11 ranges is indicated in the phase diagram . for further smaller @xmath11 ( @xmath70 )",
    "the binding of the maps is almost resolved and the number of clusters is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "this region is the turbulent phase and we extensively analyze this regime in sec . v.",
    "final remark is that the boundary values of @xmath11 between phases simultaneously increase ( decrease ) in order to maintain the balance between the conflicting tendencies if the coupling @xmath12 is increased ( decreased ) .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b the corresponding phase diagram of the egcml .",
    "we used @xmath71 map lattice and analyzed statistically the final attractor configuration using typically 200 runs for each @xmath72 . for each map at the lattice site @xmath25",
    "must be individually calculated using the inverse power law . for @xmath73 egcml ,",
    "the necessary cpu time is about a hundred times of that for gcml of the same size .",
    "] there is a remarkable agreement between two phase diagrams except for slight shifts in the phase boundaries .",
    "for instance , for the egcml at @xmath74 , the coherent phase , the ordered two - cluster phase , and the turbulent regime are respectively realized at @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 to be compared with the boundaries quoted above .",
    "this agreement between two phase diagrams indicates strongly that egcml is in the same universality class@xcite with gcml .",
    "the ordered two - cluster phase of gcml is realized in a band in the @xmath79 parameter space with @xmath80 $ ] at @xmath81 and @xmath82 $ ] at @xmath83 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) . in this phase ,",
    "the maps divide into two clusters after some transient steps for most of the initial values .",
    "the clusters oscillate around the unstable fixed point @xmath84 mutually opposite in phase and the maps in each of the two clusters are in tight synchronization . in order to distinguish the two clusters we follow the convention in @xcite and",
    "name the cluster which takes a value above ( below ) @xmath84 at an even step @xmath85 from the first of the iteration as the positive ( negative ) cluster .",
    "we denote the number of maps in the positive ( negative ) cluster as @xmath86(@xmath87 ) and define the population ratio parameter @xmath88 .",
    "the values of maps in the positive ( negative ) cluster are uniformly @xmath89 if the synchronization of maps in each cluster is really tight .",
    "the maps are evolving in two clusters repeating the two step process of mapping and interaction and the dynamics of maps is reduced to that of two clusters : @xmath90 and the mean field of maps at time @xmath85 is given by @xmath91 where the second equality comes from the invariance condition ( ii ) for the two - cluster configuration .",
    "thus when a set of three numbers , @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath78 is given the attractor of the two clusters is uniquely determined . for",
    "the discussion of the posi - nega switch below let us explain these by an explicit sample in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the left box",
    "we illustrate the mechanism of eqs .",
    "( [ twocluster1 ] ) and ( [ twocluster2 ] ) and in the right box we show a sample attractor of two clusters realized at @xmath92 , @xmath93 and the corresponding motion of the mean field . the two clusters , represented by white and black circles , evolve in time under the iteration of mapping ( solid arrows ) and focusing by interaction ( dashed arrows ) . the mean field ( a short bar )",
    "is kept invariant under the interaction as dictated by the invariance condition ( ii ) and ( [ twocluster2 ] ) .",
    "the first time @xmath94 in this run happened to be even .",
    "hence the positive cluster is the white circle moving as @xmath95 and the negative one is the black circle moving as @xmath96 .",
    "we see that they move in period four and mutually opposite in phase . the mean field is closer to the negative cluster , which means that the positive cluster is the minority cluster and @xmath78 must be less than half .",
    "numerically @xmath97 for this attractor .",
    "note that it is probabilistic whether the first time @xmath94 is even or odd . from another initial configuration the same attractor _ modulo",
    "translation in time _ may be equally realized .",
    "if the translation is odd steps in time we will have the same figure but with @xmath94 is now odd . the dominant cluster ( black circle ) must be then named as the positive cluster and @xmath98 by definition .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a and b we show the attractors of gcml and egcml at @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively as a function of @xmath78 .",
    "we used @xmath99 runs for gcml and @xmath100 runs for egcml . in one run for gcml",
    ", @xmath65 maps are iterated from a random initial configuration and to account for the first transient process the values of maps during the @xmath101 steps after the first @xmath102 iteration are plotted at the fraction of maps with @xmath103 .",
    "for instance the run shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with @xmath94 even contributes four points @xmath104 at @xmath97 and other four points @xmath105 at @xmath98 .",
    "then the run is repeated and the results of all runs are superposed in order to see the dependence of the attractor on the population unbalance between the clusters .",
    "note that this is equivalent to plot the maps only at the last even iteration steps at @xmath78 when the results from many initial configurations are superposed .",
    "the gcml attractor in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a agrees with that found in ref.@xcite .",
    "when @xmath78 approaches an upper threshold @xmath106 from below ( or a lower threshold @xmath107 from above ) the attractor undergoes successive period doubling and at the thresholds the maps fall into chaos ( @xmath106=@xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath92 ) .    for egcml in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b the final attractor of @xmath110 maps is measured in a similar way but in order to shorten the large computing time necessary for egcml a routine is included in the iteration program which judges whether the maps have fallen into a periodic attractor of a certain period @xmath111 less than or equal to @xmath112 or not is calculated at every even step @xmath85 and when it stops to vary during ten successive steps the routine is activated at @xmath94 .",
    "it calculates the judgment condition @xmath113 and if this is satisfied for some @xmath114 the maps are judged to have fallen into an attractor of a period @xmath111 . if not , the routine is inactivated and the next stabilization of @xmath86 is waited for . ] . if the judgment condition is satisfied the maps are plotted at the fraction of maps with @xmath115 only during the next one cycle of the attractor and the next run is started .",
    "this not only shortens the calculation time but also enables the statistical analysis of the frequency of the occurrence of the attractors and of the fluctuation of maps in a given attractor since indefinitely duplicated plotting of the maps is avoided .",
    "if on the other hand the maps do not fall into an attractor all through the @xmath102 steps the maps are plotted for the next @xmath101 steps just as in the gcml run . in egcml",
    "we find that the maps in a cluster synchronize more loosely than those in gcml .",
    "the dispersion of maps in each cluster is approximately 0.1 for all @xmath78 to be compared with the gap size @xmath116 between the two bands of the attractor at @xmath117 .",
    "even though the maps do not mix between the clusters in the final stable attractor this fluctuation hides the details of bifurcation structure with respect to @xmath78 in a direct superposition of all runs in terms of the bitmap graphics .",
    "thus we have done a statistical analysis of the plot density and removed those points with density less than one percent of the maximum density from the diagram .",
    "this procedure is justified because we truncated each run just after one cycle of the periodic attractor so that each run contributes to the points on the attractor diagram with an equal weight .",
    "it was a remarkable instance in this work when we observed the same bifurcation diagram with gcml turned out in the central region of the egcml attractor ( @xmath118 $ ] ) as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b . in egcml",
    "the synchronization of maps in a cluster becomes looser than that of gcml but still the dynamics of final clusters is common for both gcml and egcml and controlled by @xmath78 .",
    "we have already seen above that egcml is endowed with a phase diagram remarkably similar to that of gcml and now we find that the attractors in both models in the ordered two - cluster regime are also similar .",
    "the posi - nega switch in gcml uses the ability of @xmath78 to control the attractor .",
    "but before delving into the detail discussion of the posi - nega switch let us examine to what extent the reduction of dynamics of maps is realized .",
    "if the reduction is really effective down to two degrees of freedom , all @xmath86(@xmath87 ) maps in the positive ( negative ) cluster should have a single value @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) . then eqs .",
    "( [ global1 ] ) and ( [ global2 ] ) should reduce to ( [ twocluster1 ] ) and ( [ twocluster2 ] ) or equivalently to a matrix coupled two - map model @xmath121 with @xmath122 and @xmath123 . from the remarkable agreement between gcml attractor ( fig .  [ fig3]a ) and two - map model attractor ( fig .  [ fig3]c )",
    "we see that in the two - cluster phase of gcml the dynamics of the @xmath2 maps reduces to that of two maps for all @xmath78 between the thresholds .    in egcml",
    "the coupling @xmath24 is not a single constant but it depends on the distance between @xmath25and @xmath124 .",
    "the interaction acts on a map at a site @xmath25 via the position dependent mean field",
    "@xmath55 which is a double sum given by ( [ tsm2 ] ) and ( [ tsm3 ] ) contrary to a single sum @xmath17 given by ( [ global2 ] ) in gcml",
    ". therefore the reduction of egcml to two maps we find in fig .",
    "3b requires an explanation .",
    "what is important here is not the uniformness of the couplings but the scale invariance of them . in both gcml and",
    "egcml the interaction has no cutoff scale and hence it prevails over the lattice and the maps are forced to synchronize among themselves due to the averaging effect of the interaction via the mean field .",
    "thus the possible difference of egcml from gcml comes solely from the variation of the site dependent @xmath125 around @xmath17 .",
    "if the variation is small both models will show similar attractors .",
    "egcml is constructed in such a way to assure this small variance when the interaction forces the maps to synchronize .",
    "first let us consider a simple case where the nonlinear parameter @xmath12 is so small that the chaotic randomness in each map can not overcome the averaging effect .",
    "then after iterations all the maps on the lattice will synchronize and take approximately the same values with only a small variance .",
    "if we ignore this variance , the value @xmath22 common to all @xmath25 becomes a multiplicative factor to the sum for the mean field and @xmath126 follows from the invariance conditions ( [ unitaritygcml1 ] ) for gcml and ( [ unitarityegcml ] ) for egcml . in gcml",
    "the variance is negligible but in egcml the weaker synchronization causes a variance typically to the order @xmath127 in @xmath125 and the egcml attractor turns out reflecting this variance . but otherwise egcml behaves just like gcml .    now in the two - cluster phase at higher @xmath12 the maps can not be bunched together in a single cluster and divide into two clusters , a and b. the maps in each of the clusters take approximately the same value and synchronize among themselves .",
    "hence we may write @xmath128 here @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) is the collective coordinate for a ( b ) ( the average of maps taken over a ( b ) only ) and the @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) represents small fluctuation around the @xmath133 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "now let us analyze @xmath125 for egcml .",
    "an important observation is that the double sum for @xmath125 can be written as a sum of two double sums , one only over cluster a and the other only over cluster b. this decomposition allows one to apply the above argument to each of the clusters and the @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) becomes a multiplicative factor to the double sum for cluster @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) . as for the remaining double sum of couplings ,",
    "some more consideration is necessary . in egcml",
    "a ` polarized ' distribution of maps is in principle allowed in which , for instance , the maps in the cluster @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) accumulate around a given point @xmath25 and maps in cluster @xmath137 ( @xmath136 ) accumulate far from @xmath25 .",
    "but egcml has no interaction to induce such a polarization and the randomness in each map also acts to break the polarization .",
    "we have numerically checked the dominance of unpolarized distributions .",
    "therefore the remaining double sum for egcml again counts the number of maps in each cluster just in the same way the single sum for gcml does in ( [ twocluster2 ] ) .",
    "thus we have also in egcml @xmath138 here the approximation takes into account both the polarization in fluctuation and the small variance of maps in each cluster due to approximate synchronization . thus the collective coordinates @xmath133 and @xmath130 of the clusters is described by the matrix coupled two - map model and the maps in each of the clusters fluctuate around the collective coordinates .",
    "this explains the approximate reduction of egcml to two maps .",
    "the posi - nega switch found in gcml@xcite is based on the ability of @xmath78 as the control parameter of the gclm attractor . if maps are successively transported from one cluster to the other by input ( @xmath139 ) the population unbalance can be enhanced and the attractors undergo successive bifurcation .",
    "when @xmath78 reaches the threshold the whole maps go into a grand chaotic motion almost bunched together in a unit .",

    "[ fig3]a that there is no self - organized stable attractor above @xmath106 ( or below @xmath140 ) .",
    "thus after some transient time the maps again form the allowed stable configuration , that is , tightly bound two clusters mutually oscillating opposite in phase .",
    "just as before let us again label the new cluster as positive if it takes a value above @xmath84 at even step @xmath85 ( counting from the start of iteration ) and the other as negative .",
    "an amazing finding in @xcite is that the composition of the new two clusters is limited only in two ways .",
    "( 1 ) all the maps involved in the positive cluster before the chaotic transient are now involved in the negative cluster .",
    "( 2 ) all the maps in the old positive cluster are again in the new positive cluster .",

    "what is the mechanism that protects the maps from mixing ?    before answering this old puzzle let us point out some trivial aspects of the posi - nega switch .",
    "first there is no essential difference between case ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "how long the chaotic transient process persists and in particular whether the duration time is even or odd is ( almost ) probabilistic .",
    "it is of course deterministic but highly dependent on the map values at the onset of the transient process . whether a cluster after the transition is positive or negative depend on the parity ( even or odd ) of the duration time by definition and there is no sense to distinguish ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) when the parity is indefinite .",
    "second we should note that in the two - cluster phase of gcml with fixed @xmath12 and @xmath11 the self - organized attractor is determined solely by the population unbalance between the two clusters . in case",
    "( 1 ) @xmath141 and in case ( 2 ) @xmath142 . in either case ,",
    "the population _ unbalance _ is the same before and after the transition and hence the attractor before and after must be the same . to be precise , to put the attractor before the transition upon that after the transition we need a temporal translation of odd steps in case ( 1 ) and even steps in case ( 2 ) .",
    "modulo this difference the attractor before and after the transition are the same in either case .",
    "there is no chance of appearance of a new attractor _ provided that _",
    "the population _ unbalance _ before and after the transition is the same .",
    "therefore the real puzzle boils down to a single question .",
    "what is the mechanism which keeps the population unbalance between two clusters unchanged before and after the chaotic transient process ?",
    "we solve this puzzle below in two steps .",
    "first we discuss how the chaotic transient process starts and ends .",
    "this provides the temporal boundary conditions of the transient process .",
    "then we show there is a very simple mechanism which transfers the population unbalance rate through the transient process .",
    "the logistic map @xmath143 copies the region @xmath144 $ ] onto itself twice - fold as follows the limits are @xmath145 and the unstable fix point is @xmath146 but the argument here is independent of the particular parametrization of the map .",

    "see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . below the threshold",
    "the two clusters are moving mutually opposite in phase around @xmath84 so that one must be in region iii and the other in region i or ii . when the unbalance is increased by sending the maps of the minority cluster to the majority cluster the mean field comes closer to the majority cluster and oscillates in phase with it .",
    "the interaction conformally contracts the maps to the mean field at every iteration step , and the minority cluster is pulled to the mean field more strongly at this highly unbalanced situation . in a few iterations",
    "after the unbalance exceeds the threshold by the last input , the non - dominant cluster crosses the boundary @xmath84 .",
    "this is the very time of the start of grand chaotic transient motion of maps . at the next step of iteration",
    "all maps must move into the same direction .",
    "the synchronization opposite in phase ceases and the maps start almost coherent evolution .",
    "the mean field evolves together in the middle of them .",
    "the focusing effect of the interaction now works only to bunch the maps close together around the mean field .",
    "the high nonlinearity of each map then becomes manifest and all maps move around the three regions bunched together in a pseudo - cluster with a slight variance around their mean field . in the typical sample run shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the mean field ( depicted by a short sold bar ) oscillates closely to the dominant cluster ( connected by the solid line ) for several steps . at time @xmath148 the minority cluster ( the dashed line ) is pulled down across the @xmath84 and at the next step both clusters are mapped upwards together",
    ". then the grand chaotic motion starts at @xmath149 .",
    "the pseudo - cluster is formed by the external input and is unstable . to bunch it stably",
    "the coupling must be larger ; it must have the value for the coherent region ( e.g. , @xmath150 for @xmath92 ) .",
    "the tiny variance between maps in the pseudo - cluster is soon magnified and the transient pseudo - cluster is broken to the self - organized stable two clusters again . in the following we use the fact that the maps starts and exits the transient process with small variance among them .",
    "let us define the relative coordinates @xmath151 with respect to the mean field @xmath152 since all of the maps are now close to the mean field we may expand @xmath153 as @xmath154 averaging this over @xmath155 using @xmath156 we obtain a relation @xmath157 but the interaction does not affect the mean field ( the condition ( ii ) ) .",
    "so we obtain @xmath158 therefore the evolution equation of the relative coordinates is given by @xmath159 we used ( [ averagerelation ] ) once more in order to derive the third line .",
    "the last line is crucial .",
    "the factor @xmath160 is common to all maps and in particular it acts with a common sign .",
    "thus at every step in the chaotic transient process the maps separated by the mean field never mix each other .",
    "this is the mechanism which keeps the population unbalance unchanged before and after the chaotic transient process .",
    "the sign of the factor at @xmath85 depends on the mean field value @xmath161 .",
    "hence case ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) may occur equally .",
    "we note that the invariance condition ( ii ) is used in proving the mechanism .",
    "this condition is really important to explore the model which shares the property of gcml .    in the above resolution we examined the case in which the maps are confined in a pseudo - cluster and their variance around the mean field",
    "is kept small due to synchronization .",
    "numerically we can trace the motion of the pseudo - cluster .",
    "almost always the maps moves in a pseudo - cluster around the mean field with squared variance less than @xmath162 .",
    "but sometimes it intermittently splits into two or more tight clusters around the mean field .",
    "this does not invalidate above resolution .",
    "the danger of the mixing of members between clusters occurs only when they come close each other .",
    "our mechanism gives a guarantee that no mixing occurs even in such emergence .      in fig .",

    "diagram the maps at the even ( odd ) iteration steps are plotted and connected by lines .",
    "a similar figure was given in the first report of the gcml switch@xcite but the evolution of maps only at the even iteration steps was presented . by such a diagram only it looks as though the attractor undergoes a transition to a new periodic attractor after the posi - nega switch . but as we noted above , the attractor before and after the switch is the same modulo temporal transport of odd steps .",
    "we can see clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a the attractor on the whole , the even and odd iteration steps together , is precisely the same before and after the chaotic transition .",
    "as indicated by the arrows the switch from positive to negative is trivially a change in the count ( even or odd ) of iteration steps .",
    "what is not trivial is that the memory of the composition of two clusters is kept during the posi - nega switch . in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b we present a posi - nega switch event of @xmath165 gcml at even iteration steps only as a three - dimensional landscape plot . the peaks ( valleys ) before the chaotic transient process become the valleys ( peaks ) which is the posi - nega switch . in the transient process the maps form a surface which is chaotically oscillating but at any instance the segment of the surface looks remarkably horizontal .",
    "this shows that in the transient process the maps are in quasi - coherent motion with only a tiny variance . in fig .",
    "[ fig6]c we show a _ print circuit pattern _ of the same switch event only at even iteration steps distinguishing the maps with respect to the mean field value . those maps with ( @xmath166 ) are shown with white squares and the others by black squares . just as we proved above",

    "it can be also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6]c that the transient process ceases when the last transferred map ( @xmath167 ) comes back to its home cluster .",
    "this is a typical way of the end of gcml switch .",
    "this completes our resolution of the posi - nega switch mechanism .",
    "the egcml has almost the same phase diagram with gcml as we showed in sec .",
    "iii and the attractor of egcml in the two - cluster phase has the same bifurcation tree structure with that of gcml .",
    "but as we showed in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b the attractor of egcml turns out with some variance .",
    "that is , the dynamics of clusters in egcml is reduced to that of matrix - coupled of two maps just as in gcml but the maps in each egcml cluster are in phase - synchronization rather than in tight synchronization in contrast to gcml .",
    "the all to all interaction with no cutoff scale in egcml is effective enough to maintain the reduction to two - cluster dynamics for any @xmath78 between @xmath168 $ ] .    in the numerical simulation of egcml",
    "we find that the two clusters of egcml undergo a switch process by inputs which is similar to that in gcml . a typical sample of the egcml switch is shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] .",
    "but let us first list the general differences of egcml switch from gcml switch below and add description particular to fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] afterwards .",
    "\\(1 ) _ slower reaction _",
    ": by an injection of a pulse we transfer a map in the minority cluster to the majority cluster . in gcml",
    "the reaction of the attractor to this input is quite rapid and the attractor shifts to the new movement only after a few steps of the iteration . on the other hand in egcml the attractor reacts to the input gradually in several iteration steps",
    "this has a simple reason .",
    "the synchronization of maps in an egcml cluster is looser .",
    "when a map is transferred there occurs a negotiation among maps in each cluster to reform the clusters and then the two clusters mutually move to the new attractor .",
    "this is similar to the two step phase - synchronization found in the globally coupled flows@xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) _ self - organized transition _  : in egcml the effect of one pulse depends on the unbalance between clusters at the time of injection .",
    "if the unbalance is not high just a slow reaction of the attractor described above occurs .",
    "if the unbalance is high the map transportation by an input is followed by a self - movement of another map between clusters in the same direction .",
    "this occurs after a few tens of steps for the egcml of the size @xmath169 . if the unbalance is close to the threshold determined by the above statistical analysis ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) the transportation of a single map triggers a cascade .",
    "the last injected pulse induces follower maps to move from a cluster to the other cluster in the same direction and in some 100 iteration steps the move grows up to a series of avalanches at various scales .",
    "the corresponding change of the spatial distribution of positive and negative clusters is similar to a percolation transition . under this process",
    "no more external input is given and the maps are themselves forming a metastable state .",
    "both the existence of a threshold and the formation of clusters at various scales suggest a remarkable similarity to the self - organized criticality , e.g. @xcite , but further investigation on a larger size lattice , in particular the measurement of the critical exponent , is required to verify the relation .",
    "\\(3 ) _ the mixing _  : in egcml the two - cluster attractor after the chaotic transient process is for most cases approximately the same with that before .",
    "the change of the population unbalance is only a few percent in most of the runs . but there occurs swapping of maps between clusters and the composition of the clusters in terms of maps is often different before and after the egcml switch .",
    "the posi - nega switch in gcml is realized by the fact that no mixing of maps across the mean field occur during the chaotic transient process . in egcml",
    "the mixing does occur since each map is under the influence of position - dependent @xmath55 .",
    "thus the egcml switch is a posi - nega switch as a cluster process but not as the map process . in view of the brain dynamics",
    "this difference may be immaterial since what is important is the activity of whole neurons rather than the identity of individual neurons .",
    "\\(4 ) _ self - organized spatial clusters in egcml _  : before the switch the maps in the positive cluster and those in the negative cluster are almost randomly distributed on the lattice .",
    "the transition to chaotic transient process goes like a percolation transition .",
    "when the self - organized mass movement starts , the positive maps form several large - size spatial clusters and so do the negative maps .",
    "since these spatial clusters are formed by the long - range interaction the formation of them is more remarkable in the lattice of larger size .",
    "the spatial clusters can be best traced in the chaotic process by distinguishing the maps by the mean field of whole maps . at short time scale",
    "often we observe a posi - nega switch of spatial patterns .",
    "but due to mixing the spatial clustering pattern changes at longer time scale .",
    "now we explain fig .",
    "[ fig7]a which is a typical egcml switch event sampled in @xmath170 lattice ( @xmath171 ) .    _",
    "preparation : _ the maps are iterated from random start and a few tens of pulses are injected during the first 1500 iteration steps until the two synchronizing clusters exhibit period 32 oscillation mutually opposite in phase .",
    "_ start of chaotic process : _ at @xmath172 we injected ten pulses simultaneously to randomly chosen maps on the lattice .",
    "this was necessary to show the whole process in one figure .",
    "had we injected the pulses one by one with say a hundred steps in between we had been able to see the accelerated cascade transition as described in ( 2 ) above .",
    "but still we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a that the process after @xmath173 is a self - organized cascading process .    _",
    "the posi - nega switch between clusters : _ at @xmath174 the transient process ceased and a periodic attractor of two clusters appeared .",
    "as indicated by arrows we see clearly that it is the same attractor as before .",
    "the change of the unbalance of population between the two clusters is less than one percent in this switch .    _",
    "the spatial clusters : _ the snap - shot patterns of the maps at the even iteration steps are shown in the boxes below the evolution plot . in the upper boxes we distinguish the maps with respect to the mean field while in the lower boxes we used the unstable fixed point @xmath84 . in either way we can see that spatial clusters are formed by the self - interaction of maps during the chaotic transient process . we see clearly that the maps undergo a posi - nega switch among themselves between snap - shots 4 - 7 in the upper boxes . on the other hand in the lower boxes the pattern becomes sometimes totally black and sometimes totally white .",
    "hence , we see that the distinction by the mean field is a better way to sense the spatial cluster formation on the lattice .",
    "a distinction by the mean field is sensitive to the fluctuation around the collective coordinate .",
    "the clustering pattern extracted by this method is the long - range fluctuation dynamics of maps on the lattice .",
    "this long - range interaction dynamics can be seen more remarkably on a larger lattice which allows the formation of the spatial pattern of longer wavelength . in fig .",
    "[ fig7]b we show the samples of amazing spatial patterns formed during the chaotic transient process in the run of @xmath175 lattice ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "the snap - shots were sequentially taken at every four iteration steps .",
    "we observe that a small seed of fluctuation tends to grow into a circular dense pattern by the chaotic diffusion process on the lattice in accord with the isotropic interaction in egcml .",
    "it is interesting to note the similarity of the patterns observed on the lattice to the galaxies in the universe and in particular the appearance of patterns like globular nebula .",
    "the egcml may be used as a toy model for the formation of density fluctuations in a nonlinear diffusion process , though further study is required to test this speculation .",
    "the turbulent regime is generically the region of small @xmath11 and known by the so - called hidden coherence phenomenon .",
    "generally it is understood that in this region maps evolve almost randomly at small lattice size @xmath2 and that there occurs the hidden coherence at large @xmath2 .",
    "but actually the turbulent regime has a subtler feature .",
    "we are going to show that it is a regime where the grand periodic or quasi - periodic motion of the whole maps is in action almost everywhere . but first let us quote briefly previous observations in the literature in three items .",
    "\\(i ) when gcml is iterated from a random configuration with a small coupling ( @xmath177 ) and a large nonlinear parameter ( @xmath178 ) it reaches a final state which is an ensemble of maps and tiny clusters , each moving chaotically due to high nonlinearity of the map .",
    "( we show below that they are under certain coherence almost everywhere in the turbulent regime even though each element looks in an independent random motion . )",
    "the number of elements increases proportionally to the number of whole maps in sharp contrast to the ordered regime where the dynamics of maps reduces to that of a few clusters@xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) it was found in the statistical analysis of the mean field fluctuations that there emerges certain coherence between elements for large lattice size @xmath2@xcite .",
    "( we show below some reservation is necessary to this statement . )",
    "let us denote the mean field of the @xmath2 maps on the lattice @xmath1 at time @xmath85 as @xmath179 if @xmath180 are really @xmath2 independent random variables with a common distribution , the mean square deviation ( msd ) of the fluctuation ( @xmath181 ) should decrease proportionally to @xmath182 by the law of large numbers ( lln ) and the distribution of the @xmath183 must be a gaussian for sufficiently large @xmath2 by the central limit theorem ( clt ) .",
    "however the time series analysis of the mean field fluctuation shows that there is a threshold @xmath184 in @xmath2 ( depending on both @xmath12 and @xmath11 ) above which msd ceases to shrink even though the distributions remains in a gaussian shape .",
    "even though the elements ( maps and tiny clusters ) look evolving independently each other the violation of lln must reflect some hidden coherence between the elements .",
    "in fact an introduction of a very small independent noise term in each map restores lln@xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) this violation of lln observed in the time averaged distribution of @xmath183 reflects that the probability distribution @xmath185 that a map takes a value @xmath186 explicitly depends on time .",
    "a noise intensity analysis of ensembles successfully proves lln@xcite .",
    "if lln should hold in the time average , @xmath185 would have to be the fixed point distribution of the frobenius - perron(fp ) evolution equation@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the fixed point distribution is unstable due to the periodic windows inherent to the chaotic logistic map@xcite .",
    "the coherence manifests itself in the mutual information@xcite . on the other hand",
    "the temporal correlation function similar to the edwards - anderson order parameter for the spin glass@xcite decays to zero exponentially .",
    "thus it may not be due to freezing between two elements@xcite .",
    "all these are important observations for the turbulent regime of gcml .",
    "but this is not the whole story .",
    "especially one should not simply conclude by the above list that the turbulent regime of gcml ( and also egcml ) is a regime with complete randomness at small @xmath2 and with the hidden coherence for larger @xmath2 .",
    "the msd and distributions previously reported @xcite are only for the limited regions of the turbulent regime where the mean field distributions looks semi - gaussian and the violation of lln for large @xmath2 is remarkable .",
    "but there do exist regions in the turbulent regime where the coherence is suppressed strongly and the msd obeys lln in a good approximation .",
    "oppositely there are also large regions where the final attractors are two or three clusters which evolve stably ( until the end of @xmath187 iterations ) in period three ; a grand periodicity in the turbulent regime .",
    "furthermore even in a large part of the hidden coherence   region the distribution is not really gaussian ; it is only semi - gaussian ( trapezoidal ) or has visible peaks on top of semi - gaussian distribution .",
    "we can detect the remains of the periodic coherent motion by an analysis of the decay of a temporal correlation function for these regions .",
    "the turbulent regime is actually the region which is full of periodicity remnants and the hidden coherence is realized in between the genuinely turbulent regions and manifestly periodic regions .",
    "the egcml shares the same features with gcml . in the following",
    "we show these facts by an extensive analysis over the whole turbulent regime .",
    "we measure the distribution of @xmath183 and its msd at every point on the grid on the @xmath188 plane in the turbulent regime at a fixed value of the nonlinear parameter @xmath12 . here",
    "we choose @xmath189 as a canonical value but our observations below generally hold for other values of @xmath12 larger than @xmath190 . at @xmath191",
    "the turbulent regime is from @xmath192 to @xmath193 for gcml and from @xmath192 to @xmath194 for egcml ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] a and b ) .",
    "thus we set a @xmath195 @xmath188 grid where the lattice size @xmath196 varies from @xmath197 to @xmath198 with an increment of @xmath199 two is necessary for two - dimensional egcml with the periodic boundary condition . for gcml",
    "we keep the increment the same for the sake of comparison . ] and the coupling @xmath11 varies from @xmath200 to @xmath194 with an increment @xmath201 . at every point on the @xmath188 grid with @xmath12 fixed at @xmath202 , the maps are iterated from a random start and the mean field @xmath183 is measured during the time interval between @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "thus the result for one run at @xmath191 is a @xmath195 table of distributions and each distribution is a histogram of @xmath205 @xmath183 .",
    "we have repeated the run several times for the same @xmath12 and verified that the general result is independent from the change of the initial configuration of randomly produced maps .",
    "we have also checked in two ways that our @xmath188 grid is sufficiently fine to see the general feature of the turbulent regime .",
    "firstly we randomly chose more than a hundred squares of the grid and subdivided them . using this finer grid",
    "we have verified that either the variation of @xmath11 or @xmath2 within each square does not cause any significant change of the distribution ( a local check ) .",
    "secondly the compiled @xmath206 distributions are sufficient to make an animated show of the distribution .",
    "we observed by this animation that the distribution changes systematically the shape with variation of either @xmath11 or @xmath2 over the whole @xmath188 grid though the onset of the apparent periodic distribution is quite rapid ( a global check ) .",
    "we find that a special care must be taken over for the transient time when we are on the edge of the periodic window region .",
    "there the maps may fall sometimes into the final periodic attractor after , for instance , @xmath207 iterations but sometimes only after @xmath208 iterations depending on the random initial values . for this edge region",

    "the global features of the msd surfaces may be summarized as follows . * the valleys *  : at the valleys of the surface the msd still approximately respects lln and we may call these valleys as genuinely turbulent regions .    apart from the valleys lln does not hold .",
    "this does not imply the real violation of the lln in the ensemble average@xcite .",
    "what is meant by the violation of lln here is that there is a larger fluctuation in the time series of @xmath183 than expected by lln .",

    "the rank distribution plot is almost a contour plot of the msd surface .",
    "this is highly non - trivial . that the rank plot is a contour plot of a surface means that there occurs no jump of ranks when we vary either @xmath11 or @xmath2 .",
    "for instance to go to rank four from rank zero one has to pass the intermediate rank regions .",
    "this indicates that the dynamics of maps changes continuously ( not necessarily smoothly ) when either @xmath11 or @xmath2 is varied over the turbulent regime .",
    "\\(2 ) the fist class peaks of the msd surface occur just at the rank three and four distributions .",
    "the first - class peaks are due to the periodic coherent motions of elements .",
    "\\(3 ) in the second - class peaks the mean field distribution is rank zero ( both clt and lln hold . ) for small @xmath2 . when @xmath2 is increased with @xmath11 fixed , it becomes rank one ( clt holds but lln violated ) above certain threshold . with a further increase of @xmath2",
    "it almost always become rank two ( even clt is not fully operative ) .",
    "no higher rank distribution ( rank three or four ) appears in the second - class peak regions . only in small band(s ) of @xmath11 ( for instance , only in a narrow band around @xmath217 for @xmath191 ) the rank remains one for large @xmath2 .",
    "\\(4 ) the threshold between rank zero and rank one distribution precisely agrees with the break point @xmath214 of the drop of msd following lln . for reference",
    "we superpose the approximate curve for the @xmath214 ( @xmath218 ) given by @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and indeed it runs roughly between the rank zero and rank one regions .",
    "we consider the fact in ( 3 ) that the rank one distribution changes smoothly to the rank two distribution with increasing @xmath2 is a key to the hidden coherence ; it indicates that the coherence between maps hidden   in the rank one distribution region becomes manifest in the adjacent rank two distribution region .",
    "hereafter we focus our attention to gcml . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we show a sample of ( 3 ) in the left three boxes .",

    "the @xmath183 distribution is hence rank zero and both lln and clt hold . at @xmath222",

    "now in the third box at @xmath225 the distribution turns out to be the rank two distorted gaussian distribution .",
    "even clt no longer holds . in the fourth box",
    "we also exhibit the @xmath183 distribution at @xmath226 , @xmath223 and @xmath65 .",
    "this is in our classification the rank three distribution with two overlapping gaussian peaks . in the model with @xmath191",
    ", we can move to this dynamics region by varying @xmath11 , i.e. by traversing the turbulent regime .",
    "this point is further substantiated in the following subsections .    at this point",
    "we need some explanation on the terminology of the _ hidden _ coherence .",
    "the interesting phenomenon that above some @xmath214 the lln in the time series is violated certainly occurs but now we have found that it is restricted to the second - class peak regions only .",
    "there are valleys where lln approximately holds even for large @xmath2 and also the first - class peak regions where lln is violated even for small @xmath2 . and now even in the second - class peak regions the place where the clt holds ( with lln violated ) is again restricted .",
    "for @xmath191 it is only a narrow band around @xmath217 and it moves to the larger @xmath11 for larger @xmath12 .",
    "thus if a distinction between the rank one and two distribution is made and the hidden coherence is defined strictly as the phenomenon that clt holds with no approximation ( i.e. excluding the rank two distribution ) but with broken lln , it can live only in a very restricted region among the second - class peak regions .",
    "we will further show below that a careful analysis of the decay exponent of the temporal correlator can also unveil the coherence among maps .",
    "but still we consider the first discovery@xcite of the onset of the violation of lln _ even in the region where the clt holds ( rank one ) _ is remarkable .",
    "our point in emphasizing the distinction between rank one and two distributions is that the recognition that the rank one dynamics region is adjacent in the @xmath188 space to the rank two dynamics region which in turn is adjacent to the rank three and so on enables us to track down the change of dynamics and thus leads us to a working hypothesis that the hidden coherence is the most modest manifestation of the coherent quasi - periodic motion of maps ubiquitous in the turbulent regime .",
    "now that we have identified the various regions in the turbulent regime with distinct manifestation of periodicity let us to proceed to clarify how the dynamics of maps in these regions are related each other . to collect necessary information it is best to traverse the turbulence regime at fixed @xmath227 and varying @xmath11 as a tuning parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] we present a sample record of such an expedition at @xmath228 .",

    "this correlator is displayed in the third column .",
    "we show it just as defined by ( [ correlator ] ) but for the measurement of the decay exponent we quote values obtained by the signed logarithm plot ( @xmath233log@xmath234 ) of @xmath235 . for smaller lattice analysis we also averaged over data with different initial configurations to improve the statistics but this did not cause any significant change for the exponent estimation .",
    "the last column shows the return maps of @xmath183 ( the set of points ( @xmath236 ) from the last @xmath99 steps .",
    "let us start at pure randomness @xmath192 .",
    "the map average distribution has many sharp peaks with fractal hierarchy structure reflecting the unstable fixed points of a single map in the chaotic region .",
    "the @xmath183 distribution obeys of course both lln and clt and naturally sharp gaussian ( rank zero ) for @xmath65 .",
    "the evolution plot shows a simple logistic pattern and the return map is a simple tiny cloud of points .",
    "the correlator is one at @xmath237 by definition and decays almost instantly .",
    "we can foresee that periodicity three window in the first - class peaks is waiting us ( @xmath238)$ ] but let us choose @xmath239 to see if any precursor of it emerges .",
    "we find that the @xmath183 distribution has become rank one .",
    "the map average distribution has lost some sub - peaks since any one of the maps is pulled by the mean field in fluctuation and it has become more difficult for it to stay at the unstable sub - fixed points for long time .",
    "the coherence is still invisible neither in the map evolution nor in the return map .",
    "but we find that remarkably the correlator now oscillates in period three and decays exponentially ( @xmath240 steps for @xmath241 decay ) .",
    "this period three damping oscillation of the correlator starts at @xmath242 except for the valleys and the decay exponent becomes smaller for larger @xmath11 .    at @xmath243",

    "we are now very close to the first - class peaks .",
    "the correlator survives longer period ( @xmath244 steps for @xmath241 decay ) in period three motion .",
    "but the return map does not sense this . from the evolution diagram",
    "we can immediately tell that this failure of the return map is due to mixing of the maps between the quasi - clusters at a high rate .",
    "this inadequacy of a return map should be noted .",
    "at @xmath245 we are on the edge of the first - class peak regions .",
    "now very careful analysis is necessary to account for the first transient behavior of the maps .",
    "the truncation of the first @xmath102 steps is not sufficient and we have to watch the evolution carefully until at least during @xmath204 steps .",
    "we show two typical samples at @xmath245 .    in the first sample at @xmath245 the maps remain in a few quasi - clusters with mixing until the end of the run .",
    "the unstable quasi - clusters oscillate in period three and the correlator decays to @xmath241 only after @xmath246 due to the smaller mixing than before .",
    "now we can see in the return map three clouds of points turn out .",
    "the map average distribution has only three prominent peaks and all other sub peaks are lost .",
    "the corresponding @xmath183 distribution is rank three with both a visible peak and a shoulder on top of a broad band .",
    "the high msd of the @xmath183 distribution comes from the large separations between the dominant unstable fixed points of the maps in interaction .",
    "this distribution is an example of overlapping gaussian distributions .",
    "for the perfect periodic motion of the tight clusters , sharp delta peaks would be observed in both map and @xmath183 distributions . due to the decay of the quasi - clusters caused by",
    "the mixing the sharp delta peaks become broad and turn into overlapping gaussian distributions .",
    "we frequently observed more prominent overlapping two or three gaussian peaks in the whole analysis of the turbulent regime using both @xmath12 and @xmath11 as tuning parameters .",
    "( see , for instance , the fourth box in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . ) in the second sample at @xmath245 the maps literally dropped into period three attractor of three clusters at @xmath247 .",
    "as the map evolution plot shows the map positions in each cluster exhibit some variance in evolution so that we would better describe the clusters as quasi - clusters .",
    "the broad band in this rank three @xmath183 distribution is an artifact of the transient motion before the maps fall into the final attractor .",
    "there is no mixing at all between the clusters .",
    "the @xmath183 distribution is a sharp single peak and the @xmath183 return map is confined in a very small range .",
    "this is due to the fact that the three clusters happen to be almost equally populated in this run so that the mean field fluctuation is minimized .",
    "at @xmath248 we are at the summit of the first - class peak . here",
    "the maps almost always drop into period three attractor of two clusters . by only two clusters in period",
    "three motion the mean field must also fluctuates in period three .",
    "thus the @xmath183 distribution has sharp three peaks and msd turns out high .",
    "the value of msd is solely determined by the dynamics of clusters and @xmath2 independent .",
    "also the return map is widely spread .",
    "while we traverse the summit of the first - class peaks till @xmath249 the attractor remains in period three .",
    "sometimes it bifurcates to period six .    in further expedition",
    "we depart from the first - class peaks and go down into the second class peak regions .",
    "everything then occurs in reverse way in this descent till @xmath250 .    from @xmath251",
    "we traverse the second - class peaks as well as the valleys . at the second - class peaks the correlator survives above @xmath241 until @xmath252 but with no apparent low periodicity . then above @xmath253",
    "the correlator starts again catching the precursor of the period two opposite phase motion in the two - cluster regime of the gcml .",
    "thus the indeterminacy of the period of quasi - clusters beyond second peak regions comes from the fact that the regions are just in between the period three window and two - cluster opposite - phase motion regions .",
    "after @xmath254 the correlator shows perfect period two motion and the decay is smoothly prolonged with increasing @xmath11 . at @xmath255",
    "it only decreases by a few percent even at @xmath256 .",
    "correspondingly , above @xmath254 the middle peak in the map average distribution starts approaching to the peak at higher @xmath186 and above @xmath257 the map average distribution splits into two ( no events in the middle gap region ) . still in the evolution plot we can see the maps are in loose clusters with mixing between each other .",
    "the high msd of the rank two and three distributions above @xmath254 is clearly induced by the widely spread dominant unstable fixed points of low periodicity .      we have done a similar analysis at various @xmath12 up to @xmath226 and verified that all above features at @xmath191 are unchanged . the various manifestation of the periodicity is summarized in table [ table1 ] for @xmath191 . only a minor difference for larger",
    "@xmath12 is that the regions of rank one distribution above the first rank msd peaks become larger shifted to larger @xmath11 and also the rank three distribution starts to appear there . since the rate of the mixing of maps between clusters is the key to the turbulent regime we have also measured the temporal correlator of the clustering pattern matrix similar to the anderson - edwards order parameter@xcite .",
    "it exhibits the same variation of the decay exponents with our correlator .",
    "we examine below how the dynamics in various regions are related each other .",
    "( 1 ) let us first compare the dynamics of the periodic regions with that at @xmath258 . at @xmath258 maps evolve almost independently with long visit at all of the unstable fixed points of the logistic map .",
    "thus the map average distribution has many peaks with fractal structure peaking . since the maps behave as almost independent random variables with the same probability distribution , naturally both lln and clt hold . at the periodic window in the first - class msd peak regions , on the other hand , the @xmath23 focusing effect tunes the maps to form tightly bound two or three clusters mutually oscillating in period three attractor and this leads to the rank four distribution with sharp delta peaks .",
    "the dynamics of clusters in the periodic attractor is solely determined by @xmath12 , @xmath11 and the effective couplings between the clusters determined by the population",
    "_ ratios _ among the clusters ) does exhibit the same period three attractor at the same value of @xmath11 . ] .",
    "the msd of the @xmath183 distribution is again determined by the @xmath12 , @xmath11 and the population _ ratios _ between the clusters , and there is no room for the explicit @xmath2 dependence .",
    "similar coherent dynamics is realized also in the ordered two - cluster regime beyond the turbulent regime ( @xmath259 for @xmath191 ) .",
    "the turbulent regime has a period three window in the center of it and the two - cluster regime beyond it .",
    "we discuss below how these affect other regions .",
    "\\(2 ) when @xmath11 deviates from the range necessary for the period three cluster dynamics ( or for the period two - cluster dynamics ) , the perfect synchronization of maps among each cluster is no longer realized .",
    "but what we observed in the last subsection is that even for some large deviation of @xmath11 the maps still move under certain coherence if @xmath2 is beyond the threshold @xmath214 .",
    "such coherent motion of maps can be best described by _",
    "unstable quasi - clusters _ the decay life of which is given by the inverse of the exponent of the correlator .",
    "the maps now divide into a few masses _ at any instance _ of the evolution . in a short time",
    "scale these masses oscillate mutually in the same periodicity as before as we observed in both the map evolution plot and the correlator .",
    "but the variance of map positions among each mass is not so small and the synchronization of maps in each mass is also not perfect .",
    "hence we call these masses as quasi - clusters . due to the fail of perfect synchronization , the quasi - clusters mix each other by the exchange of maps and soon they loose their identities .",
    "so the quasi - clusters are unstable and have short life time . but still at any instance of evolution there do exist quasi - clusters .",
    "the quasi - clusters defined at a certain time decay but in the evolution of maps new quasi - clusters are kept created .",
    "we may regard these quasi - clusters as _ remnants _ of the perfect periodic motion of maps .",
    "in fact when we approach the periodic regions the decay exponent of the correlator decreases smoothly , that is , the life time of the quasi - clusters increases smoothly , signaling the phase transition from turbulence to periodicity .    in pure turbulence",
    "the system is invariant under the exchange of maps , while in the system of maps divided into clusters this permutation symmetry is broken .",
    "simultaneously the system in pure turbulence is invariant under the temporal translation , while the system in periodic motion is only invariant under the temporal translation just for the period .",
    "the self - organized state of maps in periodic quasi - clusters emerges as the state of broken symmetry from pure turbulence by a weak self - coupling and it emerges only for large @xmath2 .",
    "this is interestingly reminiscent of the onset of ordered parameter at the spontaneous break down of the global symmetry in the field theory where an infinite number of dynamical degree of freedom is necessary in order to support the ordered vacuum .",
    "see , for instance , weinberg@xcite where the broken symmetry state of a chair is elucidated .",
    "it is important that the maps in the quasi - clusters approximately follow the previous cluster attractor in the life time of the quasi - clusters .",
    "this means that the @xmath183 distribution is controlled by the scale of the previous attractor approximately and again determined by the @xmath12 , @xmath11 and the population _ ratios _ and not by @xmath2 .",
    "thus there emerges a @xmath183 distribution whose msd does not decrease with @xmath2 and lln is violated . depending on the rate of mixing and the allowed population ratios at the @xmath11 , distributions of various ranks emerge .",
    "\\(3 ) if the deviation of @xmath11 from the necessary range for periodic cluster attractor is not large , the failure in the map synchronization is not also large .",
    "the quasi - clusters decay by low rate mixing of members so the correlator survives for long time exhibiting clearly the periodicity of the previous periodic cluster attractor .",
    "but the would - be delta - peaks of both the average map distribution and the @xmath183 distribution at no mixing now change into overlapping gaussian distributions with visible separation between the peaks .",
    "these changes of the correlator and the @xmath183 distribution at small deviation of @xmath11 are precisely what we observe around the first - class msd peaks and near the upper boundary of the turbulent regime adjacent to the ordered two - cluster phase .    with further deviation of @xmath11",
    "the mixing rate becomes higher .",
    "the correlator decays more quickly and the @xmath183 distribution becomes from rank three to rank two - the distorted gaussian distribution .",
    "we observe this when we go down from the first - class peaks to the region of @xmath258 or when we approach the first - class peak regions from above . in the former case",
    "the correlator keeps exhibiting the period three damped oscillation even if we go down into the rank one @xmath183 distribution region . in the latter case the periodicity of",
    "the correlator becomes indefinite below @xmath254 for @xmath191 since naturally we are coming down from two - cluster regime with period two to the period three window , and we finally loose the track of a periodicity remnant ( rank two distribution ) when we go further into the narrow band of rank one @xmath183 distribution region .",
    "this is the genuine hidden coherence region .",
    "\\(4 ) the place the hidden coherence can live has now become very limited since we have improved the sensitivity to the coherence effect . in the old analysis@xcite ,",
    "the distinction between rank one and two distributions was ignored and neither the change of the decay exponent of the correlator with @xmath11 nor the periodicity of it was analyzed .",
    "the periodic window and the valleys were not discussed also .",
    "then the coherence seemed to live hidden everywhere in the turbulent regime if @xmath260 .",
    "now , both the periodic window with manifest coherence and the valleys with valid lln should be excluded first of all .",
    "furthermore , in the regions where the correlator has clearly caught the periodicity remnant , it is no longer legitimate to describe the coherence as hidden .",
    "thus , regarding the correlator the coherence is hidden only in a limited region in between the period - three and period - two remnant regions among the second - class msd peak regions .",
    "this is the region with @xmath251 for @xmath191 .",
    "see table [ table1 ] and eq .",
    "( [ second ] ) . here",
    "the correlator does show longer decay time ( @xmath241 decay within @xmath261 steps ) than that at @xmath258 but it decays with large fluctuation showing no low periodicity .",
    "this is natural for the region in between two different periodicity regions .",
    "but not only the correlator but also the shape of the @xmath183 distribution is a vital quantity to keep track of the change the dynamics . almost everywhere in the possible residence of the hidden coherence regarding the correlator , the @xmath183 distribution is rank two ( rather than gaussian ) and",
    "naturally understood as the smooth continuation of the rank three overlapping gaussian distribution .",
    "the clt is apparently violated here and the distribution is still controlled by the scale of the attractor .",
    "therefore , the place where the coherence is literally hidden from both the correlator and distribution analyses is now very limited .",
    "it is the narrow band at @xmath262 for @xmath191 and around @xmath263 for @xmath226 where the @xmath183 distribution is really gaussian with enhanced msd ( rank one ) and the correlator does not show the low periodicity . here",
    "the coherence seen in the enhanced msd can be only substantiated either by the finite mutual information or by the instability of the fp fixed point distribution .",
    "but in ( 3 ) above we successfully tracked down the smooth change of distribution ( and the corresponding change of the decay exponent of the correlator ) with the deviation of @xmath11 from rank four down to rank two distribution regions which surround the literally hidden coherence region .",
    "this gives a new way to look at the hidden coherence .",
    "higher rate mixing with further smooth deviation of @xmath11 should necessarily weaken the coherence among the maps and change the distorted gaussian ( rank two ) to the gaussian distribution .",
    "if the scale of the attractor still remains to govern the map dynamics the @xmath183 distribution with @xmath2-independent msd would emerges .",
    "we propose this last statement as a working hypothesis for the origin of the hidden coherence .      up to this point",
    "we have heavily depended on the numerical simulation .",
    "our concern is the statistical properties of the large - size gcml ( egcml ) and the monte - carlo simulation is naturally the basic approach to the phenomenology of such system . we have shown that a faithful extensive analysis of the data unveils amazing new features of the system .",
    "but , of course , if by some analytical method , one could relate the systematic manifestation of periodicity in the turbulent regime to the periodic behavior of the element of the system , namely the period three window of a single logistic map , it would be certainly a step forward to the real understanding of the turbulent regime . in this last subsection",
    "we discuss such an analytic approach .",
    "let us consider a typical case where the n maps are divided into equally populated three clusters @xmath264 ( @xmath265 ) and the clusters move cyclically round the three fixed positions @xmath266 .",
    "in such a maximally symmetric and period three motion of gcml maps , @xmath267 , the meanfield of all maps at time @xmath85 becomes a time - independent constant which is nothing but an equal weight average @xmath268 of @xmath269 . to see this",
    "let us first rewrite the meanfield using the invariance rule ( [ sumrule ] ) as @xmath270 then for the configuration in case the last average can be calculated as @xmath271 where @xmath272 denotes the coordinate of the cluster @xmath273 at time n. therefore , if such a configuration is produced by the interaction between the maps via the meanfield , any one of gcml maps must be evolving by a common evolution equation @xmath274 we can cast the evolution equation ( [ consthevolution ] ) with a constant meanfield @xmath268 and @xmath275 to a simple logistic map @xmath276 with a reduced coupling constant @xmath277 by a linear scale transformation @xcite @xmath278 the reduction rate @xmath279 is given by @xmath280    the period three window of the logistic map ( [ yevolution ] ) starts at @xmath281 by the tangent bifurcation and after the sequential bifurcation it closes at @xmath282 by the crisis .",
    "therefore the reduction rate @xmath279 must be for @xmath191 in the range @xmath283 and at a given rate @xmath279 within this range , ( [ rconstarint ] ) gives a curve of constraint on the @xmath284 plane .",
    "there is another constraint from self - consistency .",
    "each of the maps @xmath285 is related to the gcml maps @xmath286 by the linear transformation ( [ lineartransformation ] ) and so is the average value @xmath287 of maps @xmath285 to @xmath268 : @xmath288 since @xmath287 is simply an equal weight average of the period three stable orbits of ( @xmath289 ) , it can be estimated solely by the property of the logistic map without any recourse to the gcml evolution equation .",
    "for instance at the tangent bifurcation point ( @xmath290 ) , we have @xmath291 and from matching of the coefficients we obtain @xmath292 .",
    "numerically we find that @xmath293 slightly below the threshold @xmath294 , drops sharply ( @xmath295 ) to @xmath296 at the threshold @xmath297 , and @xmath287 gradually changes around @xmath298 until the end of the window ( @xmath299 ) . by eliminating @xmath268 from ( [ rconstarint ] ) and ( [ yconstaraint ] ) we obtain @xmath300 the estimated @xmath11 for @xmath191 from ( [ epsilonestimates ] ) is @xmath301 the estimates a , b , c and d",
    "are evaluated respectively below the threshold , at the threshold , at the first bifurcation point at the middle , and at the upper edge of the period three window in the order of increasing @xmath277 .    before comparing with the simulation result",
    "we should note that a maximally symmetric configuration of equally populated three clusters in period three motion is assumed in deriving ( [ epsilonestimates ] ) .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath11 necessary for such a configuration should be deduced from the genuinely period three region , namely from the interval from b to c. we can predict that @xmath11 must be in the range ( 0.0365 , 0.0422 ) for the formation of such a maximally symmetric gcml configuration .",
    "for such a configuration the meanfield should not fluctuate in time and it will show up as a deep valley in the gcml msd surface . we have added two exterior estimates in ( [ estimates ] ) expecting that these extensions will cover the asymmetrically populated clusters in period three motion .",
    "now let us compare ( [ estimates ] ) with the range of the period three first - class peaks found in section v b , namely , @xmath302 and @xmath212 .",
    "firstly there is a remarkable agreement between the range of peaks and the range of estimates a to d in ( [ estimates ] ) .",
    "the whole period three window of a single logistic map shows up as the whole first - class peaks . a closer comparison with the observations in section v d gives further support for the link of the structure observed in the numerical simulation and the period three window of the logistic map .    * we noted that in the deep valley of the msd surface between the two first - class peaks the formation of three clusters in period three motion .",
    "the valley region @xmath303 remarkably matches the above estimated range ( 0.0365,0.0422 ) for the maximally symmetric configuration .",
    "* we noted that in the upper first - class peak ( @xmath212 ) the maps almost always form only two clusters in period three motion .",
    "it is natural that the larger @xmath11 reduces the number of clusters from three to two . as we noted the extremely high msd in the first - class peak",
    "is induced by the asymmetric population configuration ( @xmath304 ) .",
    "furthermore we have verified by simulation that the first - class peak regions shift to higher @xmath11 when @xmath12 is increased precisely in accord with the prediction by ( [ epsilonestimates ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the maps with high nonlinearity are driven into coherent synchronizing clusters with very small interaction parameter @xmath11 once it takes the tune up value .",
    "a lot of further effort has to be devoted to fully appreciate the implication .",
    "the analytic approach here is only a step forward to this direction .",
    "a survey of the overall relation of peak - valley structure of the msd surface to the hierarchical windows of a single logistic map as well as the dynamical variation of the population configuration is now underway .",
    "in this article we have revisited the gcml and first resolved the puzzle of the posi - nega switch realized the two - cluster phase .",
    "the puzzle was that the maps posses the memory of the cluster to which they subject even though they pass through a transient chaotic process where many channels are open .",
    "we have proved that maps never mix across the mean field of them in the transient process .",
    "we have then analyzed the turbulent regime of gcml .",
    "to date the so - called hidden coherence has been the main target of interest in this region . we have presented our new finding that there exists a remarkable period three attractor regions in this regime .",
    "the turbulent regime locates in - between the genuinely turbulent region around @xmath192 and two - cluster regime of period two attractor and has this period three attractor regions in the center of it .",
    "we have shown that the remnant of the periodic coherence can be found almost everywhere in the turbulent regime by the measurement of the temporal correlator of the fluctuation of maps around the mean field and by the extensive analysis of the @xmath183 distributions over the whole turbulent regime .",
    "the dynamics of the turbulent regime can be well described by the quasi - clusters with mixing of elements between each other .",
    "the hidden coherence may be regarded the most modest manifestation of this remnant periodicity . by an analytic approach",
    "we have shown that the prominent periodicity manifestation in the turbulent regime is caused by the period three window of a single logistic map .",
    "a new extended globally coupled map lattice(egcml ) is constructed in which the interaction between maps decreases proportionally to the distance .",
    "egcml at @xmath42 has the same phase diagram with that of gcml .",
    "the bifurcation tree structure of the attractor of egcml in the two - cluster regime is also the same with that of gcml .",
    "the maps in each egcml cluster are phase synchronizing rather than synchronizing .",
    "the posi - nega switch between the two clusters is realized also in egcml . in the chaotic transient process in egcml - switch ,",
    "formation of amazing spatial clusters of maps is observed .",
    "egcml may be viable for the simulation of chaotic diffusion process .",
    "we have also shown that the turbulence regime of egcml is also not immune from periodicity just like gcml turbulent regime . as a whole",
    "this work is an exploration of order in the chaos .",
    "the posi - nega switch in gcml is realized because there occurs no mixing in the chaotic transient process . in the chaotic transient process in a egcml - switch , interesting spatial clusters are formed . and the turbulent regime of both of gcml and egcml is dominated by the quasi - clusters of maps in periodic motion .",
    "it is a pleasure to note the author s debt of gratitude to k. kaneko .",
    "this work was started several years ago stimulated by the pioneering articles on gcml by him@xcite and the compact model gcml has been an unfailing source of interest since then .",
    "the author is thankful to fumio masuda who worked on this subject together with the author until the last one year of completion and the nice collaboration time with him is memorized .",
    "thanks also go to hidehiko shimada for many crucial suggestions , hayato fujigaki for his collaboration on the study of coupled flows done in parallel with this work , and kengo kikuchi for his unfailing effort on the analytic approach to gcml now underway .",
