    "currently there is an international `` community '' of the first generation laser interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors @xcite ( ligo in usa @xcite , virgo in italy @xcite , geo-600 in germany @xcite , tama-300 in japan @xcite and aciga in australia @xcite ) .",
    "the development of the second - generation gw detectors ( advanced ligo in usa @xcite , lcgt in japan @xcite ) is underway .",
    "the ultimate sensitivity of laser gw detectors is restricted by the standard quantum limit ( sql )  a specific sensitivity level where the measurement noise of the meter ( photon shot noise ) is equal to its back - action noise ( radiation pressure noise ) @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of gw detectors is also limited by classical displacements noises of various nature : seismic and gravity - gradient noise at low frequencies ( below @xmath4 hz ) , thermal noise in suspensions , bulk and coatings of the mirrors ( @xmath5 hz ) .    in 2004",
    "s. kawamura and y. chen put forward an idea of so called displacement - noise - free interferometer ( dfi ) which is free from displacement noise of the test masses as well as from optical laser noise @xcite .",
    "the most attractive feature of dfi is the ability to achieve sub - sql sensitivity ( no sql since radiation pressure noise is canceled ) not accompanied by the necessity to build complicated optical schemes for quantum - non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the possibility to separate gw signal from displacement noise of the test masses is based on the _ distributed _ character of interaction between gw and light wave unlike the localized influence of mirrors positions on the light wave , taking place only at the moments of reflection .",
    "the `` price '' for this separation is the decreased detector response to gws , especially at low frequencies where the so called long wave approximation is valid , that is when the distance @xmath1 separating test masses is much less than the gravitational wave length @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7 or @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the light travel time between test masses , @xmath10 is the speed of light and @xmath11 is the gw frequency ) .",
    "in particular , the analysis presented in @xcite for double mach - zehnder interferometer showed that in long wave approximation the shot - noise limited sensitivity to gws turns out to be limited by @xmath12-factor for 3d configurations and @xmath13-factor for 2d configurations . for signals centered at @xmath14 hz and for interferometers with size of @xmath15 km ( @xmath16  s )",
    ", dfi sensitivity of the ground - based detector is @xmath17 times worse than that of a conventional single round - trip laser detector .",
    "another approach to the displacement noise cancellation was presented in @xcite where a single detuned fabry - perot cavity pumped through both of its movable , partially transparent mirrors was analyzed .    in this paper",
    "we investigate model originated from a simple toy model @xcite of the gw detector .",
    "our model consists of two double pumped fabry - perot cavities positioned in line .",
    "each cavity is pumped through both partially transparent mirrors . by properly combining the signals of output ports of the cavity an experimenter",
    "can remove the information about the fluctuations of the mirrors displacements and laser noise from the data .",
    "the `` price '' for isolation of the gw signal from displacement noise in our case is the suppression of sensitivity by factor of @xmath12 ( resonance gain partially compensates it ) as compared with conventional interferometers  it is larger than limiting factor @xmath18 of the double mach - zehnder 2d configuration @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ simple ] we analyzed simplified round trip model ( without any fabry - perot cavities ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec_fp_cavity ] we derive the response signals of a single double pumped fabry - perot cavity to a gravitational wave of arbitrary frequency and introduce their proper linear combination which cancels the laser noise and the fluctuating displacements of one of the mirrors . in sec .",
    "[ sec_2fp_cavities ] we analyze configuration of two double - pumped fabry - perot cavities which allows to calcel displacement noise of all mirrors completely . finally in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we discuss the physical meaning of the obtained results and briefly outline the further prospects .",
    "for clear demonstration we start from analysis of the simplest toy model @xcite consisting of @xmath19 platforms @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 positioned in line as shown on fig .",
    "gw propagates perpendicularly to this line .",
    "we assume that lasers , detectors and mirrors are rigidly mounted on each platform which , in turn , can move as a free masses .",
    "we also assume that mean frequency @xmath23 of each laser is equal to others . in this section",
    "we do not take into account laser noise yet paying attention only on displacement noise and gw signal .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case when radiation emitted from the laser on some platform is registered ( after reflection ) by detector on the same platform  so called round trip configuration .",
    "actually detectors are homodyne detectors measuring the phase of incident wave .    strictly speaking , in order to describe detection of light wave we have to work in the reference frame of detector , i.e. in accelerated frame .",
    "however , in our model detector is mounted on the same platform as laser which radiation detector registers and we can work in inertial laboratory frame as it was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "moreover , in this case of round trip configuration we can use transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge considering gw action as effective modulation of refractive index @xmath24 by weak gw perturbation metric @xmath25 .",
    "it is worth noting that in the opposite case , when laser and detector are mounted on different platforms , we should use the local lorentz ( ll ) gauge  see details in @xcite .    .",
