    "resonant energy transfer due to dipole - dipole interaction plays a crucial role in many areas of physics , chemistry , material sciences and biology .",
    "prominent examples are the light harvesting units of plants and bacteria @xcite , aggregates consisting of organic dyes @xcite or molecular crystals @xcite . since the work of franck and teller @xcite the theoretical framework to treat such processes is based on frenkel s exciton concept @xcite",
    ". however , internal and external degrees of freedom , e.g. , internal vibrational modes of molecules and interactions with the surrounding solvent or proteins , have great influence on the properties of those systems and render a complete theoretical description challenging @xcite .",
    "hence , a prototypical system for a systematic study of the effect of dipole - dipole interaction should have ( i ) a simple structure , ( ii ) should not couple strongly to the environment and ( ii ) should be easy to manipulate , e.g. in terms of its interaction strength or geometrical arrangement .",
    "rydberg atoms in ultracold gases are promising candidates to meet these requirements : first of all , their internal structure can often be reduced to a few relevant energy levels .",
    "second , they posess long radiative lifetimes and their coupling to the environment via thermal collisions plays a minor role due to the low thermal velocities in ultracold gases .",
    "finally , their mutual interactions can be controlled precisely , since the transition dipole moment of two adjacent rydberg states increases quadratically with the principal quantum number .",
    "consequently , clear evidences for resonant energy transfer due to dipole - dipole interaction have been observed in ultracold (  frozen  ) rydberg gases @xcite .",
    "there have been also several proposals how to study energy transfer in regular arrangements of rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "these geometries could in principle be produced by using optical lattices , or microlens arrays .",
    "such one - dimensional chains have served as a fruitfull model to understand spectral and energy transfer properties of dipole - dipole interacting systems and to investigate the influence of disorder on their electronic transport properties .    in studies on energy transfer",
    "the atoms / molecules are usually considered to remain at their initial positions .",
    "however , similar to the van der waals interaction @xcite , the dipole - dipole interaction can lead to forces between rydberg atoms , accelerating the particles .",
    "this effect has to be taken into account because it can lead to ionizing collisions and subsequent plasma formation , as demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , the induced forces might also be used to control the motion of the atoms , as recently suggested @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will investigate the motion induced by the resonant dipole - dipole interaction that triggers the energy transfer processes between atoms in energetically close rydberg states , as observed in the studies on  frozen  rydberg gases .",
    "to this end , we will assume that the rydberg atoms are arranged in a linear array and focus on two distinct situations .",
    "first , we will consider a regular chain , in which all the rydberg atoms are prepared such that they initially have equal nearest neighbor distance and second , the situation when the rydberg atom at one of the ends of the chain has a smaller distance to its neighbor than the atoms in the rest of the chain .",
    "the latter situation is a simple example , where the regularity of the mutual interactions in the system is broken .",
    "such a system is often refered to as exhibiting  off - diagonal disorder  .",
    "in both cases we will assume , that the system is initially prepared in one of the electronic eigenstates that form the exciton band .",
    "experimentally , this could be realized by exciting atoms arranged in a microtrap array to a specific rydberg state and subsequently promoting this system into an excitonic eigenstate of the chain by microwave excitation , similar to the procedure used in refs .",
    "@xcite .    a fully quantum mechanical treatment of this problem for long chains ( i.e. , many atoms ) is computationally demanding .",
    "therefore , we will use a mixed quantum / classical surface hopping method , in which the nuclear motion is treated classically while the electronic dynamics is treated quantum mechanically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we give a brief description of the model system and the propagation scheme which we use .",
    "for the regular chain , we discuss analytical estimates for the initial forces as well as for the kinetic energy of the system and present numerical results in section [ regular ] .",
    "having analyzed the basic properties of the atomic motion in the regular case , we proceed in section [ disorder ] with the case of broken regularity , by placing two atoms at one end of the chain closer together . finally , section [ concl ] presents our conclusions .    throughout this work atomic units will be used , unless stated otherwise .",
    "we consider a chain of @xmath0 identical atoms with mass @xmath1 and denote the position of the @xmath2th atom by @xmath3 .",
    "the distance @xmath4 between the atoms is assumed to be large enough that an overlap of their nuclear and electronic wavefunctions can safely be neglected .",
    "since the focus of the present work is on resonant transitions between two energetically close rydberg states , an essential state picture will be used , where for every atom only two electronic states are considered .",
    "we denote the energetically lower lying ( rydberg ) state by @xmath5 and the upper one by @xmath6 and sometimes refer to the latter as the  excited state  or the  excitation  .",
    "the energies of these states are @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , and @xmath9 denotes the transition dipole between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . by @xmath10",
    "we denote a state in which atom @xmath2 is in state @xmath11 and all others are in state @xmath12 . without any interaction between the atoms",
    "the @xmath0 states defined in are degenerate eigenstates of the electronic system with energy @xmath13 which we choose to be the zero of energy and restrict our discussion to the space spanned by the states in the following .",
    "the electronic energy transfer between two atoms @xmath2 and @xmath14 at distance @xmath15 ( fig [ fig : theory](a ) ) is mediated by the dipole - dipole interaction @xmath16 where for the sake of simplicity we have ignored orientational effects . due to this resonant dipole - dipole interaction",
    "the states given by ( [ def : pi_n ] ) are no eigenstates of the electronic system anymore . moreover , as the coupling ( [ vdd ] ) depends explicitly on the positions of the atoms , their center of mass motion will also be affected by the dipole - dipole interaction , i.e. , a force will be exerted on the particles that is proportional to the gradient of @xmath17 with respect to the nuclear coordinates of the atoms .",
    "consequently , both subsystems ( electronic and center of mass ) are coupled by ( [ vdd ] ) so that the motion of the particles will depend on the electronic state of the system and vice versa .",
    "the total hamiltonian for a one dimensional chain of @xmath0 rydberg atoms is , thus , given by @xmath18 where the electronic hamiltonian , which depends on the nuclear coordinates , is @xmath19 and we set @xmath20 .",

    "the non - adiabatic couplings are generally nonzero . in this case",
    "we use a propagation scheme , in which an ensemble of trajectories is propagated , and each trajectory moves classically on a single adiabatic surface according to eq.([eq : motion ] ) except for the possibility of instantaneous switches among the adiabatic states @xmath45 due to the presence of the @xmath46 .",
    "the algorithm used in this work to correctly apportion trajectories among the states according to their quantum probabilities with the minimum required number of quantum transitions is tully s fewest switching algorithm @xcite . for initial conditions that lead to fast collisions of atoms ,",
    "the non - adiabatic couplings become significant , as they are proportitional to the velocities of the particles ( c.f .",
    ". [ class_qm_general ] ) .",
    "this is manifest in large deviations of single trajectories from the ensemble average .",
    "therefore , the mean trajectories for such initial conditions were determined up to the point @xmath47 , at which the fastest collision event in a single realization occured .",

    "this decrease of the magnitude is reasonable , since in the eigenstates the excitation is delocalized more or less over the whole chain .",
    "therefore , the excitation is shared among all atoms in the chain , i.e. , a particular atom carries only a fraction of approximately @xmath63 of the electronic excitation .",
    "the directions of the initial forces follow a simple scheme , that can be deduced using the symmetries of the system reflected in the nodal structure of the initial electronic wavefunction .",
    "generally , the motion of the particles will be symmetric arround the center of mass coordinate of the chain ( which is a constant of motion ) .",
    "in particular , for a chain with an odd number of atoms @xmath0 the central atom ( @xmath64 ) will always remain motionless , as the forces acting on it from both sides cancel each other at all times .",
    "futhermore , there is one configuration , where all forces are directed towards the center of the chain and one , in which the accelerations are directed away from it . according to ( [ f_chain ] ) this is the case , when the initial electronic wavefunction has no nodes at all ( i.e. , the state @xmath23 at the lower edge of the band ) and , when the sign of @xmath45 changes from site to site ( i.e. the state @xmath60 with the highest energy ) .",
    "generally , all forces reverse direction when changing the initial state from state @xmath43 to @xmath65 .",
    "a pair of atoms experiences an attractive force , if the wavefunction on the corresponding sites has equal sign and a repulsive force otherwise .",
    "the total acceleration of a particle due to its two neighbors is then determined by the relative magnitude of the wavefunction at neighboring sites ( c.f .",

    "[ fig:5mer ] shows the numerically calculated trajectories , for the system prepared in the five possible electronic eigenstates @xmath40 , where now the interactions between all atoms have been taken into account .",

    "the trajectories starting from the two energetically lowest eigenstates show relatively fast collisions eventually leading to ionization of the rydberg atoms , whereas for the two highest eigenstates no collisions occur , although for @xmath68 the trajectories of the three central atoms come close to each other . for @xmath69 eq.[f_chain ] predicts that no forces at all are present in the system , which seems to contradict the numerical result .",
    "however , the analytical estimate for the forces was derived under the assumption of nearest neighbor interactions only . in the general case of",
    "the  full  @xmath70 interaction , the excitonic band shows a marked asymmetry ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 ) and the phase of the eigenfunctions is shifted due to the additional interactions from more distant sites .",
