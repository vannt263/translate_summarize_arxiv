    "in recent years the @xmath1he trimer has been the center of several theoretical investigations ( see , for example , refs . @xcite and references therein ) . from all methods employed in these studies ,",
    "the faddeev equations method is perhaps the most attractive since it reduces the schrdinger equation for three particles into a system of integral or differential equations which can be used to study bound states and scattering processes in a rigorous way .",
    "the differential form of the faddeev equations has been proposed long ago by noyes and fiedeldey @xcite . since then",
    ", these equations have been used in bound states calculations in nuclear and coulomb systems @xcite  just to mention a few references . the derivation and discussion by merkuriev of the asymptotic boundary condition of the differential faddeev equations ( dfe ) @xcite , paved the way to use the dfe not only in bound - state calculations but in investigations of scattering processes as well . for atomic systems , however , some peculiarities of the inter - atomic interactions resulted in a limited use of dfe in both bound and scattering calculations",
    ".    one of the peculiarities is that the interaction among atoms often contains very strong repulsion at short distances which is difficult to handle numerically .",
    "in addition , it generates strong short range correlations implying that in atomic systems one should take into account many partial waves in order to achieve convergence .",
    "these problems can hardly be solved by using the computational power of modern computers and requires instead the development of appropriate numerical techniques .",
    "one such technique is the so - called tensor - trick proposed by the groningen group @xcite .",
    "application of the method in nuclear and coulomb systems showed that high accuracy calculations can be made using low computer power .",
    "another method is that of cartesian coordinates applied for the first time in three body faddeev calculations in @xcite .",
    "the latter method is suitable in describing the long - range behavior of weakly three - body bound states correctly .",
    "this feature is crucial in calculating excited states close to the two - body threshold .",
    "yet another proposed method of solving the three - body problem is that of ref .",
    "@xcite in which no explicit partial wave decomposition is required and only the total angular momentum of the system is used . within this total angular momentum representation method",
    "the faddeev operator has a very simple form that allows the construction of effective numerical schemes .    in the present work",
    "we have combined the aforementioned methods and , moreover , we propose a new approach to overcome the difficulties arising from the short range repulsion .",
    "we applied the overall procedure in bound state calculations of the he@xmath0 system using various potentials and compare our results with other results previously obtained by various groups .    in sec .",
    "ii we describe the equations to be solved and formulate the appropriate boundary conditions . in sec .",
    "iii the numerical method is presented .",
    "our results are given in sec .",
    "iv while our conclusion are summarized in sec . v. some technical details for the field practitioners are shifted in the appendix",
    "when considering a three - body system it is convenient to denote the two - body subsystems by @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 and introduce jacobi coordinates which in the configuration space are defined by @xmath5 the coordinates corresponding to other pairs can be obtained by cyclic permutations of the subscripts @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , their relation being @xmath9 where @xmath10 are coefficients which depend on the masses of the particles @xcite . for identical particles these coefficients",
    "are @xmath11 we assume that the hamiltonian of the system involves only two - body interactions @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian of three free particles and @xmath14 are the two - body potentials .",
    "+ the wave function @xmath15 of the system can be expressed in terms of the three faddeev components @xmath16 @xmath17 satisfying the faddeev equations @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the energy of the system . in what follows",
    "we shall restrict ourselves , without loss of generality , to three identical bosons which is the case under consideration .",
    "in such a case the faddeev components have the same functional form in their own coordinates and thus the system ( [ faddeqr6 ] ) is reduced to one equation only @xmath20 in this equation @xmath13 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the cyclic and anticyclic permutation operators respectively , @xmath23 is one of the faddeev components @xmath24 written in its own coordinates .",
    "the potential energy of the system is invariant with respect to rotations .",
    "this makes it possible to separate out the degrees of freedom corresponding to rotations of the system .",
    "this can be achieved by expanding the faddeev component @xmath23 in terms of eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum , _ i.e. _ wigner functions @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 here @xmath27 are the coordinates describing collective angular motion of the system and @xmath28 are the projections of the faddeev component in subspaces with fixed angular momentum .",
    "the components of the projections depend on the _ intrinsic coordinates _",
    "@xmath29 which describe the intrinsic state of the cluster .",
    "since we can fix the total angular momentum @xmath30 of the system , the corresponding projection of the free hamiltonian can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for a matrix constructed from the wigner functions @xcite . in the case of zero total angular momentum",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath33 reads @xmath34 the corresponding projection of eq .",
    "( [ faddeqmatrix ] ) takes the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are @xmath40 assuming that in each two - body subsystem only one bound state exists , we can write the asymptotic boundary conditions for the faddeev component @xmath41 as follows @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the wave function of the two - body bound state in the two - body subsystem , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the two  body bound state energy , and @xmath47 the energy of the three - body system .",
    "the first term corresponds to virtual decay into a particle and a two - body bound system , usually denoted as 2 + 1 , while the second term corresponds to a virtual decay with an amplitude @xmath48 into three single particles denoted as 1 + 1 + 1 .",
    "the term corresponding to the latter configuration decreases much faster than in the 2 + 1 .",
    "+ in the present work the term corresponding to 1 + 1 + 1 virtual decay is neglected and thus the asymptotic boundary conditions for the faddeev component at sufficiently large distances @xmath49 and @xmath50 read @xmath51",
    "the first numerical calculation with the dfe were made by laverne and gignoux in the early seventies @xcite . since then , many numerical methods were proposed . in the present work we shall employ : i ) quintique splines @xcite together with an orthogonal collocation @xcite procedure which allows us to construct a linear system of equations corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eqfaddtam1 ] ) . in this way",
    "the bound state problem can be transformed to a generalized eigenvalue problem .",

    "however , an additional regularization is usually needed to accelerate the convergence . for this",
    ", one may split the operator @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ discrfadd ] ) into two parts , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , is such that the operator @xmath63 can be explicitly constructed while @xmath64 can be considered as a remainder .",
    "the technique of explicit inversion of an operator @xmath65 is known as tensor - trick @xcite and is briefly described in appendix b for cartesian coordinates .",
    "+ following the standard procedure we write for the eigenvalue problem @xmath66 where for physical solutions we have @xmath67 . eq .",
    "( [ lambda1 ] ) can be solved using the arnoldi algorithm @xcite .",
    "+ although the above scheme can be applied effectively for a wide range of potentials , it is not satisfactory for interatomic potentials with a strong repulsive core .",
    "a typical example is the helium dimer potential which has a core with enormously strong repulsion and an extremely weak attractive well just enough to hold a two - body bound state . in what follows",
    "we give a brief analysis of the difficulties that arise and propose a recipe to overcome these difficulties .",
    "since to reproduce the correct long - range behavior of the faddeev components cartesian coordinates are used , the natural choice of the operator @xmath68 in ( [ lambda1 ] ) is @xmath69 in this case the problem of calculating bound states is reduced to calculation of the largest eigenvalues of the operator @xmath70 to demonstrate how the presence of a short - range repulsion manifests itself in the spectral properties of the operators @xmath71 , one must compare the spectra of potentials with and without a strong repulsive core .",
    "two such potentials are the interatomic he  he ttypt potential @xcite and the nucleon - nucleon ( mt - v ) potential @xcite the spectra of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "two main features of the spectrum of the ttypt potential should be pointed out , namely , that the spectrum contains numerous large negative eigenvalues and that for all values of the energy @xmath72 , @xmath71 has a number of eigenvalues close to one . according to the estimations of the arnoldi algorithm convergence rate ( see appendix c ) , these are the features that make the convergence unacceptably slow . + in order to improve convergence we first look for the origin of the negative part of the spectrum . for this",
    "we consider the values @xmath73 such as @xmath74 of the operator @xmath71 .",
    "evidently , they are simultaneously eigenvalues of the operator @xmath75 keeping in mind that the operator @xmath76 stands for a potential with extremely strong short - range repulsion , we conclude that the term @xmath77 produces extremely strong short - range attraction .",
    "therefore , the operator @xmath78 contains a large number of eigenvalues in the range @xmath79 $ ] and their presence suppresses the convergence of the arnoldi algorithm for values close to one .    to eliminate the negative eigenvalues from the spectrum , we introduce , instead of @xmath80 , the operator @xmath81 where @xmath82 corresponds to some strong short - range repulsive potential .",
    "it will be referred to as modifying potential .",
    "it can be shown that the eigenvalues @xmath83 of the operator @xmath84 correspond to the eigenvalues @xmath73 of the original faddeev operator and this does not depend upon the modifying potential .",
    "in contrast , the eigenvalues @xmath85 correspond to the eigenvalues @xmath86 of the equation @xmath87 { \\bf f}=0 \\ , .",
    "\\label{mzneg}\\ ] ] obviously , these eigenvalues depend on the choice of the modifying potential @xmath88 a proper choice of which will eliminate all eigenvalues of the equation ( [ mzneg ] ) in the range @xmath89 . thus , according to arnoldi algorithm convergence rate estimations , this feature of @xmath84 should dramatically improve the convergence to the maximal eigenvalue close to one .",
    "+ the convergence rate can be further improved if instead of the operator @xmath90 a properly selected function of @xmath90 is used in the calculations .",
    "one such function can be an even power of @xmath84 or the normalized chebyshev polynomial of the second kind @xmath91 .",
    "it allows an upward shifting of the lower bound of the spectrum and the increase of the separation between the physically interesting eigenvalues close to one and the rest part of the spectrum . according to the convergence rate estimations these features",
    "allow the reduction of the computation time and memory requirements considerably .",
    "we applied the aforementioned numerical procedure to study the spectrum of the he@xmath0 trimer system . for this purpose , we employed the most recent he  he potentials , namely , the sapt1 , sapt2 , and hfd - b3-fc11 potentials @xcite , and compare the results with those previously obtained @xcite using the lm2m2 @xcite and ttypt @xcite interactions , as well as with those obtained via other methods . + in table  [ tabtrimerev ] we present the results for the trimer ground and excited states .",
    "we also present , in the same table , the results obtained for the dimer binding energy @xmath92 calculated on the same grid used in three - body calculations as well as the exact results for the dimer @xmath93 .",
    "the difference between these values can be regarded as the lower bound for the error of our approach .",
    "+ in tables  [ tabconv2 ] and  [ tabconv ] we demonstrate the convergence , for the lm2m2 potential , of the calculated energies with respect to the number of grid points used .",
    "it is seen that convergence is achieved with a relatively low number of the @xmath94 points ( @xmath95 points ) while for the other coordinates the number is much larger ( @xmath96 points ) . +",
    "our results for the lm2m2 potential are given in table  [ tabcompare ] together with those obtained by motovilov _ et .",
    "@xcite via faddeev - type equations ( boundary condition model ( bcm ) ) and by nielsen _",
    "@xcite via the hyperspherical adiabatic approach .",
    "it is seen that an overall good agreement is achieved with these approaches .",
    "however , for the ground state a slightly better agreement is achieved with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite while for the excited state is with those of ref .",
    "@xcite . comparing our results with the results of @xcite",
    "we should emphasize , that the angular basis used by motovilov _ et .",
    "@xcite coincide with our spline basis for the simplest grid that can be used in the present method .",
    "performing calculations with this simplified grid , we recovered all the digits of the ground state energy reported in @xcite .",
    "this confirms the accuracy of their result and the suitability of the present method for bound state calculations .",
    "the better agreement for the excited state with the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite can be attributed to the 2 + 1 contribution to the faddeev component for the excited states .",
    "taking into account this term in the bcm is very difficult , whereas the hyperspherical adiabatic approach of nielsen _ et .",
    "@xcite is more suitable for this purpose .",
    "however , the ground state energy of @xcite is about 1% less than our result .",
    "consideration of the geometric properties of helium trimer can clarify the possible nature of the latter difference .",
    "+ the characteristic size of the bound states of the trimer can be estimated either by calculating @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
    "the results obtained for these radii are presented in tables  [ tabr ] and  [ tabr2 ] .",
    "it is seen that they are approximately 10 times less than the radii of the dimer molecule . however , the size of the excited state has the same order of magnitude as that of the dimer .",
    "+ the wave function of the system can be easily obtained from the faddeev component , @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are defined by ( [ xyzpm ] ) .",
    "the most intuitive way to visualize the results of the calculations is to draw the one - particle density function defined as @xmath103 where @xmath104 the functions @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 are obtained from the jacobi coordinates ( [ jacoord ] ) and ( [ intrcoord ] ) and the wave function @xmath108 is normalized to unity . due to the symmetry properties of the system , the one - particle density function depends only on the coordinate @xmath109 .",
    "taking into account the relation @xmath110 we get @xmath111 omitting the integration over @xmath94 , we obtain the conditional density function @xmath112 describing a spatial distribution for particle one when the other two particles are located along a fixed axis .",
    "it is useful to plot this function in coordinates @xmath113 such that @xmath114 is a projection of the position of particle 1 onto the axis connecting the other particles and @xmath115 is a projection to the orthogonal axis .",
    "three - dimensional plots of the function @xmath116 corresponding to the ground and excited states of the trimer calculated with the lm2m2 potential are presented in figs .",
    "[ lm2m2 g ] and [ lm2m2ex ] respectively",
    ". the conditional density function of the ground state decreases in all directions in a similar way .",
    "the density function of the excited state has two distinguishable maxima and exhibits the linear structure of the cluster .",
    "this structure has a simple physical explanation : the most probable positions of a particle in the excited state lie around the other two particles and when the latter particles are well separated the third one forms a dimer - like bound state with each of them .",
    "this interpretation agrees with the clusterisation coefficients presented in the table  [ tabclusterisat ] .",
    "these coefficients are calculated as a norm of the function @xmath117 defined by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the dimer wave function .",
    "the values of @xmath120 , shown in the table  [ tabclusterisat ] , demonstrate the dominating role of a two - body contribution to the trimer excited state whereas in the ground state this contribution is rather small .",
    "we could suppose that this dominating contribution of the cluster wave in the excited state ensured the fast convergence of the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion @xcite to the correct value , but in order to get the same order of accuracy for the ground state , possibly more basic functions should be taken into account . + the advantage of using faddeev equations over the schrdinger one in bound - state calculations , is deduced from the results shown in tables  [ tabangcontribfc ] and [ tabangcontribwf ] . in the latter table",
    "we present the contribution of different angular states to the faddeev component and to the wave function calculated as @xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , are the legendre polynomials and @xmath124 is the faddeev component or the wave function .",
    "the angular coefficients for the faddeev component decrease much faster than the wave function coefficients .",
    "this could explain the difference between the estimations of the trimer mean square radius reported in @xcite and the one presented here .",
    "in the previous paper the same angular basis for the faddeev component and the wave function has been used .",
    "however , it turned out that the contribution of the higher partial waves to the wave function is not negligible .",
    "this leads , for instance , to the change of the mean square radius of the excited state for the lm2m2 potential from 60.85    to 59.3  ",
    ". this observation agrees with the results of nielsen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who reported the value 60.86   using essentially the same angular basis both for the wave function and for the faddeev component .",
    "the table  [ tabangcontribfc ] also demonstrates that more angular functions should be taken into account in the ground state calculations .",
    "we present a method which can be used to perform accurate three - body bound states calculations .",
    "it is specially suited for systems where the interparticle forces have a strong repulsive core .",
    "the method is based on faddeev equations in the total angular momentum representation and without any further partial wave decomposition .",
    "the equations are expressed in terms of cartesian coordinates which are best suited to describe the long - range behavior of weakly three - body bound states .",
    "combined with the tensor - trick preconditioning for large linear systems and the arnoldi s algorithm for eigenanalysis it provided us accurate results for the the he@xmath0 trimer bound and excited states .",
    "+ results obtained with the most recent realistic intermolecular forces ( sapt1 , sapt2 , hfd - b3-fc11 ) , as well as with earlier forces ( lm2m2 , ttypt ) indicate that only two bound states exist .",
    "the properties of these states are very different with the ground state being strongly bound while the binding energy for the excited state is comparable to that of the dimer .",
    "the latter implies that a dimmer cluster within the molecule is well formed .",
    "+ the sizes of these two states also differs much .",
    "the characteristic size of the ground state either estimated by @xmath97 or @xmath98 is @xmath125 times less than the size of dimer molecule , but the size of the excited state has the same order of magnitude with that of the dimer .",
    "this estimation make it necessary to check for the absence of trimers in the experimental media during the measurement of dimer properties and vice versa .",
    "suppose @xmath126 is a partition in the range @xmath127 $ ] in coordinate @xmath128 and let @xmath129 be the space of quintique hermite splines associated with this partition _",
    "i.e. _ piecewise fifth order polynomial functions having two continuous derivatives in this range .",

    "suppose @xmath231 is a linear operator in a finite - dimensional space with @xmath232 let @xmath233 be a krylov subspace of dimension @xmath234 constructed from a starting vector @xmath235 of the operator @xmath236 and @xmath237 be an orthogonal projector to @xmath238 space .",
    "the convergence rate of the algorithm can be expressed in terms of the norm @xmath239 of the eigenvector @xmath240 projection onto the orthogonal completion to @xmath238 .",
    "suppose @xmath241 are the expansion coefficients of the starting vector @xmath242 in terms of the eigenvectors @xmath243 , @xmath244 then the following relation is fulfilled @xmath245 where @xmath246 and @xmath247 depends on the spectral properties of the operator @xmath236 .",

    "having defined the separation distance between the largest eigenvalue and the rest part of the spectrum @xmath257 , the distance between the maximal eigenvalues in the rest part @xmath258 and neglecting the imaginary part of the spectrum , we obtain the estimation @xmath259 therefore the parameter managing the convergence rate is the ratio @xmath260 of the separation to the size of the rest part of the spectrum .",
    "the convergence rate could be improved by enlarging the separation and by enhancing the remainder part of the spectrum localization .",
