    "many interesting applications of the nanometer periodic magnetic dot arrays are expected in the magnetic recording @xcite and magnetic sensors .",
    "the magnetic nanostructures represent model systems for study of interesting physical phenomena stemming from the well controlled dot shape anisotropy and dominance of magnetostatic interactions at the scales comparable or larger than dot size . the magnetostatics cause the coupling of domains over the inter - dot interfaces .",
    "the current perspective technologies require understanding and controlling of dynamic magnetization processes in fine particles on nanoscales , because by them the magnetic bits are written into recording media .",
    "hence of particular interest is the dynamics of magnetization reversal .",
    "the static and dynamic nonuniform magnetization states in magnetic nanostructures including the thin films and isolated small particles have been studied by micromagnetic @xcite and monte carlo @xcite simulations . on a qualitative level",
    "intra - dot nonuniformities can be characterized as a superpositions of vortices , flowers , domain walls , etc .. the problem of nonuniformities in exchange - dominated structures can be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "our recent activity is directed to algorithms allowing systematic and fast classification of simulated magnetic structures .",
    "the methodology presented in this paper is inspired by the progress in the theory of artificial neural networks that are nonlinear models suitable to reduce , classify or interpolate data structures representing the complex patterns @xcite . in the previous paper",
    "@xcite we suggested the implementation of radial basis function networks to model the ordering of dots in arrays . in the next paper @xcite the neural network training was applied to multiscale numerical computations .",
    "the lack of our previous two approaches was the absence of realistic dynamics and restriction to quasi - static limit . in the present paper our interest",
    "is focused to the networks which analyze spin configurations generated by the spin lattice dynamical simulations .",
    "it means that network solves here classical post - processing problem known in the micromagnetic context @xcite .",
    "our approach has many in common with experiment treatment @xcite , where self - organized network was employed to identification of vortex modes of magnetic thin film media . in the presented paper",
    "the classification is applied to configurations generated by the magnetization reversal within the xy superlattice model of ultra - dense array .",
    "the motivation for study of ultra - dense spin structures was the expectation of extremal inter - dot effects .",
    "the main reason for the choice of the xy spin model is relative computational simplicity of 2-d dynamics .",
    "but there are two regimes for which 2-d approximation is justified physically .",
    "( i )  the first regime belongs to limit of very strong damping which suppresses precession and accelerates reversal @xcite .",
    "( ii )  the second regime represents limit of strong in - plain @xcite or shape anisotropy associated with demagnetization field of thin film sample @xcite . in this regime anisotropy causes deformation of spin trajectory and accelerates reversal @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one should to note that realistic damping is sufficiently small , and thus 2-d remagnetization is practically quasistatic . in the quasistatic limit the damping parameter has meaning of auxiliary parameter rescaling the time .",
    "recent results obtained for discrete spin systems provide more optimistic view on the valuation of artificial dynamics of reversal .",
    "the example is the simulation of @xcite demonstrating that switching time monte carlo dependences can coincide after some rescaling with predictions of the stochastic landau - lifshitz equation .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "the interaction picture and dynamics of array model are defined in section  [ xy_model ] .",
    "the simulations of array reversal are presented and discussed in section  [ results1 ] .",
    "the details of adaptive neural network treatment of intra - dot configurations are given in subsection  [ art1 ] .",
    "in this section we formulate the interaction picture and dynamics of ultra dense array model .",
    "the magnetic ordering is described by the systems of the classical planar spins located on the square two dimensional lattice .",
    "the spin on site @xmath1 is affected by effective field @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the planar spin , @xmath4 is the external magnetic field in energy units , @xmath5 is the linear size of the square @xmath6 spin lattice system . here and in further @xmath7 , @xmath8 denote the unit vectors along the main cartesian axes .",
    "rather convenient for a computer purposes is to use one dimensional enumeration scheme of spin sites @xmath9 .",
    "( all of the geometric details presented in this section are discussed in the appendix  [ 1d_enumeration ] . ) the first sum of eq.([excheq ] ) represents dipolar contribution proportional to constant @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is vector pointing from site @xmath1 to @xmath12 .",
    "the vector is measured in lattice constant units , @xmath13 is the auxiliary unit vector .",
    "the second sum of eq.([excheq ] ) involves nearest neighbor exchange coupling term @xmath14 determined by single parameter @xmath15 multiplying the site - site connectivity matrix @xmath16 constrained by @xmath17 condition ; @xmath18 is @xmath19 for any bond at inter - dot boundary and @xmath20 inside a dot .",
    "the site dependence of @xmath18 takes into account square shape of dot of the linear size @xmath21 .",
    "the spin system partitioned by @xmath18 consists of @xmath22 dots with minimum inter - dot distance equal to the unit lattice spacing and corresponding to extremal space filling .    in 2-d case landau - lifshitz equation reduces to damping term . the numerical integration scheme discussed in appendix [ integ_scheme ]",
    "can be derived from recursive propagator form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is instant angular frequency of the spin rotation , @xmath25 is the time integration step , @xmath26 is the reduced time related to real time @xmath27 as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is permeability of free space , @xmath30 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath31 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "the unitarity of spin rotation matrix @xmath32 implies that numerical scheme adapted from eq.([intscheme ] ) conserves the spin vector size independently of @xmath33 quadrature .    the time demanding task represents summation of dipolar fields .",
    "the substantial reduction of time allows the use of the hierarchical approach @xcite with a detailed summation of near and rough summation of far field contributions .",
    "the specific geometry of array leads to the natural spin block definition @xmath34 where sum runs over the spins of index @xmath12 belonging to dot index @xmath35 and dot position @xmath36 . in frame of two - level hierarchical approximation dipolar field",

    "the summation rule is controlled by the scale - separation cut - off @xmath42 .",
    "in this section we present the simulations of the square shaped finite array including @xmath0 spins . to analyze the simulation outputs we applied : ( i )  the qualitative recognition of the configuration snapshots ; ( ii )  the comparing of the complex array dynamics with the dynamics of much simpler systems ; ( iii )  the clustering of intra - dot magnetic configurations using neural networks .",
    "the global information on the array ordering concerns the magnetization per site @xmath43 the simulations were performed for uniform zero @xmath44 and non - zero bias @xmath45 , @xmath46 initial conditions . in both cases the characteristic time of array is the time when @xmath47 projection gains at first the bound @xmath48      to obtain the preliminary qualitative information about the switching mechanism we run the simulation of reversal dynamics in the field @xmath49 and coupling @xmath50 for dot size @xmath51 and bias @xmath52 . under these conditions we obtained estimate @xmath53 .    at the beginning of reversal",
    "the external magnetic field nucleates reversal domains at the corners of dots .",
    "the recognition of simulated systems shows that remagnetization is more homogeneous and easier when dots are localized at the corners of array , whereas nonuniformities occur due to mirror symmetry of effective fields typical for dots standing in positions closer to axial zone of array .",
    "this property is illustrated by snapshot taken at characteristic time as is shown in fig .",
    "the typical for nonuniform remagnetization is that reverse domains , which gain external field polarity , grow from the dot corners and pass toward the dot centers . at the intermediate stages domain walls - _ nonlinear waves _",
    "@xcite between reverse and initial polarity domains become narrow . in the context with nanoparticles and our small - scale simulations",
    "we prefer to use the term nonlinear wave instead of domain wall since nonlinear wave better expresses nonlocal character of arising spin structures . at the final stage of the inhomogeneous reversal",
    "the sum of external and dipolar field can , if sufficiently strong , homogenize intra - dot ordering by annihilating of _ wave / anti - wave pairs _",
    "similar mechanism was studied in detail for linear spin chain @xcite . as we see from the scheme depicted in fig .",
    "[ model_premag ] the reversal mechanism in dots is position and time dependent for finite size arrays .",
    "the formation of wap is an example of inhomogeneous remagnetization .",
    "the process is characteristic for later times and dots placed nearly the axial array zone as is depicted in fig .",
    "the parallelism between spin chain and array behavior inspired the monitoring of spin projections summarized in fig .",
    "[ solitons ] .",
    "the figure shows @xmath54 components taken from several superlattice site lines crossing array in external field direction .",
    "the time sequence of these projections reveals that each inter - dot interface acts as a phase - shifter of wap formed in different dots .",
    "the consequence of inter - dot coupling is the large - scale wap with shape resembling its small - scale intra - dot counterpart ( see fig .",
    "[ sim_soliton ] ) .",
    "it is rather surprising that for its build up magnetostatic forces suffice .",
    "the spatio - temporal _ two - scale similarity _ of magnetic ordering illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sim_dot_array ] originates from spatial distribution of dipolar fields of square - shaped dots embedded into square - shaped array .",
    "we continue with the comparing of @xmath55 dependences for patterned structure as well as for the isolated dots with zero and non - zero bias .",
    "the varying of @xmath21 is in some sense equivalent to varying of dipolar and exchange coupling contributions .",
    "the results for patterning @xmath56 for @xmath57 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ t_ch_l_0 ] , where the characteristic times of the interacting and isolated dots are also compared . from the simulations it follows that inhomogeneities grow as @xmath21 increases .",
    "the reverse phase nucleates preferentially at dot surfaces and reduces @xmath58 in larger dots .",
    "if inter - dot interactions are considered @xmath55 dependences look smoother than dependences obtained for isolated dots .",
    "the interactions affect spatial dispersion of @xmath59 , which means that some dots are accelerated and some decelerated during reversal .",
    "the simulations of isolated dots show that differences between zero and non - zero bias are larger for smaller @xmath21 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath58 due to uniform bias @xmath60 is a manifestation of the stoner - wohlfarth coherent regime .      in this section minimal four - spin model and complete array model of magnetization reversal",
    "are discussed and compared . the _ minimal model _",
    "consists of four spins arranged to @xmath64 square segment of unit size . in the segment",
    "four nearest pairs are coupled by the exchange interaction and all of the pairs by dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "despite of substantial geometric truncation , all of the interactions considered for array take place in four - spin model .",

    "[ fourmers ] .",
    "they consist of two qualitatively different regimes separated by bifurcation point @xmath66 manifested by @xmath67 cusp . at @xmath68 several modes compete , the interaction and external fields are nearly balanced and frustrated spins need quite long time to select the winning mode . for @xmath69",
    "the reversal is very susceptible to choice of initial bias .",
    "it is easy to check that even small @xmath60 accelerates reversal and stabilizes coherent or quasi - coherent rotation in coincidence with the stoner - wohlfarth scenario .",
    "further simplification of four - spin dynamics which clarifies situation can be done assuming the total _ coherence _ of spins .",
    "the consequence is the elimination of three angular variables and analytic expression @xmath70 where @xmath71 is undimensional parameter proportional to damping parameter @xmath72 .",
    "the expression obtained in the limit @xmath73 is rather well known @xmath74 for @xmath75 the integral eq.([fourmer1 ] ) leads to finite @xmath65 even in the case @xmath52 .",
    "it means that dipolar coupling removes logarithmic divergence @xmath76 of @xmath65 and substitutes in part the effect of @xmath60 . in the regime",
    "@xmath69 the bias @xmath52 induces non - uniform flower mode belonging to characteristic time which is out of the scope of eq.([fourmer1 ] ) .",
    "the four - spin dynamics attained by simulation for @xmath77 is even more complex . in that case",
    "the choice of bias losses its dynamical relevance .",
    "the simulations show that quite short time is needed to form the transient long - living flower mode ( long with respect to @xmath65 ) which alters to vortex mode at final stages .    with the four - spin system behavior in mind",
    "the attention is turned now to the _ complex array dynamics_. as we see from fig .",

    "the position of @xmath79 can be estimated as @xmath81 .",
    "the configuration snapshots show that near @xmath79 the array consists of spin configuration loops of diameters approaching single dot size or size of several dots . for @xmath82",
    "the array reversal generates non - collinear antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "the common feature of oversimplified four - spin model and array simulation is that finite @xmath65 and @xmath58 are attained even for @xmath52 due to non - collinearity of external and dipolar fields . from dependences depicted in figs .",
    "[ t_ch_l_0 ]  and  [ tch_vs_dj ] it follows that geometric variations in @xmath21 can produce less remarkable changes than @xmath83 parameters .    for completeness the external field dependences of characteristic time",
