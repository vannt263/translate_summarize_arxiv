    "electron scattering reactions with nuclei have provided the most detailed and complete information on nuclear and nucleon structure @xcite .",
    "additional information is available from neutrino - nucleus scattering .",
    "neutrinos can excite nuclear modes unaccessible in electron scattering , can give information on the hadronic weak current and on the strange nucleon form factors .",
    "although of great interest , such studies are not the only aim of many neutrino experiments , which are better aimed at a precise determination of neutrino properties . in neutrino oscillation experiments nuclei are used to detect neutrinos .",
    "a proper analysis of data requires that the nuclear response to neutrino interactions is well under control and that the unavoidable theoretical uncertainties on nuclear effects are reduced as much as possible .",
    "different models developed and successfully tested in comparison with electron scattering data have been extended to neutrino - nucleus scattering .",
    "although the two situations are different , electron scattering is the best available guide to determine the prediction power of a nuclear model .",
    "nonrelativistic and relativistic models have been used to describe nuclear effects with different approximations .",
    "relativity is important at all energies , in particular at high energies , and in the energy regime of many neutrino experiments a fully relativistic approach is required .",
    "relativistic models for the exclusive and inclusive electron and neutrino scattering in the qe region are presented in this contribution . in the qe region",
    "the nuclear response is dominated by one - nucleon knockout processes , where the probe interacts with a quasifree nucleon that is emitted from the nucleus with a direct one - step mechanism and the remaining nucleons are spectators . in electron scattering experiments the outgoing nucleon can be detected in coincidence with the scattered electron . in the exclusive @xmath0 reaction the residual nucleus",
    "is left in a specific discrete eigenstate and the final state is completely specified . in the inclusive @xmath1 scattering the outgoing nucleon",
    "is not detected and the cross section includes all the available final nuclear states .    for an incident neutrino ( antineutrino ) nc and cc scattering can be considered @xmath2 in nc scattering only the emitted nucleon can be detected and the cross section is integrated over the energy and angle of the final lepton .",
    "also the state of the residual @xmath3-nucleus is not determined and the cross section is summed over all the available final states .",
    "the same situation occurs for the cc reaction if only the outgoing nucleon is detected .",
    "the cross sections are therefore semi - inclusive in the hadronic sector and inclusive in the leptonic one and can be treated as an @xmath0 reaction where only the outgoing proton is detected . the exclusive cc process where the charged final lepton is detected in coincidence with the emitted nucleon can be considered as well . the inclusive cc scattering where only the charged lepton is detected can be treated with the same models used for the inclusive @xmath1 reaction .    for all these processes the cross section is obtained in the one - boson exchange approximation from the contraction between the lepton tensor , that depends only on the lepton kinematics , and the hadron tensor @xmath4 , that contains the nuclear response and whose components are given by bilinear products of the matrix elements of the nuclear current @xmath5 between the initial and final nuclear states , i.e. , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the energy and momentum transfer , respectively .",
    "different but consistent models to calculate @xmath4 in qe electron and neutrino - nucleus scattering are outlined in the next sections .",
    "models based on the relativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) have been developed @xcite to describe the exclusive reaction where the outgoing nucleon is detected in coincidence with the scattered lepton and the residual nucleus is left in a discrete eigenstate @xmath9 . in rdwia",
    "the amplitudes of  ( [ eq.wmn ] ) are obtained in a one - body representation as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the single- particle ( s.p . )",
    "scattering state of the emitted nucleon , @xmath12 is the overlap between the ground state of the target and the final state @xmath9 , i.e. , a s.p .",
    "bound state , and @xmath13 is the one - body nuclear current . in the model the s.p .",
    "bound and scattering states are consistently derived as eigenfunctions of a feshbach - type optical potential @xcite .",
    "phenomenological ingredients are adopted in the calculations .",
    "the bound states are dirac - hartree solutions of a lagrangian , containing scalar and vector potentials , obtained in the framework of the relativistic mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "the scattering state is calculated solving the dirac equation with relativistic energy - dependent complex optical potentials @xcite .",
    "rdwia models have been quite successful in describing a large amount of data ( cross sections , response functions and polarization observables ) for the exclusive @xmath14 reaction @xcite .",
    "the transition amplitudes of the nc and cc processes where only the outgoing nucleon is detected are described as the sum of the rdwia amplitudes in  ( [ eq.dko ] ) over the states @xmath9 . in the calculations",
    "@xcite a pure shell - model ( sm ) description is assumed , i.e. , @xmath9 is a one - hole state and the sum is over all the occupied sm states .",
    "fsi are described by a complex optical potential whose imaginary part gives an absorption that reduces the calculated cross section .",
    "a similar reduction is found in @xmath14 calculations .",
    "the imaginary part accounts for the flux lost in a specific channel towards other channels .",
    "this approach is conceptually correct for an exclusive reaction , where only one channel contributes , but it would be wrong for the inclusive scattering , where all the channels contribute and the total flux must be conserved . for the semi - inclusive process where an emitted nucleon is detected , some of the reaction channels which are responsible for the imaginary part of the potential , are not included in the experimental cross section and it is correct to include in the calculations the absorptive imaginary part .",
    "there are , however , contributions that are not included in this model and that can be included in the experimental cross section , for instance , contributions due to multi - step processes .",
    "the relevance of these contributions depends on kinematics and should not be large in the qe region .",
    "in the inclusive scattering where only the outgoing lepton is detected fsi are treated in the green s function ( gf ) approach @xcite . in this model the components of the hadron tensor are written in terms of the s.p .",
    "optical model green s function .",
    "this is the result of suitable approximations , such as the assumption of a one - body current and subtler approximations related to the ia .",
    "the explicit calculation of the s.p .",
    "green s function is avoided by its spectral representation , which is based on a biorthogonal expansion in terms of a non hermitian optical potential @xmath15 and of its hermitian conjugate @xmath16 .",
    "calculations require matrix elements of the same type as the rdwia ones in eq .",
    "[ eq.dko ] , but involve eigenfunctions of both @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the imaginary part gives in one case an absorption and in the other case a gain of flux , and in the sum over @xmath9 the total flux is redistributed and conserved .",
    "the gf approach guarantees a consistent treatment of fsi in the exclusive and in the inclusive scattering and gives a good description of @xmath1 data @xcite .",

    "the cross sections obtained when only the real part of the relativistic optical potential ( rrop ) is retained and the imaginary part is neglected are also shown in the figure .",
    "this approximation conserves the flux , but it is conceptually wrong because the optical potential has to be complex owing to the presence of inelastic channels .",
    "the differences between the rrop , gf1 , and gf2 results are due to the imaginary part of the optical potential .",
    "different parameterizations give similar real terms and the rrop cross sections are practically insensitive to the choice of the optical potential .",

    "then the results of different descriptions of fsi have been compared .",

    "[ fig1 ] are compared with the results of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model @xcite , where the scattering wave functions are calculated with the same real potential used for the initial bound states .",
    "the rmf model fulfills the dispersion relation and maintains the continuity equation .",
    "the differences between the rmf and gf results increase with the momentum transfer . also the discrepancies between the gf1 and gf2 cross sections depend on the momentum transfer . at @xmath26 = 500",
    "mev@xmath24 the three results are similar , both in magnitude and shape .",
    "moderate differences are found at @xmath26 = 800 mev@xmath24 , and larger differences at @xmath27 mev@xmath24 .",
    "the shape of the rmf cross section shows an asymmetry , with a long tail extending towards higher values of @xmath7 , that is essentially due to the strong energy - independent scalar and vector potentials present in the rmf approach .",
    "the asymmetry towards higher @xmath7 is less significant but still visible for gf1 and gf2 , whose cross sections show a similar shape but with a significant difference in the magnitude . at @xmath26 = 1000 mev@xmath24",
    "both gf1 and gf2 cross sections are higher than the rmf one in the region where the maximum occurs .",
    "a stronger enhancement is obtained with gf1 , which at the peak overshoots the rmf cross section up to @xmath28 .",
    "the behaviour of the rmf and gf results as a function of @xmath26 and @xmath7 is linked to the structure of the relativistic potentials involved in the rmf and gf models .",
    "whereas rmf is based on the use of a strong energy - independent real potential , gf makes use of a complex energy - dependent optical potential . in gf calculations",
    "the behavior of the optical potential changes with the momentum and energy transferred in the process , and higher values of @xmath26 and @xmath7 correspond to higher energies for the optical potential .",
    "the gf results are consistent with the general behavior of the optical potentials and are basically due to their imaginary part , that includes the overall effect of the inelastic channels and is not univocally determined by the elastic phenomenology .",
    "different parameterizations give similar real terms and the rrop cross sections are practically insensitive to the choice of the optical potential .",
    "the real part decreases increasing the energy and the rrop result approaches the rpwia one for large values of @xmath7 @xcite . in contrast , the imaginary part has its maximum strength around 500 mev and is sensitive to the parameterization of the rop .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the gf1 , gf2 , and rmf results are compared with the experimental cross sections for three different kinematics .",
    "the three models lead to similar cross sections .",
    "the main differences are presented for higher values of @xmath26 , about 800 mev/@xmath29 ( bottom panel ) , where the gf1 cross section is larger than the gf2 and rmf ones . the experimental cross section is slightly underpredicted in the top panel and well described in the middle panel by all calculations .",
    "the results in the bottom panel show a fair agreement with data for gf1 , whereas gf2 and rmf underpredict the experiment .",
    "although satisfactory on general grounds , the comparison with data gives here only an indication and can not be conclusive until contributions beyond the qe peak , like meson exchange currents and @xmath30 effects , which may play a significant role in the analysis of data even at the maximum of the qe peak , are carefully evaluated @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the results of the pavia and madrid - sevilla groups has been extended to the scaling properties of the different relativistic models @xcite .    scaling ideas applied to inclusive qe electron - nucleus scattering",
    "have been shown to work properly to high accuracy @xcite . at sufficiently high momentum transfer a scaling function",
    "is derived dividing the experimental @xmath25 cross sections by an appropriate single - nucleon cross section .",
    "this is basically the idea of the ia .",
    "if this scaling function depends only upon one kinematical variable , the scaling variable , one has scaling of first kind .",
    "if the scaling function is roughly the same for all nuclei , one has scaling of second kind .",
    "when both kinds of scaling are fulfilled , one says that superscaling occurs .",
    "an extensive analysis of electron scattering data has shown that scaling of first kind is fulfilled at the left of the qe peak and broken at its right , whereas scaling of second kind is well satisfied at the left of the peak and not so badly violated at its right . a phenomenological scaling function",
    "@xmath31 has been extracted from data of the longitudinal response in the qe region .",
    "the dimensioneless scaling variable @xmath32 is extracted from the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) analysis that incorporates the typical momentum scale for the selected nucleus @xcite .",
    "although many models based on the ia exhibit superscaling , even perfectly as the rfg , only a few of them are able to reproduce the asymmetric shape of @xmath31 with a significant tail extended to high values of @xmath7 ( large positive values of @xmath33 ) .",
    "one of these is the rmf model where fsi are described by the same real relativistic potential used for the initial bound states .",
    "in contrast , the rpwia and rrop , although satisfying superscaling properties , lead to symmetrical - shape scaling functions which are not in accordance with data analysis @xcite .     500 , 800 , and 1000 mev@xmath24 with the gf1 ( solid ) , gf2 ( long dot - dashed ) , and rmf ( dashed ) models compared with the averaged experimental scaling function .",
    "[ fig4],width=377 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the scaling function @xmath34 evaluated with rmf , gf1 , and gf2 for different values of @xmath26 are compared to the phenomenological function @xmath31 .",
    "the rmf model produces an asymmetric shape with a long tail in the region with @xmath35 that follows closely the phenomenological function behavior .",
    "the gf results are similar to the rmf ones at @xmath26 = 500 mev@xmath24 and , with moderate differences , at @xmath26 = 800 mev@xmath24 , while visible discrepancies appear at @xmath26 = 1000 mev@xmath24 .",
    "the discussion is similar to the one applied to the cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . the asymmetric shape with a tail in the region of positive @xmath36 is obtained with both rmf and gf . the different dependence on @xmath26 shown by the potentials involved in rmf and gf makes the tail of the gf scaling function less pronounced as the value of @xmath26 goes up .",
    "except for the highest value of @xmath26 considered ( 1000 mev/@xmath29 ) , gf1 , gf2 . and rmf yield very similar predictions for @xmath34 , in good agreement with the experimental function .",
    "the asymmetric tail of the data and the strength at the peak are fairly reproduced by the three approaches . for @xmath37 mev/@xmath29",
    ", however , only rmf seems to be favoured from the comparison to data , while gf1 and gf2 yield rather different predictions than rmf , that seem to be ruled out by data .",
    "we note that as the momentum transfer increases the phenomenological optical potentials , that is used as input in the gf approach , will ( implicitely ) incorporate a larger amount of contributions from non nucleonic degrees of freedom , such as , for instance , the loss of ( elastic ) flux into the inelastic @xmath30 excitation with or without real pion production .",
    "thus the input of the gf formalism is contaminated by non purely nucleonic contributions .",
    "as a consequence , gf predictions depart from the experimental qe longitudinal response , that effectively isolates only nucleonic contributions .",
    "this difference , which increases with increasing @xmath26 , emerges as an excess of strength predicted by the gf model as it translates a loss of flux due to non - nucleonic processes into inclusive purely nucleonic strength . on the other hand ,",
    "the rmf model uses as input the effective mean field that reproduces the saturation properties of nuclear matter and of the ground state of the nuclei involved , and it is more suited to estimate the purely nucleonic contribution to the inclusive cross - section , even at @xmath37 mev/@xmath29 .",
    "relativistic models developed for qe electron scattering and successfully tested in comparison with experimental data have been extended to calculate cc and nc neutrino - nucleus cross sections . in the models",
    "nuclear effects are treated consistently in exclusive , semi - inclusive , and inclusive reactions .",
    "the comparison of different models is important to reduce theoretical uncertainties on nuclear effects .",
    "the results of the relativistic models developed by the pavia and the madrid - sevilla groups to describe fsi in the inclusive qe electron - nucleus scattering have been compared .",
    "the consistency of the calculations of the two groups has been checked in rpwia and rrop . then",
    "two different models based on the ria have been compared : the gf approach of the pavia group , that is based on the use of the complex relativistic optical potential and which allows one to treat fsi consistently in the inclusive and exclusive reactions , and the rmf model of the madrid - sevilla group , where the distorted waves are obtained with the same real relativistic mean field considered for the bound states .",
    "results are compared for the differential cross sections and scaling functions .",
    "discrepancies increase with the momentum transfer .",
    "this is linked to the energy - dependent optical potentials involved in the gf method by contrast to the energy - independent rmf potentials .",
    "all models considered respect scaling and superscaling properties . the significant asymmetry in the scaling function produced by the rmf model is strongly supported by data @xcite .",
    "the relativistic gf approach leads to similar results to rmf , i.e. , with the asymmetry for intermediate @xmath26-values .",
    "visible discrepancies emerge for larger @xmath26 , being the gf scaling function tail less pronounced but showing more strength in the maximum region . moreover ,",
    "the gf results for high @xmath26 present a strong dependence on the parameterization of the optical potential , in particular of its imaginary part .",
    "the gf approach , even based on the use of a complex optical potential , conserves the flux and the imaginary term redistributes the strength among different channels .",
    "this explains the difference observed between rmf and gf predictions , the latter with additional strength in the region close to the maximum in the qe response.this behavior could be connected with effects coming from the contribution of the @xmath30 which are , somehow , accounted for in a phenomenological way by the gf approach , modifying the responses even in the region where the qe peak gives the main contribution .",
    "we must keep in mind that the higher the momentum transfer , the stronger the overlap between the qe and @xmath30 peaks , and it is very difficult to isolate contributions coming from either region .",
    "the similarities of the gf and rmf predictions , particularly for intermediate values of @xmath26 , and the very reasonable agreement with the data for the longitudinal scaled response are a clear indication that both models make a very decent job in estimating the inclusive contribution .",
