    "in qed , the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect interpolates between the bethe - heitler and factorization limit for the radiation spectrum of a charged particle undergoing multiple , @xmath4 say , scatterings in a medium . if the separation between scattering centers is very large , then the radiation off these centers reduces to a sum of radiation spectra for @xmath4 small - angle scatterings - this is the bethe - heitler limit . in the opposite limit , when the scattering centers sit too close together to be resolved by the emitted photon , the observed radiation factorizes into a product of a single scattering bethe - heitler spectrum for momentum transfer @xmath5 and the elastic cross section for the momentum transfer @xmath6 accumulated over @xmath4 small - angle scatterings .",
    "as first noted by landau and pomeranchuk  @xcite , the relevant length scale for the interpolation between bethe - heitler and factorization limit is the coherence length ( formation length ) @xmath7 , determined by the longitudinal momentum transfer @xmath8 , @xmath9 this characterizes the longitudinal scale on which the radiated particle becomes distinguishable from its radiating parent .",
    "scattering amplitudes for the radiation off different scattering centers interfer destructively if their separation is less than @xmath7 : the _ coherent _ factorization limit is suppressed in the ultrarelativistic limit with respect to the _ incoherent _ bethe - heitler limit .    for a quantitative description of the lpm interference effect , the relative phases of the different contributions to the @xmath4-fold scattering amplitude matter .",
    "these depend on the transverse energies and thus require knowledge about the transverse motion of the radiating particle in the medium .",
    "migdal  @xcite was the first to develop a dynamical description to this aim , employing a two - dimensional fokker - planck transport equation  @xcite for the hard parton . in the limit of an infinite medium ,",
    "his well - known result shows a characteristic @xmath10 low frequency suppression of @xmath11 compared to the constant dependence in the bethe - heitler limit , i.e. , the coherent factorization limit for @xmath12 vanishes .",
    "this is , however , only a very special feature of migdal s limiting case , where the formation length goes to infinity for @xmath12 , but never exceeds the ( infinite ) extension @xmath13 of the medium . for a medium of finite size ,",
    "the formation length does exceed the system size below some critical frequency @xmath14 , and the bethe - heitler limit is finite .",
    "migdals @xmath15-dependence is hence not valid for @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , additional effects become important for the radiation spectrum at lower frequencies  @xcite .",
    "most notably , this is the transition radiation and the ter - mikaelian effect  @xcite of dielectric suppression .",
    "the renewed interest in the lpm - effect has at least two reasons : on the one hand , fourty years after discovering the theoretical principles  @xcite , the first precision measurements of the lpm - effect  @xcite ( and the ter - mikaelian effect  @xcite ) were made recently by the slac-146 collaboration . on the other hand , with the advent of a new generation of relativistic heavy ion colliders at rhic and lhc ,",
    "the understanding of the non - abelian analogue becomes important .",
    "in the qed case , the experiment explored relatively thin targets with @xmath17 on the order 0.1 to 10 , in which the transition between bethe - heitler and factorization limit occurs . for a quantitative understanding",
    ", a realistic theory has to account for the finite extension of the target , the multiple elastic scatterings in the target , multiple photon emission , and possibly additional complications like radiation off structured targets .",
    "there are at least three modern approaches , which can account in principle for the lpm - effect in realistic targets .",
    "they implement the eikonal approximation for the radiating hard particle in different ways : i ) blankenbecler and drell  @xcite ( see also baier and katkov  @xcite ) started from the solution of the klein - gordon equation for the charged particle in the presence of an external field .",
    "the solution was approximated to order @xmath18 in a high energy expansion in which the eikonal path of the radiating particle is recovered .",
    "ii ) zakharov  @xcite proposed a light - cone path integral formulation which describes in a coordinate - space representation the transverse momentum kicks on the eikonal path , mimicking the elastic scatterings by an effective dipole cross section .",
    "zakharov s work  @xcite provides the most accurate description of the measured data so far .",
    "as we shall see in section  [ sec2c ] , his starting point is closely related to a high energy expansion of the dirac equation in the presence of an external potential .",
    "iii ) a third approach is due to r. baier et al .",
    "( bdmps )  @xcite , who started from the radiation amplitudes for @xmath4-fold scattering in the eikonal approximation . for qed ,",
    "the consistency of their approach and the work of blankenbecler and drell can be checked diagrammatically  @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the lpm effect also exists for non - equilibrium conditions  @xcite .    in the qcd case",
    ", high @xmath19 gev jets will be one of the new probes of the dense matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "deviations from factorized perturbative qcd due to final state rescattering are sensitive to the density and coupling in the plasma and will affect key observables like the high momentum tails of single particle spectra .",
    "the corresponding study of qcd radiative energy loss due to final state rescattering was initiated by gyulassy and wang  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been extended most notably in a series of papers by bdmps  @xcite using equal time perturbation theory .",
    "also , zakharov has pointed out that his formalism can be adopted to qcd bremsstrahlung with a dipole prescription  @xcite , and the equivalence of zakharov s formalism with the work of bdmps was sketched  @xcite .",
    "all these calculations of the lpm - effect in qcd , however , are ( 1 ) limited to the cases of infinitely many or very few ( @xmath20 ) rescatterings of the parton , and ( 2 ) they mainly focus on the angular integrated energy loss @xmath21 in which the transverse momentum dependence of the radiation pattern is averaged out .",
    "this energy loss , however , is not a good observable for qcd , because the parton shower is not directly observable due to hadronization .",
    "in addition , the qcd bremsstrahlung of hard jets must compete with the hard radiation associated with the jet production . to detect modifications of this hard vacuum bremsstrahlung spectrum due to final state rescattering",
    "requires knowledge about the angular distribution of the spectrum . in qcd ,",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of the lpm - effect is thus indispensable for a quantitative understanding of radiative energy loss .",
    "recently , kopeliovich , schfer and tarasov ( kst )  @xcite have used the furry approximation of the dirac equation in order to account for the transverse momentum dependence of the radiation spectrum emitted in a multiple scattering process . for the case of qcd bremsstrahlung radiation , they translate their qed results into qcd via an _ a posteriori _ dipole prescription ( [ 5.1 ] ) .",
    "this strategy is frequently used not only for the calculation of the radiative energy loss of high @xmath22 partons  @xcite , but also for the description of nuclear shadowing in the target rest frame  @xcite and for related problems of diffractive dissociation of virtual photons  @xcite .    as we show in what follows , an extension of the kst - formalism has great potential for the calculation of radiative energy loss in realistic scenarios since ( 1 ) it provides a smooth interpolation between the cases of infinitely many and very few rescatterings and ( 2 ) it allows to compare qed - inspired calculations of qcd radiative energy loss with perturbative qcd results .",
    "the present work focuses on the general formalism , its region of validity , and a qualitative discussion of its generic features .",
    "it gives expressions which allow for the numerical calculation of the radiation spectrum as a function of the medium density and extension , but it leaves phenomenological applications to further publications .    our work is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , we derive the starting point of our discussion , the radiation spectrum ( [ 2.22 ] ) .",
    "we discuss how a technical complication , the regularization of this spectrum , can be dealt with analytically , and we calculate the corresponding integrated energy loss",
    ". section  [ sec3 ] focuses on limiting cases of the general radiation formula ( [ 2.22 ] ) .",
    "we derive the radiation spectra for @xmath23 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 scatterings and we show that these reproduce the bethe - heitler and the factorization limit . in section  [ sec4 ] , the dipole approximation of the radiation spectrum ( [ 2.22 ] ) is discussed .",
    "this gives access to true in medium properties of the radiation spectrum which can not be obtained from an expansion to finite order in the coupling constant .",
    "finally , we discuss in section  [ sec5 ] how this method can be extended to qcd and how it compares to results from perturbative qcd .",
    "our main results are summarized in the conclusion .",
    "an expansion of the lpm - radiation cross section in orders of the coupling constant is essentially an expansion in the number of elastic scatterings , since each elastic scattering mott cross section is proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , a high energy expansion of the solution of the dirac equation in the presence of an external field takes to leading order in @xmath18 an arbitrary number of elastic scatterings into account . in this section",
    ", we derive the corresponding high energy limit of the qed radiation cross section for a hard electron , traversing a medium of longitudinal density @xmath25 .",
    "the physics contained in our main result ( [ 2.22 ] ) will be discussed in the following sections  [ sec3 ] - [ sec5 ] .",
    "our approach in  [ sec2a ] parallels to a large extent that of kopeliovich , schfer and tarasov ( kst ) in ref .",
    "we present the derivation in full detail to introduce our notation and to discuss all the approximations involved in the calculation .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , our radiation cross section ( [ 2.22 ] ) contains an @xmath26-regularization whose treatment is discussed in subsection  [ sec2b ] .",
    "then we show that the kst - formalism results in an angular integrated energy loss formula from which modifications to zakharov s formalism  @xcite can be obtained .",

    "this is allowed since the longitudinal distances in a multiple scattering problem are much larger than the transverse ones .",
