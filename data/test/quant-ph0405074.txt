    "one of the key technologies for quantum information and computation is purification / distillation of quantum states @xcite .",
    "particular pure states , such as entangled states , often play significant roles there , but it is not easy to find such `` clean '' states in nature .",
    "it is therefore required to prepare them out of mixed states ; otherwise , we can not carry out any interesting ideas of quantum information and computation .    a new purification mechanism has recently been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is shown that repeated measurements on a system , say a , result in a purification of another system , say b , in interaction with a @xcite .",
    "that is , the state of b is driven to a pure state irrespectively of its ( generally mixed ) initial state , if certain conditions are satisfied .",
    "remarkably , if appropriate adjustment of the relevant parameters is possible , the maximal yield , which is prescribed by the initial mixed state of b and its target pure state , can be attained , while keeping the maximal fidelity , by a finite number of measurements on a ( an  optimal purification \" ) .",
    "this constitutes a remarkable contrast to the standard purification protocol @xcite , in which it is generally difficult to realize both a non - vanishing yield and the maximal fidelity at the same time .",
    "since an entangled state is one of the pure states of two quantum systems , say a and b , one can think of a possibility of extracting the entangled state between a and b by repeatedly performing measurements on x which interacts with both a and b. this possibility has already been pointed out @xcite and explored to show that one of the bell states can be extracted when this mechanism is applied to a three - qubit system , where qubits a and b always interact with the other qubit x on which one and the same measurement is repeatedly performed .",
    "notice that in this case the two systems a and b are not spatially separated , because they are supposed to locally interact with x. on the other hand , it is often required , e.g. , in the ideas of quantum teleportation and communication @xcite , to establish an entanglement between two quantum systems that are located at or at least can be sent , without loosing the entanglement , to distant places . in this respect , it would be worth remembering that interesting ideas of generating an entanglement between two cavities @xcite and of transferring an entanglement between two modes in a cavity to that between other two modes in different cavities @xcite have been proposed . in the former a two - level atom",
    "is sent to interact successively with the two cavities resulting in the generation of an entanglement between the two , and in the latter the entanglement is shown to be transferred by a two - level atom which passes through the two cavities and interacts with the relevant cavity modes . in this paper , this kind of successive interaction with two quantum systems is incorporated within the framework of the new purification mechanism @xcite to show that an entanglement can be established between the states of the two systems spatially separated ( or that can be separated ) .",
    "notice that the entangled state is distilled from an arbitrary initial state that is in general mixed , while in the generation of entanglement in ref .",
    "@xcite the initial state should be prepared in an appropriate pure state and in the transfer of entanglement in ref .",
    "@xcite the state is assumed to be initially entangled .",
    "after a brief review of the new purification mechanism in sec .",
    "[ sec : rev ] , a scheme of successive interaction is introduced in a three - qubit system , a+b+x , in which system x is assumed to interact first with system a and then with b , in sec .",
    "[ sec : qqx ] .",
    "system x is prepared in an initial pure state and is measured after it has interacted with a and b. then only those events in which system x is found in the initial state are kept .",
    "this process will be repeated many times .",
    "it is shown that an optimal entanglement purification is actually realizable for a particular choice of interaction and by properly adjusting interaction times and strengths between a and x and b and x. in sec .  [",
    "sec : ccx ] , another example of an entanglement purification is examined in a physical system where a two - level atom x is injected successively to the two cavities a and b `` back and forth , '' interacts with their cavity modes under the rotating - wave approximation and the state of x is repeatedly measured in a prescribed way .",
    "it is explicitly shown that , under certain conditions , a particular entangled state between the lowest two modes of each cavity is extracted , irrespectively of the initial cavity states .",
    "finally we summarize the results obtained and give future perspectives in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "let the total system consist of two parts , system a and system b , and the dynamics be described by the total hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 stands for the interaction between the two ( sub)systems .",
    "we initially prepare the system in a product state @xmath2 at @xmath3 . notice that system b can be in an _ arbitrary mixed",
    "_ state @xmath4 .",
    "we perform measurements on a at regular intervals @xmath5 to confirm that it is still in the state @xmath6 @xcite , while the total system a+b during the time @xmath5 evolves unitarily in terms of the total hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "since the measurement is performed only on system a , the action of such a ( projective , for simplicity ) measurement can be conveniently described by the following projection operator @xmath8 thus the state of system a is set back to @xmath6 every after @xmath5 , while that of b just evolves dynamically on the basis of the total hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "we repeat the same measurement , represented by ( [ eq : calo ] ) , @xmath9 times and collect only those events in which system a has been found in the state @xmath6 consecutively @xmath9 times ; other events are discarded .",
    "the state of system b is then described by the density matrix @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an operator acting on b and @xmath12\\nonumber\\\\ & = { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}_\\text{b}\\bigl[\\bigl(v_\\phi(\\tau)\\bigr)^n\\rho_\\text{b}(0 )    \\bigl(v_\\phi^\\dagger(\\tau)\\bigr)^n\\bigr ] \\label{eq : ptaun}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the probability for these events to occur ( yield ) .",
    "this normalization factor appearing in ( [ eq : rhobn ] ) reflects the fact that only the right outcomes are collected in this process .    in order to examine the asymptotic state of system b for large @xmath9 ,",
    "consider , assuming its existence , the spectral decomposition of the operator @xmath13 , which is not hermitian , @xmath14 .",
    "we therefore need to set up both the right- and left - eigenvalue problems @xmath15 the eigenvalue @xmath16 is complex valued in general , but its absolute value is bounded @xcite @xmath17 this reflects the unitarity of the time evolution operator @xmath18 .",
    "these eigenvectors are assumed to form a complete orthonormal set in the following sense @xmath19 ( we normalize @xmath20 as @xmath21 , while the norm of @xmath22 has been fixed by the above relations and is not necessarily unity . )",
    "the operator @xmath13 itself is now expanded in terms of these eigenvectors @xmath23 it is now easy to see that the @xmath9th power of this operator is expressed as @xmath24 and therefore it is dominated by a single term for large @xmath9 @xmath25 provided the largest ( in magnitude ) eigenvalue @xmath26 is _ discrete , nondegenerate and unique_. if these conditions are satisfied , the density operator of system b is driven to a pure state @xmath27 with the probability @xmath28 the pure state @xmath29 , which is nothing but the right - eigenvector of the operator @xmath13 belonging to the largest ( in magnitude ) eigenvalue @xmath26 , is thus distilled in system b. this is the purification scheme proposed in @xcite .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "first , the final pure state @xmath29 toward which system b is to be driven is dependent on the choice of the state @xmath6 on which system a is projected every after measurement , on the measurement interval @xmath5 and the hamiltonian @xmath7 , but does not depend on the initial state of system b at all . in this sense , the purification is accomplished irrespectively of the initial ( mixed ) state @xmath4 .",
    "second , as is clear in the above exposition , what is crucial in this purification scheme is the repetition of one and the same measurement ( more appropriately , spectral decomposition ) and the measurement interval @xmath5 need not be very small @xcite .",
    "it instead remains an adjustable parameter .",
    "third , if we can make other eigenvalues than @xmath26 much smaller in magnitude @xmath30 by adjusting parameters , we will need fewer steps ( i.e. , smaller @xmath9 ) to purify system b.    it is now evident that the purification can be made _ optimal _ , if the conditions ( [ eq : quick ] ) and @xmath31 are satisfied .",
    "this condition ( [ eq : noloss ] ) assures that we can repeat as many measurements as we wish without running the risk of losing the yield @xmath32 in order to make the fidelity to the target state @xmath29 , @xmath33 , \\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] higher .",
    "actually , the yield @xmath32 decays like @xmath34 and the condition ( [ eq : noloss ] ) can bring us with the non - vanishing yield @xmath35 even in the @xmath36 limit .",
    "therefore the condition ( [ eq : noloss ] ) makes the two ( sometimes not compatible ) demands , i.e. , _ higher fidelity and non - vanishing yield _ , achievable , with fewer steps when the condition ( [ eq : quick ] ) is met . in this sense ,",
    "the purification is considered to be optimal",
    ".    it would be desirable if an optimal purification can be realized by an appropriate choice of the state @xmath6 and/or tuning of the measurement interval @xmath5 and parameters in a given hamiltonian .",
    "a few simple systems have already been examined @xcite to show how such optimal purifications are made possible .",
    "since an entangled state of system a+b is one of the pure states , there is a possibility that we apply the purification mechanism described above to distill the initial ( generally mixed ) state of a+b to a desired entangled state .",
    "this possibility has already been pointed out and it has been explicitly demonstrated that one of the bell states @xmath37 of the two qubit systems a+b can actually be extracted if we repeatedly measure one and the same state of another qubit system x , the interactions of which are symmetrical with respect to  a and b , resulting with the maximal yield @xcite .",
    "one of the limitations of this model is that the entanglement can be established only when the two systems a and b locally interact with the same system x at the same time and therefore it does not seem to allow to establish an entanglement between two systems that are spatially separated .",
    "a new scheme is certainly needed .    when the two systems a and b are spatially separated , their local interactions with the other system x can not take place simultaneously .",
    "this means that the interactions are considered to become effective one by one , i.e. , system x first interacts with , say system a and then with b @xcite .",
    "this kind of process can be conveniently described by a time - dependent total hamiltonian . in this section , a total system composed of three qubits ( or three spin @xmath38 systems ) , a , b , and x ,",
    "is considered .",
    "the two qubits a and b interact with the other qubit x successively , the state of x , initially prepared in a particular state , say in up state , is measured after the interactions with a and b , and only those events in which the state of x is found in up state will be retained and other events are just discarded .",
    "the process will be repeated many times and we are interested in the resulting state of a+b .",
    "assume that the three - qubit system a+b+x is described by a time - dependent total hamiltonian @xmath39 .",
    "qubit x , which is initially prepared in up state @xmath40 , is first brought to interaction with qubit a for time interval @xmath41 .",
    "the hamiltonian in this period is    @xmath42    next , after a free time evolution under the free hamiltonian @xmath43 for time duration @xmath44 , qubit x interacts with another qubit b , which has no direct interaction with a , for @xmath45 .",
    "the hamiltonian for this period reads @xmath46    after another free time evolution for @xmath47 , the state of x is measured and only those cases in which qubit x is found in its initial up state @xmath40 shall be retained .",

    "for example , we may consider the following preparation procedure , which is nothing but a purification process applied to cavity b. we send a two - level atom prepared in down state @xmath120 to cavity b. after its interaction , which is again assumed to be of the form ( [ eq : hab ] ) , with b , the atom is measured and only those events in which it is found in the state @xmath120 are retained .",
    "this process is to be repeated many times and the resulting state of a+b , which will be used as the initial state for the following entanglement distillation process ( [ eq : wp2 ] ) , would be dominated by the state @xmath161 , since the vacuum state of system b is the unique eigenstate of the relevant evolution operator @xmath162 belonging to eigenvalue unity if no fine tunings are made on the parameters . after having prepared the state @xmath105 , we repeat the process ( [ eq : wp2 ] ) under the condition ( [ eq : ccond ] )",
    ". we would finally end up with the single entangled state @xmath163 , because our initial state @xmath105 satisfies @xmath164 for @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the left - eigenstate corresponding to @xmath160 .    concluding this section we wish to give typical values of relevant parameters under the aspect of the possibility of implementing our proposal in laboratory .",
    "we concentrate on the estimation of the total duration @xmath167 of the experiment . to this end",
    ", we choose to be in the context of microwave cqed where both the geometrical arrangement of the experimental set up and the intensity of the atom - field coupling regime , seem more favorable to our proposal .",
    "let us first note that the typical atom - field coupling constant @xmath83 ( @xmath51 or @xmath52 ) can be chosen in such a way that @xmath168@xmath169 @xcite .",
    "moreover the lifetime of a rydberg atom is @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "as for the quality factor @xmath171 of the cavities currently used in laboratory , we quote typical values of the order of @xmath172@xmath173 @xcite corresponding to a cavity damping time @xmath174@xmath175 . considering that in our case @xmath176 , the total duration @xmath167 of the experiment may be estimated and turns out to be compatible with the entanglement distillation proposed in this section .",
    "in this paper , the idea of extracting entangled states among systems located at spatially separated places , irrespectively of their initial states , has been proposed and applied to simple systems to show the potentiality of a novel measurement - based purification scheme @xcite .",
    "the establishment of entanglement distillation relies on the successive interactions between the systems under consideration and the so - called  mediator \" quantum system . in the first example",
    ", it is demonstrated that the entanglement between the two qubit states is possible via their interactions with another qubit , which plays the role of the entanglement mediator , with the maximal yield ( optimal distillation ) . in the case of distillation of cavity - mode entanglement , however , a modification of the original simple scheme , that is , `` interaction @xmath121 measurement @xmath121 interaction @xmath177 , '' is required and the modified procedure ( [ eq : wp2 ] ) turns out to result in the entangled state @xmath163 , after an appropriate preparation of the initial state .",
    "we stress that there would also be a possibility of obtaining an entangled state not only in the lowest sector @xmath178 but also in the higher @xmath158 sector , provided an appropriate initial state be prepared",
    ".    it would be worth stressing that in spite of such a modification required in the second example , the underlying notion is still the same : the action of a measurement ( represented by a projection operator , for simplicity ) causes an essential and critical dynamical change , not only in the system measured , but also in the others interacting with the former . since the notion is so general , one can devise various applications of this scheme in many different situations .",
    "the examples explored in this paper are just two of them and further applications will be reported elsewhere .    finally we add some comments on the practical setup of our proposal . in both schemes reported in the previous sections ,",
    "the entanglement mediator is an atom appropriately prepared before entering in interaction with the two subsystems to be entangled and subjected to a conditional measurement of its internal state at the end of the two successive coupling processes .",
    "we wish to stress that to realize in practice the required `` many crosses '' scheme one may synchronize the injection of the @xmath179th atom of the sequence into the process with the successful outcome of the internal state measurement of the @xmath180th one .",
    "this kind of experimental setup might be preferable to the conceptually simpler one based on the idea of using always the same atom reversing its direction of motion at exit to re - inject it into the process .",
    "thus the representations in figs .  1 and 2 , as far as the aspect under scrutiny is concerned ,",
    "have been reported only for the sake of simplicity .",

    ", let us consider the determinant @xmath185 ( @xmath186 ) defined by @xmath187 it is easy to see that the particular form of @xmath185 and the definitions of @xmath188 and @xmath189 in ( [ a : cjdj ] ) lead to a recursion relation @xmath190 for @xmath191 .",
    "this is further reduced to @xmath192 if we set @xmath193 , then @xmath194 is found to be positive semi - definite and to satisfy @xmath195 this relation is easily solved to yield the explicit form of @xmath196 with      since each term in ( [ a : pk ] ) has the same sign to each other , vanishing of @xmath198 , which is nothing but the condition for the matrix ( [ a : matrix ] ) to possess eigenstates that belong to eigenvalue unity , is equivalent to that of each term .",
    "this means that there are @xmath158 conditions for three parameters @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath158 and it seems impossible to have a vanishing @xmath198 in general , unless most of the conditions are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "if we choose a particular value for @xmath199 , say @xmath201 as in ( [ eq : ccond ] ) , however , all @xmath198 with @xmath202 vanish because each term in ( [ a : pk ] ) contains either @xmath203 or @xmath204 , each of which vanishes .",
    "on the other hand , the matrix ( [ a : matrix ] ) is shown to have no eigenstate belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath62 .",
    "consider the following determinant @xmath205 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are again given in ( [ a : cjdj ] ) .",
    "since @xmath206 and therefore @xmath207 and @xmath208 , let us assume that all @xmath209 s are positive definite for @xmath210 up to @xmath211 .",
    "then it follows that @xmath212\\\\ > { } & c_ij_{i-1}-d_i^2j_{i-2}\\nonumber\\displaybreak[0]\\\\ = { } & \\sin^2\\varphi_\\text{a}^{(i)}\\cos^2\\varphi_\\text{b}^{(k - i+1)}\\nonumber\\\\   & { } \\times   \\bigl (   j_{i-1}-\\cos^2\\varphi_\\text{a}^{(i-1)}\\sin^2\\varphi_\\text{b}^{(k - i+1)}j_{i-2 }   \\bigr)\\nonumber\\\\ & { } + \\cos^2\\varphi_\\text{a}^{(i)}\\sin^2\\varphi_\\text{b}^{(k - i)}j_{i-1}. \\label{a : irr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this relation recursively yields inequalities @xmath213 the last factor on the right most hand is shown to be positive definite @xmath214 which means that the quantity on the left - hand side in ( [ a : irr1 ] ) is positive definite .",
    "we conclude that @xmath215 is positive definite and therefore @xmath216 does not vanish , which completes the proof .",
