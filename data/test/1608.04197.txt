    "it is a robust 2d membrane with unique and tunable material properties that can be exploited in micro- and nanoscale metamaterials .",
    "while the electronic properties of graphene are well understood , the continuum mechanical behavior remains a frontier of research .",
    "in particular , experimental studies on graphene , along with previous theory @xcite , indicate that thermal effects _ dramatically modify _ the mechanical properties of the membrane . here",
    "we study how the interplay between thermal effects and boundary conditions , as well as geometry , affect the measured mechanical properties of graphene sheets .",
    "the extended translational order typical of crystals can be unstable to thermal fluctuations , and the situation is even more precarious when the crystalline sheet is a membrane free to fluctuate in the third dimension .",
    "although thermal fluctuations will eventually decorrelate long range order in the membrane normals in liquid membranes ( such as lipid bilayers ) , for crystalline membranes the nonlinear coupling of height fluctuations to in - plane phonon deformations leads to a length - scale dependent stiffening of the microscopic bending rigidity at long length scales .    to emphasize the remarkable nature of the ordered phase of crystalline membranes note",
    "that if one views the local normals as classical vector spins then one would expect the model to be disordered in the same way as the 2d - heisenberg model of magnetism , a consequence of the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem .",
    "a crystalline membrane differs from the heisenberg model , however , in several crucial ways .",
    "first of all , the  spins \" are constrained because they must be strictly normal to a continuous underlying membrane surface .",
    "such constraints , intimately connected with the existence of an in - plane shear modulus , change the available configuration space and consequently alter the statistical mechanical behavior of the system , including the phase diagram itself . in a perturbative field theory treatment , these constraints lead to the nonlinear coupling of in - plane phonons to height that renormalize the bending rigidity so that it flows with length scale ( or wavevector ) rather than being a fixed material parameter at long wavelengths .",
    "height fluctuations inevitably cost elastic energy because the two planar phonon degrees of freedom can not compensate for the three degrees of freedom in the symmetric 2d strain tensor associated with an arbitrary height deformation .",
    "the result is long - range flatness of the thermally stiffened membrane or , equivalently , long - range order in the normal - normal correlation function describing the spatial correlations of local normals to pieces of the membrane .",
    "while these effects have been studied theoretically suitable experimental systems have been more difficult to find .",
    "one might expect that thermal fluctuations of a membrane would only be important for extremely soft systems such as the spectrin cytoskeletal network of the red blood cell @xcite , spherical assemblies of spider silk proteins @xcite or polymersomes @xcite . even here",
    ", however , the bending rigidity is typically much larger than the temperature at which such systems are stable and the corresponding length scales at which thermal fluctuations are important can be dozens of particle spacings or more .",
    "graphene , however , has a very large young s modulus @xmath9 ( order @xmath10 ) , but a relatively modest microscopic bending rigidity @xmath11ev .",
    "corrections to the microscopic bending rigidity @xmath12 due to thermal ripples for a fluctuating crystalline membrane are described by a scale - dependent bending rigidity of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a wavevector , @xmath15 is a momentum integral that scales as @xmath16 when @xmath17 , or equivalently as @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being a long wavelength cutoff provided by the system size @xmath19 and @xmath9 the 2d young modulus @xcite .",
    "one readily sees that corrections to the bare bending rigidity are of order the bare rigidity itself for @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "remarkably , for graphene at room temperature this thermal length scale is extremely small , @xmath22 , comparable to the spacing between carbon atoms .",
    "the high in - plane elastic modulus of this covalently bonded material thus leads to significant thermal stiffening of the bending rigidity even at microscopic length scales !",
    "this shape stiffening is essential for stabilizing graphene as a 2d , approximately planar , crystal against the thermal fluctuations that often entropically dominate 2d systems with continuous symmetry",
    ". one should contrast covalently bonded sheets of graphene ( or mo@xmath23 ) with _ soft _ matter , where the much lower young moduli mean that thermal fluctuations become strong only for larger length scales .",
    "the correction to the bending rigidity , in units of @xmath24 , is proportional to @xmath25 , the dimensionless fppl - von krmn number measuring the ratio of typical elastic deformation energies to bending energies @xcite .",
    "large values of @xmath26 , even in the _ absence _ of thermal fluctuations , lead to the notoriously difficult problems of thin plates and shells , important for understanding the strength of macroscopic objects such as domed sports arenas and submarines @xcite . for an @xmath27 square graphene sheet",
    ", we have @xmath28 , a number which can also be obtained by extrapolating the continuum elastic theory of thin plates of thickness h as @xmath29 @xcite for atomically thin graphene with @xmath30 . to appreciate the enormous size of @xmath26 in graphene ,",
    "it is helpful to recall that the deformations involved in crumpling an ordinary piece of paper  only \" involve @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath26 number in the thin limit is a predominantly geometric quantity determined by the aspect ratio of the material .",
    "very large @xmath26 numbers naively mean that bending should be a soft mode compared to elastic deformations . here",
    ", however , the nonlinear coupling of height fluctuations to in - sheet phonons thermally stiffens the bending rigidity over scales larger than the microscopic mesh size and consequently stabilizes the extended crystalline sheet flat phase of graphene .",
