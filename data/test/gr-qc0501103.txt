    "exact solutions of einstein s field equations with axial symmetry play an important role in the astrophysical applications of general relativity , since the natural shape of an isolated self - gravitating fluid is axially symmetric . in particular , disk - like configurations of matter",
    "are of great interest , since they can be used as models of galaxies and accretion disks .",
    "solutions for static thin disks without radial pressure were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite , and morgan and morgan @xcite , and with radial pressure by morgan and morgan @xcite .",
    "several classes of exact solutions of the einstein field equations corresponding to static thin disks with or without radial pressure have been obtained by different authors @xcite-@xcite .",

    "the nonlinear superposition of a disk and a black hole was first obtained by lemos and letelier @xcite .",
    "perfect fluid disks with halos @xcite and charged perfect fluid disks @xcite were also studied . for a survey on self gravitating relativistic thin disks ,",
    "see for instance @xcite .    in the works cited above an inverse style method was used to solve the einstein equations , i.  e. , the energy - momentum tensor is computed from the metric representing the disk . another approach to generate disks is by solving the einstein equations given a source ( energy - momentum tensor ) .",
    "this has been used by the jena group to generate several exact solutions of disks @xcite-@xcite .    even though in a first approximation thin disks can be used as usefull models of galaxies , in a more realistic model the thickness of the disk should be considered .",
    "the addition of a new dimension may change the dynamical properties of the disk source , e.  g. , its stability .",
    "thick static relativistic disks in various coordinate systems were presented in @xcite .",
    "the method used to construct the thick disks is a generalization of the well known `` displace , cut and reflect '' method used to generate thin disks from vacuum solutions of einstein equations .",

    "it can be divided in the following steps ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) : first , choose a surface ( usually the @xmath0 plane ) that divides the usual space in two parts : one with no singularities or sources , and the other with singularities .",
    "second , disregard the part of the space with singularities .",
    "third , put a thick shell below the surface .",
    "fourth , use the bottom surface of the shell to make an inversion of the nonsingular part of the space .",
    "the result will be a disk of infinite extension and thickness twice of the shell . in the original method the surface that divides the space",
    "is used to make an inversion , resulting in a space with a singularity that is a delta distribution with support on @xmath0 . because of the additional step , the modification can be named `` displace , cut , fill and reflect '' method .",
