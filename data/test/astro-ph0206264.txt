    "the cosmic baryon budget at low and high redshift indicates that a large fraction of baryons in the local universe have so far escaped detection ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while there is clear evidence that a significant fraction of these `` missing baryons '' ( between 20 - 40% of total baryons ) lie in photoionized , low - redshift ly@xmath0 clouds @xcite , the remainder could be located in intergalactic space with temperatures of @xmath8 k ( warm - hot intergalactic medium , or whim ) .",
    "resonant absorption from highly - ionized ions located in the whim gas has been predicted based on both analytic studies of structure formation and evolution ( @xcite ) and cosmic hydrodynamic simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent discovery of absorption lines by the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) and the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ) ( @xcite ) indicates that there may be a significant reservoir of baryons in absorbers . while li - like probes about @xmath9 of the whim gas ( @xcite ) , the remaining @xmath10 is hotter and can only be probed by ions with higher ionization potentials , such as h- and he - like oxygen .",
    "the whim gas , predicted by hydrodynamic simulations , typically has an overdensity of @xmath11 and is distributed in small groups of galaxies or in large scale filamentary structures that connect virialized halos .",
    "given the expected physical conditions , current instruments such as _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ should be capable of detecting resonance features from the whim gas @xcite . a first attempt by @xcite with the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) yielded an upper limit of @xmath12 .",
    "recently , with the _ chandra _ letgs - hrc , @xcite discovered x - ray resonant absorption features from warm / hot local gas along the line of sight towards pks  2155 - 304 , giving the first x - ray evidence for possible whim gas .",
    "these absorbers are near zero redshift and therefore most likely associated with the galaxy or local group ( see   2 ) .",
    "we report the first detection of an ly@xmath0 absorption line along the sightline towards pks  2155 - 304 at @xmath13 plausibly associated with an _ intervening _ , modestly overdense region in the igm .",
    "the observations were made with the _ chandra _ letg - acis ( advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ) .",
    "physical diagnostics show the gas that gives rise to this resonance line has the typical properties of the whim , indicating the detection of a significant fraction of the `` missing baryons '' .",
    "pks  2155 - 304 at @xmath14 @xcite is one of the brightest soft x - ray sources ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and has been used as a _",
    "chandra _ calibration target .",
    "it was observed with the _ chandra _ letg - acis ( see , e.g. , _ chandra _ proposers observatory guide at http://asc.harvard.edu/ ) on may 31 , 2000 , december 6 , 2000 and november 31 , 2001 .",
    "we restrict all spectra to the range 242 @xmath15 to avoid complexities at longer wavelengths from the instrumental c - k edge .",
    "the events were summed in 0.025@xmath15 bins , half of the instrumental line response function , which has nearly constant fwhm @xmath16   across its bandpass ( for data processing procedures , see @xcite ) .",
    "we corrected the wavelength scale by calibrating the spectrum with two known features ( atomic from the galaxy and solid - state from the instruments ) .",
    "the three data sets were separately divided by the best fit galactic absorbed power - law to remove the underlying broad - band continuum behavior .",
    "the remaining residuals were then fit with a five - order polynomial .",
    "such a technique removes spectral features larger than @xmath17 ( e.g. 5 - 10% calibration uncertainties ) but preserves narrow line features .",
    "the data from the three observations were then combined as a weighted sum that accounts for the differences in exposures and effective area .",
    "the observation during november 2001 has the strongest soft flux ( respectively for may 2000 , december 2000 and november 2001 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "all continua are well described by a single power law ( @xmath19 ,  and  @xmath20 , respectively ) absorbed by a galactic hydrogen column of @xmath21 @xcite ( errors are quoted at 90% confidence ) .",
    "after a blind search for any statistically significant absorption features , two absorption features with s / n  @xmath22  4 were detected in the 242   region of the letgs spectral bandpass ( figure  1 ) .",
    "these features were subsequently fit in isis ( interactive spectral interpretation system : http://space.mit.edu/asc/isis/ ) with gaussian models ( table  1 ) .",
    "the absorption feature at @xmath23   was reported by @xcite in the letgs - hrc archival data , which they attribute to  he@xmath0 resonance absorption from warm / hot local gas .",
    "we also show in table  1 our results for two other features claimed by @xcite .",
    "the feature attributed to  ly@xmath0 is marginally detected ( @xmath24 ) while  he@xmath25 is not significant ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we defer the discussion of these three features to a later paper , noting only that they are at @xmath27 and therefore probably associated with the galaxy or local group .",
    "we searched for the 20  feature in the letg - hrc data of this source , but find that this region is complicated by instrumental feature(s ) that we also found in the letg - hrc observations of 3c  273 .",
    "we concentrate on the absorption feature which appears at @xmath29 ( 619  ev ) .",
    "this falls at about the same energy where @xcite detected a broad ( @xmath7 50 - 100 ev ) absorption feature from an observation with the _ einstein observatory _ objective grating spectrometer .",
    "a similar broad feature was detected by @xcite .",
    "however , the line we detect is unresolved and has a width of @xmath30 ( or 1.2 ev ) at 90% confidence .",
    "the poisson significance of that this feature is due to a chance fluctuation is @xmath31 , equivalent to @xmath1 for gaussian statistics .",
    "the probability of finding one such feature by chance in the 1520 bins from 240   is 0.35% .",
    "the 21.61   feature has a similar confidence level , while the next most prominent feature has 20% probability of occuring by chance ( these values were confirmed using monte carlo simulations ) .",
    "considering cosmic abundances and oscillator strengths ( e.g. @xcite ) for different ions , ly@xmath0 is the only strong candidate line between 18 and 20   , the measured wavelength de - redshifted to the source .",
    "one scenario which may reconcile ly@xmath0 at @xmath32 with the @xmath33   of the detected feature is that this is the signature of a high velocity @xmath34 wind / jet blueshifted from the bl lac rest frame . in this case",
    "the narrowness of the line would be surprising , especially when compared to the very broad ( @xmath35 ) feature seen by @xcite and @xcite , although we note that the relativistic jet in the galactic binary ss433 does have roughly constant velocity @xcite",
    ". the implied mass outflow would be hundreds to thousands of @xmath36 , depending on assumptions about ionization conditions and beaming factors , as shown in @xcite .",
    "they also discuss some of the resulting difficulties with such an outflow .",
    "it is more plausible that the 20    absorption is due to ly@xmath0 in a known intervening system at @xmath37 . with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , @xcite discovered a cluster of low metallicity ly@xmath0 clouds along the line - of - sight ( los ) towards pks  2155 - 304 , most of which have redshift between @xmath38 and @xmath39 . using 21 cm images from the _ very large array _ ( _ vla _ ) , they detected a small group of four galaxies offset by @xmath40 kpc , and a standard @xmath41cdm model with @xmath42 and @xmath43 throughout the paper . ] from the los , and suggested that the ly@xmath0 clouds could arise from gas associated with the group .",
    "the velocity centroid of the four galaxies is @xmath44 , which within the uncertainties is identical to that of our absorption feature .",
    "therefore the hot gas giving rise to the absorption can plausibly be associated with the same overdensity indicated by the ly@xmath0 absorbers and the small galaxy group .",
    "taking the absorption line to be ly@xmath0 , the doppler @xmath45-parameter must be @xmath46 ( 90% confidence ) since the line is unresolved .",
    "if @xmath47 , then the line is unsaturated and @xmath48 . at @xmath49",
    "the line is heavily saturated , but this can be ruled out by the lack of higher lyman series lines in our spectrum . associating the absorber with the galaxy group detected by @xcite , which has a radial velocity dispersion of @xmath50 , suggests that the unsaturated case is most appropriate , and we adopt that for the subsequent discussion .",
    "however , simulations assuming complete viralization of the hot gas predict @xmath49 for lines such as this one @xcite , so saturation can not be ruled out .      we can constrain the density of the absorbing gas , assuming",
    "it is associated with the intervening galaxy group .",
    "first , the upper limit on the line width of @xmath51 sets an upper limit to the path length of @xmath52 , since otherwise the differential hubble flow would excessively broaden the line . for @xmath48 ,",
    "this gives @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the metallicity in units of 0.1 solar abundance , @xmath55 is the ionization fraction in units of 0.5 and @xmath56 is the path length in units of @xmath57 .",
    "we adopt a metallicity of @xmath58 @xcite , which is the mean value predicted from hydrodynamic simulations for overdensities of @xmath7 30 , with a dispersion of a factor of two @xcite .",
    "a more reasonable estimate of the path length comes from the mean projected separation of @xmath71 mpc for the galaxies in the group @xcite , which gives @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , this could be taken as a plausible upper limit , since the whim associated with this overdensity could well be more extended than the galaxies , as are the ly@xmath0 clouds .",
    "this implies a range of baryon overdensity over the cosmic mean @xmath60 @xcite of @xmath61 50 - 350 .",
    "interestingly , @xcite estimate an overdensity for the galaxy group of @xmath62100 .    in the case of pure collisional ionization",
    ", temperature is the only parameter of importance over a wide range of density so long as the gas is optically thin . the ionization fraction peaks at 0.5 , and exceeds 0.1 for temperatures @xmath63 k. using cloudy @xcite we find that photoionzation by the cosmic uv / x - ray background is not important for @xmath64 .",
    "we can compare this estimate for t to what we might expect from the dynamics of the group of galaxies , if it forms a bound system .",
    "then its virial mass is @xmath65 .",
    "scaling the mass - temperature relationship down from richer clusters of galaxies @xcite , gives a temperature of @xmath66 k. similarly , using the relation between velocity dispersion and temperature obtained from fitting a sample of galaxy groups gives a value of @xmath67 k @xcite .",
    "these values are somewhat higher than what we find from the ionization fraction .",
    "this could suggest that the system is not bound and virialized .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that the intragroup gas in spiral - rich groups , such as this one , may be cooler than that of groups and clusters of early - type galaxies .",
    "they suggested that these cooler systems may imprint absorption lines from highly - ionized species ( e.g. ) on quasar spectra , which may be what we observe .",
    "cloudy calculations of the column density ratios between other ions and give another tight constraint on gas temperature . based on the non - detection of other ion species ,",
    "we calculate the @xmath68 upper limits of the column densities of h- and he - like c , n , ne and he - like oxygen relative to .",
    "n(o  vii)/n(o  viii ) provide the strongest constraints on gas temperature . at roughly @xmath69 k , all the column density ratios satisfy the observed constraints .    adopting the value of @xmath70",
    "k , we can compare the cooling timescale for the gas to the hubble time @xmath71 .",
    "the cooling time scale @xmath72 , here @xmath73 is the cooling function @xcite , which is a function of temperature and metallicity ( in the temperature range of interest , line emission from iron is the most effective coolant ) . for 0.1@xmath74 ,",
    "the baryon density should be @xmath75 so that the gas remains hot .",
    "this density limit , however , would be lower by a factor of @xmath76 if the abundance is solar .",
    "alternatively , we can use the cooling argument to set an upper limit on the metallicity . adopting a baryon density of @xmath77 and requiring @xmath78",
    ", the cooling function @xmath41 must be less than @xmath79 , which implies a metallicity of @xmath80 .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite we estimate the baryonic content @xmath81 that can be probed by our resonance absorption line , expressed in units of @xmath82 .",
    "we assume conservative upper limits of @xmath83 and ionization fraction of @xmath84 . given the path length of @xmath85 , we estimate @xmath86 .",
    "this is about 10% of the total baryon fraction , or about 30 - 40% of the whim gas , if the whim gas contains about 30 - 40% of total baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "this baryon fraction is consistent with the prediction from @xcite based on a simple analytic model ; however , these numbers are very rough estimates , due to the large uncertainties in the abundance and ionization fraction .",
    "our detection of ly@xmath0 from an intervening overdense region in the igm at @xmath87 , together with the detection by @xcite of absorption from systems at @xmath88 associated with the galaxy or local group , have begun to reveal the much - anticipated warm - hot component of intergalactic matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ly@xmath0 feature we observe is plausibly associated with the same cosmic overdensity that gives rise to the ly@xmath0 clouds and the four spiral galaxies found by @xcite .",
    "three of the galaxies have radial velocities within @xmath89 of one another , while the fourth is within @xmath90 .",
    "in contrast , the velocities of the 1 ly@xmath0 clouds span @xmath91 , with two falling very close to the velocities of the closest projected galaxies .",
    "the galaxies represent an overdensity of @xmath3 relative to the mean .",
    "our estimates for the overdensity of the hot absorbing gas are @xmath6150 - 350 .",
    "the ly@xmath0 clouds have very low metallicity , indicating that they are primarily composed of primordial material , whereas the hot gas should have an oxygen abundance of @xmath92 solar to give sensible values for the column density .",
    "it is unlikely that the same gas is responsible for both and absorption .",
    "following @xcite , we identify this as a region of modest overdensity ( the galaxy group ) connected to filamentary or sheet - like structures demarcated by the ly@xmath0 clouds , such as those seen in numerous cosmological simulations .",
    "we note that the detection of a system such as this is roughly consistent with previous simulations .",
    "based on the models of @xcite and @xcite , we estimate the cumulative absorption line number along a random sightline ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "we adopt the numerical relation between baryon overdensity and metallicity from @xcite and assume collisional ionization .",
    "this observation is @xmath93 above the predicted value at the measured column density . according to fig .  3",
    ", the probability of detecting such an ly@xmath0 line or stronger to @xmath94 is @xmath7 10% .",
    "the consistency , if borne out by further studies , suggests that the simulations are valid descriptors of the warm / hot component of the igm , at least for overdensities of @xmath7100 . using those simulations , we estimate that we can probe about 10% of total baryons and about 30 - 40% of the whim gas in the local universe",
    ".    other observations of bright agn with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ grating spectrometers are likely to reveal additional whim absorption features , and may turn the present few samplings into a real forest of high ionization ly@xmath0 or he@xmath0 lines .",
    "however , the sensitivity of these instruments permit us only to probe the high density tail of the distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it will be left to future missions like _ constellation - x _ and _ xeus _ , assuming they have both high throughput and spectral resolving powers of 1000 or more at energies 0.1 - 1 kev , to fully reveal the x - ray forest .",
