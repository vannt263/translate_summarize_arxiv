    "study of the mechanism of the particle number production is a very important issue in baryogenesis and leptogensis . in experiments , there are many phenomena which violate the particle number .",
    "such phenomena includes @xmath0 mixing and neutrino flavor oscillation .",
    "while they can be treated with time evolution of pure state , the baryogenesis and leptogenesis occur in the environment where the statistical treatment is suitable .",
    "this is because they occur when the definite particle number of the universe is unknown . in this study",
    ", we use the non - equilibrium field theory with the density matrix and study the time evolution of the particle number .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we propose a particle number violating model which consists of a heavy neutral scalar and one complex scalar . in the next section , the current associated with the particle number is written in terms of a green function of non - equilibrium field theory . in section iii ,",
    "the particle number production rate is computed and its property is discussed . the final section is devoted to conclusion .",
    "in the previous paper @xcite , we proposed the following model for particle number production with the interaction . & = & _ n ^n - n^2 + + & + & _",
    "^^- m_^2 ^ + a_n ^ + & + & b^2 ^2 + a n ^2 + h.c . , where @xmath1 is a real scalar and @xmath2 is a complex scalar .",
    "there are two types of the interaction .",
    "one is particle number conserving interaction which coefficient is given by @xmath3 and the other is particle number violating interaction with the coefficient @xmath4 .",
    "there are also two types of mass term .",
    "one of them with the coefficient @xmath5 violates the particle number and the other one is a particle number conserving one given by the mass term @xmath6 .",
    "one may take a phase convention that @xmath5 is real and @xmath4 is complex .",
    "we denote the phase a as @xmath7 and it is a source of cp violation .",
    "the mass term @xmath5 breaks u(1 ) symmetry and it splits one complex scalar fields into the two mass eigenstates of real scalars . introducing two real scalars as @xmath8 ,",
    "the lagrangian is rewritten as , & = & ( _ n ^n -m_n^2 n^2 ) + & + & _ i=1 ^ 2(__i ^_i -m_i^2 _ i^2)+ _",

    "@xmath10 is a two by two matrix and is given by , =     -|a| _ a & -|a|_a +    .",
    "the particle number associated with the complex field @xmath2 is a u(1 ) current .",
    "j_&=&i ( ^_-_^ ) + & = & _ 2 _ _ 1-__2 _ 1 .",
    "we compute the divergence of the u(1 ) current with some initial condition specified with the density matrix .",
    "j_(x ) = tr(j_(x ) ( 0 ) ) , [ eq : u1a ] where @xmath11 represents an initial quantum statistical state ; ( 0)=. @xmath12 is u(1 ) charge given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 is @xmath15 with the temperature @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is chemical potential .",
    "we assume that at @xmath18 all the interaction terms including u(1 ) breaking mass term are zero and @xmath19 , suddenly they are switched on .",
    "therefore at t=0 , hamiltonian @xmath20 and particle number @xmath12 commute as ; = 0 , [ eq : com ] and at later time @xmath19 , the u(1 ) breaking terms are switched on and the particle number is not conserved . 0 . in @xmath18 ,",
    "eq.([eq : com ] ) , the density matrix can be written by the following product , ( 0)=. with the property eq.([eq : com ] ) , one can write the density matrix even for non - zero chemical potential case . using the density matrix , the initial particle number at @xmath18 is given as , l(0 ) & & tr l(0 ) ( 0 ) + & = & . when chemical potential is zero ,",
    "the initial particle number is zero . in the following ,",
    "we use the density matrix of @xmath21 and focus on the particle number production with the interaction .",
    "@xmath22 current defined in eq.([eq : u1a ] ) can be written in terms of the green function of non - equilibrium field theory ; @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , g_12 ^ 12(x , y)&= & < _ 1(x ) ( 0 )",

    "the upper indices distinguish whether the operator is on the time ordered path @xmath24 or on anti - time ordered path @xmath25 in closed time path formulation @xcite .",
    "using the definition , the divergence of the averaged current with the density matrix is the production rate per unit time and unit volume .",
    "this can be related to the green function as follows , & & j^(x ) = ( _",
    "x-_y ) g^12_12(x , y)_x = y = x .",
    "+ if the space translation invariance holds , the current depends on only time . if this is the case , the divergence of the current is equal to time derivative of the particle number density , j^(x ) = j^0(x^0 ) . with the help of 2 pi ( two particle irreducible ) formulation of the non - equilibrium quantum field theory @xcite ,",
    "we derive schwinger dyson equation for the green functions in @xcite . the schwinger dyson equation can be solved perturbatively and the divergence of u(1 ) current obtained in one - loop level .",
    "we find , & & j^(x ) -4|a| _ a a _ + & & + & & \\{(n_k+1 ) n_n ( n_p+1)-n_k ( n_n+1 ) n_p } + & & \\{i(_2p+_2k-_n , x^0 ) + & & - i(_1p+_1k-_n , x^0 ) } .",
    "[ eq : prd ] where we have ignored the terms which is proportional to @xmath5 and @xmath26 .",

    "the first term implies the decay @xmath1 to two light scalars while the second term implies inverse decay . if the energy conservation in the following sense , holds , _",
    "k+_p=_n(p+k ) , [ eq : econv ] then , ( n_n+1 ) n_k n_p = n_n(n_k+1)(n_p+1 ) .",
    "the particle number production is cancelled between the decay process and inverse decay process .",
    "therefore the net particle number can not be produced if the energy conservation of eq.([eq : econv ] ) is satisfied .",
    "next we study the coupling constants in eq.([eq : prd ] ) .",
    "the production rate is proportional to cp violating phase @xmath31 .",
    "in addition to cp violation , both types of the interactions , one is cp conserving and particle number conserving one @xmath3 and the other is cp violating and particle number violating one @xmath4 are required .",
    "finally we study time dependence .",
    "we are interested in the time length for which coherence of the two amplitudes in eq.([eq : prd ] ) corresponding to the @xmath32 @xmath33 is not lost yet .",
    "when the coherence remains , one can use the approximation , & & i(_2p+_2k-_n , x^0)- i(_1p+_1k-_n , x^0 ) + & & \\{(+ ) x^0 } , where @xmath34 .",
    "we have used the approximation , _ 2k=&=&_k+ , + _ 1k=&=&_k- .",
    "we consider when @xmath35 is large and is proportional to @xmath36 . in the limit of small @xmath5 with fixed @xmath37 ,",
    "the time dependent factor becomes , & & i(_2p+_2k-_n , x^0)- i(_1p+_1k-_n , x^0 ) + & & ( _ 0 ) \\{(+ ) x^0}. substituting the time dependent factor , the divergence of the current is , & & j^(x ) -4|a| _ a a _ + & & ( _ n-_k-_p ) + & & \\{(n_k+1 ) n_n ( n_p+1)-n_k ( n_n+1 ) n_p } + & & \\{(+ ) x^0}. the presence of the delta function implies the energy conservation @xmath38 holds .",
    "therefore the decay contribution and inverse decay contribution are cancelled each other .",
    "below , we consider only the decay contribution .",
