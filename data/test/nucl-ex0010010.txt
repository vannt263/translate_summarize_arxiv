    "internal cluster target facilities  such as cosy-11  @xcite installed at the cooler synchrotron cosy - jlich  @xcite  permit the study of the production of mesons in the proton - proton interaction with high luminosity ( @xmath0  @xmath1 s@xmath2 ) in spite of very low target densities ( @xmath3  atoms  @xmath1 ) .",
    "such conditions minimize changes in the ejectiles momentum vectors due to secondary scattering in the target , and hence facilitate the precise study of reactions with cross section values at the nanobarn level .",
    "an exact extraction of absolute cross sections from the measured data demands a reliable estimation of the acceptance of the detection system .",
    "this in turn crucially depends on the accuracy of the determination of the position and dimensions of both the beam and the target . using the cosy11 detection system  @xcite as illustration",
    ", we will describe a method for estimating the dimensions of the proton beam , based on the momentum distribution for elastically scattered protons , which can be measured simultaneously with the investigated reaction .    at the cosy11 facility ( see fig .",
    "[ elas_princip ] ) the production of short - lived uncharged mesons ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 ) and hyperons ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) is investigated by means of the missing mass technique via the @xmath10 and @xmath11 reactions , respectively  @xcite . in this way , the four - momenta of positively charged particles are fully determined experimentally .",
    "the accuracy of the extracted missing mass value determines whether the signal from the given meson is visible over a background and depends on the precision of the momentum reconstruction of the registered protons or kaons .",
    "consequently , it varies with the detector resolution , the momentum spread and the geometrical spread of the accelerator proton beam interacting with the internal cluster target beam .",
    "the momentum reconstruction is performed by tracing back trajectories from drift chambers through the dipole magnetic field to the target  ( fig .",
    "[ elas_princip],@xcite ) , which is an infinitely thin vertical line in the ideal case . in reality , however , the reactions take place in a region of finite dimensions where the beam and the target overlap  ( see fig .  [ kolo_gaussy ] ) .",
    "assuming an infinitesimal target , our analysis shows a smearing out of the momentum vectors and hence of the resolution of the missing mass signal .",
    "however , if the target and beam dimensions are known it is possible to determine the average smearing of the missing mass originating from this effect and hence to infer for example the natural width of the measured mesons , provided that the beam momentum spread is known as well .",
    "part of the cosy11 detection setup used for the registration of elastically scattered protons is shown in figure  [ elas_princip ] .",
    "trajectories of protons scattered in the forward direction are measured by means of two drift chambers ( d1 and d2 ) and a scintillator hodoscope  ( s1 ) , whereas the recoil protons are registered in coincidence with the forward ones using a silicon pad detector arrangement ( si ) and a scintillation detector  ( s4 ) . the two  body kinematics gives an unambiguous relation between the scattering angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the recoil and forward protons ( see fig .",
    "[ elas_princip ] ) . therefore ,",
    "as seen in figure  [ correl ] , events of elastically scattered protons can be identified from the correlation line formed between the position in the silicon pad detector si , and the scintillator hodoscope s1 , the latter measured by the two drift chamber stacks . for those protons which are elastically scattered in the forward direction and deflected in the magnetic field of the dipole",
    ", the momentum vector at the target point can be determined .",
    "according to two ",
    "body kinematics , momentum components parallel and perpendicular to the beam axis form an ellipse .",
    "a section of this ellipse is shown as a solid line in figure  [ trans_paral]a superimposed on the data which were selected according to the correlation criterion from figure  [ correl ] for elastically scattered events .    in figures",
    "[ correl ] and figure  [ trans_paral]a , the elastically scattered events stand out clearly against a low level background . but",
    "more importantly the mean of the elastically scattered data is significantly shifted from the expected line , indicating that the reconstructed momenta are on average larger than expected .",
    "this discrepancy is difficult to explain in terms of the uncertainties of either the proton beam momentum or the proton beam angle .",
    "for instance , to account for this discrepancy , the beam momentum must be changed by more than 120  mev / c ( dashed line in figure  [ trans_paral]a ) , which is 40  times larger than the conservatively estimated error of the absolute beam momentum  ( @xmath14  3  mev / c )  @xcite . similarly , the effect could have been corrected by changing the beam angle by 40  mrad  ( see dotted line in figure  [ trans_paral]a ) , which exceeds the uncertainty of the beam angle  ( @xmath14  1  mrad  @xcite ) by at least a factor of  40 .",
    "a reasonable agreement is obtained , however , by shifting the assumed reaction point relative to the nominal value by @xmath15  cm perpendicular to the beam axis towards the center of the cosy  ring , along the x - axis defined in figure  [ elas_princip ] .",
    "the experimentally extracted momentum components obtained in this manner are shown in figure  [ trans_paral]b , together with the expectation depicted by the solid line .",
    "there is good agreement and the data are now spread symmetrically around the ellipse .",
    "this spread is essentially due to the finite extensions of the cluster target and the proton beam overlap ( about @xmath16  cm as inferred from the shift in the target position required ) .",
    "other contributions , including the spread of the beam momentum and still some multiple scattering events , appear to be negligible .",
    "we now consider in more detail the influence of the effective target dimensions and the spread of the cosy beam .",
    "we assume the target beam to be described by a cylindrical pipe , with a diameter of 9  mm , homogeneously filled with protons  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cosy proton beam density distribution is described by gaussian functions with standard deviations @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the horizontal and vertical directions ( see fig .",
    "[ kolo_gaussy ] ) , respectively  @xcite .",
    "carlo calculations are performed varying the distance between the target and the beam centres ( @xmath19 ) , and the horizontal proton beam extension ( @xmath17 ) .    in order to account for the angular distribution of the elastically scattered protons ,",
    "an appropriate weight @xmath20 was assigned to each generated event according to the differential distributions of the cross sections measured by the edda collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the generated events were analyzed in the same way as the experimental data .",
    "a comparison of the data from figure  [ trans_paral]a ( data analyzed using the nominal interaction point ) with the corresponding simulated histograms allows both @xmath17 and @xmath19 to be determined . for finding an estimate of the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath19",
    "we construct the @xmath21 statistic according to the _ method of least squares _ : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the content of the @xmath25 bin of the p@xmath26versus ",
    "p@xmath27 spectrum determined from experiment ( fig .  [ trans_paral]a ) and simulations , respectively .",
    "the background events @xmath28 in the i@xmath29 bin amount to less than one per cent of the data  @xcite and were estimated by linear interpolations between the inner and outer part of a broad distribution surrounding the expected ellipse originating from elastically scattered protons .",
    "the free parameter @xmath30 allows adjustment of the overall scale of the fitted monte ",
    "carlo histograms .",
    "thus , by varying the @xmath30 parameter , the @xmath31 for each pair of @xmath17 and @xmath19 was established as a minimum of the @xmath32 distribution .",
    "the results of the monte  carlo calculations are shown in figure  [ dx1_vs_sx1 ] .",
    "+ figure  [ dx1_vs_sx1]a shows the logarithm of @xmath31 as a function of the values of @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath31 function has a valley identifying a minimum and allowing the unique determination of the varied parameters  @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
    "the overall minimum of the @xmath33distribution , at @xmath17  =  0.2  cm and @xmath19  =  -  0.2  cm is more evident in figures  [ dx1_vs_sx1]b  and  [ dx1_vs_sx1]c , which show the projections of the valley line onto the respective axis .",
    "the same results were obtained when employing the poisson likelihood @xmath21 derived from the maximum likelihood method  @xcite @xmath34 , \\label{eqchi2_mh}\\ ] ] the vertical beam extension of @xmath18  =  0.51  cm was established directly from the distribution of the vertical component of the particle trajectories at the centre of the target .",
    "this is possible , since for the momentum reconstruction only the origin of the track in the horizontal plane is used , while the vertical component remains a free parameter .",
    "as shown in figure  [ y_tar ] , the reconstructed distribution of the vertical component of the reaction points indeed can be described well by a gaussian distribution with the @xmath35  =  0.53  cm .",
    "the width of this distribution is primarily due to the vertical spread of a proton beam .",
    "the spread caused by multiple scattering and drift chambers resolution was determined to be about 0.13  cm ( standard deviation )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath36  0.51  cm .",
    "the effect of a possible drift chamber misalignment , i.  e.  an inexactness of the angle @xmath37 in figure  [ elas_princip ] , was estimated to cause a shift in the momentum plane by 0.15  cm for @xmath19 .",
    "this gives a rather large systematical bias in the estimation of the absolute value of @xmath19 , but it does not affect the parameter  @xmath17 , and still allows for the determination of relative beam shifts @xmath19 during the measurement cycle .",
    "it is possible to use the method described here to control the size and position of the beam relative to the target .",
    "this was demonstrated during the experimental run performed in february 1998  @xcite , when for the first time longitudinal and horizontal stochastic cooling were used at the cosy accelerator .",
    "+ the horizontal stochastic cooling  @xcite is used to squeeze the proton beam in the horizontal direction until the beam reaches the equilibrium between the cooling and the heating due to the target .",
    "the size of an uncooled beam increases during the cycle , as can be seen in figure  [ sx_sy_cykl]a , which shows the spreading of the beam in the vertical plane during the 60 minutes cycle .",
    "this was expected since stochastic cooling in the vertical plane was not used in this case .",
    "the influence of the applied cooling in the horizontal plane is clearly visible in figure  [ sx_sy_cykl]b . during the first five minutes of the cycle the horizontal size of the beam of about @xmath38",
    "protons was reduced by a factor of 2 , reaching the equilibrium conditions , and remaining constant for the rest of the cosy cycle .",
    "figure  [ trans_paral_cykl ] depicts the accuracy of the momentum reconstruction , reflected in the spread of the data , which is mainly due to the finite horizontal size of the beam and target overlap .",
    "the upper and lower panel correspond to the first and the last minute of the measurement cycle , respectively .",
    "the data were analyzed correcting for the relative target and beam shifts  @xmath19 as determined by the method discussed above .",
    "the movement of the beam relative to the target during the cycle is quantified in figure  [ sx_sy_cykl]c .",
    "the shift of the beam denotes also changes of the average beam momentum , due to the nonzero dispersion at the target position .",
    "the beam reaches stability after some minutes .",
    "this can be understood as the equilibration between the energy losses when crossing @xmath39 times per second through the @xmath40 cluster target , and the power of the longitudinal stochastic cooling which can not only diminish the spread of the beam momentum but also shifts it as a whole .",
    "we presented a method which allows the proton beam dimensions and its position relative to the target to be controlled for internal beam experimental facilities .",
    "the technique is based on the measurements of the momentum distribution of elastically scattered protons and its comparison with the distributions simulated with different beam and target conditions .",
    "we demonstrated the applicability of the method in controlling the proton beam during measurement when stochastic cooling was used at the synchrotron cosy for the first time . *",
