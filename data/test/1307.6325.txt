    "the understanding of the relationship between excitation parameters and oscillation regimes is a classical topic concerning bowed string instruments : for instance shelleng @xcite , or guettler guettler , or demoucron et al @xcite proposed 2d diagrams with respect to either bow force and bow position , or bow position and bow velocity .  for reed instruments ,",
    "this kind of diagrams are less numerous : in ref .",
    "@xcite , dalmont et al proposed a diagram with respect to excitation pressure and reed opening , and recently almeida et al almeida proposed a diagram with respect to blowing pressure and lip force , related to the reed opening .    in the minimum model of reed , clarinet - like instruments , three parameters are considered : i ) the mouth pressure , ii ) the reed opening at rest , iii ) the length of the resonator  assumed to be cylindrical . in ref .",
    "dalmont:05 , a supplementary parameter was added : the loss parameter of the resonator ( using the raman model , that considers resonator losses independent of frequency ) .",
    "this allowed explaining the extinction of sound when the mouth pressure becomes very large .",
    "we notice that the agreement of the theoretical results  with experimental results was qualitatively satisfactory ( see ref .",
    "dalmont:07 ) .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to revisit the paper by dalmont et al@xcite : the focus is the search for a diagram of oscillation regimes of reed instruments with respect to two parameters : the reed opening , and the loss parameter .",
    "the choice of these two parameters is justified by the fact that the third parameter , the blowing pressure , is the easiest to modify for the instrumentalist .",
    "the elements of this diagram were rather complete in ref .",
    "@xcite , but phenomena occurring for strong losses , especially at the emergence of the sound , were not investigated .",
    "the use of simplified models for the prediction of the oscillation regimes is classical for musical instruments producing self - sustained oscillations . for the calculation of the instability thresholds ,",
    "linearization was used ( see wilson and beavers @xcite or silva et al @xcite ) , while for ab initio computation , the iterated map scheme was studied ( see mc intyre et al @xcite , maganza et al @xcite , taillard et al @xcite ) .",
    "the interest of the model chosen in the present paper is that analytical formulas are possible , given clear dependence of the parameters ( for other models , numerical calculations could be possible by using similar basic ideas , using for instance continuation methodskarkar or time - domain methods @xcite ) .",
    "the analytical calculations presented hereafter are slightly different than those of ref .",
    "they also are limited to the limit cycles corresponding to the two - state oscillating regime , but are based upon a generalization of the fact that for this regime , when no losses are present , the flow rate is a constant .",
    "this regime is the most similar to what musicians consider as a normal \" sound . in particular the method allows studying the character of the emergence and extinction bifurcations of this regime , which are important properties related to the possibility to play pianissimo or not , and more generally to the ease of playing . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the extinction bifurcation can be direct or inverse ; here it is shown that this is true also for the emergence bifurcation .    in section [ model ] , the basic model of ref .",
    "@xcite is reminded ( see also @xcite ) , and a treatment of the problem based upon a unique quantity , the pressure difference @xmath0 is presented in section [ recu ] .",
    "this leads to a simple graphical analysis of the two - state regime , explained in section [ exis ] , yielding a proof that it can not exist with reverse flow , and an easy calculation method . then some blowing pressure thresholds ( stability , existence ,",
    "... ) are calculated with respect to the parameters of interest ( loss , reed opening ) .    in section [ ct ] the thresholds related to the instability of the regimes",
    "are calculated . then by making two thresholds equal ,",
    "the mouth pressure can be eliminated and limits of existence and stability of the static and two - state regimes are found in section [ dia ] : this allows drawing the diagram sought .",
    "finally a discussion is proposed concerning the existence of oscillating regimes ( section [ disc ] ) , with an attempt to consider more realistic models and a discussion about musical consequences .",
    "we briefly remind the basic elements of the model , the non - linear characteristic of the exciter , and the origin of the iteration method , thanks to a simplified treatment of the resonator .      in a quasi static regime , the flow @xmath1 entering the resonant cavity",
    "is modeled with the help of an approximation of the bernoulli equation , as discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "comparison with experiment can be found in ref .",
    "we note @xmath2 the acoustic pressure inside the mouthpiece , assumed to be equal to the one at the output of the reed channel , @xmath3 the pressure inside the mouth of the player . for small values of the difference : @xmath4the reed remains close to its equilibrium position , and the flow @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath5 ; for larger values of this difference , the reed moves and , when the difference reaches the closure pressure @xmath6 , it completely blocks the flow .",

    "a similar discussion could be done for the destabilization of the two - state regime into more complicated regimes ( see section [ lit ] ) .",

    "a generalization of the present study is out of the scope of the present paper , but it is interesting to note that the condition @xmath262 can be easily generalized when these assumptions are not done , as explained hereafter .",
    "when losses depend on frequency , it is possible to use the characteristic equation obtained by linearizing the nonlinear equation around the pressure of the static regime @xmath151 , and writing the approximation of the first harmonic:@xmath263where @xmath264 is the admittance of the fundamental frequency . the characteristic equation is written as:@xmath265as it is well known ( see ref .",

    "moreover taking into account the frequency dependence of the losses leads to a distinction between the threshold of the fundamental regime and the overblown \" regimes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : this distinction does not exist with the raman model , which allows a distinction based upon the initial conditions only .    as a summary",
    ", it can be said that if we suppose that the impedance peak of the operating frequency is higher than the other ones , the emergence bifurcation is direct and the limit @xmath273 is valid .",

    "the large increase of radiation losses at higher frequency due to the open toneholes lattice ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) does not affect the highest peak , therefore the main result of the present paper can be extrapolated to a large number of notes of a real clarinet .",

    "( [ e80 ] ) leads to the following result:@xmath283for a lossless reed , @xmath284 : the limit of the losses in the tube allowed for having a sound is increased by the reed dynamics , which favors the sound production .",
    "but the effect of the reed losses is to decrease the limit .",
    "it can be concluded that reed losses and resonator losses act in the same sense concerning the range of parameter allowing sound production ( this conclusion is valid for the direct - bifurcation case ) .",
    "the previous results can be useful in order to understand and teach important aspects of the sound control by the instrumentalist .",
    "such an objective knowledge should largely increase the pedagogical efficiency .",
    "otherwise the approach of the problems remains more subjective and the explanations can be lengthy and less clear .",
    "one of the most useful aspects is about _ pianissimo _ playing .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams show that the players have two possibilities : near the emergence and near the extinction .",
    "the first possibility is used for playing _ dolce _ , with a quasi monochromatic sound , but the sound is noisy and can not be sustained for a long time , due to high value of the airflow @xmath285 ( see fig .",
    "[ pfigi ] ) .",
    "the dynamic is not easy to control because of the steepness of the bifurcation diagram near @xmath147 .",
    "the second possibility , near @xmath161 , conducts to a clean pianissimo , with a sound richer in high harmonics .",
    "this can however only be achieved by crossing the curve ( [ e23 ] ) in fig.pertes4 , in order to reach the region ii where the extinction bifurcation is direct .",
    "this property is usually unknown by the players ( the ability of playing such a magical `` pianissimo is often attributed exclusively to the quality '' of the reed ) .",
    "the beginners reduce the reed opening ( @xmath286 by biting `` the reed and this causes unwanted effects : the pitch rises considerably and such a bending stress can cause a plastic ( irreversible ) deformation of the reed . the skilled player can reach region ii by increasing the damping due to the lip and use a high blowing pressure near the extinction threshold , playing in the reverse way ( decreasing the mouth pressure for playing louder , see fig .",
    "[ pfigii ] ) .",
    "the lip comes very near to the tip of the reed , with a moderate lip pressure .",
    "this effect is probably similar to an increase of @xmath48 , resulting in a displacement of the playing parameters on the @xmath287 plane exactly in the wanted direction , increasing the value of @xmath41 and decreasing the value of the parameter @xmath18 proportionally to @xmath288 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath18 is probably due to an increase of the reed stiffness . decreasing @xmath18 without biting '' too much",
    "could also be achieved by modifying the hydrodynamics of the airflow entering the channel , in order to increase the _ vena contracta _ , but to our knowledge no experimental evidence shows that the player can indeed modify significantly the _ vena contracta_. conversely , it seems that the parameter @xmath47 can not be significantly controlled by the player ( in another way than by modifying the length of the air column ) . in real life",
    ", this parameter of static airflow resistance may not be determined only by the length and the diameter of the bore but certainly also by hydrodynamic effects near the channel , due to the viscosity of the air .",
    "this acts in a similar but possibly stronger way than the static resistance of the bore .",
    "practical tests show that the effects predicted in the zones iii and iv are indeed observed in some pathological situations , despite the fact that our theoretical model would require many meters of a tube of small diameter to obtain such high values of @xmath47 .    to include the musician mouth in the model is obviously rather complicated , even if at low frequencies , the effect of the vocal tract is not important",
    ". therefore the previous analysis requires some conjectures . besides the problems of bifurcation , the analysis of the raman model permits establishing some facts useful for the musician :    * the calculation of the mean flow shows that the most economical blowing pressure is near the beating threshold in region i ( corresponding to normal playing )",
    "this explains that skilled players can sustain the sound significantly longer than beginners . *",
    "the transients are much faster if @xmath18 is large ( see ref .",
    "kergomard:95 ) ; weak reeds help doing this , as well as using a moderate lip pressure .",
    "this simplifies the staccato learning . * the effects of leaks in the air column ( misplacement of a finger , defective pads ) increase the value of @xmath56 , so that regions 0 , and probably iii or iv can be possibly visited ( see section [ fdl ] ) .",
    "almost any control can be destroyed over the dynamics ( or at least rendering the dynamic control more difficult ) , despite of the attempts of the clarinettist to supply more energy to the instrument by opening the embouchure , increasing @xmath18 .",
    "the present paper is focused on limit cycles corresponding to two - state regimes , and is a complement to the paper @xcite , which was focused on transients .",
    "thanks to a formulation focused on the pressure difference between mouth and mouthpiece , the effect of the nonlinear function on the production of the two - state regime can be analyzed , and especially the role of the losses .",
    "the map shown in fig [ pertes4 ] can certainly be improved by using more complex models , but we think that some results are robust .",
    "when the reed opening at rest is very small or when the reed stiffness is very large ( i.e. when the dimensionless parameter @xmath18 is very small ) , losses can be too large and the sound production becomes impossible .",
    "a complement to this conclusion is the following : for @xmath18 larger than @xmath289 , when losses increase , the emergence bifurcation becomes inverse before the sound disappears , and the instrument becomes more difficult to play . for @xmath18",
    "smaller than this value , when losses increase , there is a direct passage from the direct emergence bifurcation to the absence of sound .",
