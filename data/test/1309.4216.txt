    "the control of the light - matter interaction at the nanometer scale and its use for the development of novel schemes for processing of quantum information have been among the most active research areas in the last years .",
    "strong light - matter interaction is often achieved in two - level systems in the realm of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite .",
    "cavity - qed experiments in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite gave rise to a number of applications , particularly in quantum information processing and quantum networking @xcite , as well as for single photon emitters @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the simultaneous confinement of excitons and photons @xcite in these systems .",
    "if the two - level system is coherently driven by strong resonant excitation , mixed exciton - photon states ( dressed states ) are formed , which are at the origin of the well - known mollow triplet @xcite observed in the optical emission of atoms @xcite and qds under resonant excitation @xcite .",
    "strong cavity emission also occurs even when the qd emitter is not in resonance with the cavity @xcite , and several cavity - feeding mechanisms have been proposed @xcite for this phenomenon , including the intermediation by acoustic phonons @xcite .",
    "simultaneous coupling of more than one qd to the same cavity mode ( cm ) is also possible when there is sufficient spectral and spatial overlap @xcite . in principle , even under non resonant conditions , the coupling between multiple qds and the cavity could allow to store and retrieve information on the coupled system through different spectral channels , opening the way to transferring quantum information via photons between remote nodes of a solid - state - based network .",
    "preliminar steps in this direction , as cavity - mediated qd coupling between two qds coupled to the same cavity , have been reported for p - state excitation by e.gallardo et al @xcite . and",
    "for s - state excitation by a.majumdar et al @xcite . also dressing of a qd state by a laser field and readout of the dressed spectral distribution by the cavity emission",
    "has been reported by a.majumdar et al .",
    "@xcite    in this work we study a system of two distant inas / gaas qds weakly coupled to a common cm under coherent bichromatic excitation .",
    "we show that dressing of one of the qds by the laser field can be effectively readout by the optical emission of a second qd , in addition to the cavity emission .",
    "this result is a significant advance over previous work @xcite in the use of qds for solid state quantum networks , as it demonstrates the feasibility of information transfer between distant qds coupled to a common cavity , bringing closer the use of qd / cavity pairs as nodes of a network for quantum information processing . upon simultaneous pumping of the system by two continuous wave ( cw ) lasers ,",
    "dressed states are created .",
    "one ( fixed laser ) is in resonance with the s - state of one of the qds while the other laser ( variable laser ) continuously scans across a small energy range around the frequency of the fixed laser .",
    "because the intensities of both ( fixed and variable ) lasers are comparable , the variable laser can not be treated as a linear perturbation of the fixed one , i.e. our measurement is not a typical pump - probe experiment .",
    "the spectral distribution of the dressed states in the qd excited by the laser field determines the population of the excited state of the other qd , which is measured by the intensity variation of its optical emission as well as of the cavity emission as a function of the detuning of the variable laser .",
    "information on the dressed states of one qd is , therefore , obtained from the emission intensity of the other qd , also weakly coupled to the same cm . the excitation and detection ports are interchangeable .",
    "indeed we show that the cavity mediated inter - talk between qds operates in both directions : up - conversion ( uc ) for excitation at lower energy than that of detection and down - conversion ( dc ) for the opposite way .",
    "the coupling requires the exchange ( emission for dc or absorption for uc ) of acoustic phonons .",
    "the dependence of measurable properties on both fixed and variable laser frequencies and intensities are described by a master equation for the dynamics of the system density matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental results can be successfully fitted by the calculated intensity distributions , thus giving a good understanding of the physics behind the experiments .",
    "in this section we develop a theoretical model describing the optical emission properties of our two - qds simultaneously coupled to a photonic crystal microcavity , under bichromatic resonant excitation . to this end , we consider a 3-level system ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) formed by _",
    "( i ) _ a ground state labeled @xmath1 , _ ( ii ) _ a state labeled @xmath2 to which lasers excite one of the qds and _ ( iii ) _ a state labeled @xmath3 , corresponding to the excitation of either the cm or the other qd , from which the system decays to @xmath1 emitting photons .",
    "transitions between states @xmath2 and @xmath3 are non - radiative .",
    "we study the dynamics of this three - level system upon coherent excitation by two lasers in order to calculate the total intensity of the transition from @xmath3 to @xmath1 ( i.e. the population of level @xmath3 ) as a function of the pumping frequencies and intensities .",
    "no distinction is made to whether state @xmath3 corresponds to a qd or the cm . in the latter case",
    ", we consider that its population is low enough to be treated as a singly occupied level , as in the case of a qd state .",
    "this is a valid approximation since , as revealed by our final results , the decay from @xmath3 to @xmath1 is much faster than the non - radiative transition from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .     and @xmath4 .",
    "dissipative processes in blue arrows labeled @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . under ideal resonant conditions @xmath9 coincides with @xmath10.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] +",
    "the coherent part of the dynamics is described by a hamiltonian ( hereafter @xmath11 ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath10 are the energies of the excited levels with respect to the ground state , @xmath14 and @xmath4 are the rabi frequencies related to the intensity of the variable and the fixed pump laser , respectively and @xmath15 and @xmath9 are their respective energies ( cf .",

    "the `` double peak '' shape of the qd@xmath72 integrated emission intensity in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) is a consequence of the dressed structure of qd@xmath73 .",
    "the first step in our experiment is the excitation by two lasers ( variable and fixed ) of qd@xmath73 , which dresses its quantum states .",

    "this double peak is reminiscent of a similar double feature already observed in absorption experiments involving states dressed under the action of two lasers @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of this double structure is similar to the mollow triplet observed in fluorescence experiments except that , in this case , the central feature of the triplet disappears due to a perfect cancellation of absorption and stimulated emission processes @xcite .",

    "@xcite we get an excellent fitting with our model as shown by the continuous lines in fig .  [ fig3](a ) and",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "fitting parameters are given in the first two rows of table i. the main difference of fitting parameters between figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and  [ fig3](b ) is the overall intensity f , as well as @xmath97 , which is weaker in the case of qd@xmath72 readout .",
    "the rest of the parameters have values with moderate changes within the fitting uncertainty .",
    "in particular , the small asymmetry change between figs .  [ fig3](a ) and  [ fig3](b ) is due to a slight accidental detuning of the fixed laser with respect to the qd@xmath73 emission @xcite ( @xmath98 in our model ) .",
    "this detuning is of the order of @xmath99 , i.e. one order of magnitude smaller than the width of the qd pl - emission ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the total emitted intensity in the dc process ( figs .  [ fig3](c ) and  [ fig3](d ) ) is qualitatively similar to the uc case , although fits by the model are not numerically stable , thus reducing their reliability .",
    "the reason lies probably in the weaker and noisier signal in the dc spectra as compared to those of the uc ones.this prevents an overall fitting of all experimental data with common parameters .",
    "nevertheless , fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) indicates that the spectral distribution of the dressed states of the excited qd@xmath72 is translated to the energy dependence of the integrated emission intensity of the `` detector '' qd@xmath73 .     and",
    "( b ) qd@xmath72.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    our model also describes the dependence of the dressed state spectral distribution on excitation power of both fixed and variable laser .",
    "it must be underlined that we do not expect a square root dependence of the splitting on the fixed laser power , because both fixed and variable laser intensities are comparable . instead , the energy distribution of the dressed state population depends on the combined action of the two lasers in a non - trivial way .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows power dependent measurements of the cavity emission , as it is stronger than that of the qds .",
    "the integrated emission intensity of the cm for different excitation intensities ( @xmath100 ) of the fixed laser is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) for the uc case and in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) for the dc case . for excitation with the variable laser alone ( bottom panel ) ,",
    "a single peak is obtained evidencing the cavity - qd coupling upon excitation resonant with the s - states .",
    "its width ( @xmath101 ) , however , is @xmath102 higher than the width of the non - resonantly excited qd@xmath73 emission ( @xmath103 ) shown in fig .",
    "this broadening reflects the relaxation process between states @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , which is absent in a pure absorption or emission transition .",
    "the solid lines again correspond to fits produced by our theoretical model , whose fitting parameters are shown in table i ( rows 2 to 4 ) .",
    "the parameters listed in table i correspond to a joint best fit of spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the decrease of the dephasing rate with pumping power observed in table i suggests that inhomogeneous broadening in our experiment is not only due to noise produced by phonons , but also to other mechanisms as input / output coupling efficiency @xcite .",
    "note , that the coupling strengths @xmath5 and @xmath6 do not change upon increasing @xmath4 while @xmath104 increases significantly with pump power .",
    "this is partially attributed to an increase in the phonon occupation number @xmath30 .",
    "in summary , we demonstrate dressing of excitonic qd states by two - colour resonant excitation in a system formed by two qds weakly coupled to a common cavity mode .",
    "the spectral distribution of the dressed states of any of the qds is efficiently readout by the integrated emission intensity of the other qd , which is spatially separated by @xmath105 from the excited one , as well as by the cavity emission intensity .",
    "the experimental results are explained by a theoretical model describing the dynamics of a three level system coherently excited by the two lasers .",
    "the efficient excitation and detection through different spectral channels , which are interchangeable , demonstrates the feasibility for the use of qds as nodes in an integrated quantum network based on coupled multiple qds - cavity systems , even when the two qds are not identical .       *",
