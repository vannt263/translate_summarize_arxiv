    "the ability to realise ultracold quantum gases in periodic and disordered potentials has enabled detailed studies of fascinating effects originating in solid state physics .",
    "ongoing investigations of single particle phenomena such as anderson localisation as well as many particle effects like the bose - glass phase and the mott insulator @xcite show the variety of possibilities these ensembles offer .",
    "especially the non - intuitive dynamics of quantum gases in periodic potentials is of interest for theoretical and experimental investigations , since quantum gases have enabled the first direct observation of bloch oscillations  @xcite in tilted periodic potentials  @xcite . in these systems",
    "the periodicity leads to an oscillatory motion instead of a linear acceleration of the particles subjected to an external force .    in solid state systems scattering at imperfections of the crystal structure",
    "leads to damping of bloch oscillations on timescales much shorter than the oscillation period itself .",
    "therefore bloch oscillations of electrons are only observable in semiconductor super lattices  @xcite , where the large spatial period leads to high oscillation frequencies , which are faster than the damping .",
    "optical lattices on the other hand constitute perfect optical crystals and allow for the observation of long lived bloch oscillations  @xcite . the experimental control of lattice parameters such as lattice depth and spacing",
    ", the possibility to detect the atomic cloud with absorption imaging and the very small momentum spread of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) have enabled detailed studies of this quantum effect .",
    "a comparison of these systems gives rise to the question how the controlled addition of disorder to an optical lattice will affect the dynamics of particles in such a periodic potential .",
    "disorder can be realised with additional optical potentials  @xcite , impurity atoms  @xcite or the roughness of the trapping potential close to the surface of atom chips  @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous application of a homogeneous force and the optical disorder potential constitutes a spatially inhomogeneous acceleration .",
    "this inhomogeneity can have important consequences for the application of bloch oscillations as a sensitive tool for high precision measurements of small forces  @xcite , since it leads to a dephasing of the quasimomentum and thus to a damping of the centre - of - mass oscillation  @xcite .",
    "therefore a detailed quantitative understanding of the effect of the disorder and the underlying mechanism is indispensable for future applications .",
    "we investigate the effect of a small disordered potential on bloch oscillations of bose - einstein condensates in a 1d optical lattice potential .",
    "our results indeed show that the inhomogeneity leads to significant damping of the centre - of - mass motion . the damping rate increases with disorder depth and is quantitatively compared to numerical simulations using the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .",
    "furthermore we show that the disorder induced broadening of the quasimomentum distribution , which is the underlying mechanism for the damping of bloch oscillations , reduces the fraction of atoms in the bec .",
    "the acceleration of particles in periodic potentials leads to an oscillatory motion instead of a linear increase in velocity . since this is a pure single particle effect , it is possible to describe the underlying physics in a 1d model , while a quantitative analysis of the effects of disorder and interactions require a 3d description , as reported in a previous work  @xcite .",
    "we briefly discuss the main features necessary for the understanding of bloch oscillations while a comprehensive review can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the periodicity of the potential implies that the eigenfunctions obey the same translational symmetry as the potential @xmath0 where the phase difference @xmath1 from site - to - site is called quasimomentum and @xmath2 is the lattice constant .",
    "since the eigenfunctions are periodic , it is possible to restrict the description of the dynamics to the first brillouin zone [ -@xmath3,@xmath3 ] . according to the acceleration theorem @xmath5",
    "an additional potential gradient will cause the quasimomentum to evolve linearly in time , because the energy offset from site - to - site leads to a linear increase of the phase difference from site - to - site during the time evolution . in combination with the periodicity of the band structure this causes an oscillatory motion , since the group velocity is proportional to the derivative of the band structure .",
    "the oscillation period @xmath6 depends on the applied force @xmath7 and the lattice constant .",
    "the resulting amplitude @xmath8 is given by the width of the first band @xmath9 and the force . since",
    "this amplitude is only a few micrometres for typical experimental parameters , the bloch oscillations are conveniently analysed in momentum space via time - of - flight ( tof ) absorption imaging .",
    "while the oscillation can be described in a simple 1d model , the complex dynamics in a disordered potential gradient and the role of interactions have to be analysed with a full 3d model .",
    "all numerical simulations presented in this work are obtained using the 3d gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath10\\psi(\\textbf{r } ) = \\mu\\psi(\\textbf{r } ) .",

    "[ absorptionimages].,width=453 ]    due to interactions between the atoms , bloch oscillations of bose - einstein condensates suffer , contrary to the case of fermions  @xcite , from dynamical instabilities  @xcite . in the outer half of the brillouin zone",
    "the nonlinear coupling leads to an exponential growth of small perturbations .",
    "independent of inhomogeneities in the potential they are responsible for a damping of the bloch oscillations . therefore it is necessary to reduce the dynamical instability in order to investigate the effect of the disorder on the bloch oscillations .",
    "this can be accomplished with a combination of a high potential gradient  @xcite and a reduction of the nonlinear interactions . in recent",
    "work long lived bloch oscillations of bose - einstein condensates were realised  @xcite by decreasing the s - wave scattering length with a feshbach resonance , essentially turning off the atomic interaction . in the experiments reported here the interactions",
    "were reduced by decreasing the density of the bec , to enable the observations of disorder induced damping of bloch oscillations .",

    "a detailed description of our apparatus is given in  @xcite .",
    "nearly pure bec of up to @xmath23 atoms are produced , however all experiments described here were carried out with @xmath24 atoms to reduce the interaction energy , and to ensure that no significant thermal background is present .",
    "after production of the bec the magnetic offset field was adiabatically increased to 91 g within @xmath25 , thus lowering the radial trapping frequency to @xmath26 .",
    "this reduces the interaction energy by a factor of 6.25 , which in combination with low atom numbers sufficiently inhibits the dynamical instability , such that up to four undamped bloch oscillation periods can be observed .",
    "the following procedure was used to observe the bloch oscillations . after decreasing the radial trapping frequency the intensity of the optical lattice",
    "was adiabatically increased to its final value within @xmath27 .",
    "subsequently the atoms were subjected to either a homogeneous potential gradient or the spatially inhomogeneous one for a variable time .",
    "finally all potentials were turned off at the same time and the atomic cloud was detected after a time - of - flight of @xmath28 by absorption imaging .",
    "the 1d optical lattice is provided by a standing light field at a wavelength of @xmath29 , which is superimposed on the axial direction of the magnetic trap with a waist of @xmath30 at the position of the atoms .",
    "the investigations were performed at a lattice depth of @xmath31 , since low lattice depths lead to a large width of the energy band and therefore to a high maximal group velocity .",
    "this results in an oscillation amplitude of the centre - of - mass motion of @xmath32 after a tof of @xmath28 , which can easily be detected , while the bloch oscillations are not affected by landau - zener tunnelling @xcite .",

    "we observe good agreement between experimental and theoretical values of the damping coefficients .    to show , that the broadening of the quasimomentum spectrum is the underlying mechanism of the damping , we analyse the experimental data with a second approach . since the dephasing of the quasimomenta increases the number of atoms with varying momenta , the number of atoms in the bec peaks is reduced  @xcite .",

    "to analyse this effect quantitatively , we estimate the number of atoms in the bec @xmath64 at different times of the bloch oscillation by fitting thomas - fermi profiles to the characteristic peaks of the bec .",
    "the fraction of atoms in the bec is calculated by comparing the number of atoms in these peaks with the total atom number @xmath65 .",

    "the lines are fits to the data with an exponential decay .",

    "this is in agreement with a gaussian shape of the damping envelope given in eqn .",
    "[ fitfunktion ] and confirms that the dephasing of the quasimomenta is the underlying mechanism for the damping of the centre - of - mass motion .",
    "hence only a significant broadening of the quasimomentum leads to a relevant damping .    note that even at a disorder depth of @xmath66 a reduction and therefore a dephasing is observed due to the interparticle interactions , while the centre - of - mass oscillation in fig .",
    "[ dampingcenterofmass ] is still unaffected .",
    "the decay times @xmath67 from fig .",
    "[ contrastexperiment ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ contrastversusdisorder ] as a function of the disorder depth .",
    "the decreasing fraction of atoms in the bec peaks again confirms that stronger disorder leads to faster dephasing of the momentum distribution and that this broadening of the quasimomentum is the underlying mechanism for the damping of the bloch oscillations .",
    "we have presented the first experimental investigation on disorder induced damping of bloch oscillations of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "the application of an additional disorder potential during the oscillation leads to a strong damping of the centre - of - mass motion and to a significant reduction of the fraction of atoms in the bec .",
    "the observed damping rates are in good agreement with predictions based on numerical solutions of the full gross - pitaevskii equation and show that the underlying physical mechanism for the damping is the broadening of the quasimomentum spectrum due to the spatially varying phase evolution of the condensate .",
    "we show that even very small disorder results in fast dephasing of the quasimomentum and therefore damping of the bloch oscillation .",
    "since the disorder presented here is equivalent to a spatially inhomogeneous force , the results are of special interest for the application of bloch oscillations for high precision spectroscopy of very small forces . to reach high precision in such experiments it is essential to follow a large number of bloch oscillations .",
    "this number may be reduced if the observed force is spatially inhomogeneous on length scales comparable to the extend of the condensate .",
    "the good agreement between theory and experiment shows the applicability of our method to analyse the effects of spatially varying forces , and allows for estimates of the effect of small inhomogeneities for future experiments .",
