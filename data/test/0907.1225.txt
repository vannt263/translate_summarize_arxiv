    "we checked shutter time dependence and zero point variations across the field . in the second night",

    "the airmass corrections of 0.15 in v , 0.25 in b and 0.07 in i , have been done using the standard values given for la palma in clear nights ( with no dust in the atmosphere ) , available at the dolores webpagepalma@xmath13sky.html ]    the derived calibration equations are :    v = 28.44 - 0.06(v - i)+v    i = 28.28 - 0.07(v - i)+i    b = 28.59 + 0.12(b - v)+b    v = 28.43 - 0.06(b - v)+v    where the zero points are calculated for 10s exposures at 1.15 airmasses , with an aperture of @xmath14 .",
    "the bvi are instrumental magnitudes ( counts in adus , gain 1 e-/adu ) .",
    "bvi are the calibrated magnitudes .",
    "the zero points were remarkably stable and identical in the two nights .",
    "no shutter time effects have been detected at the 0.01 mag .",
    "level in the exposure range of our images ( from 1 to 30 s ) . in the @xmath15 pixels central area",
    "the standard stars showed a very good uniformity , but their flux rapidly decreased at the frame corners .",
    "the repeated measurements of the standard stars across the field have been used to separate the contribution of the sky concentration from the flat field , including the decrease of sensitivity of the system ( possibly due to some vignetting ) at the edge .",
    "measurements performed with different apertures excluded the possibility that the loss of light at the edges was due to degradation of the psf .",
    "the ccd frame reductions were performed using a slightly more complex procedure than the standard flat field division .",
    "this was needed due to the analysis of the standard star fluxes across the field , compared to the background brightness , and showed a sky flux excess in an area roughly corresponding to the central 500 pixels .",
    "this excess is interpreted as the effect called `` sky concentration '' ( @xcitecalibration.ps ] ) .",
    "this is known to be caused by internal reflections and it is color dependent . in our images it reached about 6% in i , 5% in v ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) and it was almost negligible in b. if the light concentration is not removed from the flatfields , it causes a systematic photometric error across the field of the same amount .",
    "the light loss at the edges was instead almost constant with the colors , up to 5% from center to corner .",
    "the flatfielding ( after bias correction ) was performed in four main steps : ( 1 ) a map of sky concentration was prepared using the standard stars , compared to the sky level ; ( 2 ) the contribution of the light concentration was extracted from the flatfields and smoothed ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) ; ( 3 ) the light concentration was scaled to the value of the sky images and subtracted ; ( 4 ) the flatfield obtained after removing the light concentration was used to correct the high frequencies and sensitivity variations ( including vignetting ) .",
    "the corrected images have been processed using daophot ii and allstars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the software is available in midas for the instrumental photometry of individual stars , and it was converted into the standard johnson - cousins system , defined from the landolt stars , using the above calibration equations .",
    "the conversion from the instrumental ( psf convolved ) magnitudes to the calibrated ones revealed an additional problem related to the image quality variation across the field .",
    "this produces a variable aperture correction , changing with time and filter .",
    "in pfleiderer2 images it was of the order of 0.02 magnitudes , with a peak around 0.04 magnitudes at the extreme corners .",
    "for this reason we adopted the aperture correction established from stars located in the central 200 pixels which is representative of most of the image within about 1% to 2% .    the resulting calibration accuracy , taking into account the uncertainties in the calibration equations ( @xmath160.01 mag ) , the flatfield procedure ( an additional 0.01 - 0.02 mag ) and the aperture corrections ( 0.02 mag ) , is estimated to be within @xmath17 in a single filter .",
    "the relative photometric errors have been derived from short exposures ( 15s in v and 10s in i ) frame to frame images .",
    "the errors are 0.03 mag for 14 @xmath18 v @xmath18 16.5 , increasing to about 0.2mag at v=20.5 . in order to have the errors for our deep 600s exposures ,",
    "they must be scaled to the corresponding magnitudes .",
    "the 600 sec images imply a factor 40 larger in exposure times , and the corresponding error values can be estimated from the ones given above .",
    "field - stars are an important contaminant of cmds in rich fields , especially near the disk and bulge .",
    "the decontamination algorithm employed here is based on a three - dimensional routine designed for the wide - field photometry of 2mass data , as developed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in the present case we adapted the original algorithm to work with photometry obtained with a large telescope and a single color . for clarity , we recall the basic procedures .",
    "the algorithm divides the whole magnitude and color ranges into a grid of cmd cells . for a given cluster extraction and comparison field , it estimates the relative number densities of probable field and cluster stars present in each cell .",
    "the estimated number of field stars is subsequently subtracted from each cell .    *",
    "decontamination results for different cluster / field contrasts are given and discussed in the above cited papers .",
    "the reference cell dimensions are @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ". however , to minimize spurious results , several runs of the decontamination procedure are used , with different input parameters . *    in the present paper , different cell sizes are considered , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 taken from 0.5 , 1.0 and 2.0 times the reference values .",
    "also , the cell grid is shifted by -1/3 , 0 and + 1/3 of the respective cell size in both the colour and magnitude axes .",
    "taking together all the grid / cell size setups , we are left with 81 different and independent decontamination combinations .",
    "stars are ranked according to the number of times they survive each run . finally , only the highest ranked stars are considered as cluster members and transposed to the respective decontaminated cmd . in the case of pfleiderer2 ,",
    "the decontaminated stars have a survival frequency above @xmath23 .",
    "we note that the two bright and red stars ( figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] ) are among those with @xmath24 , which implies that the observed field is scarcely populated of stars with similar colour and magnitude .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we investigate the surface density ( @xmath25 , in units of @xmath26 ) distribution of pfleiderer2 both with the observed ( left panels ) and decontaminated ( right ) photometry .",
    "we also include the respective isopleth surface maps ( bottom panels ) , which show a rather circular geometry in the stellar distribution around the center of pfleiderer2 .",
    "as expected , the cluster is much more contrasted in the decontaminated data .",
    "fig .  [ fig4 ] shows the @xmath27 vs. @xmath28 cmd of essentially the full field ( r @xmath18 1000 pixels , or r @xmath18 4.2 ) * around pfleiderer2 , reaching the photometric limit of @xmath29 . as anticipated in sect .",
    "[ decont ] , field contamination is dominant in this direction .",
    "a few bright and red stars show up at @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which might suggest a metal - rich cluster .",
    "*    the fit of padova isochrones ( @xcite ) to the v vs. v - i cmd of pfleiderer2 is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5]a , b for extractions of r @xmath18 10  and 30 .",
    "a tilted red giant branch ( rgb ) is seen , together with a clump of stars at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , compatible with a red horizontal branch ( hb ) .",
    "a tilted rgb is indicative of a high metallicity as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we also note that the spread across the diagram is due to differential reddening .",
    "the fit of the isochrones to the cluster sequences in these figs . required a high metallicity of z=0.019 ( [ fe / h]@xmath340.0 ) .",
    "it might be one of the most metal - rich globular clusters in the galaxy .",
    "the age estimated is 10@xmath12 gyr , compatible with a globular cluster .",
    "this leads to a reddening of e(v - i)=1.34 .",
    "assuming e(v - i)/e(b - v)=1.33 ( @xcite ) , we get e(b - v)=1.01@xmath10.15 , which corresponds to a@xmath35 = 3.13 .",
    "this reddening value is compatible with the dust emission maps by @xcite , of e(b - v)=1.15 .",
    "we derive an observed distance modulus of ( m - m)@xmath35 = 19.2 , an absolute distance modulus of ( m - m)@xmath36 = 16.07 , and a distance from the sun d@xmath0 = 16.4@xmath12 kpc .    assuming the conservative distance of the sun to the galaxy center to be r@xmath0 = 8.0 kpc ( @xcite )",
    ", the galactocentric coordinates are x = 7.0 kpc ( x @xmath37 0 is on the other side of the galaxy ) , y = 6.1 kpc and z = 2.7 kpc , and the distance to the galactic center is r@xmath2 = @xmath38kpc .",
    "a metal - rich globular cluster located far from the center is not a unique case .",
    "terzan7 with a 47 tuc - like metallicity , in the sagittarius dwarf , is even farther from the galactic center at r@xmath2 = 15.9 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , pfleiderer2 is apparently not related to any dwarf galaxy and is more metal - rich .",
    "the metal - rich cluster palomar8 has [ fe / h]=-0.48 and r@xmath2 = 5.6 kpc ( h96 ) , whereas palomar11 has [ fe / h]=-0.39 ( h96 ) and r@xmath2 = 9 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , pfleiderer2 has at least two other analog metal - rich globular clusters located far from the bulge . in case",
    "there is no relation to a dwarf galaxy , it might be that these clusters are at apogalacticon , possibly tracing such limit for the bulge .",
    "we applied the decontamination tools to the tng photometry , * as described in sect .",
    "[ decont ] . * a mosaic of cmds extracted within 120 pixels ( r @xmath18 30 )",
    "is given in fig .",
    "the upper panels show the observed v vs. v - i and i vs. v - i cmds , while the respective equal area sky extraction is given in the middle panels .",
    "the lower panels show the statistically decontaminated cmds , derived according to sect .",
    "[ decont ] using as comparison field the wide ring located within @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "an rgb , the red hb and a populous turn - off are seen , features that are clearer in the decontaminated plot .",
    "these features are also seen in the v vs b - v subtracted diagram , although not as deep as in v vs. v - i ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "* at this point it is important to recall that the two bright and red stars ( @xmath31 , @xmath41 ) have a survival frequency of 100% , with respect to the decontamination procedure ( sect .  [ decont ] ) .",
    "besides , the redder one is located at about 14  from the cluster center , while the other at about 29",
    ". taken together , these arguments imply a high probability of both being cluster members , and suggest a metal - rich cluster .",
    "*    the cmd sequences seen in these decontaminated diagrams are similar to those obtained from central extractions ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]a , b ) . * as a caveat we note that the above isochrone solutions place the turnoff at @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which corresponds to about 1 mag brighter than the photometric limit , and probably close to the completeness limit .",
    "however , the comparison with the field cmd ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) shows that the excess of stars at @xmath44 is real .",
    "*    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we test alternative isochrone solutions that explore a range of ages and metallicities .",
    "we test isochrones of 6 , 8 , 10 and 12gyr , both of solar and 1/3 solar metallicity . * assuming that the two bright and red stars are members , the metallicity turns out clearly constrained to nearly solar , since lower metallicities would require brighter gb stars .",
    "the 6gyr isochrones , although producing a reasonable fit of the turnoff and rgb , fail to describe both bright and red stars simultaneously . *",
    "although we adopted 10gyr as the best age solution , a spread of @xmath45gyr is acceptable . in the case of 8gyr",
    ", pfleiderer2 might be one of those young globular clusters such as palomar1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig8 ]",
    "we give the cluster stellar radial density distribution ( rdp ) .",
    "the central parts of the cluster show evidence of a post - core collapse , as seen in a number of other globular clusters , especially in the bulge ( @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise a smooth fit with the 3-parameter king profile is obtained throughout the rest of the cluster .",
    "this tentative fit provides a core radius of r@xmath46 ( @xmath47pc ) and a tidal radius r@xmath48 ( @xmath49pc ) .",
    "@xcite determined tidal radii of globular clusters as a function of the estimated perigalacticon distances .",
    "pfleiderer2 compared to their sample appears to be among the intrinsically smallest globulars , only comparable with the central bulge clusters ngc6522 and ngc6528 . in case the tidal radius is essentially determined by the perigalacticon tidal forces , the small size of this cluster suggests that it may reach the outer bulge ( see equation 4 in @xcite ) .    on the other hand , the total absolute magnitude , obtained by adding the stellar fluxes for the stars brighter than v=24 present in the decontaminated cmd extracted within 700 pixels , amounts to m@xmath35= -2.5 .",
    "this value would place pfleiderer2 among the least luminous globular clusters in the galaxy , like palomarclusters .",
    "therefore , if its mass is as low as that of palomarclusters such as palomar12 and palomar13 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , estimated to be of @xmath50 to @xmath51 m@xmath0 , then a perigalacticon distance of 5 to 10 kpc is inferred . in this case",
    ", it might be a low mass globular cluster that has been losing mass , or be an old open cluster , with a nearly circular orbit .    to put pfleiderer2 into perspective , in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we compare some of the astrophysical parameters derived in this paper with those of the globular clusters in h96 ( updated in 2003 - h03 ) , together with the mass ( panel d ) taken from @xcite . as anticipated above , pfleiderer2 is located in the low - luminosity tail of the globular cluster distribution ( panel a ) and not far from the galactic center ( b ) .",
    "the king tidal radius ( c ) is relatively small , consistent with its location in the galaxy , while the king core ( d ) , which encompasses the collapsed core ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) , is clearly an upper limit .",
    "disregarding the collapsed core , its king concentration parameter would suggest a relatively loose cluster ( e ) .",
    "undoubtedly , pfleiderer2 is a low - mass cluster ( f ) .",
    "the present observations deal with a faint star cluster that we identified as a globular cluster .",
    "previously , pfleiderer2 was classified as an open cluster .",
    "it is obscured in the optical , with @xmath52 , and affected by differential reddening .",
    "deep photometry was collected with the 3.58 m tng telescope , which revealed the cluster nature , although deeper photometry would still be necessary for a final conclusion .",
    "isochrone fits are compatible with a nearly solar metallicity star cluster with age within the range 8 - 12gyr , which thus puts pfleiderer2 among the few metal - rich globular clusters in the galaxy .",
    "larger apertures would be important to get deeper imaging , as well as high resolution spectroscopy to better derive its metallicity , abundance ratios , and orbital properties .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for suggestions .",
