    "recently , the proximity effect between a superconductor ( @xmath0 ) and a ferromagnet ( @xmath1 ) has attracted much attention because , due to advances in materials growth and fabrication techniques @xcite , well controlled structures , in which it can occur became available .",
    "such @xmath1/@xmath0 hybrid structures are important from the point of view of their intrinsic scientific interest , as they allow the study of the interplay between ferromagnetism and superconductivity @xcite as well as of device applications in such areas of technology as magnetoelectronics @xcite or quantum computing @xcite .    in the present context the proximity , on one hand , means the leakage of superconductivity into the ferromagnet , and on the other , the spin polarization of the superconductor . in the normal metal - superconductor systems",
    "the proximity effect has been studied over 30 years , and is now well understood @xcite to be governed by the andreev reflection @xcite processes , in which an electron at the interface is reflected as a hole while a cooper pair is transfered into superconductor .",
    "this mechanism makes the movement of electrons and holes in the normal metal highly coherent .",
    "if the normal metal is replaced by a ferromagnet a number of new phenomena may occur .",
    "for instance one may expect a version of the @xmath2 state , predicted in sixties for a bulk superconductor in a strong spin exchange field , by fulde and ferrell @xcite and larkin and ovchinikov @xcite , to be realized . in the bulk , as it is well known , the exchange field tends to polarize the conduction electrons and holes . in particular",
    "if these electrons are cooper paired , naively one would expect that either the exchange field is too week to break the pairs , or it leads to the first order phase transition to the normal state .",
    "however , as was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , for certain values of the exchange field a new superconducting depairing state is realized through first order phase transition from the @xmath3 state and it transforms continuously , by a second order phase transition , into the normal state as the strength of the exchange field is increased .",
    "this @xmath2 state has a spatially dependent order parameter corresponding to the nonzero center of mass motion of the cooper pairs .",
    "another novel feature of this state is a current flowing in the ground state .",
    "the unpaired electrons tend to congregate at one portion of the fermi surface so a quasiparticle current is produced . in order to satisfy the bloch theorem : no current in the ground state , a supercurrent , generated by the nonzero value of the pairing momentum , flows in opposite direction , and the total current is zero .",
    "interestingly , similar oscillations of the pairing amplitude ( cooper pair density ) have been predicted @xcite-@xcite in a ferromagnet proximity coupled to a superconductor .",
    "it turns out that these oscillations are responsible for the oscillatory dependence of the critical temperature on the thickness of the ferromagnetic slab @xcite .",
    "this effect as well as the corresponding oscillations of the density of states at the fermi level @xcite , have been observed experimentally @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate further the ramifications of these interesting phenomena .",
    "one of these is the formation of so called @xmath4 junction state @xcite which is also a fingerprint of the oscillatory behaviour of the pairing amplitude .",
    "the @xmath4-state effect has been extensively studied in connection with the high-@xmath5 superconductors , where due to spatially inhomogeneity of the order parameter , the cooper pair wave function can change sign at the interface and this leads to the formation of a zero - energy mid - gap state . remarkably , this zero - energy state is unstable to the occurrence of a spontaneous current flowing parallel to and within a coherence length of the interface ( see eg .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in what follows we report on our finding similar spontaneous currents but of different origin in a @xmath0/@xmath1/@xmath6 trilayer",
    ".    we also find zero energy bound states due to the finite size of the @xmath1 slab .",
    "in fact even for a @xmath7/@xmath0 heterostructure , in agreement with @xcite , we have found states within the @xmath0 gap .",
    "although the energy of these states depend on the thickness of the normal metal , they never reach zero , namely @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly , when the normal metal is replaced by a ferromagnet , these bound states split , and for certain values of the exchange field , they cross the fermi level @xcite . as we shall show , this circumstance leads to a current flow .",
    "clearly , the spontaneous current is strictly related to the zero energy states , as in the case of the high - @xmath5 superconductors , but the origin of these states is completely different . as mentioned above ,",
    "there are two competing parts to the total current in the @xmath2 state .",
    "one is related to the unpaired electron movement and the other is a supercurrent .",
    "so one may expect , that in the case of the @xmath1/@xmath0 heterostructure , these parts could be spatially unbalanced creating regions of net current flow .",
    "indeed this is what we have discovered .    a brief report of our main results",
    "has already been published @xcite . here",
    "we wish to present a more detailed and systematic study of the zero energy andreev bound states and the corresponding spontaneous current in the @xmath1/@xmath0 heterostructures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the simple model which allows for self - consistent description of the @xmath1/@xmath0 heterostructure is introduced .",
    "we also derive equations which have to be solved self - consistently .",
    "in particular , these include the maxwell s equation ( ampere s law ) for the coupling of the current to the magnetic field .",
    "then we describe some technical details concerning the principal layer technique , which allows us to describe a semi - infinite superconductor . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the nature of the andreev bound states in the ferromagnet is discussed .",
    "the spontaneously generated current and corresponding magnetic field in the ground state are studied in the sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we provide some suggestions of how one might observe the spontaneous current and its polarization experimentally .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "to study spontaneous currents and their polarization in the ferromagnet - superconductor heterostructure we have adopted a single orbital , nearest neighbour hopping hubbard model with negative @xmath9 on the @xmath0 side and zero @xmath9 otherwise .",
    "additionally we have assumed the site energies @xmath10 to be exchange split in the ferromagnet and spin independent in the superconductor .",
    "moreover , the simplest geometry allowing for a current flow is the @xmath11 system , shown in the fig.[fig1 ] , where the magnetic field in one direction , the vector potential and the current in another and the spatial modulation in a third orthogonal direction are explicitly indicated .    in short ,",
    "our model hamiltonian is given in the form : @xmath12         c^+_{i\\sigma } c_{j\\sigma } +         \\sum_{i\\sigma } \\frac{u_i}{2 } \\hat n_{i\\sigma } \\hat n_{i-\\sigma }   \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in the presence of a vector potential @xmath13 , the hopping integral is given by @xmath14 for nearest neighbour lattice sites , whose positions are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and zero otherwise .",
    "the site energies @xmath10 are @xmath17 on the superconducting side and equal to @xmath18 on the ferromagnetic side , @xmath19 is the chemical potential , the on - site interaction @xmath20 is @xmath21 in the superconductor and zero elsewhere , @xmath22 , ( @xmath23 ) are the usual electron creation ( annihilation ) operators and @xmath24 is the electron number operator .",
    "note that the above description of the electrons with charges @xmath25 includes a coupling to a magnetic field @xmath26 , which is necessary for calculating the effects of current on the electronic states .    in what follows",
    "we shall work within spin - polarized - hartree - fock - gorkov ( @xmath27 ) approximation , which means that we have approximated the interaction term in hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) by the usual mean field theory mapping : @xmath28 .",
    "for the magnetic field we have chosen the landau gauge where @xmath29 and hence @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed that the effective @xmath27 hamiltonian is periodic in the direction parallel to the interface and therefore we work in @xmath31 space in the @xmath32 direction but in real space in the @xmath33-direction ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . labelling the  planes  ( lines ) in fig.[fig1 ] by integers @xmath34 and @xmath35 at each @xmath36 point of the brillouin zone we shall solve the following @xmath27 layer index ( @xmath34 ) matrix equation for the retarded green s function matrix @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the pauli unit matrix and @xmath40 is of the form :    @xmath41    with @xmath42 .",
    "our system consists of infinite number of layers ( @xmath34 ) , because of fact that we have a semi - infinite superconductor .",
    "the @xmath1 region spreads from @xmath43 to @xmath17 , while superconductor is defined for @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in order to describe semi - infinite system",
    ", we need infinite range matrix with block elements @xmath45 ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 going from @xmath46 through @xmath17 to @xmath47 ) . in short , strictly speaking , we have to invert the infinite range matrix :    @xmath48    to render the problem traceable , it is useful to define the surface green s function ( @xmath49 ) @xcite as @xmath50^{-1}\\}_{n , n }   \\label{sgfdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath51 being semi - infinite submatrix for @xmath52 ( lower right corner of the matrix in eq.([hinf ] ) ) .",
    "the physical meaning of the @xmath49 is that it represents a square diagonal subblock corresponding to the semi - infinite bulk shown with a shaded region in the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "now we can assume , that electronic properties in the @xmath0 differ from that in the bulk only over the finite distance from the interface ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "@xmath54 can correspond to the distance of a few @xmath0 coherence lengths . for @xmath55",
    "the electronic properties are that of the bulk superconductor . in other words , we assume that the system for @xmath55 is homogeneous .",
    "namely , for @xmath55 we have : @xmath56 as a consequence the surface green s function ( [ sgfdef ] ) is also @xmath34-independent and can be obtained from the bulk @xmath57 @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fourier transform of the green s function of the homogeneous superconductor @xmath60 , namely @xmath61 .",
    "clearly , the green s function @xmath60 for the case where the vector potential is equal to zero is given by the usual result :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the single electron energy spectrum .",
    "the homogeneity of the system for @xmath55 leads to the conclusion , that the inversion of a semi - infinite block tridiagonal matrix ( [ hinf ] ) can be reduced to the inversion of the finite tridiagonal matrix :    @xmath64    in the above equation the effect of the semi - infinite homogeneous system is contained in the embedding potential @xmath65 , which is related to the surface green s function through : @xmath66 evidently , by increasing @xmath54 until @xmath67 in the surface region does not change would constitute an exact albeit numerical solution of the eq .",
    "( [ hfg ] ) .",
    "all calculations reported here were performed for @xmath68 .",
    "however , we have checked that larger @xmath54 has no influence on the results .",
    "the calculation of the various physical quantities , like particle concentration @xmath69 , spin polarization @xmath70 , order parameter @xmath71 , etc .",
    ", needs the evaluation of integrals of the product of the green s function and fermi distribution function as in @xmath72 . while working on the real energy axis , we need a large number of integration points to get good accuracy , unless there are no singularities in the density of states",
    ". however , in our calculations , there is a van hove singularity in the @xmath11 @xmath73 as well as @xmath3-like singularities .",
    "in fact we need approximately @xmath74 - @xmath75 points to get good accuracy , which is very time - consuming in self - consistent calculations .",
    "the situation is similar for summation over the matsubara energies @xmath76 because of the poles of the fermi function .",
    "there is an infinite number of poles , and infinite sum does not always converge well , so numerical treatment needs a large number of data points .    to overcome these difficulties we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and approximate the fermi distribution function by : @xmath77 to get the correct behaviour near the fermi energy ( @xmath78 ) we choose @xmath79 .",
    "one can check , that the discrepancy between the approximate function and the true one , starts to play role for energies lower than @xmath80 .",
    "if we choose @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the half of the bandwidth , the approximation works very well . for example , for the temperature @xmath83",
    "it is sufficient to consider only @xmath84 points to get very good accuracy .",
    "the poles of the approximate function lie on a circle given by @xmath85 the solution of the above equation gives the poles in the form : @xmath86 in the limit @xmath87 , the poles ( [ polesenergy ] ) move to the matsubara energies , and the number of poles , @xmath88 , becomes infinite .",
    "the calculation of any physical quantity becomes : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is given by eq.([polesenergy ] ) .      as usual in problems of interfaces , a large number of equations has to be solved self - consistently . in our case the parameters , to be determined self - consistently at each layer @xmath34 ,",
    "are : the total electron density @xmath69 , the spin polarization @xmath70 , the @xmath0 order parameter @xmath71 , the current parallel to the interface @xmath91 and the vector potential @xmath92 .",
    "most of these quantities can be expressed in terms of the corresponding layer - diagonal elements of the green s functions @xmath93 ( see eq.([hhfg ] ) ) .",
    "the exception is the vector potential , for which we need an additional ( maxwell s ) equation .",
    "these relations are ( see eq.([oaverage ] ) ) : @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the @xmath98-th element of the matrix green s function , which is the solution of the @xmath27 equation ( eq .",
    "( [ hfg ] ) ) .",
    "the current , for spin up electrons , in the @xmath32-direction can be calculated from the relation : @xmath99 which follows from the continuity equation for the charge ( @xmath100_- = - \\sum_j j_{ij}$ ] ) .",
    "this current will give rise to a vector potential @xmath101 which will have to be used to update @xmath102 in eq.([hfg ] ) at the end of each self - consistency cycle .",
    "we calculated this new vector potential by solving numerically ampere s law , @xmath103 , which for the lattice problem at hand , is @xmath104 in all our calculations the eqs.([n])-([maxwell ] ) have been solved in each iteration step until self - consistency has been achieved .",
    "the numerical calculations have been performed at temperature @xmath83 for @xmath84 energy points , @xmath105 - @xmath36 points and @xmath106 layers ( @xmath107 ferromagnetic and @xmath107 superconducting ) .",
    "typically self - consistency , at the level of @xmath108 on all densities in eqs.([n])-([maxwell ] ) , has been achieved after @xmath109 - @xmath110 iterations .",
    "since we have determined the ferromagnetic ( [ m ] ) and superconducting ( [ delta ] ) order parameters on both sides of the interface fully self - consistently , we were able to study both @xmath0 and @xmath1 proximity effects .",
    "this means , that we were able to describe situations in which ferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist near the interface .",
    "firstly , we want to discuss the magnetic proximity effect , namely the entering of the spin polarization into the superconductor .",
    "the typical behaviour of the spin polarization ( @xmath111 ) is plotted in the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a function of the layer index @xmath34 for a number of exchange splittings @xmath112 .",
    "we can see that the spin polarization exponentially decays over the distance of the @xmath0 coherence lengths @xmath113 , which in the present case is @xmath114 in units of the lattice constant @xmath115 .",
    "we have checked this by explicit calculations of @xmath113 for various values of the superconducting energy gap .",
    "so we can conclude that effect of proximity of the ferromagnet on the superconductor is very similar to case of the meissner effect , where an external magnetic field is excluded from the sample .",
    "note however that while the magnetic field is excluded on the spatial scale of the penetration depth the effective exchange field drops to zero within the distance of the coherence length @xmath113 in the superconductor .",
    "more interesting is the behaviour of the spin polarization on the ferromagnetic side of the heterostructure . as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , it oscillates around its bulk value with period depending on the exchange splitting @xmath112 but not on the superconducting gap .",
    "however we were not able to fit the numerical points to any simple relation between parameters of the model .",
    "the best fit we have is @xmath116 . whilst this means that the period of the oscillations is a linear function of the exchange splitting the above relation is valid only for the thickness of the @xmath1 slab @xmath117 layers . for different thicknesses we have different relations and different numbers of period within the slab .",
    "for example , for @xmath118 , @xmath70 shows one period less for the corresponding exchange splittings @xmath112 .",
    "we now turn to the superconducting proximity effect , namely the leakage of the @xmath0 properties into the non - superconducting region . in our case , although @xmath119 on the ferromagnetic side , due to the fact that for @xmath120 , @xmath121 , the pairing amplitude @xmath122 can , in general , be non - zero and it usually is .",
    "the proximity effect is well understood in the case of non - magnetic metal - superconductor interface ( @xmath123/@xmath0 ) @xcite in terms of the andreev reflections @xcite .",
    "the andreev process describes a situation in which an electron impinging onto the @xmath123/@xmath0 interface is reflected back as a hole ( with opposite spin ) and a cooper pair is created in the @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the movement of the electrons and holes in the @xmath123 close to the interface ( over the distance of the @xmath0 coherence length @xmath113 ) is highly correlated .",
    "the pairing amplitude , in this case , enters the normal metal and decays exponentially over the @xmath113 .",
    "when the normal metal is replaced by a ferromagnet one might naively expect that the proximity effect will be suppressed due to the pair breaking effect of the exchange field @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the pairing amplitude @xmath124 will decay over a distance much shorter than the superconducting coherence length .",
    "remarkably , as we can see in the fig . [ fig3 ] , this is not the case .    instead , we can observe a very long range proximity effect with an oscillating pairing amplitude .",
    "this effect has been first noted by a. i. buzdin _",
    "_ @xcite and have been studied in several recent publications @xcite . according to them ,",
    "it can be attributed to a @xmath2 - like phenomena @xcite in @xmath1/@xmath0 heterostructures .",
    "the period of the oscillations of the @xmath124 depends on the exchange splitting @xmath112 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and , similarly to the oscillations of @xmath70 , does not depend on the superconducting energy gap .",
    "clearly this behaviour is different from @xmath123/@xmath0 case , where the proximity effect depends on the @xmath0 coherence length @xmath113 . here",
    ", it depends only on the properties of the ferromagnet . moreover ,",
    "the numerically obtained behaviour of the pairing amplitude @xmath124 is consistent with the analytical formula @xmath125 with @xmath126 being ferromagnetic coherence length . reassuringly",
    "this result is fully consistent with those of ref .",
    "the comparison our numerical results with the formula ( [ chi_analit ] ) for the exchange splitting @xmath127 , which gives @xmath128 is depicted in the inset of the fig .",
    "in fact we had to change @xmath129 by @xmath130 , in order to get better fit .",
    "so the solid line in the inset of the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] corresponds to the formula @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "it turns out that as exchange splitting becomes smaller the fitting to the analytical formula ( [ chi_analit ] ) becomes better .",
    "the small discrepancy in the coherence length may come from the fact , that we have used bulk value of the exchange field while calculating the coherence length .",
    "however in our system , the spin polarization oscillates around its bulk value , and if we calculate the average value of the spin polarization @xmath133 , we get a little bit smaller value than the bulk one .",
    "so , we conclude , that the effective exchange splitting @xmath134 also has to be smaller than its bulk value .",
    "indeed , when we used @xmath134 to calculate the coherence length , the agreement is improved .",
    "another reason may be the approximate form of the formula for the coherence length in the lattice case @xmath135 .",
    "the proximity effect manifests itself not only in the pairing amplitude and the spin polarization characteristics but also in the density of states ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the layer resolved @xmath73 is defined as @xmath136 with @xmath137 being the @xmath98-th element of the matrix green s function - solution of the eq .",
    "( [ hfg ] ) .",
    "we shall also use the density of states integrated over the total sample : @xmath138 .",
    "at this point we want to stress that , when we calculate thermodynamic quantities ( eq.([n])-([current ] ) ) we work on the complex energy plane , but calculating the @xmath73 we solve eq .",
    "[ hfg ] on the real energy axis only once .",
    "in fact we have added a small imaginary part ( @xmath139 ) for numerical purposes .",
    "the quantities : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath92 as determined by the previous self - consistent procedure allow us to find the green function on the real energy axis in only one step .",
    "we also check if the new quantities like @xmath69 , @xmath70 , etc . agree with the old ones . for all such calculations",
    "the agreement has been found to be excellent .",
    "while the general solution of eq.([hfg ] ) allows for a current flow , in this section we show the results for a solution for which the current has been constrained to be zero .    to appreciate the effect of spin polarization in the @xmath1 slab ,",
    "let us recall again the case of no exchange splitting .",
    "if the non - magnetic metal ( @xmath123 ) is in the contact with superconductor ( @xmath0 ) , the density of states on the @xmath123 side shows features of the @xmath0 @xmath73 , i.e. the pseudo - gap opens up around the fermi energy in the @xmath73 .",
    "however it never turns into a true gap , namely the @xmath123 @xmath73 always possess low energy excitations .",
    "moreover , the gap in the @xmath0 @xmath73 also starts to fill up , due to the proximity of the normal metal .",
    "so in this case we deal with gapless superconductivity close to interface of the @xmath123/@xmath0 heterostructure .",
    "compared to the above summary , the ferromagnet - superconductor interface is enriched with a number of new features .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0 @xmath73 splits , if the exchange field is small . for strong enough exchange field , @xmath0 gap",
    "can be suppressed , indicating transition to the non-@xmath0 ( normal ) phase .",
    "an example of the layer resolved density of states for spin up ( solid line ) and down ( dashed ) is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "evidently there is a pseudogap in the @xmath1 @xmath73 , indicating that superconducting correlations are present in the @xmath1 layers .",
    "this effect is particularly strong for the layer index @xmath140 and @xmath141 . on the other hand ,",
    "the proximity of the ferromagnet leads to existence of the low energy states in the @xmath0 @xmath73 .",
    "this effect is also observed in @xmath123/@xmath0 heterostructure but here we also notice differences in the spin up and spin down @xmath73 on the @xmath0 layers close to the interface .",
    "these are clear manifestations of the @xmath1 proximity effect .",
    "the most interesting physics of the heterostructures we consider , is the formation of andreev bound states in the @xmath123 or @xmath1 layers .",
    "they are  particle in a box  like states which can be associated with the semiclassical orbits bouncing back and forth between the @xmath0 and @xmath6 regions , as depicted in the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . as is well known in the case of @xmath123 layers the reflections at the @xmath0 are andreev ones , while those at the @xmath6 are normal reflections @xcite .",
    "the arrows in the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] point along the momenta of the particle segment of the orbit .",
    "its @xmath32 component is @xmath36 which labels the state .",
    "clearly , the collection of states labelled in this way forms an andreev band .    for the normal metal - superconductor heterostructure , andreev bound states ( bands )",
    "are symmetrically placed with respect to the fermi energy .",
    "of course the position of these states changes with the thickness of the sample . as we increase the size of the sample , the andreev bound states approach the fermi energy , but they will never reach it . in other words , there is no possibility of crossing the fermi level . somewhat surprisingly , the situation is quite different for the @xmath1/@xmath0 structure @xcite . in this case the bound state energies can cross the fermi level . in short",
    "they can become the zero - energy mid - gap states @xcite .",
    "this situation is illustrated , for @xmath142 , in the fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where the bound state energies are plotted against the exchange splitting .",
    "if we take into account states for different @xmath36 ( andreev band ) , the situation is more complicated as in general the states with different symmetry of the wave function can mix , and so we are not able to separate andreev bands so easily .",
    "the example of such andreev bands rather than states is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where the density of states of the spin up electrons is plotted for a few values of the exchange splitting .",
    "as we shall report presently the fact that the andreev bound states can cross the fermi level has remarkable consequences : it leads to the generation of the spontaneous current in the ground state .",
    "in fact the situation is rather similar to that of exotic superconductors ( with non-@xmath143-wave order parameter ) , where the surface @xmath73 shows the zero - energy state , leading to the spontaneously generated current .",
    "however the origin of this state is quite different , as there it comes from the symmetry related sign change of the order parameter at the surface @xcite . here , in the @xmath1/@xmath0 heterostructure",
    ", the zero - energy state comes from the oscillatory behaviour of the pairing amplitude ( @xmath144 ) in @xmath1 , which changes its phase by @xmath4 each time crosses zero .",
    "nevertheless it leads to the same effect : a spontaneously generated current .",
    "the most remarkable feature of our calculations is that the solution of the @xmath27 equations frequently converges to a solution with the finite current @xmath145 even though the external vector potential is zero .",
    "the generation of the spontaneous current is strictly related to the crossing of the andreev bound states through the fermi energy . in the fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we have plotted the @xmath73 for different values of the exchange splitting for calculations where the current was allowed to develop in the @xmath32 - direction . for the @xmath146 we observe that spontaneous current is generated in the ground state .",
    "we have checked that the solution with the current flowing is the true ground state , as it has energy lower than solution without the current .",
    "physically , in the presence of the current , the zero energy states split because of the momentum dependence of a @xmath147 contribution to the quasiparticle energies where the velocity vector is defined by the current @xmath148 .",
    "the example of such a doppler splitting in the @xmath73 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] for the exchange field @xmath146 .",
    "we can see that , besides the zero energy state , the other andreev states also are split .",
    "it turns out that the splitting of these states is only weakly sensitive to the exchange field @xmath112 , but it strongly depends on the thickness of the ferromagnetic slab and it decreases as the thickness increases .",
    "interestingly , we have found a simple relation between the splitting of the zero energy state @xmath149 and the vector potential @xmath92 .",
    "this is given by : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the value of the vector potential @xmath92 averaged over the @xmath1 side of the system only , i.e. @xmath152 .",
    "corresponding to the splitting of the zero energy states , when the current flows , we find differences in the @xmath73 at the fermi level .",
    "in fact , the difference is quite small .",
    "the main behaviour remains the same .",
    "the comparison of the density of states at the fermi energy for both cases ( @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",
    "the @xmath73 for the @xmath123/@xmath0 structure ( dashed line with circles ) is also drawn .",
    "as we can see , the main features remain more or less the same , in particular the period of the oscillations . similarly like the spin polarization ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and pairing amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the density of states at the fermi level shows decreasing period of the oscillations as the exchange splitting increases .",
    "as we already discussed , the zero energy state is responsible for the generation of the spontaneous current in the system .",
    "the typical example of such a current , flowing parallel to the @xmath1/@xmath0 interface , ( @xmath155 ) is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] for a few values of the exchange splitting .",
    "evidently , the behaviour of the current , as a function of the layer index , is very similar to the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "for example , if we compare the dashed curve with the triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] to the dashed or solid line with triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we readily notice the similarity in the oscillating nature of the current and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "another important issue is the distribution of the current through the whole trilayer structure .",
    "we find that it flows mostly in the positive @xmath32 direction on ferromagnetic side and in the negative direction in the superconductor .",
    "notably the total current , integrated over the whole sample , is equal to zero within numerical accuracy .",
    "this is as it should be for the true ground state and found to be in the @xmath2 state , where the current associated with the unpaired electrons is balanced by the supercurrent flowing in the opposite direction .",
    "while the total current in the system is equal to zero , the current integrated over @xmath1 side only ( @xmath156 ) has a finite value , almost independent of the exchange splitting . but that current is very sensitive to the thickness of the @xmath1 slab , and for example for @xmath157 @xmath158 ( @xmath159 per layer ) , while for @xmath160 we have @xmath161 ( @xmath162 per layer ) .",
    "this suggests that effect associated with the spontaneous current is very important in the samples of the small thicknesses and it seems to play minor role if the size of @xmath1 part of the system is large .",
    "obviously , the above current distribution should lead to the generation of the magnetic flux through the sample .",
    "in fact we have found that again , as the current , the magnetic flux bounded by the layers only weakly depends on the exchange splitting but it does change with the distance from the interface . for @xmath157",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath163 is nearly equal to the half of the flux quantum @xmath164 , @xmath165 .",
    "this gives a flux per plaquette , associated with the layers @xmath34 and @xmath166 , @xmath167 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath160 we have @xmath168 and @xmath169 respectively .",
    "the typical layer dependence of the spontaneous magnetic flux @xmath170 ( magnetic flux through a plaquette ) is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "we can see that while there are small differences in the behaviour on the @xmath1 and @xmath0 sides of the sample , related to the different current distributions ( see the fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) , the total magnetic flux @xmath171 is roughly the same and more or less independent of the exchange splitting .",
    "as we have recalled above , in the bulk @xmath2 state the total current vanishes . moreover , the quasiparticle current @xmath172 is exactly equal to the supercurrent @xmath173 ( related to the @xmath174 in eq .",
    "( [ hfg ] ) ) with opposite sign .",
    "this means that in a bulk layered superconductor , these two currents cancel each other layer by layer , i.e. @xmath175 .",
    "evidently this is the case because the exchange field and superconducting pairing potential are present in the whole system .",
    "by contrast , in the case of the @xmath1/@xmath0 heterostructure , the exchange field and the pairing potential are spatially separated . in this case",
    "@xmath176 is not equal to @xmath177 within each layer , but it is when integrated over the whole sample , i. e. @xmath178 thus the lack of exact cancellation of the current layer by layer leads to a finite current on both sides of the interface , but zero in the whole sample .",
    "an example of such behaviour is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "we see , that the quasiparticle part of the total current ( solid line ) is almost in anti - phase to the supercurrent ( dashed line ) .",
    "moreover , on the superconducting side , the current is carried mainly by quasiparticles .",
    "this is rather surprising since usually one expects current to be related to the cooper pairs .",
    "however due to the proximity of the ferromagnet , there are also  normal  particles in the superconductor near the interface .",
    "these certainly contribute to the total current , like in the bulk @xmath2 state . in our system , only the cooper pairs close to the interface can feel the exchange field of the ferromagnet and have moving center of mass . note that magnetization goes to zero very quickly as we go away from the interface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "clearly this makes the supercurrent equal to zero except within a few @xmath0 layers .",
    "interestingly we also found that whenever the pairing amplitude @xmath124 changes sign , the local quasiparticle current as well as the local supercurrent becomes large .",
    "in other words , the maxima of the @xmath176 and @xmath179 correspond to the zeros of the pairing amplitude @xmath124 .",
    "as we have mentioned above , the ground state does not carry current for all values of the exchange splitting .",
    "we have shown , that whenever there is a current flowing , there are the andreev bound states crossing the fermi level .",
    "also we have found another quantity which is related to the current flowing .",
    "namely , the pairing amplitude at the @xmath1/@xmath6 interface ( i.e. @xmath180 - see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath181 changes its sign , the spontaneous current is generated .",
    "this happens exactly for the same values of the exchange splitting , for which a band of the andreev bound states crosses the fermi energy .",
    "moreover , the presence or absence of the current has a dramatic effect on the pairing amplitude @xmath181 .",
    "this can be seen in the fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , where @xmath181 is plotted as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath182 .    as implied by eq.[delta ]",
    ", @xmath124 is the real part of a complex order parameter which has an amplitude @xmath183 and a phase @xmath184 . clearly , fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] can be red as @xmath185 flipping from @xmath186 where @xmath181 has the same sign as @xmath144 in @xmath0 , to @xmath187 , where @xmath181 has the opposite sign .",
    "evidently , the pairing amplitude is pinned to zero by the spontaneous current in the system . introducing the dimensionless quantity @xmath188 we can say , that system is in a @xmath4-like phase ( for odd @xmath188 ) or in the @xmath17-phase ( even @xmath188 ) , in close analogy to studies on the @xmath4-effect in the @xmath0/@xmath1/@xmath0 structure by chtchelkatchev et al .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown a similar picture for the thickness of the @xmath1 slab equal to @xmath189 layers . here we show the corresponding results for @xmath190 layers . to be precise in the present case",
    "@xmath188 has slightly different value with prefactor @xmath191 ( not @xmath192 as it was for @xmath189 layers case ) .",
    "this discrepancy may come from the fact , that effective exchange splitting is little bit smaller than its bulk value ( see discussion in the paragraph [ subsec3.a ] ) .      as our system consists of ferromagnet and superconductor",
    ", we can expect the spontaneous current to be polarized .",
    "however , up to now , we have presented results for the special case of the particle - hole symmetry ( @xmath193 or @xmath194 ) and we found that the spontaneous current was , in fact , not spin - polarized .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "within linear response theory , the total current can be divided into two parts : a diamagnetic one - giving the response of the bulk density , and a paramagnetic one , which is proportional to the density of states at the fermi energy , as it comes from the deformation of the wave function at the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "now if we note , that for the particle - hole symmetric case ( @xmath193 ) , the spin up @xmath195 and spin down @xmath196 @xmath73 at the fermi energy are equal , we are not surprised that the polarization of the current is equal to zero . as we go away from the half filling , the difference between spin up and spin down @xmath73 ( @xmath197 starts to play a role as it leads to the polarization of the current .",
    "a typical example of the polarization of the current @xmath198 is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] for concentration of electrons @xmath199 and @xmath200 .    to make the two calculations comparable",
    "we have adjusted the parameters so the value of the @xmath0 order parameter would be the same .",
    "this was achieved by shifting of the coupling constant @xmath201 to @xmath202 for @xmath203 , @xmath204 for @xmath205 as well as chemical potential to @xmath206 and @xmath207 respectively .",
    "the total polarization of the current @xmath208 is of order @xmath209 and does not depend much on the concentration of electrons @xmath210 .",
    "moreover , we have found a very interesting property of this current , namely , the sign of the polarization of the current depends on whether @xmath211 or @xmath212 .",
    "this means , that for @xmath213 we get the same results as for @xmath214 , except of the sign of the polarization of the current .",
    "this effect can be explained very easily if we recall that polarization of the current is proportional to the difference in the @xmath73 at the fermi energy , and one can check , that @xmath215 is an antisymmetric function under the shift @xmath216 , i.e. @xmath217 .",
    "clearly , the important issue raised by the above results is `` how to observe experimentally the predicted current ? '' but first of all let s estimate how big this current is . if we assume a bandwidth equal to @xmath218 , the average current per layer is of order of tenths of @xmath219 . in general the polarization of the ferromagnet",
    "can be large , however it can not be equal to @xmath220 .",
    "there must be a small number of the minority electrons .",
    "in other words it does nt matter how big the ratio @xmath221 is , we should always observe the current .",
    "the next point is the thickness of the @xmath1 region .",
    "namely , the current is bigger for a thinner sample , but even for thickness of order of several hundreds of @xmath129 , we expect the current to be easily detectable",
    ".    clearly , the presence of the current should manifest itself in a number of experiments .",
    "for example , since there is a net magnetic flux associated with the current , it could be detected by @xmath222 experiments .",
    "another possibility is to measure the conductance across the @xmath1/@xmath0 junction @xcite . in such experiments",
    "the splitting of the zero energy state in the @xmath73 is expected to be observed and , as indicated by eq.[splitting ] the energy distance between the split peaks measures the current flowing .",
    "finally one can also use some local probes like @xmath223 techniques to measure the layer resolved @xmath73 .    confirming that the current is polarized is more troublesome .",
    "as we have shown , to get polarized current the system has to be away from the @xmath193 point . in our case , to avoid a fermi energy mismatch , both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 are moved from @xmath193 .",
    "fortunately , this is only necessary for the ferromagnet .",
    "the superconductor can be in a particle - hole symmetric state . in short ,",
    "realistic estimations of the spin polarization of the spontaneous current require more material specific calculations .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied properties of the insulator ( or vacuum ) - ferromagnet - superconductor trilayer .",
    "we have shown , that such a structure supports andreev bound states forming andreev bands , whose position can be tuned by thickness of the sample or exchange splitting . moreover ,",
    "when a band crosses the fermi energy , a spontaneous current ( and magnetic flux ) is generated in the ground state . we have found a relation between the pairing amplitude in the ferromagnet , which has oscillatory behaviour , and the andreev bound states .",
    "namely , when the andreev band crosses the fermi energy the pairing amplitude at the surface opposite to the @xmath1/@xmath0 interface changes sign , and as long as current flows it is pinned to zero .",
    "the polarization of the current strongly depends on the band filling and is related to the difference in the spin up and spin down density of states at the fermi level .",
    "we also have discussed the question of the supercurrent vs quasiparticle current and gave some experimental clues on how to observe that current .",
    "the presented results can be , and we have argued that they are , attributed to the @xmath2 effect influenced andreev bound states and can be verified experimentally .",
