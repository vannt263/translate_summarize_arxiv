    "in anomalously diffusing systems , a mean - square displacement scales with time according to a power law , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 ( superdiffusion ) or @xmath2 ( subdiffusion ) .",
    "( the case @xmath3 corresponds to normal diffusion . )",
    "anomalous diffusion has been observed in systems as widely varied as plasma flow@xcite , surface growth@xcite , and financial markets@xcite .",
    "a general framework for treating superdiffusive systems is provided by the nonlinear fokker - planck equation , which is associated with an underlying ito - langevin process@xcite .",
    "this in turn has a very interesting connection to the nonextensive entropy proposed by tsallis@xcite : the nonlinear fokker - planck equation is solved by time - dependent distributions which maximize the tsallis entropy@xcite .",
    "this unexpected connection between thermostatistics and anomalous diffusion gives an entirely new way to approach the study of dynamics of anomalously diffusing systems . in this paper",
    "we use this viewpoint to address the dynamics of financial markets .",
    "several financial markets indices as well as their member stocks are characterized by price changes whose variances have been shown to undergo anomalous ( super ) diffusion under time evolution@xcite . moreover , the probability distributions of the price changes have power law tails@xcite .",
    "an open long - term question is how best to describe these distributions and their time evolution .",
    "earlier work has shown that the power - law tails can be described by a distribution which maximizes the tsallis entropy@xcite .",
    "the connection mentioned above then suggests that the market dynamics might be controlled by a nonlinear fokker - planck equation . in this description",
    "the power - law tails and the anomalous diffusion arise together quite naturally . here",
    "we show that this approach seems to accurately describe high - frequency intra - day price changes for the s&p500 index",
    ". it may also be suitable to describe the superdiffusion and power law behaviors observed in a broad range of markets and exchanges@xcite .",
    "the description we will use was developed in the general context of anomalously diffusing systems by tsallis and bukman@xcite and zanette@xcite .",
    "here we briefly summarize their results , which are based on a maximization of entropy subject to certain constraints .",
    "the central ingredient is a time - dependent probability distribution @xmath4 of a stochastic variable @xmath5 .",
    "the point of departure from normal maximum entropy approaches is the feature that the entropy used is the non - extensive tsallis entropy , @xmath6 the tsallis parameter @xmath7 characterizes the non - extensivity of the entropy . in the limit @xmath8",
    "the entropy becomes the usual logarithmic expression s=-@xmath9 .",
    "associated with the non - extensive entropy is the use of the constraints @xmath10p(x , t)^{q}% \\,dx=0,\\label{mean}\\\\ & & \\langle(x-\\bar{x}(t))^{2}\\rangle_{q}\\equiv\\int[x-\\bar{x}(t)]^{2}% p(x , t)^{q}\\,dx=\\sigma_{q}(t)^{2}.\\label{constraints}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first of these is simply the normalization of the probability . however , in the latter two equations the probability distribution function is raised to the power @xmath7 .",
    "unless @xmath11 these are not the usual constraints leading to the mean and variance , and @xmath12 ( the ` @xmath7-variance ' ) is not the ordinary variance .",
    "notice that the tsallis nonextensivity parameter @xmath7 is independent of time .    maximizing the tsallis entropy subject to these constraints , for fixed @xmath7 , yields@xcite @xmath13^{2}\\right\\ } ^{-\\frac{1}{q-1}}.\\label{pdf}\\ ] ] here parameters @xmath14 ( a normalization constant ) and @xmath15 are lagrange multipliers associated with the first and third constraints , and are given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is euler s beta function .    the ordinary variance of the distribution eq .",

    "( [ pdf ] ) can be viewed as a _ least biased _ probability distribution compatible with observed stochastic data with a certain mean @xmath20 and variance @xmath21 ( but with a particular choice of @xmath7 ) .",
    "an important property of the probability distribution function eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) is that , with appropriate time - dependent parameters , it is the solution of a time evolution equation which leads naturally to anomalous diffusion@xcite . consider the nonlinear fokker - planck equation @xmath22   + \\frac{d}{2}{\\frac{\\partial^{2}p(x , t)^{\\nu}% } { \\partial x^{2}}},\\label{fokker}%\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a linear drift force , @xmath24 .",
    "one can show@xcite that a function of the form eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) solves this as long as @xmath25 and the time dependences of the parameters are given by @xmath26 by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ znorm ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) one easily shows that the nonlinear fokker - planck equation preserves the norm ( @xmath27 ) only if @xmath28 .",

    "( [ znorm ] ) .",
    "it is apparent from the results sketched in the previous section that the tsallis probability distribution function @xmath4 has properties which make it a good candidate for describing the anomalous diffusion of financial market indices , member stocks , and currency exchanges .",
    "first , in the large @xmath5 limit @xmath4 becomes a power law distribution , @xmath31 this is in keeping with the observed power law tails in market distributions and , indeed , certain market distributions have been well fit by a distribution of the tsallis form@xcite .",
    "in fact this fit to market data has a longer history  the tsallis function is an extension to continuous values of @xmath7 of the student-@xmath32 distribution , which has been known for some time to provide a good fit to certain market data@xcite .",
    "what has not been widely recognized in the finance - related applications of statistics is that the tsallis distribution solves the nonlinear fokker - planck equation .",
    "consequently it may provide a framework for understanding the dynamics of certain market data , including anomalous diffusion .",
    "it is this possibility that we will now discuss .    for application to market indices",
    "the tsallis parameter @xmath7 must lie within the range eq .",
    "( [ qrange ] ) , ensuring that the regular variance remains finite and evolves for moderately long times as @xmath33 [ using eq .",
    "( [ variance],[betat ] ) in the case @xmath34 .",
    "thus the fokker - planck equation can describe superdiffusive processes ( with @xmath35 ) .    here",
    "we investigate one test case , the s&p500 stock market index , using fairly high - frequency 1-minute - interval data collected from july 2000 to january 2001 .",
    "this data consists of a set of prices ( index values ) @xmath36 at discrete times @xmath37 ( @xmath38 trading minutes ) obtained from the terra - lycos qcharts server@xcite .",
    "( the time period chosen has no special significance . )",
    "the quantity amenable to a stochastic analysis of the ito - langevin type is the price change during various time intervals@xcite . to agree with the notation used in the previous section we define @xmath5 to be a price change during a time interval @xmath32 . for each fixed time interval @xmath32",
    "we generate a sequence of non - overlapping price changes @xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",
    "we view the data thus generated for each fixed time interval @xmath32 as a sample selected from a population with some distribution @xmath41 .",
    "thus in this application the presumably stochastic variable @xmath5 is a price change , and the ` time ' variable @xmath32 is really the corresponding time interval .",
    "anomalous diffusion occurs in random systems with correlations in time .",
    "because the price change during a longer interval is a sum of price changes during shorter intervals , one has @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a conditional probability . in the absence of correlation ,",
    "price changes in different intervals are independent , so that @xmath44 . in this case",
    "it is easy to see that the variance grows linearly with time .",
    "anomalous diffusion thus means that price changes during successive time intervals are not independent  naturally enough , since traders respond to earlier changes .",
    "the observed superdiffusion of financial markets thus indicates correlation , and consequently a nontrivial time dependence .",
    "autocorrelation analyses of the s&p500 market have found strong correlations for times on the order of a few minutes , with weak persistent correlations at longer times@xcite .",
    "we find the same for our data set .",
    "consequently in this work we will concentrate on the intra - day market dynamics of intervals less than one hour ( 1 min @xmath45 60 min ) .",
    "if the dynamics are of fokker - planck form , then there must be a consistency between the distribution @xmath41 at a certain time @xmath32 and the way the distributions evolve in time .",
    "one would have to find that the data at different times can be fit by distributions of tsallis form , with a tsallis parameter @xmath7 independent of time .",
    "if so , then the variance will evolve in time according to eq .",
    "( [ variance],[betat ] ) with the same @xmath7 and appropriate values for @xmath46 .",
    "we investigate the degree to which the s&p500 price changes at different time intervals @xmath32 can be described by a tsallis distribution evolving according to a fokker - planck equation .",
    "the approach is to bin the data and perform a direct nonlinear @xmath47 fit of eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) .",
    "the ` initial ' distribution corresponds to the shortest value of @xmath32 , here @xmath48 minute .",
    "the @xmath49 price changes and a fit of tsallis form are shown in fig .",
    "the fit parameters are @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and consequently [ from eq .",
    "( [ znorm ] ) ] @xmath52 .",
    "we then fit the data at different time intervals @xmath32 , with the tsallis parameter @xmath53 fixed and @xmath54 determined by the fit .",
    "it is important to this analysis that the data at all times continues to be well fit by the tsallis distribution , and indeed this is what we find .",

    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ betafig ] that the agreement is quite good , indicating time evolution of nonlinear fokker - planck form .    as a check on our analysis we also generated simulated data using a tsallis distribution eq .",

    "( [ z],[betat ] ) .",
    "we then performed the same analysis that we performed on the s&p500 data .",
    "briefly , the approach is as follows .",
    "we use the parameters @xmath57 and initial values @xmath58 obtained from the s&p500 data .",

    "the resulting @xmath5 s are distributed according to the tsallis form , eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) .",
    "thus the simulated price - change data is guaranteed to have a tsallis distribution evolving in time according to the fokker - planck equation .",
