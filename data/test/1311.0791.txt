    "in order to be able to use the introduced model , one has to be careful if the nonlinear conversion oscillates another pp mode which is resolvable from the first one .    in some nonlinear conversion processes ( e.g. enhanced raman scattering @xcite )",
    ", both the drive ( @xmath6 ) and the generated ( @xmath126 ) frequencies may excite the same pp mode ( @xmath14 ) .",

    "fig . 5 in ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that polarization cancellation emerges at @xmath130 for the coupled mnp - quantum oscillator system",
    ". however , enhancement of the nonlinearities depends on the physics of the conversion mechanism .",
    "fano resonances induced in coupled classical / quantum oscillators follow from a common mechanism .",
    "coupling of the resonant excitation to an auxiliary mode ( qd in our case ) introduces two possible absorption paths .",
    "the two paths counteract and avoid the excitation ( hence polarization and absorption ) at the resonance @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism is also responsible for the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite in 3-level atoms .",
    "path interference effect can reveal itself in a variety of systems .",
    "therefore , a classification of such coupled systems becomes necessary , for the purpose of illuminating the possible extensions of the nonlinearity enhancement to other systems .",
    "the first class can be defined as follows .",
    "a classical / quantum oscillator can be coupled to a classical or quantum object . here , the word _ coupling",
    "_ implies an interaction which does not yield a strong hybridization that can change the entire spectrum severely . in other words ,",
    "the splitting in the plasmon mode ( which has a wide spectral width ) is below the resolution limit .",
    "this class contains the following examples .",
    "( i ) a mnp attached with a molecule / qd , ( ii ) a molecule exhibiting nonlinear response attached to a qd @xcite , or ( iii ) two weakly interacting mnps ( e.g. distance between two mnps is relatively long or a dielectric is placed in between ) .",
    "the second class is closer , in physical aspects , to the standard eit .",
    "coupling is strong enough to completely modify the spectrum , e.g. two closely placed hybridized mnps ( dimer ) . in this case , too , fano resonance can be induced if the bright ( dipole - like ) and dark ( higher orders ) modes overlap spectrally @xcite and spatially i.e . overlap integral for the interaction hamiltonian does not vanish ( similar to ref .",
    "this is a single system whose internal states interact . in this respect , this class is analog of eit .",
    "the difference is ; in eit , the third level ( dipole - forbidden transition ) first level is the ground state , second is the dipole - allowed excited state is coupled externally with the excited level using a microwave drive @xcite . in the plasmonic analog ,",
    "coupling between the two excitations arises naturally due to the spectral overlap , which is absent in 3-level atoms .",
    "it is well demonstrated that the presence of a quantum oscillator , with a smaller decay rate , changes the optical response of mnps dramatically . due to the destructive interference of the ( hybridized ) absorption paths",
    ", mnp can not be polarized at the resonance frequency of the quantum oscillator .",
    "we demonstrate that a similar path interference effect can be adopted to both suppress and enhance the nonlinear conversion processes in a mnp dimer .",
    "a quantum oscillator is placed in the center of two hybridized mnps where hot - spot of both plasmon - polariton mode emerges .",
    "if the quantum oscillator is resonant to the second or third harmonic frequency , ( e.g. @xmath12 ) , this frequency conversion process is suppressed several orders of magnitude . because , eit does not allow the excitation of the @xmath7 oscillation in the second plasmon - polariton mode of the dimer ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the similar interference effects can be used also to enhance the nonlinear frequency conversion .",
    "the level spacing of the quantum oscillator can be arranged @xcite so that the nonresonant [ e.g. ( @xmath13 ) ] terms cancel .",
    "it is worth noting that emergence of the enhancement phenomenon does not require coupling to a high - quality oscillator .",
    "a small decay rate ( @xmath2 ) is not necessary for nonresonant terms to cancel in eq .",
    "( [ eqcond ] ) .",
    "hence , the effect can readily be observed also for two coupled low - quality mnps , if one chooses the resonances of the nanoparticles properly .",
    "we compare the predictions of our simple model with 3d mnpbem simulations which are based on the exact ( computational ) calculations of the maxwell equations .",
    "we show that our model successfully predicts the emergence of the shg enhancement as well as its position in the spectrum .",
    "we present our method for the engineering of shg process .",
    "however , the method can be used also for other nonlinear frequency generation processes .",
    "this happens as long as the converted frequency falls in the range of a different plasmon - polariton mode .",
    "contrary to the enhancement case , suppression phenomenon is independent of the conversion mechanism .",
    "if a quantum oscillator resonant to the generated frequency is coupled to the mnp system , the conversion process is prohibited .",
    "hence , it can be used to suppress undesired raman scattering processes which cause loses in the signal strength .",
