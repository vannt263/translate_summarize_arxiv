    "this is because that the hole gap in the case ( i ) is much smaller than the case ( ii ) .",
    "consequently , the hole excitations play more significant role in suppressing the quantum critical scaling behavior in the former case .",
    "this result is consistent with the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we turn to the case with non - zero @xmath317 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the @xmath317-term plays the role of chemical potential for holes in the @xmath8 qim  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the energy of a @xmath42-hole sector with finite @xmath317 is related to that with @xmath318 by the following relationship [ @xmath319 : @xmath320 thus , with finite @xmath317 , the fermion excitation spectra remain unchanged , but the hole excitation gap becomes@xcite @xmath321     for @xmath318 or @xmath322 . other parameters are @xmath195 , @xmath282 , and @xmath283 . ]    therefore , the ground state depends strongly on the value of @xmath317 . when @xmath323 , the hole excitation is positive , and the ground state is still in the @xmath51-sector .",
    "but when @xmath324 , the hole excitation gap is negative .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath51 sector is no longer the lowest energy state and there are holes in the ground state . as a result ,",

    ", the ground state is in the @xmath328 sector and all sites are occupied by holes@xcite .",
    "this can be also seen clearly from fig .",
    "[ fig : dimerhole2 ] , where the temperature dependence of the hole concentration @xmath274 is shown .",
    "we find that in the zero temperature limit , @xmath274 is equal to 1 when @xmath329 or 0 when @xmath330 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied a class of exactly solvable @xmath8 qims with single - ion anisotropy .",
    "they exhibit a hierarchy of the band structure with both fermionic and hole excitations .",
    "the hole excitation gap can be tuned by the longitudinal crystal field @xmath317 .",
    "it becomes zero when @xmath331 is equal to @xmath332 .",
    "the ground state exhibits three distinct phases : the magnetically ordered or disordered phases when @xmath333 , or the hole condensation phase when @xmath334 .",
    "the transition to the hole condensation phase is of the first order .",
    "we have shown that dimerization does not destroy the exact solvability of this model . to our knowledge , this is the first example in dimerized @xmath8 quantum spin systems where all the eigen states as well as the wavefunctions and the eigen energies can be solved exactly .",
    "the hole excitations enhance the thermodynamic fluctuations as evidenced in the specific heat which shows a sharp peak in the low - temperature region where the hole excitations proliferate .",
    "this strongly reduces the characteristic temperature below which the quantum criticality persists .",
    "all these results are robust against the dimerization .",
    "however , dimerization deforms the phase diagram and affects the high energy behavior .",
    "we have developed a recursion method to sum over all hole configurations efficiently .",

    "the recursion method holds not just for the model studied here .",
