    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are a diverse group of short - period binaries in which a late - type , roche - lobe filling secondary star transfers matter through an accretion disk onto a white dwarf primary .",
    "the standard paradigm for the formation of cvs postulates that they start out as wide binaries ( on the order of 1 au ) , of moderate orbital period ( @xmath5 1 yr ) . as the more massive component ,",
    "the white dwarf progenitor , evolves off of the main sequence , the secondary star suddenly finds itself orbiting within the red giant photosphere . during this `` common envelope '' ( ce ) phase ,",
    "much of the angular momentum of the binary is believed to be shed due to interactions of the secondary star with the atmosphere of the red giant . during this process",
    ", the binary period gets shortened , and the red giant envelope gets ejected . depending on the input parameters used in standard ce models ,",
    "between 50 and 90% of all of these close binary stars merge ( c.f . , politano & weiler 2007 ) .",
    "after emerging from the ce phase , an epoch of angular momentum loss via magnetic braking ( verbunt & zwaan 1981 ) , lasting @xmath6 10@xmath7 yr ( warner 1995 ) , is then required that leads to the formation of a semi - detached binary , and the mass transfer phase that signals the birth of a cv .    in this scenario , the vast majority of cv secondary stars should not show any signs of evolution , as there just has not been sufficient time for the low mass secondary stars ( m@xmath8 @xmath9 1 m@xmath10 ) in these systems to have begun to evolve off of the main sequence .",
    "thus , the composition of the secondary stars should be relatively normal unless they have accreted matter with an unusual composition during the ce phase , or perhaps during classical novae eruptions . in an infrared spectroscopic survey of cvs , harrison et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 ) found that the co features of the secondary stars in a number of cvs were much weaker than expected for their spectral types .",
    "for u gem , the co features were extremely weak , yet the water vapor feature was normal for a spectral type of m4v .",
    "this suggested a deficit of carbon .",
    "hamilton et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have tabulated the list of cvs with weaker than expected co features , and show that , when such data exists , analysis of uv spectra _ also _ find evidence for carbon deficiencies .",
    "one issue with the infrared spectroscopy surveys was that they were qualitative , and were derived from lower resolution ( r @xmath0 2000 ) spectroscopy .",
    "the line features in those spectra _",
    "might _ be compromised due to veiling by a continuum source that arises from the accretion disk .",
    "we have obtained moderate , and lower resolution , @xmath1-band spectroscopy of three of the brightest cvs : ss cyg , ru peg , and gk per .",
    "previous near - infrared spectroscopy with spex ( harrison et al . 2004 , 2007 ) revealed that the secondary stars in these three systems had weaker than expected co features . in the following ,",
    "we use a modified version of the moog spectral synthesis program to model moderate resolution @xmath1-band spectra to examine the atomic and molecular abundances in their secondary stars . as shown in hamilton et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , higher resolution spectra dramatically reduce the effects of accretion disk veiling , allowing us to see secondary stars even in cv systems where the accretion luminosity totally dominates that of the secondary star . in the systems discussed here , however , the secondary star dominates the accretion disk flux in the @xmath1-band , and any veiling has to be quite small .",
    "we then compare the best fit model spectra derived from the higher resolution data to lower resolution data .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the data to be modeled , in section 3 we discuss the spectral synthesis procedure , in section 4 we present the modeling of the data , discuss the results in section 5 and draw our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "ss cyg , ru peg , and gk per were observed using nirspec in high resolution mode on keck ii on 2004 august 28 .",
    "the 0.432 x 12  slit was used providing a resolving power of r @xmath0 25000 , or a velocity resolution of @xmath11 @xmath0 12 km s@xmath12 .",
    "we employed the two - nod script , and we used five minute exposure times for the three program cvs . to completely cover the @xmath1-band using nirspec requires two grating settings . due to time limitations , however , we only obtained data at a single grating position chosen to insure coverage of the first overtone bandhead of @xmath13co@xmath14 at 2.294 @xmath15 m .",
    "this grating setting also covers the @xmath13co@xmath16 bandhead at 2.383 @xmath15 m .",
    "in addition to the three program cvs , we also observed two late - type stars , @xmath17 eri ( k2v ) and @xmath18 psc ( g9iii ) , to provide templates for our synthetic spectral program given that the properties of those two objects are well known .",
    "to correct for telluric absorption , we observed bright a0v stars located close to the program objects so as to minimize their relative differences in airmass .",
    "these data were reduced using the idl routine `` @xmath19 '' , specially developed for nirspec package can be found here : http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/nirspec/redspec/index.html ] . in the @xmath1-band ,",
    "the spectra of a0v stars are nearly featureless , except for the prominent h i brackett @xmath18 feature at 2.16 @xmath15 m .",
    "the @xmath19 package does not attempt to correct for this feature , but can interpolate across such lines to reduce their impact upon division into the program star spectrum .",
    "note that there is a weak telluric feature located very close to the brackett @xmath18 line , and thus the h i line profiles in spectra produced by the division of a `` patched '' a - star spectrum are slightly compromised .    just prior to our observing run on keck",
    ", we observed the three program cvs using spex at the irtf on 2004 august 15 .",
    "spex was used in cross - dispersed mode generating spectra spanning the range from 0.8 to 2.45 @xmath15 m . in the @xmath1-band ,",
    "the dispersion is 5.4  / pix .",
    "the raw data were reduced using spextool ( cushing et al . 2004 ) .",
    "a log of all of our observations is presented in table 1 , and includes the orbital phase at the mid - point of the observational sequence for each of the three cvs .",
    "the aavso light curve data base shows that ss cyg was in quiescence at the time of both the spex and nirspec observations , having reached visual maximum on 17 july .",
    "ru peg was in outburst on 23 july , but was in quiescence for both observing runs . at the time of the infrared observations , gk per had @xmath20 = 13.1 , its normal minimum light value .",
    "to calculate a synthetic spectrum , three basic building blocks are required : a stellar atmosphere model , a list of atomic and molecular lines , and a tool to calculate the corresponding flux at the stellar surface as a function of wavelength .",
    "a full description of the modified version of moog and the grid generation and spectral matching python code ( called `` _ kmoog _ '' ) used below is described in hamilton ( 2013 ) , here we highlight the most important aspects .",
    "there are several groups that provide precomputed atmosphere models , each with their own slightly different assumptions , simplifications , and basic input physics .",
    "most of the models in general circulation , however , have the same underlying assumptions : the atmosphere is either modeled as a series of plane - parallel slabs ( 1d ) , or as a series of concentric shells ( 2d ) . the 1d and 2d atmosphere models",
    "are calculated assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) conditions , in which one temperature can describe the particle velocity distribution as well as the population of atomic levels and ionization states around a given point in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "it is also assumed that the atmosphere is time invariant , with the effects of dynamical processes such as mixing and convection parameterized .",
    "bonifacio et al .",
    "( 2012 ) provide an overview of the more detailed assumptions and differences between the available atmosphere computation methods and programs .",
    "full 3d ( radiation - hydrodynamic ) stellar atmosphere models have been calculated across parameter grids ( e.g. , ludwig et al .",
    "2009 , hauschildt and baron 2010 , magic et al .",
    "2013a , 2013b ) . for this program ,",
    "however , we have only used the 1d and 2d models .",
    "the most commonly used atmosphere model codes are phoenix ( hauschildt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , allard et al .",
    "2011 ) , marcs ( gustafsson et al . 1975 , 2008 ) , and atlas ( sbordone et al . 2004 ) .",
    "phoenix is perhaps the most computationally sophisticated , sampling 42 million atomic and 550 million molecular lines when calculating opacity .",
    "marcs model atmospheres are consistently updated through a web interface providing both 1d and 2d models . ultimately for this project",
    ", we chose to use marcs atmospheres .",
    "an important consideration for this choice was the existence of the interpolation code to create subgrid models , making it much simpler to construct a large grid of models quickly .",
    "very recently , mszros et al .",
    "( 2012 ) presented a new grid of atmospheres based off of atlas and marcs codes with an updated h@xmath21o line list as well as finer grid spacings in temperature , gravity , metallicity , and c and @xmath22 abundances .",
    "given their recent availability , however , all analyses and spectra computed here use solely the original marcs grid .",
    "the next crucial step to constructing a synthetic spectrum is to assemble a list of atomic and molecular transitions for which you wish to calculate an opacity at the stellar surface .",
    "for our project we used the atlas line list with the addition of the co line list by goorvitch ( 1994 ) .",
    "each line list was converted into a common format before combining , and , in the case of the co line list , only lines with @xmath23 and 2.28 @xmath24 2.405 @xmath15 m were kept .",
    "the final list contains a total of 11,681 lines . for the purposes of this work , only computations involving diatomic molecules",
    "were considered .",
    "this eliminates lines of the important molecular species for the cooler m dwarfs commonly found in cvs , such as h@xmath21o . as described below , synthetic spectra for the sun and arcturus",
    "were generated and compared to observations to provide the initial validation of this line list .",
    "there are a number of codes that can readily make use of marcs and kurucz atmospheres .",
    "moogchris / moog.html ] ( sneden 1973 ) has one of the longest track records , and given its ubiquity , we chose it to compute the synthetic spectra for this work . when creating a spectrum , moog",
    "is internally limited to considering only 2500 lines in the line list . given the size of our line list , we modified moog ( see hamilton 2013 ) to allow for lists of 250,000 lines .",
    "two additional changes were made to the moog source code .",
    "first , a version was created to produce absolutely no output to the screen .",
    "this prevents unnecessary lag and slowdowns , as well as greatly enhances usability when running a large number of models simultaneously .",
    "second , and most importantly , a new binary output file type of moog was created .",
    "significant savings in storage size were realized by creating a true fits output type , reducing the file size of a successfully created model by a factor of five or more .",
    "the fits files created also have the benefit of being fully compliant and compatible with the standard cfitsio libraries , unlike the fits - like output already in the code .",
    "the fits output created also has the benefit of storing both a full resolution spectrum as well as one convolved to lower resolutions , useful for quickly comparing against observations from different telescopes and instruments .      to validate our line list , we constructed synthetic spectra for the sun ( using the solar marcs model ) and arcturus ( using the parameters listed in table 2 , but with log@xmath25 = 3.0 ) to compare them to high resolution @xmath1-band spectra published by wallace et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and wallace & hinkle ( 1996 ) .",
    "we concentrated on the reproduction of only the strongest spectral features observed in these two objects .",
    "note that the arcturus comparison was only used to insure that we were not missing lines that become important at lower temperatures .",
    "we then altered the oscillator strengths of the most highly discrepant lines to insure that they would both fit the observations better , and not bias the automated fitting process .",
    "for example , there were a large number of sc i transitions that had oscillator strengths that were much too large .",
    "unfortunately , oscillator strengths for many of the transitions in the @xmath1-band do not appear in the nist atomic spectra database , and thus we used trial and error adjustment of the tabulated oscillator strength in the line list to better reproduce the observed spectral feature ( for a primer on the identification of the strongest spectral features found in the @xmath1-band for k - type stars , see fig . 5 in harrison et al .",
    "2004 ) .    to test our ability to reproduce observations ,",
    "we have constructed synthetic spectra to compare to the nirspec observations of @xmath17 eri and @xmath18 psc , and to a sample lower resolution spectra of k dwarfs contained in the irtf spectral library ( cushing et al .",
    "we summarize the spectroscopically derived parameters for these objects in table 2 , averaging the data compiled in the pastel catalog ( soubiran et al .",
    "2010 ) for each object , constrained to measures made after 1970 .",
    "the final column of table 2 denotes how many unique measurements went into the determination of each of the average properties for each star ( note that hd45977 only has a single measurement of its characteristics by sousa et al .",
    "as we will see , this sample more than spans the range in metallicity observed for our program cvs .",
    "note that the solar abundance pattern derived by grevesse et al .",
    "( 2007 ) was used for all of the synthetic spectra , and only the abundance of carbon was altered for the investigation of the cvs .    in preparation for comparison to the models ,",
    "the spectra were continuum normalized using a third order polynomial fit in iraf .",
    "for the high resolution spectra , the process was quite trivial . for the full @xmath1-band spectra , however , we used an identical set of wavelength bins for identifying the continuum to be fit .",
    "the continua were then fitted over the range 2.08 to 2.29 @xmath15 m , with bins that avoided all of the strongest spectral features .",
    "the nirspec spectrum of @xmath17 eri is presented in fig . [ eps ] , where data for five of the seven spectral orders are shown ( the first order , spanning @xmath262.43 to 2.47 @xmath15 m , was too far red to obtain appreciable signal in our cv spectra , while the seventh order spectrum is dominated by the strong telluric feature at 2.05 @xmath15 m ) . as shown in table 2 , @xmath17 eri has a temperature near 5100 k , and a near - solar metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath20.1 . in fig .",
    "[ eps ] , we overplot a synthetic spectrum with t = 5100 k , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath20.125 ( interpolated between the model atmospheres with [ fe / h ] = @xmath20.25 , and [ fe / h ] = 0.0 ) .",
    "the model fit to the strongest lines is excellent .",
    "note that we have inserted an h i br@xmath18 line into our line list .",
    "we do this to primarily show where this line is located .",
    "the profiles of this feature as found in the infrared spectra for each of the objects are unreliable due to the reduction technique .",
    "in addition , the profile of such a strong line can not be easily reproduced using moog .",
    "@xmath18 psc allows us to test our ability to reproduce a much lower gravity object with a very low metallicity .",
    "we used a marcs spherical , alpha - enhanced model atmosphere with log@xmath25 = 2.5 , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath20.5 to generate a synthetic spectrum for @xmath18 psc .",
    "as noted in alves - brito et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , @xmath18 psc has a modest alpha - enhancement of @xmath0 @xmath270.2 , and thus many of the metal lines are stronger in @xmath18 psc than they would be in a model that has a solar abundance pattern . since @xmath28 does not yet have the capabilities to adjust the abundances of any other species besides carbon , we ran the moog binary used by @xmath28 in a stand - alone mode , increasing the abundances of o , al and mg as detailed in alves - brito et al .",
    "we overplot this model on the observed data in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] .",

    "how well we can model such data sets we have downloaded spex data for dwarf stars spanning the spectral types k0v to k7v .",
    "the spectral type range k0v to k3v is shown in fig .",

    "[ k4tok7 ] .",
    "we generated synthetic spectra for each of these stars using the parameters listed in table 2 .",
    "the published metallicities produced excellent fits over most of the spectral range for all of the stars except hd145675 ( k0v ) .",
    "we found that the best fitting model for hd145675 over the entire @xmath1-band required a lower metallicity , [ fe / h ] = @xmath270.25 , than tabulated for this object ( though within the observed error bars ) .",
    "close inspection of fig .",
    "[ k0tok3 ] shows that the synthetic spectra do not do a very good job of matching the strongest spectral features in the 2.10 to 2.15 @xmath15 m bandpass .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is not obvious .",
    "the fit of the synthetic spectra over the rest of the @xmath1-band suggests the tabulated ( or derived ) metallicities are correct .",
    "this might be a problem with continuum subtraction . to investigate this , we reduced and plot the spex data for the g9v star hd161198 observed during the same run as our program cvs [ note that hd161198 is a spectroscopic binary with a cool secondary star ( duquennoy et al .",
    "1996 ) , and it is not a useful spectral template ] .",
    "the model for hd145675 does a good job at fitting the spectrum of hd161198 in this range , indicating that continuum subtraction is not the issue .",
    "this suggests that the problem could be due to either the data reduction process , or some issue with the telluric standard and/or object spectra .",
    "the maximum amount of observed signal occurs in this bandpass , and the k0v , k1v , and k3v have @xmath1 @xmath9 4.7 ( hd3765 has @xmath1 = 5.16 , while hd145675 has @xmath1 = 5.55 ) , so perhaps it is a linearity issue .",
    "the discrepancy between the models and observed spectra in the 2.10 to 2.15 @xmath15 m bandpass is not as severe for the k4v to k7v templates ( even though the k7v template is 61 cyg b , with @xmath1 = 2.32 ) .",
    "clearly , however , our synthetic spectra do an excellent job at matching objects with known temperatures and metallicities . especially important for the current program",
    "is the match of the model spectra to the observed co features over a wide range of temperature and metallicity .      in the preceding we have modeled the spectra of objects with known parameters . for modeling the cvs , where the temperatures and metallicities are poorly known , requires the generation of a large number of models , and a robust method to match the synthetic spectra to the observations . with the python wrapper",
    "we have constructed to the modified version of the moog program described above , we are able to generate a large grid of models covering a user - defined range of the following parameters : t@xmath29 , log @xmath25 , [ fe / h ] , and [ c / fe ] .",
    "microturbulence was fixed at 2 km s@xmath30 , and macroturbulence was not included since it is a small effect at the resolution of our observational data . in _",
    ", if the synthetic spectra are designated to be stored as fits files , each model actually contains two synthetic spectra : one unsmoothed , full resolution model , and one model convolved with a rotationally broadened spectrum appropriate for the target at the observed spectral resolution ( which must be specified before the grid creation ) . a full grid covering the entire parameter space ( 3800 @xmath9 t@xmath29 @xmath9 5200 k , 3.0 @xmath9 log @xmath25 @xmath9 5.0",
    ", @xmath31 @xmath9 [ fe / h ] @xmath9 @xmath271 , and @xmath31 @xmath9 [ c / fe ] @xmath9 @xmath271 ) requires about one day to create on a 32 core machine and occupies @xmath0 86 gbyte in fits output format .",
    "obviously , smaller grids can be generated much more rapidly if the input parameter space can be narrowed .      with such large grids ,",
    "it is easy to be overwhelmed by the quantity of data . given a suitable subset of parameters , a direct grid search is possible ; gather a list of valid models , and step through them one at a time comparing the model to observations .",
    "given the sometimes low s / n of the observational data , however , a @xmath32 statistic is not calculated across the entire observational range , but restricted to the areas of greatest impact .",
    "for example , including na i , ca i , mg i , al i , fe i lines , and the co bands .",
    "this restricted region has the advantage of avoiding areas prone to increased levels of noise , and generally improves the quality of the fits to the observations .",
    "another method of stepping through the parameter space involves the use of an evolutionary algorithm to find the best fit to the data .",
    "evolutionary algorithms are based off the ideas of biological evolution , the simple premise that in some given population only the `` fittest individuals '' ( combination of all parameters ) will `` breed '' and influence the next generation of that population . if we imagine representing our parameters as 1d binary strings , then the behavior and the manipulation of the binary strings over the course of the fit is not unlike that of dna during reproduction .",
    "sets of parameters can be mutated , introducing diversity into the population which helps to avoid getting stuck in a local maximum or minimum in the `` @xmath33 landscape '' .",
    "mutations take the form of bit flips or swaps , analogous to transcription errors in dna replication .",
    "we used a genetic algorithm framework called @xmath34 .",
    "the algorithm proceeds as follows :    1 .   make an initial first guess at the parameters based on spectral shape 2 .",
    "choose an appropriate maximum number of generations to evolve through as well as the initial population size 3 .",
    "`` breed '' and `` mutate '' the `` fittest '' members in the population to create a new generation 4 .",
    "repeat # 3 until the population converges to the desired level    in this manner , all parameters are varied continually as the population converges towards some minimum @xmath32 , at least a factor of four faster than the plain grid searching technique . using both grid search and genetic algorithm techniques ,",
    "the grid created with moog can be readily compared with the appropriate subset of cv spectra to attempt to determine as many stellar parameters as possible .",
    "both methods are available in _ kmoog _ , though we find the brute force is sufficiently rapid and as reliable as the genetic algorithm technique .",
    "heat maps showing the best fitting models for any two parameters are then generated to allow the determination of the best fitting model(s ) .    as we will find below , determining the exact value t@xmath29 or",
    "[ fe / h ] for an unconstrained object from a @xmath1-band spectrum is difficult .",
    "many of the relevant oscillator strengths for transitions in this bandpass are unknown , and we have had to estimate a number of them by comparison of models to observations .",
    "in addition , our line list is incomplete , and thus weaker spectra features can contribute in a negative fashion to the assessment of the fit of a model to the data .",
    "the issues of telluric correction and continuum subtraction , as noted above , can introduce additional uncertainties into the goal of finding the best fitting solution .",
    "thus , the @xmath32 analysis just described must be done carefully , focussing on the strongest spectral features , insuring that there is not a spectroscopic anomaly in that feature which can be attributed to random noise variation , or to the telluric correction process .",
    "it is extremely difficult to produce a fully automated best fit regimen that can blindly solve for the parameters of a previously unconstrained object in the @xmath1-band , even when focused on specific spectral lines .",
    "currently , we manually examine the @xmath32 analysis for each line / region to insure that it is reliable , and that no unexpected events have occurred that affect the line / region under analysis .",
    "one such anomaly will be encountered shortly when we discuss the al i line ( at 2.116 @xmath15 m ) in ss cyg .",
    "it has an unusual strength that defies obvious explanation . @xmath35",
    "analysis of this line results in a super - solar abundance . we continue to work on the matching aspects of _ kmoog _ , but in its current state , a more interactive ( `` hands - on '' ) approach is required to insure the most robust results .",
    "given that we have some information on the spectral types of the secondary stars in our cvs , we decided to use smaller grid than can be generated with the default settings of _",
    "kmoog_. for example , tests in hamilton ( 2013 ) show that even the moderate resolution @xmath1-band spectra are inadequate for assessing gravity .",
    "given the large rotational broadening of our targets , it will be impossible to constrain the surface gravity for the program cvs .",
    "thus we fixed log @xmath25 = 4.5 for modeling ss cyg and ru peg , and log @xmath25 = 4.0 for gk per ( see below ) , to reduce parameter space , and increase the efficiency of the grid searching process .",

    "we have obtained moderate resolution @xmath1-band spectroscopy of three cvs that were previously noted to have weaker than expected co features : ss cyg , ru peg , and gk per . because those earlier data were obtained at lower resolution , r @xmath0 2,000 , questions were raised about the possibility of `` veiling '' of the co features to make them appear weaker . while we show below that this argument has no validity if realistic veiling scenarios are examined , it is the increased dispersion of the spectra obtained with nirspec that easily argues against such a scenario .",
    "the nirspec data have a dispersion of 0.32  / pix , nearly 1/17 that of the spex data .",

    "the spex data covers both features , and while there are hints of both of these bandheads in the data for ss cyg and ru peg , the spectra are simply too noisy to draw any firm conclusions .",

    "we also artificially multiplied the emissivities of the pfund lines by factors 10 and 100 and added them to the k4v template . only at very large multiplicative factors",
    "can their presence be detected , and even then , they add a smooth continuum to the co region , leaving the absorption features relatively undisturbed , but producing a highly distorted continuum .",
    "even with this simplistic model , it is clear that h i pfund emission can not provide the veiling necessary to explain weak co features .",
    "the detection of co emission in wz sge ( howell et al . 2004 ) has led to the suggestion that co emission is the source of the veiling needed to produce weaker than expected co features seen in the program cvs . since the co emission must come from the accretion disk , a similar result as that for the pfund continuum emission attains . as discussed in scoville et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , such emission is expected to be confined to regions where t @xmath52 3000 k , and where the densities are high , @xmath53 @xmath54 10@xmath55 @xmath56 . since ss cyg was in a minimum during our observations ,",
    "presumably these conditions exist somewhere within its accretion disk .",
    "as shown in bik et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , optically thin co emission features are essentially the inverse of the co absorption features seen in late type stars .",
    "this similarity allows us to construct crude models to investigate what co emission might look like if its origin was in a cv accretion disk .",
    "if we assign the co emission to the disk , then the broadening of any spectral feature located there will be much greater than that of the slower rotational broadening of the secondary star ( 89 km s@xmath12 in the case of ss cyg ) .",
    "for example , if the accretion disk extends to 75% of r@xmath57 ( the roche lobe radius of the white dwarf ) , using the stellar parameters for ss cyg in bitner et al .",

    "[ sscygcocomp ] , we add a rotationally broadened co spectrum to the best fitting synthetic spectrum for ss cyg using the value for the h i br@xmath18 line ( fwhm = 73  ) , and a co emission spectrum broadened by half that value . as could be expected ,",
    "the result is a dramatic change in the profiles of the co features , with an emission peak preceding each bandhead , a subtle redward shift for the location of the strongest absorption , and a dramatic narrowing of the co bandhead profiles .",
    "obviously , the data for none of our objects resembles this result .",
    "more complicated scenarios for the emission profile could be constructed , but to truly diminish the co features without distorting the resulting spectrum _ requires _ the addition of co emission with a broadening profile that is very similar to that of the secondary star .",
    "there is no other location in a cv system besides the secondary star photosphere where such low velocities occur .",
    "we have modified the spectral synthesis program moog and have demonstrated that we are able to model moderate and lower resolution @xmath1-band spectra for stars hotter than t@xmath29 @xmath54 4000 k.",
    "we then used this program to investigate such spectra for three cvs : ss cyg , ru peg , and gk per .",

    "there have not been many predictions for the behavior of the abundances in the atmospheres of cv donor stars as a function of age / evolutionary state .",
    "marks & sarna ( 1998 ) explored how the photospheric abundances of cno elements in cv secondaries might evolve with time , including the possibilities of pollution by the common envelope phase , or through the accretion of classical novae ejecta .",
    "they found that the latter two scenarios were inadequate in producing observable changes , and concluded that only pre - contact evolution could significantly alter the cno abundances and isotopic ratios in cv secondary star photospheres .",
