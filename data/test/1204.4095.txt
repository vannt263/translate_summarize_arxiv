    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates of quasiparticles in solid - state systems has provided a new example of macroscopically coherent quantum states of matter .",
    "solid - state condensates exhibit striking fundamental differences from traditional quantum fluids such as atomic bose gases and superfluid liquid helium .",
    "much recent interest@xcite has been devoted to exciton - polaritons , which exist as normal modes of strongly coupled excitons and photons in semiconductor microcavities . due to the short lifetime of the quasiparticles",
    ", these condensates exist in a dynamic balance between pumping and decay rather than in true thermal equilibrium . as such ,",
    "these systems are capable of spatial and temporal pattern formation similar to that exhibited by lasers.@xcite    hallmark features of superfluidity such as quantized vortices@xcite and persistent currents@xcite have been observed in polariton condensates .",
    "spatial patterns and soliton dynamics have been seen to arise spontaneously in both one@xcite and two@xcite dimensions .",
    "intrinsic disorder in the material@xcite or deliberately designed potentials@xcite induce currents that may further facilitate symmetry breaking in the polariton system leading to novel patterns . in particular , vortices have been seen to nucleate and get trapped because of the nonuniformities of the potential landscape.@xcite    most of the models that have been successfully and extensively used to describe pattern formation in polariton condensates are based on the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) , which is also used in the theory of lasers and thus illustrates the similarities between the two systems .",
    "such models have been applied to vortex nucleation and motion,@xcite spatial density modulations,@xcite solitons@xcite and vortex lattices.@xcite    various different modifications of this model have been considered , such as including separate dynamics of the reservoir , or modeling processes of thermal relaxation . under the assumption of fast relaxation of the reservoir and small condensate densities these modifications",
    "all simplify and the model can be written as : @xmath0 \\psi      \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 describes a trapping potential , @xmath2 is a ( spatially varying ) pump rate , and @xmath3 is a nonlinearity which causes pumping to reduce as density increases  some such nonlinear process is clearly necessary for the system to be stable , and the form included is the simplest such nonlinearity .",

    "( [ eq : cgpe ] ) is stated in oscillator units , measuring energy in units of @xmath5 , length in units of the oscillator length @xmath6 , and time in units of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the oscillator frequency of the trapping potential , and @xmath9 is the effective mass of the polariton .",
    "the values assumed in the numerical simulations are discussed at the start of sec .",
    "[ sec : prop - rotat - state ] .",
    "the polarization degree of freedom of the polaritons provides additional possibilities in pattern and defect formation , such as allowing for spatially separate vortices of left and right polarization.@xcite further possibilities for pattern formation arise in the presence of a magnetic field that favors circular polarization and therefore competes with the interactions , which favor equal densities of the polarization components , and also with any anisotropy resulting from strain fields induced by mechanical stress .",
    "the cgle can be modified to include these effects,@xcite but in this paper we will consider linear polarization only .    in the absence of pumping and decay terms ,",
    "the steady states of the cgle are often well approximated by the stationary thomas - fermi solution .",
    "one rather surprising feature of the cgle is that there exist many cases where the presence of pumping and decay significantly modifies the stable density profile .",
    "a particularly surprising case is that in a harmonic trap , the stationary state is unstable , and a rotating lattice is formed as the result of this instability.@xcite spontaneously formed vortices have been observed in polariton condensates,@xcite but these have been isolated , stationary vortices , pinned by the disorder potential in the sample . the spontaneous formation of a regular , rotating vortex lattice@xcite has not been seen experimentally .",
    "the aim of this paper is therefore to study the robustness of such lattices , and to discuss how one may overcome the difficulties that might arise in detecting a rotating vortex lattice .",
    "we consider the robustness of vortex lattices with respect both to deformations of the circular harmonic trapping potential considered previously ,  @xcite and also to modifications of the cgle , such as energy relaxation .",
    "we find that there is definite sensitivity to the trapping potential  both elliptical distortion as well as background disorder can destroy the regular vortex lattice and replace it with a chaotic regime , and we present numerical results for the critical distortion and disorder that destroy the lattice .",
    "this fragility with respect to the geometry of the trapping potential contrasts with the relative robustness of the vortex lattice to other terms that might be present in the cgle , such as phenomenological approaches to the inclusion of relaxation processes .",
    "detection of moving vortices in a polariton condensate is non - trivial .",
    "polariton condensates can be imaged directly using the photons escaping from the semiconductor microcavity .",
    "each image requires that light be gathered over a non - negligible period of time , and therefore any moving feature will tend to smear out .",
    "hence rotating configurations would not be directly visible in time integrated images .",
    "we show that these problems can be overcome by using a defocused homodyne imaging scheme , allowing stationary repeatable images to be observed , which fully characterize the vortex lattice .",
