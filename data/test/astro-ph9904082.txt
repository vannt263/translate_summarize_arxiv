    "it is now 45 years since cocconi @xcite drew attention to the broadening effects of the geomagnetic field on the lateral development of electron - photon cascades in the atmosphere .",
    "allen @xcite discussed the interaction of the geomagnetic field and the cascade electrons / positrons as the origin of the radio frequency emission produced by large cosmic ray showers .",
    "et al _ @xcite suggested that the geomagnetic separation of muons could be used to estimate the height of origin of showers .",
    "porter @xcite and browning and turver @xcite made calculations for the production of erenkov radiation by electron - photon cascades in the atmosphere , with allowance for the effects of the geomagnetic field .",
    "ground based gamma ray astronomy exploits the magnifying effects of the atmosphere to enable the detection of very low fluxes of gamma rays from a variety of sources @xcite .",
    "the cascade of electrons initiated by a primary gamma ray produces , at an altitude of about 10 km , erenkov light which reaches the ground in a pool @xmath0 m in diameter .",
    "it is possible to detect gamma rays of energy @xmath3 300 gev via this erenkov light produced in the atmosphere with an effective collection area , for our mark 6 telescope , of @xmath4 m@xmath5 .",
    "bowden _ et al _ @xcite discussed the effect of the geomagnetic field on the performance of ground based gamma ray telescopes .",
    "the interaction of the field and the cascade electrons produces a broadening of the atmospheric erenkov light image resulting in a reduction in the density of light sampled by the telescope ; so the energy threshold for the telescope increases .",
    "this is observed in the higher count rate for a telescope detecting showers propagating along the lines of the field ( with no spreading ) than when observing cascades developing perpendicular to the field lines ( and being spread ) , all other factors being the same .",
    "typical differences in measured count rate were about 20% in these extreme cases .",
    "the possibility was noted , on the basis of simulations , that an associated rotation of the direction of the erenkov light images may occur for cascades developing under high magnetic fields and in unfavourable directions .",
    "this could be of importance in ground - based gamma ray studies since the orientation of the image in gamma ray initiated cascades is the key to rejection of @xmath3 99% of the charged cosmic ray background @xcite .",
    "lang _ et al _ @xcite showed that the measurements of tev gamma rays from the crab nebula using the imaging erenkov technique were not significantly affected when the magnetic field was @xmath6 0.35 g.    we report measurements made using a ground based gamma ray telescope of cascades developing under the influence of fields up to 0.55 g. observations with the mark 6 telescope operating in narrabri , australia which is discussed by armstrong _",
    "et al _ @xcite are subject to such magnetic fields when observing objects to the south .",
    "the observational data demonstrate all the effects of the geomagnetic field on cascades which are predicted by simulations .",
    "the lateral distribution of electrons and positrons near the maximum of an electromagnetic shower in air is approximately axially symmetric .",
    "the presence of a transverse component of magnetic field will cause the electrons and positrons to separate and the lateral distribution to become wider along the radial direction perpendicular to the transverse field component .",
    "the order of magnitude of this effect may be estimated .",
    "a relativistic electron of energy @xmath7 ( mev ) will follow a circular path in a transverse magnetic field of strength @xmath8 ( g ) with a radius of curvature @xmath9 ( km ) of @xmath10 .",
    "the energy of the typical erenkov light - producing electron at shower maximum is @xmath11 100 mev ( the critical energy in air ) , which is at a height of @xmath11 10 km for a 250 gev primary gamma ray . the radius of curvature of these electrons for a maximum transverse magnetic field of 0.56 g is @xmath11 6 km .",
    "the typical length of such an electron s path in air at 10 km altitude is @xmath11 1 km , giving a lateral deflection of @xmath11 80 m. at a height of 10 km this corresponds to an angular deflection of @xmath12 , the same order as the coulomb scattering width .",
    "it should be possible to detect this as a broadening of the shower along one axis .",
    "the effect of the broadening will depend on the orientation of the image with respect to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the direction of the shower axis in the atmosphere is within @xmath111@xmath13 of the telescope - source line .",
    "the transverse magnetic field component therefore lies very close to the plane of the focal image of the shower .",
    "the parameters of an image which are used to discriminate between gamma rays and hadrons depend primarily on the second spatial moments . in a coordinate frame in which the x - axis is aligned with the projected field direction ,",
    "these are @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the orientation angle of the long axis of the image is .",
    "those shower images whose major axes are aligned with the projected direction of the magnetic field have .",
    "the moment @xmath17 will be expected to be increased by the magnetic field and the images will be widened only . for images at other orientations , and",
    "the result of an increase in @xmath18 will be to rotate their minor axes towards the projected field direction .",
    "the main parameter used to discriminate gamma rays is _ alpha _ , the angle contained within the long axis of the image and the radius vector from the source position to the centroid of the image .",
    "any rotation of the image may affect _ alpha _ and hence the sensitivity for gamma ray detection .",
    "this is discussed further in section  [ simulations ] .",
    "monte carlo simulations of gamma ray and hadron cascades have been made to investigate the strength of this geomagnetic effect .",
    "these simulations have been performed using a monte carlo code developed from that used in our earlier work @xcite which incorporates the responses of the university of durham telescopes .",
    "the results of the simulations have been validated against established simulation codes e.g. mocca @xcite .",
    "agreement has been found in all cases .",
    "the consequence of an increase in the lateral and angular spread of the shower electrons is a decrease in the density of erenkov light on the ground .",
    "this leads to a decrease in counting rate for fixed threshold , which was reported by us from measurements , using a non - imaging telescope , of counting rate against azimuth at fixed zenith angle @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : simtotal ] shows the simulated reduction in the counting rate of a gamma ray telescope of the type used by us for hadron primaries , relative to the zero - field case , caused by a transverse magnetic field of 0.5 g. this is consistent with our earlier measurements  a reduction of up to @xmath19 in count rate for gamma ray energies @xmath20 gev @xcite and , apparently , a greater reduction for @xmath21 gev cascades .    in our earlier work",
    "@xcite we suggested that the distribution of recorded photons in an imaging camera may be distorted .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : simimage ] the pattern of photons in individual simulated 1 tev gamma ray cascades developing under the effects of 0 and 0.56 g geomagnetic fields . we also show the predicted responses of our camera after allowing for optical distortion , pixellation of the camera , measurement noise and passing through our standard data analysis package .",
    "the simulations for the pairs of cascades developing under the influence of a field and no field have been initiated using the same random number seed ; this ensures , as far as is possible , that the early development of the cascade ( which dominates the resulting image and is nearly independent of field ) is identical for the two simulations .",
    "the expected effects on the shape of the image ( widening or lengthening and rotation , depending on the orientation of the image with respect to the magnetic field direction ) was apparent , both in the distribution of photons hitting the detector and in the processed image .",
    "the predicted width of a shower image was investigated as a function of magnetic field strength and angle for gamma rays of energy 500 gev .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ fig : simswid ] for transverse field strengths of 0.0 , 0.2 and 0.5 g. no allowance is made for the broadening effects of the defects in the mirror or the pixellation of the recording pmt camera .",
    "the effect of a 0.5 g field on the width ( minor axis ) of such undistorted gamma ray images is seen to be greatest when the image minor axis is perpendicular to the projected field direction , as expected .",
    "small transverse fields of 0.2 g have a limited effect on the image width . however , the effect on the pointing angle _ alpha _ become noticable and may vary both with the image s angle to the magnetic field and with its eccentricity ( defined as the ratio _ width_/_length _ ) .",
    "for example , an image with very low eccentricity may be widened only by a small amount but rotated through a large angle .",
    "histograms in _ alpha _ are shown in figure  [ fig : simsalpha ] for the simulated gamma rays , for which widths were shown in figure  [ fig : simswid ] , under the influence of fields of 0.0 , 0.2 and 0.5 g.    the effects of mirror quality and camera pixellation of a typical telescope may reduce this change in width but may not mask the change in orientation of the image .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : tracks ] the celestial sphere , as viewed from the site of the mark 6 telescope in narrabri , australia , showing the loci of constant magnetic field strength .",
    "we indicate the tracks on the sky for the telescope during observations of a number of potential gamma ray sources which have been intensively studied .",
    "in fact , most of the sources studied at narrabri are in the azimuth range @xmath22 and in directions for which the magnetic field is @xmath3 0.35 g and in many cases @xmath3 0.5 g. the telescope sensitivity is therefore likely to be reduced by the broadening of the distribution of _ alpha _ for many of our observations , unless corrections are applied .",
    "all data reported here have been obtained with the mark 6 vhe gamma ray telescope which has been described in detail by armstrong _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the telescope measures gamma rays in the energy range 300 gev  10 tev , with a 50% trigger probability at an energy of @xmath0 gev .",
    "it comprises an alt - azimuth mount with three 7 m diameter f/1.0 aluminium mirrors with an rms spread for a point source of @xmath23 .",
    "the pixel size for a @xmath24 diameter photomultiplier is @xmath25 .",
    "the focal plane of the central mirror contains a 109-pixel camera comprising a close - packed hexagonal array of 91 1-inch diameter photomultipliers surrounded by a ring of 18 2-inch diameter photomultipliers .",
    "the field of view of the imaging camera is @xmath26 wide .",
    "the mirrors on the left and right of the mount each contain a triggering detector of 19 2-inch photomultipliers in a close - packed hexagonal array .",
    "each photomultiplier is contained in a mumetal shell designed to give magnetic and electrostatic shielding .",
    "the effect of the geomagnetic field on the performance of the photomultipliers , with and without shielding , has been studied @xcite . for the 1-inch hamamatsu r1924 pmt",
    "the effect of a 0.5 g field on the gain was not measureable and less than 1% . for the 2-inch phillips xp3422 pmt the measured decrease in gain due to a 0.5 g field was 1% .",
    "shielded photomultipliers of both types show no measurable effects due to the magnetic field .",
    "the control of the attitude of the telescope is via dc servomotors driving onto gears mounted directly on the telescope structure .",
    "angles are sensed by absolute digital 14-bit shaft encoders with a resolution of @xmath27 .",
    "the calculated azimuth and zenith of a source is compared by a digital servomechanism ( employing 12-bit resolution ) with the shaft encoder outputs at 100 ms intervals .",
    "the error signals are passed via dacs to the dc motor amplifiers .",
    "these provide damping on acceleration and stabilise the movements of the telescope structure .",
    "thus although the telescope pointing is known to a resolution of @xmath28 , the source can be offset from the camera centre by up to @xmath29 by this mechanism .",
    "the attitude of the telescope is measured in two ways .",
    "the shaft encoder positions are recorded for each event to 14-bit accuracy .",
    "this gives a measurement of the pointing to @xmath30 within the telescope system .",
    "in addition , a coaxial optical ccd camera is mounted on the telescope .",
    "the output of this ccd camera is continuously monitored by microcomputer , which measures the position and brightness of a nominated guide star within the @xmath31 field .",
    "this information is integrated into the data stream on an event - by - event basis .",
    "guide stars of magnitude @xmath32 can be employed , providing absolute position sensing for the telescope to better than @xmath33 .",
    "false source analysis has been shown to be a useful method of demonstrating that @xmath34-ray like events originate from the source direction @xcite .",
    "conversely , such analyses may also be used to verify the steering performance of a telescope , if an established @xmath34-ray emitter is observed",
    ". however , we have only one data set for a gamma ray source containing data which are _ not _ subject to the effects of a strong geomagnetic field  see section [ pks2155alpha ] .",
    "most of the data considered here were taken during routine observations of potential gamma ray sources during 1996  1998 .",
    "a small amount of data was taken in dedicated measurements at fixed values of azimuth and zenith , corresponding to a range of values of the geomagnetic field .",
    "the only restriction imposed on data was that events should lie within @xmath35 of the centre of the camera ( to avoid edge effects ) and were large enough ( 5 times the triggering threshold ) to ensure that their shape was well measured .",
    "the investigation of the sensitivity of the count rate to the magnetic field which established the effect with the mark 3 and mark 4 telescopes @xcite has been repeated for the mark 6 telescope .",
    "we find that the count rate observed with the mark 6 telescope for cascades developing under minimum and maximum values of the geomagnetic field at a constant zenith angle of @xmath36 differs by about 15% , as expected .",
    "the widths of images recorded by the mark 6 telescope in directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field have been investigated . for a large sample of cascades measured during observations of a range of sources the differences of the mean width in the parallel and perpendicular directions",
    "are shown in figure [ fig : distortion ] for a range of values of distorting field .",
    "the widths of images in directions perpendicular to the field are significantly greater than those in parallel directions for fields @xmath2 g. although the differences in widths are small , because of the effects of pixellation and noise which are common to all data , the measurements are free from systematic effects .",
    "this is because the orientation of images to the magnetic field depends on the orientation of the image in the camera .",
    "measurements of the width of the images parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field are derived from events distributed throughout the same observation .",
    "we have attempted to measure the differences in widths of images in cascades measured at fixed zenith angles of @xmath36 for values of fields less than and greater than 0.35 g. such measurements are difficult and require large exposures ( @xmath37 hr ) to give significant differences . for example , with exposures @xmath38 hr we find for @xmath39 g , the mean width is @xmath40 ( sd @xmath41 ) and for @xmath42 g the mean width is @xmath43 ( sd @xmath44 ) .",
    "the small difference in means , significant at the @xmath45 level , demonstrates the difficulty in making such a small measurement for which the standard deviation is approximately similar for all @xmath46 .      in the absence of any magnetic field and detector triggering biases , the distribution of the orientation of the images in the camera of a telescope will be isotropic .",
    "if we define a coordinate system where the angle @xmath47 is the angle of the long axis of an image to the horizontal in the camera frame , then the distribution of @xmath47 should be flat between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "minor deviations from uniformity in angle might be expected near to threshold because of the increased effect of small changes in triggering probability and the six - fold symmetry of the hexagonal arrangement of close - packed detectors .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : aysmallh](a ) the distribution in the angle @xmath47 for background hadronic events which are subject to small values of the transverse magnetic field ( 0.15 g ) .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : aysmallh](b ) the distribution in @xmath47 for images due to hadron - induced cascades recorded in special observations at fixed azimuth and zenith angles which gave a transverse geomagnetic field of 0.52 g. all of these events were recorded in dedicated observations with the telescope at a fixed zenith angle ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "data at different values of the transverse magnetic field were obtained by varying the azimuth angle .",
    "all data presented here were recorded within a period of one hour , so potential variations due to changes in camera performance , atmospheric clarity , etc .",
    "were minimised .",
    "the data were processed following our normal procedures ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the requirement that images have a minimum brightness and fall within the camera ensures that the data are free of effects of variations in night sky brightness .",
    "the data for @xmath50 g show the expected distribution indicative of a near isotropic distribution of directions in the camera with a small peak .",
    "we note a strong anisotropy , with a peak containing twice the number of events resulting from the skewing or distortion of the image , for events subject to a @xmath51 g field .",
    "the maximum of the distortion occurs at @xmath52 , which is appropriate for those observations which were made at magnetic south .",
    "the magnitude of the anisotropy displayed in figure  [ fig : aysmallh](b ) should depend on the strength of the magnetic field . in figure",
    "[ fig : ayampvh ] we plot the amplitude of the peak of the distortion in the @xmath47 distribution as a function of the magnetic field strength .",
    "each point corresponds to the result for a 15 minute segment of data .",
    "note that for values of transverse component of the geomagnetic field less than 0.35 g there is no great distortion of the @xmath47 distribution , as suggested by the work of lang _",
    "et al _ @xcite , but for values of field in excess of 0.4 g substantial distortion occurs .",
    "the position of the peak in the @xmath47 distribution depends on the angle between the projected magnetic field and the vertical direction in the camera  @xmath53 .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : aydirvh ] the correlation between @xmath53 and the position of the peak in @xmath47 .",
    "the data demonstrate the expected relation between these angles .",
    "again , each point is based on a 15 min sample of data taken during routine observations of a range of potential gamma ray sources .",
    "we have evidence that the geomagnetic field should , and does , influence the lateral development of atmospheric cascades .",
    "the observed effects on the threshold of a telescope and on the shape of the image and the magnitude and phase of the distortion of the pointing of images produced by background cosmic ray protons are as expected .",
    "a number of potential gamma ray sources has been observed using the mark 6 telescope at narrabri . in several cases",
    "there is evidence for gamma ray emission @xcite .",
    "the evidence comes mainly from a comparison of the _ alpha _ distributions for data selected on the basis of image shape for the on - source and off - source scans .",
    "the difference between the _ alpha _ distributions should show an excess of events  the gamma ray candidates  at low values of _",
    "alpha_. if the data were taken in geomagnetically unfavourable directions , as is the case for most of our data , it might be expected that the _ alpha _ distribution of the excess events would be wider than that for data taken in more favourable geomagnetic directions .",
    "consideration of data recorded from a gamma ray source which are subject to @xmath54 g may provide the only true indication of the _ alpha_-distribution for our telescope .",
    "observations of this object were made with the cascades recorded over a range of transverse geomagnetic field strengths between 0.25 and 0.5 g. the total data set contained 41 hrs of observation , as reported @xcite .",
    "the _ alpha _ plot for the difference between the on - source and off - source data taken at zenith angles @xmath55 is shown in figure  [ fig : alphaplot2](a ) .",
    "the significance of the excess at _ alpha _ @xmath56 is @xmath57 according to the maximum likelihood method @xcite .",
    "we are able to select a subset of data for which the strength of the projected field to which the cascades were exposed was @xmath6 0.35 g and for which minimal distorting effect would be expected .",
    "the _ alpha _ plot for this subset is shown in figure  [ fig : alphaplot2](b ) .",
    "the excess events all have _ alpha _ @xmath58 ( significance @xmath59 ) . the distribution is narrower than that of the total dataset and is typical of that expected for a @xmath60 pixel camera .",
    "( in the absence of any other data for gamma rays detected with our telescope and _ not _ subject to the effects of the magnetic field , we assume that this is reasonable . )    the _ alpha _ plot for the majority of the events for which the field is @xmath3 0.35 g , is shown in figure  [ fig : alphaplot2](c ) .",
    "it is evident that the width of the peak is larger for these events recorded under the influence of higher transverse magnetic fields , with equal populations for values of _ alpha _ between @xmath61 ",
    "@xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath62  @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the peak at @xmath66 ",
    "@xmath67 is superimposed on an _",
    "alpha_-plot with increasing frequency for _ alpha _ approaching @xmath68  see @xcite .",
    "the significance of this peak is therefore @xmath69 ( before allowing for the number of bins in the _ alpha_-plots ) .    on the basis of our only measurement of a gamma ray source not subject to the effects of the geomagnetic field",
    ", we have evidence that the excess events with @xmath70 _ alpha _ @xmath56 are confined to those measurements made with fields @xmath71 g. this conclusion is significant at the 2.5% level , on the basis of a @xmath72 contingency test of the populations of the @xmath73 bins in figures  [ fig : alphaplot2](b ) and [ fig : alphaplot2](c ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that , on the basis of simulations and measurement , the erenkov images from gamma rays and cosmic rays are broadened and rotated by the geomagnetic field .",
    "the broadening results in an increase in the telescope threshold and a reduction in counting rate .",
    "the rotation of the images away from the projected direction of the magnetic field in the image plane broadens the _ alpha _ distribution .",
    "these results suggest that the geomagnetic field can have an important effect on the operation of atmospheric erenkov telescopes in some directions and that , for detected and candidate sources , our narrabri site is particularly susceptible .",
    "these effects may be removed using appropriate correction techniques ; unlike noise , geomagnetic effects do not reduce the information contained in the image .",
    "we are grateful to the uk particle physics and astronomy research council for support of the project and the university of sydney for the lease of the narrabri site .",
