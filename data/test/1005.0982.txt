    "the motivation for the study reported in this paper comes from the celebrated and long - standing problem , originally posed by erds @xcite in 1946 , of obtaining a sharp lower bound for the number of distinct distances guaranteed to exist in any set @xmath0 of @xmath1 points in the plane .",
    "erds has shown that a section of the integer lattice determines only @xmath10 distinct distances , and conjectured this to be a lower bound for any planar point set . in spite of steady progress on this problem , reviewed next , erds s conjecture is still open .",
    "l. moser @xcite , chung @xcite , and chung  @xcite proved that the number of distinct distances determined by @xmath1 points in the plane is @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "szkely @xcite managed to get rid of the polylogarithmic factor , while solymosi and tth @xcite improved this bound to @xmath14 .",
    "this was a real breakthrough .",
    "their analysis was subsequently refined by tardos @xcite and then by katz and tardos @xcite , who obtained the current record of @xmath15 , for any @xmath16 , which is @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    "we transform the problem of distinct distances in the plane to an incidence problem between points and a certain kind of curves ( helices or parabolas ) in three dimensions . as we show , sharp upper bounds on the number of such incidences translate back to sharp lower bounds on the number of distinct distances .",
    "incidence problems in three dimensions between points and curves have been studied in several recent works @xcite , and a major push in this direction has been made last year , with the breakthrough result of guth and katz  @xcite , who have introduced methods from algebraic geometry for studying problems of this kind .",
    "this has been picked up by the authors  @xcite , where worst - case tight bounds on the number of incidences between points and lines in three dimensions ( under certain restrictions ) have been obtained .",
    "the present paper serves two purposes .",
    "first , it studies in detail the connection between the distinct distances problem and the corresponding 3-dimensional incidence problem . as it turns out ,",
    "there is a lot of interesting geometric structure behind this reduction , and the paper develops it in detail .",
    "we offer several conjectures on the number of incidences , and show how , if true , they yield the almost tight worst - case lower bound @xmath9 on the number of distinct distances .",
    "unfortunately , so far we have not succeeded in proving these conjectures .",
    "nevertheless , we have made considerable progress on the incidence problem itself , which is the second purpose of the study in this paper .",
    "we show how to adapt the algebraic machinery of @xcite to derive sharp bounds for the incidence problem . @xcite to derive sharp bounds for the incidence problem .",
    "these bounds are very similar to , and in fact even better than the bounds obtained in @xcite for point - line incidences , where they have been shown to be worst - case tight .",
    "however , they are not ( yet ) good enough to yield significant lower bounds for distinct distances .",
    "we believe that there is additional geometric structure in the particular problem studied here , which should enable one to further improve the bounds , but so far this remains elusive .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the reduction from the planar distinct distances problem to the 3-dimensional incidence problem mentioned above . in doing so , we note and explore several additional geometric connections between the two problems ( as manifested , e.g. , in the analysis of _ special surfaces _ given below ) .",
    "we then present the tools from algebraic geometry that are needed to tackle the incidence problem ; they are variants of the tools used in @xcite , adapted to the specific curves that we need to handle .",
    "we then go on to bound the number of incidences .",
    "we first bound the number of rotations in terms of the number of parabolas , and then bound the number of incidences themselves .",
    "the latter task is achieved in two steps .",
    "we first use a `` purely algebraic '' analysis , akin to those in @xcite , to obtain a weaker bound , which we then refine in the second step , using more traditional space decomposition techniques .",
    "the final bound is still not as good as we would like it to be , but it shows that the case studied in this paper `` behaves better '' than its counterpart involving lines .    [",

    "hence , we have @xmath724 , the same bound as above .",
    "altogether , the number of incidences is thus @xmath725 we now choose @xmath726 this choice of @xmath675 makes the first and third terms in the incidence bound equal to each other , and they both dominate the second term , as is easily verified , using the fact that @xmath342 .",

    "finally , when @xmath735 , we use the szemerdi - trotter bound in ( [ weak23 ] ) , which is easily seen to yield the bound @xmath508 .",

    "moreover , we also have the szemerdi - trotter bound @xmath739 , which is smaller than the previous bound for @xmath740 . substituting these bounds in the analysis of ( h3 ) and ( h4 ) , we get @xmath62 ^ 2}{x } \\le |k| = n_{\\ge 2 } + \\sum_{k\\ge 3 } ( k-1 ) n_{\\ge k } = \\ ] ] @xmath741 =   n_{\\ge 2 } + o(s^{29/9 } ) .\\ ] ] it is fairly easy to show that @xmath119 is @xmath742 , by noting that @xmath119 can be upper bounded by @xmath743 , where @xmath744 is as defined in ( h1 ) . using the upper bound @xmath745 @xcite , we get @xmath746 thus , at the moment , @xmath119 is the bottleneck in the above bound , and we only get the ( weak ) lower bound @xmath11 on the number of distinct distances . showing that @xmath747 too ( hopefully , a rather modest goal ) would improve the lower bound to @xmath748 , still a rather weak lower bound .",
