    "the antarctic neutrino telescope amanda  @xcite and the future km@xmath0 icecube  @xcite are designed to observe high - energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources .",
    "the ice is instrumented with photomultipliers to pick up the cherenkov light from secondary charged particles . in order to reach the large volume needed to detect the expected small fluxes at high energies ,",
    "the density of optical modules is far too sparse to measure , for example , solar neutrinos .",
    "however , it has been recognized for a long time that these instruments can detect a supernova ( sn ) neutrino burst because the cherenkov glow of the ice can be identified as time - correlated noise among all phototubes  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used by amanda to exclude the occurrence of a galactic sn over a recent observation period  @xcite .    for amanda",
    "the physics potential of a possible sn observation is essentially limited to its detection , notably in the context of the supernova early warning system ( snews ) that would alert the astronomical community several hours before the optical explosion  @xcite . for the future icecube with 4800 optical modules",
    ", however , the number of detected cherenkov photons would be of order @xmath2 and thus so large that several interesting physics questions could be addressed in earnest .",
    "the observed quantity is the number of cherenkov photons caused by the sn neutrinos as a function of time , i.e.  a measure of the energy deposited by the neutrinos in the ice .",
    "therefore , the information about the sn signal is far more limited than what can be extracted from a high - statistics observation in super - kamiokande or other low - energy experiments that detect individual events .",
    "however , galactic sne are so rare , perhaps a few per century , that the chances of observing one depend crucially on the long - term stability of the neutrino observatories .",
    "once icecube has been built it may well operate for several decades , backing up the low - energy experiments . besides the detection and associated early warning one could measure important details of the neutrino light - curve , for example the existence and duration of the initial sn accretion phase , the overall duration of the cooling phase , and so forth . such an observation would provide a plethora of astrophysically valuable information",
    ".    however , from the perspective of neutrino physics a _ simultaneous _ observation in both icecube and another large detector such as super - kamiokande or hyper - kamiokande would be especially useful .",
    "assuming that the neutrinos have traversed significantly different paths through the earth , the two signals could well show measurable differences caused by neutrino oscillations in matter  .",
    "as this earth effect shows up only for certain combinations of neutrino mixing parameters , a dual observation may well distinguish , for example , between the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "it is well known that observing sn neutrinos with two or more detectors with different earth - crossing lengths is extremely useful , but icecube s potential has not been explored in this context . with all the low - energy observatories being in the northern hemisphere , icecube s location in antarctica is uniquely complementary for this purpose .",
    "any oscillation signature depends on the small flavor - dependent differences between the fluxes and spectra at the source .",
    "if these differences were as large as had been assumed until recently there would be little question about icecube s usefulness for co - detecting the earth effect . however , a more systematic study of the flavor - dependence of the sn neutrino fluxes and spectra reveals that these differences are more subtle , although by no means negligible  @xcite",
    ". we evaluate icecube s potential as a co - detector from the perspective of these `` pessimistic '' assumptions about the primary fluxes and spectra .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ at - icecube ] , we show that the neutrino signal from a galactic supernova can be measured at icecube with a sub - percent statistical precision . in sec .",
    "[ earth - effects ] , we calculate the earth matter effects on this signal and illustrate that it is possible to detect them in conjunction with another high statistics experiment .",
    "sec .  [ concl ] concludes .",
    "the sn neutrinos streaming through the antarctic ice interact according to @xmath3 and some other less important reactions .",
    "the positrons , in turn , emit cherenkov light that is picked up by the optical modules ( oms ) frozen into the ice . while the expected number of detected photons per om was calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite , we revisit their estimate for two reasons .",
    "first , the sn signal was directly scaled to the historical sn  1987a observation in kamiokande  ii so that the exact assumptions about the neutrino flux are not directly apparent .",
    "second , the expected number of cherenkov photons detected by one om was based on estimating an effective ice volume seen by one  om . however , it is much simpler to work in the opposite direction and start with the homogeneous and isotropic cherenkov glow of the ice caused by the sn neutrinos .",
    "the om is immersed in this diffuse bath of photons and picks up a number corresponding to its angular acceptance and quantum efficiency .",
    "as a first simplification we limit ourselves to the signal caused by the inverse @xmath4 reaction @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath5 fluence ( time - integrated flux ) at earth is @xmath6 we define the `` sn fudge factor '' as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total energy leaving the sn in the form of @xmath5 after flavor oscillations have been included , @xmath9 is the average @xmath5 energy , and @xmath10 the distance .",
    "the energy deposited in the ice per target proton is @xmath11 . for the inverse @xmath4 cross section we ignore weak - magnetism and",
    "recoil corrections and also the difference between @xmath5 and positron energy so that  @xcite @xmath12 for the neutrino flux of each neutrino and anti - neutrino species we assume a distribution of the form  @xcite @xmath13\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the average energy , @xmath15 a parameter that typically takes on values 2.55 depending on the flavor and the phase of neutrino emission , and @xmath16 the overall flux at the detector in units of @xmath17 .",
    "this distribution implies @xmath18 altogether we thus find @xmath19 with @xmath20 this fudge factor can also be taken to include deviations from the simplified energy dependence of the cross section and deviations from the assumed spectral shape .",
    "the cherenkov angle for photon emission by a charged particle is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the medium s refractive index and @xmath4 the particle s velocity . with @xmath23 for ice , neglecting the @xmath24-dependence , and @xmath25 we have @xmath26 .",
    "a particle with unit charge produces cherenkov photons per unit path length and per unit wavelength band according to @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "assuming that @xmath22 and thus @xmath29 are independent of wavelength we integrate over @xmath24 and find @xmath30 taking the useful wavelength range to be 300600  nm this translates into 319 photons per cm pathlength . taking the positron mean free path to be 12  cm for an energy of 20  mev , and taking it to be proportional to its energy , the number of useful cherenkov photons per deposited neutrino energy is @xmath31 with yet another fudge factor @xmath32 .",
    "the density of ice is @xmath33 , corresponding to about @xmath34 proton targets .",
    "therefore , the sn neutrinos produce @xmath35 useful cherenkov photons per unit volume of ice .",
    "multiplying this number with the speed of light and dividing by @xmath36 gives us the resulting diffuse photon flux in units of @xmath37 .",
    "however , the average lifetime of these photons is @xmath38 with @xmath39 the absorption length .",
    "therefore , the neutrino - induced photon fluence is found by multiplying the flux with @xmath38 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "the number of events produced by this fluence in a given om depends on the average quantum efficiency taken to be @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , it depends on the angular acceptance , i.e.  the effective photo cathode detection area @xmath43 times the angular acceptance range @xmath44 . therefore , in one om we expect @xmath45 with @xmath46 this result is independent of the presence of bubbles in the ice that scatter the photons .",
    "the cherenkov glow of the ice represents an isotropic and homogeneous distribution that is not changed by elastic scattering .      in order to compare our result with the one derived in ref .",
    "@xcite we need to translate their assumptions into our fudge factors .",
    "the @xmath5 distribution was taken to follow a fermi - dirac spectrum with @xmath47  mev , implying @xmath48  mev .",
    "the distance of the sn was taken to be 10  kpc , and the total energy release was scaled to the kamiokande  ii signal for sn  1987a . with our choice of the @xmath4",
    "cross section these assumptions correspond to @xmath49  erg , i.e.  to @xmath50 .",
    "these authors also used a quadratic energy dependence of the cross section . integrating over their fermi - dirac spectrum they effectively used @xmath51 .",
    "further , they assumed 3000 useful cherenkov photons for 20  mev deposited energy , i.e.  effectively @xmath52 .",
    "for the absorption length they used 300  m , i.e.  @xmath53 . finally , they assumed a quantum efficiency of 25% , a cathode area of 280  @xmath54 , and an acceptance range of @xmath55 , i.e.@xmath56 .",
    "altogether , we find for these assumptions @xmath57 per om .",
    "this compares with 273 in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e.  our result is larger by a factor  1.5 .",
    "the result in ref .",
    "@xcite was backed up by a detailed monte carlo treatment of the production and propagation of cherenkov photons in the amanda detector .",
    "therefore , the difference may well relate to details of the om acceptance and wavelength - dependent quantum efficiency and photon propagation .",
    "many of these details will be different in icecube where 10  inch photomultiplier tubes and different regions of ice will be used .",
    "detailed values for the detector - dependent fudge factors must be determined specifically for icecube once it has been built .",
    "the main difference between the assumptions in ref .",
    "@xcite and our estimate is the absorption length . when using amanda as a sn observatory a realistic value was taken to be around 100  m  @xcite .",
    "the vast difference between these estimates is that the former was based on the measured absorption length in a dust - free region of the ice . for our further estimates",
    "we stick to 100  m as a conservative assumption .      in our derivation",
    "we have used the time - integrated neutrino flux , amounting to the assumption of a stationary situation .",
    "the absorption time for photons is very small , @xmath58 .",
    "the sn signal will vary on time scales exceeding 10  ms .",
    "therefore , the cherenkov glow of the ice follows the time - variation of the sn signal without discernible inertia .",
    "hence one may replace the neutrino fluence with a time - dependent flux and @xmath59 with an event rate @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , for our further discussion it will be useful to consolidate our fudge - factors into one describing the detector response , and others characterizing the neutrino flux .",
    "therefore , we summarize our prediction for the event rate per om in the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the @xmath5 luminosity after flavor oscillations and @xmath63 here , @xmath64 also includes corrections for the energy dependence of the @xmath4 cross section .",
    "we stress that our simple estimate of the counting rate primarily serves the purpose of determining its magnitude relative to the background .",
    "the important feature is that the signal relative to the background can be determined with a good statistical precision . of course , for an absolute detector calibration a detailed modeling would be necessary . for our present purpose , however , even an uncertainty of several 10% in our estimated counting rate is irrelevant .",
    "icecube will have 4800  oms so that one expects a total event number of @xmath65 , taking all fudge factors to be unity .",
    "assuming a background counting rate of 300  hz per om over as much as 10  s this compares with a background rate of @xmath66 .",
    "assuming poisson fluctuations , the uncertainty of this number is @xmath67 , i.e.  0.25% of the sn signal .",
    "therefore , one can determine the sn signal with a statistical sub - percent precision , ignoring for now problems of absolute detector calibration .    in order to illustrate the statistical power of icecube to observe a sn signal we use two different numerical sn simulations .",
    "the first was performed by the livermore group  @xcite that involves traditional input physics for mu- and tau - neutrino interactions and a flux - limited diffusion scheme for treating neutrino transport .",
    "the great advantage of this simulation is that it covers the full evolution from infall over the explosion to the kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase of the newly formed neutron star .",
    "we show the livermore @xmath5 and @xmath68 lightcurves in fig  [ fig : simulations ] ( left panels ) . here and in the following",
    "we take @xmath68 to stand for either @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "apart from very small differences the sn fluxes and spectra are thought to be equal for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "our second simulation was performed with the garching code  @xcite .",
    "it includes all relevant neutrino interaction rates , including nucleon bremsstrahlung , neutrino pair processes , weak magnetism , nucleon recoils , and nuclear correlation effects .",
    "the neutrino transport part is based on a boltzmann solver .",
    "the neutrino - radiation hydrodynamics program allows one to perform spherically symmetric as well as multi - dimensional simulations .",
    "the progenitor model is a 15@xmath73 star with a @xmath74 iron core .",
    "the period from shock formation to 468  ms after bounce was evolved in two dimensions .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the model is simulated in spherical symmetry . at 150",
    "ms the explosion sets in , although a small modification of the boltzmann transport was necessary to allow this to happen  @xcite .",
    "unmanipulated full - scale models with an accurate treatment of the microphysics currently do not obtain explosions  @xcite .",
    "this run will be continued beyond the current epoch of 750  ms post bounce ; we here use the preliminary results currently available  @xcite .",
    "we show the garching @xmath5 and @xmath68 lightcurves in fig  [ fig : simulations ] ( right panels ) .",
    "we take the livermore simulation to represent traditional predictions for flavor - dependent sn neutrino fluxes and spectra that were used in many previous discussions of sn neutrino oscillations .",
    "the garching simulation is taken to represent a situation when the @xmath68 interactions are more systematically included so that the flavor - dependent spectra and fluxes are more similar than had been assumed previously  @xcite .",
    "we think it is useful to juxtapose the icecube response for both cases .",
    "another difference is that in livermore the accretion phase lasts longer .",
    "since the explosion mechanism is not finally settled , it is not obvious which case is more realistic .",
    "moreover , there could be differences between different sne .",
    "the overall features are certainly comparable between the two simulations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulationsicecube ] we show the expected counting rates in icecube on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rateprediction ] ) for an assumed distance of 10  kpc and 4800 oms for the livermore ( left ) and garching ( right ) simulations .",
    "we also show this signal in 50  ms bins where we have added noise from a background of 300  hz per om .",
    "the baseline is at the average background rate so that negative counts correspond to downward background fluctuations .",
    "one could easily identify the existence and duration of the accretion phase and thus test the standard delayed - explosion scenario .",
    "one could also measure the overall duration of the cooling phase and thus exclude the presence of significant exotic energy losses .",
    "therefore , many of the particle - physics limits based on the sn  1987a neutrinos  @xcite could be supported with a statistically serious signal .",
    "if the sn core were to collapse to a black hole after some time , the sudden turn - off of the neutrino flux could be identified . in short ,",
    "when a galactic sn occurs , icecube is a powerful stand - alone neutrino detector , providing us with a plethora of information that is of fundamental astrophysical and particle - physics interest .",
    "in addition , icecube is extremely useful as a co - detector with another high - statistics observatory to measure neutrino oscillation effects , a topic that we now explore .",
    "neutrino oscillations are now firmly established by measurements of solar and atmospheric neutrinos and the kamland and k2k long - baseline experiments  .",
    "evidently the weak interaction eigenstates @xmath75 , @xmath71 and  @xmath72 are non - trivial superpositions of three mass eigenstates @xmath76 , @xmath77 and  @xmath78 , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the leptonic mixing matrix that can be written in the canonical form @xmath81 here @xmath82 and @xmath83 etc . , and @xmath84 is a phase that can lead to cp - violating effects , that are , however , irrelevant for sn neutrinos .",
    "the mass squared differences relevant for the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations obey a hierarchy @xmath85 .",
    "this hierarchy , combined with the observed smallness of the angle @xmath86 at chooz @xcite implies that the atmospheric neutrino oscillations essentially decouple from the solar ones and each of these is dominated by only one of the mixing angles .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino oscillations are controlled by @xmath87 that may well be maximal ( 45@xmath88 ) .",
    "the solar case is dominated by @xmath89 , that is large but not maximal . from a global 3-flavor analysis of all data",

    "a significant modification of the survival probability due to the propagation through the earth appears only for those combinations of neutrino mixing parameters shown in table  [ tab : earthcases ] .",

    "this corresponds to case  ( b ) ; in this case the earth effect could be about 6% .",

    "naturally the differences are very small so that we show in the lower panels the ratio of these curves , i.e.  the expected counting rate with / without earth effect as a function of time for both livermore and garching .",
    "while for the livermore simulation there is a large earth effect even at early times , the change from early to late times in both cases is around 45% .",
    "therefore , the most model - independent signature is a time variation of the earth effect during the sn neutrino signal .    in order to demonstrate the statistical significance of these effects",
    "we integrate the expected signal for both simulations separately for the accretion phase and the subsequent cooling phase ; the results are shown in table  [ tab : integratedrates ] .",
    "for both simulations the earth effect itself and its change with time is statistically highly significant .",
    "based on the livermore simulation , the earth effect is much more pronounced than in garching , the latter involving more up - to - date input physics for neutrino transport .",
    "however , the _ difference _ between the earth effect during accretion and cooling is not vastly different between the two simulations . recalling that the absolute detector calibration may be very uncertain so that one has to rely on the temporal variation of the earth effect , the difference between livermore and garching becomes much smaller .",

    "for assumptions about the flavor - dependent sn neutrino fluxes and spectra that agree with state - of - the - art studies , the earth matter effect on neutrino oscillations shows up in the icecube signal of a future galactic sn on the level of a few percent .",
    "if the icecube signal can be compared with another high - statistics signal , notably in super - kamiokande or hyper - kamiokande , the earth effect becomes clearly visible as a difference between the detectors .",
    "as one is looking for a signal modification in the range of a few percent , the absolute detector calibration may not be good enough in one or both of the instruments .",
    "however , for typical numerical sn simulations the effect is time dependent and most notably differs between the early accretion phase and the subsequent neutron star cooling phase .",
    "therefore , one would have to search for a temporal variation of the relative detector signals of a few percent .",
    "the large number of optical modules in icecube renders this task statistically possible .",

    "it could also mean that we do not properly understand the flavor - dependent source fluxes and spectra .",
    "therefore , even if @xmath160 is known , our method only allows one to detect the normal mass hierarchy , it does not strictly allow one to exclude it . as far as neutrino parameters are concerned , only a positive detection of the earth effect would count for much .",
    "of course , a normal mass hierarchy and @xmath160 is certainly a plausible scenario so that expecting a positive identification of the earth effect is not a far - fetched possibility .    in summary , even though galactic sne are rare , the anticipated longevity of icecube and the long - term neutrino program at super- or hyper - kamiokande imply that detecting the earth effect in a sn neutrino burst is certainly a distinct possibility .",
