    "there is much about the earth s heat engine that is unknown .",
    "the main datum is the surface heat flow , as most of the earth is hidden from view .",
    "the total heat flux is presently estimated to be about 40 tw , which , however , suffers from uncertainties due to the size of its local variations and inaccessibility of much of earth s surface .",
    "we know that there are radioactive isotopes in the earth that can produce heat through decay .",
    "although the rate of heat generation by decay of unstable radioactive nuclides is tiny , if it is integrated over the entire volume of the earth , the total heat flux becomes huge .",
    "radiogenic heat , evidently , must be an important source of internal heat production .",
    "however , questions as how much of the earth s heat generation is from radiogenic origin , how much from residual heat remaining from the formation of the earth or from the release of gravitational energy as the earth contracts , have not yet been answered in a satisfactory way .    in the context of modeling the thermal state and thermal history of the earth",
    "it is important to know the specific heat production of the chief heat - producing radionuclides such as @xmath1k , @xmath2u , @xmath3th and @xmath4rb , encountered on surface layers and supposed to exist also in interior layers .",
    "the heat that drives mechanical motion in the mantle presumably comes mostly from radioactivity . in the radioactive decay process",
    ", a portion of the mass of each decaying nuclide is converted to energy .",
    "most of this is the kinetic energy of emitted @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles or of @xmath7 rays , which is fully absorbed by rocks within the earth and converted to heat .    for @xmath6 decays ,",
    "however , part of the energy is carried away by emitted neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "clearly , measuring the neutrino and antineutrino fluxes from the earth can provide a unique way to access information on the internal structure and dynamics of our planet  @xcite .",
    "this can be done , at least for electron - antineutrinos ( @xmath8 ) coming from @xmath2u and @xmath3th decays , the former producing 6 and the latter 4 @xmath8 per decay chain within the energy reach of current and near future neutrino detectors .",
    "antineutrinos from these elements have higher energies than those that come from @xmath1k and @xmath4rb , and are detectable at liquid scintillator detectors such as kamland  @xcite and/or borexino  @xcite through the inverse @xmath6-decay reaction , @xmath9 where the detection threshold energy is @xmath10 mev .",
    "different earth composition models predict different total amount of u and th in the mantle , which lead to different total heat flux from radiogenic origin .",
    "moreover , the fact that concentration of such elements is much larger ( a factor of @xmath11 times ) in the continental crust ( with typical thickness @xmath12 km ) than the oceanic one ( with typical thickness @xmath13 km ) and continents and ocean are not uniformly distributed over the earth make the geo - antineutrino flux different from place to place .",

    "antineutrinos are produced inside the earth in radioactive @xmath6 decays mainly of @xmath1k , @xmath2u , @xmath3th and @xmath4 rb .",
    "these elements are classified as lithophile elements in geophysics and considered to be accumulated more in the earth s crust .",
    "the abundance of these isotopes , although of prime geophysical importance , is only known at or near the surface of the earth . among these geo - antineutrinos ,",
    "the one come from @xmath2u and @xmath3th have higher energies .",
    "the maximal neutrino energy from the former and the latter are , respectively , @xmath16 = 3.26 mev and @xmath16 = 2.25 mev , which are above the threshold of existing anti - neutrino detector such as kamland  @xcite and borexino  @xcite .    here",
    "we consider , as our references , four different models which predict the distributions of @xmath2u and @xmath3th in the earth .",
    "we do not consider neutrinos coming from @xmath1k and @xmath4rb because energies of these neutrinos are below the threshold of detectors we consider in this work .",
    "for all models , we have considered three regions , namely , continental crust , oceanic crust and mantle , with different average concentrations of u and th .",
    "we ignore any contribution from the core .",
    "the distribution of radioactive elements are supposed to be uniform within each region .",
    "although the concentrations of these radioactive elements are considered to be much smaller in the mantle than in the crust , the total geo - antineutrino flux from the whole mantle can be comparable to that coming from the crust because of the much larger volume .",
    "since the total mass of u in the crust is estimated to be @xmath17 kg , and si represents about 15% of the earth mass , @xmath18 kg , the other masses in the crust and in the mantle can be obtained for each model from the mass ratios they provide . in this paper",
    "we will fix @xmath19 in the crust to the above estimated value , but we should point out that this number is known with 50% uncertainty .",
    "the average concentration of u in the continental crust is estimated to be 1.7 ppm  @xcite whereas that in the oceanic one is estimated to be 0.1 ppm  @xcite .",
    "we will assume here these numbers as reference values but as we will discuss later it is important to know the local variations of @xmath20 concentration as well as as the of the crustal thickness at each experimental site .",
    "the models can be thus classified by the amount of u they predict for the mantle @xmath21 . in this work",
    ", we follow the classification of models considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , whose characteristic will be described below .",
    "the chondritic earth model assumes for the earth s gross composition that of the oldest meteorites , the carbonaceous chondrites .",
    "the mass ratios for these meteorites  @xcite are : @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "radiogenic production in the chondritic model easily accounts for 75% of the observed heat flow , about 30 tw .",
    "u and th provide comparable contributions , each a factor of two below that of k. in this model , by taking into account that the total mass of the mantle is 4.1 @xmath25 kg ( 68  % of the total earth mass ) , concentration of u in the mantle is about 0.006 ppm .",
    "the bulk silicate earth ( bse ) model provides a description of geological evidence coherent with geochemical information .",
    "it describes the primordial mantle , prior to crust separation .",
    "the mass ratios here are : @xmath22 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in this bse model",
    "the present radiogenic production , mainly from u and th , accounts for about one half of the total heat flow , 20 tw .",
    "the antineutrino luminosities from u and th are rescaled by a factor 1.3 whereas k , although reduced by a factor of 5 , is still the principal antineutrino source .",
    "concentration of u in the mantle is 0.01 ppm  @xcite .",
    "one can conceive a model where heat production is fully radiogenic , with @xmath28 fixed at the terrestrial value and @xmath29 at the chondritic value , which seems consistent with terrestrial observations  @xcite .",
    "all the abundances are rescaled so as to provide the full @xmath30 heat flow .",
    "all particle production rates are correspondingly rescaled by a factor of two with respect to the predictions of the bse model .",
    "the concentration of u in the mantle for this model is about 0.03 ppm .",
    "this model is similar to the previous one , the abundances of u and th are also rescaled with respect to bse but it assumes that as an extreme case , the total heat flow of 40 tw are produced in the earth only by u and th , completely ignoring k , as considered in ref .",
    "this is an extreme , geo - antineutrino fluxes much larger than this limit would need serious alteration of source distribution .",
    "the concentration of u in the mantle for this model is about 0.04 ppm .",
    "here we explain how we calculate the expected number of geo - antineutrino events , for each one of the four models presented in the previous section , at a certain detector position for a given exposure . to try to distinguish models",
    "we have used a @xmath31 function minimization which is explained at the end of this section .",

    "we can also write the observable luminosities @xmath57 , in units of @xmath58 particles per second , for masses in units of @xmath59 kg , as @xmath60    in eq .",

    "we have thus the basic equations for determining radiogenic heat production and neutrino flows from models of the earth composition . in order to have some feeling about the local variation of geo - antineutrino fluxes due to the variable crustal thickness , in fig .",

    "these latter curves have been normalized with respect to the no oscillation case . from this plot , as far as the geo - antineutrino flux coming from the earth crust is concerned , we can see that about 30 - 40 % of the total crustal antineutrino flux comes from a distance within 100 km and about 50 - 60 % from a distance within 500 km from the detector .",
    "we note that this flux is about 80% , 65% , 40% and 33% of the total flux , respectively , for chondritic , bse , fr i and fr ii models .",
    "this implies that it is very important to know rather well , with better than @xmath66 resolution , the variation of the crustal thickness near the detector as well as the local variation of the concentration of radioactive elements .",
    "the number of geo - antineutrino induced events from the decay chain of element @xmath32 in the @xmath56-th energy bin , @xmath72 , is : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the number of free protons in the fiducial volume of the detector , @xmath75 is the exposure time , @xmath76 is the detection efficiency , which is assumed to be 100 % for simplicity .",
    "this integral , which is easily computed using the cross section given in ref .",
    "@xcite , is understood to be performed in a certain energy bin .",
    "we divide the number of events in the positron prompt energy range 0.9 - 2.6 mev into 4 bins with an interval of 0.42 mev following ref .",
    "note that the prompt energy @xmath77 is related to neutrino energy as @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are respectively , mass of neutron , proton and electron .",
    "the number of events in @xmath81th bin is defined as the sum of events coming from u and th , @xmath82 .",
    "we note that the 1st two lower energy bins contains events coming from both u and th induced geo - antineutrinos whereas the last two higher energy bins contain only events coming from th .",

    ", geo - antineutrinos will only contribute to the first four bins .",
    "we have taken into account in our calculation the total statistical error as well as a 6% systematic error only for reactor antineutrino events  @xcite . since currently no detector has enough data in the energy region interesting for geo - antineutrino observations , we simulate @xmath84 according to the earth composition models , taking into account the reactor antineutrino background for a given exposure and site . here , for simplicity , we ignore the systematic error for geo - antineutrinos as it is expected to be not so important compared to the statistical one for the exposure we consider in this work .    the above @xmath87 will be minimized with respect to : ( i ) @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the total geo - antineutrino flux coming from th and u at a given detector site ; ( ii ) @xmath89 assuming th / u ratio fixed ; ( iii ) @xmath90 and @xmath89 , assuming th / u ratio fixed . in the first two cases the neutrino mixing parameters are fixed to their best fitted values , in the latter only @xmath91 is fixed ( see the discussion in the following sections for further details ) .",
    "in addition , for some of our analyses , we have also added the @xmath31 function for solar neutrinos , @xmath92 , which was obtained in ref .",
    "we first discuss the determination of geo - antineutrino fluxes at kamioka as well as gran sasso sites where the former ( latter ) has larger ( significantly smaller ) reactor antineutrino background . in this work ,",
    "we have assumed the reactor antineutrino flux at gran sasso 5 times smaller than at kamioka site , however , it can actually be even smaller  @xcite . in this subsection",
    ", we assume that solar neutrino mixing parameter will be determined with a good precision in the future .",
    "see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on the perspectives of future determination of the solar neutrino mixing parameters . due to the effect of oscillation ,",
    "the observable flux suffers a reduction of @xmath93 , which implies that the original flux must be understood as @xmath65 1.7 times larger than we assumed at the detector site .    strictly speaking",
    ", experiments can only measure the total flux of geo - antineutrinos for a certain energy range , regardless of their origin ( mantle , crust ) .",
    "they can not directly access the amount of u and/or th in the crust and mantle separately .",
    "therefore , to be more conservative , we first try to consider the total geo - antineutrino fluxes from u and th as free parameters to be fitted by the data for a given input model assumption .",
    "since we still do not have enough data in the geo - antineutrino energy range ( @xmath94 mev ) , currently kamland has reported data only for about 0.16 kt@xmath0yr exposure  @xcite , we have simulated future data according to each one of the earth composition models .",
    "we have used these simulated data points as an input in our analysis . by performing a @xmath31 analysis",
    "we have investigated if the experiments can correctly reproduce the input data and distinguish among different models .",
    "first we have estimated the required exposure , in units of kt@xmath0yr to identify the presence of geo - antineutrino flux for an assumed model input , leaving the two components of the geo - antineutrino flux , coming from u and th , completely free in our fit .",
    "the results are shown in table i. the numbers in the table are the detector exposure , at each site , required to rule out or accept each model at 3 @xmath95 level .",
    "the actual fiducial volume of kamland ( borexino ) is about 0.4 ( 0.1 ) kt , which means one has to multiply by a factor 2.5 ( 10 ) the number found in table i in order to translate it to the actual detector exposure time .",
    "as naturally expected , the larger the input flux , the easier to identify the model , and therefore we need a smaller exposure to rule it out . if , for instance , a detector such as kamland , does not see geo - antineutrinos at the 3 @xmath95 level after 0.46 kt@xmath0yr exposure , it can rule out the fr ii model , but at this point it can not say anything about the other models . on the other hand , if kamland measures geo - antineutrinos at this exposure , then fr ii has to be interpreted as the preferred model , and so forth .    0.1 cm    .",

    "unfortunately it seems to be extremely difficult to distinguish between bse and chondritic models , independently of the detector exposure we have considered here . from this plot",
    ", we can conclude that for 1 kt@xmath0yr of exposure , it is not possible to distinguish among the four models considered .",
