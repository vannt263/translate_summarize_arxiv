    "these weaker conditions imply that the class of pdfs with convergent gauss - hermite expansions is much wider than suggested by the myller - lebedeff theorem cited in van der marel & franx @xcite ) .",

    ", the string network quickly evolves to a scaling solution with a constant number @xmath118 of strings passing through a hubble volume in one expansion time .",
    "since individual topological defects give rise to velocity perturbations of the dark matter through which they move up to a distance of a hubble radius , one expects a non - gaussian result , in contrast to inflationary theories which predict a gaussian pdf .",
    "therefore departures from a normal distribution may be a way to distinguish between the two main classes of theories of structure formation , inflation and topological defects .",
    "however , since many strings present between the time of equal matter and radiation contribute to the perturbations , a nearly gaussian pdf can result due to the central limit theorem .    in order to estimate the deviation of the pdf from the normal distribution we use petrov s formula ( [ edgew ] ) for the edgeworth series in this section .",
