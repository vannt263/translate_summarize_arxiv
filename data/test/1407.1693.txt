    "luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) are spectacular examples of variable stars , which can brighten by orders of magnitude on timescales of months to years .",
    "these stars are typically more evolved than the @xmath1 ceph stars , and undergo periods of outburst , typically characterized by enhanced mass - loss rates .",
    "the most energetic of these eruptions , known as giant eruptions , occur over relatively long timescales , lasting a few tens of years , and are thought to have long periods of dormancy between eruptions @xcite .",
    "the best known examples of these events have occurred in the stars @xmath2 car and p cyg .",
    "the total mass ejected in a giant eruption of this kind can be more than 1 m@xmath0 .",
    "for example , the great eruption of @xmath2 car in the mid - nineteenth century may have ejected as much as 10 - 15 m@xmath0  @xcite . during these events , both the temperature and the luminosity of the star increase , typically by 1 - 3 bolometric magnitudes .",
    "the increase in luminosity can be so large that the stellar luminosity is well above the eddington limit , which is likely a driving factor in the amount of mass lost .",

    "although giant eruptions are the most easily visible form of variability in lbvs , s dor variability is more common .",
    "s dor variations have a shorter timescale than giant eruptions , lose less mass , and the bolometric luminosity remains unchanged .",
    "the timescale for an s dor outburst is years to decades .",
    "the quiescent interval between outbursts is highly variable , but the timescale can generally be categorized as either a short timescale , less than 10 years , or a long timescale , greater than 20 years .",
    "these events do not eject mass the way a giant eruption does , but instead the stars undergo an episode of enhanced mass loss , typically ejecting around 10@xmath3 m@xmath0  per event . during an s dor episode , the visual magnitude of the star increases , typically by 1 - 2 magnitudes , while the bolometric magnitude remains the same .",
    "the position of the star moves horizontally in the hr diagram , and instability strips for both the quiescent and outburst phase can be defined observationally . in this work ,",
    "we focus on this intermediate type of variability .",
    "lbvs also show a third type of variability , known as microvariability .",
    "these variations are small , typically a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "they appear to be stochastic , with irregular periods on the order of weeks to months @xcite . for a more detailed review of lbv properties ,",
    "see the recent review by @xcite .    s dor variability , as seen in ag car and s dor for example ,",
    "was initially thought to be caused by an increase in mass loss causing the stellar photosphere to be located in a dense outflow ( a ` pseudo - photosphere ' ) . as a result",

    "observationally , lbvs are cooler than the core - he burning wr stars .",
    "the most luminous lbvs are brighter than the horizontal part of the humphreys - davidson ( hd ) limit , but hot enough to not violate the limit",
    ". they may be on their first crossing of the hr diagram in a shell h burning or core he burning phase ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "the envelopes of some lbvs are observed to have enriched he abundances and cno - cycle processed material , which is thought to indicate that the outer layers of the stars have been removed , revealing material that has previously undergone h burning @xcite .",
    "however , similar enrichment is expected in stars that are on the second crossing of the hr diagram .",
    "it is thought that lbvs occur when massive stars evolving redward encounter the hd limit . below this limit",
    ", stars are able to continue to the red to become red supergiants . as the hd limit is an empirical limit , the mass range where stars can become lbvs depends on the stellar models used .",
    "although many explanations have been proposed , there is no accepted physical explanation for the location of the limiting mass or the exact cause of the lbv phenomenon , and the hd limit is determined observationally .",
    "recent observations have shown that the evolutionary status of lbvs may be more complicated than described above .",
    "recent downward revisions of the theoretical mass - loss rates indicate that radiatively driven mass loss can not remove enough material to match the observed masses of wr stars .",
    "if the majority of massive stars are expected to end as wr stars , the most massive stars may thus need a series of giant eruptions during an lbv phase to reach the masses of typical wr stars @xcite .",
    "however , the traditional evolution sequence is now being challenged , as there is some evidence that lbvs can undergo giant @xmath2 car - like eruptions shortly before exploding as either type iin or superluminous sn @xcite .",

    ", the surrounding circumstellar medium will have a variable density , causing variations in the light curve during the interaction with the sn shock wave . a better understanding of s dor variability may help shed light on some of these open questions .",
    "it has been suggested that pulsation could be the origin of s dor variability .",
    "in particular , the quasi - periodic variability observed in massive stars could be explained by radial strange modes @xcite .",

    "other authors have argued the observed periods are too long to be strange modes , but are compatible with non - radial g modes .",
    "these modes have been shown to be unstable @xcite , but were initially expected to be too low amplitude to be easily observable .",

    "we investigate radial pulsations as a driver of lbv - like variability in stellar models from 20 to 85 m@xmath0 .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath5-effect pulsations arising from a bump in the opacity caused by fe ionization near 200000k , combined with time - dependent convection could produce a super - eddington layer , causing the star to become unstable and drive mass loss ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the models were sampled at intervals along the late main sequence and subgiant branch , typically giving 5 - 10 models at each mass and metallicity combination .",
    "we used the mass , temperature , luminosity and surface helium abundance of these models to calculate envelope models , consisting of 60 zones .",
    "the mass of each model was adjusted to ensure the bottom of the envelope reached a depth of 1 - 3 million k. this temperature ensured our models fully captured the driving region ( around 200000 k ) and the damping region .",
    "typically , the mass amounted to less than 5 % of the total mass of the star . to test the zoning in our models , we calculated a few non - linear models with 120 zones and found that the resulting periods were unchanged to within a few percent .",
    "we also performed a few calculations with 1000 zones in the linear model , and found that the periods typically changed by 1 - 2 % . the normalized work changed by factors of 10 - 50 % , although the sign did not change .    for each envelope model",
    ", we calculated the first four radial pulsation frequencies using a linear non - adiabatic pulsation code @xcite .",
    "the results of this linear pulsation calculation were used as input to a 1d hydrodynamic code ( dynstar , * ? ? ?",

    "the time - dependent convection implemented in this code is described in more detail below .",

    "our models also neglect rotation , which would also extend the photosphere and decrease the escape velocity .",
    "we hope to address this further in the future .",

    ", we fit a simple sine curve to the radial velocity variations .",
    "this method gives us the period and amplitude of the dominant pulsation period . in practice , many of our light curves appear to be multi - periodic , as shown in figure [ fig : quasip ] , but we consider only the dominant period here .",

    "our long - period and outbursting models show large variations in the photospheric properties , including effective temperature and radius .",
    "even if the pulsation amplitudes are not large enough for mass to escape from the surface , the large variations in photospheric parameters will lead to large variations in the radiatively driven mass - loss rates .",
    "determination of physical mass - loss rates can be highly uncertain , particularly in pulsating stars such as those discussed here , where the surface properties are changing rapidly over relatively short time scales .",
    "however , we will discuss the variations in the physical parameters that help determine mass - loss rates and what effect the variations in the parameters are likely to have on the resulting mass loss .",
    "standard evolution models with mixing - length theory generally assume a static structure with unvarying thermodynamic quantities in each zone that result in a constant luminosity transport via convection , and complete mixing within this region .",
    "linear pulsation models have for the most part , adopted either a frozen - in convection approximation , or an instantaneously adapting convection .",
    "reality is likely to be somewhere in - between these approximations .",
    "when a region becomes convectively unstable , there is some finite period of time during which the convective flows become established . in the nonlinear pulsating models described here , there are regions which periodically become unstable to convection . in our standard linear pulsation model with frozen - in convection , the convection carries away excess energy according to the hydrostatic equilibrium conditions for the model that do not vary with the phase of the pulsation cycle . in a model with time - dependent convection , convection can not immediately carry away the excess energy , which may cause buildup of energy and expansion in these layers .",
    "time - dependent convection , coupled with pulsations can therefore change the structure of envelope models compared to a model in hydrostatic equilibrium assuming either a frozen - in or instantaneously adapting convection approximation .",

    "although pulsations in this region of the hr diagram are driven by an iron ionization zone around 200000 k , and hence depend somewhat on the photospheric opacities , the long period and outburst - like behaviour seen here are driven by the interaction with the time - dependent convection , which is relatively independent of the opacities .",

    "<S> among the most spectacular variable stars are the luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) , which can show three types of variability . the lbv phase of evolution is poorly understood , and the driving mechanisms for the variability are not known . the most common type of variability , the s dor instability , occurs on timescales of tens of years </S>",

    "<S> we initialize the pulsation in the hydrodynamic model based on linear non - adiabatic calculations . </S>",
    "<S> pulsation properties for a full grid of models from 20 to 85 m@xmath0were calculated , and in this paper we focus on the few models that show either long - period pulsations or outburst - like behaviour , with photospheric radial velocities reaching 70 - 80 km / s . at the present time , our models can not follow mass loss , so once the outburst event begins , our simulations are terminated . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that pulsations alone are not able to drive enough surface expansion to eject the outer layers </S>",
