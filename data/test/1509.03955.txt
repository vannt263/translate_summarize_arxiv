    "the parameter estimation is one of most important ingredients in various fields of both the classical and quantum worlds metrology06prl , metrology11np .",
    "the task of quantum estimation is not only to determine the value of unknown parameters but also to give the precision of the value .",
    "it is a vital issue on how to improve the estimation precision which is closely related to the quantum cramr - rao inequality and quantum fisher information ( qfi ) fisher , jiliangxuejiuchan , jiliangxuejiuchan2,wangxiaoguangzongshu , xiaomin , xiangguoyong , kexue , pra2012 that determines the bound of the parameter s sensitivity theoretically by @xcite @xmath0where @xmath1 means the time of experiments , and @xmath2 is the qfi with the symmetric logarithmic derivative @xmath3 defined by @xmath4 .",
    "( [ crbound ] ) implies that the larger qfi means higher sensitivity of the parameter estimation .",
    "the pioneer work on the quantum parameter estimation were proposed by caves @xcite who showed that the precision of phase estimation can beat the shot - noise limit ( standard quantum limit ) .",
    "later , lots of jobs with the similar aims are proposed , such as based on maximally correlated states winelind , n00n states @xcite , squeezed states @xcite , or generalized phase - matching condition @xcite , and so on . in practical scenarios , it is inevitable for a quantum system to interact with environments , the precision of quantum estimation will be influenced by different extents @xcite . in recent years , enormous effects have been devoted to how to improve the precision of parameter estimation in the case of open systems . for example , the precision spectroscopy using entangled state in the presence of markovian dephasing @xcite and non - markovian noise @xcite are investigated ; the qfi under decoherence channels @xcite or in a quantum - critical environment @xcite are analyzed ; the qfi measured experimentally with photons and atoms are reported @xcite ; it is also reported that the qfi subject to non - markovian thermal environment @xcite could show revival and retardation loss ; the parameter - estimation precision in noisy systems could be enhanced by dynamical decoupling pulses tigao - wangxiaoguang , redesigned ramsey - pulse sequence @xcite or error correction @xcite are also shown ; noisy metrology beyond the standard quantum limits is possible when the noise is concentrated along some spatial direction @xcite . however ,",
    "if the environment we considered is a squeezed reservoir , how the qfi is influenced by the reservoir s parameters ?",
    "the squeezed reservoir has been widely studied in quantum information processing .",
    "for example , the squeezed light ( reservoir ) @xcite or finite - bandwidth squeezing @xcite for inhibition of the atomic phase decays and its application in microscopic fabry - prot cavity @xcite .",
    "in addition , some other considerations of the squeezing reservoir were also discussed , such as the quantum entanglement dynamics @xcite , heat engine recycle @xcite , geometric phase observable @xcite , etc .",
    "the physical realization of the squeezed reservoir has also been proposed both in theory and in experiment based on various techniques such as the four - wave mixing @xcite , the parametric down conversion wulingan , the suitable feedback of the output signal corresponding to a quantum nondemolition measurement of an observable @xcite , control the parameter of the driven laser @xcite , quantum conversion of squeezed vacuum states @xcite or energy - level modulation @xcite , the atomic systems in cavity qed @xcite or dissipative optomechanics system @xcite and so on .",
    "the reduction of the radiative decay of the atomic coherence in squeezed vacuum has been realized in the superconducting circuit and microwave - frequency cavity system @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the effects of reservoir squeezing on the qfi based on the non - perturbation processing @xcite .",
    "we consider a phase estimation scheme which a two - level system with an imposed unknown phase interacts with a squeezed reservoir before the final optimal measurements .",
    "to find the influences induced by the reservoir , we derive the non - perturbative master equation by the path integral method lujingjifen . in terms of the master equation",
    ", we obtain the exact analytic expression of qfi which is related to the precision of parameter estimation .",
    "it can be found that the qfi depends on the estimated parameter and the decay of qfi can be reduced by the squeezed reservoir compared with thermal ( vacuum ) reservoir . in particular , if the appropriate squeezing phase matching condition is satisfied , the decay of qfi can be prevented prominently by the reservoir squeezing .",

    "[ sec3 ] , the exact analytic expression of qfi for the estimated parameter is obtained and the effects of reservoir squeezing on the qfi are investigated .",

    "comparing eqs .",
    "( [ fisher ] ) and ( [ thermal ] ) , one can find that the decay of qfi can be reduced , i.e. , @xmath104 , if the following condition for @xmath69 and @xmath83 is satisfied , @xmath105this implies that the decay of qfi in the squeezed reservoir can be reduced duo to the reservoir squeezing .",
    "this is obviously illustrated in fig .",
    "matching(a ) and [ matching](b ) where the horizontal lines corresponds to the case without squeezing .",
    "it is apparent that the squeezing makes a large number of qfi surpass the horizontal lines , namely , the decay of qfi has been reduced . in particular , one can see that with the increasing of squeezing parameter @xmath15 , the qfi is turning high and that the region below the horizontal lines is getting small .",
    "in fact , this can be easily understood in physics .",
    "in contrast to the case without squeezing , the squeezing divided the imposed phase @xmath106 into two parts respectively related to the squeezing relevant parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 which has the opposite behaviour with @xmath15 ( see eq .",
    "( [ canshu ] ) ) .",
    "when @xmath107 or @xmath108 , @xmath80 plays the dominant role in the quantum fisher information due to the derivative relation , which shows that the quantum fisher information becomes large with the increasing @xmath15 . on the contrary , @xmath79 will play the dominant role .",
    "this relation is obviously shown in fig . [ matching ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "that is , the competition between the @xmath109 and @xmath110 lead to the reducing or increasing the decay of the qfi under reservoir squeezing for the different regions @xmath111 . from the above analysis , one can find that the squeezing phase parameter @xmath83 may play a significant role in the effects of the precision of parameter estimation .",
    "we will show it in the following .      from the analytic qfi of parameter @xmath106 eq .",
    "( [ fisher ] ) , one can find that when @xmath112 or @xmath82 , the qfi can reach the maximum with other parameters fixed . in this case",
    ", we say that @xmath16 and @xmath113 satisfy the _ squeezing phase matching_. if the estimated phase @xmath113 happens to be in the vicinity of squeezing phase matching , i.e. , @xmath114 with @xmath115 a small quantity , one will find that the decay of qfi will be prevented thoroughly , which can be found in fig .",
    "[ matching](c ) and [ matching](d ) , where we assume @xmath116 .",

    "[ matching ] is that the regions below the horizontal lines in fig .",

    "the reason is that we have chosen the same @xmath115 for all @xmath106 .",
    "in fact , it is not necessary to do so",
    ". thus we can conclude that the negative role of the reservoir squeezing could be compensated by the squeezing phase matching .",
    "in fact , fig . [ matching ] illustrates the different between the cases vacuum reservoirs with and without squeezing , since we have set the temperature to be zero . in order to find out the influence of temperature accompanied by the squeezing , we plot the qfi in fig .",

    "it is shown that with the squeezing phase matching , the reservoir squeezing @xmath15 always plays the positive role in restraining the decay of qfi , but the temperature plays a negative role .",
