    "analyses of the data from reactor @xcite , accelerator @xcite , atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite neutrino experiments conclusively demonstrate the oscillation of neutrino flavors .",
    "the results of these experiments can be interpreted by two independent mass squared differences ( between three active neutrinos ) . from the direct measurement of the invisible part of the decay width of @xmath5 boson ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath6 ) , the number of active neutrinos lighter than @xmath7 found to be @xmath8 @xcite and from the fit of the lep data to standard model prediction it found to be @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus , if an extra light neutrino exists , it should be a sterile neutrino ( singlet under the gauge symmetries of the standard model . )",

    "we consider models with at most three sterile neutrinos ( @xmath36 ) . in the basis @xmath30 , the generic mass term for neutrinos is @xmath37",
    "the @xmath38 mass matrix @xmath39 is of the following form ( after electroweak symmetry breaking ) @xmath40where @xmath41 is the @xmath42 dirac mass matrix and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the @xmath45 left - handed and @xmath46 right - handed majorana mass matrices , respectively .",
    "the non - vanishing elements of @xmath43 and @xmath44 violate lepton numbers while by assigning the lepton number @xmath47 to sterile neutrinos , @xmath41 conserves this symmetry .",
    "the left - handed mass matrix @xmath43 is not invariant under the sm gauge group @xmath48 and should be zero unless other new particles ( such as a new higgs triplet ) are present .",
    "the elements of @xmath44 can take a wide range of values , it can be as large as the gut scale @xmath49 gev which are preferred in _ see - saw _ mechanisms , or it can vanish like @xmath43 as a result of new gauge symmetries such as @xmath50 @xcite . the case @xmath51 and @xmath52 results in pure dirac neutrinos . in this case",
    "the six weyl neutrinos decompose into three pairs of neutrinos with degenerate masses .",
    "the active - sterile mixing angle in each pair is maximal @xmath53 , but the active neutrinos do not oscillate to their sterile partners because @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the masses of sterile and active neutrinos in the @xmath57-th pair , respectively .",
    "here we are interested in the case @xmath58 .",
    "the non - zero but very small values of the elements of @xmath43 and @xmath44 lift the degeneracy in mass at each pair . in this `` pseudo - dirac '' scenario ,",
    "active - sterile mixing angle in each pair is @xmath59 and active - sterile oscillation can in principle occur due to very small but non - zero @xmath60 .",
    "to illustrate this point , let us consider the one generation example . in this case , the mass matrices @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ massmatrix ] ) are numbers ( we assume that all the masses are real . ) in the pseudo - dirac limit , we obtain @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "@xmath52 , the @xmath73 matrix @xmath67 can be parameterized by 12 mixing angles and 12 cp - violating phases ( 7 dirac phases+5 majorana phases . )",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that in the pseudo - dirac limit @xmath58 and at first order of perturbation in the small parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the mixing matrix @xmath67 has only three mixing angles ( responsible for oscillation between the pairs ) and three cp - violating phases ( 1 dirac phases+2 majorana phases ) .",

    "notice that this relation reduces to the standard flavor conversion probability formula in the limit of pure dirac neutrinos @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) . by setting @xmath92 for the active neutrino generations which do not have sterile partners , eq .",

    "an oscillation experiment with baseline @xmath96 and neutrino energy @xmath97 can probe mass square difference @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath99 , the baseline is too short for flavor oscillation to take place ; on the other hand , if @xmath100 so many oscillations take place during the propagation and the oscillatory term should be averaged out . in both of these cases",
    "it is not possible to derive the value of @xmath15 in oscillation experiments .    solar neutrino experiments with the baseline 1  au  @xmath101  m and neutrino energy @xmath102  mev ,",

    "these very small values of @xmath15 has been favored by the so - called `` vacuum oscillation solution '' of the solar neutrino problem , but as is well - known this solution has been ruled out by kamland @xcite",
    ". however , the sterile - active oscillation with mass square differences @xmath104  ev@xmath2 can still be present as a subdominant effect in solar data . the recent work @xcite updates the solar data and obtains @xmath105  ev@xmath2 ( at @xmath106 level ) for the sterile - active mass splitting .",
    "this bound is the most stringent bound on @xmath15 .",
    "the flavor composition of the neutrinos from core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) also can change due to an active - sterile oscillation from the sn to earth .",
    "the mean energy of the neutrinos from a sn explosion is @xmath107  mev .",
    "thus , a sn explosion at a distance of @xmath108  kpc can probe @xmath109  ev@xmath2 .",
    "the constraint from the data of the sn1987a data is not restrictive because of the low statistics and high uncertainties in the mechanism of sne explosion @xcite .",
    "construction of future mton water - erenkov detectors can dramatically improve the current bound or find a hint for sterile neutrinos hypothesizes in pseudo - dirac scenario @xcite .",
    "population of the sterile neutrinos in the early universe and their effects on the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) can change the abundance of light elements .",
    "the standard bbn , given the number of the relativistic particles @xmath110 and the baryon asymmetry @xmath111 , predicts the abundance of the light nuclei in the universe .",
    "assuming that the sterile neutrinos are produced only in the active / sterile oscillation and the initial abundance of sterile neutrinos at temperatures @xmath112  mev is zero , the tightest limit comes from the @xmath113he abundance : @xmath114  ev@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "two main non - oscillation neutrino experiments which probe neutrino masses kinematically are tritium beta decay and neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath115 ) experiments . among them , the @xmath115 decay is sensitive to the majorana or dirac nature of neutrinos .",
    "the rate of @xmath115 decay is proportional to the effective mass of the electron neutrino which is defined as    @xmath116     + as mentioned after eq .",
    "( [ massmatrix ] ) , in the limit @xmath51 ( pure dirac neutrino ) each dirac neutrino is the superposition of two majorana neutrinos with degenerate masses and opposite cp eigenvalues .",
    "it is easy to see that the majorana neutrinos in each pair interfere destructively in eq .",
    "( [ mee ] ) ( @xmath92 ) which results in @xmath117 for pure dirac neutrinos . in the pseudo - dirac scenario with non - zero majorana masses and @xmath58 ,",
    "the cancelation is not exact and @xmath118 but it is very small @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that the observation of a positive signal in the next generation @xmath115 experiments , with sensitivities @xmath119  mev , will rule out the small values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the mass matrix of neutrinos and therefore pseudo - dirac scenario .",
    "however , two points should be considered .",
    "the first one is that the value of @xmath120 can still be significant if only one or two families of neutrinos have sterile partners .",
    "contribution of each family to the value of @xmath120 depends on the corresponding mixing matrix element @xmath90 .",
    "this means that , because of the small value of @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) , presence or absence of a sterile neutrino with a mass almost degenerate with @xmath123 do not change the value of @xmath124 substantially ; but the case with two sterile neutrinos with a masses degenerate with @xmath125 and @xmath126 leads to an effective mass @xmath120 much smaller than its value in the absence of sterile neutrinos .",
    "the second point is that the dominant contribution to @xmath115 decay can come from new particles or physics beyond the sm , such as a @xmath127 interaction @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that a non - zero @xmath115 decay rate generates small @xmath43 through radiative corrections , which results in pseudo - dirac scenario for neutrino masses .",
    "considering these points , it is not easy to draw a conclusion on pseudo - dirac scenario from the results of the @xmath115 experiments .",
    "neutrinos arriving at neutrino telescopes from astrophysical sources travel distances of the order @xmath128 mpc .",
    "the flavor conversion probabilities over these large distances can be obtained by averaging out the oscillatory terms in eq .",
    "( [ probability ] ) .",
    "two different scales of @xmath15 are involved in eq .",
    "( [ probability ] ) , one is the atmospheric , @xmath129 ev@xmath2 , and solar , @xmath130 ev@xmath2 , and the other is the very small @xmath15 between the mass eigenstates in each pair of active and sterile neutrinos . as it is shown in @xcite the oscillatory terms depending on @xmath131 and @xmath132 should be completely averaged out over these large distances .",
    "the mass squared difference @xmath15 that can be probed by neutrinos with energy @xmath97 which propagate through distance @xmath96 is    @xmath133     + thus , even for @xmath96 as large as 10  mpc oscillatory terms given by @xmath134 ev@xmath2 do not average out . after averaging out @xmath131 and @xmath135 , eq .",
    "( [ probability ] ) becomes @xcite    @xmath136     + where @xmath137 is the mass squared difference in the @xmath57-th pair .",
    "thus , if the initial flavor composition of neutrinos in the source is @xmath138 , the flavor composition of the neutrino beam arriving at earth will be @xmath22 , where    @xmath139     + the average of the cosine factor for @xmath140 is @xmath141 . thus , if for all three pairs ( @xmath93 ) the condition @xmath140 is satisfied , all three @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ flavor ] ) are multiplied by @xmath141 such that the flavor ratios @xmath22 do not change with respect to the flavor ratios in the pure dirac case @xmath142 . in this situation",
    "the only difference between the pure dirac and pseudo - dirac scenarios is that the number of neutrinos arriving at earth is reduced by half in the pseudo - dirac case .",
    "thus , it is very hard to verify pseudo - dirac scenario for distances or mass squared differences where @xmath140 for @xmath93 .",
    "that is because the estimation of the overall normalization of neutrino flux needs knowledge about the details of the neutrino production mechanism in the source which is not well understood .",
    "however , the pseudo - dirac scenario of neutrinos can be tested in neutrino telescopes for the cases that only one or two sterile neutrinos exist ( @xmath94 ) or the distance of the source or the mass square differences are such that all the three oscillatory terms given by @xmath143 do not average out . in these cases",
    "the average of one or two of the cosine factors in eq .",
    "( [ flavor ] ) are @xmath141 and the other cosine factors can be replaced by @xmath144 ( we do not consider the special situations where @xmath145 ) .",
    "thus , measuring the deviations of the flavor ratios in eq .",
    "( [ flavor ] ) from their standard values ( in the absence of nearly degenerate sterile neutrinos ) in neutrino telescopes can shed light on these cases . in the next section",
    "we discuss the details of the detection processes in the neutrino telescopes and the feasibility of identifying different neutrino flavors in these experiments . by taking into account the realistic measurable quantities in neutrino telescopes and the uncertainties in these measurements , we discuss to what extent it is possible to measure the flavor ratio of cosmic neutrinos and their deviations from the standard values .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss neutrino flavor identification in the km@xmath17 scale neutrino telescopes such as icecube or its counterparts in the mediterranean sea ; km3net , nemo , nestor and antares .",
    "a detailed description of the flavor tagging efficiencies in a typical neutrino telescope can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we summarize the main points relevant for the present analysis .",
    "particularly , for the first time , we take into account different sources of uncertainties in the calculation of event rates and also a more realistic analysis of the detectable events , such as the contribution of @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) to the @xmath3-tracks .    the flux of neutrinos arriving at earth can come from a single luminous point source or as a diffuse flux from sum over different sources at different distances .",
    "the advantage of the point sources is that the short period of the burst and the direction of incoming neutrinos can be used to reduce the background events ( especially when the source can be identified using a different method such as gamma photons for grbs ) .",
    "point sources with an intense neutrino flux detectable at km@xmath17-scale neutrino telescopes can take place in the close - by galaxies located at a distance of @xmath148  mpc and such a source of neutrinos yields about a few hundred neutrino events in icecube @xcite .",
    "discriminating between different flavors of neutrinos is a great challenge for neutrino telescopes .",
    "two types of events are completely distinguishable in the next generation of these experiments : @xmath3-track events and shower - like events .",
    "charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) interactions of different flavors can contribute to each of these events .",
    "@xmath3-track events , which are the erenkov light radiated by muons propagating through the volume of the detector , get contributions from two sources : i ) @xmath3 ( @xmath149 ) produced in the cc interaction of @xmath20 ( @xmath150 ) ; ii ) cc interaction of @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) which produce @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) leptons and the subsequent _ leptonic _ decay of tau leptons @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) produce @xmath3 ( @xmath149 ) .",

    "however , it should be noticed that the initial flavor ratio can deviates from these values due to the interplay of different mechanisms in neutrino production or effects that have not been considered in the calculation of these values .",

    "part _ of the produced muons in the decays of @xmath167 ( not all of them ) can lose their energy before decay such that the initial flavor ratio of neutrinos takes a value between the two extreme cases of pion and stopped - muon sources .",

    "( [ 120new]-f ) ) are robust against the deviations of the initial flavor ratio @xmath138 from the assumed values .",
    "to answer this question we consider particularly the case of fig .",

    "the new generation of km@xmath17 neutrino telescopes opens a new window to study cosmos via the detection of high energy neutrinos predicted to be emitted from the astrophysical objects . because of the extremely large distance of the sources ( @xmath225 mpc ) the flavor oscillation is sensitive to the very tiny mass squared differences @xmath226  ev@xmath2  @xmath227  ev@xmath2 .",
    "the existence of sterile neutrinos with masses almost degenerate with the active ones such that the mass squared differences between the active and sterile neutrinos lie in the above region is hypothesized in many models ( the so - called pseudo - dirac scenario . )",
    "we have studied the effect of these sterile neutrinos on the flux of cosmic neutrinos and discussed the capability of icecube to verify the existence of them . in the analysis",
    "we have considered different cases corresponding to the existence of sterile neutrinos degenerate in mass with different @xmath228 such that the oscillatory terms driven by these mass squared differences can be averaged out .",
    "the detection power of icecube ( and other proposed km@xmath17 neutrino telescopes ) , in the range of neutrino energies 100  gev  @xmath229  tev , is limited to distinguishing two types of events : @xmath3-track and shower - like events .",
    "we have considered the ratio of these events , @xmath166 in eq .",

    "we have studied the possibility of using the measured value of @xmath166 as a discriminator between the pseudo - dirac scenario and the scenario with no sterile neutrinos .",
    "we have considered various sources of uncertainties in our analysis .",
    "one part of these uncertainties comes from the imprecision of the neutrino oscillation experiments in the determination of mixing parameters . for this part we considered two sets of uncertainty intervals for the mixing parameters : i ) the current uncertainty intervals from the performed experiments ; and ii ) the future uncertainty intervals that will be achieved in the forthcoming experiments .",
    "both of these sets have been depicted in table  [ para ] . among the mixing parameters ,",
    "the measurable quantity @xmath166 is most sensitive to the exact value of the mixing angle @xmath230 . for the uncertainty of this parameter we have used the 6  % precision on @xmath231 @xcite depicted in table .",
    "the other part of uncertainties comes from the not completely known mechanism of neutrino production in the sources .",
    "many models of neutrino production predict a power - law spectrum for the cosmic neutrinos .",
    "however , the value of the spectral index in the power - law spectrum depends on the details of the neutrino production mechanism and can take values in the interval @xmath179 .",
    "also , the ratio of the number of electron anti - neutrinos to the number of electron neutrinos is not known .",
    "we have taken into account all these uncertainties in our analysis .",
    "the analysis has been done for two different initial flavor composition @xmath138 at the source : i ) pion source @xmath205 ; and ii ) stopped - muon source @xmath184 .",
    "it has been shown that with a higher precision of the mixing angles achievable in the forthcoming oscillation experiments , in certain cases it is possible to demonstrate or rule out the existence of sterile neutrinos hypothesized in the pseudo - dirac scenario . in these cases",
    "the regions corresponding to existence and absence of sterile neutrinos are well - separated in the parameter space for neutrinos coming from pion sources .",
    "for example , it is very promising to probe the case of two sterile neutrinos with masses almost degenerate with @xmath126 and @xmath123 ( see fig .",
    "( [ 120new]-f ) ) . for neutrinos coming from stopped - muon sources ,",
    "these regions mostly overlap such that their discrimination can not be done without ambiguity .",
    "also , the robustness of these results has been tested against the uncertainties in the initial flavor ratio of neutrinos at the source .",
