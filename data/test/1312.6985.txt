    "in the past few years , great efforts have been devoted to a new two - dimensional material , i.e. , monolayer mos@xmath0@xcite since it has a direct gap at k(k@xmath1 ) point,@xcite valley - dependent interband optical selection rule,@xcite and also good spin properties.@xcite specifically , both the conduction and valence bands are spin splitted caused by the space inversion asymmetry.@xcite this spin splitting at k(k@xmath1 ) point has opposite signs due to the time reversal symmetry , which makes the spintronics intriguing in this multivalley system .",
    "spin relaxation , which is one of the prerequisites in realizing spintronic devices , has been studied in monolayer mos@xmath0 very recently.@xcite there exist both the intravalley@xcite and intervalley@xcite spin relaxation processes . specifically , ochoa and roldn@xcite investigated the intravalley electron relaxation process for in - plane spins due to what they claimed dyakonov - perel@xcite ( dp ) and elliot - yafet@xcite ( ey ) mechanisms .",
    "however , the intravalley dp spin relaxation process contributed by the disorder is in fact absent since the isotropic low - energy two - band hamiltonian,@xcite i.e. , @xmath2 is employed in their calculation.@xcite here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the pauli matrices for two bloch basis functions and spins , respectively ; @xmath5 ; valley index @xmath6 represents k(k@xmath1 ) valley ; @xmath7 is the energy gap ; @xmath8 is the strength of the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) of the valence band .",
    "this isotropic hamiltonian can lead to the intravalley spin relaxation in the presence of the electron - electron coulomb and intravalley electron - phonon scatterings .",
    "these scatterings are unfortunately absent in ref .  .",
    "in addition , according to the latest report by rostami _",
    "et al._,@xcite the isotropic two - band hamiltonian becomes anisotropic when higher order terms in the momentum are taken into account .",
    "specifically , @xmath9 in which the last term is anisotropic .",
    "this anisotropic term can cause the dp spin relaxation together with the electron - impurity scattering .",

    "it is noted that only the anisotropic cubic term causes the dp spin relaxation with the electron - impurity scattering .",
    "in addition to the dp mechanism , we also include the ey one .",
    "however , the contribution of the ey mechanism to the in - plane spin relaxation is negligible compared with that of the dp one due to the marginal in - plane spin mixing . in the framework of the dp mechanism , we find that the intravalley process plays a more important role at low temperature .",
    "however , at high temperature , the intervalley process becomes more important .",
    "as for the temperature in between , we find that the leading process of the spin relaxation changes from the intervalley to intravalley one with increasing electron density .",
    "moreover , we find that the electron - electron coulomb scattering dominates the intravalley process even in the presence of high impurity density , due to the negligible inhomogeneous broadening from the anisotropic term in the soc .",
