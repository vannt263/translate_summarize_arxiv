    "the nonequilibrium properties of strongly correlated electron systems are a challenging subject in need of a better understanding . while experimental studies in this area face difficulties in the solid state context , ultracold quantum gases provide a controlled way to address this difficult issue .",
    "for this reason , recent experiments employing out - of - equilibrium cold atom gases in optical lattices , which allows the realization of model hamiltonians for strongly correlated particles ( for a review , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , have attracted considerable attention @xcite .    among the fundamental questions recently addressed in these experiments",
    "is the issue of thermalization in isolated quantum systems @xcite . in the transient regime , quantum quenches",
    "have been shown to induce a collapse and revival of coherence properties @xcite , and transport measurements in different lattice systems have unveiled the intriguing consequences of strong correlations @xcite .",
    "the important effects of interactions have been observed in the expansion of bosons in one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattices as well @xcite . in the expansion from a mott insulator ( mi ) state ,",
    "quasi - condensates at finite momenta emerge @xcite , while in the hard - core regime , the expansion from a superfluid state leads to the dynamical fermionization of the bosonic momentum distribution function ( mdf ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is a generic feature of the expansion of harmonically trapped hard - core bosons in the absence of a lattice @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , independently of the initial interaction strength , a freely expanding lieb - liniger gas always enters a strongly correlated ( hard - core like ) regime .",
    "the expansion dynamics of strongly correlated fermions , which due to the spin - degree of freedom is expected to be richer , has not yet been addressed , and it is the objective of this work .",
    "concretely , we study the expansion of two - component interacting fermions in a 1d lattice . the ground state physics of these systems is characterized by a tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) state with power - law decaying correlations at any incommensurate filling . at half - filling ,",
    "a charge gap opens and the system exhibits quasi long - range antiferromagnetic correlations @xcite . here , we wish to elucidate how the initial state of the system , being either mi or tl , affects the expansion process . identifying distinctive features for the mi",
    "is of much interest to experimentalists in the search for the fermionic mi state .",
    "however , our main objective is to shed light on the relation , if any , between these out - of - equilibrium systems and their equilibrium counterparts . as the main result of this work",
    ", we provide evidence that correlations measured in nonequilibrium are quantitatively described by appropriately chosen equilibrium reference systems .",

    ". we also comment on the validity of our findings in other models , such as the hubbard chain with a nearest - neighbor repulsion , which renders the model nonintegrable .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results contained in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamics is analyzed using the adaptive time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group method ( tdmrg ) @xcite .",
    "we consider the 1d hubbard model with nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath1 and an on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath2 : @xmath3 @xmath4(@xmath5 ) is a fermion creation(annihilation ) operator acting on site @xmath6 , with ( pseudo-)spin index @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the corresponding density operator , and we define @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the number of sites , @xmath11 is the lattice constant , and open boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "we prepare an initial state with a filling @xmath12 that is non - vanishing in only a portion of the system by applying a confining box - potential @xmath13 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath14 , with @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 otherwise . at time @xmath18 , we turn off @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is given in units of @xmath21 , we set @xmath22 to unity",
    ".    in our tdmrg runs we use a third - order trotter - suzuki time - evolution scheme with a time step of @xmath23 .",
    "the discarded weight during the time - evolution is kept below @xmath24 . to simulate the longest time scales possible on a given system size before",
    "the particles are reflected at the boundaries , we select an asymmetric set - up and , hence , particles can only expand into one direction .",

    "we further find that , for @xmath2 larger than the band - width @xmath39 , @xmath38 closely approaches @xmath40 .",
    "this behavior resembles that of hard- and soft - core bosons @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , we understand this in terms of an energy argument : in the mi state with @xmath41 , the total kinetic energy is close to zero .",
    "hence , particles emitted into an empty lattice have a small average kinetic energy corresponding to a momentum @xmath40 . as the fermi statistics prohibits quasi - condensation into a single momentum state",
    ", @xmath34 becomes a broad function around @xmath42 .    while the initial mi state is characterized by an exponential decay of one - particle correlations , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45 , @xmath46=const , we find that during the expansion , the system develops power - law correlations . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : nk_fermi](b ) , we compare the @xmath43 of a mi in equilibrium with the correlations that emerge during its expansion , measured within the moving cloud .",
    "the inset reveals the weak decay of correlations during the expansion , consistent with a power law .",
    "one may associate the dynamical emergence of this power law with a _ metallization _ of the moving cloud , which , after the melting of the mi , starts behaving as an inhomogeneous metal .",
    "as of now , our numerical analysis is restricted to a small number of particles and time scales of @xmath47 only , which prevents us from extracting , _",
    "e.g. _ , exponents of the power laws .",
    "note , though , that in the case of free fermions expanding from an insulating state with @xmath48 , _ i.e. _ , a state with no off - diagonal correlations , the emergence of power laws has been established for a large number of particles and hence over substantially larger distances than in the present work @xcite .         in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nk_fermi](b ) , we show the evolution of the mdf starting from a tl state with @xmath49 . in this case , the initial state has a well - defined fermi momentum and a power - law decay of correlations @xcite .",
    "such decay is preserved during the expansion .",
    "moreover , @xmath34 also exhibits a peak , but at a momentum @xmath50 ( @xmath38 increases as @xmath51 ) .",
    "another property of this peak , distinguishing it from the peak formed after the melting of the mi , is that it exhibits a much sharper edge at the large momentum side , reminiscent of a fermi edge .    from the previous analysis",
    ", we conclude that if @xmath34 could be experimentally studied during the expansion in the strongly correlated regime , then the emergence of peaks at @xmath52 in the fermionic mdf would serve to identify the presence of a mott insulator in the initial state .",
    "the experimental challenge is to independently control the trapping potential and the lattice @xcite .",
    "this has been achieved in the experimental study of disordered ultracold bose gases in both 1d optical lattices @xcite and homogeneous 1d systems @xcite .    at this point",
    "we would like to emphasize that the physics of our expanding system is different from the one found in theoretical studies of strongly correlated systems in 1d lattices undergoing a relaxation following a quantum quench @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "correlations have been found to decay faster than with a power law ( sometimes clearly exponentially ) @xcite , while in our moving clouds we find power - law decaying correlations [ inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : nk_fermi](b ) ] .",
    "in addition , after the relaxation to a steady state , one can ask the question of what statistical ensemble may best describe physical observables , but here we are solely concerned with the transient regime , _",
    "i.e. _ , a regime in which statistical ensembles do not provide us with insights into the behavior of physical observables .",
    "our results thus far have singled out a noticeable property of these systems during their expansion : independently of the initial ground state , power laws are observed in the nonequilibrium dynamics . in 1d systems in equilibrium ,",
    "power - law correlations are only seen in the ground state , as finite temperatures introduce a cut - off at large distances , followed by an exponential decay @xcite .",
    "hence , one may wonder whether a system out of equilibrium can in some way resemble the ground state of a system in equilibrium .",
    "a natural choice for such a reference state is the ground state of a system that has exactly the same density distribution as the time evolving state , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath53 for all sites @xmath6 . hence",
    ", a reference system has to be determined at each given time .",
    "we construct such reference states by self - consistently computing a set of onsite energies @xmath54 in @xmath55 with @xmath56 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) such that at a desired time , the density profile @xmath57 is reproduced , while keeping @xmath1 and @xmath2 fixed .",
    "once the density has converged within an error of @xmath58 we compare quantities of interest in both systems .",
    "we now turn to the comparative analysis of correlation functions .",
    "we compute the spin - spin ( @xmath59 ) and density - density ( @xmath60 ) structure factors , which are the fourier transforms of the spin - spin ( @xmath61 ) and density - density ( @xmath62 ) correlations , respectively .",
    "the spin operator is defined as @xmath63 . in equilibrium and for a homogeneous system , @xmath59 peaks at @xmath64 while @xmath60 exhibits a kink at @xmath65 @xcite , where @xmath66 is the fermi momentum .",
    "consistently , for the two cases @xmath48 and @xmath67 shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : n1](a ) and [ fig : n1](c ) , respectively , @xmath68 [ dotted lines ] peaks at @xmath69 and @xmath70 , while @xmath60 in the case of @xmath67 has a weak kink at @xmath71 [ dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1](d ) ] . during the expansion ,",
    "the peak in @xmath59 shifts to smaller momenta and the maximum is less sharp , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : n1](a ) and [ fig : n1](c ) [ solid lines ] .",
    "qualitatively , we understand this behavior in terms of the decrease of the average density during the expansion into the initially empty lattice , giving rise to a shift of the @xmath64 peak in @xmath59 and a broadening due to the inhomogeneity .",
    "further , we propose an operational definition of a fermi - momentum @xmath72 in the expanding clouds by taking the position of the peak in @xmath59 , yielding @xmath73 .",
    "this supports the use of the term `` metallization '' for the process that fermions escaping from a mi undergo .",
    "the density correlation @xmath60 does not show any particular features during the time - evolution , as the kink is washed out due to the inhomogeneity .",
    "@xmath60 increases monotonously with time , reflecting an increase of the overall charge fluctuations , due to the closing of the charge gap as the mi melts .",
    "our most remarkable finding , and thus the key result of this work , is the excellent agreement seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1 ] for @xmath59 and @xmath60 between the expanding cloud  a genuine nonequilibrium situation  and the inhomogeneous reference systems , which are in their ground state ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1 ] ) . we are therefore led to conclude that , during the expansion , spin and charge correlations out of equilibrium are , to a very good approximation , the same functionals of the density as the ones in equilibrium systems in the ground state .      intuitively , we expect that our way of preparing the reference systems must yield properties similar to those of the moving clouds on short time scales",
    ". however , the agreement between the clouds and the equilibrium systems exists both at short and long times , and is thus preserved during the expansion into the empty lattice . a noticeable difference exists between @xmath34 of the moving clouds and @xmath34 of the corresponding reference systems .",
    "as discussed before , @xmath34 of the expanding cloud has a finite - momentum maximum , which is also present in the symmetric expansion , while @xmath34 of the reference system in its ground state is symmetric around @xmath74 [ see dotted line in fig .  [",
    "fig : nk_fermi](b ) ] .",
    "hence , observables related to @xmath34 can not be accounted for with this procedure .",
    "our previous findings on the spin and density structure factors may seem puzzling : at any given time , the sum of the kinetic , @xmath75 , and interaction energy @xmath76 of the time - evolving state is much higher than the energy of the reference system , which , having the same density profile , is in its ground state .",
    "this difference grows with time . in the case of @xmath67 and @xmath27 , we have @xmath77 , which of course is a constant in time . at @xmath78 ,",
    "this splits into @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in contrast , for the reference system , we find @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , adding up to @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the main difference is due to the kinetic energies .     and ( b ) the potential energy @xmath84 for the expansion from an initial tl state with @xmath27 , @xmath67 ( dashed lines ) and the corresponding reference systems ( squares ) .",
    "the plot further shows the kinetic energy of the cloud as estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : est ] ) [ thick dotted line and stars ] as well as our approximate results for the kinetic energy @xmath85 associated with the center - of - mass motion of the cloud ( solid line ) . see text in sec .",
    "[ sec : erg ] for definitions and details .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we argue that both systems can be related by a galilean transformation and , thus , understand why their structure factors are similar .",
    "this means that the difference between the kinetic energies @xmath75 and @xmath86 is mainly due to the average momentum of the moving cloud [ @xmath87 , _",
    "i.e. _ , that @xmath88 , the latter being the kinetic energy of the particles in a reference frame moving with the cloud .",
    "to prove this , we first notice that , using the mdf , the kinetic energy can be estimated as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the dispersion relation in the noninteracting case .",
    "this assumption leads to @xmath91 and @xmath92 , as estimates for the kinetic energy of the expanding and reference systems at @xmath78 ( @xmath67 , @xmath27 ) , respectively .",
    "both values are very close to the exact results presented before .",
    "we then compute @xmath93 at @xmath78 , which corroborates our interpretation : the energy difference is mostly due to the finite momentum of the cloud , and not due to contributions of the internal kinetic or interaction energy . this picture",
    "is further supported by fig .",

    "let us start with the initial tl .",
    "we consider two cases : first , @xmath49 in a box trap [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : n1](d ) ] .",
    "second , as such a set - up is more realistic to account for experiments , we follow the evolution of fermions escaping from a harmonic trap @xmath104 . from the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : long](a ) , our key observation is that @xmath105 remains very small in both cases .",
    "hence , for an initial tl state and for both @xmath60 and @xmath59 , the description given by the equilibrium systems is very good up to the largest times simulated .",
    "we next turn to the case of an initial mi region , and present results in fig .",
    "[ fig : long](b ) for @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath107 case is treated with exact diagonalization , after mapping the charge sector of our two - component fermion system to spinless fermions @xcite .",
    "a behavior similar to the tl case is found at times @xmath108 , with @xmath109 . however , for times after the melting of the mi region [ @xmath110 , see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : long](b ) ] , a substantial increase of @xmath100 becomes evident , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : long](b ) .",
    "thus , for the mi expansion , reference systems work well only up to the point at which the mott insulator totally melts .",
    "this deviation of the time - dependent data from the reference systems is associated to the appearance of particular coherence properties in the portion left behind by the moving cloud after the melting of the mi , a feature that is not captured by the reference systems . to substantiate this interpretation , we present results for the decay of @xmath111 in the @xmath107 limit in fig .

    "here we focus on the numerically less demanding case of the expansion from an initial state with an incommensurate filling of @xmath67 .",
    "we postpone the discussion of the mdf to a future publication , but rather compute the spin and charge structure factors for both the expanding system and the reference systems constructed according to the prescription of sec .",

    "[ fig : nonint ] , and we note that in this case , we consider the expansion from a box trap only .",
    "our observation is that the reference systems still provide a very good approximation to the time - dependent correlations .",
    "moreover , the agreement remains to be much better for the spin structure factor than for the charge structure factor .",
    "future work will have to clarify whether the reference system description breaks down as @xmath135 is increased . in conclusion , we find that the reference system description does not seem to be crucially dependent on integrability , and we expect a similar picture to emerge in other models .",
    "our main results have shown that starting from a mott - insulator , the temporal evolution of spin and density correlation functions are very accurately described by the ground - state of reference systems defined at each instant of time so that they have the same density distribution as the time evolving system .",
    "such a description deteriorates after the mott insulating region has totally melted . on the other hand , for systems starting with densities @xmath136 ,",
    "the description with reference systems remains valid up to the largest times reached in our simulations .",
    "these results explicitely show that the correlation functions studied here are functionals of the density , a fact that is in accordance with density functional theory ( dft ) for time - dependent systems @xcite .",
    "dft considers , both for the ground state and time - dependent situations , this kind of hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath137 _ i.e. _ , one separates the hamiltonian into kinetic energy , the interaction energy due to coulomb interactions , and an external potential . we should here remark that in our case , the time - dependent external potential is discontinuous at time @xmath18 , as we use @xmath138 at time @xmath18 and @xmath139 for @xmath140 . therefore , it does not strictly comply with the assumptions needed to prove the runge - gross theorem @xcite , _ i.e. _ , the external potential needs to be analytical around @xmath18 .",
    "however , and most importantly , the reference systems explicitely provide the required functionals , namely the correlation functions in the respective ground - states .",
    "this is , to our opinion , a rather surprising and nontrivial fact that the correlations of a genuinely non - stationary state can be quantitatively described by equilibrium systems .",
    "moreover , since they are in their ground - state , this suggests that a minimum principle is at work here . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonint ] , these conclusions are not restricted to the pure hubbard - model , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are not a consequence of integrability .",
    "therefore , we expect that they hold in general .",

    "these include the emergence of coherence as well as well as an accumulation of particles at momentum @xmath40 in the expansion of particles coming from a mi region .",
    "in particular , we have shown that correlation functions of expanding , interacting fermions can be accurately described by equilibrium reference systems in their ground state .",
