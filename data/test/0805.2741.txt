    "the difference of 15% between the two different initial states can be explained by the higher localization of initial state 6 due larger energy mismatch of site 6 and target site 3**. * * an increase in reorganization energy results in an efficiency increase up to about 99% , demonstrating the effect of the environment - assisted quantum walk .",
    "as mentioned before the actual value of the irreversible transfer rate @xmath166 from the fmo complex to the reaction center ( acceptor ) is not well known * * , * * since there exists insufficient chrystallographic data for the combined fmo / rc structure @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) , we explore the dependence of the ete on this unknown parameter at room temperature**. * * the ete increases monotonically from zero to almost one within a range of five orders of magnitude .",
    "one obtains the largest increase in efficiency when the acceptor transfer rate is @xmath39ns@xmath9 thus surpasses the lifetime rate @xmath167 in the limit of large transfer rates to the acceptor , @xmath168 the lifetime of the excitation does not significantly reduce the efficiency . on the other hand , in the limit of small transfer rates to the acceptor , @xmath169 most of the excitation dissipates into the environment before being transferred to the acceptor .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ( d ) , shows the transfer time , eq .",
    "( [ transfertime eq ] ) , of the excitation initially at site 1 or 6 to the acceptor as a function of reorganization energy . in the fully quantum limit",
    "it takes the excitation more than 50ps to arrive at the acceptor .",
    "this value dramatically improves for higher reorganization energies .",
    "at the value of @xmath144cm@xmath9 one finds a transfer time of around 4ps@xmath170 which was reported based on different considerations in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] illustrates the susceptibilities @xmath171 for the basic processes in the fmo dynamics including the hamiltonian , the phonon bath coupling , transfer to the acceptor , and the loss of the excitation . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) , the susceptibilities for those processes are shown as a function of temperature .",
    "the susceptibility of the ete to the phonon bath shows several interesting features .",
    "the system is rather susceptible to perturbations of the phonon bath coupling at zero temperature . in this limit ,",
    "the directionality of the quantum walk is maximized , since , due to spontaneous emission , the excitation can only move down in energy towards the target site 3 while energy absorption from the phonon bath is suppressed .",
    "increasing temperature leads to increased stimulated emission _ and _ absorption , thus the system is less susceptible to perturbations of the phonon bath since their effect on emission and absorption processes is the same .",
    "concomitantly , the efficiency becomes more susceptible to the transfer process to the reaction center at higher temperature .",
    "this is again readily explained by the increased phonon - bath absorption rate : in the presence of detrapping processes it becomes more important to capture the excitation immediately once it arrives at site 3 .",
    "we note that the efficiency is not susceptible to a small variation of the free hamiltonian due to inherent irreversibility of the fully unitary quantum dynamics .",
    "the susceptibility with respect to dephasing in the energy basis has also insignificant variation for all the temperatures considered here due to the dominant role of the quantum jumps to the overall ete , and thus is not presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the dependence of the susceptibilities of the ete as a function of the reorganization energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) .",
    "the susceptibility of the ete to the phonon bath peaks at around 1cm@xmath9 for the initial state 1 and around 0.01cm@xmath9 for the initial state 6@xmath172 note that , for the ohmic spectral density considered here , the reorganization energy scales linearly the strength of the coupling to the phonon bath , therefore this curve is the derivative of the ete in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) , where the steepest ascent occurs around 1cm@xmath9 or 0.01cm@xmath9 respectively .",
    "the susceptibility of the ete on the transfer rate to the acceptor becomes smaller for higher reorganization energy .",
    "larger reorganization energy leads to faster thermalization . in this regime",
    "the system is more resilient to perturbations of the transfer process to the acceptor and the dissipation to the environment .",
    "the dependence of the susceptibility of the ete on the acceptor transfer rate is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( c ) .",
    "we observe a maximum in the susceptibility at around @xmath173ns@xmath9 , which is the regime where the time scales of transfer to the acceptor and the lifetime are comparable , @xmath174 , compare to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) .",
    "the susceptibilities of the energy transfer efficiency on inter - site quantum jumps is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) .",
    "more formally , we look at the effect of perturbations of site to site jump terms and the corresponding damping , @xmath175 in the quantum walk master eq .",
    "( transitionsupermatrix ) .",
    "we obtain a schematic picture of the most susceptible pathways in the fmo complex .",
    "the susceptibilities are correlated with the incoherent transport pathways .",
    "the susceptibilities are large when relaxation or absorption of energy due to the phonon bath is important for a particular transport pathway .",
    "this is the case e.g.  when there is a relatively large off - resonance between different sites and thus coherent coupling does not lead to significant overlap between the sites , for example for sites 3/7 . on the other hand , when coherent coupling is similar to the site - energy splitting , incoherent processes are less significant , leading to small susceptibilities such as for sites 1/2 and 5/6 . a positive ( negative ) susceptibility of a process @xmath176 indicates an increasing ( decreasing ) ete .",
    "for the fmo complex , jumps towards ( away from ) site 3 have positive ( negative ) susceptibility , a signature of the directionality in the irreversible dynamics .",
    "thus , the quantum walk formalism together with a rather straightforward measure of the energy transfer susceptibility provides a valuable method to investigate spatial exciton transfer pathways in multichromophoric arrays .",
    "we have developed a general theoretical framework within the lindblad formalism for studying the role of quantum effects in energy transfer dynamics of arbitrary chromophoric arrays interacting with a thermal bath from a microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "we have shown that a quantum walk approach , which has been widely used in quantum information science , provides an appropriate mathematical framework for studying energy transfer .",
    "we have generalized the concept of continuous - time quantum walks to non - unitary and temperature - dependent dynamics in liouville space .",
    "this approach can also be used to generally study decoherence effects in quantum walks in arbitrary geometries .",
    "the energy transfer efficiency was used as a universal measure to study the transfer properties of the environment - assisted quantum walk .",
    "we we have applied our method to explore the energy transfer efficiency and its susceptibilities for the fenna - matthews - olson protein complex as a function of temperature , reorganization energy , trapping rates , and quantum jumps . in particular",
    "the energy transfer susceptibilities were studied with respect to the free hamiltonian , the phonon bath , dephasing , trapping rate , and the exciton loss .",
    "this approach provides valuable insight into the dynamical role of various generators of the master equation and into spatial exciton transfer pathways in multichromophoric arrays .",
    "we have shown that the overall environment coupling strength leads to a substantial enhancement of the ete of about 25% for the fmo complex .",
    "thus , the overall energy transfer efficiency of 99% can be explained with the open nature of the multichromophoric dynamics involving an effective interplay between free hamiltonian and fluctuations in the protein and solvent .",
    "we applied the general formalism presented in this work to reveal the contributions of underlying physical mechanism to quantum transport @xcite .",
    "we also quantified the phenomena of environment - assisted quantum transport due to an effective interplay of quantum dynamical coherence and a pure - dephasing noise model @xcite . using pure dephasing model ,",
    "others observed similar effects @xcite .",
    "motivated by recent observations of non - local effects in the structure and the dynamics of the purple bacteria reaction center @xcite and the fmo protein @xcite , and also based on recent advances in the understanding and control of non - markovian open quantum systems @xcite , generalizations of our scheme to include environments with temporal and spatial correlations are currently underway .",
    "these results could lead to new ways for engineering optimal state transfer in quantum spin networks @xcite which interact with realistic environments .",
    "since we employ the lindblad equation , our quantum walk formalism can be implemented numerically using the monte carlo wavefunction ( mcwf )  approach .",
    "the mcwf method was originally developed for dissipative processes in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of mcwf  is the fact that one only needs to simulate the wave function rather than the density operator @xcite .",
    "our approach can potentially be used to enhance energy transfer efficiency via engineering quantum interference effects . for certain binary tree chromophoric arrays , e.g. , dendrimers , * *  * * quantum walks could lead to an exponential speed - up over classical walks of excitations @xcite .",
    "in general , the combined biology and quantum information inspired approach of this study could provide new insight for engineering artificial photosystems , such as quantum dots and dendrimers @xcite to achieve optimal energy transport by exploiting their environmental effects .",
