    "interest in spin-3 bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) has increased rapidly since the creation of a chromium condensate @xcite . in a chromium condensate",
    "the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction is much stronger than in alkali - metal atom condensates .",
    "therefore two interactions need to be considered : the short - range ( van der waals ) interaction modeled as a contact interaction , and the long - range magnetic dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the latter is known to enable conversion of spin angular momentum into orbital angular momentum , which makes possible the creation of vortex states via spin dynamics @xcite .",
    "the spin dynamics driven by the dipole - dipole interaction can be prevented by exposing the condensate to a strong external magnetic field , which suppresses the conversion of spin angular momentum into orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction also affects the expansion dynamics of a chromium condensate @xcite , allows a precise measurement of the scattering length @xcite , and opens the way for a new cooling method @xcite .",

    "the effect of the dipole - dipole interaction is the largest , but even then it is weaker than the van der waals interaction .",
    "therefore it has been neglected in the studies of the ground states of a @xmath0cr condensate @xcite .",
    "this simplifies the study of the system , as it allows one to concentrate on the effects of the contact interaction alone .",
    "since the contact interaction does not change the value of magnetization , the ground states should be calculated taking this into attention . for spin-1 condensate",

    "does not appear to be big enough to change the ground state of a chromium condensate .      in a high magnetic field the coherent spin relaxation via magnetic dipole - dipole interaction",
    "is suppressed .",
    "this occurs when the energy spacing of the neighboring zeeman levels , @xmath253 , is much larger than the chemical potential @xmath254 . for a chromium condensate of @xmath255 particles",
    "these energies are equal when @xmath256 mg .",
    "although coherent spin relaxation is prevented , spin relaxation can still occur via incoherent processes .",
    "in these the energy released in spin relaxation is so large that the colliding particles escape from the trap . for @xmath0cr",
    "this process has been studied both theoretically and experimentally in ref .",
    "for example for @xmath225 state at a magnetic field of @xmath153 g the rate constant @xmath257 characterizing inelastic dipolar relaxation was found to be @xmath258 @xmath259 s@xmath260 @xcite .",
    "thus for a typical central density @xmath261 @xmath262 the @xmath225 state decays in a few ms .",
    "this is a short time compared with the typical timescales of @xmath0cr experiments , which are on the order of tens of ms @xcite .",
    "one way to suppress the incoherent dipolar relaxation is to reduce the condensate density .",
    "this can be done by loading the condensate to an optical lattice of shallow traps @xcite .",
    "if one reduces the density , e.g. , by two orders of magnitude , the new decay time is on the order of hundreds of milliseconds , which should be long enough for experiments .",
    "from experimental point of view it is important to be able to produce different spinors as initial states .",
    "this can be done using rapid adiabatic passage and controlled landau - zener crossing techniques , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . for spin-1 and spin-2 @xmath219rb condensates",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "for @xmath239 , the ground state of @xmath0cr is very likely of the form @xmath263 .",
    "if a condensate is initially prepared in this state , it should not show any coherent spin dynamics . because of incoherent processes the populaton of the @xmath221 component decreases , while that of @xmath2 component is almost unchanged .",
    "this leads to a decrease of magnetization .",
    "if initially @xmath264 , at every later moment the condensate is in the instantaneous ground state of spin with magnetization @xmath264 .",
    "we have calculated the ground states and the ground - state phase diagrams of spin-3 becs using mean - field theory and single - mode approximation .",
    "we have assumed that the projection of the magnetization in the direction of the external magnetic field is a conserved quantity .",
    "we have presented the ground - state phase diagrams pertaining to several values of magnetization .",
    "the phase diagrams are classified by the value of @xmath134 , which is determined by the scattering lengths of different scattering channels .",
    "we found out that the phase diagrams with @xmath95 depend only weakly on the value of magnetization , whereas if @xmath89 the dependence is stronger .",
    "the phase diagrams for a @xmath86 condensate are obtained in a certain limit from the @xmath89 or the @xmath95 diagrams .",
    "we have plotted the ground states of @xmath0cr as a function of magnetization and the unknown scattering length @xmath39 .",
    "we found out that this resembles the phase diagram for a chromium condensate in a weak magnetic field , where the magnetization can vary freely .",
    "this follows from the fact that in the latter the magnetization of the ground state depends approximately linearly on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "we have also studied how the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction affects the ground states . in the absence of the dipole - dipole interaction it",
    "is possible to have ground states where the magnetization is not parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "we have showed that , instead of these states , the dipole - dipole interaction may favor ground states where the condensate has broken up into regions having the magnetization parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "we have illustrated that the ground state of @xmath0cr does not appear to depend on whether or not the contribution from the dipole - dipole interaction is included .",
    "finally we have discussed the experimental realization of spinor @xmath0cr condensates , pointing out that due to fast incoherent spin relaxation the condensate density should be decreased in order to make the lifetime of condensate long enough for experiments .",
