    "the direct observation of this radiation from comptel @xcite and integral @xcite instruments provides an evidence that @xmath6 production is still active on a large scale .",

    "stellar nucleosynthesis studies have not yet identified which one of the possible @xmath6 sources could explain the observed evidences .",
    "existing stellar models predict that 30 - 50% of the production of @xmath6 comes from hydrogen - burning shell ( hbs ) of massive stars ( core collapse supernovae and wolf - rayet stars ) .",
    "the remaining should come elsewhere , for example from hbs of low mass agb or from the nucleosynthesis of novae .",

    "the detector used was a hpge detector ( 119% efficiency ) , placed at @xmath21 relative to the beam direction .",
    "the distance between the target and the front face of the detector was 3.5 cm , in order to guarantee a high detection efficiency . due to this geometry",
    "significant corrections due to the summing effect had to be applied . the efficiency curve for the measurement of the e@xmath2= 189 kev resonance energy was determined using the @xmath22n(p,@xmath12)@xmath23o ( e@xmath2= 259 kev ) and @xmath24mg(p,@xmath12)@xmath17al ( e@xmath2= 224 kev ) reactions as well as @xmath25cs and @xmath26bi calibrated sources .",
