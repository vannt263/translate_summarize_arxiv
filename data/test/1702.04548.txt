    "many body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) diagrammatic approaches offer a path to the solution of the quantum many body problem of solids , which complements alternative methods such as qmc ( quantum monte carlo ) and cc ( couple cluster ) .",
    "this approach received attention for over half a century but there is no complete understanding of how different selection of diagrams performs for different physical quantities .",
    "these insights are important in the search for predictive first principles methods for correlated solids . in this work",
    "we investigate these questions in the framework of the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) in a neutralizing positively charged background .",
    "the heg is very useful for testing in a simplified setting the methods presently being developed to study the electronic structure of solids for two reasons : it requires less computational effort and there is a natural benchmark since some properties have also been calculated using qmc methods @xcite .",
    "this model describes well the properties of alkali metals .",
    "most common uses of diagrammatic approaches are based on non - interacting green functions such as a lda ( local density approximation ) green s function . in this work , however , we are interested in self consistent ( sc ) diagrammatic approaches",
    ". hence we do not consider ambiguities related to the choice of the non interacting green function for reference .",
    "we consider two classes of methods .",
    "one initiated by hedin@xcite , which carries out a perturbative expansion in the fully self consistent ( renormalized ) green function which obeys the dyson equation and in screened interaction w. an alternative philosophy ( qsgw ) uses the lowest order diagrams for the polarizability and the self energy with a green s function which is determined by means of a quasi - particle self consistency condition @xcite . in this work",
    "we perform qsgw calculations using a previously introduced linearized approach@xcite that has an advantage of being implementable on matsubara frequencies .",
    "an important cornerstone in the application of the self - consistent mbpt - based approximations to the heg is the work by holm and von barth @xcite where the authors applied scgw approximation ( i.e. lowest order diagram in the perturbation series in terms of g and w ) to calculate the total energy and spectra of the heg .",
    "their principal conclusions are that scgw severely overestimates the band width but gives the total energy very close to the qmc results .",
    "thus , the work @xcite raised the question of how ( if at all ) one can get accurate spectra of the heg using scmbpt approach .",
    "progress on this question was made by shirley @xcite who showed that if an accurate w is known ( he used qmc input to evaluate w ) then the self - consistency in the green s function g and the lowest order vertex corrections in the self energy mostly cancel out each other justifying in a certain degree the so called one - shot @xmath0 approaches ( lowest order approach using a non interacting greens function @xmath1 ) without vertex corrections to the self energy .",
    "takada @xcite used qmc data to parametrize electron - hole four - point irreducible interaction and performed sc vertex - corrected gw calculations with the vertex defined from a condition that the ward identity ( wi ) is satisfied . in this respect",
    "his approach resembles the idea of qsgw method where wi is imposed by construction .",
    "the importance of vertex corrections in electron gas studies was reported recently in non - self - consistent calculations.@xcite from other studies on the subject , one should mention the work [ ] , where the spectral properties of the electron gas were studied with ab - initio coupled - cluster theory .    in this study",
    "we go beyond the earlier diagrammatically inspired works by removing the important limitation related to the use of monte - carlo data for the parametrization of the screened interaction or the electron - hole four - point irreducible interaction .",
    "we examine the fully self - consistent ( in both g and w ) diagrammatic schemes involving diagrams of higher order .",
    "we study the relative importance of different diagrams for the polarizability and the self energy .",
    "the paper begins with a brief presentation of the self - consistent schemes we use to solve the hedin s equations ( section [ meth ] ) .",
    "section [ res ] provides the results obtained and a discussion .",
    "the conclusions are given afterwords .",
    "detailed account of the vertex - corrected schemes we use in this work has been given before in ref .",
    "[ ] . for completeness , below we briefly repeat the essentials of the approach and point out the simplifications in technical implementation in the case of the electron gas .",
    "we solve the hedin s equations @xcite self - consistently using different approximations for the three point vertex function @xmath2 .",
    "the three point vertex function enters the formally exact expressions for the polarizability and the self energy ( in space - time variables )    @xmath3    @xmath4    where the integration / summation over repeated arguments is understood , and @xmath5 is the spin index .",
    "we consider two different types of approximations for @xmath2 .",
    "the first type consists in expanding the vertex function in terms of the screened interaction to a specified order .",
    "keeping only zero order term ( @xmath6 ) in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 corresponds to the famous gw approximation .",
    "we will also consider the expansion of the vertex up to the first order ( @xmath9 ) in both the polarizability and the self energy expressions .",
    "this approximation is conserving ( like gw ) as the corresponding p and @xmath8 can alternatively be obtained by differentiating the same @xmath10-functional @xcite .",
    "the second type of approximation for @xmath2 consists in solving the bethe - salpeter equation @xmath11 with a certain approximate expression for the functional derivative @xmath12 in ( [ vert_0 ] ) .",
    "we will consider two expressions for the kernel @xmath13 in this work .",
    "the first is obtained by using the gw form for @xmath8 in the functional derivative and neglecting the derivative of the screened interaction @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 ( we will call the corresponding vertex as @xmath16 ) .",
    "diagrammatically it corresponds to keeping only the first term on the right hand side of fig.[theta_appr ] . in the second approximate expression for @xmath13",
    "we also are using the gw form for the self energy in the functional derivative but we keep the terms up to the second order in @xmath17 in the derivative @xmath14 ( we will use abbreviation @xmath18 for the corresponding vertex ) . in this case , the obtained vertex function corresponds to keeping all three terms for @xmath13 ( fig.[theta_appr ] ) .",
    "it is important to point out that the diagrams resulted from @xmath14 allow the spin flips ( as it is clear from fig.[theta_appr ] ) , the importance of which was pointed out in ref .",
    "[ ] .    .,width=7 ]    in the particular case , when g and w have been found self - consistently with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the vertex @xmath18 yields the physical polarizability in scgw approximation ( defined as a functional derivative of electronic density with respect to the total electric field ) .",
    "in other cases , when @xmath18 is evaluated with @xmath8 and/or @xmath7 including additional diagrams , the kernel shown in fig .",
    "[ theta_appr ] is only an approximation to the derivative @xmath21 , and as a result , the vertex @xmath18 does nt provide physical @xmath7 anymore .",
    "essentially , in a search for an optimal approximation , we have to trade between the accuracy of @xmath8 in the dyson equation for @xmath22 ( which is generally better when we increase the number of diagrams beyond simple @xmath19 ) and the degree of the `` deviation '' of the polarizability from the physical one .",
    ".diagrammatic representations of the polarizability and the self energy in sc schemes of solving the hedin equations .",
    "arguments in square brackets specify @xmath22 and @xmath17 which are used to evaluate the vertex function .",
    "other details are explained in the main text . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ bw_comp ]",
    "we compare our results for the band width with those obtained by shirley @xcite , who based the calculations ( partially ) on qmc input .",
    "band width was determined as the difference between the pole in the spectral function at * * k**=0 and chemical potential .",
    "if we assume that shirley s results are close to the exact ones , we can draw certain conclusions about our approaches .",
    "as one can conclude from the table , three schemes ( d , e , and g ) show the best performance with small difference between themselves .",
    "common for these three schemes are two facts : they all include the solving of the bethe - salpeter equation for the polarizability ( but slightly differently as it was explained above ) and they all apply first order vertex correction in the self energy .",
    "scheme c also involves the solving of bse for the polarizability , but it does nt use vertex correction to the self energy and , as a result , shows worse performance .",
    "similarly , the conserving scheme b , which applies first order vertex corrections to the @xmath7 and @xmath8 , shows worse performance , because it misses the effects of bse in the w. nevertheless , scheme b seems to be better than scheme c , demonstrating the importance of vertex corrections in the self energy .",
    "the performance of qsgw approach is slightly better than performance of scgw , but it is not competitive with schemes d , e , or g. thus , for the studied range of densities of the electron gas , qsgw can not be considered as a reasonable approximation in terms of its predictive power .",
    ".,width=8 ]     obtained with different approximations in comparison with qmc result@xcite .",
    "the results based on local field factors ( lff ) are taken from the ref.[].,width=8 ]    .",
    "the results based on local field factors ( lff ) are taken from the ref.[].,width=8 ]    summarizing our results for one - electron properties , we show them ( for the purpose of reference ) for the spectrum ( @xmath23=3 ) , quasiparticle renorm - factor z and effective electron mass @xmath24 in figures [ bw ] , [ z_factor ] , and [ m_eff ] correspondingly .",
    "the spectrum was defined as the positions of the poles in spectral function ( for every * k * ) . in order to evaluate the renorm - factor and the effective mass",
    ", we used the formulae ( with @xmath25 being the fermi momentum and @xmath26 being the chemical potential ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspondingly . for z - factor",
    "there are qmc data @xcite but the data involve extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit and do not look as accurate enough .",
    "instead , we compare our results with the ones based on local field factors ( lff ) @xcite which include certain amount of qmc input .",
    "it is interesting that the dependence on @xmath23 of the effective mass is weaker than similar dependence of the z - factor suggesting that the frequency derivative and momentum derivative in eq.([ms ] ) are canceling out considerably .    .",
    "comparison with qmc data from ref .",
    "schemes c and d give identical results for this quantity.,width=8 ]    in figure [ e1_4 ] the static ( zero - frequency ) inverse dielectric function for 3d electron gas is shown for @xmath29 .",
    "as one can see from the graph we are able to improve the agreement with qmc data considerably when using the vertices of increased complexity .",
    "clearly , the best dielectric function is obtained from the `` physical '' polarizability ( schemes c and d ) , even if the last corresponds to the scgw approximation ( in the sense that the diagrams are evaluated using g and w from scgw ) .",
    "one can also point out the importance of including the diagrams with spin flips ( scheme e results in better dielectric function than scheme g does ) . at the same time scheme e is worse than schemes",
    "c / d which reflects the above mentioned fact about trading - additional diagram in the self energy in scheme e violates the requirement of the polarizability to be physical .",
    "one can also relate the shortcomings of qsgw approach in the one - electron spectra to the poor description of the screening .",
    "as one can see from figure [ e1_4 ] , in the physically important range ( @xmath30=0.5 - 3.0 ) the inverse dielectric function in qsgw approximation is larger than the one from qmc data by a factor 2 - 3 .    .",
    "@xmath31 is the compressibility of the non - interacting electron gas . to make the plot",
    ", we used the vertex @xmath32 in schemes c , d , and e , and the vertex @xmath33 in scheme g.,width=8 ]     at small @xmath34 for @xmath29 .",
    "symbols @xmath35 show the calculated data points , line is drawn for convenience.,width=8 ]    in fig.[compress ] we compare our calculated compressibilities with the results based on the qmc data .",
    "we have obtained the qmc compressibility @xmath36 as the derivative of the chemical potential @xmath26 ( @xmath37 ) with respect to @xmath23 : @xmath38 . in our vertex - corrected schemes ,",
    "we have evaluated the compressibility from the ratio of two limits of the vertex function ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) and the effective mass @xmath24 ( see for instance ref . [ ] )    @xmath41    the two limits of the vertex function , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , were defined as follows . in the momentum - frequency representation , the vertex function ( solution of the eq.([vert_0 ] ) )",
    "can be conveniently considered as dependent on fermionic momentum+frequncy ( * k*,@xmath42 ) and on bosonic momentum+frequency ( * q*,@xmath34 ) , i.e. @xmath2(*k*,@xmath42;*q*,@xmath34 ) . in these variables , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with two vectors , * k * and * q * , assumed to be parallel .",
    "quantities @xmath39 and @xmath40 are related to the quasiparticle renormalization factor @xmath45 and the landau fermi liquid parameter @xmath46 : @xmath47 , @xmath48 . in order to demonstrate that the above two limits are well defined numerically",
    ", we have plotted the vertex function @xmath32 from scheme d in the fig.[vrt_plot ] .",
    "the limit @xmath39 corresponds to the value of the function at @xmath49 exactly ( approximately 4.58 on the graph ) .",
    "the limit @xmath40 corresponds to the extrapolation of the function to zero frequency ( approximately 1.31 on the graph ) . for the purpose of reference , the calculated fermi liquid parameter @xmath46",
    "is shown in fig.[f0s ] .",
    "again , the limits @xmath39 and @xmath40 have been used to obtain the data for the plot .     of the electron gas calculated with vertex - corrected schemes.,width=8 ]",
    "it is clear from the figure [ compress ] that the behavior consistent with the presence of the pole in the compressibility ( at about @xmath50 , `` dielectric catastrophe''@xcite ) can only be obtained based on the vertex from schemes c and/or d. in other words , only the vertex corresponding to the physical polarizability can be useful in reproducing the qmc compressibility .",
    "it is interesting , that the additional self - consistency iterations for the vertex function in schemes e and g ( as compared to scheme d ) which only slightly change the one - electron spectra , worsen significantly the quality of the calculated compressibility .",
    "also , it is obvious that the first order vertex ( scheme b ) is totally insensitive to the presence of a pole in the compressibility .    ) as a function of bosonic momentum * q * for @xmath29 .",
    "fermionic frequency and momentum correspond to their values at the fermi surface .",
    "schemes c and d give identical results for this quantity.,width=8 ]    an additional insight on the origin of differences in the dielectric function obtained with approximate methods can be gained when one looks at the static vertex as a function of bosonic momentum ( fig .",
    "[ vrt_stat ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the range of momenta where the calculated dielectric function shows the largest differences ( @xmath51 ) correlates very well with the range of momenta where the humps in the vertex function show very different heights .",
    ".,width=8 ]    in fig.[e_c ] we present the calculated correlation energy of the electron gas as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "it was obtained as the difference between the expectation value of the hamiltonian corresponding to the selected level of approximation and the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the hartree - fock approximation . in all vertex - corrected schemes",
    "the exchange - correlation part was evaluated as a convolution of the green s fucntion and the self energy . excluding scheme c which misses the vertex correction to the self energy and , as a result , shows rather different from other schemes behavior",
    ", one can conclude that vertex corrections do not improve the result obtained in scgw approach . only at @xmath23 less than 2",
    "there is a small improvement .",
    "however , the description of the slope of the curve is improved .",
    "it is especially easy to see in fully self - consistent schemes b , e , and g. for these three schemes there is an almost @xmath23-independent deviation from qmc data , the origin of which is not clear at the moment .",
    "in conclusion we have applied the self - consistent diagrammatic approaches based on the hedin equations to study the properties of the 3d heg .",
    "we have found , that the inclusion of the most important diagrammatic sequences can reproduce with a good accuracy the one - electron spectra and dielectric properties of the heg in the range of metallic densities .",
    "for the one - electron spectra , the corrections to the polarizability and to the self energy are equally important . for the dielectric properties",
    "the vertex correction to the self energy is of secondary importance . in all cases ,",
    "the important conclusion is that the calculation of the polarizability should follow , as close as possible , its definition as a functional derivative of the density with respect to the total electric field .",
    "our conclusions concerning one - electron spectra of 3d electron gas are similar to the conclusions made earlier for the spectra of alkali metals and semiconductors in refs .",
