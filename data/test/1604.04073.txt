    "references @xcite provide simple rules to properly tune the ltva parameters , while references @xcite study the post - bifurcation behavior of the coupled system . in @xcite , a nonlinear damping element was added in parallel with the ltva to decrease the maximum lco amplitude .",
    "other nonlinear vibration absorbers , including the autoparametric vibration absorber @xcite , the nonlinear energy sink ( nes ) @xcite and the hysteretic tuned vibration absorber @xcite , have also been considered to increase the effectiveness of vibration attenuation . in particular",
    ", the nes exhibited three different mechanisms to suppress lcos , namely complete , partial and intermittent suppression .",
    "these mechanisms were studied numerically @xcite , experimentally @xcite and analytically @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this study is to utilize the nonlinear tuned vibration absorber ( nltva ) for lco suppression .",
    "this absorber , first introduced in @xcite , possesses a linear spring and a nonlinear spring whose mathematical form is determined according to the nonlinearity in the host system . following references @xcite , the linear spring coefficient is determined to maximize the stable region of the trivial solution of the host system .",
    "subsequently , the nonlinear spring is designed to ensure supercritical behavior and to mitigate the lcos in the postcritical range .",
    "a fundamental result of this paper is that , if properly designed , the linear and nonlinear springs of the nltva can complement each other giving rise to a very effective lco suppression and management strategy .",
    "the example that will serve to validate the proposed developments is the van der pol  duffing ( vdpd ) oscillator @xcite , which is a paradigmatic model for the description of self - excited oscillations . the bifurcation behavior of the vdpd oscillator was studied in @xcite whereas its stabilization using active control was proposed in @xcite .",

    "loss of stability occurs through either a supercritical or a subcritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "this latter scenario is dangerous , because stable large - amplitude lcos can co - exist with the stable equilibrium point @xcite .",
    "the objective of the present study is to mitigate , or even completely eliminate , the lcos of the vdpd oscillator through the attachment of a fully passive nonlinear vibration absorber , termed the nltva @xcite .",
    "one salient feature of the nltva compared to existing nonlinear absorbers is that the absorber s load - deflection curve is not imposed a priori , but it is rather synthesized according to the nonlinear restoring force of the primary system .",

    "<S> the objective of the present study is to mitigate , or even completely eliminate , the limit cycle oscillations in mechanical systems using a passive nonlinear absorber , termed the nonlinear tuned vibration absorber ( nltva ) . </S>",
    "<S> an unconventional aspect of the nltva is that the mathematical form of its restoring force is not imposed a priori , as it is the case for most existing nonlinear absorbers . </S>",
    "<S> the nltva parameters are determined analytically using stability and bifurcation analyses , and the resulting design is validated using numerical continuation . </S>",
