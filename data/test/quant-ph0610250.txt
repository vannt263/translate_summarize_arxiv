    "recently , all - optical and on - chip setups with the coupled resonator optical waveguide ( crow ) have been implemented experimentally to show the coherent transmission of slow photons \" @xcite , which is similar to the electromagnetical induced transparency ( eit ) effect @xcite occurring in the atomic ensemble medium .",
    "this successful experiment implies the coherent couplings of the single mode cavities fanprl04 , which result in the photonic - crystal - like system with photonic band structure . for practical applications such as crow setup",
    "they can be utilized to stop or store the light pulses propagation and then lead to a quantum device based on these many - body effects , which can also be regarded as a tunable quantum simulator for the tight binding fermion system in condensed matter physics .    on the other hand , recently it was discovered @xcite that , when such an array of coupled cavities is doped with two - level atoms , the photon - blockaded phenomenon can emerge and achieve a mott insulator state of polaritons that are many - body dressed states of doped atoms coupled to quantized modes of optical field in the crow .",
    "most interestingly , such a hybrid system with a two - dimensional array of coupled optical cavities in the photon - blockaded regime will undergo a quantum phase transition from characteristic mott insulator ( excitations localized on each site ) to superfluid ( excitations delocalized across the lattice ) @xcite .",
    "a similar coplanar hybrid structure based on superconducting circuit has been proposed for the coherent control of microwave - photons propagating in a coupled transmission line resonator ( ctlr ) waveguide . here , each cavity is coupled to a tunable charge qubit @xcite . while the ctlr forms an artificial photonic crystal with an engineered band structure ,",
    "the charge qubits collectively behave as spin waves in the low - excitation limit , and these charge qubits modify the photonic band with energy gaps to slow or even stop the microwave propagation in this ctlr waveguide .",
    "the conceptual exploration here suggests an electromagnetically controlled quantum device based on the on - chip circuit for the coherent manipulation of photons , such as the dynamic appearances of the laser - like output from ctlr waveguide where the atoms are pumped for some population inversion .",
    "these progressing investigations motivate us to further develop the general theoretical approach for cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) with coupled resonators for coherent manipulations of photon transmission in an artificial photonic band structure , which can be controlled through some new mechanisms . in ref.@xcite",
    "we provide an approach based on the mean filed method and spin wave theory et al for different hybrid structures , which consist of the coupled cavity arrays with homogeneous ( or inhomogeneous ) couplings and various multi - level - atom doping .",
    "the present paper adopts the two - time green function approach to study the coherent transmission of photons in a crow with homogeneous couplings , each cavity is doped to a two - level artificial atom .",
    "mathematically the hybrid system has the same model as that for ctlr waveguide connected to charge qubits@xcite , but the green function can work well for the system which does not satisfy the low - excitation limit , in which we can even obtain exact solution @xcite .",
    "we calculate the two - time retarded green function for photons in the weak - coupling case .",
    "its poles predict the exact dispersion relation , according to which the group velocity can be coherently controlled by the collective excitation of the doping atoms .",
    "we emphasize the role of the population inversion of the total doping atoms , which is induced by some polarization or pump mechanism .",
    "the dispersion relation exhibits some exotic features such as the compressed photonic bandwidth .",
    "the paper is organized as followed . in section",

    "iv we study how the bandwidth and group velocity of photon transmission can be adjusted by controlling the doped atoms .",
    "then we consider the effects of damping in both the local mode of cavity and doped atoms .",
    "the stable atomic collective excitations can result in the coherent output of slow photons with some laser - like properties . in section",
    "v , for the phenomenon of slow photons we study the effective susceptibility of light propagation in the crow interacting with doping atoms . in the appendices we give some necessary details for the green function calculations and analyze the quasi - spin wave structure represented by the green functions for photons and atoms that we have obtained .",

    ", the absorption directly depends on the wave vector @xmath44 . at the same time we can imagine that the character of absorption can influence the group velocity of photons .",
    "it is obvious to see that an unavoidable loss effect appears for the group velocity when the atom media absorbs light strongly .",
    "the dispersion relation of photons is described by @xmath261 , from which we calculate the group velocity as@xmath262 but from eq.([absorption ] ) it can be seen that the media absorption characterized by @xmath256 , will be stronger when @xmath263 becomes smaller . in other words , the considerable absorption corresponds to a slow group velocity .",
    "actually , since the effect of the group velocity is due to a spectrum structure of the wave vector @xmath44 , only a small range of @xmath44 around the point corresponding to the minimum group velocity , avoided is the higher order dispersion .",
    "the the point of minimum group velocity and the point of maximum absorption are related and somewhat close .",
    "this fact means that there is some unavoidable loss .",
    "we have studied the coherent transmission of photons with local modes along the crow coupled to artificial two - level atoms . under the weak - coupling limit , we use the stimulated raman excitation to tune the level spacing of the effective two - level system so that the properties of photons in the crow can be manipulated coherently . as the above results display ,",
    "if we prepare the hybrid system as that @xmath264 or @xmath265 the group velocity of photons in the doped crow will reach maximum under the two cases .",
    "meanwhile the two eigenfrequencies of the hybrid system have preference that , while one tends to the frequency of photons , another tends to that of quasi - spin wave of the total atoms . by controlling the average population of the doping atoms in the crow with decay , we predict that the laser - like output may occur . with such an exotic photonic band structure ,",
    "the light with different @xmath44 has different properties of absorption .    in @xcite about control of photon transmission in crow by doping artificial atoms for various hybrid structures , we study the case of the resonate three - level doping atoms by making use of the quasi - spin wave theory based on a mean field method .",
    "this investigation will make a corporate effort for the coherent transmission of photons in an artificial structure , where both the eit effect and the band - like structure are utilized simultaneously .",
