    "in search for unusual magnetic ground states and spin dynamics , frustrated systems have been the main focus of both theoretical and experimental investigations in recent years.@xcite in frustrated magnetic systems,@xcite the energies of the various spin interactions compete and therefore they can not be simultaneously minimized . this competition can be induced by the geometry of the lattice on which the spins are arranged , in which case the phenomenon is called _ geometrical frustration _ and it often leads to quite unusual low temperature spin structures and dynamics .",
    "the nearest neighbor ( nn ) heisenberg antiferromagnet ( af ) on the corner - sharing kagom lattice is one of the most studied systems since it has all the ingredients such as low dimensionality , strong frustration , and low coordination number , required for a disordered `` spin liquid '' ground state.@xcite     ( color online ) three possible nel states of the kagom lattice nn af : ( a ) * q*=0 with positive chirality , ( b ) * q*=0 with negative chirality , and ( c ) @xmath3 structure . the plus / minus signs indicate the chirality of spins on the elemental triangles .",

    "the initial experimental studies were focused on the layered garnet , srcr@xmath6ga@xmath7o@xmath8.@xcite however the interpretation of the magnetic properties of this system were complicated by the presence of an additional triangular lattice interposed between kagom layers and by the inherent configurational randomness associated with the random alloying . in recent years , it has been shown that the jarosite family of minerals @xmath9,@xcite ( where a is monovalent ion such as k@xmath10 , and m is trivalent cation such as fe@xmath11 , cr@xmath11 , or v@xmath11 ) form much better realization of the two dimensional ( 2d ) kagom lattice .",

    "et al._@xcite    in order to identify the origin of the magnetic interactions that are responsible for the lro in fej compounds , clearly we need more experimental data such as the observed spin - wave spectrum .",

    "the observed gaps at the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 points are best explained by considering only the dm interaction with @xmath365 mev and @xmath366 mev together with nn and nnn interactions .",
