    "the aim of this paper is to critically reconsider the physical origin of the onset of dynamical arrest and the associated crossovers between distinct dynamical regimes displayed by liquids supercooled through their melting temperature towards the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "we do this by extending the real space theoretical framework based on dynamic facilitation of refs.@xcite to the moderately supercooled regime corresponding to the region where mode coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite supposedly applies , as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "this novel approach takes directly into account the spatial aspects of the dynamics , in particular those related to dynamic heterogeneity @xcite , in contrast with many other theories @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that the onset of slowing down can be understood in a simple physical way in terms of the dynamical properties of effective excitations , or defects , as a progressive crossover from a regime of fast dynamics dense in defect clusters , to one of slow heterogeneous dynamics dominated by isolated localized defects .",
    "we demonstrate that this real space picture explains the observed crossover temperatures , challenges the idea that these crossovers are related to changes in the topography of the energy surface or to mct singularities , and is able to account for the apparent correlations observed between `` landscape '' and dynamical properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the rest of the introduction we review the mct and energy landscape points of view ,",
    "discuss their problems and limitations , and describe the alternative real space perspective we will pursue . in section [ physics ]",
    "we develop the physical picture of the onset of slowing down and dynamical crossovers which emerges from our theoretical approach . in section [ consequence ]",
    "we discuss its quantitative consequences and compare them to published numerical results . in section [ landscape ] we show how our approach also enables to derive the observed properties of the potential energy landscape of supercooled liquids . finally , in section",
    "[ conclusion ] we discuss our results and state our conclusions .",
    "it is often assumed that the initial slowing down of the dynamics of supercooled liquids can be rationalized by mct @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations are now able to investigate the first five decades in time of this slowing down @xcite , so this is also the regime which has been studied in greatest microscopic detail .",
    "the degree of success of mct is still a matter of debate .",
    "this is due to the fact that the central mct prediction , a complete dynamical arrest at a temperature @xmath0 where the alpha - relaxation time diverges as a power law , @xmath1 , is actually never observed , but a power law fit to the data apparently works on a restricted time window @xcite .",
    "the appearance of new mechanisms for relaxation , often termed `` activated processes '' , but seldom described in any detail , is then invoked to explain the discrepancy between observations and mct predictions .",
    "in fact , activated processes are actually quantitatively defined , within mct , by deviations between data and predictions  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that activated processes become relevant close to the dynamical singularity @xmath0 , their main effect being to prevent the predicted transition .    from @xmath0 downwards",
    "it is assumed that the physics is dominated by activated processes , which determine also the canonical features of glass transition phenomena @xcite : non - exponential relaxation , strong and fragile liquid behaviours , decoupling between transport coefficients , etc .",
    "it is sometimes said that the relevant physics for the glass transition sets in at @xmath0 , and is therefore out of reach of numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "crossovers into the activated dynamics regime are also reported to occur at temperatures @xmath2 @xcite or @xmath3 @xcite , depending on which aspect of the physics is considered .",
    "it is believed that all these temperatures are close enough to be taken as equivalent , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the above scenario is apparently corroborated by the study of the statistical properties of the potential energy landscape of model liquids @xcite . from the properties of the landscape",
    "two temperatures seem to emerge , @xmath5 and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the onset of slowing down of the dynamics takes place at @xmath5 , and coincides with the temperature below which the average energy of inherent structures ( is ) , i.e. , local minima of the potential energy @xcite , @xmath6 , starts to decrease markedly , see fig .",
    "[ crossoverlj ] .",
    "this has been interpreted as the sign that the landscape starts to `` influence '' the dynamical behaviour @xcite . at @xmath0 , it is further argued , a second change in the landscape properties takes place , which is indicated by several observations  @xcite .",
    "for example , the mean - square displacement from an equilibrated configuration to its corresponding inherent structure , @xmath7 , is proportional to @xmath8 below @xmath0 , as expected from pure vibrations in quadratic wells , but the temperature dependence changes above @xmath0 , revealing `` anharmonicities '' in the landscape @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ crossoverlj ] .",
    "another indication of a topological change in the energy landscape was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in analogy with what happens in mean field models @xcite : the vanishing as @xmath8 approaches @xmath0 of the mean intensive number of negative directions ( intensive index ) of stationary points of the potential energy , @xmath9 .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite found that @xmath9 decreases with decreasing @xmath8 , and fits were performed to show that @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation of this result is the apparent existence at @xmath0 of a `` geometric transition '' between a `` saddle dominated regime '' above @xmath0 and a `` minima dominated regime '' below @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 would then really coincide with the appearance of activated processes , described in a topographic language as `` hopping '' between minima of the landscape .",
    "analogous findings had been previously reported from instantaneous normal mode analysis of equilibrium configurations @xcite , also supporting a qualitative change in the landscape topology close to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "figure [ crossoverlj ] summarizes this mct / landscape scenario with published numerical data  @xcite obtained for the standard supercooled liquid model of ref .",
    "@xcite .      at first sight fig .",
    "[ crossoverlj ] appears as convincing evidence in favour of the mct / landscape interpretation of the dynamics . on closer inspection , however , the above scenario is less robust .",
    "several qualitative and quantitative observations do not fit into the picture presented above .    _",
    "( i ) activated dynamics above @xmath0 . _",
    "the main idea behind the landscape approach @xcite is that vibrations and structural relaxations take place on very different time scales , so that the system is `` trapped '' and vibrates in one minimum before `` hopping '' to another minimum .",
    "this is indeed observed using the mapping from trajectories to is @xcite in simulations of sufficiently small systems @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed theoretically this issue in a recent work @xcite . given that numerical studies were performed much above @xmath0 , a crucial conclusion of refs.@xcite",
    "is that `` activated dynamics '' is indeed present in this temperature regime .    _",
    "( ii ) heterogeneous dynamics above @xmath0 .",
    "_ it is now well - documented that the dynamics of supercooled liquids , even above the mode coupling temperature @xmath0 , is heterogeneous in the sense that the local relaxation time has non - trivial spatial correlations @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is not very different from what happens experimentally close to the glass transition @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "besides , the decoupling between transport coefficients , which is also interpreted in terms of dynamical heterogeneity @xcite , is observed in numerical simulations above @xmath0 @xcite , although the effect is quantitatively less pronounced than in experiments near @xmath11  @xcite .    _",
    "( iii ) presence of saddles below @xmath0 .",
    "_ despite claims based on numerical results that @xmath0 marks a real change in the topology of the landscape @xcite , there are strong indications that this is at best only a crossover @xcite , and at worst a biased interpretation of numerical data  @xcite .",
    "for instance , careful numerical studies have shown that the saddle index @xmath9 remains positive even below @xmath0 @xcite",
    ". moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite argues convincingly that the data for @xmath9 can be described by an arrhenius law , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 an energy scale , which means that @xmath0 does not mark any particular change in the saddle index .",
    "the problems described above can be overcome through an alternative perspective on glass transition phenomena which puts the real space aspects of the dynamics at its core .",
    "this is the approach developed in refs.@xcite . interestingly ,",
    "several of its central concepts , like the relevance to the dynamics of localized excitations @xcite and the importance of effective kinetic constraints @xcite , have been present in the literature for many years .",
    "moreover , one of the original key observations of dynamic heterogeneity in glass formers was made by harrowell and coworkers @xcite in the models of ref.@xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for an exhaustive review .",
    "our approach relies on only two basic observations .",
    "( i ) at low temperature mobility within a supercooled liquid is sparse and very few particles are mobile .",
    "this is somewhat equivalent to the statement that particles are `` caged '' for long period of times , as reflected by a plateau in the mean - square displacement of individual particles .",
    "( ii ) when a microscopic region of space is mobile it influences the dynamics of neighbouring regions , enabling them to become mobile , and thus allowing mobility to propagate in the system .",
    "this is the concept of dynamic facilitation @xcite .",
    "the observation that very mobile particles in a supercooled liquid move along correlated `` strings '' @xcite is a confirmation of this fundamental idea .    from these two concepts it is possible to build effective microscopic models for glass formers by means of a coarse - graining procedure .",
    "this procedure can be schematically described as follows @xcite .",
    "spatially , the particles are coarse - grained over a length scale @xmath14 of the order of the static correlation length given by the pair correlation function .",
    "this removes any static correlations between coarse grained regions of linear size @xmath14 .",
    "cells are then identified according to their mobility by performing a coarse - graining on a microscopic time scale @xmath15 . in its simplest version cells",
    "are identified by a scalar `` mobility field '' , @xmath16 , the values @xmath17 corresponding to an immobile / mobile cell at position @xmath18 and time @xmath19 .",
    "the next step is to replace continuous space by a lattice , @xmath20 .",
    "mobile or excited cells carry a free energy cost , so when mobility is low it is reasonable to describe their static properties with a non - interacting hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath21 for a lattice of @xmath22 sites .",
    "the link between mobility and potential energy @xcite has also been observed in numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "the coarse - graining procedure described above will generate local dynamical rules for the mobility field .",
    "the prominent feature of this dynamics will be dynamic facilitation , which in its simplest version states that a cell at site @xmath23 is allowed to move only if it has an excited nearest neighbour @xcite , @xmath24 { } \\\\ \\end{array } n_i=1 , \\label{rates}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 indicates nearest neighbour , and @xmath27 represents the average concentration of excited cells easily deduced from ( [ ham ] ) : @xmath28 explicit examples where dynamic facilitation is generated under coarse - graining can be found in ref .",
    "clearly , different models are defined simply by changing the kinetic rules , e.g. , the number or directionality of mobile neighbours required to move @xcite .",
    "also , a more complex mobility field may be required to account quantitatively for all glass transition features @xcite .",
    "crucially , we will show that the physical mechanisms which explain the onset of slowing down and crossovers between different dynamical regimes in supercooled liquids are generic to this class of models .",
    "this means that we can use the simplest of them , the fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ ham],[rates ] ) in one spatial dimension ( hereafter 1d fa model ) to make detailed predictions and calculations .",
    "in order to understand the physics captured by the coarse - grained facilitated models defined above , it is useful to look at trajectories , that is , space - time representations of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ traj ] three representative trajectories for the 1d fa model , where mobile cells ( defects ) are black , and immobile ones are white . from the trajectories ,",
    "the principal observation is the appearance at low temperatures of non - trivial spatio - temporal correlations , seen as spatially and temporally extended domains of immobile cells delimited by isolated defects @xcite . in 1d they look like `` bubbles ''  @xcite , and trajectories are dense assemblies of these slow bubbles .",
    "this nanoscopic ordering in trajectory space is the cause of the phenomenon of dynamic heterogeneity observed experimentally and in simulations  @xcite .",
    "dynamic heterogeneity is the central aspect of the physics of supercooled liquids : it is naturally captured by our approach .",
    "the statistical mechanics of trajectories , rather than configurations , determines the dynamical behaviour .",
    "for example , due to the non - interacting hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , static correlations are trivial . however",
    ", when trajectories are considered , it is clear that cells become dynamically correlated . in other words",
    ", these models naturally predict the existence of a dynamical correlation @xmath29 which grows when the dynamics slows down .",
    "this statement can be quantified @xcite by studying multi - point functions , for example , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a dynamical correlator at site @xmath23 ( below we will consider the persistence of site @xmath23 ) .",
    "the spatial decay of a function like @xmath32 defines unambiguously the dynamical correlation length @xmath29 , as already discussed theoretically @xcite and measured in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the joint distributions of time and length scales give rise to the canonical features of glass formers , like stretched relaxation , decoupling between transport coefficients , and ( kinetic and thermodynamic ) strong and fragile behaviours  @xcite .",
    "let us take a closer look at the temperature evolution of the trajectories in fig .",
    "[ traj ] . starting from the very low temperatures where trajectories consist of a mixture of slow bubbles ,",
    "the dynamics can be understood in terms of the opening and closing of bubbles , that is , the branching of an excitation line or the coalescence of two . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "these events are the `` hopping between minima '' described in ref .",
    "therefore , we have a clear understanding of `` activated processes '' and of their statistical properties  @xcite .    as temperature",
    "is increased more and more defects are present .",
    "this has several consequences .",
    "first , the typical spatial and temporal extension of bubbles reduces , that is , the system becomes faster and less heterogeneous .",
    "second , clusters of defects become more common . these objects are important because their dynamics is completely different from that of isolated defects . in a cluster , defects do not have to diffuse and create or annihilate other defects but can instantaneously relax in a much faster process . at high temperature ,",
    "the dynamics is fast because almost no bubbles are present , and the dynamics is governed by clusters of defects .",
    "interestingly , at some intermediate temperature ( middle frame in fig .",
    "[ traj ] ) a coexistence between clusters and isolated defects is observed , so that the dynamics has a `` mixed '' character .",
    "clusters of defects disappear much faster with decreasing temperature than the overall concentration of defects .",
    "the probability to have a cluster of @xmath33 defects is indeed @xmath34 , so that at low @xmath8 we have @xmath35 .",
    "the coexistence of fast and slow processes with different temperature behaviour has a direct influence on the distribution of local relaxation times , which we present in fig .",
    "[ distrib ] for various temperatures . at high temperature , @xmath36 , where fast processes are dominant , the distribution is exponential , with a mean which depends weakly on temperature ( below we discuss in detail its temperature dependence ) . around @xmath37 ,",
    "a shoulder develops in the large time tail of the distribution , corresponding to the appearance of the bubbles in the trajectories of fig .",
    "this marks the increasing relevance of slow processes and the growth of the dynamic correlation length beyond the microscopic high temperature value .",
    "this temperature corresponds therefore to the onset temperature , @xmath38 .",
    "decreasing further the temperature , we clearly see a regime of mixed dynamics . at @xmath39 ,",
    "for instance , there are two peaks in the distribution , reflecting the coexistence of clusters and isolated defects . at this temperature ,",
    "the time scale has already increased by several orders of magnitude , and the dynamic correlation length is about @xmath40 .",
    "finally , further decrease in temperature makes clusters of defects very rare and we are left only with the contribution of isolated defects .",
    "this low temperature distribution is the one discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which in turn implies the stretched exponential decay of dynamical correlators .",
    "the contribution of clusters becomes negligible beyond a second crossover temperature , here @xmath41 .",
    "while this crossover temperature is not linked in any way to the mode coupling singularity @xmath0 , this choice of notation will become clear shortly .    from these distributions",
    ", it is possible to propose an empirical but quantitative determination of @xmath5 and @xmath0 . at each temperature @xmath8",
    ", the distribution is composed of fast processes , @xmath42 , and slow processes , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 can be defined , e.g. , as in ref .",
    "@xcite . requiring that slow processes are",
    "a significant fraction ( say 90% ) of the distribution leads to the definition of @xmath0 : @xmath45 where in an abuse of notation we also call @xmath46 the distribution of persistence times . requiring that slow processes , while not dominant in number ,",
    "still contribute to a significant fraction of the mean relaxation time ( say again 90% ) leads to the definition of @xmath5 : @xmath47    in fig .",
    "[ regime ] , we summarize the physical picture that emerges from the considerations of this section . from the distributions of fig .",
    "[ distrib ] , we recognize that the dynamics becomes slow when the temperature is decreased below the onset temperature @xmath5 .",
    "this distinguishes the trivial liquid and the slow glassy regimes . from the trajectories of fig .",
    "[ traj ] , we were also able to distinguish between fast , non - activated processes ( clusters ) , and slow , activated processes ( isolated defects , bubbles ) .",
    "the former , typical of the liquid high-@xmath8 physics , become negligible below @xmath0 , while the latter , typical of the low-@xmath8 physics , appear at the onset temperature @xmath5 . as a consequence ,",
    "the crossover region @xmath48 contains traces of both high-@xmath8 and low-@xmath8 physics , as observed in the time distributions of fig .",
    "[ distrib ] .",
    "the physical picture we have presented for the onset of slowing down , based on the increasing relevance of a dynamically heterogeneous evolution of the system , leads to quantitative predictions which are in good agreement with previous numerical and experimental studies , as we discuss in this section .",
    "the basic dynamical quantities recorded in experiments and simulations of supercooled liquids are spatially averaged two - time functions .",
    "simulations usually focus on the time domain and typically consider density - density correlation functions , while experimental results are often expressed in the frequency domain , measuring for instance dielectric susceptibilities .",
    "we will only consider systems in equilibrium so that the information content of both kinds of measurements is equivalent .    from the distributions of times , fig .",
    "[ distrib ] , it is easy to derive dynamical correlators for the 1d fa model considered here .",
    "the spatially averaged persistence function reads , @xmath49 the behaviour of @xmath50 as a function of time for various temperatures is shown in fig .",
    "[ persistence ] . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the persistence function is known exactly due to the diffusion properties of isolated defects , and one gets @xmath51 , \\label{stretched}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the relaxation time discussed in the next section . for the 1d fa model , @xmath53 , but the stretching exponent might be temperature dependent in more elaborated ( fragile ) models  @xcite , as is indeed observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "we see from fig .  [ persistence ] that for @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath50 is well approximated by eq .",
    "( [ stretched ] ) on the whole time window . for higher temperatures , @xmath56 ,",
    "the mixed character of the correlators is evident from the fact that eq .",
    "( [ stretched ] ) only describes the long time behaviour of the correlator , as expected . in this temperature regime , short times are best described by a simple exponential . in the high temperature regime , @xmath57 ,",
    "relaxation is just exponential for all times .",
    "we conclude that the appearance of isolated defects at @xmath5 is reflected in the long time behaviour of dynamical correlators . in the crossover region , @xmath58 ,",
    "more and more of the decorrelation is due to isolated defects when @xmath8 decreases .",
    "below @xmath0 the entire decorrelation is due to these slow processes .",
    "a confirmation of the progressive domination of slow over fast processes described above can be found in the numerical results of ref .",
    "the similarity of fig .  4 of ref.@xcite and our fig .  [ persistence ]",
    "is in fact quite striking .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite calculated density - density correlations from both real configurations and their corresponding is in a binary lennard - jones mixture .",
    "the latter , where thermal energies were removed in the quenching procedure , are the ones which have to be compared with fig .",
    "[ persistence ] , since fast vibrations are also removed in our coarse - grained approach .",
    "an important conclusion is that the long - time decay of dynamical correlators , sometimes referred to as the alpha - relaxation , is due to the presence of isolated defects and therefore of heterogeneous dynamics , even in the @xmath59 regime .",
    "this means that activated dynamics , in the language of mct , or hopping events in topographic terms , are responsible for the alpha - relaxation , even at temperatures well above @xmath0 . this conclusion is unavoidable in view of the numerical data of refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "the next natural quantity to consider , the relaxation time @xmath52 , is readily obtained from the dynamical correlators discussed in the previous subsection . from the discussion of section  [ physics ] , we expect a crossover from high-@xmath8 to low-@xmath8 at the onset temperature @xmath5 , see eq .",
    "( [ to ] ) .",
    "our results for the 1d fa model are presented in fig .",
    "[ talpha ] , where @xmath52 is defined as the time where the persistence function has decayed to the value @xmath60 .",
    "the simplest mean - field approximation to the dynamics of the fa model consists in a hartree like decoupling of spatial correlations , @xmath61 , in the dynamical equation for @xmath62 . this amounts to replacing the actual neighbourhood of site @xmath23 by an average neighbourhood , and spins are always facilitated with an average rate equal to @xmath27 .",
    "this gives a mean - field estimate of the relaxation time @xcite , @xmath63 fig .",
    "[ talpha ] shows that this simple approximation accounts for the dependence of the relaxation time at high temperatures , @xmath64 .",
    "the exact result for the relaxation time of the 1d fa model is obtained by realizing that isolated defects undergo diffusion with a temperature dependent diffusion constant , @xmath65 .",
    "the system relaxes when defects have diffused over a distance given by the mean separation between defects , @xmath66 , so that @xmath67 this mechanism relies on the notion of dynamic facilitation which implies that local fluctuations of the mobility determine the dynamics , and is essentially beyond reach of any mean - field type of approximation @xcite .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ talpha ] that eq .",
    "( [ tex ] ) accounts for the behaviour at low temperatures , @xmath68 .",
    "figure [ talpha ] also presents a fit to the data with an mct power law form for the relaxation time @xcite , @xmath69 similar to the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the 2-spin facilitated , two dimensional version of the fa model .    from fig .",
    "[ talpha ] , we draw the following conclusions .",
    "the behaviour of the relaxation time changes from the high-@xmath8 to low-@xmath8 behaviour close to the onset temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the combination of simple mean - field at high-@xmath8 with the exact form at low-@xmath8 allows to describe the temperature dependence of the relaxation time over the whole temperature range .",
    "however , given that @xmath52 smoothly interpolates between these two different functional forms , the mct power law form , eq .",
    "( [ tmct ] ) , appears to works reasonably well in a time window of about three decades ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ talpha ] ) .",
    "this range of apparent power - law behaviour is in fact larger than the corresponding one in the canonical binary lennard - jones mixture of ref .",
    "@xcite , where extensive tests of mct have been performed .",
    "remarkably , we also find that the @xmath0 extracted from the power law fit to the relaxation time coincides well with the temperature where fast processes cease to contribute in a significant manner to the distribution of relaxation times , fig .",
    "[ distrib ] .",
    "this explains our choice of notation for the lower crossover temperature , @xmath0 .    following the standard mct reading of the data  @xcite",
    ", we would erroneously conclude that activated processes only appear close to @xmath70 , since these processes are often tautologically defined by the breakdown of the power law behaviour of the relaxation time @xcite .",
    "[ distrib ] , [ persistence ] , and [ talpha ] , prove instead that activated dynamics starts to be relevant at @xmath5 , much above @xmath0 , dominating the alpha - relaxation of the correlators , and hence the relaxation time of the system .",
    "the results of this section considerably weaken the possibility of the existence of a temperature regime in supercooled liquids where the relaxation time is correctly described by a power law behaviour .",
    "it follows that the standard determination of the location of the mct `` singularity '' @xmath0 in experiments and simulations is physically unjustified  @xcite . in fact , the issue of the location of @xmath0 has been recently addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that for a variety of systems , the temperature @xmath0 obtained from the actual mct equations systematically coincides with the onset temperature @xmath5 discussed above .",
    "let us now consider the quantities shown in fig .",
    "[ crossoverlj ] as evidence in favour of the mct / landscape picture in lennard - jones mixtures , from the perspective of dynamically facilitated models . in fig .",
    "[ crossoverfa ] we show for the 1d fa model a plot analogous to fig .",
    "[ crossoverlj ] .    the first quantity presented in fig .",
    "[ crossoverfa ] is the logarithm of the relaxation time , @xmath71 , as a function of temperature , which we discussed in detail in the previous subsection .",
    "the second quantity shown in fig .",
    "[ crossoverfa ] is the average energy of inherent structures , @xmath72 . for the 1d fa model",
    "it can be computed analytically by solving the zero - temperature dynamics of the model @xcite , @xmath73 where the concentration of defects , @xmath27 , is defined in eq .",
    "( [ ct ] ) . at high temperature @xmath72 changes",
    "very slowly .",
    "when @xmath8 is reduced below @xmath5 the concentration of defects starts to decrease markedly , and @xmath72 follows the same trend , as can be seen in fig .  [ crossoverfa ] .",
    "this change in behaviour at the onset temperature @xmath5 is due to the appearance of isolated defects , and therefore of a heterogeneous dynamics , and not to any special change of the potential energy surface .",
    "this is a very different interpretation of the physics from that of ref.@xcite .",
    "the third quantity shown in fig .",
    "[ crossoverfa ] is analogous to the distance between a configuration and its nearest is ( see fig.[crossoverlj ] ) . in the lattice models we are considering the natural quantity to compute",
    "is the concentration of sites which change during the descent towards the inherent structure , @xmath74 . since only excited sites can change during this procedure , we get , @xmath75 clearly , at low temperature @xmath76 .",
    "this behaviour is physically natural .",
    "contributions to @xmath74 come from clusters of defects , which are the only objects that can relax during the descent to an is .",
    "since the probability for a cluster of @xmath33 defects , @xmath77 , goes as @xmath78 , the main non trivial contribution to @xmath74 at low @xmath8 comes from the smallest clusters , @xmath79 .",
    "these relax only one defect in the descent , so that @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , our defect interpretation is consistent with real space observations in simulations of silica @xcite , where it was found that during the descent to the is the major contributions to the distance comes from annihilation of localized topological defects of the amorphous structure .",
    "the similarity of fig .",
    "[ crossoverfa ] to fig .",
    "[ crossoverlj ] is striking .",
    "the emerging physical picture is however completely different from the one of the mct / landscape scenario .",
    "for example , while it may appear from the behaviour of @xmath81 above @xmath0 that this quantity extrapolates to zero when @xmath82 ( see fig.[crossoverfa ] ) , the exact temperature dependence of @xmath74 is purely arrhenius .",
    "this means that @xmath0 has no particular importance [ @xmath0 would not look special in a plot of @xmath74 versus @xmath83 . even if one accepts @xmath0 as delimiting two regimes with high and low concentrations of clusters of excitations , this apparent",
    "crossover is completely irrelevant as far as the long - time dynamics is concerned .",
    "these observations suggest that the crossover at @xmath0 from `` landscape - influenced '' to `` landscape - dominated '' of ref .",
    "@xcite is not physically significant for the alpha - relaxation .",
    "in recent years , the potential energy landscape of supercooled liquids has become an object of study _ per se _  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have developed the idea that the main motivation behind these works was the observation of the separation between fast vibrations and slow hopping processes if sufficiently small systems are considered .",
    "this apparently harmless statement on the system size , we argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , results in fact from the central feature of the dynamics of supercooled liquids : `` sufficiently small '' really means `` if the system size is of the order of the dynamical correlation length @xmath29 ''  @xcite .",
    "however , in a purely topographic description of the physics based on the statistical properties of minima , the relevance of the dynamical correlation length is not obvious  @xcite . in that sense , a topographic description of the glass transition misses a central aspect of the physics .",
    "we shall show below that using the very simple spatial approach described in previous sections , we can trivially derive the statistical properties of the landscape reported in recent years .",
    "this successful confrontation to such an amount of apparently non - trivial and detailed numerical results is again a strong indication of the validity of our approach .",
    "reference  @xcite described in detail the connection between the nanoscopic ordering in the trajectories of dynamically facilitated models and the dynamics between is , `` metabasins '' , or `` traps '' observed in numerical simulations or experiments of supercooled liquids .",
    "this same approach can be extended to account for the properties of `` saddles '' , i.e. , configurations related to transitions between is .",
    "figure  [ saddle ] zooms on the lowest temperature trajectory of fig .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ saddle ] shows diffusion of isolated defects .",
    "it also shows coalescence and branching events , i.e. , closing and opening of bubbles .",
    "these two kinds of processes correspond to `` hopping '' events between dynamical `` traps '' @xcite .",
    "lets consider in detail one of these events , for example the coalescence process enlarged in the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ saddle ] .",
    "isolated defects diffuse by first facilitating one of their neighbours , for instance , @xmath84 for two defects to coalesce the minimum number of excitations that have to be present when they merge is three : @xmath85 in this sequence , the total number of defects is 2 at the beginning , 3 at the transition , and 1 at the end .",
    "this process is schematically described in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ saddle ] .    in topographic terms , an isolated defect corresponds to a local minimum of the energy , since such a configuration can only evolve by an energy increase , as in ( [ diff ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", a cluster of three excitations corresponds locally to a saddle point , since it is the transition configuration between two minima , as in ( [ trans ] ) and fig .",
    "[ saddle ] .",
    "larger clusters thus correspond to higher order saddles , since the larger the cluster the larger the number of possible moves into minima .",
    "the case @xmath79 is particular : it is not a minimum since it can relax one defect to decrease its energy , but it is not a saddle either since it does not correspond to a hopping event like that of fig .",
    "[ saddle ] .",
    "clusters with @xmath79 are just ordinary points ( i.e. , not stationary points ) of the landscape .",
    "the previous discussion generalizes in a natural way to the whole class of dynamic facilitated systems .",
    "the above identification between the relevant dynamical objects , isolated defects and clusters of defects , and `` landscape properties '' allows one to compute quantities such as the mean saddle index , @xmath9 , and the corresponding mean energy of stationary points , @xmath86 .",
    "the quantities @xmath87 and @xmath88 were estimated numerically in simulations of supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "it was found that both functions decrease when @xmath8 decreases , and extrapolations were performed that indicated @xmath10 . also , plotting the dependence of @xmath87 on @xmath89 parameterized by the temperature , a simple linear relation was obtained , @xmath90  @xcite .    in the case of the 1d fa model , it is very simple to devise a procedure to go from an equilibrium configuration to the `` nearest '' stationary point .",
    "isolated defects and clusters of defects with @xmath91 are locally such points , so we only have to deal with @xmath79 clusters . from these we can either reach a `` minimum '' @xmath92 or a saddle with @xmath93 .",
    "we respectively assign the probabilities @xmath94 and @xmath95 to these two possibilities .",
    "we then have , @xmath96 and @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the probability to have a cluster of size @xmath33 . from the discussion above we know that @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 . putting all together we obtain , @xmath104 , \\label{index}\\ ] ] and @xmath105 at low @xmath8 both quantities scale as @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "three important conclusions can be drawn :    \\(i ) it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ index ] ) that @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "this means that there is no `` geometric transition '' to a regime with vanishing saddle index .",
    "\\(ii ) the saddle index has a temperature dependence which follows closely that of the distance @xmath74 discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "this is expected because they both receive their principal contribution , at low @xmath8 , from clusters with @xmath79 . in other words , the main objects for",
    "the low temperature dynamics , the isolated defects , do not contribute to these quantities .",
    "therefore , as for the distance @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ crossoverfa ] , the rapid decrease of @xmath9 when the temperature decreases can easily be confused with a vanishing of the saddle index close to @xmath0 .",
    "\\(iii ) the linear relation between @xmath87 and @xmath89 becomes exact at low temperatures , see eqs.([eis],[index],[ens ] ) .",
    "again , the difference between @xmath88 and @xmath72 comes from the clusters of defects which are relaxed during the descent to the inherent structure . in fig.[geometric2 ] , we show the behaviour of @xmath87 versus @xmath89 for the entire range @xmath110 .",
    "note that in ref.@xcite a linear behaviour between @xmath87 and @xmath88 was also reported .",
    "this is true at relatively high temperature , given that above @xmath5 the energy of inherent structure is almost constant while @xmath87 and @xmath88 change with temperature in the same way .",
    "these results are valid beyond the fa model which we have used to illustrate them . the inexistence of the geometric transition where the saddle index vanishes follows from the observation that the low temperature behaviour of @xmath87 is given by the smallest cluster of defects necessary to make a transition , in the sense described in the previous section . since these objects are spatially localized , their energy cost is @xmath111 , and they exist with non zero probability at finite temperature , @xmath109 .",
    "this argument is close in spirit to stillinger s argument for the inexistence of an entropy crisis at the kauzmann temperature involving point defects @xcite .",
    "moreover , as discussed in the introduction , careful numerical simulations both confirm that @xmath112 @xcite , and report an arrhenius behaviour @xmath9 @xcite , in agreement with our results .",
    "the relation between saddle index and energy , @xmath113 which was first observed numerically @xcite , is also a general result for dynamically facilitated systems .",
    "this relation contains two different pieces of information .",
    "first , it shows that the intensive saddle index is a number of @xmath111 .",
    "this is again a trivial consequence of the existence of the dynamical correlation length @xmath29 , so that a large sample can in fact be thought of an assembly of independent subsystems of linear size @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "second , and more interesting , is a connection between energy and saddle index , presented as a `` general feature of the potential energy landscape of supercooled liquids '' @xcite , for which no theoretical explanation was however available .",
    "this feature is in fact almost a tautology in the context of facilitated models : the more defects are present , the more available directions to move , the higher the energy above that of the is .",
    "the fact that relation ( [ lin ] ) holds in different model liquids is another confirmation that dynamical facilitation is a key generic feature of the dynamics of supercooled liquids .",
    "another common procedure of the landscape approach is to decompose configurations into vibrational and configurational components .",
    "stillinger and weber  @xcite suggested to perform this decomposition at the level of the partition function , @xmath114 where the sum is over energies of is , @xmath115 , their number is indicated by @xmath116 , and @xmath117 is the `` basin free energy '' which takes into account fluctuations within an is due to vibrations and possible `` anharmonicities '' ( i.e. , all the rest ) .",
    "it is instructive to consider the calculation of the partition function in the case of the 1d fa model using the stillinger and weber decomposition .",
    "the thermodynamics of the fa model is that of a non - interacting gas of binary excitations .",
    "this simple thermodynamics , however , can be obtained with any dynamics obeying detailed balance with respect to the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) , the actual fa dynamics defined by ( [ rates ] ) being just one possibility . in this sense , the stillinger and weber prescription for thermodynamics is an approximation for the way a thermodynamic quantity would be calculated using a particular choice of dynamics to sample the configuration space .",
    "inherent structures , basin free energies , etc .",
    ", have no thermodynamic meaning , they only have a dynamical meaning associated with a particular choice of dynamics .    for the 1d fa model we can evaluate the stillinger and weber partition function exactly .",
    "we have : @xmath118 \\right ) } .",
    "\\label{zn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first factor counts the number of configurations of energy @xmath115 with only isolated defects in a system of @xmath22 sites . due to the coarse - grained nature of facilitated models the only contribution to the basin free energy comes from anharmonicities .",
    "performing the sum in eq .",
    "( [ zn ] ) without the anharmonic contribution gives , @xmath119 , \\ ] ] where @xmath120 is the @xmath22-th chebyshev polynomial of second kind . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the above expression simplifies to give the free energy in the `` harmonic '' approximation , @xmath121    in fig .",
    "[ figsw ] , we compare the approximation ( [ fharm ] ) to the exact expression for the free energy , @xmath122 as observed numerically in supercooled liquids @xcite , both thermodynamic evaluations , eqs .",
    "( [ fharm ] ) and ( [ fex ] ) , apparently coincide below @xmath0 when anharmonicities become negligible . from the previous sections we know that anharmonicities are just a consequence of the existence of clusters of defects . at low temperature",
    "the difference between ( [ fharm ] ) and ( [ fex ] ) is therefore proportional to @xmath123 , reflecting the fact that : ( i ) anharmonicities do not disappear below @xmath0 , which again is no particular temperature in this context ; ( ii ) anharmonicities are due to clusters of defects , @xmath79 being the leading term at low temperatures .    in the particular case of the fa model we can formulate an exact expression for the anharmonic free energy @xmath124 .",
    "it is easy to check that the choice @xmath125 in eq .",
    "( [ zn ] ) yields the exact expression for the free energy in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this exact expression for the anharmonic part of the free energy is simple to understand . in an",
    "is all defects are isolated .",
    "the contribution of clusters of defects is obtained from the probability that an isolated defect in the is was a cluster in the original configuration , which is given by eq.([fanh ] ) .",
    "interestingly , a numerical procedure to evaluate the anharmonic contributions can be proposed .",
    "first , the harmonic expression ( [ fharm ] ) is evaluated .",
    "then , the approximate expression @xmath126 can be used as an educated guess for the anharmonic contributions .",
    "this gives in turn a first order free energy , @xmath127 .",
    "the improvement on the harmonic evaluation can be judged in fig .",
    "[ figsw ] , where we see that @xmath127 coincides with the exact free energy up to @xmath128 .",
    "this evaluation can then be improved iteratively using @xmath129 to get @xmath130 , and so on .",
    "it is easy to show that , in our particular case , @xmath131 .",
    "although these results could lead to an improvement on present evaluations of anharmonic contributions in studies of the thermodynamics of supercooled liquids , they also show that topographic concepts are very far from the physical objects they pretend to describe .",
    "we end this section with a remark on the adam - gibbs relation , which is an attempt to connect dynamical properties to thermodynamic ones .",
    "the adam - gibbs formula relates the relaxation time of a glass former , @xmath132 , to the configurational entropy , @xmath133 [ which would correspond to @xmath134 in the is formalism ] : @xmath135 $ ] .",
    "apparently , this relation has been seen to hold both in numerical simulations and in experiments of various systems @xcite",
    ". a careful look at the published data reveals however that the correlation between relaxation time and entropy does not quantitatively satisfy the adams - gibbs relation . this important observation",
    "is often not clearly stated  @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows indeed that thermodynamic properties do not fully determine dynamical behaviours .",
    "clearly , almost by definition , @xmath132 increases and @xmath133 decreases as temperature is lowered , but that is where the connection ends .",
    "it is easy to check that the adam - gibbs formula fails completely when applied to dynamic facilitated systems .",
    "we find instead that time scales are broadly distributed , the distribution of times being the result of an integral over a distribution of length scales scale , @xmath136 , imposed by thermodynamic equilibrium , eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) . crucially however , dynamics also enters the integral in the form of the conditional probability of time and length , @xmath137 , which can be described , in a topographic language as containing informations on the relevant `` barriers '' , which have a priori no obvious link with the statistics of minima . as a consequence",
    ", thermodynamics alone can not be used to predict the dynamical behaviour .",
    "again , we find in the literature an excellent numerical confirmation of this statement .",
    "in refs  @xcite , using a purely topographic description of a supercooled liquid , it was shown that the diffusion constant could be computed by a combination of thermodynamic _ and _ dynamical quantities , well in line with the above discussion .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a spatial description of the physics of the progressive slowing down of supercooled liquids .",
    "the only ingredients in our method have been the notions of localized mobility excitations and facilitated dynamics @xcite .",
    "our results were illustrated explicitly for the simplest case of the 1d fa model , but are generic for this theoretical approach , and are in very good agreement with experimental and numerical observations in supercooled liquids .      at high temperatures , @xmath138 , the dynamics is fast and liquid - like , corresponding to the relaxation of large clusters of defects .",
    "dynamic facilitation plays no major role , and a simple mean - field hartree - like decoupling of the equations of motion yields predictions in good agreement with numerical results .    when @xmath139 , the dynamics becomes heterogeneous , in the sense that local relaxation times are spatially correlated in a non trivial way .",
    "this can be seen in the trajectories of fig .",
    "[ traj ] as the appearance of slow bubbles  @xcite .",
    "the long - time dynamics of the system results from the wide joint distribution of length scales and time scales , and the relaxation becomes stretched .",
    "this dynamic heterogeneity , which can be thought of as the activated dynamics invoked , but never described , by mct , determines the alpha - relaxation and its temperature dependence for @xmath140 .",
    "also , dynamic heterogeneity implies that decoupling of transport coefficients actually starts at @xmath5 , as confirmed by the simulations . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", local fluctuations of mobility crucially influence the dynamical behaviour .",
    "any mean - field like approach , no matter how involved , is most probably doomed to fail .    at @xmath5",
    "not all trace of high-@xmath8 physics ( clusters of defects ) disappears .",
    "the dynamics has a mixed character in the range @xmath141 , as seen for example in the behaviour of dynamical correlators like in fig",
    ".  [ persistence ] .",
    "the temperature @xmath0 is just a crossover .",
    "it is the temperature below which isolated defects not only dominate the long time dynamics ( as for @xmath48 ) but are also the most numerous dynamical objects , see eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) .",
    "clusters of defects , whose dynamics is homogeneous and non - activated , are responsible for the temperature dependence of several quantities , such as distance between configurations and is , saddle index @xmath9 , and anharmonic contributions to the free energy . in numerical simulations , @xmath0 has been interpreted as a key temperature , in accordance with mct for which it represents a dynamical singularity .",
    "we have shown , however , that all of these quantities have a smooth temperature dependence , as has been recently observed numerically @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath0 does not correspond to a transition or singular point , but is at most a crossover .",
    "crucially , the objects which display a crossover close to @xmath0 are also irrelevant for the long - time dynamics , so that the inexistence of the singularity @xmath0 is anyway not a physically important issue for the alpha - relaxation .",
    "below @xmath0 , isolated defects are the only remaining objects and the dynamics is dominated by the nanoscopic demixing of slow and fast regions so that trajectories look like a dense mixture of slow bubbles , which in turn gives a natural theoretical interpretation of the canonical features of glass transition phenomena  @xcite .      *",
    "the dynamics is heterogeneous and activated well above @xmath0 . *",
    "the dynamical slowing - down of supercooled liquids is due to the growth , below @xmath5 , of a dynamic correlation length @xmath29 , or more precisely , of a whole distribution of length and time scales . * the long - time dynamics , and therefore the relaxation time @xmath132 of the liquid",
    "is dominated by heterogeneous `` activated '' dynamics below @xmath5 . *",
    "the mct definition of activated processes as deviations from the ideal theory is incorrect .",
    "it is unlikely that the power law behaviour predicted by mct correctly describes the temperature dependence of @xmath132",
    ". the practical definition of the temperature @xmath0 can not be used . *",
    "no topological change of the potential energy landscape takes place close to @xmath0 .",
    "quantities such as the saddle index and anharmonicities do not vanish close to @xmath0 and have a smooth temperature behaviour . at best",
    ", they undergo a crossover from large to small which remains to be quantified . * even if one accepts @xmath0 as a crossover temperature , as in eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) , quantities related to this crossover are unimportant for the long - time dynamics .",
    "* knowledge of thermodynamic properties is not enough to predict dynamical behaviour , which explains the quantitative failure of relations like the adams - gibbs formula .",
    "the approach we developed in this paper , which is an extension of previous efforts @xcite , is generic .",
    "it can be applied both to systems like lennard - jones liquids or to hard sphere systems .",
    "it gives a perspective on the physics of glass formers which is clearly distinct to , and in many respects much more natural than , that of mct or topographic approaches .",
    "there are many important and interesting open questions which need to be addressed from this new perspective .",
    "this include , among others , understanding properly the origin of mobility excitations , and the breakdown of stokes - einstein - debye relations and associated decouplings between transport coefficients .",
    "a general conclusion that can be drawn from this work and our previous ones is that , in many respects , glass transition phenomena is more standard than often assumed , in the sense that it is determined by the interplay between growing dynamic lengthscales and timescales .",
