    "as cold atomic gas capabilities advance @xcite , a large number of interesting quantum systems can now be built using the cold atom toolbox @xcite .",
    "the structure and dynamics of one - dimensional quantum systems is a specific venue in which cold atoms have driven a new surge of excitement as a number of important models of many - body quantum physics can now be probed experimentally @xcite .",
    "this includes the famous strongly interacting bose systems studied by tonks @xcite and girardeau @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has become possible to push these studies to smaller particle numbers @xcite so that few - body physics in one - dimensional traps with controllable interactions can now be realized .",
    "a number of such studies in recent years using two - component fermi systems have probed such concepts as fermionization @xcite , pairing @xcite , polarons @xcite , and the hubbard @xcite and heisenberg models @xcite , all in the limit where the system contains just a few particles .",
    "these developments have sparked a lot of interest in the few - body community and a number of new theoretical studies looking at various aspects of these two - component fermi systems in one dimension have emerged @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the recent experiments that have shown how one may build a fermi system consisting of an impurity and a fermi sea one particle at a time @xcite .",
    "this amounts to building a so - called fermi polaron from a few - body perspective .",
    "the experimental results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that already for a system consisting of only six particles ( five identical fermions and a single impurity of the same mass as the other particles ) one can see the emergence of a many - body system taking place .",
    "this is a rather remarkable result and in the present paper we would like to explore this in more detail .",
    "the experimental results consists of a series of measurements of the energy for different interaction strengths and for different system sizes and have previously been compared to theoretical predictions in the literature @xcite . however , there are some ambiguities in this comparison arising from the fact that the experimental system is in a trap while a lot of theoretical work considers a homogeneous system",
    ". proposals for merging the homogeneous results with a trapped system are known and one of our goals here is to assess how well they work as a function of particle number and interaction strength .",
    "we will take advantage of the fact that we have access to both very accurate numerical calculations for all interaction strengths for up to eleven particles and in the strongly interacting regime for up to thirty particles in a harmonic trap . using these results",
    "we will shed some light on the questions concerning how many particles constitutes ` many ' in one - dimensional impurity systems and when such systems can be considered in the strongly interacting regime .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 spin-@xmath1 fermions with mass @xmath2 confined in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) harmonic trap with oscillator frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the fermions in the gas are spin - polarized with @xmath4 particles in , say , the spin - up state , while the remaining particle ( the impurity ) is in the spin - down state .",
    "the particles interact via a short - range interaction modelled by a delta function of coupling strength @xmath5 .",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath6    + g",
    "\\sum\\limits_{i < j } \\delta(x_i - x_j ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] in the interaction term , the sum runs over all pairs of particles , but due to the antisymmetry of the total wave function under exchange of any two majority particles , the majority particles do not couple to each other . thus the interaction term above is equivalent to only summing over the @xmath4 pairs consisting of the impurity and each of the majority particles .",
    "as has been recently demonstrated experimentally , the interaction strength may be varied from small to large positive and negative values @xcite .",
    "we will limit ourselves to a repulsive interaction , @xmath7 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use harmonic oscillator units where @xmath8 .",
    "we start by discussing the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) limit in which the interaction between the particles is infinitely strong , @xmath9 . in this limit",
    ", the ground state becomes @xmath10-fold degenerate with the energy @xmath11 , and the wave function vanish whenever any two particles meet .",
    "the superscript t denotes the fact that the system is trapped , and the subscript @xmath12 refers to the interaction being infinitely strong .",
    "notice that the degenerate energy in the ground state manifold is also the ground state energy of an ideal non - interacting fermi gas of @xmath0 particles in a harmonic trap , i.e. the particles occupy the @xmath0 lowest - lying energy states in the trap .",
    "the degeneracy is lifted by moving slightly away from @xmath13 , and the wave function is lifted slightly away from zero at the surfaces where the impurity meets a majority particle .",
    "this allows the impurity to switch position with its neighbors , and we can therefore think of the particles as occupying sites on a lattice . the system can be described by an effective heisenberg spin chain model as discussed in @xcite . to linear order in @xmath14 , we may cast the hamiltonian as @xmath15 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 are the pauli matrices acting on the spin of the particle at site @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a geometric coefficient determined by the trap potential .",
    "these are the same @xmath19-coefficients discussed in @xcite , where the case of a general confining potential , @xmath20 , and an arbitrary number of spin - up and spin - down particles is considered .",
    "the general case captures the behavior of both bosonic and fermionic particles near the tg limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the geometric coefficient @xmath18 generally can be expressed as : @xmath21    \\right]_{\\lambda = 0 } \\nonumber\\\\    & + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left [ \\frac{\\textrm{d}\\psi_i}{\\textrm{d}x }    \\right]^2_{x = b}\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to compute this we need access to the @xmath0 lowest - energy single - particle wavefunctions @xmath22 solving the schrdinger equation @xmath23\\psi_i = e_i \\psi_i$ ] . in the present case , this is the analytically solved schrdinger equation for a single particle in a harmonic oscillator . in eq .",
    "@xmath24 is a @xmath25 symmetric matrix with the @xmath26th entry given by @xmath27 , and @xmath28 defines a minor obtained by removing the @xmath29th column and the @xmath30th row . for most potentials such as smooth potentials like the present case",
    ", the integration limits will be @xmath31 , and for some non - analytic potentials such as a hard box , the integration will be confined to some finite region of space . for symmetric confining potentials , as the one studied in this paper , the coefficients are also symmetric , @xmath32 .",
    "the main motivation for the present work is that we are able to determine these geometric @xmath19-coefficients exactly in the general case of an arbitrary potential , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed presentation of our method including a derivation of eq .  .",
    "the method is implemented as a highly efficient numerical program released as open source software  . ] .",
    "we stress the importance of our capability to perform these calculations numerically exact ; we do not use monte carlo integration or any other approximate method . for this paper , we calculate the geometric coefficients numerically exact for a harmonic potential for @xmath33 .",
    "the coefficients are given in section  [ appa].calculating the coefficients for such a high number of particles as 30 is an extremely demanding computational task .",
    "however , the method we have developed enables us to perform these calculations on a small laptop to a very high level of precision in a matter of hours for 30 particles . for a few particles ,",
    "the calculations are done almost immediately .",
    "since the harmonic potential is such a well - studied confining potential , this allows us to compare our exact results with the approximate methods studied in the literature .",
    "in particular , we are interested in comparing methods for calculating the ground state energy in the vicinity of the tg limit . to linear order in @xmath34 , we write the ground state energy as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the eigenvalue of the sum in eq .   for the ground state , i.e. the largest eigenvalue .",
    "we denote @xmath36 the contact coefficient @xcite .",
    "access to the exact geometric coefficients @xmath37 allows us to diagonalize the hamiltonian in eq .   and calculate the contact coefficient exactly .",
    "for @xmath38 we compute @xmath36 and want to compare our results with previous approximate formulas for this constant .",
    "now we will review some previous calculations of the contact coefficient @xmath36 in eq .  .",
    "however , since the previous theories may not take the trap into account , we will have to adapt the existing formulas in order to directly compare them with our results . in the following",
    ", we will distinguish between the _ free _ system and the ( harmonically ) _ trapped _ system .",
    "furthermore , we will discuss different regimes of the interaction strength @xmath5 and the particle number @xmath0 .",
    "a pioneering piece of work was done by mcguire @xcite who calculated the ground state energy for a free 1d fermi gas with a single impurity for an arbitrary interaction strength @xmath5 subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus the trap needs to be taken into account .",
    "this problem was recently addressed by astrakharchik and brouzos who applied the local density approximation ( lda ) to mcguire s result in order to obtain an expression for a harmonically trapped system @xcite .",
    "however , mcguire assumes that the number of particles @xmath0 is even and large .",
    "this subtlety does not appear to be explicitly discussed in ref .",
    "namely , the implicit condition that @xmath0 is very large makes it interesting to compare the result with our exact results for small @xmath0 . to get the desired contact coefficient @xmath36 , we should expand astrakharchik and brouzos lda result around @xmath13 to first order and read off the coefficient .",
    "mcguire s energy expression was found for a free interacting system subject to periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "it would be interesting to consider a hard wall boundary condition ( hwc ) , too .",
    "this problem was solved by oelkers _",
    "_ for a free gas in the strong coupling regime @xcite which is exactly the regime we are interested in .",
    "in fact oelkers _ et al .",
    "_ found results for both pbc and hwc for finite ( even ) @xmath0 , and not just in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "just as astrakharchik and brouzos applied lda to mcguire s free result , we shall apply lda to oelkers free results .",
    "since the lda method maps the free system to a trapped system , we would intuitively think that hwc would produce a better final result , since a hard wall would resemble a harmonic potential more that a periodic boundary .",
    "this will turn out not to be the case , but as we shall also see , these lda results are subject to high uncertainties in the small @xmath0 regime .",
    "nevertheless this is an important regime as current experiments study the behaviour of few particles .",
    "the starting point for our analysis are the results summarized in table  [ tab : summary ] . here",
    "we have recorded whether the energy is for a harmonically trapped or a free system , which boundary condition is used and which values of the interaction strength and particle numbers it is valid for .",
