    "search for planetary or brown dwarf ( bd ) companions to bds are of primary interest for understanding planet and bd formation .",
    "there exists no widely accepted model for the formation of bds ( e.g. luhman et al .",
    "the frequency of bds in multiple systems is a fundamental parameter in these models .",
    "however , it is poorly constrained for close separations : most of the current surveys for companions to bds are done by direct ( adaptive optics or hst ) imaging and are not sensitive to close binaries ( @xmath7au and @xmath8au for the field and clusters , respectively ) , and found preferentially close to equal mass systems ( e.g. bouy et al .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring for radial velocity ( rv ) variations provides a means to detect close systems .",
    "the detection of the first spectroscopic bd binary in the pleiades , ppl15 ( basri & martn 1999 ) , raised hope to find many more of these systems in the following years .",
    "however , the number of confirmed close companions to bds and very low - mass stars ( vlms , @xmath9 ) is still small . to date , there are three spectroscopic bd binaries known , i.e. for which a spectroscopic orbital solution has been derived : ppl15 , the very young eclipsing system 2m0535 - 05 ( stassun , mathieu & valenti 2006 ) , and a binary within the quadruple gj569 ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "2004 ; simon , bender & prato 2006 ) .",
    "they all have a mass ratio close to unity .",
    "in particular , no rv planet of a bd / vlms has been found yet . if bds can harbor planets at a few au distance is still unknown . among the more than 200 extrasolar planets that have been detected around stars by the rv technique , 6 orbit stellar m - dwarfs showing that planets can form also around primaries of substantially lower mass than our sun .",
    "observations hint that basic ingredients for planet formation are present also for bds ( e.g. apai et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , the only planet detection around a bd is a very wide 55au system ( 2m1207 , chauvin et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is presumably formed very differently from the solar system and rv planets .",
    "rv surveys for planets around such faint objects , as bd / vlms are , require monitoring with high spectral dispersion at 810 m class telescopes . while being expensive in terms of telescope time , this is , nevertheless , extremely important for our understanding of planet and bd formation .",
    "we report here on the recent discovery of a very low - mass companion orbiting the bd candidate chah@xmath28 , which was detected within the course of an rv survey for ( planetary and bd ) companions to very young bd / vlms in the chamaeleoni star forming region ( joergens & guenther 2001 ; joergens 2006 ; joergens & mller 2007 ) .",
    "chah@xmath28 has been monitored spectroscopically between 2000 and 2007 with the echelle spectrograph uves at the vlt 8.2 m telescope at a spectral resolution @xmath10/@xmath11 of 40000 in the red optical wavelength regime .",
    "rvs were measured based on a cross - correlation technique employing telluric lines for the wavelength calibration with an accuracy of the relative rvs between 30 and 500 m/s . as shown in fig.[fig : orbit ] , the rvs of chah@xmath28 are significantly variable on timescales of years revealing the presence of an rv companion ( joergens 2006 ; joergens & mller 2007 ) .",
    "the data allowed us to derive an orbit solution with a reduced @xmath12 of 0.42 .",
    "this best - fit kepler orbit has a mass function of 4.6 @xmath13 , an orbital period of 1590d ( 4.4yr ) , an eccentricity of 0.49 , and an rv semi - amplitude of 1.6kms@xmath3 .",
    "the semi - major axis is of the order of 1au .",
    "it is noted , that the rv variations can not be explained by rotational modulation due to activity ( joergens & mller 2007 ) since the rotation period of chah@xmath28 is of the order of a few days ( joergens & guenther 2001 ; joergens et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the mass @xmath14 of the companion can not be determined directly from a single - lined rv orbit but depends on the primary mass .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of chah@xmath28 , the primary mass is not very precisely determined ( as common in this mass and age regime ) .",
    "using two available estimates for the primary mass , 0.07@xmath15 ( comern , neuhuser & kaas 2000 ) and 0.10@xmath15 ( luhman 2007 ) , @xmath14 is inferred to 15.6 and 19.5@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "this does not take into account errors introduced by evolutionary models .",
    "based on the assumption of randomly oriented orbits in space , the mass ratio q@xmath16m@xmath17/m@xmath18 of chah@xmath28 is with 50% probability @xmath190.2 and with 87% probability @xmath190.4 .",
    "since the rv technique has a bias towards high inclinations , these probabilities can be even higher .",
    "the companion of chah@xmath28 has most certainly a much smaller mass than that of any previously detected close companion of a bd / vlms . for comparison , all other known spectroscopic bd binaries have mass ratios @xmath20 0.6 and the lowest mass bd in these systems has 54@xmath0 ( stassun et al .",
    "the discovery of the rv companion of chah@xmath28 with its rv semi - amplitude of only 1.6kms@xmath3 is an important step towards rv detections of planets around bd / vlms .",
    "in fact , from the uncertainty of the orbit solution , it can not be excluded that the companion of chah@xmath28 has a mass in the planetary regime ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "follow - up rv measurements at the next phase of periastron will clarify this .    with a semi - major axis of about 1au , the companion of chah@xmath28 orbits at a much closer orbital distance than most companions detected around bds so far . in particular , its orbit is much closer than that of recently detected very low - mass companions of bds , like that of 2m1207 ( 55au ; chauvin et al .",
    "2005 ) and that of chxr73 ( 210au ; luhman 2006 ; see luhman , this volume ) .",
    "the favored mechanisms for stellar binary formation , fragmentation of collapsing cloud cores or of massive circumstellar disks , seem to produce preferentially equal mass components , in particular for close separations ( e.g. bate et al .",
    "thus , they have difficulties to explain the formation of the small mass ratio system chah@xmath28 .",
    "however , we know that close _ stellar _ binaries with small mass ratios do exist as well ( e.g. q=0.2 , prato et al .  2002 ) , and without knowing the exact mechanism by which they form , it might be also an option for chah@xmath28 .",
    "considering the small mass of the companion of chah@xmath28 , a planet - like formation could also be possible .",
    "giant planet formation through core accretion might be hampered for low - mass primaries , like m dwarfs , by long formation time scales ( laughlin , bodenheimer & adams 2004 ; ida & lin 2005 ) , though , recent simulations hint that it can be a faster process than previously anticipated ( alibert et al .",
    "2005 ) . on the other hand , giant planets around m dwarfs might form by disk instability ( boss 2006a , 2006b ) , at least in low - mass star - forming regions , where there is no photoevaporation of the disk through nearby hot stars ( e.g. chai ) .",
    "the companion of chah@xmath28 could have been formed through disk instability , either in situ at 1au or , alternatively , at a larger separation and subsequent inwards migration .",
    "chah@xmath28 is extremely young ( 3myr ) and its study allows insight into the formation and early evolution at and below the substellar limit .",
    "chah@xmath28 is only the 2nd known very young bd / vlm spectroscopic binary ( after 2m0535 - 05 , stassun et al .",
    "when combined with angular distance measurements or eclipse detections , spectroscopic binaries allow valuable dynamical mass determinations .",
    "the mass is the most important input parameter for evolutionary models , which rely for @xmath220.3m@xmath23 , only on the two masses determined for 2m0535 - 05 . in order to measure absolute masses of both components of chah@xmath28",
    ", it is required to resolve the spectral lines of both components .",
    "we will try this with crires / vlt at ir wavelength , were the contrast ratio between primary and secondary is smaller .",
    "having an orbital separation of the order of 13milliarcsec , the spatial resolution of current imaging instruments is not sufficient to directly resolve chah@xmath28 .",
    "however , it might be possible to detect the astrometric signal caused by the companion , e.g. with naco / vlt .",
    "this would allow measurement of the inclination of the orbital plane and , therefore , breaking the @xmath24 ambiguity in the companion mass ."
