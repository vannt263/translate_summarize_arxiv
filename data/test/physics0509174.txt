    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will open a new frontier in particle physics due to its higher collision energy and luminosity as compared to the existing accelerators .",
    "the general - purpose atlas and cms experiments at the lhc will employ precision tracking , calorimetry and muon measurements over a large solid angle to identify and measure electrons , muons , photons , jets and missing energy accurately .",
    "therefore , they have great physics potential in discovering many possible new particles . among them",
    "are the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , supersymmetric ( susy ) and other new particles beyond the sm .",

    "the significance calculation in searching for and observation of a physics signal with known location and shape is no longer valid when either the location or the shape of the signal is unknown",
    ". this will be the case for many of the possible new physics signals at the lhc .    in section 2 ,",
    "we give a short review of the significance calculation and current analysis strategy in high energy physics ( hep ) and at the lhc . using a signal with known shape but unknown location as an example ,",
    "we discuss in detail in section 3 the problems of the current significance calculation .",
    "we then describe general procedures for significance calculation and comparing different search schemes in section 4 . in section 5 , we describe a new analysis method and compare it with the current `` sliding - window '' approaches following these procedures .",
    "detailed comparison results are also given in this section .",
    "summary and discussion are given in section 6 .",
    "in this note we limit ourselves to the significance calculation and analysis method used in searching for an individual decay mode of new physics signals .",
    "in the field of hep , a common strategy to detect a physics signal is to search for an excess of events in a certain region of a kinematic observable .",
    "the observation probability is given by poisson statistics :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the number of the expected events to be observed in the region , and @xmath2 is the number of the observed events in this region . when @xmath1 is large ( over 25 , for instance ) , the significance of an observation can be approximated well by @xmath3 of gaussian statistics , where @xmath4 .    in hep ,",
    "the significance of an observation is defined by the probability that such an observation is due to statistical fluctuation of background events .",
    "when we claim an observation has a significance of @xmath5  @xcite , the common criterion for a hep discovery , the probability that the claimed discovery is due to statistical fluctuation of background events , known as the type i error rate in statistics , needs to be less than @xmath6 .",
    "the background fluctuation probabilities which define the 1@xmath7 to 5@xmath7 significances in hep are shown in table  [ tab : sig - def ] .",
    ".the definition of significance in hep and the corresponding background statistical fluctuation probabilities . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ result30 ]    the work and results for 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 and 35 signal events embedded with gaussian means at 42.00 , 46.00 , 48.00 , 49.00 , 49.50 , 49.75 , 49.90 and 50.00 are shown in ref .",
    "the results for 10 , 20 , and 30 signal events embedded are shown in tables  [ result10 ] ,  [ result20 ] and  [ result30 ] .",
    "we can see that the number of signal embedded experiments successfully found with a certain significance is much lower than what expected from @xmath3 calculations .",
    "this is a price we have to pay for not knowing the exact location of the signal .",
    "furthermore , for the `` sliding - window '' method , the sensitivity strongly depends on the exact location of the embedded signal .",
    "if the step size is greater than 1 , the embedded signals are totally missed for the worst - case scenarios . for step size of 1 or less , there are still significant differences in the sensitivities between the best - case and worse - case scenarios , depends on the step size of the `` sliding - window '' used to scan the kinematic range . in comparison ,",
    "the new analysis method is independent of the exact location of the gaussian mean of the embedded signal events .",
    "this is because the new method scans the entire parameter space for the best fit to the entire experiment .",
    "the maximum @xmath3 from `` sliding - window '' approaches with step sizes of 16 , 4 , 1 , and 0.1 for the best - case scenario mc experiments each with 20 signal events embedded are shown in figure  [ fig : sw-20-best ] .",
    "similarly , the maximum @xmath3 from `` sliding - window '' approaches with step sizes of 16 , 4 , 1 , and 0.1 for the worst - case scenario mc experiments each with 20 signal events embedded are shown in figure  [ fig : sw-20-worst ] .",
    "the maximum likelihood output of the best fits for mc experiments with 5 , 10 , 20 and 30 signal embedded are shown in figure  [ fig : ml - signal ] .",
    "compared to `` sliding - window '' approaches with a step size small enough not to miss the worst - case scenarios , the sensitivity of the new analysis method is significantly higher .",
    "this means that the new analysis approach is a significantly better and more sensitive scheme to search for new physics signals at the lhc than the current `` sliding - window '' method .",
    "= 0.90    = 0.90    the analysis method described above performs a scan of the entire parameter space using unbinned maximum likelihood fits at every small interval of the parameter space .",
    "it is very cpu - intensive .",
    "the 13.45 million background - only and 630,000 signal embedded mc experiments were generated and analyzed over several months with about 10 dual - cpu servers .",
    "we have examined the significance calculation and analysis methods in searching for an individual decay mode of a new physics signal at the lhc . unlike the search for a physics signal with known location and shape , the significance calculation for new physics signals with unknown location or shape strongly depends on the details of the search scheme and the situation it applies to . using a signal with known shape but unknown location as an example",
    ", we have demonstrated that the significance calculation using the current `` sliding - window '' method at the lhc is over - estimated .",
    "this is because we search for an excess of events over multiple narrow windows , but the significance is still calculated according to an individual narrow window .",
    "the significance and sensitivity of the `` sliding - window '' method strongly depends on the specifics of the method and the situation it applies to , e.g. the step size of the `` sliding - window '' used to scan the available kinematic range , the total available kinematic range to search for the new physics signal , and the exact location of the new physics signal , etc .",
    "we describe general procedures for significance calculation and comparing different search schemes .",
    "we have applied the procedures and compared the current `` sliding - window '' approaches with a new analysis method .",
    "the proposed new analysis method uses maximum likelihood fits with floating parameters and scans the parameter space for the best fit to the entire sample .",
    "we find the results of the new analysis method is independent of the location of the new physics signal and significantly more sensitive in searching for new physics signal than the current `` sliding - window '' approaches .",
    "while the lhc experiments have great potential in discovering many possible new physics signals , we need to be extremely careful in evaluating the significance of an observation from the real lhc data . because possible new physics can show up in many kinematic observables , over a very large kinematic range",
    ", the fluctuation probability of background events will be much higher .",
    "for individual decay modes of new physics signals , the expected significances in observing the new physics signal will be much smaller than current expectations  @xcite .",
    "combining independent decay modes of the same new physics signal will be essential to establish the discovery of the new physics signal .",
    "significant observations of the same new particle in independent decay modes at consistent locations will be the most effective way to establish the discovery of this new particle",
    ". careful evaluation of the observation significance in each individual decay mode following the general procedures described in this paper is the starting point , before we can evaluate the significance of the observations of independent decay modes .",
