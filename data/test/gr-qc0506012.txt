    "astrodynamical space test of relativity using optical devices ( astrod ) @xcite aims at testing relativistic gravity , measuring the solar - system parameters with high precision and detecting gravitational waves from massive black holes and galactic binary stars .",
    "the concept of astrod is to put two spacecraft in separate solar orbits and carry out laser interferometic ranging with earth reference stations ( e.g. a spacecraft at the earth - sun l1/l2 points ) . a simple version of astrod , astrod i , has been studied as the first step to astrod @xcite .",
    "astrod i employs one spacecraft in a solar orbit and carries out interferometric ranging and pulse ranging with ground stations .",
    "the main scientific goals of astrod i are to test relativistic gravity and the fundamental laws of spacetime with three - order - of - magnitude improvement in sensitivity and to improve the solar , planetary and asteroid parameter determination by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "the technological goal of astrod i is to prepare for the astrod mission .",
    "the acceleration disturbance goal of the astrod i proof mass is @xmath0ms@xmath1hz@xmath2 at frequency @xmath3 of 0.1mhz .",
    "the power spectral density of the allowed level of the acceleration noise is shown in figure [ fig : curve ] . assuming a 10ps one - way timing accuracy ( 3 mm ranging accuracy ) and the acceleration noise of @xmath0ms@xmath1hz@xmath2 at frequency of about 0.1mhz",
    ", a simulation for 400 days ( 350750 days after launch ) showed that astrod  i could determine the relativistic parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the solar quadrupole parameter @xmath6 to levels of 10@xmath7 , 10@xmath7 and 10@xmath8 , respectively @xcite . in the simulation ,",
    "( i ) the timing noise is modeled as gaussian random noise ; ( ii ) unknown acceleration noise is modeled to have gaussian random magnitude with zero mean and with standard deviation 10@xmath9ms@xmath1 and to have its direction changed randomly every 4h ( equivalent to 10@xmath10ms@xmath1hz@xmath2 for @xmath3 @xmath11 0.1mhz assumed as the requirement of the drag - free system ) and ( iii ) five range points are taken each day ( at 0.2d interval ) .",
    "longer term systematic effects will be studied in a future paper .",
    "this simulation agrees with the scientific goals of astrod  i. the timing uncertainty of event timer reaches 3ps in satellite laser ranging at present .",
    "space qualified versions of similar accuracy are under development . for a ranging uncertainty of 3 mm in a distance of 3 @xmath12 10@xmath13 m ( 2au ) ,",
    "the laser / clock frequency needs to be known to one part in 10@xmath14 . this can be set as a requirement of the space laser / clock or a requirement for laser frequency monitoring through ground clock and modeling . as to ground station jitter ,",
    "monitoring to an accuracy of 3 mm is required and can be achieved .",
    "the atmospheric effects on laser propagation will be monitored and subtracted to mm - level by using 2-color ( 2-wavelength ) ranging ( one color for pulse ranging and one for interferometric ranging ) .",
    "these measurement uncertainties are not cumulative in the range determination while the acceleration disturbances accumulate in time in the geodesic deviations . in order to achieve the acceleration disturbance goal ,",
    "a drag - free control system using capacitive sensors will be employed .    in order to decide on detailed designs of the accelerometer for astrod i",
    ", we have to know the sources and magnitude of acceleration disturbances that could arise in the accelerometer . in this paper",
    ", we carry out analyses , mainly based on existing literature on acceleration disturbances for other gravitational missions ( lisa @xcite and the lisa pathfinder @xcite ) , to give a preliminary overview of the acceleration disturbance to the astrod i proof mass .",
    "based on the analyses , we infer some of the requirements for the designs of the astrod i payload and spacecraft .",
    "also , we compare parameter values we have assumed in the analyses with those for lisa to confirm the feasibility of the requirements for astrod i.    first , we will give an overview of the astrod i configuration ( section [ configuration ] ) and the control - loop model we assumed ( section [ control - loop ] ) .",
    "then , we will estimate the magnitude of acceleration disturbances and requirements for astrod i in sections [ ans ] to [ st : requirements ] , and compare the requirements of astrod i with lisa in section [ comparison with lisa ] .",
    "the astrod i spacecraft has a cylindrical shape with diameter 2.5 m and height 2 m .",
    "its cylindrical side is covered by solar panels .",
    "the cylindrical axis is perpendicular to the orbit plane and the telescope is set to point toward a ground laser station .",
    "the effective area of receiving sunlight is about 5m@xmath15 and it can generate power that is larger than 500w .",
    "the total mass of the spacecraft is about 350 kg and that of payload is 100120 kg ( see @xcite for more detailed descriptions of the configuration ) .",
    "the orbit distance from the sun varies from about 0.5au to 1au ( figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the proof mass ( @xmath16 = 1.75 kg ) is a rectangular parallelepiped ( 50 @xmath12 50 @xmath12 35mm@xmath17 ) made from au - pt alloy ( density @xmath18 = 2 @xmath12 10@xmath19kgm@xmath20 ) .",
    "the six sides of the proof mass are surrounded by electrodes mounted on the housing for capacitive sensing and control .",
    "the gap between each side of the proof mass and the opposing electrode is 2 mm .",
    "assumed values for the capacitance and voltages are listed in table [ table : parameter values ] .",
    "various acceleration disturbances would act on the proof mass in different ways . in order to infer how these different kinds of acceleration disturbances would contribute to the total acceleration disturbance of the proof mass , we tentatively assume a simple single - mass and single - axis control - loop model @xcite .",
    "the diagram is shown in figure  [ fig : control - loop ] .",
    "the relative difference between the displacement disturbance amplitudes of the proof mass and of the spacecraft , @xmath21 , with position readout noise @xmath22 , is measured by the position displacement sensor .",
    "the output of this sensor is converted to acceleration disturbance @xmath23 , by a transfer function @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this acceleration is supplied to the thruster and the output acceleration disturbance with thruster noise @xmath26 is applied to the spacecraft .",
    "the spacecraft also experiences acceleration disturbances by coupling to the proof mass with a coupling constant @xmath27 and external environmental disturbances ( @xmath28 ) that work directly on the spacecraft .",
    "the total acceleration of the spacecraft @xmath29 is converted to the position noise @xmath30 with a transfer function @xmath31 .",
    "we consider only the sensitive axis of the proof mass without actuation .",
    "the proof mass would experience disturbances by spacecraft - proof mass coupling and environmental disturbances @xmath32 ( see section [ anp ] ) .",
    "the total acceleration disturbance of the proof mass @xmath33 is converted to the displacement disturbance @xmath34 with a transfer function @xmath35 .    from this control - loop model ,",
    "we obtain the following linear loop equations @xcite : @xmath36    by solving these equations for @xmath34 , and assuming @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 (= @xmath41 ; @xmath42 is nominally 1 and its effects are absorbed in @xmath24 and @xmath26 ) , we obtain ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "this acceleration disturbance has to be less than the acceleration noise goal of @xmath45ms@xmath1hz@xmath2 at @xmath3 = 0.1mhz .",
    "we will estimate the values of the direct acceleration disturbances of the spacecraft ( @xmath28 and the thruster noise @xmath46 ) in section [ ans ] and of the proof mass ( @xmath32 ) in sections [ anp ] and [ back - action ] , and the stiffness @xmath27 in section [ stiff ] .",
    "we will discuss the requirements for @xmath22 and @xmath38 in section [ st : requirements ] .",
    "the spacecraft would be affected by environmental disturbances that stem from , for example , solar radiation pressure , solar wind and micrometeorite impacts . among these sources of disturbances ,",
    "solar radiation pressure is considered to be the major contributor to the acceleration disturbances ( section 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution from solar wind might be comparable to radiation pressure , but the spectral behavior of the solar wind is not well known .    by assuming a perfectly reflecting surface of the spacecraft , acceleration noise caused by fluctuation in solar irradiance @xmath47 is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the area of the spacecraft facing the sun , @xmath50 is the mass of the spacecraft and @xmath51 is the speed of light in vacuum . from the data of the virgo experiment on soho @xcite , fractional fluctuation in solar irradiance is @xmath52hz@xmath2 at 0.1mhz ( figure 6 of @xcite ) . assuming that @xmath53 is the same at 0.5au , and taking a total irradiance of 5500wm@xmath1 , the area of 5m@xmath15 and a mass of 350 kg , we obtain @xmath54 = 9.8 @xmath12 10@xmath55ms@xmath1hz@xmath2 .",
    "the impact rate of 1-ng meteorites on the astrod i spacecraft ( its surface area is 25.5m@xmath15 ) is about 7 events per day or about 0.08mhz .",
    "the average velocity of meteorites is 18kms@xmath56 in an earth frame near the earth ( figure 7.2 - 30 of @xcite ) .",
    "an impact of 1-ng meteorite with the average velocity of 18kms@xmath56 on the surface of the spacecraft ( 350 kg ) without reflection produces a linear velocity increment of about 5 @xmath12 10@xmath57ms@xmath56 .",
    "smaller meteorites have larger flux ( figure 7.2 - 29 of @xcite ) , but their impacts on velocity changes are smaller .",
    "therefore , the contribution to the acceleration disturbances at 0.1mhz seems insignificant , in comparison with the effect of solar radiation pressure .",
    "however , because such discrete changes could directly affect the astrod  i experiment , the impact effects have to be studied carefully in detail .",
    "in addition to the acceleration noise from the environmental disturbances , the spacecraft would suffer from the thruster noise . a force fluctuation of 10@xmath58nhz@xmath2 in thruster",
    "corresponds to the acceleration disturbance of @xmath46 = 2.8 @xmath12 10@xmath8ms@xmath1hz@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the rss ( root - sum - square ) of these acceleration disturbances is : @xmath59 at 0.1mhz , dominated by the thruster noise . as per @xcite , lisa requires a force fluctuation to be less than a few @xmath58nhz@xmath2 .",
    "however , recent studies for the lisa pathfinder indicate that force noise up to 0.1mnhz@xmath2 at 0.1mhz can be tolerated by increasing the gain @xcite ; the lisa study team is designing high gain loops and the requirement has been relaxed .",
    "direct proof - mass acceleration disturbances can be classified into two categories depending on their origins @xcite : environmental disturbances ( @xmath60 ) and proof - mass sensor back - action acceleration disturbances ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the former includes disturbances related to magnetic effects ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) , impact effects ( by cosmic ray ( @xmath67 ) and residual gas ( @xmath68 ) ) , temperature dependent effects ( radiometric and outgassing effects ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) and thermal radiation pressure ( @xmath71 ) ) and gravity gradients caused by thermal distortion of the spacecraft ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the latter is originated from voltage fluctuations ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , charge fluctuations ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , readout electronics ( @xmath77 ) , patch field voltages ( @xmath78 ) and thermal voltage noise by dielectric losses ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "parameter values and physical constants used for the estimations are listed in tables [ table : parameter values ] and [ table : physical constants ] , respectively .",
    "table [ table : pm acceleration disturbances ] provides a summary of the expressions used to estimate the direct proof - mass acceleration disturbances and the estimated values .",
    "the disturbances noted as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73-@xmath76 in table  [ table : pm acceleration disturbances ] correspond to @xmath80-@xmath81 and @xmath82-@xmath83 in @xcite , respectively in @xcite , would not arise in astrod  i , as the laser beam is not to be injected directly on the surface of the astrod  i proof mass . ] .",

    "more accurate estimation would be obtained by carrying out the following works dedicated for astrod  i : ( a ) modeling local magnetic fields of the spacecraft , ( b ) estimating the effective charging rate of the proof - mass , ( c ) estimating the cosmic - ray impact rate of the proof - mass , ( d ) estimating the micrometeorite impact effects , ( e ) thermal modeling of the proof - mass housing and the spacecraft , ( f ) gravitational modeling that includes thermal and non - thermal deformation of the spacecraft and the payload , ( g ) electrostatic modeling for the capacitive sensors and ( h ) estimating environmental factors ( such as the interplanetary magnetic field , solar wind , solar radiation and cosmic rays ) in the varying orbit ( 0.5au to 1au ) . simulations to estimate charging rates for astrod  i are in progress @xcite .",
    "we have tentatively estimated acceleration disturbances for astrod  i. this work has allowed us to set preliminary requirements for astrod  i. to improve the current estimation , the disturbances that have not been studied yet have to be included and more detailed modeling works are necessary for astrod  i. in comparison with lisa , requirements for astrod  i can be largely relaxed .",
    "this will make the technological developments for astrod  i less demanding to meet the drag - free requirements .",
    "this work was funded by the national science council and the foundation of minor planets of purple mountain observatory .",
    "we thank a. rdiger , s. vitale , d. k. gill , a. pulido patn , and , especially , the referees for useful information on acceleration disturbances and helpful comments on the manuscript .",
