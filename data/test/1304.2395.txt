    "a single component srsic profile is generally found to be a good representation of the light profile for individual galaxies at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "prior to stacking , each light profile was converted into a mass profile by normalizing the light within @xmath61  kpc to the total stellar mass of each galaxy . while a more thorough analysis would be required to properly account for @xmath19 gradients ( see , e.g. ,",
    "* ) , the present analysis provides a first order view into the evolution in the radial distribution of stellar mass .",
    "below , however , we also examine how different @xmath19 values in the central and outer radial regimes impact the measured stellar mass growth .",
    "in addition , we will explore the impact of @xmath19 gradients for a broader sample in followup work .",
    "figure  [ fig_mass_profiles](b ) shows the ratio of the mass profiles at higher redshifts to the sdss mass profile . below @xmath62 , stellar mass",
    "is continually built up at all radii .",

    "clearly more mass has assembled at larger radii since @xmath0 , leading to larger @xmath65 toward low redshift .",
    "however , the amount of stellar mass in the central regions , where bulges and pseudobulges are common structural features in nearby late - type galaxies @xcite , has also increased . some portion of the growth in the central regions is due to star formation as h@xmath7 maps for sfgs at @xmath66 are centrally peaked @xcite .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with recent observations of stars in the milky way bulge that display a wide range of metallicities and ages , implying an extended formation history @xcite .",
    "the ongoing mass assembly in the central regions may point to secular processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as an important channel for bulge growth for sfgs in the stellar mass regime studied here .",
    "we estimate the impact on the stellar mass growth in the two different radial regimes due to variation in @xmath19 ratios .",
    "these @xmath19 ratios can be derived from the correlation with galaxy colors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for each galaxy in our sample",
    ", we use the psf deconvolved best - fit galfit models in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands to estimate the observed @xmath67 colors inside and outside of @xmath63  kpc ( @xmath68  kpc was used for the upper bounds on the outer radial regime ) . the median color difference between the different radial regimes ( outer minus central )",
    "is , from low ( @xmath69 ) to high redshift ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath71 , and @xmath72  mag .",
    "the outer regions are therefore bluer at all redshifts .",
    "the @xmath73 values were then converted into @xmath74 values using the slope of the correlation between @xmath75 and @xmath67 , where @xmath76 represents the observed @xmath22 ( for the sample at @xmath44 ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath77 ) bands . in deriving these @xmath19-color correlations at different redshifts ,",
    "we employed a broad sample of galaxies , including both qgs and sfgs above a mass of @xmath78 so that a wide array of stellar populations were sampled . from low to high redshift , we find @xmath79 and @xmath80  dex  mag@xmath11 .",
    "the scatter in @xmath75 about these correlations is @xmath81  dex .",
    "while some of this scatter is caused by working in the observed frame with a sample spanning a range of redshifts , it is similar to what is found in other recent works ( e.g. , @xmath82  dex in * ? ? ?",
    "we multiply our median light profile at a given redshift by the step function implied by @xmath74 ( re - normalizing to the median mass of the sample ) and integrate as before to determine the mass in the central and outer regions ( open circles with dashed lines in figure  [ fig_mass_profiles](c ) ) . for the sdss light profile",

    "we adopt the average value between their etg and ltg samples ( @xmath83 ) since these two classes were divided by , among other properties , their sersic indices with a cut at @xmath84 , which is close to the median value for our sdss sample .",
    "the overall conclusion , compared to the case where @xmath19 is assumed to be constant with radius , is unchanged , as both radial regimes undergo mass growth since @xmath85 but with the outer regions building up relatively more mass .",
    "given the significant mass assembly found at large radii , we compare our results in such a region of our galaxy that has been well documented , the solar neighborhood . though we caution that the milky way is just one such sfg , and may not be one that is an archetypal late - type @xcite , this analysis nevertheless provides an intriguing comparison between our lookback study and galactic archeology .",

    "* ) for the milky way from @xcite but scaled down by @xmath87  dex to account for the difference in mass with our descendant sfgs at @xmath4 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in this correction may account for the slight offset from the sdss mass profile , though the rough agreement is still remarkable .",
    "@xcite estimate a mean formation time for stars in the solar neighborhood that corresponds to @xmath88 . assuming this mean is close to the median formation redshift , therefore implying a factor of @xmath9 growth below @xmath89 , this estimate is close to the factor of @xmath90 growth in our mass surface density from @xmath88 ( green line ) to the sdss mass profile at @xmath8  kpc .",
    "two caveats to the analysis presented here warrant some consideration .",
    "first , the contribution of stars formed ex situ to the stellar mass growth is an uncertain quantity , though there is evidence that it is minimal .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite find that for local halos of mass @xmath91  @xmath18  ( hosting centrals of stellar mass @xmath2 ) , little stellar mass was accreted . at the lowest redshifts , @xcite find a growing contribution , but this is likely driven by the dominance of qgs in their halos at low redshift , which primarily grow from mergers .",
    "major mergers are likely rare in our sample at @xmath92 as such events tend to destroy disks , contrary to what is observed at low redshift ( figure  [ fig_mwps ] ) .",
    "second , the qg fraction increases toward low redshift and as a result not all sfgs at @xmath93 will be progenitors of sfgs at low redshift as some will have quenched .",
    "this would impact our results if there is a relation between the structure of high redshift sfg progenitor candidates and low redshift qg descendants , as the former would bias our measurements for the median structural property .      in this paper",
    ", we have used the evolution in the ssfr - mass relation to determine the expected stellar mass growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for progenitors of sfgs like the milky way .",
    "we used 3d - hst redshifts and photometry to select sfgs of the appropriate progenitor mass at different redshifts back to @xmath3 and _ hst _ candels imaging to follow their structural evolution .",
    "as these sfgs grew in stellar mass by a factor of @xmath9 since @xmath3 , most of the new stellar mass assembled in the outer regions , leading to a factor of @xmath5 increase in the half - light radius .",
    "the mass surface density profiles indicate ongoing stellar mass assembly also in the central regions where bulges and pseudobulges are common features in spirals .",
