    "the theory of inflation provides an explanation for many observed properties of our visible universe , in particular its homogeneity and isotropy ( see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "it also gives an explanation for the origin of small density perturbations which eventually gave rise to the structures in our universe .",
    "these aspects are well understood . however , from the particle physics point of view , a suitable candidate for the inflaton field has yet to be found  @xcite . among the many candidates , hybrid inflation  @xcite is a particularly well motivated one , especially in supersymmetric models  @xcite@xcite .",
    "there has been a lot of recent work investigating the possibility of realising inflation within string theory ( see e.g.  @xcite@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the most natural framework for brane inflation is the brane - antibrane system where an attractive force leads to a potential for the interbrane distance  @xcite@xcite .",
    "inflation ends with an open string tachyonic instability similar to hybrid inflation .",
    "this scenario has been extensively studied and leads to interesting phenomena such as @xmath4-string formation at the end of inflation .",
    "one particular issue in these models comes from the need for moduli stabilisation during inflation .",
    "if this is not achieved , the potential for the moduli is of runaway type destroying the existence of slow roll inflation .",
    "this problem can be circumvented using the kklt scenario whereby the kahler moduli are stabilised once the complex moduli have been stabilised and non - perturbative gaugino condensation has occurred on d7 branes  @xcite . the coupling to inflation has been studied in kklmmt where a fine - tuning of the inflaton superpotential has been advocated  @xcite .",
    "one can also use a shift symmetry to alleviate the @xmath2 problem  @xcite@xcite .",
    "another way of realising hybrid inflation in string models can be obtained using the d3/d7 system , see e.g.  @xcite@xcite . in this case",
    "the end of inflation happens at a lower scale than the planck scale , when the charged open string fields between the branes condense .",
    "the d3/d7 system can be modelled using an @xmath5 supersymmetric @xmath4-term inflation model  @xcite .",
    "the interbrane distance plays the role of the inflaton and the charged open strings between the branes are the waterfall fields .",
    "when the supergravity corrections are neglected , i.e.  in global supersymmetry , and assuming that the kahler moduli have been stabilised , the inflaton direction is flat .",
    "slow roll inflation is driven by the one loop logarithmic corrections as the one loop quadratic divergences are inflaton - independent .    in this paper",
    ", we are investigating @xmath0-term hybrid inflation with the inflationary superpotential @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath8 gauge coupling , in the presence of additional moduli fields .",
    "it would be very interesting to derive the origin of @xmath9 from fundamental string theory  @xcite .",
    "we treat the supergravity case going beyond the global supersymmetry analysis .",
    "we show that the treatment of fayet - iliopoulos @xmath4-terms ( i.e.  when @xmath10 ) needs extra care in supergravity . to include such a term would require additional fields and the study of their stabilisation . for simplicity we therefore do not include inflationary @xmath4-terms in our models .",
    "inflation is then driven by the presence of the non - vanishing @xmath9 .",
    "we show that supergravity corrections , and supergravity - induced interactions with a moduli sector induce a tree level slope and mass for the inflaton  @xcite .",
    "moreover there are additional contributions from the quadratic divergence part of the one - loop corrections , since they are inflaton - dependent in supergravity , as opposed to inflaton - independent in global supersymmetry . in general",
    "these effects spoil the flatness of the inflationary potential . we show that most of the tree - level problems can be removed by including shift symmetries in the inflaton sector , and taking the moduli sector to be no - scale .",
    "it then appears that a viable slow - roll inflation model can be found with limited fine - tuning of the moduli sector .",
    "however we also find that the coupling between the inflaton and the moduli has the effect of inducing a small variation of the moduli during inflation . despite the small size of this variation",
    ", it gives a significant contribution to the inflaton slope and violates slow - roll inflation .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec : v ] , we construct the full potential for our combined model of inflation and moduli stabilisation .",
    "we calculate tree and one loop level parts of the potential , and describe symmetries which help maintain the flatness of the inflaton potential . in section  [ sec : mod ] we determine the role of moduli fields during inflation , and show their effect is significant .",
    "we find the constraints corresponding to the cobe normalisation and the wmap3 spectral index constraint in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "our arguments and analysis apply to a general moduli sector , although as a specific example , we also give explicit results for the kklt model , which has just one moduli field @xmath11 . in section",
    "[ sec : kklt ] we study particular choices of racetrack superpotentials for the kklt scenario , and find that the running of the moduli field during inflation typically leads to a large value of @xmath2 .",
    "a small value of @xmath2 could only be achieved if the moduli superpotential is heavily fine - tuned .",
    "finally in section [ sec : nogo ] we consider models where a minkowski vacuum after inflation is obtained without the need for a lifting term . a model with this property",
    "is also interesting as it may give a small gravitino mass , as is required to have an low energy sparticle spectrum .",
    "we derive a no - go theorem which states that , for no - scale models with no lifting term , no such stable supersymmetry breaking minkowski vacua can be found .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "as already discussed , many string theory inflation scenarios can be modelled at low energy with a supergravity description of hybrid inflation .",
    "the system uses three fields , the inflaton @xmath12 measuring the inter - brane distance and two charged fields @xmath13 ( which in the d3/d7 system would represent the open strings between the two types of branes ) .",
    "the fields interact according to the superpotential  ( [ inflasec ] ) with @xmath10 , which has been studied extensively in the literature . in  @xcite it was shown how the fayet - iliopoulos @xmath4-term arose from fluxes on the d7 brane , allowing @xmath4-term inflation in this system . here",
    "we will focus almost exclusively on hybrid inflation which is driven only by @xmath0-terms ( so @xmath14 ) , although exactly how such terms are embedded in string theory remains to be found . including inflationary @xmath4-terms in a supergravity theory",
    "creates extra complications , as we will discuss in the following subsection .      using  ( [ inflasec ] ) and taking to @xmath15",
    "we obtain @xmath16 this potential has an @xmath17 origin which was derived in  @xcite . during inflation , when the waterfall fields @xmath18 , the potential is @xmath19 which gives a positive contribution to the inflation energy .    extending this model to a supergravity theory , and working in units with @xmath20",
    ", we replace the above @xmath0-term by @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the kahler potential for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the simplest possibility would be @xmath24 .",
    "it was originally thought that extending the @xmath4-term in the above model to sugra would be straightforward .",
    "however it was later discovered that in order to have a fayet - iliopoulos term @xmath25 appearing in a supergravity theory , the superpotential must have charge @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "thus the extension of  ( [ susyinf ] ) to sugra described in the earlier paper  @xcite requires reconsideration . to preserve the properties of @xmath12 and its role as the inflaton",
    ", it should be uncharged  @xcite .",
    "this is only possible when @xmath10 and the charges of @xmath13 are shifted to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "now all the contributions to @xmath29 from any other sectors of the theory would also have to be charged .",
    "this would be for instance the case with the mssm superpotential .",
    "since they are , _ a priori _ , unrelated to inflation , this seems unnatural .",
    "hence we have an incompatibility between a non - vanishing @xmath9 and a fayet - iliopoulos term @xmath25 . in the usual inflationary scenario ,",
    "inflation is driven by the fayet - iliopoulos term .",
    "one possibility is to introduce a fayet - iliopoulos term with a gauge invariant superpotential .",
    "this can be achieved in supergravity with a @xmath4-term by making the @xmath30 pseudo - anomalous .",
    "we extend the model to include one modulus @xmath31 and matter fields @xmath32 , all of which are charged under the pseudo - anomalous @xmath30 gauge group .",
    "the relevant part of the kahler potential for these fields is @xmath33 where the gauge field , @xmath34 has been included ( the usual kahler potential appearing in the scalar potential expression is obtained by putting @xmath35 formally ) .    the potential arising from the @xmath4-term is then @xmath36 where we have taken the gauge coupling function to be @xmath37 in order to cancel the @xmath30 anomaly .",
    "we see that a fayet - iliopoulos term can give rise to inflation when @xmath10 , assuming that @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be stabilised by a suitable superpotential .    during inflation ,",
    "the waterfall fields @xmath13 vanish .",
    "this implies that the @xmath30 @xmath4-term and the @xmath9 dependent part of the @xmath0-term potential give rise to the inflation energy @xmath38 when @xmath10 and the extra fields are stable , this resembles the usual inflation energy in hybrid inflation .",
    "if on the other hand we just use the @xmath0-term to give inflation , there is no need to introduce the additional fields @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "the fayet - iliopoulos @xmath4-term must then be zero , due to the gauge invariance of @xmath29 , so @xmath39 .",
    "we will take @xmath40 and assume this is the case for the rest of the paper .",
    "the string theory origin for @xmath9 has yet to be found  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the hybrid inflation scenario based on the superpotential above  ( [ inflasec ] ) .",
    "we are also taking into account the effects of a separate sector , so the total superpotential is @xmath41 the @xmath42 are moduli and matter fields , which are usually assumed to be stable during inflation . with one modulus in @xmath0-theory",
    "no stabilisation was obtained  @xcite .",
    "here we consider the most general case in supergravity with more than one moduli field and generic superpotential @xmath43 .",
    "the moduli dependent part of the superpotential @xmath43 is then responsible for stabilising the moduli fields .",

    "the above expressions reduce to @xmath54    at the end of inflation , the charged fields @xmath13 condense and the inflaton @xmath12 is zero .",
    "the @xmath30 @xmath4-term part of the potential is then zero , and @xmath0-term part reduces to @xmath55 .",
    "this part of @xmath56 , which comes from the moduli dependent part of the superpotential @xmath43 , is then responsible for stabilising the moduli fields . for @xmath57",
    "its minimum is an @xmath58 vacuum where supersymmetry is preserved , i.e.  @xmath59 for all the fields .",
    "since we want a minkowski vacuum at the end of inflation , it is necessary to add an additional lifting term , @xmath60 to the potential . in the kklt scenario a non - supersymmetric lifting term",
    "is used @xmath61 where @xmath62 depending on the origin of the term , i.e.  @xmath63 for anti d3-branes and @xmath64 for fluxes on @xmath65 branes .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the minimum is raised by an uplifting @xmath4-term  @xcite .",
    "this allows one to lift the @xmath58 vacuum while avoiding the need for a non - supersymmetric potential . in this case",
    "the set of fields @xmath42 comprises one modulus @xmath11 and matter fields @xmath66 , all of which are charged under a second , pseudo - anomalous @xmath67 gauge group .",
    "the kahler potential in the moduli sector can be written as @xmath68 unlike the kklt case it is not no - scale , although it is straightforward to write down a no - scale version .",
    "the potential arising from the @xmath4-term for the additional @xmath67 is then @xmath69 if @xmath70 and all @xmath71 are positive , this potential will be nonzero and provide a suitable lifting term . as explained in  @xcite , an @xmath58 vacuum in supergravity can not normally be lifted by @xmath4-terms .",
    "one can circumvent this argument by using non - analytic superpotentials with positive definite @xmath4-terms , as described in  @xcite .",
    "the total moduli stabilisation potential is then @xmath72 where @xmath73 is given by , for example , ( [ nslift ] ) or ( [ dlift ] ) .",
    "after inflation , the potential possesses a minkowski vacuum thanks to the presence of the lifting term .    for the rest of the paper we will only concentrate on the case where there are no additional matter fields @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that the gauge invariance of the superpotential can only be maintained if @xmath11 is gauge invariant , and we must use the non - supersymmetric lifting term  ( [ nslift ] ) .",
    "this is the minimal setting to study hybrid inflation coupled to moduli .",
    "the structure of this potential is rather rich due to the possible interplay between the moduli and other fields . during hybrid inflation ,",
    "the fields @xmath13 vanish , and the inflaton field is real , so @xmath74 .",
    "the full ( tree - level ) potential then reads @xmath75 where we have identified @xmath76 and @xmath77 in addition to the terms above , there will be contributions from loop corrections , which we will discuss in the next subsection .",
    "note that the inflaton is much smaller than the planck mass , i.e.@xmath78 is such that @xmath79 . during inflation ,",
    "the minkowski vacuum is lifted by @xmath80 .",
    "we see that in general we will get large , tree - level contributions to the slope and mass of the inflaton  @xcite ( from @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively ) . in other words",
    "the model has @xmath1 and @xmath2 problems .",
    "this new @xmath2 problem comes from the inclusion of the moduli sector , and is distinct from the usual @xmath2 problem which comes from embedding inflation in supergravity . in the case of no - scale models",
    "@xmath83 , and so this @xmath2 problem can be removed by a symmetry of the kahler potential @xmath84 . to obtain a small inflaton slope",
    ", we will need to fine tune @xmath81 .",
    "the form of the potential discussed so far was based on the hybrid inflationary epoch , in which the fields @xmath85 vanish .",
    "inflation ends when the mass matrix acquires a tachyonic direction .",
    "this usually occurs when one of the two charged fields @xmath13 ( or a combination thereof ) has a negative mass , i.e.  when @xmath86 . without moduli fields",

    ". however , due to the presence of the moduli fields , the value of @xmath90 is altered .",
    "note that if we had used a more general @xmath23 , which did not have the shift symmetries , then @xmath90 would have received far more corrections .",

    "we naturally expect that @xmath29 will be much larger than the inflation scale @xmath9 in order to stabilise moduli during inflation .",
    "we see that both shift symmetries must be included in @xmath94 for inflation to be viable .    in the above discussion",
    "we have considered how the moduli sector will alter inflation .",
    "of course we must not forget that the inflationary sector can also interfere with the moduli stabilisation , since the inflation potential @xmath80 acts as a perturbation of the moduli potential @xmath95 . in the kklt scenario",
    "the minimum of @xmath96 is separated from @xmath97 ( which also has @xmath98 ) by a potential barrier . denoting the height of the barrier by @xmath99",
    ", we see that the value of the above potential  ( [ inflapotential ] ) must be less than @xmath99 during inflation , or the modulus field @xmath11 will roll off to infinity , and inflation will not finish in the correct vacuum .",
    "the slope terms in the above potential must be small ( in order to have slow - roll inflation ) , so we need @xmath100 .",
    "this guarantees that the minimum of the moduli potential is only shifted during inflation and not completely destroyed .",
    "typically @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the energy of the ads minimum of @xmath51 ( if @xmath73 were absent ) .",
    "this provides a rough estimate of the barrier height . in this case",
    "we need @xmath103 , which is reasonable if the inflation scale is far below the moduli stabilisation scale .",

    "this is guaranteed provided the potential @xmath43 is lower than the cut - off , i.e.  lower than the planck scale in practice .",
    "this is also a phenomenological requirement in order to obtain a hierarchy between the planck mass and the gravitino mass .",

    "we get @xmath116 to which we need to add the loop corrections  ( [ strinf ] ) .    in this paper , we take the cut off at the planck scale . hence ,",
    "as long as @xmath117 and @xmath29 do not vanish during inflation , the radiative corrections induce a slope for the inflationary potential , which is dependent on @xmath29 , and which can in principle be a danger to the flatness of the inflationary potential .",

    "in this section we will discuss the form of the effective inflationary potential , taking into account the moduli stabilisation mechanism .",
    "it is usually assumed that moduli fields are stabilised before inflation begins .",
    "the energy scale of the corresponding potential is much higher than that of inflation , and so the effects of the inflaton will not significantly alter the values of the moduli fields .",
    "it therefore seems reasonable to assume the moduli are fixed during inflation .",
    "as we will show , this is not the case .",
    "let us now analyse the moduli stabilisation mechanism when the inflation sector is present .",
    "we denote the values of the moduli fields at the minimum of @xmath124 by @xmath125 , and define @xmath126 to be the deviation of the moduli fields from this value . expanding the inflationary potential around this minimum",
    "we find @xmath127 where @xmath128 are independent combinations of @xmath129 and @xmath130 which satisfy @xmath131 @xmath132 .",
    "minimising this with respect to @xmath128 , we find @xmath133 so we see that the moduli fields are now stabilised along a valley depending on @xmath12 . if @xmath134 ( which is perfectly reasonable ) , then @xmath135 , and the variation of the moduli fields is tiny , as is usually assumed .",
    "the correction to the inflationary potential is tiny too .",
    "however the slope of @xmath51 is also tiny , and so the contribution of the moduli fields can be comparable to the other effects we are considering . hence it is not reasonable to ignore their variation during inflation after all .",
    "now if we substitute the above expression  ( [ yeq ] ) back into the potential  ( [ vy ] ) , we obtain the effective inflationary potential @xmath136 with slope @xmath137 and effective mass @xmath138 \\ , .\\ ] ] we remind the reader that loop corrections are included in these expressions .",
    "hence , we see for a wide range of models ( including the kklt scenario ) that @xmath139 , and so the inflaton is tachyonic .",
    "this tachyonic instability is not necessarily a problem if @xmath12 is small , or the mass term is subdominant .",
    "since we need the field to roll towards zero during inflation we also require that @xmath140 is positive .    it is tempting to use a moduli sector whose superpotential satisfies @xmath141 at the minimum , since @xmath142 in this case , and so we automatically avoid any large contributions to the slow - roll parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this type of model has other appealing features , such as a small gravitino mass  @xcite .",
    "if we consider just one moduli field @xmath11 , and take a no - scale @xmath84 , then we see from ( [ kkltv2 ] ) that loop corrections give a small negative inflaton mass .",
    "the effects of the moduli variation will make it even more negative .",
    "even if this mass is small , it will still dominate the behaviour of @xmath12 , and cause it to roll away from zero .",
    "hence we see that a moduli potential with @xmath143 at its minimum ( i.e.  unbroken supersymmetry ) can not be successfully combined with @xmath0-term hybrid inflation .",
    "we have established that during inflation the effective potential has the leading order form @xmath144 with @xmath140 positive and @xmath145 negative . the potential has the form of an inverted parabola .",
    "since we want inflation to end by the tachyonic instability of the @xmath146-field , @xmath12 has to roll towards zero .",
    "this means that during inflation @xmath147 .",
    "thus , an additional constraint on the model parameters is that @xmath148 , as given in  ( [ phiend ] ) . to get an idea about the allowed parameter ranges for the theory , making only modest assumptions about the moduli sector , we provide some general constraints on potentials of the form  ( [ workingmodel ] ) , leaving @xmath149 , @xmath140 and @xmath145 as free parameters , but with @xmath145 negative . note that @xmath149 , @xmath140 and @xmath145 depend on the underlying theory and are _ not _ independent . as shown in the previous section , they depend on the details of the moduli sector as well as the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "an inflationary model has to satisfy certain constraints in order to agree with observations .",
    "firstly , in order to realise a period of slow - roll inflation , the two slow - roll parameters @xmath150 and @xmath151 have to be small ( we have approximated @xmath152 during inflation ) .    also , in order to get the right amplitude for the density perturbations from inflation , the cobe normalisation must hold  @xcite @xmath153 the current wmap+2dfgrs constraint on the spectral index is  @xcite @xmath154 ( a weaker bound has been found in  @xcite ) . in the case",
    "that @xmath155 , the above two constraints are fulfilled when @xmath156 and @xmath157 the constant @xmath140 can be eliminated from the last expression , using  ( [ norm ] ) .",
    "since @xmath145 is negative and @xmath158 , this restricts the parameters to be in the region ( in planck units ) @xmath159 implying an upper bound for the inflationary scale of order @xmath160 gev .",

    "in order to generate slow - roll inflation , we require that @xmath162 and @xmath163 note that if we had not included the contribution from the variation of the moduli fields , we would instead have @xmath164 .",
    "in general , the above contributions to @xmath2 from the moduli sector are likely to be large .",
    "we see this type of model may have another @xmath2 problem , which is not removed by the symmetries we used in section  [ sec : v ] to avoid the other two @xmath2 problems .    using  ( [ v0con ] ) , which follows from the cobe and spectral index constraints ( [ cobe ] ) and ( [ nsconstr ] )",
    ", we find that @xmath165 this is consistent with @xmath166 , as we have assumed ( and is required , for example , for @xmath96 to retain its minimum during inflation ) .",
    "finally , for the maximal allowed value of @xmath167 gev , the relative contribution of gravitational waves @xmath168 is 13 percent .",
    "however , it can be easily shown that the field variation @xmath169 during inflation , related to the e - fold number by @xmath170 is larger than @xmath171 ( with @xmath172 ) , as long as @xmath173 gev . since field variations below the planck scale are preferred theoretically , its very likely that the predicted amount of gravitational waves is much lower .      here",

    "now for a generic supersymmetry breaking model , the holomorphic mass matrix is such that @xmath286 . expanding along the direction @xmath287 where @xmath288 is the minimum leads to a potential @xmath289 notice that this leads to a tachyonic direction as before , implying that the supersymmetry breaking extremum with zero cosmological constant is not stable .",
    "hence we see that a supersymmetry breaking minkowski vacuum from a no - scale theory which does not use a lifting term can not be stable .",
    "since such a setup does not even stabilise the moduli fields , it is certainly not suitable to use in a hybrid inflation model .",
    "in this paper we considered @xmath0-term hybrid inflation in supergravity , when moduli fields are present . in the literature",
    "it is usually assumed that moduli fields are stabilised before the period of slow - roll inflation begins and that they therefore have no impact on the dynamics of the inflaton field .",
    "we have shown that this is not necessarily the case .",
    "firstly , the tree - level coupling of moduli and inflaton fields in supergravity induces a slope and , in general , a mass term in the potential for the inflaton field . on top of this",
    ", loop corrections from both the inflation and moduli sectors of theory contribute to the slope and curvature of the potential .",
    "a further problem comes from the evolution of the moduli fields during inflation .",
    "since they are stabilised by a steep potential , they are roughly constant during inflation . however , despite the small size of their variation , we have shown that they still give a significant contribution to the effective inflaton potential .",
    "this generally leads to a large and tachyonic mass for the inflaton .",
    "we find that this class of model has up to three different @xmath2 problems .",
    "firstly there is the usual one coming from embedding hybrid inflation in supergravity ( which is avoided with the help of shift symmetries ) .",
    "secondly there are tree - level contributions to the inflaton mass from the coupling of the inflaton to the moduli sector ( although these are absent for no - scale models ) .",
    "finally there is the negative contribution to the effective inflaton mass from the rolling of the moduli fields during inflation .",
    "it is not obvious that this third @xmath2 problem can be removed with natural additional symmetries .",
    "the model also has an @xmath1 problem due to the tree - level contributions to the inflaton slope from the moduli sector .",
    "we found that in the popular model for moduli stabilisation , the kklt scenario , the induced mass term for the inflaton field is generally too big to give a period of slow - roll inflation .",
    "it seems that only with a heavily fine - tuned superpotential for the moduli sector may viable slow - roll inflation take place .    to conclude",
    ", we have shown that the coupling of moduli fields to hybrid inflation can have an important impact on the effective inflationary potential .",
    "neglecting this coupling is not consistent and , as we have seen , generally leads to incorrect conclusions about the inflationary dynamics .",
    "these considerations are also relevant to other inflationary scenarios .",
    "in each case it should be checked that the moduli fields , even if thought to be stabilised , do not spoil the flatness of the inflationary potential , and therefore the dynamics of the inflaton field .    we would like to thank k. dasgupta and r. kallosh for comments on a previous version of the manuscript and n. chatillon and u. ellwanger for discussions .",
