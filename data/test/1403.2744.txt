    "the ultracold quantum gases have been the test bed to investigate the many - body physics @xcite .",
    "thanks to the versatile advances in the experiments , the interaction strength @xcite , the optical lattice depth , and the dimensionality can be manipulated to study strongly correlated quantum gases . to name a few ,",
    "the typical atomic systems involve luttinger liquid of one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose gases @xcite , a three - dimensional ( 3d ) bose - mott insulator @xcite , and the superfluid state of two - component fermi gases @xcite .",
    "conventional experimental measurements of the atomic many - body systems include the time - of - flight experiment , the noise correlations measurement @xcite , the bragg scattering spectroscopy @xcite , and the in - situ imaging @xcite .",
    "recently , we investigate the spectrum of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite in the strongly correlated atomic systems @xcite as an alternative and non - destructive method @xcite to probe the quantum many - body physics .    the eit spectrum is shown to be solely determined by the single - particle green s function of the ground - state atoms .",
    "non - trivial many - body effect for the spectrum is predicted @xcite when the atoms are virtually coupled to the low - lying rydberg states @xcite .",
    "the single - particle green s function is crucial for many - body systems , from which the observable of any single - particle operator , the ground state energy , and the excitation spectrum can be extracted @xcite .",
    "similar to the well - known angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite , where the single - particle green s function is probed to investigate the electronic structure of the surface in the solids , the eit spectroscopy accesses the information of it as well .",
    "what differs is the single - particle green s function in arpes is directly measured whereas the eit spectrum involves an integral of the green s function and the functional laser parameters @xcite .",
    "a recent proposal of probing spin correlation functions by ramsey interferometry @xcite provides the other direct way to measure the dynamical green s function of the many - body systems .     in ultracold atomic systems ,",
    "matter wave interference patterns are powerful to reveal the many - body physics .",
    "for example in two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite , the contrast of interference fringes relates to the spatial single - particle green s function @xcite .",
    "therefore , the algebraic decay of spatial correlation in the contrast indicates the quasi - long - range order in the system , which can be fully described by green s function .",
    "in addition , the second - order correlation function in the interference pattern of two 1d bose gases is also manifested to provide the evidence of luttinger liquid signatures @xcite .  on the contrary to the destructive interference method , quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) detection of quantum matter @xcite",
    "provides a least destructive measurement .",
    "it can be used to effectively map the quantum correlations of the ultracold atoms into light signals , which is similar to our proposed eit scheme in this paper .",
    "the common feature of matter wave interference and eit spectrum in probing the quantum many - body physics is that the measurements respectively involve the average and integral of the green s function , making both methods the indirect probes .",
    "nevertheless the eit spectroscopy has the advantage of non - destructive probe with well - controlled laser parameters , which may provide more efficient and precise measurements on the ultracold atoms .    in this paper , we demonstrate that the dynamical single - particle green s function of the many - body system can be determined by eit spectroscopy .  in section",
