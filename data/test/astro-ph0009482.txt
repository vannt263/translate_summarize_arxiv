    "the evolution / behavior of be at the lowest metallicities , the presence and magnitude of scatter ( if any ) , the presence and location of a possible change of slope along the trend , and a successful solution of the oxygen dilemma ( high or flat ) in the galactic halo are some of the still missing inputs .",

    "being both lines well resolved , equal weights were assigned .",
    "the beryllium abundance thus derived using kurucz 1d lte model atmosphere is @xmath26 n(be / h)= @xmath29  dex , significantly higher than what is expected from extrapolating the previously observed trends to these low metallicities ( under the assumption that the be abundance keeps decreasing ) .",
    "the magnitude of the error - bar assigned to our measurement mainly comes from the dependence of the beryllium abundance on changes in the stellar parameters . in order of importance , we find that @xmath30be = @xmath20.1 dex for @xmath31 , @xmath30be = @xmath20.04 dex for @xmath32 , and @xmath30be = @xmath2 0.03 dex for @xmath30[fe / h ] = @xmath33 dex . to these values",

    "as expected , the predicted line strengths with the 3d model atmosphere are quite similar to the 1d case , because the lines are formed in the deep atmospheric layers due to the lines being very weak and coming from the majority ionized species .",
    "assuming lte , the abundance correction derived by using 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres is only  0.03  dex for 313.1 in g6412 , in the sense that the 1d abundance should be corrected upwards with 0.03  dex .",
    "it should be emphasized that the 1d-3d comparison has been done strictly differentially .",
    "the quoted differences are therefore estimates of the systematic errors due to the adopted model atmospheres one can expect when using a 1d analysis , regardless of whether kurucz or marcs model atmospheres have been used .",
    "+ although the above - mentioned 3d effects are small , it should be borne in mind that these estimates assume lte and there is no guarantee that the same will be true for nlte .",
    "recent improved 1d nlte calculations appropriately done for g64 - 12 with a very extended be atom ( 71 levels compared to the 9 used by garca lpez et al .",
    "@xcite ) , find some small but significant nlte effects . in terms of abundance ,",
    "the nlte abundance is 0.07  dex larger than the lte result . in spite of the similarity with the lte result",
    ", it should be noted that the line formation for the lines is far from being in lte , since the dominant nlte effects  over - ionization and over - excitation  have opposite influence on the line strength and thus the effects partly cancel .",
    "this may suggest that for some other stellar parameters the nlte effects could be significantly larger .",
    "the details of the 1d nlte calculations for appropriate for a range of stellar parameters will be presented elsewhere ( garca perez et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "it also remains to be investigated whether the steep temperature gradients and inhomogeneities in 3d model atmospheres may drive more pronounced departures from lte , similar to recent calculations for li and o ( asplund & carlsson @xcite ; asplund et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "our claim to have detected a significantly higher beryllium abundance in g6412 ( compared to other low metallicity stars ) can be more clearly seen when our new ( 1d lte , for consistency with the rest of the sample ) determination is plotted in a @xmath26 n(be / h ) vs. [ fe / h ] graph ( cf fig .",
    "3a ) together with carefully selected literature data of similar quality .",

    "cf primas et al .",
    "@xcite ) , gives more weight to the hypothesis of a possible flattening of the be trend at the lowest metallicities , at the moment , the interpretation of our new result is not straightforward .",
    "+ according to vangioni - flam et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the finding of high be abundances in stars with metallicity below [ fe / h ] = @xmath03.0 may favor shock acceleration in the gaseous phase of superbubbles produced by collective snii explosions as the main mechanism of be production .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the major role is played by the most massive stars only ( say , with initial mass m @xmath34 60m@xmath35 ) . + according to the parizot & drury ( @xcite ) scenario , a double trend of be vs o ( and fe ) is expected depending on if the star formed inside a superbubble ( hence with a high be content due to the effect of collective sn explosions ) or outside . in this case , we can not exclude the possibility that g6412 may be representative of the `` high '' trend , whereas other previously studied very metal - deficient stars ( like bd@xmath0133442 , for instance , boesgaard et al .",
    "@xcite ) formed out of gas outside a superbubble . in order to test this hypothesis , new detections of beryllium in this challenging metallicity range are needed .",
    "+ one last possibility that should not be underestimated is the effect due to 3d and nlte corrections .",
    "as previously stated , nlte corrections have usually been assumed to be negligible , but they could be important for different combinations of stellar parameters .",
    "the future results of garca perez et al .",
    "work will shed light on this issue .",
    "we have presented a new analysis of the near - uv part of the spectrum of g6412 with the aim of studying its beryllium content .",
    "the high quality of this uves ( science verification ) spectrum has led to a clear detection of beryllium .",
    "this is the first measurement of be in a star of such low metal content ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath03.3 ) .",
    "we have performed our analysis with 1d lte model atmospheres , but introduced the novelty of correcting it for both 3d and non - lte effects .",
    "hence , our final 3d nlte be abundance is @xmath26 n(be / h ) = @xmath36 .",
    "we have shown that when compared in a consistent manner to previous high quality literature data , the be abundance here detected is significantly higher than what expected .",
    "the strength of the oh molecular lines is comparable to what observed in other stars of similar metallicity , thus excluding the possibility that the high be content measured in g6412 may be somehow related to an abnormally high o content .",
    "furthermore , our measurement disagrees with the statement of a parallel (   same rate ) increase of be and fe , which , in turn , suggests a flattening or the presence of dispersion at given metallicity in the be vs fe trend during the early evolutionary phases of our galaxy .",
    "we thank the science operations ( on paranal ) and the uves science verification teams for the efforts devoted to taking the observations and releasing the data to the eso member states .",
    "a. garca perez is thanked for making available to us her first results on new nlte be calculations , as well as e. depagne for checking the h@xmath5 fitting procedure .",
