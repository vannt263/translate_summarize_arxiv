    "the unprecedented progress of laser technology in the recent decade made available the realization of femtosecond laser sources with relativistic : @xmath0 ( in optical domain ) and ultrarelativistic intensities up to @xmath1  by the chirped pulse amplification technique @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the next generation of ultrarelativistic lasers will significantly exceed these intensities in the near future @xcite .",
    "the interaction of such powerful electromagnetic radiation with matter opens real possibilities for revelation of ultrafast laser - matter interaction dynamics in supershort time scales with new research fields , such as relativistic optics mourou , rel - rep1,rel - rep2 and attoscience @xcite , as well as many nonlinear electrodynamic effects at the ultrarelativistic interaction with the qed vacuum and accelerator beams @xcite .    at the laser - matter interaction the high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) by atoms",
    "/ ions @xcite is a subject of extreme interest , since hhg is one of the most promising mechanisms for creation of coherent xuv sources @xcite and intense attosecond pulses atto3 , in particular , for the control of electrodynamic processes on attosecond time scales . to reach a far x - ray region",
    "one needs the atoms or ions with a large nuclear charge and laser fields of ultrahigh intensities at which the nondipole interaction and relativistic effects become essential @xcite . at such intensities",
    "the state of ionized electron becomes relativistic already at the distances @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the wavelength of a laser radiation ) irrespective of its initial state , hence the investigation of laser - atom / ion induced processes such as stimulated bremsstrahlung ( sb ) , above threshold ionization ( ati ) etc .",
    ", require relativistic consideration @xcite . specifically , the relativistic drift of a photoelectron due to the magnetic field of a strong electromagnetic wave becomes the major inhibiting factor in the relativistic regime of hhg . due to this drift",
    "the significant hhg suppression takes place and diverse schemes have been proposed to overcome this negative effect @xcite . for compensation of the magnetic drift in relativistic domain , in refs .",
    "@xcite , scheme5 two counterpropagating laser pulses of linear and circular polarizations were considered , respectively , at which the configuration of a standing wave is formed .",
    "the effect of resulting magnetic field of the standing wave is vanished near the stationary maxima at the waves linear polarizations @xcite . while at the circular polarizations of counterpropagating laser pulses one can achieve the fully vanishing of resulting longitudinal magnetic force , responsible for magnetic drift scheme5",
    ". however , the latter takes place at the adiabatic turn on of the waves @xcite , which is not valid for short laser pulses of relativistic intensities .",
    "so , a standing wave configuration formed by the two counterpropagating laser beams of linear polarizations is of interest due to the simplicity to realize such field structure providing incomparable large hhg rates in the relativistic regime . at the lengths much smaller than a wavelength of a pump wave the effective field of the standing wave",
    "may be approximated by the uniform periodic electric field .",
    "note that the consideration of the hhg in the field of a standing wave in the paper @xcite is based on the semiclassical model , and only the first order relativistic effects have been taken into account .",
    "the entire relativistic quantum - mechanical consideration of the hhg in a standing wave or in a nonstationary strong electric field on the base of the dirac equation is still lacking .    to overcome the suppression of the hhg in the relativistic regime caused by the magnetic field of a strong laser pulse , in the present work the relativistic hhg by hydrogenlike ions in the uniform periodic electric field , formed by the two linearly polarized counterpropagating laser beams of relativistic intensities , at the distances much less than a laser wavelength ,",
    "is studied .",
    "we propose also a scheme of relativistic hhg in plasma , where a traveling laser pulse in the own frame of reference ( moving with the pulse group velocity in plasma ) is transformed into the uniform periodic electric field , i.e. the wave magnetic field in this case vanishes completely , in contrast to a standing wave configuration formed by the counterpropagating laser beams .",
    "so , it is also feasible the effective hhg in plasma with the copropagating ultraintense laser and fast ion beams of the same velocities . note that in refs .",
    "@xcite a scheme with counterpropagating relativistic ion and laser beams was considered , where due to the large doppler upshift the high harmonic frequency may appear in the @xmath4-@xmath5 domain .    the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present analytic and fully relativistic quantum theory of hhg arising from the dirac equation . in sec .",
    "iii with the help of fast fourier transform algorithm we present hhg spectrum for diverse ion and field parameters .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in sec .",
    "let two linearly polarized plane electromagnetic waves with carrier frequency @xmath6 and amplitude of the electric field @xmath7@xmath8propagating in the opposite directions in vacuum , interplay with the hydrogenlike ions having the charge number of the nucleus @xmath9 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the characteristic size of the atomic system and @xmath12 is the wavelength of a pump wave ( for the hhg this condition is always satisfied ) .    at the photoionization of an atom / ion in the strong traveling wave field taking into account the relativistic drift due to the magnetic field",
    ", one can expect that the probability of ionized electron recombination with ionic core could be non - negligible only if the electron is initially born with a nonzero velocity oppositely directed to incident laser beam .",
    "the probability of tunneling ionization with nonzero initial velocity is given by quantum mechanical tunneling theory @xcite as : @xmath13where @xmath14 is the initial velocity , and @xmath15 is the electric field strength of the wave ( here and below , unless stated otherwise , we employ atomic units ) .",
    "however , according to ( [ ion ] ) the ionization probability falls off exponentially if this velocity @xmath14 becomes larger than the characteristic atomic velocities , irrespective of it s direction .",
    "since we study the case of superstrong laser fields with @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the relativistic invariant parameter of the wave intensity ) when the energy of the interaction of an electron with the field over a wavelength becomes comparable to the electron rest energy , the required velocities becomes comparable with the light speed @xmath18 ( @xmath19 @xmath20 ) .",
    "hence , the probability ( [ ion ] ) in the such fields is practically zero .",
    "therefore , in considering case of a standing wave formed by the laser beams ( [ waves ] ) , a significant input in the hhg process will be conditioned by the ions situated near the stationary maxima of the standing wave . for this points the magnetic fields of the counterpropagating waves cancel each other .",
    "since the hhg is essentially produced at the lengths @xmath21 , we will assume the effective field to be : @xmath22where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the unit polarization vector .",
    "as is clear from the above consideration for hhg , one needs to exclude the relativistic drift of a photoelectron due to the magnetic field of a traveling wave , i.e. the magnetic component of the wave .",
    "this can also be achieved in the plasma- like medium with a refractive index @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , let a plane , transverse , and linearly polarized electromagnetic wave with a frequency @xmath6 propagates in plasma ( @xmath26 ; @xmath27 is the plasma frequency ) . for the electric and magnetic field strengths we have@xmath28 ,   \\label{pet}\\]]where",
    "suppose that an ion beam copropagates together a laser beam in such plasma with a mean velocity @xmath30 equal to a laser beam group velocity : @xmath31 . to find out the hhg rate it is convenient to solve the problem in the center - of - mass ( @xmath32 ) frame of ions .",
    "in this frame the wave vector of the photons is @xmath33 .",
    "the traveling electromagnetic wave is transformed in the @xmath32 frame into the field avet - book:@xmath34@xmath35hence , in the frame of ions center - of - mass the problem of hhg in a plasma is reduced to one in vacuum in the field of the same configuration ( [ et ] ) with @xmath36 .",
    "when @xmath37 , one needs relativistic ion beams . concerning the ion beams of necessary relativism @xmath38 , note that the relativistic ion beams in arbitrary charge states , with the lorentz factor up to about @xmath39 is supposed to be realized at the new accelerator complex at gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung ( gsi ) ( darmstadt , germany ) .",
    "it is worthy to note that if a laser frequency @xmath6 is close enough to plasma frequency @xmath40 , one can achieve the implementation of proposed scheme for hhg with nonrelativistic ion beams . in this case one can use quasimonoenergetic and low emittance ions bunches of solid densities generated from ultrathin foils -nanotargets by supershort laser pulses of relativistic intensities target .    to find out the relativistic probabilities of hhg in the field ( [ et ] ) we arise from the dirac equation:@xmath41where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the dirac matrices in the standard representation , @xmath44 are the pauli matrices and",
