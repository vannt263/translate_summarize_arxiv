    "particle interferometry provides a tool to study the final stage of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "intensity interferometry is based on the hanbury - brown twiss , or hbt , effect .",
    "the hbt analysis in relativistic high - energy heavy - ion experiments was originally motivated by theoretical predictions that a large source size and the long duration of particle emission @xcite would be observed due to softening of the equation - of - state in a first - order phase transition from a quark - gluon - plasma state . to analyze the hbt data ,",
    "the bertsch - pratt parameterization is employed in a longitudinal co - moving ( lcms ) frame , where the three - dimensional gaussian radii are parameterized to be ,  and  @xcite . assuming a cylindrically symmetric , longitudinally expanding , transversely homogeneous source ,  corresponds to a radial size of the source , while  is a combination of the radial size and a temporal term of the source duration time . to study the space - time evolution of the source , we introduce two independent external parameters : the transverse momentum of the particle pair and the collision centrality .",
    "the transverse momentum , , of the pair is defined by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the transverse momentum of each particle in the pair .",
    "recently , transport models @xcite have been used to predict the radius parameters and their  dependence .",
    "we will compare our results to these predictions .",
    "the phenix detector provides powerful particle identification ( pid ) capabilities over a wide momentum range @xcite . in this analysis , charged pions and kaons are identified by the time - of - flight technique using the beam - beam counters and the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) , combined with momentum measurement by the drift chamber ( dch ) .",
    "the detector covers the pseudorapidity region @xmath2 and @xmath3 in azimuthal angle .",
    "the timing resolution is approximately 500 ps .",
    "charged pions and kaons are identified in squared mass versus momentum space using momentum - dependent pid bands which take into account the emcal timing resolution and dch momentum resolution .",
    "charged pions and kaons must lie within 1.5@xmath4 of their squared mass peak , but 2.5@xmath4 away from neighboring pid bands . using 50 million minimum bias events , @xmath570 million charged pions and @xmath56 million",
    "charged kaons are selected in a momentum range from 0.2 to 2.0 gev / c .",
    "similar to our previous analyses at  = 130 gev @xcite , two - track separation cuts were applied using the dch and emcal such that pairs within 1 cm in the longitudinal direction and 0.02 radians in the azimuthal direction of each other are removed to eliminate ghost tracks and dch inefficiency .",
    "pairs that share the same cluster in the emcal are also removed .",
    "the systematic error of the resultant radius parameters from these pair cuts is about 10@xmath6 in total .",
    "the systematic error is evaluated by varying the condition of pair cuts , and the amount of the changes of radius parameters . after the pair cuts ,",
    "about 160 million charged pion pairs and 1 million charged kaon pairs remain .",
    "the statistics are 70 times larger than that obtained in the previous runs @xcite .",
    "a full coulomb correction was applied assuming a gaussian source without pairs coming from resonance decays @xcite .",
    "the systematic error originating from the coulomb correction is small compared to the systematic errors for the pair cuts .",
    "figure  [ fig : kaon3d ] shows projections of the three - dimensional correlation function onto @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 for positive pions ( top ) and negative kaons ( bottom ) after the full coulomb correction .            ) with statistical error bars and systematic error bands . in the left figure ,",
    "results from phenix and star at 130 gev @xcite are shown .",
    "the error bars are statistical only .",
    "[ fig : routside],width=604,height=264 ]",
    "figure [ fig : ktdep ] shows the  dependence of the chaoticity and the bertsch - pratt radius parameters of pions at the most central 30@xmath6 of the cross section .",
    "the radius parameters at  = 200 gev are , within errors , equal to the corresponding results at 130 gev @xcite at the same .",
    "while the radius parameters show a strong  dependence , the chaoticity is constant in all the  bins .",
    "the kaon radius parameters are slightly larger than those of pions at the same  ( the  bin for kaons is between 0.2 to 2.0 gev / c ) as shown in fig .  [ fig : ktdep ] ; however , the kaon chaoticity is significantly larger than that of pions .",
    "figure [ fig : npdep ] shows the collision centrality dependence of the radius parameters .",
    "the number of participants ( @xmath10 ) is evaluated from the charged particle multiplicity using a glauber model calculation @xcite .",
    "the radius parameters depend linearly on @xmath11 . in order to study the duration time , we plot  in fig .",
    "[ fig : routside ] as a function of ( a )  and ( b ) centrality .",
    "the ratio is independent of centrality and is constant for  up to 1.2 gev / c within error , and is systematically below one .",
    "we have presented hbt results in the bertsch - pratt frame for identified charged pions and kaons measured by phenix in au+au collisions at  = 200 gev .",
    "we have obtained the three - dimensional correlation functions with 160 million charged pion pairs and 1 million kaon pairs .",
    "a clear  dependence of the pion radius parameter was found , in agreement with the results at  = 130 gev .",
    "the kaon radius parameters are equal to or slightly larger than the pion radius parameters at the same  bin .",
    "the pion radius parameters are consistent with a linear parameterization as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "it should be noted that the measured radius parameters in the transverse directions (  and ) contradict recent transport model predictions @xcite .",
    "however , the measured longitudinal radius parameter ( ) is well reproduced by those models .",
    "the  ratios are independent of both  and centrality , and are systematically smaller than unity albeit with large errors .",
    "no evidence is seen for the anomalous increase of  as predicted from calculations based on the formation of a qgp @xcite",
