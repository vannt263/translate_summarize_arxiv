    "it is well known that the usual long range order characteristic of a ferromagnetic phase dominated by exchange interactions can be destroyed by the presence of dipolar interactions inducing the formation of magnetic domains  @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "typically when perpendicular anisotropy is present , the dipolar interactions are antiferromagnetic in character and compete with the ferromagnetic exchange interactions  @xcite giving rise to antiferromagnetic or stripe phases .",
    "these phases are common in ferromagnetic thin films with perpendicular anisotropy and have been the subject of intense experimental  @xcite , theoretical  @xcite and numerical  @xcite work in the last 20 years . in the strong anisotropy limit",
    "an ultrathin film can be modeled by a system of magnetic dipoles on a square lattice in which the magnetic moments are oriented perpendicular to the plane of the lattice , with both nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic exchange interactions and long - range dipole - dipole interactions between moments .",
    "the thermodynamics of this system is ruled by the dimensionless ising hamiltonian : @xmath0 where @xmath1 stands for the ratio between the exchange @xmath2 and the dipolar @xmath3 interactions parameters , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "the first sum runs over all pairs of nearest neighbor spins and the second one over all distinct pairs of spins of the lattice ; @xmath5 is the distance , measured in crystal units , between sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the energy is measured in units of @xmath8 .",
    "the equilibrium phase diagram of this system has been extensibly studied  @xcite , while several dynamical properties at low temperatures were studied in @xcite .",
    "the threshold for the appearance of the stripe phase in this model is @xmath9  @xcite . for @xmath10",
    "the system presents a sequence of striped ground states , characterized by a constant width @xmath11 , whose value increases exponentially with @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that in the range @xmath12 the system presents a first order phase transition between a low temperature stripe phase and a high temperature tetragonal phase with broken translational and rotational symmetry . in a subsequent work",
    "@xcite it was shown that for a narrow window around @xmath13 the model shows an intermediate nematic phase , between the stripe and tetragonal ones , where the system has short range positional order but long range orientational order .",
    "the nematic phase exists between two critical temperatures @xmath14 . for finite sizes these are actually pseudo critical temperatures @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with finite energy barriers between phases .",
    "the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit gives @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) we can estimate @xmath15 and @xmath16 as the average between the positions of the minimum of the cumulant and the maximum of the specific heat , so @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "for the range of system sizes considered ( @xmath19 ) the energy barriers between the nematic and the tetragonal phases are rather small , while the barriers between the stripe and the nematic phases are very large  @xcite . hence , under a cooling from high temperature no metastable tetragonal states",
    "are observed , but we see a strong metastability in the nematic phase .",
    "this can be observed in fig.19 of ref.@xcite .",
    "although metastability strongly resembles a first order phase transition , we were not able to determine the nature of the stripe - nematic transition unambiguously : while the nematic order parameter presents a jump at @xmath23 and the free energy barriers seem to diverge in the thermodynamic limit , the internal energy is continuous at the transition and the peak in the specific heat tends to saturate  @xcite .",
    "further mc simulations showed that the nematic phase is present also for other values of @xmath24 in different parts of the phase diagram , mainly around the phase borders between striped states of different widths  @xcite .    here",
    "we study the out of equilibrium dynamical properties of the two dimensional ising model with exchange and dipolar interactions described by the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton1 ] ) with @xmath13 .",
    "we performed quenches of the system from initial conditions at high temperatures directly to the stripe phase ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "our main result is the identification of two kinds of processes : a slow coarsening towards a metastable nematic phase followed by nucleation of the stripe phase in a background of the metastable nematic and also direct coarsening of the stripe phase without an intermediate nucleation process ( see fig.[quench ] ) . in each realization",
    "the system chooses one of both paths to the final stripe phase with probabilities that depend on the final temperature of the quench .",
    "we computed these probabilities from monte carlo simulations and then using arguments from homogeneous nucleation theory , finite size scaling analysis and known growth laws for critical dynamics we were able to characterize completely both kinds of processes in the whole temperature range below the stripe - nematic transition .",
    "we also made slow cooling experiments , similar to those already discussed in @xcite and which show strong hysteretic behavior in the energy .",
    "we confirm that hysteresis is associated with a strong metastability of the nematic phase , while the tetragonal phase shows negligible metastability in the energy under cooling .",
    "finally , ( quasi-)equilibrium autocorrelation functions obtained for a whole range of temperatures between the tetragonal and the stripes phases show slow relaxation characterized by stretched exponential decay . in the stripe",
    "phase the relaxation times obtained from the autocorrelations exhibit a strong growth which can be well fitted by a vogel - fulcher - tamman relation , similar to the behavior of fragile glass formers , with a relatively high ( @xmath26 ) divergence temperature .    in section",
    "ii we describe the quench experiments and the associated phenomenology . in section iii the slow cooling experiments and the behavior of the equilibrium correlations are discussed . in section",
    "iv we present a discussion of results and brief conclusions .",
    "we performed quenches from infinite temperature ( completely random initial configuration ) down to temperatures @xmath27 .",
    "we also compared with the case where the initial configuration is taken from an equilibrated state at temperatures @xmath28 .",
    "the results were the same .",
    "the typical relaxation behavior can be appreciated in fig.[quench ] , where we plotted the time evolution of the instantaneous energy per spin @xmath29 for two different realizations of the stochastic noise , together with typical spin configurations along the evolution .",
    "we see that the system can relax through two different types of mechanisms . in fig.[quench]a",
    "the system relaxes first into a metastable nematic state , where it stays during a long time @xmath30 , after which suddenly relaxes to the equilibrium striped state .",
    "in other words , there is a two - step relaxation : first a coarsening process , where domains of the nematic phase compete ( horizontal and vertical stripe orientations ) , followed by a nucleation of the stable phase ( we will verify this quantitatively later ) . in fig.[quench]b",
    "the system form domains of both the stable ( striped ) and metastable ( nematic ) phases that compete and relax directly to the equilibrium state through a coarsening process .",
    "both types of relaxation processes can happen with certain probability which depends on the temperature . to analyze quantitatively these processes we computed the equilibration time probability distribution .",
    "the equilibration time @xmath30 is defined as the time ( in monte carlo steps , mcs ) that the system takes to reach the stable , crystal  like striped state after a quench .",
    "the criterium to determine @xmath30 was the following . for each quench temperature @xmath27 we calculated the equilibrium energy per spin histogram along a large single mc path starting from the ground state .",
    "this histogram presents two gaussian  shaped peaks , each one centered at the averages @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite . between the two peaks",
    "the histogram presents a finite minimum ( at least for a finite system ) , associated with the free energy barrier that separates both phases .",
    "we also measured the standard deviation of the low energy peak associated with the striped phase @xmath33 and defined @xmath34 , verifying that it is well below the central minimum of the histogram ; @xmath35 is almost independent of the system size for @xmath36 , so it can be easily calculated using small system sizes .",
    "then for each quench we calculated the average energy per spin @xmath37 . when @xmath38 fell bellow @xmath35 we stopped the simulation defining @xmath39 ( see fig.[quench ] ) .",
    "repeating this procedure we obtained the probability distribution ( normalized frequency ) @xmath40 of the stochastic variable @xmath30 for different values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the above mentioned relaxation mechanisms are reflected in a characteristic two - peak structure in @xmath40 , each one centered at typical values corresponding to well different time scales , as shown in figs.[histop1 ] and [ histop2 ] .",
    "this probability distribution can be very well fitted using a superposition of two log  normal functions ( see figs.[histop1 ] and [ histop2 ] ) @xmath43 with @xmath44 where @xmath45 are normalization constants . using these fittings we can see in fig .",
    "[ histop3 ] that the characteristic time scales of both peaks increases as @xmath41 decreases .",
    "these fittings also allowed us to estimate the averages @xmath46 , @xmath47 , associated with each process .",
    "both averages increase with @xmath42 , so we can use finite size scaling analysis to determine the nature of the associated processes .",
    "suppose that the relaxation is completely governed by a competition between ground state domains , that is , by a curvature driven relaxation of the domain walls .",
    "the excess of energy respect to the ground state is given by @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the `` surface '' tension per unit length of the domain walls and @xmath50 the fraction of spins belonging to them ; @xmath50 is approximately given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the average number of domains , @xmath53 is the average linear size of the domains and @xmath54 is a geometrical factor . using @xmath55 and grouping all these factors we get @xmath56 . for @xmath13",
    "the energy distribution of the striped phase is very narrow and lies very near the ground state , so the criterium @xmath39 implies @xmath57 , condition that is attained when @xmath58 .",
    "since for a heat bath dynamics with non - conserved order parameter ( class a system ) we can assume @xmath59 we expect the scaling @xmath60 .",
    "we verified that @xmath61 for a wide range of values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( see an example in fig.[tau1 ] ) , thus confirming that @xmath62 is associated with a simple coarsening process .",
    "now suppose that relaxation is governed by an homogeneous nucleation process . according to classical nucleation theory @xmath63 follows approximately an arrhenius law @xmath64 , @xmath65 being the height of the free energy barrier to nucleation . in a finite two  dimensional system",
    "@xcite @xmath66 , @xmath67 being the melting temperature ; in our case @xmath68 . in an infinite system below the melting point , classical nucleation theory predicts that @xmath69 is given by the excess of free energy of a critical droplet with average linear size @xmath70 of the ordered ( striped ) phase inside the disordered ( nematic ) metastable state .",
    "thus , if @xmath71 the free energy barrier is expected to be almost independent of the system size when @xmath72 .",
    "but , if @xmath73 , the droplet never reaches the critical size and the excess of free energy is dominated by surface tension . hence",
    ", the transition to the crystal phase will occur when the crystal droplet reaches the system size and therefore we expect @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "fig.[tau2 ] shows that @xmath76 follows such scaling , suggesting its identification with the average nucleation time @xmath77 .",
    "however , due to the procedure we used to obtain it , @xmath76 actually corresponds to the crystallization time , which is not necessarily equal to @xmath77 , because after the creation of a critical droplet it follows a growth process until the whole system reaches the crystal phase ( for the rather small system sizes we considered we can assume that there is only one critical droplet ) .",
    "hence , @xmath78 .",
    "however , we can expect @xmath79 , so @xmath80 , at least as far as @xmath42 is large enough that we are in the scaling regime , but small enough so that the free energy barrier still depends on @xmath42 . under these conditions",
    "@xmath81 give us a good approximation of @xmath77 and we can estimate @xmath82 up to logarithmic corrections . then , by fitting the curves of fig.[tau2 ] using a sigmoidal function @xmath83 ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are fitting parameters ) we can extrapolate @xmath87 . the extrapolated curve @xmath85 is shown in the inset of fig.[tau2 ] .",
    "we see that @xmath85 grows strongly as @xmath88 , while it appears to present a minimum around @xmath89 , or at least to saturate in a constant value as @xmath90 .",
    "this is compatible with the results in @xcite obtained from a different analysis where it was found a divergent free energy barrier at the transition temperature @xmath23 in the thermodynamic limit . for quench temperatures",
    "@xmath91 very large relaxation times make it very difficult to obtain reliable numerical results . for future analysis",
    "we list in table [ tabla1 ] the approximated fitted values of @xmath81 for different values of @xmath42 and @xmath41 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notice the strong dependence of @xmath92 with @xmath42 for the range of sizes here considered . in fig.[corretimel ] we show @xmath92 as a function of @xmath42 for a fixed temperature in the metastable region .",
    "we see that @xmath92 becomes independent of @xmath42 for sizes larger than @xmath93 , which coincides with the crossover value observed for the plateau , suggesting the same origin for both finite size effects .",
    "the main result of this work is the observation of interplay between nucleation and coarsening which appears to be a novel feature . in other words",
    ", coarsening happens usually as a competition between domains of different _ stable _ phases . in the present case both direct coarsening of the stripe phase and nucleation of the same phase on a nematic background can happen with a probability that depends on the final temperature .",
    "nucleation processes are associated with a strong metastability of the nematic phase .",
    "if the final temperature @xmath94 is not too far below the stripe - nematic transition temperature the probability of nucleation is high : during the quench the system initially relaxes to the nematic phase , which is metastable below @xmath23 until finally it decays through nucleation to the equilibrium stripe phase . for final temperatures",
    "deep in the stripe phase simple coarsening processes between stripe states with different orientation have larger probability of occurrence than nucleation .",
    "although no detailed theory is available for predicting this behavior in the whole temperature range , classical arguments assuming homogeneous nucleation , coarsening with a non - conserved order parameter and finite size scaling give a reasonably good interpretation of all the observed phenomenology .",
    "the origin of this interplay may rely in the fact that the stable and the metastable phases share the same orientational symmetry , so we can have domains with stripes ( or pieces of stripes ) that can be oriented along the same directions of the square lattice substrate in both phases .",
    "quasi - equilibrium autocorrelations in the stable and metastable nematic regions show a plateau whose nature is not completely clear . for temperatures where the nematic phase is only metastable , this plateau appears in a finite time window until a final decay for times @xmath95 . for temperatures in the equilibrium nematic phase",
    "the behavior is more subtle .",
    "although in a first approximation one could consider it to be a distinct characteristic of the nematic phase , in which a fraction of the spins remain practically frozen , we got indications that for the larger sizes the height of the plateau begins to diminish , signalling a possible finite size origin .",
    "one possibility is that the fraction of frozen spins in the nematic phase diminish with system size , in which case the plateau will eventually disappear for sizes large enough .",
    "more work is needed to clarify the behavior of equilibrium relaxations in large samples .",
    "the present results also confirm the existence of the intermediate nematic phase , as observed in equilibrium simulations in @xcite ; all the dynamical observations are in agreement with the reported equilibrium results .",
    "in fact , a nematic phase with quasi - long - range order is expected to be generic in isotropic systems with competing interactions  @xcite .",
    "recent analytic results on a continous version of the present system show the presence of an isotropic - nematic transition which is in the kosterlitz - thouless universality class , while the stripe phase with true positional long range order turns out to be unstable for continous and isotropic systems in @xmath96  @xcite in the thermodynamic limit , at variance with the discrete model studied here .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to note that , although truly unstable in the thermodynamic limit , stripe domains grow already in the paramagnetic phase with decreasing temperature  @xcite and may be relevant for observations in finte size systems , like in simulations for example . in the present case , the stability of the low temperature stripe phase may be due to the symmetry breaking effect of the lattice and the sharp nature of the ising domain walls . a unified interpretation of the nature of the transitions in the discrete and continous models is still lacking .    a final important point concerns the strong increase observed in the stationary relaxation time @xmath92 in the metastable nematic phase .",
    "although a spinodal instability can not be excluded , the stretched exponential relaxation and the super arrhenius behavior of @xmath97 point to an increasing cooperative and glassy behaviour of the dynamics . indeed , a very similar behavior in a related model , namely the coulomb frustrated model in 3d , has been interpreted as an evidence of fragile glass forming phenomenology@xcite .",
    "recent experimental results on fe on cu(100 ) ultrathin films@xcite have suggested the possibility of a stripe - liquid to stripe - glass transition in the vicinity of the stripe ordering temperature .",
    "stripe - glassy behaviour can be interpreted within the frustration limited domain theory  @xcite or the random first order transition  @xcite scenarios .",
    "we have not attempted a quantitative comparison with either theory , which remains as subject of future work .",
