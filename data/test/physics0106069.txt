    "a wide variety of types of volcanic activity exists : from devastating explosions separated by calm periods of many years or even centuries to a steady continuous outpouring of magma . in this paper",
    "we study mechanisms that give rise to a strombolian - type volcanic activity , which is somewhere between these two extremes and characterized by regularly repeated explosions ( 10 - 400 per day ) followed by relatively calm periods .",
    "often in the course of a longer explosion , the gas and ash emission exhibits audible and visible modulations with a rather robust period of about 1 second .",
    "these modulations , often found on the seismograms of strombolian - type eruptions , received a special name , `` chugging '' ( benoit and mcnutt , 1997 ) , because they resemble a periodic noise produced by a steam engine .",
    "an example of a volcano exhibiting such activity , we consider karymsky volcano on kamchatka peninsula in the far east of russia .",
    "we believe that these strombolian - type eruption patterns are caused by peculiarities of the motion of the magma column , and propose a model that describes the magma motion in a volcanic conduit as a creep flow of viscoelastic compressible medium with shear - stress - dependent boundary conditions .",
    "we show that the dynamics of the model indeed exhibits 2 levels of quasiperiodic behavior and resembles the eruption patterns of the strombolian - type volcanos both on long and short time scales .",
    "the physical transparency of the suggested model allows us to express the observed time scales using the material properties of the magma .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way : first , we briefly describe geological aspects of the current eruption of karymsky volcano .",
    "then , after referring to the existing explanations of strombolian - type activity , the model is formally introduced .",
    "we derive simple analytical expressions for a dormant time , a duration of explosion , and a typical period of tremor , and then present a numerical solution to a system of dynamical equations describing the motion of the magma column .",
    "the paper is concluded with a discussion of results and possible directions for further studies .",
    "karymsky volcano .    karymsky volcano ( fig .  1 ) ,",
    "located in the central part of the east kamchatka volcanic belt , is one of the most active volcanoes in the far - eastern russia .",
    "it is a typical andesite stratovolcano composed of a @xmath0-year old caldera @xmath1  km in diameter ( ivanov et al . , 1991 ) and a more recent cone which started growing about @xmath2 years ago and at present ( september 2000 ) is @xmath3  m high .",
    "the cone is composed of accumulated lava and pyroclastic materials , and the summit of the cone is capped by a double crater . the active part of the crater , formed during the most recent eruption , widened from 90  m in 1996 to 190  m in 2000 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the absolute height of the volcano is 1549  m.     double summit crater at karymsky volcano .",
    "karymsky activity usually consists of long effusive - explosive eruptions , with the eruption previous to the one being studied taking place in 1970 - 1982 .",
    "the current eruption at karymsky volcano began in january 1996 and apparently entered a lull phase in december 2000 .",
    "each eruption consists mostly of the discrete quasiperiodic gas and ash bursts sending plumes 100 - 1000  m above the crater rim ( fig .",
    "gas and ash plums at karymsky volcano .",
    "ash and steam clouds have been observed extending downwind for 10 - 50  km , rarely 100 - 200  km .",
    "a lava flow field , produced by the very viscous magma , runs down the south - western slope of the cone and reaches the length of @xmath4  km and the width @xmath5  m. even during the periods of highest activity , the motion of the lava flows was very slow ( few meters per day ) and was noticeable only by periodic rock - falls , happening every 5 - 15 minutes .    during particularly strong explosions ,",
    "the eruptive column collapsed causing pyroclastic flows .",
    "in the lower part of the eruptive column , hot volcanic bombs of the sizes up to 2 , rarely 5  m , were frequently observed .",
    "the bombs were dense and often covered with a bread - crust - like structure formed during cooling . on the surface of some bombs ,",
    "noticeable extrusive tracks were found ; they were scratched on the very viscous moving magma by the protruding parts of the magma channel .",
    "total volumes of pyroclastic and effusive materials deposited on the cone of karymsky during the eruption of 1996 - 2000 is estimated to be 0.0274 and 0.0229 km@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "eruptive products , which include magma , volcanic bombs , and ash , predominantly consist of andesite , usually of black and dark grey color .",
    "the most common mineral in the eruptive products is plagioclase ( 20 - 25  % ) . crystals of plagioclase can reach a size of 3 - 5  mm .",
    "the concentration of olivine and pyroxene is less than 1% , their crystal sizes are usually 2 - 3  mm . a chemical content of the andesite , averaged over 6 samples from the 1996 - 2000 eruption , is listed below : @xmath7  61.54 , @xmath8  0.86 , @xmath9  16.67 , @xmath10  2.43 , @xmath11  5.12 , @xmath12  0.11 , @xmath13  1.99 , @xmath14  5.31 , @xmath15  3.69 , @xmath16  1.58 , @xmath17  0.25 .",
    "the feeding system of karymsky volcano was studied by various methods , including gravity surveys , aeromagnetic surveys , photogrammetry , seismology and geodesy ( zubin , 1971 ; maguskin , 1982 ; shirokov , 1988 ) . despite slight discrepancies in the estimates of the depth of the upper border of magma chamber and its size , these data agree that underneath the karymsky volcano in the close proximity to the surface there exists a spherical magma chamber .",
    "the upper border of this chamber is in few kilometers below the sea level .",
    "the diameter of the magma chamber is estimated to be between 1.5 and 7  km . a magma channel of a diameter of 100 - 200  m leads from the magma chamber to the top crater .",
    "a distinctive feature of karymsky eruptions is its rather robust periodicity which is observed on two timescales .",
    "an explosion , and a following quiet period , define the first period of activity which varied between 3 and 20 minutes and sometimes extending up to an hour .",
    "an explosion itself can start either abruptly or gradually ( fig .  4 ) and proceed according to one of the following scenarios :     typical acoustic signal of a period of activity of karymsky volcano    during shorter explosions , the activity decays quickly and monotonously ( in less than 10 seconds ) , while the longer explosions ( @xmath18 s , rarely 1 minute ) may contain periods of relatively high and low activity . often during longer ( @xmath19s ) explosions",
    ", the intensity of the acoustic and seismic signals emitted by the volcano exhibits chugging , i.e. modulations with a typical period of @xmath20 second .",
    "the chugging defines the second , shorter , period in the cyclic activity of the volcano .",
    "a typical chugging event consists of 10 - 20 cycles ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the explosion is followed by a quiet period characterized by a complete lack of any activity in the crater and usually lasting much longer than the explosions themselves .",
    "similar temporal patterns have been also observed during previous karymsky eruptions .",
    "( tokarev and firstov , 1967 ; farberov et al . , 1983 ) .",
    "the systematic seismic and acoustic studies of karymsky volcano were conducted in 1997 - 1999 by 3 russian - us expeditions .",
    "the seismograms presented in fig .  4 were recorded in 1998 by a three - component wide - band seismometers cmg 40-t , but the most detailed information about a fine structure of the chugging signal was obtained using a set of infrasound microphones . for a more complete description of the seismic and infrasound recordings at karymsky",
    "the reader is referred to ( johnson et al . , 1998 ; johnson , 2000 ; johnson and lees , 2000 ) .",
    "currently there is no single well - established view on the mechanism causing periodic patterns in the eruptions of strombolian type .",
    "below we mention several possible explanations of origins of the periodicity .",
    "lees and bolton ( 1998 ) compared the eruption process to the steam exhaust from a hydrodynamic system with a nonlinearly controlled exhaust valve resembling a pressure cooker .",
    "manga ( 1996 ) suggested that the periodicity is caused by a segregation of ascending bubbles into waves , as in a pint of guiness beer .",
    "julian ( 1994 ) proposed a mechanism of nonlinear hydrodynamic oscillations in the ascending magma flow .",
    "jaupart and vergniolle ( 1989 ) suggested that oscillations are caused by periodical collapse of a bubble foam trapped in pockets of the magma chamber .",
    "recently , there appeared a paper by delinger and hoblit ( 1999 ) where an _ ad hoc _ hysteresis model was developed to describe a periodic behavior of silicic volcanos .",
    "however , self - consistent explanation for both long- and short - time periodicity and extended calm periods in the activity of strombolian - type volcanoes is still missing . our model , based on viscoelastic hydrodynamical description of the motion of the magma column with shear stress - dependent boundary conditions , accounts for both timescales .",
    "let us first qualitatively discuss the motion of magma in the conduit . since the temperature and pressure in the magma column decrease with the height , the viscosity of magma increases rapidly in the upper part of the conduit .",
    "inspecting eruption products ejected to the surface , it is natural to deduce that at the very top of the column the magma is almost solid .",
    "however , deeper parts of the magma column are still hot and much less viscous . given this significant difference in rheological properties of the upper and lower sections of the magma column , we consider the moving magma as consisting of two distinct parts : long lower part ( lp ) and short upper part ( up ) .",
    "we assume that the viscosity of the magma in the lp is negligible . due to the large amount of dissolved gases , magma in the lp",
    "is compressible .",
    "we also assume that there is a constant supply of fresh magma to the bottom of the lp .",
    "unlike the lp , magma in the up is cold and viscous ; in addition to that , as any media near the liquid - solid transition point , it possesses a certain degree of elasticity .",
    "because of the small length of the up compared to the lp ( @xmath21  m vs. @xmath1  km ) , we can neglect compressibility of the up . in summary , we consider a long cylindrical tube filled with a non - viscous compressible media , fed to the bottom with a constant velocity and a short viscoelastic plug ( up ) on the top .",
    "the boundary conditions for the moving up are controlled by a local value of a shear stress in the vicinity of the cylinder wall .",
    "when the boundary shear stress is low , the plug `` sticks '' to the cylinder wall and the boundary velocity is zero . as the shear stress increases , the magma near the wall undergoes phase transition ( melts ) to a much less viscous liquid state , and the boundary layer of the plug slips along the walls of the channel .",
    "this shear - induced phase transition happens when the viscoelastic state with the non - zero shear modulus becomes thermodynamically less stable than a pure liquid state with zero shear modulus .",
    "phenomenologically , the transition between stick and slip boundary conditions for the very viscous body is similar to the effect of dry friction , where a motion begins only when a driving force exceeds some threshold value ( persson , 1999 , ch .",
    "qualitatively , a cycle of the system evolution can be described as follows : when the pressure in the compressible lp of the column is low , the shear stress @xmath22 in the plug is much smaller than the threshold phase transition value @xmath23 , and the velocity of the up is much less than the feeding velocity @xmath24 .",
    "the difference in feeding and plug velocities results in the growth of the pressure of the compressible magma in lp which , in its turn , increases the shear stress in the plug .",
    "this stage corresponds to the dormant period between explosions .",
    "when the shear stress in the boundary layer of the up exceeds the critical value @xmath23 , the stick - slip phase transition occurs and the plug begins to move .",
    "this corresponds to the appearance of visible signs of a volcanic explosion .",
    "depending on the parameters of the model , the further evolution of the system proceeds according to one of the following two scenarios . for certain conditions ,",
    "a relaxation of the accumulated in the up viscoelastic deformations can result in a low , or even reverse , velocity of the boundary layers of the up relative to the walls of the conduit .",
    "if these conditions persist for sufficient time , they can cause a drop of the shear stress below the slip - stick transition critical value @xmath25 , which in turn can give rise to the reverse , slip - stick transition .",
    "however , the stick state will be very short - lived , since the accumulated excessive pressure in the lp and oscillatory motion of up will result in the immediate increase of the boundary shear stress and a new stick - slip transition .",
    "length of a period of such coupled viscoelastic - stick - slip process is controlled by the density , the elastic modulus , and the characteristic time of the phase transition .",
    "in the second scenario , sticking does not occur during short - periodic viscoelastic oscillations of the up , and the period of these oscillations is roughly equal to that of a freely oscillating elastic membrane with mixed boundary conditions .",
    "either of these oscillation processes can cause the short - period modulation of the activity of the volcano . during the active phase ,",
    "the velocity of the up is much higher than the feeding velocity @xmath24 which results in an expansion of the lp and a decrease of pressure under the up .",
    "when the pressure under the up drops so that the shear stress in the up is below the slip - stick threshold value @xmath25 , a `` long - term '' sticking of the plug occurs , and the system enters a new quiet period of evolution . because of the hysteresis ( @xmath26 ) associated with the first order nature of the stick - slip transition , it takes some time to build enough pressure for a new explosion to begin .",
    "this cycle corresponds to the second , longer period ( 10 - 30 minutes ) in the dynamics of eruption .",
    "although simple in nature , this model qualitatively explains both scales of periodicity of karymsky volcano and does not contradict to the observations .",
    "below a formal analysis of the dynamics of the model is presented .",
    "let us consider a cylinder ( lp ) of the radius @xmath27 and the length @xmath28 , filled with an ideal non - viscous compressible medium feeded from the bottom with a constant velocity @xmath24 .",
    "the top of lp ends with a short viscoelastic plug ( up ) of length @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "sketch of the magma conduit .",
    "the velocity field in the up , of density @xmath31 and driven by pressure @xmath32 and stress tensor @xmath33 , is described by the navier - stokes equation , @xmath34 because of the high viscosity and the low velocity of magma in the up , the nonlinear ( convective ) term is omitted . to account for the viscoelastic properties of the up we use the simple linear maxwell model ( see , for example , shore et al . ) , with a characteristic memory time @xmath35 , @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the dynamic viscosity , and @xmath38 is the shear rate tensor .",
    "incompressibility condition for the magma in the up reads : @xmath39    for simplicity , we assume that the motion of the plug is axially symmetric and select the @xmath40 direction of our cylindrical coordinate system parallel the axis of the cylinder directed along the magma flow .",
    "also , we also consider the pressure gradient constant through the up and being equal to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a pressure at the bottom of the up . using ( [ m],[uc ] ) , the navier - stokes equation ( [ ns ] ) for @xmath43 ( @xmath40-component of the velocity of the plug averaged over the plug length ) can be transformed to : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the radial part of the laplacian operator in the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "from the conservation of mass of the compressible media in the lp , it follows for the pressure @xmath42 on the bottom surface of the up , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the compressibility ( isothermal ) of the media in the lp , and @xmath48 is the velocity of the up @xmath49 , averaged over the perpendicular crossection .    to complete the description of the dynamics of the system , the equations ( [ v],[p ] ) must be complemented by boundary conditions for the velocity on the conduit walls , @xmath50 .",
    "these boundary conditions are controlled by the kinetics of the first - order phase transition driven by the value of the shear stress @xmath51 near the wall and are written in a general mixed form : @xmath52 the quantity @xmath53 is usually called a `` slipping length '' .",
    "it shows at what distance inside the wall the linearly extrapolated velocity becomes equal to zero .",
    "for @xmath54 the boundary conditions for the velocity are `` stick '' , i.e. @xmath55 ; for @xmath56 the boundary layers of the up `` slip '' along the walls of the cylinder with some finite velocity , @xmath57 .",
    "the time evolution of the dimensionless slipping length @xmath58 is determined from the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation , which describes relaxation of a system with a first - order phase transition : @xmath59 where @xmath60 sets a phase transition timescale .",
    "the free energy @xmath61 is a usual double - well potential with a tilt depending on the value of the shear stress @xmath62 on the boundary of the up .",
    "we choose a double - parabola potential which has fixed positions of both minima , @xmath63 and @xmath64 : @xmath65 here @xmath66 is a tilt parameter ; matching point @xmath67 is determined from continuity requirement , @xmath68 . to determine @xmath66 and to illustrate how eqs .",

    "however , large separation of characteristic timescales allows us to give reasonable analytical estimates of important temporal features of the model .",

    "<S> a model is proposed to explain temporal patterns of activity in a class of periodically exploding strombolian - type volcanos . </S>",
    "<S> these patterns include major events ( explosions ) which follow each other every 10 - 30 minutes and subsequent tremor with a typical period of 1 second . </S>",
    "<S> this two - periodic activity is thought to be caused by two distinct mechanisms of accumulation of the elastic energy in the moving magma column : compressibility of the magma in the lower conduit and viscoelastic response of the almost solid magma plug on the top . </S>",
    "<S> a release of the elastic energy happens when a stick - slip dynamic phase transition in a boundary layer along the walls of the conduit occurs ; this phase transition is driven by the shear stress accumulated in the boundary layer . </S>",
    "<S> the first - order character and intrinsic hysteresis of this phase transition explains the long periods of inactivity in the explosion cycle . </S>",
    "<S> temporal characteristics of the model are found to be qualitatively similar to the acoustic and seismic signals recorded at karymsky volcano in kamchatka .    </S>",
