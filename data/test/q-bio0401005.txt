    "nervous system is continuously confronted by megabytes of information , representing light , sound , smell , etc .",
    "this information is compiled by the brain into a set of decisions , representing behaviors of living organisms .",
    "the mechanisms involved in this reduction have been under investigation for many years ( glimcher , 2003 ; romo and salinas , 2003 ) . in this study",
    "we address a question complimentary to the issue of decision making ( dm ) mechanisms .",
    "we define neuronal units involved in making perceptual decisions . for this purpose",
    "we determine dm activity in surrogate networks , defined mathematically , in which a complete control is present over stimuli , mechanisms , and responses .",
    "such decision making analysis ( dma ) has practical significance , since once units involved in making particular decision are located , further efforts could be concentrated on uncovering the underlying mechanisms .    in this study",
    "dm task is defined as evaluation of a function in the multidimensional stimulus space ( figure 1a ) .",
    "this function has a discrete set of values , representing the repertoire of responses available to the organism .",
    "the decisions may , of course , be stochastic , to reflect the uncertainty , pertinent to behavior .",
    "this definition is suitable for experiments where subjects perform poly - alternative forced - choice tasks , such as saccadic response to the direction of stimulus motion ( shadlen and newsome , 2001 ) .",
    "let us consider motion - discrimination task in more detail .",
    "figure 1b lists some visual areas , which are involved in this task .",
    "the areas are arranged along a rough sensory - motor axis , so that the areas on the left are more `` sensory '' , while those on the right are more `` motor '' .",
    "this implies that the responses in these areas are more correlated with stimulus or response respectively .",
    "where on this sensory - motor axis one should position the dm elements ? one could argue that the elements most correlated with the decision itself are the decision makers , following the analogy with the definition of sensory and motor elements .",
    "it is , however , difficult , if not impossible , to distinguish such definition from the definition of purely motor units ( shadlen and newsome , 2001 ) . the latter relay the results of decision making process , without involvement in the formation of the decision .",
    "an alternative approach is therefore needed to define the dm units .",
    "the dm components may be surmised to be located on the interface between sensory and motor areas .",
    "more precisely , the _ first _ element in the sensory - motor chain , which carries significant correlation with the response , may be identified as the decision maker . in this study",
    "we develop this idea into rigorous mathematical formulation and find a special correlation function , which determines contributions of units to dm .",
    "this formalism allows us to answer two questions pertaining to the identities of dm units .",
    "first , we consider the case when not one but _ several _ elements are involved in the same decision simultaneously .",
    "our approach allows us to evaluate relative importance of various units in such a distributed dm .",
    "second , we consider the systems with loops in connectivity . for such systems",
    "the concept of ` the first element ' becomes more arbitrary and one has to proceed more carefully in defining contributions to dm .",
    "we succeed in doing so for our surrogate networks and define dm units for recurrent networks in a way , which is consistent with the linear sensory - motor chains , thus satisfying the requirement of the correspondence principle .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first analyze simple linear chain models , and networks , such as trees , which have similar properties .",
    "we then use this analysis to define decision makers in networks of arbitrary connectivity .",
    "finally , we extend our study to the cases , when electric stimulation can be applied to units , and show that dm components can be identified in a way consistent with our preceeding analyses .",
    "the goal of this section is to formulate quantitative principles by which dm network elements can be identified .",
    "we approach this task by analyzing simple cases , which can be solved exactly without the use of computer , and in which the identities of dm elements are clear .",
    "these cases allow us to emphasize the properties of dm task we are attempting to describe .",
    "we proceed therefore to the analysis of the simplest network capable of making decisions .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the network , which we call ` nematode ' , because of its resemblance to simple biological organisms , both in the layout and in the fundamental significance .",
    "we first define the model ; then show that it can make simple decisions ; and , finally , define the positions of decision makers in the network .",
    "consider a linear chain of units , whose response is characterized by a set of real numbers @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the position of the element in the chain ( figure 2 ) .",
    "response of each element does not depend on time .",
    "this model is therefore static .",
    "this assumption is introduced here to simplify the analysis and can be relaxed as described below ( section  [ trees ] ) .",
    "each unit performs a simple linear transformation between the unit s input and the output .",
    "thus , for element number @xmath2 @xmath3 here @xmath4 is noise associated with the element . in this work",
    "we assume that noise has zero mean , is individual to each unit , and , therefore , is uncorrelated between units , i.e. @xmath5 we further assume that noise has a gaussian distribution .",
    "the chain of linear elements is thus completely specified by a set of noise variances @xmath6 .",
    "the model described by ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) yields the following solution for the response of the last element in the chain @xmath7 thus , the response of the last element is just a sum of the input into network @xmath8 and noise contributions from all units , independently on the order of unit in the chain .",
    "the last element in the chain has non - linear response properties .",
    "its response is defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the heaviside  step  function , which is equal to one / zero if the argument is positive / negative .",
    "it follows then that our ` nematode ' network is capable of making decisions based on the values of input variable @xmath8 .",
    "this is if we interpret variable @xmath11 , which is equal either 0 or 1 , as the result of dm process , as defined in figure 1a .",
    "the decisions are made stochastically and are dependent upon the instantiations of random variables @xmath4 , which vary from trial to trial .",
    "our model is completely defined by the set of noise variances , pertinent to each unit @xmath12 .",
    "although decisions made by this chain are quite simple , the identities of decision makers are not so easy to find .",
    "the distribution of impact to dm along the chain should depend upon the distribution of noise variables @xmath6 .",
    "our next goal is to develop a sensible definition of contributions to dm based on the vector of variances @xmath6 . before doing",
    "so we describe general input - output properties of the chain .    since decision made by the network varies from trial to trial , one can define averaged over trials response of the system @xmath13 .",
    "as shown in figure 2b it has a sigmoid shape , smeared by the total amount of noise in the system .",
    "one can , therefore , consider two cases , depending on whether the signal - to - noise ratio for the chain is large or small .",
    "these two regimes are shown in figure 3a and b respectively .    to analyze responses of units in these two cases",
    "we define their correlation with the decision .",
    "this correlation is defined for each element in the chain ( figure 3 , right ) . as a measure of correlation",
    "we choose mutual information ( mi ) between response of the @xmath14th unit , @xmath15 , and the decision , @xmath11 .",
    "mi has an advantage of being unitless ( it is measured in bits ) and having clear intuitive properties , as described below",
    ". we will also show below in this section that mi has limitations as a measure of dm .",
    "mi describes the information transmission from the @xmath14th unit to the output of the system . since the output can only have values 0 or 1",
    ", mi can not exceed the value of one bit .",
    "we now consider two cases , depending on the network s signal - to - noise ratio . if network input @xmath16 is large , as in figure 3a , response of the system is well correlated with the input .",
    "hence , activities of all units are well correlated with both input and output , and @xmath17 for all of the units . in the opposite limit , when the signal - to - noise ratio is small",
    ", @xmath16 is smaller than noise , and the system s response is weakly correlated with the input ( figure 3b ) . in this case mi as a function of unit s position displays a structure , shown in figure 3b ( right ) .",
    "this structure , as shown below , has a key to the definition of dm components and is qualitatively discussed here .",
    "the units , which are close to the exit from the network , show strong correlation with the decision , similarly to the high signal - to - noise ratio case .",
    "their mi is therefore close to 1 bit . on the other hand , more ` sensory ' units , in the beginning of the chain",
    "are strongly correlated with the input . since",
    "input - output correlation is weak in low signal - to - noise ratio case , the ` sensory ' units display virtually _ no _ relation to the output and @xmath18 for such units ( figure 3b , right ) .",
    "thus , mi , as a function of @xmath2 displays a transition from 0 to 1 in the low signal - to - noise ratio case .    how could one deduce identities of decision makers from these dependencies ( figure 3a and b )",
    "? one could suggest that the elements perfectly correlated with the output of the system , such as exit elements from the chain , are the ones that make the decision",
    ". however , such elements may be just the relay or ` motor ' units , in which case their contribution to dm is small .",
    "indeed , when we type , our decisions are perfectly correlated with activities of finger muscles ; but one could hardly blame our fingers for the content of the typing .",
    "thus , despite their high correlation with the output , exit elements could not be called decision makers .",
    "input elements , having no correlation with the decision , are responsible for dm in even lesser degree .",
    "we thus need to analyze the dependence of mi on position in more detail and suggest another scheme for defining dm units .",
    "our discarding of motor units as decision makers can be further extended onto the entire high signal - to - noise ratio case ( figure 3a ) .",
    "we suggest that the deterministic regime is not descriptive from the point of view of dm analysis .",
    "first , in this regime all units become indistinguishable from motor .",
    "the latter are not decision makers , as suggested above .",
    "second , the dependence shown in figure 3a ( right ) does not reveal the contributions of individual units to the decision .",
    "since all units have the same correlation , it is hard , if not impossible , to differentiate them and assign different contributions .",
    "third , the responses of units in this case are deterministically related to the input .",
    "hence , units act as relays , passively transmitting information along the chain .",
    "it can be argued that the external environment , providing the input variable @xmath8 , acts as the decision maker .",
    "we conclude that to find decision making activity one has to concentrate on the low signal - to - noise ratio case .",
    "we show below that the identities of decision making units can be deduced from the shape of transition in figure 3b ( right ) . to this end",
    "we analyze a set of examples of networks with various distributions of noise @xmath19 .",
    "we start from the simplest example of a single noisy unit .",
    "consider a chain in which noise is absent from all units but one , whose order number in the chain is @xmath20 ( figure 4 ) . since , according to our previous discussion , we need to consider the low signal - to - noise ratio case , we will assume that @xmath21 i.e. network receives no input .",
    "making the decision in this case is still possible , based on the values of noise inside the network . since noise is only present in one neuron , from ( [ eq3 ] ) we conclude that @xmath22 the decision made by the network is @xmath23 thus , decision is causally linked to the processes controlling unit number @xmath20 , which leads us to conclusion that this neuron is the decision maker .",
    "paradoxically , the noisiest unit in this simple formulation makes the largest impact .",
    "all noiseless elements , even nonlinear , are deterministic , and work as simple relays which transmit information from the previous node to the next one .",
    "the output of the circuit is linked to the processes controlling noise in neuron number @xmath20 , rather that in any other neuron in the network .",
    "one would be tempted to conclude that the non - linear element is actually the decision maker in this case .",
    "we deduce that the non - linear element does not have a causal effect on output from the circuit ; therefore its role is just to relay response from neuron @xmath20 to the output . in this respect",
    "the non - linear element is not different from other noiseless elements .    to link this example to our previous discussion ( figure 3b ) we plot mi as a function of position in the chain in figure 4 ( top ) .",
    "as we discussed , mi is high for exit ( ` motor ' ) units and low for input ( ` sensory ' ) elements .",
    "figure 4 also shows the derivative of mi with respect to position in the chain .",
    "it is clear that this derivative represents the decision making element .",
    "thus , we conclude that not correlation with the decision but the _ rate of change _ of the latter along the network is the indicator of dm .",
    "our next example shows that the conclusion about derivative of mi is basically correct , but has to be slightly amended to be numerically precise .",
    "consider the chain in which all elements are noisy and the variance of noise is the same for each element . in this case",
    "@xmath24 i.e. all units contribute to decision _",
    "equally_. this is because eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) does not distinguish the order in which contributions from the units are added , and all contributions are of equal strength on average .",
    "can this conclusion be confirmed by the derivative of mi ?",
    "figure 5a shows mi as a function of position in the chain for this case .",
    "this dependence is obtained in appendix a. it increases smoothly from 0 to 1 resulting in a non - zero derivative at all units .",
    "this is consistent with ( [ eq8 ] ) and the notion that all units participate in the decision .",
    "however , ( [ eq8 ] ) suggests that all units participate in decision _ equally_. the derivative of mi turns out to be slightly non - uniform , as seen in figure 5a .",
    "this can be corrected if not mi itself but a non - linear function of mi , denoted @xmath25 , is considered .",
    "this non - linear function is calculated in appendix a and is shown in figure 5b .",
    "the new correlator @xmath25 has the same basic properties as the mi .",
    "it rises from 0 to 1 monotonously when passing through the array ( figure 5c ) .",
    "but , in addition , its derivative turns out to be _ uniform _ , as shown in figure 5c ( bottom ) .",
    "this is consistent with equal participation of all units in dm in the uniformly distributed noise case and eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that for this case the contributions to dm are given by the rate of increase of @xmath25 when moving through the array @xmath26 here @xmath2 is the index along the chain .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) is the main result of this paper .",
    "it represents our definition of contributions to dm for networks of simple connectivity , such as chains .",
    "three points should be made about the definition ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "first , it reproduces the result obtained in the previous example of noisy neuron .",
    "indeed , the mutual information rises from 0 to 1 on the noisy neuron in figure 4 .",
    "but @xmath25 coincides with mi at these values , as follows from its plot in figure 5b .",
    "thus , the derivative of @xmath25 is also given by a single spike at the position of noisy neuron , as in figure 4 ( bottom ) .",
    "second , eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) implies that , from point of view of dm , not mutual information , but another correlator , given by @xmath25 , is more relevant .",
    "function @xmath27 deviates from linear function only slightly ( figure 5b ) , and for practical purposes the distinction between the mi and @xmath25 could be ignored .",
    "however , we retain it throughout the manuscript to ensure mathematical rigor .",
    "third , when deducing ( [ eq9 ] ) we did not postulate that contributions to dm are proportional to the variance of noise . instead , we suggested that eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) implies that all units contribute equally , independently on the order in the chain .",
    "this simple qualitative statement is powerful enough to constrain our quantitative reasoning and lead to a measure of dm in form of function @xmath25 and definition ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "we do not know yet if the derivative of @xmath25 is proportional to the variance of noise , square root of this variance , or any other characteristic of noise in each element .",
    "all of these parameters give the same results in the uniform noise case .",
    "we need to have a difference between units to measure relative strength of their contributions .",
    "this is achieved by the next example .    , is close to linear , shown by the dotted line .",
    "* c * , the new correlator @xmath25 ( top panel ) has a uniform derivative ( bottom panel ) .",
    "thus , derivative of @xmath25 is a sensible measure of decision making in the case of uniform noise .",
    ", width=288 ]    , is close to linear , shown by the dotted line .",
    "* c * , the new correlator @xmath25 ( top panel ) has a uniform derivative ( bottom panel ) .",
    "thus , derivative of @xmath25 is a sensible measure of decision making in the case of uniform noise .",
    ", width=288 ]      in this example the variances of noise on all neurons are the same , similarly to the previous case .",
    "however , here we amend the network definition given by ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "we do so for only one neuron .",
    "we assume that the link between units 5 and 6 is characterized by a very large strength @xmath28 .",
    "thus , for neuron number 6 ( figure 6 ) instead of ( [ eq1 ] ) we have @xmath29 therefore this example is the same as the previous , except that the single network connection is changed .",
    "what are the dm units in this case ?",
    "the network s output is given by @xmath30 thus , units 1 through 5 contribute equally to decision .",
    "in addition , their contributions are multiplied by a large factor @xmath31 .",
    "units 6 through 11 also contribute equally , but their contribution is much smaller than that of the former group .",
    "we conclude that units 1 through 5 are much stronger decision makers than units 6 through 11 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the derivative of @xmath25 , as shown in figure 6 ( bottom ) .",
    "thus , changing one link in the chain produces large effect on the distribution of dm .",
    "the units downstream from the link contribute less to decisions , while the units upstream contribute a lot . what is the measure of decision making , which could differentiate these two types of units ?",
    "calculations in appendix a show that derivative of @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath32 for units 1 through 5 .",
    "this is easy to understand qualitatively , since mi increases along the chain even for negative ( @xmath33 links .",
    "this is _ not _ possible if contribution from units 1 to 5 are multiplied by @xmath31 for example .",
    "thus , an even power of @xmath31 is required , which is shown in appendix a to be @xmath32 .",
    "so far we have used definition ( [ eq9 ] ) , which is quite complex , since it involves calculation of a nonlinear function @xmath25 .",
    "is it possible to reproduce the results derived above in a simpler way ?",
    "it turns out that the role of given unit in dm is proportional to its contribution to the variability of the output @xmath34 .",
    "this leads us to an alternative to ( [ eq9 ] ) definition of dm .",
    "let us introduce the new definition using the examples , considered above . from ( [ eq11 ] ) in the ` loud ' neuron case we derive @xmath35 we could conjecture that the contributions to dm from different units are weighted proportionally to the corresponding summands in ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "indeed , if we assume @xmath36 @xmath37 by choosing appropriate values of variance of noise and gain , we can reproduce the results of all three of our previous examples .",
    "thus , in the case of noisy neuron the variance of noise is only present in one unit , rendering this unit decision maker , according to ( [ eq13 ] ) . in the case of uniform noise ,",
    "when @xmath38 and all @xmath39 are the same , ( [ eq13 ] ) gives uniform contributions to dm . in the case of ` loud ' neuron , ( [ eq13 ] ) gives the correct factor @xmath32 describing the advantage of upstream neurons .",
    "thus , the contributions to dm are proportional to the variance of noise on given element , multiplied by the square of the gain from this element to the output",
    ". we can rewrite ( [ eq13 ] ) in a more compact form to emphasize this latter statement @xmath40 one could verify ( [ eq14 ] ) , by applying it to ( [ eq12 ] ) and obtaining relationships ( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "this justifies ( [ eq14 ] ) in the three examples considered above .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) also applies to linear chains in general . in appendix",
    "a we derive ( [ eq14 ] ) from previous definition ( [ eq9 ] ) for arbitrary distribution of connection strengths and noise .",
    "thus , ( [ eq14 ] ) can be considered an alternative definition to ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "the equivalence between ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) is demonstrated graphically in figure 7 .",
    "why should one consider an alternative definition ?",
    "this is because ( [ eq9 ] ) can not be applied to networks of arbitrary connectivity , such as circuits containing loops .",
    "definition ( [ eq14 ] ) however applies to all topologies , including the linear chain examples , considered here .",
    "the bottom panel displays the derivative of @xmath25 , defined by ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "the derivative is numerically the same as the variance of noise .",
    "both can be used as measures of decision making .",
    ", width=288 ]      let us review our findings .",
    "first , we arrived to the definition of dm activity using the information - theoretical approach ( [ eq9 ] ) . according to this definition",
    ", dm is the rate of change of correlation with decision along the chain .",
    "in other words , the _ first _ element or elements , which correlate with the decision , are the decision makers .",
    "this approach has its pros and contras .",
    "indeed , the viewpoint expressed by ( [ eq9 ] ) has a potential to be transferred to other systems , which contain non - linear elements .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) has an information - theoretical origin ; hence its applicability may be broader than our simple system .",
    "another advantage of ( [ eq9 ] ) is that it relies on the characteristics measurable in single - electrode recording experiments , such as response of single unit and its correlation with behavioral decision .",
    "thus , ( [ eq9 ] ) could be used experimentally .",
    "the disadvantage of the information - theoretical approach is that it is not clear how to apply it to the systems with loops , as we have mentioned above . since biological networks",
    "almost always contain loops this significantly limits the applicability of information - theoretical formula ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "our second step was to derive an alternative definition ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "the latter is _ equivalent _ to the former definition ( [ eq9 ] ) for linear - chain ( ` nematode ' ) example , as we have demonstrated on simple examples and have shown more rigorously in appendix a. the alternative definition ( [ eq14 ] ) can be understood on the basis of the following two observations .",
    "first , the example of ` noisy ' neuron shows that the variability is the source of decisions .",
    "thus ,    under fixed other conditions , an increase in variability and noise in a single unit leads to a larger contribution to dm from this unit .",
    "@xmath41    second , the example of ` loud ' neuron shows that not only variability and noise are important but also how much of this variability reaches the motor units .",
    "dm is hence a property of network connectivity too .",
    "thus , we arrive to the next rule    the stronger is the pathway from given unit to the motor output , the larger is the contribution of this unit to dm .",
    "@xmath42 these two rules are combined into the definition ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "although ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) assume that the output element is unique , this requirement will be removed below , when we consider arbitrary topology networks .",
    "what are the features of ( [ eq14 ] )",
    "? it could be used for an arbitrary topology network , since it does not contain derivative along the chain , as ( [ eq9 ] ) does .",
    "definition ( [ eq14 ] ) can also be used operationally to measure the contribution of each neuron to the decision experimentally . to do",
    "that one needs to vary noise at the given unit and measure the variability of the responses .",
    "the details are discussed in section  [ stimulation ] below .",
    "a special note should be made about normalization in ( [ eq14 ] ) . throughout this work",
    "we adopt the convention that dm contributions are evaluated for all units and then normalized proportionally to ( [ eq14 ] ) , so that the total sum of all contributions is equal to one ( or 100% ) .",
    "we will assume this to hold below without explicitly mentioning .",
    "finally , we give another definition of dm contributions , which could be useful when noise in the system is the same for all units . in this case",
    "the only difference between units is due to difference in their position in the network .",
    "we therefore call such quantity _ topological _ dm . @xmath43 as seen from e.g. ( [ eq12 ] ) it does not depend on the levels of noise , and can be obtained from ( [ eq14 ] ) by assuming that @xmath44 for all units",
    ". it therefore describes how strongly each elements of the circuit affects the output .",
    "this quantity is sometimes helpful in describing the network s topology .",
    "lastly , we discuss the notion of noise and variability in our approach .",
    "is this really noise , which leads networks to decisions ?",
    "not necessarily .",
    "imagine that we have studied a chain - like network ( figure 8a ) and performed the dm analysis , described above .",
    "we found that the network contains two decision makers , which are equally important .",
    "a more thorough investigation may suggest that these units are inputs from external network , which in effect is responsible for dm .",
    "for example , these hidden pathways may be inputs from other sensory modalities or regulatory inputs of other type .",
    "thus , dma may help identify entry points from other , less studied , parts of the network .",
    "our studies indicate that information - theoretical analysis [ definition ( [ eq9 ] ) ] can be further extended to tree - like topologies ( figure 9 ) . to this end",
    "we define column - vector @xmath45 such that @xmath46 .",
    "then ( [ eq9 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the structure matrix defined as follows .",
    "an element @xmath49 of the structure matrix is equal to 1 if there is a connection from unit number @xmath2 to @xmath50 .",
    "matrix @xmath51 thus implements evaluating differences between connected elements in ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "structure matrix is related to connectivity matrix , containing network s weights through @xmath52 .",
    "connectivity matrices for some networks are shown in figures 9 and 10 .",
    "information - theoretical approach can be even further extended on the cases , when signals propagate along the network in time , therefore resulting in delays between signal and response . in this case by @xmath53 one should understand a sum of correlations over all times preceding the decision .",
    "this compensates for the presence of delays .",
    "so far there is no understanding if eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) [ or ( [ eq9 ] ) ] can be used for topologies other than trees .",
    "definition ( [ eq14 ] ) , however , can be used with networks of arbitrary connectivity .",
    "this is the topic of the next section .",
    "all previous examples , except the one mentioned at the end of the last session , were static , i.e. variables did not depend on time .",
    "the deficiency of this approach is that it is not clear how to treat networks with loops . to apply our analysis to the cases with loops , and , in general , to networks with _ arbitrary _ connectivity ( figure 10 )",
    ", we consider time - dependent models here .",
    "this allows us to observe propagation of noise around the loop explicitly and to make accurate conclusions about contributions to dm .",
    "we limit ourselves to linear dynamical systems , where the single nonlinear element is the last one , transforming an analog system output to a binary response . as the first step we consider temporal dynamics in the discrete - time approximation , which contains all essential features of our approach . later in the section",
    "we extend discrete model to the continuous - time case and show their equivalence .          in this section",
    "we consider a system of @xmath54 elements , whose activity at each instant is described by an @xmath54-dimensional column - vector @xmath55 .",
    "time has discrete values separated by an interval @xmath56 .",
    "therefore this model is called the discrete - time model .",
    "the values of activity at two neighboring time - slices are related by the connection matrix @xmath57 @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the vector describing noise added to activity vector on each time - slice .",
    "the variable @xmath60 describes sensory input into the system .",

    "this assumption can be easily relaxed and is used here to simplify the analysis .",

    "further , if noise is specific to each neuron , the same - time correlation matrix @xmath62 is diagonal @xmath63 this takes place i.e. when stochasticity is induced by probabilistic nature of synaptic vesicle release , in which case every two neurons receive uncorrelated fluctuating inputs .    some time after presentation of the stimulus [ @xmath64 the system is forced to make a decision through the following process",
    "first , a scalar quantity @xmath65 is evaluated . here",
    "time corresponds to the instant , when the choice is to be made .",

    "on the second step , decision is made based on the sign of @xmath68 @xmath69 thus , this model describes a two - alternative forced - choice task .",
    "our system is completely defined by the following set of parameters : @xmath70 , @xmath60 , @xmath62 , and @xmath66 .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , the presence of the stimulus is not required to define dm elements [ eq . ( [ eq5 ] ) ] .",

    "we now are ready to determine dm elements in our simple model .    to find decision makers we will use eq .",

    "the contribution to dm from a given element can be determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) @xmath89 the topological dm contributions are @xmath90 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq28 ] ) and ( [ eq29 ] ) one can analyze a variety of network connectivities . some new effect emerging for non - tree systems",
    "are described next .",
    "we now consider network shown in figure 11a , in which all elements have the same variance of noise and all connections have unitary strength .",
    "figure 11a shows two pathways from unit * 2 * to the exit unit , * 6*. the resulting network gain from unit * 2 * to unit * 6 * is thus equal to two .",
    "all other units gain at the exit is one .",
    "the contribution to dm from unit * 2 * is thus four times larger that from other units .",
    "this is because noise at this unit is multiplied by a factor of two , and the variance of noise , by a factor of four .",
    "we conclude that there may be some special elements in network , which occupy hub - like positions , gaining large influence due to abundance of their outputs .",
    "it should be noted that fan - in hubs are not special from the point of view of dm in any way .",
    "let us now examine the network with a loop .",

    "the presence of loop affects dm drastically : our discrete - time model marks units belonging to the loop as decision makers ) and ( [ eq29 ] ) does not have a valid solution for the loop with all connection equal to unity .",
    "one needs to set one of the connection as a parameter , @xmath91 , solve the equations , and consider the limit @xmath92 .",
    "this is easy to understand , since noise , generated by each unit on each time - step , can not leave the loop and , therefore , builds up there without limits .",

    "? why would one introduce such unreliable components ?",
    "loops , similar to shown in figure 11b , have many useful properties .",
    "for instance , they can act as parametric memory systems .",
    "imagine that responses of all units in the loop have the same values , equal to @xmath94 .",
    "this could be accomplished by manipulating the sensory inputs .",
    "assume that no more inputs are received from the outside of the system .",
    "it follows that , in the absence of noise on each element , this value of response will reverberate around the loop forever .",
    "this is because all links have unitary strength .",
    "loops can thus memorize a graded value , such as @xmath94 , functioning as parametric memory elements .",
    "suppose , in addition , that a non - zero input @xmath95 is applied to element number * 1 * at all times .",
    "since this element acts as a summator , its response on the next step is @xmath96 .",
    "the signal @xmath95 propagates around the loop , and in four steps it reaches the first element again , at which time its response is @xmath97 . in four more steps @xmath98 .",
    "thus , not only noise , but also signal can build up in the system .",
    "therefore , a loop can operate as a temporal integrator .",
    "the integration is not perfect if one of the links has a non - unitary strength , in which case integrator becomes leaky ( robinson , 1989 ) .",
    "temporal integrators play special role in dm , since they act as accumulators of sensory information , which puts them into special position with respect to other areas ( gold and shadlen , 2002 ) . as an example , such is area lip in primate visual cortex , which is involved in dm in direction - discrimination task ( shadlen and newsome , 2001 ; roitman and shadlen , 2002 ; mazurek et al . , 2003 ) .",

    "the latter turn out to be useful for our purposes .",

    "if matrix @xmath100 is symmetric , its eigenvalues are real and eigenvectors are orthogonal .",
    "this leads to a unit gram matrix .",
    "then , eq . ( 3.29 ) becomes more compact @xmath135 similar equations , called kubo formulas , are obtained for various correlators in case of diffusion of particles in random media ( efetov , 1997 ) .",
    "the distinguishing feature of ( [ eq48 ] ) is that a product of four eigenvectors enters the expression .",
    "thus , propagation of noise in this case can be accompanied by interference between different pathways .",
    "an example of destructive interference of this kind is given below , in section [ stimulation ] .",
    "( [ eq48 ] ) can be further simplified .",
    "indeed , our model uses diagonal noise matrices , i.e. @xmath136 in ( [ eq48 ] ) .",
    "suppose also that the output from the network occurs through one exit element number @xmath2 , which is specified by taking @xmath137 . in this case",
    "the use of eq . ( [ eq42 ] ) gives @xmath138 from this equation we conclude that for element @xmath20 to contribute to dm , an eigenvector should exist , which is non - zero on both unit number @xmath20 and exit unit @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we conclude that eigenvectors of @xmath100 should be delocalized for broader impact of elements on the decision .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the mentioned analogy with the diffusion problem . in case",
    "if matrix @xmath100 is not symmetric , the gram matrix may be non - diagonal and ( [ eq49 ] ) can not be used .",
    "however , the off - diagonal elements of @xmath139 are usually smaller than diagonal ones , due to uncorrelated sign changes , when ( [ eq47 ] ) is computed with @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , ( [ eq49 ] ) may apply approximately .",
    "stimulations with electric current add a new degree of freedom to dma , thus leading to more effective ways of finding decision makers .",
    "there are two great advantages of the stimulation method .",
    "first , it only involves stimulation of a single neuron , therefore no simultaneous multiple - electrode measurements are required .",
    "second , the knowledge of network connectivity is not needed to solve the problem . in this section",
    "we study our simple networks and find what stimulation strategies are consistent with our earlier definitions , such as eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "we will use continuous model for concreteness ( section [ continuous ] ) . consider the output variable @xmath68 .",
    "it is a linear function of the inputs .",
    "it is also a function , which contains noise components , variable from trial to trial .",
    "the noise components were acquired from all units in different degree . since noise in each unit is gaussian , the output variable is described by gaussian distribution too @xmath141 in each trial a random value of @xmath68 is obtained , according to distribution ( [ eq50 ] ) .",
    "the response of the system is equal to 1 if @xmath68 is positive , and 0 otherwise .",
    "the probability to obtain response equal to 1 to given stimulus @xmath95 is given by the error function ( abramowitz and stegun , 1972 ) @xmath142,\\ ] ] whereas the probability of zero response is @xmath143.\\ ] ] both probabilities depend upon the mean response to stimulus @xmath144 and the standard deviation @xmath145 . therefore the electric stimulation strategies may be based on affecting either the former or the latter .",
    "we now consider both of these strategies and show that affecting the mean response may provide misleading results , while changing the variance of response allows estimating contributions to dm consistently with our previous definitions .",
    "thus , strategies of stimulation based on standard deviation of the output variable are _ always _ correct in our simple model , independently on the topology of the network .",
    "this may seem a trivial consequence of definition ( [ eq14 ] ) , but we will discuss it here for the sake of comparison of two strategies and optimizing them .",
    "we start with the strategies of stimulation , which affect the mean response @xmath144 . in our simple model",
    "this may be accomplished by injecting a tonic input current into a unit number @xmath2 .",
    "mathematically it is accomplished by adding extra stimulus @xmath146 to this unit in eq .",
    "( [ eq31 ] ) .",
    "note that in biological systems the stimulating current is alternating with constant amplitude ( salzman et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "the mean response is shifted by the stimulation , i.e. @xmath147 where @xmath146 is the magnitude of injected tonic current .",
    "this leads to observable changes in the probability @xmath148 @xmath149 here @xmath150 is the change in probability of correct responses after unit number @xmath2 is electrically stimulated .",
    "can @xmath150 be a measure of dm ?",

    "this depends on the sign of derivative @xmath151 , which is positive for excitatory pathway from unit @xmath2 to the output and negative for inhibitory pathway .",

    "our investigations show that this expression is accurate for trees and is consistent with both our earlier definitions ( [ eq9 ] ) or ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "remarkably , it employs quantities , which can be measured in a single - electrode experiment .",
    "indeed , the amplitude of noise @xmath6 can be found from autocorrelation of unit s response , using ( [ eq44 ] ) ; and @xmath150 is determined from behavioral changes in response to single - unit stimulation .",
    "this equation thus provides an approach potentially useful in practice .",
    "does this relationship work for networks of arbitrary connectivity ?",
    "figure 12b shows a counterexample , in which a unit is stimulated , which results in _ no _ change in probability of correct response ( we consider trials in which 1 is the correct response throughout this section ) .",
    "this is because there are two pathways , leading from this unit to the exit , one positive and one negative .",
    "they have equal strength , and , therefore , compensate each other . on the other hand , unit number one _ does _ participate is dm , because if a non - stationary stimulation / stimulus is applied , its effect on the decision is not zero .",
    "thus , ( [ eq54 ] ) and tonic stimulation method can not be applied to arbitrary circuits , such as shown in figure 12b , to accurately reveal decision makers .    .",
    ", width=288 ]    . ,",
    "width=288 ]    is there a stimulation method for finding decision making components in arbitrary networks ?",
    "the method follows directly from the definition ( [ eq14 ] ) [ or ( [ eq35 ] ) , which is equivalent ] . indeed , when stimulating current is a temporal white noise , the output variable @xmath68 acquires a larger variance ( figure 12c ) .",
    "hence , the derivative of output variance , entering ( [ eq35 ] ) can be calculated operationally , by injecting a distracter current .",
    "more precisely , if the variance of stimulating current applied to unit @xmath2 is @xmath156 the derivative entering definition ( [ eq35 ] ) is @xmath157 in practice one has no access to the variable @xmath68 , so one can not measure directly the change in variance @xmath158 .",
    "instead , one could measure the change in the probability of correct responses under the influence of distracting current .",
    "indeed , from ( [ eq50_5 ] ) we obtain @xmath159 combining the last two equations we obtain for the important derivative @xmath160 since the probability of correct responses always decreases under the influence of distracters , the derivative @xmath161 is a negative constant .",
    "it is the same for all units .",
    "we arrive therefore to the expression for contributions to dm , which follows from ( [ eq35 ] ) @xmath162 here @xmath150 is the decrease in probability of correct responses produced by electric stimulation with variance of the random current equal to @xmath156 .",
    "the variance of noise on each unit @xmath163 can be found from autocorrelation using ( [ eq45 ] ) .",
    "this procedure works for any topology in our simplified model .",
    "it should be noted here that if noise is not entirely white or can not be considered white , ( [ eq45 ] ) can not be used directly and should be replaced by an expression reflecting the spectral characteristics of noise appropriate for the system under investigation .",
    "thus , if noise is provided by other parts of the network , its dynamic features may be more complex .",
    "therefore , ( [ eq45 ] ) may not apply directly to the ` hidden pathway ' example given in the end of section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the procedure , which we just described , permits further optimization .",
    "indeed , imagine that the probability of correct responses is exactly @xmath164 .",
    "adding distracting stimulation current will not change this probability , i.e. @xmath165 no matter what unit is stimulated . in the opposite limiting case when @xmath166 , the effect of distracter on performance is exponentially small .",
    "hence , behavioral response to stimulation has an optimum between @xmath167 and @xmath168 . to find the optimum we observe from ( [ eq56 ] ) that @xmath169 is maximum for the same variation in @xmath170 when @xmath171 is maximum .",
    "we therefore plot the latter derivative as a function of @xmath148 in figure 12d .",
    "we indeed observe a maximum at the value of probability of correct responses close to @xmath172 to summarize , the following scenario describes algorithm for finding contributions to dm using random stimulation .",
    "assume that we _ do not know _ the network connectivity @xmath100 and output metrics vector @xmath66 ; but we know autocorrelation for each unit @xmath127 .",
    "the steps below allow finding the decision makers .    1 .",
    "prepare stimulus so that the probability of correct responses is close to the value given by ( [ eq59 ] ) .",
    "2 .   stimulate one unit with random current , whose variance is @xmath156 , and measure the decrease in probability of correct responses @xmath169 .",
    "3 .   record autocorrelation and evaluate noise variance @xmath6 for this unit using ( [ eq45 ] ) .",
    "4 .   find contribution to dm for this unit using equation ( [ eq58 ] ) .",
    "repeat steps 1 through 4 for all units in the system .",
    "normalize contributions to dm so that @xmath129 .",
    "in this work we defined decision makers in networks , which behave in a well - defined fashion . as with any definition , there is certain degree of arbitrariness in our study , since this is the first mathematical study of this sort .",
    "we had to make choices about the features of decision making we were attempting to describe as well as about the way they were quantified .",
    "we demonstrated these features in a set of examples .",
    "future studies will show if these features can be used as a basis of a more complete model - independent theory .",
    "in this study we postulated that variability and noise , causally linked to decisions , are the chief descriptors of dm .",
    "although this point may seem paradoxical we suggest three arguments in its favor .",
    "first , variability may reflect additional information needed to make a decision in case of uncertainty .",
    "such may be inputs from other modalities , memories , or some other relevant modulatory inputs , supplying e.g. emotional condition of the subject or changing utility values ( figure 8) .",
    "second , many behaviors , such as c - start escape responses in fish ( eaton and emberley , 1991 ) and other organisms ( glimcher , 2003 ) , have stochastic character .",
    "this makes the task of pursuer more difficult .",
    "such unpredictable behaviors are reproduced in our model if the sensory input is weak or in the small signal - to - noise ratio case .",
    "third , the goal of dm is to dissipate sensory information , as suggested in the introduction ( figure 1a ) , whereby an analog multi - dimensional stimulus space is reduced to a discrete space of several decisions .",
    "we argue that this transformation is facilitated by noise .",
    "we have studied the problem of finding decision making units in networks of various connectivities .",
    "this path took us from simple linear chains , for which the information - theoretical ( it ) approach was found to be effective , to trees , and , finally to an alternative definition of decision makers , based on propagation of noise in networks .",
    "this latter definition is valid in networks of arbitrary topology .",
    "all these approaches are equivalent , when they can be compared , but include progressively broader classes of networks . as a practical application for the alternative definition we considered the problem of electric stimulation in the surrogate networks and showed a way of determining dm contributions for arbitrary networks using stimulation with random current .",
    "our findings are summarized in figures 13 and 14 .",
    "although we studied networks of complex connectivity , the model describing a single network element was quite simple .",
    "not all of the units are linear , of course , since dm is a non - linear task ( figure 1a ) . however , our model is essentially based on linear elements .",
    "the motivation for this model is that it is easy to analyze .",
    "the study of simple models is a necessary step before analysis proceeds any further .",
    "once the methodological issues are resolved for simpler models , complex non - linear systems can be studied in the same paradigm .",
    "one of important questions resolved here is that a completely linear element can be a decision maker , despite the presence of non - linear units in the network .",
    "thus , nonlinearity is not a necessary attribute of dm",
    ". this question would be impossible to answer for more realistic system , since in practice all units contain nonlinearities .",
    "decision making task , as formulated in figure 1a , is similar to general object discrimination task .",
    "representation of motor response in our model is not distinguishable mathematically from the representation of abstract object / decision category ( horwitz and newsome , 1998 ; shadlen and newsome , 2001 ) .",
    "the latter does not necessarily lead to a motor command .",
    "thus , our analysis may uncover the identities of units responsible for categorization of sensory inputs . in terms of this analysis",
    "we emphasize the distinction between units representing the object category and the units in which this representation is actually formed .",
    "the former are analogous to motor units in the decision task , while the latter are similar to decision makers .",
    "as follows from this study , the analysis is dependent upon the topology of the network involved . for simple linear sensory chains",
    "our conclusion is that the _ first _ unit , spatially or temporally , in which the representation of the object is correlated with final outcome of the discrimination process , is responsible for casting the stimulus in one of the abstract classes . in case of recurrent networks",
    "a more detailed quantitative analysis is needed to draw conclusions about identities of categorizing units .",
    "thus , dma may find a broader use in identifying units representing abstract object s percepts .",
    "a special care should be taken in distinguishing the dm task from the sensory discrimination task .",
    "it may occur that in the same experiment these tasks are performed by different populations of neurons .",
    "an example is given by ( salinas and romo , 1998 ) .",
    "they discovered a population of m1 neurons responding differentially to two categories of tactile stimuli .",
    "some of these neurons did not respond , when the same behavior was guided by visual cues .",
    "this observation is consistent with these neurons performing sensory discrimination of tactile stimuli , while some other population making decisions about the actual motor response .",
    "our mathematical analysis is general enough to include both of these functions .",
    "thus , if correlations with motor response are studied , it will result in the decision makers ; while when the correlations with percepts are investigated , dma should provide the identities of discriminating elements .",
    "we suggest that dma may be relevant to other biological systems .",
    "possible applications may include the analysis of molecular networks , such as genetic regulatory or protein binding networks ; finding decision makers in compartmental models of dentritic trees ( poirazi and mel , 2001 ) ; studies of neural networks and structural networks of connectivities between different brain areas ; and analysis of social networks .",
    "in this study we define network elements responsible for making decisions .",
    "we obtain two equivalent definitions . according to one ,",
    "decisions are made by elements , in which correlations with the decision are first formed .",
    "according to the second definition , decision making activity is measured by the impact of variability in given unit on the response .",
    "we give examples of network motifs , especially potent from decision making prospective , such as fan - out hubs and recurrent loops .",
    "the latter can function as temporal integrators of sensory inputs .",
    "we also study how electric stimulations can reveal decision making components .",
    "we conclude that stimulations with time - varying random current produce correct results for all network topologies .",
    "here we solve a more general version of linear chain model than considered in the text .",
    "the responses of neighboring neurons are related linearly @xmath173 this is a generalization of ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the response of the @xmath20th unit is @xmath174 where coefficients @xmath175 , @xmath176 .",
    "the external signal @xmath177 is assumed to be zero in this appendix , due to ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "for the last element in the chain we have @xmath178    comparing ( [ eqa2 ] ) and ( [ eqa3 ] ) we conclude that @xmath179 where @xmath180 is a variable , which describes noise in the networks downstream from unit @xmath20 .",
    "it is , thus , uncorrelated with @xmath181 .",
    "this is where tree - like topology enters our solution , since in case of loops , @xmath181 and @xmath180 are correlated .",

    "in this section we show that the discrete - time model can be derived from continuous - time model . starting from equation ( [ eq37 ] ) for the unit responses in the continuous case",
    "we obtain the relation for solutions at two different time points separated by the time - interval @xmath218 , analogous to ( [ eq19 ] ) in the discrete - time description .",
