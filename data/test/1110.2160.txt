    "qcd is expected to undergo a transition to a deconfined state , where thermodynamics can no longer be described by hadronic degrees of freedom but should be described in terms of elementary quark and gluon degrees of freedom . in addition , the chiral symmetry which is broken in qcd vacuum is expected to be restored above some temperature . in the limit of zero quark masses the restoration of the chiral symmetry",
    "is expected to be a true phase transition . however , for the quark masses realized in nature this transition turns out to be an analytic crossover @xcite .",
    "a question naturally arises whether the deconfinement and the chiral transitions are closely related .",
    "early lattice calculations with large quark masses and/or coarse lattices suggested that deconfinement and chiral transition happen at the same temperature @xcite .",
    "however , more recent investigations that use so - called stout staggered quark action and finer lattices found that these two transitions are no longer interconnected @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are going to discuss the deconfinement and chiral transition in qcd at non - zero temperature using highly improved staggered quark ( hisq ) action and tree - level improved gauge action .",
    "we refer to this combination of quark and gauge actions as hisq / tree action . to control discretization effects calculations",
    "have been performed at three values of the lattice spacing corresponding to temporal extent @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to fix the lattice spacing we used the @xmath2 scale of the static quark potential @xcite and the kaon decay constant @xmath3 .",
    "additional calculations using the asqtad action with @xmath4 and @xmath1 have been performed to demonstrate the consistency of the results obtained with different actions , since the asqtad action was extensively used in the past to study qcd at non - zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the breaking of the chiral symmetry in qcd vacuum is signaled by non - zero expectation value of quark condensate @xmath5 . at non - zero temperature",
    "the quark condensate is expected to decrease , signaling the restoration of the chiral symmetry .",
    "however , the quark condensate needs a multiplicative , and for non - zero quark mass , also an additive renormalization . therefore following ref .",
    "@xcite we consider the following quantity , which we will call the renormalized chiral condensate @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 refer to quark condensate at zero and non - zero temperatures , @xmath9 and @xmath10 for light and strange quarks , respectively .",

    "this feature was first noticed for stout action @xcite .",
    "the difference in the stout action and our result is due to the small difference in the light quark mass @xmath14 . in our calculation @xmath15 , while the stout calculations correspond to @xmath16 . here",

    "the deconfinement transition can bee seen as a rapid change between these two limiting behaviors and thus the quark number susceptibilities are expected to show a rapid increase . in fig .",

    "after proper renormalization , the square of the polyakov loop characterizes the long distance behavior of the static quark anti - quark free energy ; it gives the excess in free energy needed to screen two well - separated color charges .",

    "in this contribution we discussed different quantities , which characterize the deconfinement and chiral transition in qcd at non - zero temperature and studied their cutoff dependence .",
    "we showed that when the kaon decay constant @xmath3 is used to set the scale ( lattice spacing ) the cutoff effects in different quantities are quite small and calculations performed with the asqtad and hisq / tree actions are in good agreement with calculations performed with the stout action .",
    "we pointed out that it is difficult to define the deconfinement temperature .",
    "different observables that are used to characterize the deconfinement transition show rapid rise at different temperatures , which in turn , could be different from the chiral transition temperature .",
