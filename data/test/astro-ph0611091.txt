    "spheroids ( i.e. elliptical and lenticular galaxies , or collectively early - type galaxies ) are observed to obey tight empirical scaling relations , i.e. correlations between observable properties .",
    "well known examples of tight scaling relations are the fundamental plane ( dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; hereafter fp ) and the m@xmath4-@xmath5 relation ( ferrarese & merritt 2001 ; gebhardt et al.2001 ) .",
    "the connection between observables involving dynamics , stellar populations , and the mass of the central black hole , indicates that mass assembly , star formation history , and nuclear activity are interconnected .",
    "a common application of scaling relations in the distant universe is their use as `` generalized standard rods '' .",
    "for example the fp is often used to derive the evolution of the effective mass to light ratio as a function of mass and redshift ( franx 1993 ; treu et al.1999 ) . assuming pure luminosity evolution this",
    "can then be converted into a star formation history ( treu et al .",
    "2005a , b ) .",
    "similarly the evolution of the m@xmath6-@xmath5 relation can be used to quantify the relative growth of bulges and black holes over cosmic time ( e.g. shields et al .",
    "2003 ; woo et al .",
    "2006 ) . here",
    "i will briefly report on recent progress in two areas : the evolution of the fundamental plane , and that of a less known scaling relation , i.e. the correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and total mass as measured by strong gravitational lensing .",
    "by defining an effective mass @xmath7 in the terms of stellar velocity dispersion and effective radius ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the so - called virial coefficient ) the fp can be seen as a scaling relation between @xmath7 and the effective mass - to - light ratio @xmath10 .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath10 is proportional to the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath11 , the fp provides a very robust measurement of the evolution of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "note that this procedure does not assume a constant virial coefficient as a function of mass , but only that the virial coefficient be constant as a function of time at any given mass .",
    "-@xmath10 plane .",
    "the local relation is shown as a dotted line for comparison .",
    "hatched regions are excluded by the magnitude limit .",
    "although selection effects enhance the observed evolution at the low mass end , careful modeling shows that the evolutionary rate depends on mass , and that the intrinsic scatter of the fp increases with redshift . from treu",

    "[ fig1],title=\"fig:\",height=259 ]    observational studies are now capable of probing out to redshift @xmath13 with samples of over 100 objects , covering more than an order of magnitude in @xmath7 .",
    "the main results are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ( see also van der wel et al .",
    "2005 and di serego et al .",
    "the fp evolves with redshift , in the sense that galaxies were brighter at high - z than today for a given mass .",
    "evolution is slowest for the most massive objects , consistent with pure luminosity evolution if the most massive galaxies have the oldest stellar populations . in terms of assembly history",
    ", the fraction of stellar mass assembled below @xmath1 is constrained to be of order 1% for the most massive objects ( @xmath14 ) , and up to @xmath15 for galaxies of masses of order @xmath16 m@xmath17 .",
    "this is another manifestation of the concept of downsizing , sometimes called anti - hierarchical behavior .",
    "recent theoretical work suggests that agn feedback could reconcile this trend with the hierarchical paradigm .",
    "direct empirical tests of this mechanism are needed .",
    "a recent explosion in the number of gravitational lenses with measured stellar velocity dispersion @xmath5 ( @xmath18 ; bolton et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 and in prep . )",
    "allows one to study systematically the scaling of @xmath5 with @xmath12 , i.e. the velocity dispersion of the singular isothermal ellipsoid that best fits the lensing geometry .",
    "the latter is a very robust , and almost model independent , measure of mass within the critical line , i.e. approximately within a cylinder of radius the einstein radius .",
    "this is typically in the range 0.5 - 5 @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath5 measures the mass inside @xmath20 , this scaling relation effectively provides a measurement of the slope of the mass density profile .",
    "modulo small corrections due to anisotropy , projection effects , and the precise location of the einstein radius with respect to the effective radius , a ratio of unity indicates an isothermal total mass density profile ( see treu & koopmans 2002 , 2004 , koopmans & treu 2003 , koopmans et al .",
    "2006 , for detailed modeling ) .",
    "this is observed to be generally the case within the errors , with few outliers ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this tight scaling relation can be seen as the result of a `` bulge - halo conspiracy '' , because neither of the two components has an isothermal profile and yet the sum of the two is very close to it .",
    "remarkably , no significant evolution of the total mass density slope is detected .",
    "whatever mechanism produces the conspiracy it seems to be at work at high - z for these massive galaxies .",
    "note that slacs lens galaxies are indistinguishable from a control sample of identically selected non - lens early - type galaxies within the current observational uncertainties ( treu et al .",
    "2006 ) , and therefore these results can be generalized to the entire population of massive early - type galaxies . from an observational point of view , there is room for improvement , especially at @xmath21 , where the samples are still pitifully small and sdss runs out of lenses .",
    "a comparable sample of @xmath22 lenses at @xmath21 would help enormously to understand evolutionary trends .",
    "finally , i will briefly discuss the fraction of dark matter as a function of mass .",
    "there is convincing evidence that the most massive early - type galaxies have dark matter halos more extended than the stellar component , but the evidence is not quite as compelling for less massive galaxies . determining the relative contribution of dark and stellar matter as a function of mass is important for a number of reasons , e.g. understanding the efficiency of star formation as a function of mass , and the interplay between baryons and dark matter . in terms of scaling relations ,",
    "one of the possible explanations of the so - called `` tilt '' of the fundamental plane is a systematic increase with effective mass of the dark matter fraction inside some fiducial radius ( e.g. ciotti et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "a joint lensing and dynamical analysis of the slacs+lsd sample ( treu & koopmans 2004 ; koopmans et al . 2006 ) provides a robust measurement of the fraction of dark matter at the einstein radius for each lens .",
    "since lenses span a range in velocity dispersions ( a proxy for mass ) and in einstein radii ( expressed in units of the effective radius ) this appears to be a promising way to attack this problem .",
    "the promise of this method is illustrated in figure  [ fig : mass ] . in the left panel ,",
    "i show the fraction of dark matter inside the einstein radius as derived from the lensing and dynamical analysis as a function of the einstein radius in units of the effective radius .",
    "if the dark matter halo is more spatially extended than the light , the fraction of dark matter will be increasing with radius .",
    "therefore , this effect has to be taken into account , in order to study trends with velocity dispersion .",
    "one way to decouple the dependency on radius from that on mass is to look at deviations from a simple reference model , known to work quite well for the most massive systems ( e.g. treu & koopmans 2002 ) .",
    "this simple model consists of an isothermal total mass profile , including a jaffe ( 1983 ) profile representing the stars ( the remaining mass is assumed to be dark matter ) .",
    "the jaffe profile is normalized so that the fraction of dark matter is zero at the center .",
    "thus , the fraction of dark matter is a universal function of radius in units of the effective radius , shown by a solid line in the figure . in the right panel ,",
    "i show the dark matter deficit / excess with respect to the simple reference model .",
    "tantalizingly , it seems that the simple model works very well for the most massive systems , while the least massive systems appear to show a deficit of dark matter with respect to the model .",
    "drawing quantitative conclusions from this preliminary analysis is premature , as a comprehensive analysis of a much enlarged sample of lenses is underway .",
    "i would like to acknowledge the many contributions to this work from my friends and collaborators richard ellis , lon koopmans , adam bolton , scott burles , and leonidas moustakas .",
