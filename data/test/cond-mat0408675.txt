    "then , within an approach close to that used earlier by one of us to describe the dynamics of large total spins of magnetic polarons @xcite , we analyze the schroedinger equation in the hyperspin space , and show that the number of relevant variables in the equation can be reduced , and its quasi - classical solution can be found .",
    "it turns out that the dynamics of the parametric oscillator can be described by the liouville equation where the squared wavefunction of the parametric oscillator plays the role of a classical distribution function .",
    "we show that polaritons pass from the pump to the signal state with some delay , and that the populations of the pump , signal and idler states demonstrate dumped oscillations about their average values .",

    "so , initially , the width of the wavefunction is the same as the oscillator length , but in - plane components of the pseudopsin rapidly increase with time ( see eq.(12 ) ) , and the wavefunction spreads into the region of validity of the quasi - classical model .",
    "this means that the dynamics of the pseudospin is quasi - classical at any time except the short initial time range , where the system obeys analytically solvable eqs.(12 ) .",

    "one can see that at time @xmath177  ps the hyperspin formalism and direct diagonalization give utterly similar results .",

    "these values are confirmed by the direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( @xmath145 ) which gives @xmath189 and @xmath191 respectively .",
    "such values are different from those obtained in ref . for constant wave pumping .",
    "it may seem strange that coherence dissapears in the interacting system .",
    "however this result becomes clear if one notices that in the case of the polariton laser the spontaneous coherence build - up is possible if the incoming scattering rate to the ground state is larger than the outgoing scattering rate @xcite . in our case of a three level system ,",
    "incoming and outgoing rates are actually the same and the coherence is destroyed by multiple scattering processes .",
    "the calculated populations and statistics for the polaritons with finite lifetime are presented in figure 5 .",
    "the lifetimes for all states were choosen identical and equal to @xmath192  ps .",
    "one can see in the case of initially coherent pump ( fig .",
    "5a ) that the populations of signal and pump states behave nonmonotonously . from the very beginning polaritons",
    "start passing from the pump state to the signal and idler states , while initially this process goes spontaneously , and signal population growth slowly .",
    "then , stimulated scattering switches on , and both signal and pump populations change rapidly .",
    "then the process of return of polaritons from signal and idler to the pump state starts , etc . because of the finite lifetime , the total number of particles in the system decreases .",
    "when it falls below the stimulation threshold @xmath193 no more oscillations of the occupation numbers of signal and pump states can be seen .",
    "the situation is different in the case of the thermal pump ( see fig .",
    "5b ) : no pronounced oscillations can be seen for the pump population , however the sharp bend of the time dependence of the pump population and the increase of the signal population demonstrate that the parametric process takes place nevertheless .",
    "interestingly , introduction of lifetime in the system results in better coherence at @xmath194  ps @xmath195 in the case of coherent pumping and in almost the same value @xmath196 for the initially thermal pump .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented the general formalism describing the dynamics of the optical parametric oscillator based on a semiconductor microcavity in the strong coupling regime in the case of large number of polaritons .",
    "the introduction of the hyperspin allows to obtain a quasi - classical solution of the quantum parametric - oscillator problem .",
