    "speckle is the random granular pattern produced when a coherent light is scattered off a rough surface .",
    "it carries information of the specimen surface , for the intensity and contrast of the speckle image vary with the roughness of surface being illuminated.@xcite numerous approaches have been devised to identify surface profiles by either the speckle contrast or the speckle correlation method.@xcite recent application of pulsed soft x - ray laser has improved the temporal and spatial resolution to a scale of picosecond and nanometer . by this means , dynamics of surface polarization clusters of barium titanate ( batio@xmath0 ) across the curie temperature ( @xmath1 ) has been observed,@xcite which paves a new way to study the paraelectric - ferroelectric phase transition .    as a prototype of the ferroelectric perovskite compounds ,",
    "batio@xmath0 undergoes a transition from paraelectric cubic to ferroelectric tetragonal phase at @xmath1=395 k. below @xmath1 , two kinds of ferroelectric domain are developed with mutually perpendicular polarization .",
    "structural phase transition and domain induced surface corrugation have been observed via atomic force microscopy,@xcite scanning probe microscopy,@xcite neutron scattering,@xcite and polarizing optical microscopy.@xcite in addition to the extensive application of batio@xmath0 in technology due to its high dielectric constant and switchable spontaneous polarization,@xcite there is also an enduring interest in understanding the mechanism of paraelectric - ferroelectric phase transition .",
    "it is generally considered that the transition is a classic displacive soft - mode type driven by the anharmonic lattice dynamics.@xcite however , recent studies have also suggested an order - disorder instability which coexists with the displacive transition.@xcite therefore , direct observation on creation and evolution of ferroelectric cluster around @xmath1 is of crucial importance for clarifying the nature of phase transition .",
    "since the above - mentioned conventional time - average - based measurements can not be adapted to the detection on ultrafast transient status of dipole clusters , diffraction speckle pattern of batio@xmath0 crystal measured by the picosecond soft x - ray laser has turned out to be an efficient way for this purpose .",
    "very recently , namikawa _",
    "et al._@xcite study the polarization clusters in batio@xmath0 at above @xmath1 by the plasma - based x - ray laser speckle measurement in combination with the technique of pump probe spectroscopy . in this experiment , two consecutive soft x - ray laser pulses with wavelength of 160  and an adjustable time difference",
    "are generated coherently by the michelson type beam splitter .",
    "after the photo excitation by the pump pulse , ferroelectric clusters of nano scale are created in the paraelectric batio@xmath0 and tends to be smeared out gradually on the way back to the equilibrium paraelectric state .",
    "this relaxation of cluster thus can be reflected in the variation of speckle intensity of the probe pulse as a function of its delay time from the first pulse .",
    "it has been found that the intensity of speckle pattern decays as the delay time increases .",
    "moreover , the decay rate also decreases upon approaching @xmath1 , indicating a critical slowing down of the cluster relaxation time .",
    "hence , by measuring the correlation between two soft x - ray laser pulses , the real time relaxation dynamics of polarization clusters in batio@xmath0 is clearly represented . in comparison with other time - resolved spectroscopic study on batio@xmath0 , for example the photon correlation spectroscopy with visible laser beam,@xcite namikawa s experiment employs pulsed soft x - ray laser as the light source . for this sake , the size of photo - created ferroelectric cluster is reduced down to a few nanometers , and the cluster relaxation time is at a scale of picosecond .",
    "this measurement , thus , offers a new insight into the ultrafast quantum dynamics of domain structure .    in this work",
    ", we examine the above - mentioned novel behaviors of ferroelectric cluster observed by namikawa from a theoretical point of view , aiming to provide a basis for understanding the critical nature of batio@xmath0 .",
    "theoretically , the dynamics of a system can be adequately described by the linear response theory , _",
    "i.e. _ , to express the dynamic quantities in terms of time correlation functions of the corresponding dynamic operators . in general ,",
    "the path integral quantum monte carlo method is computationally feasible to handle the quantum many body problems , for it allows the system to be treated without making any approximation .",
    "however , simulation on real time dynamics with monte carlo method is still an open problem in computational physics because of the formidable numerical cost of path summation which grows exponentially with the propagation time . the common approach to circumvent",
    "this problem is to perform imaginary time path integration followed by analytic continuation , and to compute the real time dynamic quantities using fourier transformation . in the present study ,",
    "the real time correlation functions and real time dependence of speckle pattern are investigated by this scheme .",
    "our quantum monte carlo simulation demonstrates that the relaxation dynamics of photo - created nano clusters plays an essential role in determining the delay time dependence of speckle variation .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the critical slowing down of photorelaxation is related to the local dipole fluctuation , which arises near @xmath1 and stablizes the photo - created ferroelectric cluster .    the remaining of the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the model hamiltonian and theoretical treatment are elaborated . in sec .",

    "the on - site potential is represented as a polynomial form of the order parameter such as polarization , displacement , or elasticity , which displays a substantial change around @xmath1 .",
    "since the @xmath2 model is only limited to second - order transitions , in the present work we invoke a modified krumhansl - schrieffer model ( also called @xmath3 model)@xcite to study the first - order ferroelectric phase transition of batio@xmath0 . in this scenario ,",

    "we design a theoretical model to incorporate the radiation field and a weak interplay between radiation and crystal .",

    "in this sense , the time dependence is primarily determined by the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) .",
