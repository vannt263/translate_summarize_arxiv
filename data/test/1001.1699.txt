    "relativistic heavy ion collisions offer a possibility to study nuclear matter under extreme collisions , at high temperatures and densities , in the laboratory .",
    "it is expected that at high temperature and baryon density , nuclear matter melts into a state of free quarks and gluons , known as the quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "the study of strange hadron production is a good diagnostic tool to investigate the properties of matter created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the measured final distributions of strange hadrons may give insight into strangeness production in the hot and dense stage of the reaction .",
    "almost 25 years ago the authors in  @xcite suggested that strange particle production should be enhanced in collisions with qgp production in comparison to those without qgp and could thus serve as a unique signature of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "this enhancement can be quantified by the ratio of yields in nucleus+nucleus to p+p collisions where the system is very small and the qgp creation is not expected .",
    "rapidity distributions for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xcite measured for different centralities in pb+pb collisions at @xmath0 = 8.7 gev .",
    "the closed symbols indicate measured points , whereas the open symbols are reflected with respect to midrapidity . ]",
    "the na49 detector  @xcite is a large acceptance hadron spectrometer at the cern sps , featuring four large volume tpcs as tracking detectors .",
    "two of them are positioned inside two superconducting dipole magnets .",
    "the ionization energy loss ( de / dx ) measurements are used for particle identification in the tpcs with a typical resolution of 4% at forward rapidities .",
    "the de / dx resolution allows in the laboratory frame of the main - tpcs hadron identification for p @xmath9 4 gev / c with typical k/@xmath10 and k / p separation power of @xmath111.5@xmath12 .",
    "furthermore the two time - of - flight walls ( resolution @xmath13  =  60  ps ) improve the separation power in selected regions around midrapidity .",
    "the centrality of a given reaction is determined on the basis of the energy of the projectile spectator nucleons measured by the forward calorimeter .",
    "the na49 experiment has collected data on central pb+pb collisions at 5 beam energies in the range @xmath0 = 6.3 - 17.3 gev and minimum bias pb+pb collisions at @xmath0 = 8.7 gev and 17.3 gev . also data on c+c and si+si collisions as well as p+p interactions where taken at @xmath0 = 17.3 gev .",
    "the na49 experiment features a large acceptance in the forward hemisphere allowing measurements of rapidity spectra from midrapidity up to almost beam rapidity .",
    "figures  [ fig : fig1 ] and  [ fig : fig2 ] show rapidity spectra for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xcite for different centralities in pb+pb collisions at @xmath0 = 8.7 and 17.3 gev , where the closed points represent the measured data and the open symbols represent the reflected points at midrapidity .",

    "the total multiplicity is extracted by fitting a ( double- ) gaussian distribution to the rapidity spectra .",
    "it is visible that the width of the pion rapidity - spectra changes with centrality .",
    "the distribution become broader when moving to peripheral collisions which might indicate that the influence of resonance decays is much more pronounced for peripheral collisions . in comparison",
    "the width of the charged kaons does not change with the centrality of the collision .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows the strangeness enhancement factor @xmath14 at midrapidity ( @xmath15y@xmath15 @xmath16 0.5 ) for mesons ( left ) and baryons ( right ) as a function of the number of wounded nucleons @xmath17 , calculated within the glauber model  @xcite , at @xmath0 = 17.3 gev  @xcite .",
    "the strangeness enhancement @xmath14 is defined as the yield per wounded nucleon in pb+pb collisions normalized to the corresponding yield in p+p interactions :    @xmath18    an enhancement is visible for mesons and baryons . for mesons a clear hierarchy is visible from particles without strange quarks ( @xmath10 ) to particles with two strange quarks ( @xmath19 ) when going from p+p to pb+pb collisions .",
    "a similar behavior is visible for baryons , except the @xmath8 which does not show any enhancement .",
    "furthermore the enhancement factor increases fast for @xmath20 @xmath21 60 and then approximately saturates .",
    "various approaches have been used to explain the centrality / system size dependence of ( non-)strange particle production .",
    "one approach is the core - corona model  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the core of a heavy ion collisions is fully thermalized and strangeness is produced according to equilibrium hadron gas .",
    "the core is surrounded by a corona which can be modeled as a superposition of elementary p+p reactions .",
    "another approach is using a hydrodynamic model with a transport model as afterburner  @xcite .",
    "one finds that strangeness equilibration is only reached in pb+pb collisions . the equilibrium is also reached in peripheral pb+pb collisions , whereas for c+c and si+si interactions a better description is obtained with a binary scattering transport approach like urqmd  @xcite which does not assume equilibration .",
    "both approaches provide a good description of the data .",

    "the strangeness enhancement factor increases further when going from the sps to ags energies .",
    "this trend can be understood due to an increasing suppression of strangeness production in p+p interactions with decreasing energy because of energy conservation  @xcite .",

    "this leads to the conclusion that a large part of the reduction of the @xmath4 yields could be due to rescattering of the decay daughters during the hadronic stage of the fireball and indicates that this stage lasts for a time comparable to the lifetime of the resonance .",
