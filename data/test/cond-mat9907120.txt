    "some twenty years ago alexander and mctague applied the formalism of landau theory to the freezing transition of atomic materials @xcite . using symmetry arguments they suggested that a bcc crystal should be the universally favored crystal structure , independent of interaction details .",
    "this theory attempts to describe the solid as a small , spatially periodic perturbation of a liquid . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we argued that such an approach should only be valid near the liquid - solid spinodal , at which the liquid state becomes locally unstable .",
    "the position of the spinodal is determined by the fourier transform of the liquid direct correlation function @xmath2 , and is given by the smallest density @xmath3 for which the equation @xmath4 has a solution .",
    "moreover , the perturbative approach does not apply to the local minima of the free energy in order - parameter space , which correspond to metastable or stable crystals , but rather to its saddle points . for the latter we confirmed universal behavior near the spinodal , which may have implications for nucleation @xcite .",
    "the hard - sphere fluid has become the canonical model for freezing , since it captures in the most simple form the dominant packing effects while attractive interactions are believed to play only a secondary role .",
    "the best current theories for hard - sphere freezing are various versions of density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "usually they are explicitely constructed to reproduce the percus - yevick approximation @xmath5 for the hard - sphere direct correlation function . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpspin ] we show the values of @xmath6 evaluated at the wave number @xmath7 corresponding to the maximum at a given density @xmath3 .",
    "one finds that there is no solution to eq .",
    "( [ spindef ] ) at physical densities @xmath3 below the space filling density @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the particle diameter ( at and beyond this limit @xmath5 is not defined ) .",
    "this implies that those dfts do not exhibit a liquid - solid spinodal at all .",
    "therefore the saddle point solution branch of the stationarity equation derived from the density functional can not connect to the liquid branch when the bulk density is increased . on the other hand ,",
    "hard - core systems are characterized by a close - packing density as the maximum possible density of a given crystal structure . upon approaching this limit a suitably defined crystalline order parameter , e.g.",
    ", the inverse width of the density peaks , will diverge along the stable ( minimum ) branch .",
    "one may surmise that that is also true along the saddle point branch .",
    "thus an alternative scenario to the bifurcation of a crystalline solution from the liquid at a spinodal point as discussed in [ bif ] , are two solid solution branches smoothly connected to each other at low densities which diverge at close packing and are completely isolated from the liquid . in order to test this hypothesis in the present work we examine the close - packing limit in detail using dfts that have previously been applied to the low - density solid near the phase transition .",
    "clearly , the strong localization of the particles in this limit provides an extreme case for such liquid - state based theories .",
    "hence it is a good testing ground for assessing the qualities of different approximations .",
    "in contrast to most dft studies of the hard - sphere solid we do not restrict the shape of the density peaks to gaussians , but allow for general spherically symmetric peaks .",
    "this is especially interesting for the completely anharmonic hard - sphere crystal for which there is no a priori argument to justify gaussians , even for small amplitude particle oscillations .",
    "the starting point of density - functional theory is the free energy functional of the inhomogeneous particle density @xmath10 with the general form @xmath11=f_{id}[\\rho({{\\bf r}})]+f_{ex}[\\rho({{\\bf r}})].\\ ] ] the ideal gas contribution is given by [ @xmath12 @xmath13=\\int d^3r \\rho({{\\bf r}})[\\ln\\rho({{\\bf r}})\\lambda^3 - 1]\\ ] ] with the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath14 .",
    "while the excess part @xmath15 is not known exactly , a large number of approximate forms have been suggested and applied to various problems in the last decades @xcite .",
    "as we do not strive for completeness we will consider only two representative variants in this paper : the ramakrishnan - yussouff functional @xcite which is one of the first and simplest approximations that have been studied , and the fundamental measure functional developed by rosenfeld and coworkers @xcite which at the present is believed to provide the best theoretical description of the hard - sphere fluid . from a given functional the equilibrium density distribution at a given bulk density @xmath16",
    "is obtained by minimization under the constraint @xmath17 .",
    "the value of the functional at its minimum is the actual free energy of the system . for both functionals we performed numerical calculations at a series of bulk densities as well as an analytical analysis of the close - packing limit which enables us to determine the asymptotic density profile and free energy .",
    "the ramakrishnan - yussouff functional follows from a density expansion of @xmath15 around the homogeneous state truncated at the quadratic term : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the free energy density and @xmath20 the direct correlation function ( dcf ) of the hard - sphere liquid at an effective density @xmath21 , both of which are commonly approximated by the analytically known solutions of the percus - yevick integral equation . in a solid the density",
    "consists of a sum of identical peaks centered at the lattice sites @xmath22 : @xmath23 throughout this paper it is assumed that the peaks are normalized @xmath24 and that the nearest - neighbour distance @xmath25 in the lattice is determined by the bulk density , @xmath26 where @xmath9 is the particle diameter and @xmath27 is the maximum possible density . in order to reduce the dimensionality of the integrations we moreover assume that @xmath28 is spherically symmetric .",
    "deviations from this symmetry exist @xcite , but are small especially near close packing @xcite .",

    "hence for the strongly peaked profiles in high density solids only the first shell of lattice vectors ( @xmath45 ) and the term with @xmath37 must be taken into account .",

    "this unphysical behavior vanishes in the close - packing limit .",
    "the dcf has been evaluated at the bulk density , @xmath56 .",
    "this most obvious choice has the disadvantage that the solid has a higher free energy than the liquid at all densities , as already pointed out in [ baus:85 ] . in the earliest dft work",
    "the density of the coexisting liquid has been used instead , but that is not very reasonable when high density solids are considered .",
    "other schemes to select a density @xmath21 of an `` effective liquid '' have been proposed [ baus:85,baus:89,evansrev:92 ] , which always imply @xmath57 .",

    "now the maximum does not occur and the convergence to the limiting shape is faster .",
    "the profiles are considerably flatter at small @xmath49 than a gaussian of the same width .",
    "the results shown in figs .  [ fig : rhory ] and [ fig : rhoryliq ] clearly demonstrate that , in spite of contrary claims @xcite , simple density - functional theories based on the percus - yevick dcf do exhibit a well - defined close - packing limit at which the peak width goes to zero .",
    "we will analyze this limit in more detail in the following .",

    "( [ elgal ] ) is zero both at @xmath81 and @xmath82 and positive in between which implies a maximum at a finite value of @xmath63 .",

    "there are no stationary points with vanishing peak width at @xmath87 .",
    "this is the case for the `` onsager solid '' discussed in [ bif ] which belongs to the same class of approximate functionals , but with @xmath88 replaced by its low - density limit @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath90 is larger ( e.g. , @xmath91 ) the solution with smaller @xmath63 corresponds to a saddle point and the solution with larger @xmath63 to the stable solid minimum .",
    "we emphasize that the widths @xmath61 for both solutions tend to zero for @xmath92 . in fig .",

    "it has been conjectured in a dft study of the isotropic - nematic transition of hard rods @xcite that in general the saddle point is not accessible by iteration because it corresponds to an unstable fixed point ( see also [ scheurle:77 ] ) .",

    "( [ elgasy ] ) . due to the form of @xmath102",
    "the right hand side goes to a constant for @xmath103 , which means that no normalized solution on @xmath104 can exist .",

    "the solution now depends on the cutoff , but in practice this dependence is extremely weak because the constant approached for large @xmath107 is of the order of @xmath108 so that the contributions from the tail of @xmath73 are neglegible for any reasonable value of the cutoff .",

    "fundamental measure theory at present represents the best available dft for strongly inhomogeneous hard - sphere fluids .",
    "in contrast to most previous approaches it does not depend on the direct correlation function as an input , but rather reproduces the percus - yevick correlation function as an output of the theory in the homogeneous limit . while the originial expressions @xcite gave a divergent excess free energy for strongly localized particles , a recent empirical modification proved suitable also for the description of the freezing transition @xcite . we will call this version fmt1 .",

    "the ideal term now enforces @xmath188 to be constant in the maximum allowed region c that is compatible with @xmath212 .",
    "it can be constructed by shifting the bounding planes of the wigner - seitz cell inward by @xmath132 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cell ] ) .",
    "a given point @xmath34 in c contributes to the weighted densities at @xmath35 only if @xmath213 . by construction",
    "all such @xmath35 lie within the wigner - seitz cell and thus can not be `` reached '' from any @xmath34 in the cell c around another site , which means that b is indeed empty .",
    "however if a point p outside of c were added the distance to its mirror point p with respect to the closest wigner - seitz boundary plane would be less than @xmath9 so that elements of b would lie on their joining line ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cell ] ) .",
    "the cell c constructed here is identical to that of the self - consistent cell theory @xcite .",
    "its volume for an fcc solid is @xmath214 .",
    "we now turn to the second approximation ( fmt2 ) for which @xmath215 and @xmath110 are the dominant contributions .",
    "( remember that @xmath184 is independent of @xmath73 in leading order . )",
    "analogous to eq .",
    "( [ phi3blim ] ) we have , up to higher orders in @xmath159 , @xmath216 with @xmath217 . the corresponding stationarity equation is @xmath218 the functional derivative is calculated as in sect .",
    "[ dftprof ] . the resulting asymptotic profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhofmtn ] is close to those obtained for finite densities using the full functional .",
    "it is almost , but not exactly gaussian .",
    "the asymptotic free energy of the fundamental - measure theory also has the form eq .",
    "( [ ftotasy ] ) . in fmt1 one",
    "has @xmath219 . under the constraint of spherical symmetry this is replaced by @xmath220 , both of which are much closer to the correct value than the ramakrishnan - yussouff theory .",
    "results for finite distance from close packing are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftotlog ] and agree , probably by accident , rather well with the computer simulations .",
    "the approach to the asymptotic law is quite slow . on the other hand for fmt2 not only the profiles but also the free energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ftotlog ] ) approach their asymptotic limit faster in this version of the theory . the value of the constant in eq .",
    "( [ ftotasy ] ) is found to be @xmath221 in very good agreement with the md results .",
    "however , in view of the relatively large change in @xmath111 due to nonsphericity of the profiles as observed for fmt1 , this may well be fortuitous .",
    "we did not consider nonspherical profiles in fmt2 .      in view of the discussion in the introduction",
    "it would be interesting also to keep track of the saddle point between the liquid and the solid state when close packing is approached .",
    "unfortunately , again one is plagued by the fact that the iteration of the stationarity equation does not converge to a second solution .",
    "furthermore the arguments of the asymptotic analysis do not apply to the saddle point because they essentially involve a minimization in two steps .",
    "hence one must revert to parametrizations of the density with a few parameters . for gaussians and step functions",
    "the saddle point occurs at a width @xmath70 proportional to @xmath222 in fmt1 and to @xmath223 in fmt2 .",
    "however , a priori there is no reason to assume that at the saddle point the profile has a similar shape as at the minimum .",
    "we also tried profiles of the forms @xmath224 and @xmath225 and found numerically that in both cases the free energy at the maximum with respect to @xmath70 decreases with decreasing @xmath52 , down to the lowest feasible values of @xmath52 .",
    "this suggests that the actual saddle point profile may decay very slowly , while within these restricted classes of profiles a true saddle point at a nondegenerate profile seems not to exist .",
    "although an extensive computer simulation study of the density distribution in hard - sphere crystals has been carried out before @xcite , no useful results for the radial distribution function have been published . in order to assess the quality of the various theories we therefore undertook a small monte carlo ( mc ) simulation ourselves . in an nvt ensemble of @xmath226 spheres in an fcc arrangement we measured the distribution of the particles distance @xmath49 from their equilibrium sites .",
    "we corrected for the movement of these sites due to shifts in the center of mass .",
    "measurements were taken over @xmath227 mc steps per particle for two bulk densities .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rholog ] on a logarithmic scale versus @xmath228 and compared to the various dft calculations .",
    "the quantitative agreement is excellent for fmt2 .",
    "the profiles are close to gaussians but decay faster at large distance than a gaussian fitted to the small distance part .",
    "the dependence of the scaled profiles on bulk density is rather small in the examined range , but still qualitatively reproduced by the theory .",
    "the actual width of the profiles will increase with increasing particle number @xcite , but we did not attempt to correct for finite size effects . in [ young:74 ]",
    "it was found that in the thermodynamic limit for high densities the width behaves as @xmath229 , again in almost perfect agreement with fmt2 , for which @xmath230 .",
    "this means that fmt2 is the first dft which yields the correct value of the lindemann parameter .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the close - packing limit of the hard - sphere crystal using three versions of dft .",
    "all of them predict a peak width @xmath70 that vanishes proportional to the free distance @xmath0 and yields a logarihmic term in the free energy ( see eq .",
    "( [ ftotasy ] ) ) stemming from the ideal gas entropy .",
    "numerically this has been observed before , for gaussian peaks , in two other dfts , the generalized liquid approximation ( gela ) and the modified weighted density approximation ( mwda ) @xcite . for the latter , however ,",
    "it was found later that the solutions correspond to `` unphysical '' branches @xcite .",
    "the relative performance of the different theories can be judged from the profile shape obtained by free minimization .",
    "ry gives too narrow profiles with an unphysical maximum if the bulk density is used as the expansion point ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rhory ] ) .",
    "the shape and width are also wrong for other expansion points ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoryliq ] ) .",
    "fmt1 predicts asymptotically steplike profiles confined to the cells of cell theory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rhofmt ] ) . only the fmt2 profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rhofmtn ] ) are in quantitative agreement with simulations at high densities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rholog ] ) . in spite of the anharmonicity of the hard - sphere crystal they are close to gaussians . similarly the results for the next - to - leading free energy contribution improve from ry to fmt1 to fmt2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ftotlog ] ) , the two fmt versions being much closer to the correct result than ry .",
    "this could have been expected from the way the ry approximation is constructed : a density expansion around a liquid state certainly is difficult to justify for the highly ordered high - density crystal .",
    "if one restricts the profiles to a fixed shape saddle points of the free energy are found at widths decaying @xmath231 with @xmath232 , @xmath233 , and @xmath234 .",
    "insofar the global scenario for the crystalline solutions proposed in the introduction is comfirmed ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : biflogges ] ) .",
    "however , as detailed in sec .",
    "[ saddle ] , in larger classes of functions the saddle point remains elusive .",
    "we remark that the saddle point is a property closely connected to the mean - field type free energy functional and , e.g. , is not directly accessible by computer simulations .",
    "comparing the two variants of fmt we see that the structure in the close - packing limit is sensitive to subtle differences between dft approximations and thus might be a guiding line in the construction of better fmt - like functionals . besides our fmt1",
    "some other approximations for @xmath235 have been suggested in [ rosenfeld:97 ] which are all of the form @xmath236 the power of @xmath237 is determined by dimensional arguments and the function @xmath238 can only depend on the absolute value of @xmath239 because of the isotropy of space . from eqs .",
    "( [ n2lim ] ) and ( [ nv2lim ] ) we have @xmath240 in region a. in order not to spoil the correct leading order for a quasi - zero - dimensional situation as given by @xmath184 one has the additional requirement @xmath241 with @xmath242 , which implies @xmath243 .",
    "but in region b @xmath244 varies between zero and one so that always @xmath245 .",
    "the function @xmath238 must be nonnegative in this range , otherwise the functional would not be bounded from below [ this happened in the original fmt @xcite for which @xmath246 .",
    "then the argument of sec .",
    "[ cpfmt ] runs through and the asymptotic profiles will always be step functions . we conclude that an improved description of the high density solid is not possible within fmt if only the scalar and vector weighted densities are used , the tensor weight function of fmt2 is inevitable . on the other hand in fmt2 the behavior near close packing",
    "is exclusively determined by @xmath247 so that no conditions on the precise form of @xmath235 can be deduced .",
    "we thank sander pronk for providing the monte carlo program and y. rosenfeld for stimulating discussions .",
