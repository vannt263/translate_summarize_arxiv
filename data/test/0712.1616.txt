    "in the classical world it is relatively easy to compare ( quantitatively , or qualitatively ) features of physical systems and to conclude with certainty whether the systems possess the same properties , or not . on the other hand , the statistical nature of the quantum theory restricts our ability to provide deterministic conclusions / predictions even in the simplest experimental situations .",
    "therefore comparison of quantum states is totally different compared to classical situation . to be specific , let us consider that we are given two quantum systems of the same physical origin ( e.g. , two photons ) and our task is to conclude whether these two photons have been prepared in the same polarization state .",
    "that is , we want to compare the two states and we want to know whether they are identical or not .",
    "given the fact that we have just a single copy of each state the scenario according to which we first measure each state does not work .",
    "for that we would need an infinite ensemble of identically prepared systems .",
    "the solution to the problem of comparison of quantum states has been proposed by barnett _",
    "@xcite : within quantum realm we can compare two states , but there is a price to pay .",
    "for instance , one can not conclude with certainty that two systems are in the same _ pure _ state or not , except for the case when the set of possible pure states is linearly independent @xcite .",
    "the _ unambiguous _ state comparison as introduced by barnett _",
    "et al . _ is a positive - operator - value - measure ( povm ) measurement that has two possible outcomes associated with the two answers : the two states are different , or outcome of the measurement corresponds to an inconclusive answer .",
    "moreover , the existence of the negative answer strongly depends on the particular quantum states @xmath4 in the following sense . to give the unambiguous conclusion that the states are different it is necessary to restrict ourselves to states , which have distinct supports @xcite . in the quantum comparison problem",
    "as discussed by barnett , chefles , jex and andersson @xcite it is assumed that the unknown states are pure and only a single copy of each of them is available .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to find the optimal unambiguous state comparison procedure in the case we have more copies of the two quantum states which we want to compare . throughout the paper",
    "we assume that the compared states are pure and that they belong to a @xmath5-dimensional hilbert space @xmath6 .",
    "the dimensionality of the hilbert space in known , otherwise no further information about the states is available . in the case of ( semi)-infinite dimensional hilbert space @xmath7 ( corresponding to a harmonic oscillator )",
    "we restrict our investigation to a specific case , when we a priori know that the two states to be compared are coherent states .",
    "what is not known are their complex amplitudes",
    ". our goal will be to design an optimal quantum comparison machine .",
    "as in the case of only one copy per each of the two compared states it is not possible to unambiguously conclude that the compared states are the same .",
    "thus , the positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) describing the measurement apparatus @xcite will have only two measurement elements @xmath8 indicating the failure of the measurement and @xmath9 unambiguously showing that the compared states are different .",
    "in the paper we will derive the optimal multi - copy comparator for general pure states ( sec .",
    "ii ) and for coherent states ( sec .",
    "iii ) . in both cases",
    "we will investigate the behavior of the success probability as a function of the number of copies @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the two states .",
    "moreover , we will propose a relatively simple experimental setup realizing the comparison of coherent states .",
    "let us consider that we have @xmath10 copies of the first unknown state ( further denoted as @xmath2 ) and @xmath11 copies of the second unknown state ( denoted as @xmath3 ) .",
    "our task is to either unambiguously conclude that the states @xmath12 are different , or to admit that we can not give a definite answer whether they are identical or different .",
    "the optimal measurement that would allow us to implement this task follows from the work by chefles _",
    "@xcite who analyzed the problem from a more general perspective .",
    "they have discussed theoretical framework which allow one to evaluate the probability of success . in our work",
    "we provide a short derivation of the optimal measurement and explicitly evaluate the probability of success in such measurement .",
    "the aforementioned derivation will guide us in our quest for finding the optimal measurement that would allow us to compare coherent states .    in order to construct the desired povm for the state comparison we first introduce the ( no - error ) condition that guarantees that whenever we obtain the result @xmath13 we can conclude that the states were indeed different : @xmath14=0\\ , .",
    "\\label{noerror1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating uniformly over all pure states @xmath15 we obtain an equivalent no - error condition that reads @xmath16 = { \\rm",
    "tr}[{{\\rm \\pi}}_1 \\delta ] \\ , , \\label{nerorint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the projector onto a completely symmetric subspace of @xmath19 and @xmath5 is the dimension of the hilbert space",
    ". the derivation of the formula ( [ delta ] ) can be found for example in the paper of hayashi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "because of the positivity of the operators @xmath13 and @xmath20 the equation ( [ nerorint ] ) implies that these two operators have orthogonal supports . hence the largest possible support the operator @xmath13 can have is the orthogonal complement to the support of @xmath20 .",
    "the support of the projector @xmath21 is therefore the largest possible support of @xmath13 .",
    "the optimal measurement must maximize the average success probability @xmath22 of revealing the difference between the states that are launched into the comparator @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while keeping the positivity ( @xmath24 ) and the no - error conditions satisfied . combining these two conditions on the support of @xmath13 ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) we obtain @xmath25 .",
    "thus the optimal state comparison of @xmath10 and @xmath11 copies of a pair of an unknown pure states is accomplished by the following projective measurement @xmath26    in what follows we calculate the probability of revealing the difference of the states @xmath2 , @xmath3 measured by the optimal comparator , i.e. @xmath27 \\\\ & = & 1-{\\langle}{\\psi}{| \\psi_s \\rangle } \\ , , \\label{ovlp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the above formulas we denoted by @xmath30 a group of permutations of @xmath31 elements and @xmath32 denotes the state @xmath33 in which subsystems have been permuted via the permutation @xmath34 .",
    "for example , a permutation @xmath35 exchanging only @xmath10-th and @xmath36-th position acts as @xmath37 the state @xmath33 has @xmath31 subsystems defining @xmath31 positions , which are interchanged by the permutation @xmath34 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath38 the subset of the first @xmath10 positions ( originally copies of @xmath2 ) and by @xmath39 the remaining @xmath11 positions ( originally occupied by systems in the state @xmath3 ) . for our purposes it will be useful to characterize each permutation @xmath40 by the number of positions @xmath41 in the subset @xmath38 occupied by subsystems originated from the subset @xmath39 . literally , @xmath42 is the number of states @xmath3 moved into the first @xmath10 subsystems ( @xmath38 ) by the permutation @xmath34 acting on the state @xmath33 . using this number",
    "we can write @xmath43 for instance , @xmath44    in order to evaluate the scalar product @xmath45 we need to calculate the number of permutations @xmath46 with the same value @xmath47 . for each permutation",
    "@xmath34 there are exactly @xmath48 permutations leading to the same state @xmath32 .",
    "the number of different quantum states @xmath49 having the same overlap @xmath50 with the state @xmath33 ( i.e. the same @xmath41 ) is @xmath51 .",
    "this is because each such state is fully specified by enumerating @xmath41 from the first @xmath10 subsystems to which @xmath3 states were permuted and by enumerating @xmath41 from the last @xmath11 subsystems to which @xmath2 states were moved . to sum up our derivation",
    ", we have @xmath52 , and consequently eq .  ( [ sump1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath53 where @xmath54 stands for a completely symmetric subspace of @xmath55 .",
    "thus , we see that the success rate is essentially given by one minus the ratio of dimensionality of the failure subspace to the dimension of the potentially occupied space .",
    "next we will analyze properties of @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , we will study how it behaves as a function of the number @xmath57 of available copies of the two compared states .",
    "we are going to confirm a very natural expectation that any additional copy of one of the compared states always increases the probability of success .",
    "stated mathematically , it suffices to prove that @xmath58 since @xmath59 is symmetric with respect to @xmath57 . for @xmath60 @xmath61 for @xmath62",
    "the additional term @xmath63 appears in the expression for @xmath64 , however it is possible to proceed in the same way in both cases .",
    "we can think of @xmath64 as being a polynomial in @xmath65 , which vanishes for @xmath66 , because @xmath67 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath68 of the polynomial @xmath69 are nonnegative for @xmath70 and negative otherwise .",
    "therefore , we can apply the lemma from appendix b to conclude that @xmath71 for @xmath72 $ ] , which is equivalent to eq.([rast1 ] ) .",
    "we have proved that for any pair of compared states the additional copies of the states improve the probability of success , so the statement holds also for the average success probabilities , i.e. @xmath73      now we consider the situation when the total number @xmath74 of copies of the two states is fixed , i.e. @xmath75 . our aim is to maximize the success probability with respect to the splitting of the @xmath74 systems into @xmath10 copies of the state @xmath2 and @xmath11 copies of the state @xmath3 . in order to find the solution to this problem we prove the following inequality @xmath76 where @xmath77 indicates the floor function , i.e. the integer part of the number .",
    "the previous inequality automatically implies @xmath78 for @xmath79 , because @xmath80 is symmetric in @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , this would mean that the optimal value is @xmath81 .",
    "thus , to complete the proof it is sufficient to confirm the validity of eq .",
    "( [ rast2 ] ) .",
    "this is done in the same way as for eq .",
    "( [ rast1 ] ) i.e. by looking on @xmath82 as on a polynomial in @xmath65 and showing that the assumptions of the lemma from appendix b hold .",
    "hence , given the total number @xmath74 of copies it is most optimal to have half of them in the state @xmath2 and the other half in the state @xmath3 .",
    "in this case the average probability of success @xmath83 is maximized .",

    "( [ ppvo ] ) and ( [ mpd ] ) .",
    "the figure ( [ ppvo ] ) illustrates that the more copies of the compared states we have and the smaller is their overlap , the higher is the probability of revealing the difference between the states .",
    "the overlap of a pair of randomly chosen states decreases with the dimension of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore the mean probability @xmath85 for a fixed number of copies @xmath10 grows with the dimension @xmath5 . this fact is documented in fig . ( [ mpd ] ) .",
    "let us now study the situation when @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in this case",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ prpure ] ) has only two terms , which can be easily evaluated to obtain @xmath88 in this limit the same probability of success can be reached also by a different comparison strategy .",
    "we can first use the state reconstruction techniques to precisely determine the state @xmath3 and then by projecting the remaining @xmath2 state onto @xmath89 reveal the difference between the states .    for the limit , where the number of both compared states goes to infinity simultaneously ( @xmath90 ) , from eq .",
    "( [ dimcnt ] ) we recover for any finite @xmath5 the classical behavior i.e. @xmath91    therefore we can conclude that larger the number of the copies @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the two states higher the probability to determine that the two states are different is .",

    "in any quantum information processing the prior knowledge about the system in which information is encoded plays an important role .",
    "the most explicit example one can name is the state estimation when the prior knowledge about the state is crucial . in what follows",
    "we will analyze the quantum state comparison and instead of assuming that the two compared states are totally arbitrary we will restrict a class of possible states . to be more specific",
    ", we will consider a harmonic oscillator and we focus our attention on comparison of coherent states .",
    "coherent states @xcite are defined as eigenstates of the annihilation operator @xmath92 ( acting on @xmath93 ) associated with eigenvalues taking arbitrary value in the complex plane , i.e. the set of coherent states is defined as @xmath94    our next task is two - fold : firstly we introduce an optimal protocol for comparison of two coherent states .",
    "secondly we propose an experimental realization of the optimal coherent states comparator .",
    "following the same line of reasoning as in the previous section the measurement operator @xmath95 unambiguously revealing that the coherent states ( @xmath10 copies of state @xmath96 and @xmath11 copies of the state @xmath97 ) are different must obey the following `` no - error '' conditions @xmath98=0 \\quad\\forall\\ , { | \\alpha \\rangle } \\in s_{\\rm coh}\\ , , \\label{noerror2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or equivalently @xmath99 = { \\rm tr}[{{\\rm \\pi}}^{\\rm coh}_1 \\delta]\\ , , \\label{nerorint1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is an arbitrary positive measure such that its support contains all coherent states .",

    "the experimental setup we are going to propose will consist of several beam - splitters and only a single photodetector .",
    "a beam - splitter acts on a pair of coherent states in a very convenient way , in particular , the output beams remain unentangled and coherent , i.e. @xmath111 where @xmath112 stand for transmissivity and reflectivity , respectively , and @xmath113 .",

    "namely , they are arranged according to fig .",
    "[ csetup ] and they perform the unitary transformation @xmath116 . to do this the transmissivities of the beam - splitters must be set as follows @xmath117 similarly , @xmath118 beam - splitters are used to `` concentrate '' the @xmath11 copies of the second state .",
    "the `` concentrated '' states @xmath119 , @xmath120 are then launched into the last beam - splitter in which the comparison of input coherent states is performed .",
    "it performs the following unitary transformation @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the reflectivity and transmissivity of the last beam - splitter . to obtain the vacuum in the upper output ( see fig.3 ) we need to adjust the values of reflectivity and transmissivity so that the identity @xmath123 holds , i.e. @xmath124    finally , a photodetector will measure the presence of photons in the upper output port of the last beam - splitter ( see fig .",
    "[ csetup ] ) .",
    "if the two compared states are identical , in the output port we have zero photons - that is this port is in the vacuum state .",
    "therefore a detection of at least one photon unambiguously indicates the difference between the compared states . on the other hand",

    "this result does not depend on the dimension of the system in contrast to the average success rate , which reads @xmath133 given the a priori knowledge that the states are coherent one can increase the probability ( see fig.1 ) to @xmath134 the improvement is significant ( fig.1 ) for small number of copies .",
    "we also addressed the problem of maximizing the success probability providing that the total number of available copies is fixed .",
    "we have shown that it is optimal if the number of copies is the same , i.e. @xmath135 . in the limit of the large number of copies the comparison approach reduces to `` classical '' comparison based on the quantum - state estimation .",

    "this proposal is relatively easy to implement , since it consists only of @xmath136 beam - splitters and a single photodetector .",
    "unfortunately , the success of unambiguous state comparison is very fragile with respect to small imperfections .",
