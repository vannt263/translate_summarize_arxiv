    "tracking a lander on the surface of another planet with radio signals is an efficient way to observe its rotation ( dehant et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "this can be done by measuring the doppler shift of the radio signal between the lander and a large antenna on earth , like the ones of the deep space network ( dsn ) .",
    "we consider here two - way x - band signal : the ground station transmits the radio signal to mars , which is coherently ( i.e.  without any phase shift ) sent back to earth by the transponder onboard the lander .",
    "five martian landers have already been tracked from earth in order to get the martian rotation .",
    "the first landers were the two viking landers in 1976 - 1982 ( see for example borderies et al .",

    "the martian orientation parameters ( mop ) are the nutations , the precession , the length - of - day variations and the polar motion .",
    "the precession is the long - term drift of the rotation axis in space .",
    "nutations are seasonal periodic motions of this axis observed from space , while the polar motion is the seasonal motion of the rotation axis in a frame tied to the planet .",
    "the rotation rate variations , also called length - of - day variations , are the periodic variations of the martian diurnal rotation .",
    "the periods are also the harmonics of the annual period . since these rotational motions depend on the interior structure of mars , in particular the core dimension , density and state , and on the dynamics of the atmosphere and the ice caps and the co@xmath0 sublimation / condensation process , accurate measurements of these angles are very useful because additional constraints on the geophysical models could be provided .    in this paper",
    "we derive expressions of the signature of the rotation parameters in the doppler and range observables .",
    "these expressions are useful in order to optimize the configuration parameters and to anticipate the observation times that maximize the signatures and the geophysical information .",
    "this is of course not only helpful for the insight and exomars mission planning but also for other geodesy experiments on other planets .",

    "we give the analytical expressions of the signature of these mop in the doppler observable and their numerical values , while the section 5 focuses on the signatures in the range observable .",
    "the instantaneous doppler frequency can be interpreted as the space probe radial velocity with respect to the tracking station . as a first order approximation , it is the projection on the line - of - sight of the difference of the velocity vector between the emitter and the receiver .",

    "this is due to the faster revolution velocity of the earth than for mars . at this time , in the earth s sky , mars is having an apparent retrograde motion with respect to the usual planetary rotation . at the same time",
    ", the earth declination shows some irregularities because of this retrograde motion .",
    "the maxima in the earth declination do not correspond to the distance minima because the direction of the martian spin axis has also to be taken into account .",
    "the maxima have a periodicity longer than the earth - mars synodic period ( 780 days ) . on the time scale of a spacecraft mission ( about 2 years )",

    "the nutations for a rigid planet can be computed from celestial mechanics and ephemerides .",
    "a rigid nutation model is usually constructed as a sum of different frequencies with an amplitude and a phase for the nutation in obliquity ( @xmath35 ) and in longitude ( @xmath36 ) . in the following sections , we use the term `` nutation in longitude '' @xmath36 to mean the sum of the components at different frequencies of the nutation in longitude , and similarly the term `` nutation in obliquity '' @xmath35 as the sum of the main frequencies .",
    "for mars , the largest nutations are the annual and semiannual nutations .",
    "their maximal amplitude are about 550 and 1130 mas , corresponding to 9 and 19 m on mars surface .",
    "we use roosbeek ( 1999 ) rigid mars nutations model .",
    "however mars is not a rigid planet .",
    "therefore the nutation amplitudes depend on the interior structure and parameters , like the state ( liquid or solid ) of the core or its moment of inertia .",
    "we can model the non - rigid nutation amplitudes by applying a transfer function to the rigid nutations ( dehant et al .",
    ", 2000 , van hoolst et al . , 2000a , 2000b ) .",
    "this transfer function is based on the model developed for the earth by sasao et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and includes the liquid core effects and other deformation effects .",
    "for example , if the core is liquid , then an additional free mode , the free core nutation ( fcn ) amplifies the nutation response if the fcn period is close to one of the nutation periods .",
    "current interior models estimate the fcn period to be between about -240 and -285 days .",
    "therefore the fcn can mostly enhance the small retrograde terannual ( 229 days ) or the large prograde semiannual nutation ( 343.5 days ) .",
    "considering the 3 sigma interval rather than the 1 sigma interval will make the fcn range larger than @xmath40 days and the fcn frequency can be even closer to the terannual frequency , increasing the amplification . in this study",
    ", we use a transfer function and amplifications computed from up - to - date interior models ( panning et al . , 2016 ) .",
    "the mantle mineralogy and the temperature profile are unique for all the models and the planet is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the variable quantities in the interior models are the size of the core and the density and thickness of the crust .",
    "the models agree with the observed moment of inertia at one sigma .",
    "the frequencies of the nutations are not affected by the transfer function , therefore the modeling we use is a trigonometric expansion with known periods but unknown amplitudes .",
    "the amplifications are different for each nutation period and for the nutation in obliquity and in longitude ( see for example figure 10 of le maistre et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "depending on the size of the core , the maximal change of the nutations due to the liquid core is between @xmath41  mas and @xmath42  mas ( corresponding to about @xmath43  cm and @xmath44  cm on mars surface ) for the nutation in obliquity and between @xmath42  mas and @xmath44  mas or @xmath45  cm and @xmath46  cm for the nutation in longitude .",
    "the lower values correspond to a small core of @xmath47  km while the upper values correspond to a large core of about @xmath48  km .",
    "an important objective of the geodesy experiments is to measure the nutations and particularly the transfer function because it is good tool to constraint the interior structure of mars and the core dimension and density in particular .",
    "+ the precession is the secular motion of the spin axis about the normal to the orbit plane .",
    "the spin axis completes one rotation in a period of about 170 300 years .",

    "<S> the position of a lander on mars surface is affected by different motions : the nutations , the precession , the length - of - day variations and the polar motion . </S>",

    "<S> these expressions are function of the diurnal rotation of mars , the lander position , the planet radius and the rotation parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the nutation signature is proportional to the earth declination with respect to mars . </S>",
    "<S> + for an equatorial lander on mars , the largest signatures in the doppler observable are for the length - of - day variations , precession rate and rigid nutations . the polar motion and the liquid core signatures have a much smaller amplitude . for a lander closer to the pole , </S>",
    "<S> the polar motion signature is enhanced while the other signatures decrease . </S>",
    "<S> + similarly , we derive expressions for the signatures of the rotation parameters in the lander - earth range observable . </S>",
    "<S> + these expressions are useful in order to find when these signatures are maximal during one day or on a longer timescale , therefore to identify the best times to observe with a geodesy experiment , like the ones on - board the future insight or exomars2020 missions . </S>",
