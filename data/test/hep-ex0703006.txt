    "the standard model ( sm ) is a very successful effective theory . over the last few years",
    "it has emerged that the ckm mechanism is likely the dominant mechanism and new physics ( np ) beyond the sm would appear as corrections . if np were observed at the lhc its flavour sector must be studied . here",
    "we discuss the plans for an upgraded lhcb experiment . in section  [ sec : lhcb ] we present the lhcb experiment and physics programme , and motivate running at higher luminosities .",
    "the physics reach of a 100  data sample is discussed in section  [ sec : physics ] for selected key measurements : the @xmath4 mixing phase  from the tree decay @xmath7 , the @xmath8 penguin decay @xmath9 , as well as the ckm angle  @xmath6 . in section  [ sec : detector ] we present the plans for upgrading the lhcb trigger and detectors .",
    "the report ends with conclusions .",
    "the goal of the lhcb experiment is to perform precise measurements of cp violation and rare decays of @xmath10 mesons .",
    "the lhcb detector is a forward arm spectrometer which is equipped with state - of - the - art vertexing capabilities , and is designed to trigger efficiently on muons , electrons and photons as well as hadronic final states .",
    "two ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detectors allow excellent charged particle identification .",
    "the trigger and flavour tagging of lhcb are discussed elsewhere in these proceedings  @xcite .",
    "the lhcb experiment will start taking data in 2007 at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "more details about the current status of lhcb and its first year data - taking plans are described in  @xcite .",
    "the lhcb experiment is designed to operate at a luminosity @xmath11 .",
    "this choice maximises the number of bunch crossings with exactly one @xmath12 interaction and reduces the radiation damage to the vertex detector .",
    "this luminosity is a factor of @xmath13 below the lhc design value which is achievable by using a tunable amplitude function , @xmath14 , at the lhcb interaction point .",
    "therefore this luminosity will very likely be reached during the first lhc physics run . in a nominal year of @xmath15 , a data sample of @xmath16",
    "will be collected by lhcb .    [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the large cross section of @xmath17b for",
    "the production of @xmath18-quark pairs at the lhc will allow lhcb to collect much larger data samples of selected @xmath10 meson decays than previously available .",
    "the sensitivities of these data - sets to cp violating asymmetries and to other physics observables have been studied with simulated events . in table",
    "[ tab : sensitivities ] we present a selection of signal yields @xmath19 , background to signal ratios @xmath20 and precisions on ckm angles @xmath6 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath5 and other observables .",
    "detailed presentations on many of the channels are presented elsewhere in these proceedings  @xcite .",
    "the plan is to operate the lhcb experiment for five years at the design luminosity and to collect a data sample of @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "a major goal is to exploit the physics in the @xmath25 system .",
    "this includes the observation of cp violation in @xmath25 mesons and precision measurements of the mass difference between the @xmath4 mass eigenstates , @xmath26 , and the lifetime difference @xmath27 .",
    "other main aims are to improve the error on the ckm angle  @xmath6 by a factor of five , to probe np in rare @xmath10 meson decays with electroweak , radiative and hadronic penguin modes , and to make the first observation of the very rare decay @xmath28 .",
    "after the first five years of operation , the precision of many lhcb physics results will remain limited by the statistical error of the collected data .",
    "the following questions arise : is lhcb exploiting the full potential for @xmath10 physics at hadron colliders and is there a science case for collecting even larger data samples ?",
    "note that lhcb is the only dedicated heavy flavour experiment approved to run after 2010 . in the remainder of this report",
    "we will try to answer these questions .",
    "the lhcb experiment has commenced studying the feasibility of upgrading the detector such that it can operate at a luminosity @xmath29 , which is ten times larger than the design luminosity .",
    "this upgrade would allow lhcb to collect a data sample of about @xmath30 during five years of running .",
    "this increased luminosity is achievable by decreasing @xmath14 at the lhcb interaction point .",
    "it does not require a lhc luminosity upgrade ( super - lhc ) as the lhc design luminosity is @xmath31 although it could operate at super - lhc .",
    "thus an upgrade of lhcb could be implemented as early as 2013 .",
    "the number of interactions per beam crossing will increase to @xmath32 which will require improvements to the lhcb sub - detectors and trigger .",
    "flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) are particularly sensitive to np .",
    "new particles appear virtually in loop diagrams which lead to deviations from sm predictions .",
    "the interference in @xmath4 mixing and decay to cp eigenstates is sensitive to the cp violating weak mixing phase @xmath5 .",
    "this can be studied in the time - dependent asymmetry of flavour - tagged  decays .",
    "the sm prediction for @xmath5 is very small : @xmath34rad where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the usual wolfenstein parameters of the ckm matrix  @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath5 is a very sensitive probe of np and will provide a stringent test for non - minimal flavour violation ( nmfv )  @xcite .",
    "currently the only direct  result is from d0 who measure @xmath37rad in the untagged decay time spectrum of  decays  @xcite . using a full simulation , the lhcb experiment expects to collect 131k  decays with a 2  data sample  @xcite .",
    "the expected precision on  is estimated with many toy monte carlo experiments based on the yields and resolutions obtained in the full simulation .",
    "we obtain @xmath38rad where the  mass difference has been set to @xmath39 . new physics in @xmath4",
    "mixing can be parameterised as @xmath40 where the sm phase of @xmath41 is equal to @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are , respectively , the amplitude and the phase of the np contribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hsss ] we show the expected sensitivity for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for lhcb with 2  of data  @xcite .    with five years of data , lhcb expects to achieve a precision of @xmath45rad which corresponds to about a @xmath46 significance for the sm value of .",
    "this precision is expected to be statistically limited , with systematic errors likely to be much smaller .",
    "the precision of the sm prediction for  is better than 0.01rad .    a significantly larger data - set would allow lhcb to probe new physics in @xmath10 mesons at an unprecedented level of a few percent . here",
    "we present estimates for sensitivities with a 100  data sample which are based on scaling with luminosity .",
    "potential trigger efficiency improvements are not included .",
    "while these estimates have large uncertainties , these are extremely useful to motivate simulation studies with the aim to improve or at least maintain trigger and selection efficiencies at ten times higher luminosities .",
    "an upgrade of lhcb has the potential to measure the sm value of   with @xmath47 precision ( @xmath48rad ) in  decays .",
    "new physics can be probed by studying fcncs in hadronic @xmath49 transitions .",
    "one approach is to compare the time - dependent cp asymmetry in a hadronic penguin loop decay , where unknown massive particles could enter with a decay based on a tree diagram which generally is insensitive to np and which has the same weak phase .",
    "the b - factories measure the cp asymmetry @xmath50 in the penguin decay . a value for @xmath50 which is different from @xmath51 measured in  would signal physics beyond the sm . within the current available precision ,",
    "all @xmath50 measurements are in reasonable agreement with the sm , but all central values are lower than expected .",
    "a naive average indicates a @xmath52 discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "the above approach can also be applied to  mesons and this will be exploited by lhcb . within the sm",
    "the weak mixing phase  is expected to be almost the same when comparing the time - dependent cp asymmetry of the hadronic penguin decay  with the tree decay . due to a cancellation of the @xmath25 mixing and decay phase ,",
    "the sm prediction for  is actually very close to zero  @xcite .",
    "thus any measurement of @xmath53 is a clear signal for nmfv .",
    "lhcb expects to collect 1.2k  decays in 2  of data  @xcite . by comparing with the  yield we estimate a sensitivity of @xmath54rad for 10  of data",
    "this  precision is statistically limited . scaling the sensitivity up to a data sample of 100   we estimate a precision of @xmath55rad .",
    "this sensitivity presents a very precise and exciting np probe .",
    "a first - level detached vertex trigger is required to reconstruct this hadronic decay mode .",
    "a new lhcb simulation study on   can be found in  @xcite .",
    "lhcb will perform direct measurements of the ckm angle  @xmath6 using two interfering tree processes in neutral and charged  decays .",
    "the interference arises due to decays which are common to @xmath56 and @xmath57 mesons such as @xmath58 ( dalitz decay  @xcite ) and @xmath59 ( ads and glw  @xcite ) .",
    "the current combined direct @xmath6 measurements at the @xmath10 factories have large errors of about 30  @xcite .",
    "the expected lhcb @xmath6 sensitivities for 2  of data have been estimated for several of the above modes  @xcite ; we obtain @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , lhcb will use the decay   to measure @xmath6 with @xmath61 in 2  . by combining these measurements",
    ", lhcb will achieve a precision of @xmath62 in 2  .",
    "the theoretical error on the sm prediction is very small .",
    "note that some of the @xmath6 measurements will have a correlated systematic error , for example there is a dalitz model dependence .",
    "we take this into account when scaling to a 100  data sample and estimate that a precision of @xmath63 should be achievable .",
    "this would allow a very precise determination of the apex of the unitarity triangle .",
    "we presented a selection of key measurements that could be performed with an upgrade of the lhcb experiment , namely precision measurements of the weak mixing phase  in tree decays and @xmath8 transitions , and of the ckm angle  @xmath6 .",
    "many more measurements would also benefit from a ten - fold increase in statistics . with 100  of data",
    ", lhcb would be able measure @xmath64 in  with an estimated precision of @xmath65 .",
    "an estimated yield of 44k  events per year would allow probing right - handed currents by analysing forward - backward asymmetries ( @xmath66 ) and transversity angles .",
    "in addition , the lhcb upgrade would allow the probeing of np in charm decays and to study lepton flavour violation in @xmath67 decays .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] we present a comparison of the expected sensitivities for the lhcb upgrade , scaled from 10 to 100  , with sensitivities at a super - b factory based on a @xmath68 data sample  @xcite .",
    "both approaches have comparable sensitivities for many measurements such as @xmath6 and @xmath69 .",
    "lhcb will be limited in reconstructing decays with ( more than one ) neutral final state particles ( photon , @xmath70 or @xmath36 ) .",
    "however only an upgrade of the lhcb experiment will allow an ultimate exploitation of  meson decays .",
    "while these estimates need to be confirmed with simulations at high luminosities , an excellent science case can be written for an lhcb upgrade .",
    "the trigger for the lhcb experiment comprises a first level trigger ( l0 ) implemented in hardware and a higher level trigger ( hlt ) running on a large cpu farm .",
    "the l0 trigger operates at 40 mhz and selects high transverse momentum objects in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters ( @xmath71 , @xmath6 , charged hadrons ) and muons in the muon system ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) .",
    "pile - up events are vetoed .",
    "the output rate is limited to 1.1 mhz with @xmath74 latency .",
    "simulations show that the l0 muon trigger efficiency for reconstructable events is around 90% and that the output rate scales with luminosity up to @xmath75 . at the design luminosity , the l0 hadron trigger efficiencies are about 40% , and the output rate increases only slightly with luminosity .",
    "the vertex detector ( velo ) sensors  @xcite undergo radiation damage and it is expected that these will need to be replaced when 6 to 8  of luminosity has been collected .",
    "this illustrates that the existing trigger and at least some of the sub - detector systems will not allow operating the lhcb experiment at ten times the design luminosity .",
    "we have commenced studies which investigate how to upgrade the lhcb detector and triggers such that the experiment can operate at luminosities @xmath76 .",
    "two scenarios are under consideration",
    ". a step - by - step approach would foresee to replace the velo sensors with improved radiation - hard detectors which will be read out at 40 mhz .",
    "this would allow the addition of a first - level detached vertex trigger at l0 .",
    "the trigger tracker in front of the lhcb dipole magnet could also be included .",
    "this trigger could be implemented in fpgas , and it would need to be very fast and run within the l0 latency time .",
    "other lhcb detector systems will also need to be upgraded when increasing the luminosity , either due to unacceptably large occupancies or radiation effects .",
    "we are currently studying the luminosity limit of each lhcb sub - detector system .",
    "under discussion is the replacement of the central region of the rich1 photon detectors , an increase ( decrease ) of the inner ( outer ) tracker area , and a replacement of the inner region of the electromagnetic calorimeter",
    ".    another approach would be to change the read - out of all lhcb sub - detectors to 40  mhz .",
    "this has clear advantages as it would allow the implementation of a l0 displaced vertex trigger in a cpu farm .",
    "in fact all trigger decisions would be software - based which allows flexibility .",
    "however this approach requires a redesign of the front - end electronics which has implications for all sub - detector systems . besides the velo",
    ", all silicon sensors of the trigger and inner tracker and the rich photon detectors would need to be replaced .",
    "the r&d for the new front - end electronics will be able to profit from the developments of atlas and cms for super - lhc luminosities .",
    "r&d efforts have started on technologies for radiation - hard vertex detectors that will be able to operate in the radiation environments of the lhc and lhcb upgrade .",
    "the detector sensors will need to be able to operate at radiation doses of about @xmath77 .",
    "initial studies of czochralski and @xmath78-on-@xmath79 sensors irradiated up to @xmath80 24 gev protons/@xmath81 are promising and show that the charge collection efficiencies saturate at acceptable bias voltages  @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional sensors are another alternative that could be investigated .    two different vertex - detector geometries are envisaged .",
    "one is to shorten the strips , the other is to use pixels . removing the rf foil that separates the velo sensors from the primary beam - pipe vacuum would reduce the radiation length before the first measurement by 3% and improve the proper time resolution of @xmath10 meson decays .",
    "a preliminary study uses  decays simulated at a luminosity of @xmath82 .",
    "events with large numbers of interactions are employed to simulate larger effective luminosities up to @xmath83 . in a first step",
    ", the existing hlt velo trigger algorithm is added without modifications into the l0 trigger .",
    "we find that the minimum bias rate keeps rising with luminosity and saturates the bandwidth well below our target luminosity .",
    "a better approach is to combine the l0 trigger with a detached vertex trigger and to read out at a 40mhz rate . we require a transverse energy @xmath84 from the hadron trigger and combine this with a matched track that has a transverse momentum @xmath85 gev/@xmath86 and an impact parameter @xmath87 . in this combined trigger",
    "the minimum bias rate does not depend strongly on the luminosity and the triggered event yield scales linearly with the luminosity .",
    "in addition , the total trigger efficiency is 60% larger when compared with the existing baseline .",
    "we have presented a plan to upgrade the lhcb experiment after about five years of running .",
    "this programme is motivated by new physics beyond the standard model that can be studied with a ten times larger data sample .",
    "the lhcb upgrade would allow a precise measurement the weak mixing phase   at its standard model value and to probe new physics in @xmath10 meson decays at an unprecedented level of a few percent or better .",
    "initial estimates show that an excellent science case can be developed .",
    "the plan is to upgrade the lhcb detector such that it can operate at ten times the design luminosity , i.e. at @xmath76 .",
    "the upgraded experiment can run with or without an lhc luminosity upgrade .",
    "the lhcb upgrade will require a first - level detached vertex trigger . to achieve this",
    ", the vertex detector sensors will need to be replaced and many other sub - systems will need to be improved .",
