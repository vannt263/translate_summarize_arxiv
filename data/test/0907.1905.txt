    "in [ 18 ] tierney and vogel for any functor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a category with finite limits and with a projective class @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is an abelian category , have constructed derived functors and investigated relationships of their theory with other theories of derived functors .",
    "namely , they have shown that if @xmath1 is abelian and @xmath4 is additive , then their theory coincides with the classical relative theory of eilenberg - moore [ 7 ] , whereas if @xmath1 is abelian and @xmath4 is an arbitrary functor , then it gives a generalization of the theory of dold - puppe [ 6 ] . besides , they showed that their derived functors are naturally isomorphic to the cotriple derived functors of barr - beck [ 3 ] if there is a cotriple in @xmath1 that realizes the given projective class @xmath2 .",
    "the key point in the construction of the derived functors by tierney and vogel is that , using @xmath2-projective objects and simplicial kernels , for every @xmath5 from @xmath1 a @xmath2-projective resolution can be constructed , which is an @xmath5-augmented pseudosimplicial object in @xmath1 and which for a given @xmath5 is unique up to a presimplicial homotopy ( according to the comparison theorem for @xmath2-projective resolutions ) .",
    "a natural question arises about constructing a cubical analog of the theory of tierney and vogel .",
    "exactly this is the purpose of this paper .    before turning to the content of the paper itself ,",
    "let us say few words about cubical objects and techniques .",
    "as it is well known , simplicial methods are developed for long time and are successfully used in algebra and topology . with less success , but still also cubical techniques have been developed , which was initiated on one hand by the systematic use of singular cubes in the singular homology theory of topological spaces ( see , for example , [ 14 ] ) , and , on the other hand , by the papers of kan [ 12 , 13 ] which have related cubical sets to homotopy theory .",
    "further research ( see e.  g. [ 1,2,4,5,8 - 11,16,17,19 ] ) has also shown that the cubical approach is interesting and important .",
    "cubical objects have a number of advantages compared to the simplicial ones .",
    "for example , a ( pre)cubical homotopy is given by a single morphism in each dimension , whereas a ( pre)simplicial homotopy requires `` many '' morphisms . on the other hand ,",
    "significant disadvantages of the cubical technique with respect to the simplicial one are also apparent .",
    "for example , a cubical group , in fact even a cubical abelian group , can fail to satisfy the kan condition [ 16,17 ] . in the context of elimination of these and other disadvantages of the cubical theory , of extreme importance",
    "are cubical objects with connections introduced by brown and higgins [ 4 ] .",
    "these objects are cubical objects with extra degeneracies , called connections .",
    "to stress importance and naturality of cubical objects with connections it suffices to name e.  g. the following three facts .",
    "the singular cubical complex of any topological space has naturally defined connections .",
    "next , tonks in [ 19 ] has shown that any cubical group with connections satisfies the kan condition .",
    "finally , brown and higgins [ 5 ] have recently proved that the category of cubical objects with connections in an abelian category is equivalent to the category of nonnegative chain complexes in the same category .    in this paper",
    "we introduce pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections , obtained from the brown - higgins structure of a cubical object with connections by suitably relaxing their identities .",
    "projective precubical resolutions which we are using to construct cubical derived functors possess pseudodegeneracies and pseudoconnections and this fact is essentially used in the construction of derived functors defined by us .",
    "now let us list the contents of the paper by sections .",
    "in section [ prelim ] we recall the notions of presimplicial , pseudosimplicial and simplicial objects , precubical , cubical objects and cubical objects with connections , their morphisms , and the respective augmented versions of these notions .",
    "we also recall the definitions of normalization functors in the simplicial setting by moore , and in the cubical setting by wiatek [ 16 ] .",
    "furthermore we recall the kan cubical sets and their homotopy groups .    for any presimplicial object @xmath6 in an abelian category @xmath1 the normalized chain complex of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath7 in this paper , is a chain subcomplex of the unnormalized chain complex of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the well known moore theorem says that if @xmath6 is a simplicial object in @xmath1 , then this inclusion is a chain homotopy equivalence ( in fact this is valid for any pseudosimplicial object in @xmath1 ) . on the other hand , for any precubical object @xmath9 in an abelian category @xmath1 , one has the canonical inclusion @xmath10 of chain complexes @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath1 which are cubical analogs of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see [ 16 , 17 ] ) respectively , and which functorially depend on @xmath9 . in section 2",
    "we introduce pseudocubical objects with pseudoconnections and prove that @xmath13 is a chain homotopy equivalence for any pseudocubical object @xmath9 with pseudoconnections ( in particular for any cubical object @xmath9 with connections ) .",
    "thus we obtain a cubical analog of the moore theorem .",
    "then we establish some results which are not needed later on ; however they seem interesting by themselves .",
    "let us mention some of them .",
    "we indicate an alternative proof of the aforementioned brown - higgins equivalence . furthermore , we point out that this equivalence is realized by the above functor @xmath14 .",
    "next , we show that if @xmath15 is a kan cubical group , then @xmath16 , the @xmath17-th homotopy group of @xmath15 , coincides with @xmath18 , the @xmath17-th homology group of @xmath19 ( note that @xmath19 and @xmath18 are defined for any cubical group @xmath15 as well ) . using this and the cubical analog of the moore theorem together with the aforementioned result of tonks",
    ", we get that @xmath16 is naturally isomorphic to @xmath20 for any cubical abelian group @xmath15 with connections .",
    "let @xmath1 be a category with finite limits and a projective class @xmath2 , @xmath3 an abelian category , and @xmath0 an arbitrary ( covariant ) finctor . in section 3",
    "we construct left cubical derived functors @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , as follows .",
    "first we show how to build for any object @xmath5 from @xmath1 an @xmath5-augmented @xmath2-projective precubical resolution , denoted @xmath24 , by means of cubical kernels and @xmath2-projective objects",
    ". then we prove the comparison theorem which in particular says that @xmath24 is unique up to precubical homotopy for a given @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that any @xmath2-projective precubical resolution @xmath24 is in fact an augmented pseudocubical object with pseudoconnections .",
    "we define @xmath25 , @xmath23 , to be the @xmath17-th homology of @xmath26 .",
    "besides the comparison theorem , the fact that @xmath27 has pseudodegeneracies is crucial in proving that @xmath25 are well - defined and functorially depend on @xmath5 .",
    "this contrasts with the construction of the derived functors by tierney and vogel which does not use existence of pseudodegeneracies in @xmath2-projective presimplicial resolutions ( pseudodegeneracies of @xmath2-projective presimplicial resolutions are essentially used when the theory of tierney and vogel is compared with other theories of derived functors ) .",
    "further , we define @xmath28 , @xmath23 , to be the @xmath17-th homology group of @xmath29 .",
    "now this construction essentially uses the fact that @xmath27 is a pseudocubical object with pseudoconnections , i.  e. , this is crucial for proving that @xmath30 are well - defined and functorial in @xmath5 .",
    "the cubical analog of the moore theorem proved in the previous section shows that in fact there are isomorphisms @xmath31 , @xmath23 , which are natural in @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is an abelian category with a projective class @xmath2 , @xmath3 an abelian category , and @xmath0 an additive ( covariant ) functor .",
    "then one constructs , with respect to @xmath2 , the left derived functors @xmath32 ( @xmath23 ) of @xmath4 in the sense of eilenberg - moore [ 7 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "since any abelian category admits finite limits , we can build @xmath2-projective precubical resolutions , and therefore can construct the cubical left derived functors @xmath33 , @xmath23 . in section 4 , using once again the cubical analog of the moore theorem , we prove that if @xmath2 is closed [ 7 ] or , more generally , is closed with respect to retracts , then there are isomorphisms @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath23 , which are natural in @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
