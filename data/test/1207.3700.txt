    "the mechanisms behind thermalization have recently attracted a renewed interest and initiated the development of novel statistical formulations of equilibration in the realm of quantum mechanics @xcite . in all these descriptions",
    "the total system under investigation is associated with a finite dimensional hilbert space and thus the asymptotic limit of the dynamics does not exist and the system returns , with possibly very long recurrence time , arbitrarily close to its initial state infinitely many times @xcite .",
    "relaxation to equilibrium in the usual sense is thus impossible .",
    "nevertheless , one can introduce an extended notion of equilibration if the system tends towards some state , which can be identified as equilibrium state of the dynamics , and stays close to it most of the time .",
    "there will still be some fluctuations around the equilibrium state , but extremely small or rare .    in this work we consider the situation in which a closed quantum system can be decomposed into two parts , an open system @xmath0 and a bath @xmath1 , and",
    "investigate the equilibration properties of the subsystem @xmath0 .",
    "we use the extended notion of equilibration , i.e , we will say that the open system equilibrates if its time evolved state ( also called reduced state ) @xmath2 approaches some equilibrium state and spends most of the time close to it . in the same spirit , one can introduce the notion of thermalization of the open system by means of additional conditions on its equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "namely , one requires that the latter does not depend on the initial total state , beside a possible dependence on macroscopic parameters , such as temperature , characterizing the initial state of the bath . in this case",
    "one says that the open system thermalizes if , in addition , the equilibrium state takes the form of a gibbs state .",
    "the capability of an open system to thermalize ultimately traces back to specific properties of the total hamiltonian , which fixes the evolution of the total closed system and , in particular , characterizes the interaction between the open system and the bath .",
    "indeed , if the open system and the bath do not interact no thermalization is expected . moreover ,",
    "if there are conserved quantities for the open system its equilibrium state will unavoidably depend on the initial reduced state .",
    "more generally , it has been shown @xcite that the lack of a sufficient amount of entanglement in the energy eigenbasis is a basic reason for the absence of thermalization .    here",
    ", we want to discuss the thermalization of open quantum systems within the above - mentioned framework , with the aim of clarifying the role of general dynamical mechanisms that can induce or prevent it .",
    "apart from the obvious situation of conserved quantities for the open system , which features of the dynamics imply a dependence of the equilibrium state on the initial reduced state ?",
    "thermalization requires a sufficient amount of entanglement in the energy eigenbasis , but what is the role played by the interaction induced correlations between the open system and the bath ?",
    "we investigate how the equilibrium state is modified when one resets the correlations between the system and the bath , as well as the environmental state , to their initial value .",
    "we find that small system - environment correlations , together with small changes in the environmental state , generally lead to an equilibrium state that hardly depends on the initial state of the open system .",
    "the system - environment correlations built by the dynamics thus play a role which is in a sense opposite to that of the entanglement in the energy eigenbasis .",
    "the interaction induced correlations can prevent the thermalization : strong system - environment correlations and changes in the environmental state allow to distinguish between equilibrium states corresponding to different initial states .",
    "the information about the initial state of the reduced system , transferred to the environment through the establishment of correlations , does influence the equilibrium state . in this sense",
    "it can be considered as trapped in the equilibrium state . for this reason",
    ", we will refer to this mechanism preventing thermalization as _",
    "information trapping_. the quantitative characterization of information trapping will be given in terms of trace distance , which measures the distinguishability between quantum states @xcite and has already been used to detect through its variation the information flow between system and environment @xcite , as also discussed later on .",
    "consider a finite dimensional hilbert space , which can be decomposed as @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 hilbert spaces associated with the open system @xmath0 and the bath @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "a crucial assumption here is that the total hilbert space @xmath6 has finite dimension , which will be denoted by @xmath7 , while we denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 the dimensions of the open system and the bath .",
    "the evolution of the total system is governed by a one - parameter group of unitary operators @xmath10 , which is fixed by the total hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the free hamiltonian of the system and the bath , and @xmath14 is the interaction term .",
    "moreover , assume a product initial total state , so that , for a fixed initial state of the bath , there is a well - defined reduced dynamics @xcite , i.e. there is a family of completely positive and trace preserving maps @xmath15 on the set @xmath16 of statistical operators on @xmath4 such that the reduced state @xmath2 at time @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 : @xmath20 in @xcite it has been shown that an open system equilibrates under very general assumptions if the effective dimension of the bath , i.e. the dimension of the subspace of @xmath5 involved into the dynamics , is much larger than the open - system dimension @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", for any initial state @xmath21 , the corresponding time evolved state @xmath2 will be most of the time close to the time averaged state @xmath22 , which is defined as @xmath23 and represents the equilibrium state of the reduced dynamics .",
    "note that throughout the whole paper we will use an overline to denote the time average of any operator or function .",
    "more precisely , if the total hamiltonian has nondegenerate energy gaps , the average distance between @xmath2 and the time averaged state @xmath22 is bounded by @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the effective dimension of the bath . here and in the following",
    "we characterize the distance between quantum states by means of the trace distance . given two quantum states @xmath26 and @xmath27 , their trace distance is defined as @xmath28 where the trace norm is considered .",
    "the upper bound in ( [ eq : ww ] ) , which has been proven in @xcite for a pure product initial state , can be easily extended to a mixed product initial state , see appendix a.    on that account , the open system equilibrates under very general conditions , but nevertheless , despite some significant results @xcite , it is still a widely open question which are the conditions that determine whether an open system , besides equilibrating , thermalizes . in the following , we will focus on this issue and , in particular , on finding conditions on the dependence of the time averaged state on the initial state of the open system .",
    "first of all , let us take a closer look at the time averaged state defined in ( [ eq : ta ] ) . in the following , we assume for simplicity a non degenerate hamiltonian @xmath29 , but analogous considerations can be done in the degenerate case . for a fully generic initial total state @xmath30 , one has @xmath31 where the notation @xmath32 has been introduced .",
    "if the initial total state is a product state @xmath33 , with fixed environmental state @xmath34 , equation ( [ eq : ta2 ] ) defines a map @xmath35 on the state space of the open system @xmath16 : @xmath36 that can also be written as @xmath37 with @xmath38 this map associates to any initial state of the system the corresponding time averaged state , and therefore we will call it the _ time averaging map_. this is a linear , trace preserving and completely positive map and its image @xmath39 can be identified as the set of equilibrium states of the reduced dynamics .",
    "a state @xmath21 will be said to be invariant if it is left unchanged by the time averaging map , i.e. if @xmath40 .",
    "a natural question is then whether equilibrium states are invariant , i.e. , if , given a state @xmath41 for some initial state @xmath21 , one has @xmath42 .",
    "this can happen for any @xmath43 if and only if the map @xmath35 is a projector .",
    "that is , it satisfies the idempotence relation @xmath44 , where of course @xmath45 indicates the composition of @xmath35 with itself .",
    "note that @xmath46 let us now make the following important remark .",
    "first , recall that any trace preserving and positive map @xmath47 is a contraction for the trace distance @xcite , i.e. @xmath48 for any @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "a map is further said to be _ strictly contractive _",
    "@xcite if @xmath49 for any @xmath50 . indeed , the time averaging map @xmath35 is contractive , but in general not strictly contractive .",
    "it is clear that the only way for it to be both strictly contractive and idempotent is to map every initial state to the same time averaged state .",
    "that is , the maps @xmath51 defined as @xmath52 for a fixed state @xmath53 , are the only idempotent and strictly contractive maps on @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , let @xmath54 be two elements of the image of @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath55 and @xmath56 for some @xmath57 .",
    "the idempotence of @xmath35 implies that @xmath58 and , because of the strict contractivity , it follows that @xmath59 .",
    "hence the image of @xmath35 consists of only a single element which proves our claim .    as a consequence ,",
    "the dependence of the equilibrium state on the initial state of the system can be always related to the violation of either property . in other words , the absence of thermalization can always be associated with either the lack of idempotence or strict contractivity of the time averaging map . in the following",
    "we will focus on the violation of the idempotence of @xmath35 , which will be referred to as _ information trapping_. this will be shown to capture an interesting dependence of the equilibrium state on the initial state , and we will demonstrate a connection between information trapping and the creation of correlations between the system and the bath due to their mutual interaction .      rather than simply assessing whether the time averaging map is idempotent , one needs to quantify its possible deviation from idempotence in order to point out if this can be treated as `` small '' .",
    "the very definition of the equilibration of a quantum system interacting with a finite dimensional bath involves the idea that the reduced state @xmath2 will stay most of the time in a neighborhood of the corresponding equilibrium state @xmath60 . for the sake of concreteness ,",
    "let us denote as @xmath61 the radius of such neighborhood .",
    "now , if the distance between two different equilibrium states @xmath62 and @xmath63 is smaller than @xmath61 , the corresponding time evolved states @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be close to each other for almost all times , so that one can not practically infer that they approach different equilibrium states by monitoring their evolution .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that it is more meaningful to investigate the amount of information trapping of a given dynamics , rather than its mere presence .",
    "in particular , we propose the following measure for information trapping : @xmath66 this directly quantifies the violation of the idempotence of @xmath35 , and it is indeed equal to @xmath67 if and only if @xmath35 is idempotent . in appendix b , we introduce an alternative , but qualitatively equivalent , measure . now , if @xmath68 exceeds @xmath61 , there is some @xmath21 such that one can actually determine that @xmath21 and @xmath60 evolve to different equilibrium states and no thermalization occurs .",
    "in addition , as will be shown by means of examples , the measure @xmath68 provides a useful way to describe how the different features of a given dynamics can enhance or decrease the information trapping and thus the dependence of the equilibrium state on the initial state of the open system .",
    "in this section , we explicitly connect the notion of information trapping with the interaction induced correlations between the system and the bath , as well as the changes in the environmental state .",
    "first of all , it is useful to come back to the full unitary dynamics , where the time averaging can be described by means of a trace preserving and completely positive map @xmath69 , such that ( compare with ( [ eq : ta2 ] ) ) , @xmath70 indeed , this map can be defined for any initial total state , but we will focus on the case @xmath71 , with fixed @xmath34 , to guarantee the existence of the reduced map @xmath35 , which can be expressed as @xmath72 in the following diagram one can see the relation between the map @xmath69 on the total system and both the reduced time averaging map @xmath35 and its two - fold application @xmath45 : @xmath73 where we introduced the notation @xmath74 to indicate the time averaged state of the total system , so that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the time averaged states of the system and the bath , respectively . in particular , note how the reduced map @xmath45 is obtained after resetting the total state from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",
    "now , the map @xmath69 on the total state is always idempotent , i.e. , @xmath79 , as can be easily checked by means of ( [ eq : tau ] ) , since it amounts to a von neumann measurement of the total energy . introducing the map @xmath80 , from the diagram ( [ eq : dia ] ) and the idempotence of @xmath69 , one has @xmath81 , while @xmath82 . but",
    "then , since @xmath83 is trace preserving and completely positive , the contractivity of the trace distance implies @xmath84 the information trapping is upper bounded by the total amount of correlations between the system and the bath in the total time averaged state @xmath77 plus the distinguishability between the time averaged state of the bath @xmath85 and the fixed initial state @xmath34 .",
    "this means that , while a small amount of entanglement in the energy eigenbasis prevents a full thermalization @xcite , such phenomenon will be generally favored if the dynamics builds up a small amount of correlations between the system and the bath , together with small changes in the state of the bath .    from a physical point of view , we can explain the connection between information trapping and system - environment correlations by taking advantage of the notion of information flow associated with the changes of the trace distance between reduced states in the course of time @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that if there is some information trapped into the open system when it approaches the equilibrium , then , by resetting the system - environment correlations as well as the bath state to their initial condition , see ( [ eq : dia ] ) , one can restart an information flow between the system and the bath , thus leading the system to a different equilibrium state .",
    "the distinguishability between the new equilibrium state @xmath86 and @xmath87 then provides a way to quantify the information trapped into the open system due to the system - environment correlations and the changes in the environmental state .",
    "the relevance of bounds , determined by correlations in the total state as well as different environmental states , for the trace distance among different system states has been first pointed out in @xcite , where the time dependence of the trace distance has been related to the presence of initial correlations . here",
    "however the different system states do not correspond to different initial conditions , but rather to the action of distinct mappings .",
    "as a first representative example , consider a product energy eigenbasis @xcite , @xmath88 for such an hamiltonian any reduced observable of the form @xmath89 represents a conserved quantity .",
    "note that a non degenerate conserved quantity on the open system implies a product eigenbasis of the total hamiltonian . for @xmath90 as in ( [ eq : hk1k2 ] ) , the time averaging map is not strictly contractive .",
    "in fact , one has @xmath91 implying that if we choose as initial states two different elements of the basis @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we get @xmath95 on the other hand , for a product energy eigenbasis there is no information trapping , since the time averaging map is a projection .",
    "even more , as it clearly appears from the expression of the time averaged state ( [ eq : k1k2 ] ) , by setting @xmath78 as initial total state , the reduced system does not evolve at all .",
    "this clearly shows that , unlike violation of strict contractivity , information trapping describes a mechanism preventing thermalization which is not merely due to conserved quantities of the open system .",
    "moreover , for a product energy eigenbasis , the total time averaged state is a product state , i.e. @xmath96 , but in general the time averaged state of the bath @xmath85 will be different from the initial state @xmath34 : @xmath97 nevertheless , we have just shown that @xmath98 for any @xmath21 , whichever the value @xmath99 in equation ( [ eq : bbb ] ) . indeed ,",
    "inequality ( [ eq : bb ] ) gives an upper bound to the amount of information trapping which implies that it may well happen that , despite strong system - environment correlations or changes in the environmental state , the equilibrium state presents no information trapping .",
    "let us now consider the jaynes - cummings model , i.e. a two - level system interacting under the rotating wave approximation with a single mode of the radiation field .",
    "moreover , the latter is initially in a thermal state , so that the effective dimension of the bath can be made arbitrarily large by properly increasing the bath temperature .",
    "indeed , this model is much simpler than systems with a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom @xcite or many - body systems @xcite , which are usually taken into account when studying thermalization in the quantum setting . in this context , the jaynes - cummings model can be seen as a toy model , which allows us to explicitly evaluate all the quantities presented in the previous sections .",
    "we emphasize , however , that our general analysis can be applied to any open system , the only requirements being that the dimension of the total hilbert space is finite , and that the open system and the bath are initially uncorrelated .",
    "the hamiltonian giving the total dynamics is @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the raising and lowering operators of the two - level system , while the creation and annihilation operators of the field mode , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , obey the standard bosonic commutation relation .",
    "finally , @xmath105 is the coupling constant and we will denote by @xmath106 the detuning between the frequency @xmath107 of the atom and the frequency @xmath108 of the field mode .",
    "moreover , one can think of an high - energy cutoff in order to keep the dimension of the bath finite .",
    "for an initial total state @xmath71 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the thermal state of the bath , the reduced state at time @xmath17 is given by @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 with @xmath113 , the number operator @xmath114 and @xmath115 .\\ ] ] the time average can be directly calculated , thus giving @xmath116 with @xmath117 from ( [ eq : tajc ] ) one has @xmath118 so that @xmath44 if and only if @xmath119 or @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the latter case corresponds to @xmath122 , which implies , as expected from the discussion in section ( [ sec : pei ] ) , that there is no strict contractivity , see equation ( [ eq : rhot ] ) , and @xmath35 is idempotent . in all the other situations",
    "one has @xmath123 and the map is strictly contractive .",
    "moreover , since for @xmath124 , @xmath125 , the only possibility to have @xmath119 is actually the resonant situation , @xmath126 . in this case",
    "the derivation of @xmath127 through equation ( [ eq : ab ] ) has to be performed quite carefully .",
    "one can take the limit @xmath128 into the function the series in ( [ eq : ab ] ) converges to , or equivalently note that @xmath129 , so that for @xmath130 one has @xmath131 thus , we have @xmath132 , meaning that , apart from the trivial case , in this model there is always information trapping and there never is only one equilibrium state .",
    "we can now characterize the dependence of the equilibrium state of the open system on its initial state by means of the measure for information trapping introduced in equation ( [ eq : t1 ] ) of section ( [ sec : mit ] ) : @xmath133 where the maximum is assumed for @xmath134 .",
    "note that from ( [ eq : alim ] ) one has for @xmath126 @xmath135 in figure ( [ fig:1 ] ) , we have plotted the measure @xmath68 as a function of the detuning @xmath136 , for different values of the bath temperature @xmath137 .",
    "the resonant situation @xmath126 represents a minimum for the dependence of the equilibrium state on the initial state .",
    "the residual amount of information trapping has to be compared with the radius of equilibration @xmath61 , as discussed in section ( [ sec : mit ] ) . if @xmath138 , the residual dependence of the equilibrium state on the initial state of the open system is not enough to recognize that @xmath21 and @xmath60 evolve to different equilibrium states . on the ground of numerical simulations",
    ", we can consider the right hand side of ( [ eq : ww ] ) as an upper bound to @xmath61 , see also @xcite .",
    "thus , in figure ( [ fig:1 ] ) one can see that the information trapping is actually larger than @xmath61 for high enough detuning .",
    "from the point of view of the hamiltonian eigenvectors the condition @xmath126 is in fact very peculiar : the eigenvectors of the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian , the so - called dressed states , reduce for @xmath126 to @xmath139 plus the vacuum state @xmath140 .",
    "every eigenvector @xmath141 is maximally entangled in @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the two - dimensional subspace of @xmath5 spanned by @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "note that , at resonance , both the entanglement on the energy eigenbasis and the amount of residual information trapping , see ( [ eq : tlim ] ) , do not depend on the coupling constant @xmath105 between the system and the bath .",
    "thus , for the model at hand , a high entanglement in the energy eigenbasis ensures an ( effective ) independence of the equilibrium state on the initial state of the open system , as one can expect from @xcite .",
    "now , we want to explicitly quantify the role of the system - environment correlations , as well as the changes in the environmental state , by means of the upper bound introduced in ( [ eq : bb ] ) , i.e. @xmath146 .",
    "this quantity can be explicitly evaluated by following the same strategy employed in @xcite to calculate the amount of correlations in the total gibbs state , which takes advantage of the block diagonal structure of the total hamiltonian ( [ eq : hjc ] ) with respect to the dressed states . in figure ( [ fig:2 ] )",
    "one can see the measure @xmath68 as a function of the detuning @xmath136 compared with the upper bound .",
    "we observe how the latter , despite being quite far from the actual value of the measure for information trapping , follows its behavior from a qualitative point of view . indeed ,",
    "as follows from the bound ( [ eq : bb ] ) , small system - environment correlations and changes in the state of the bath imply a small amount of information trapping , and therefore an equilibrium state of the two - level system that hardly depends on its initial state .",
    "but for the model at hand , whenever strict contractivity holds , we have in addition that the more the interaction induces system - environment correlations and changes in the environmental state , the more the equilibrium state will depend on the initial reduced state @xmath21 .          as a complementary example",
    ", we consider now the model of a system interacting with a structured reservoir introduced in @xcite .",
    "a two - level system is coupled to two energy bands with the same width @xmath147 ; the energy levels in each band are equidistant and there are @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) levels in the lower ( upper ) band .",
    "the distance @xmath150 between the central levels of the two bands is in resonance with the free energy of the two - level system .",
    "the coupling constants between the two - level system and the two bands are independent and identically distributed complex gaussian random variables and their overall strength is parametrized by a constant @xmath151 .",
    "finally , we assume that the initial state of the environment is given by a maximally mixed combination of the lower band levels .",
    "thus , by means of hilbert space averaging @xcite or correlated projection superoperators @xcite techniques , one gets the following equations in the schrdinger picture for the excited state population @xmath152 and the coherence @xmath153 : @xmath154 where @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 .",
    "these equations are solved by @xmath158 the time averaging map corresponding to the evolution in ( [ eq : hh ] ) is , see ( [ eq : tam ] ) , @xmath159 indeed , for @xmath160 this map reduces to the identity map , while in all the other situations it is a strictly contractive non - idempotent map . the square of the time averaging map is given by @xmath161 so that the measure for information trapping defined in ( [ eq : t1 ] ) is @xmath162 and the maximization is obtained with @xmath134 .",
    "the information trapping is completely determined by the ratio @xmath163 and , in particular , it vanishes only in the limit @xmath164 , which corresponds to the trivial situation @xmath165 , or in the limit @xmath166 .",
    "finally , let us present a remark about the connection between information trapping and the non - markovianity of a quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "note that the relation between the asymptotic state of a reduced dynamics and its non - markovianity has been studied in @xcite . from ( [ eq : hh ] ) one",
    "can easily obtain a time - local master equation in the form @xmath167 to characterize the dynamics of the two - level system .",
    "the time - local generator @xmath168 is in fact simply given by @xcite @xmath169 so that , for the model at hand it reads @xmath170 \\\\",
    "\\fl&&+\\gamma_1(t)\\left[\\sigma_- \\rho(t ) \\sigma_+ - \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\{\\sigma_+ \\sigma_- , \\rho(t)\\right\\}\\right]+\\gamma_2(t)\\left[\\sigma_z \\rho(t ) \\sigma_z - \\rho(t ) \\right],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath171 such coefficients are positive at every time , implying that the reduced dynamics under consideration is always markovian , both in the sense that it implies a monotonic decrease of the trace distance in the course of time and in the sense that it is fixed by a divisible family of dynamical maps @xcite .",
    "this clearly shows that one can actually have information trapping also in the presence of a markovian dynamics : more generally , the dependence of the equilibrium state of the open system on its initial state does not provide a signature of non - markovianity according to the above mentioned definitions .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the thermalization of finite dimensional quantum systems , within the framework of the theory of open quantum systems . by only assuming an initial product state , we have shown how one can introduce a time averaging map on the state space of the open system that associates to any initial state the corresponding equilibrium state . in this way",
    ", we could formulate relevant questions related to equilibrium properties of the open system in terms of suitable properties of the time averaging map .",
    "in particular , the dependence of the equilibrium state on the initial reduced state can be always traced back to the violation of at least one of the properties of strict contractivity and idempotence of the time averaging map .",
    "indeed the violation of idempotence has been shown to provide an indication on the amount of information about the initial system state stored in the equilibrium state .",
    "we have therefore dubbed this violation as information trapping .",
    "it has been shown to be strictly connected to the interaction induced correlations between the system and the bath , as well as the changes in the environmental state , which keep track of system - environment information flow .",
    "more precisely , small system - environment interactions , together with small changes in the state of the bath , lead to an equilibrium state with a small dependence on the initial state of the open system , as quantified by means of the trace distance .",
    "furthermore , we have introduced a measure in order to evaluate the amount of information trapping of a given dynamics .",
    "this provides a way to determine how the different features of the dynamics influence the dependence of the equilibrium state on the initial state of the open system and therefore how they can favor or prevent a full thermalization .",
    "in particular , in the jaynes - cummings model one can conclude that if the time averaging map is strictly contractive , then strong system - environment correlations and changes in the environmental state imply a significant dependence of the equilibrium state on the initial state of the open system .",
    "indeed , it would be important to determine whether , or at least to what extent , this implication holds in general .    finally , let us note that the present results could provide a further insight into the role of the weak coupling assumption into the process of thermalization .",
    "if the open system and the bath are weakly coupled , one expects that the total state at a generic time can be effectively described by neglecting the system - environment correlations and the changes in the environmental state . in this regard",
    ", it will be of interest to investigate the connection between the correlation properties of the total time averaged stated studied in this work and the correlation properties of the total state in the course of time .",

    "first , let us introduce the notation @xmath177 so that @xmath178 and therefore , compare with eqs.([eq : ta2 ] ) and ( [ eq : rhok ] ) , @xmath179 from the bound @xmath180 , where @xmath181 denotes the hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath182 , and by exploiting the concavity of the square root we have @xmath183 from eqs.([eq : app21 ] ) and ( [ eq : app22 ] ) , it follows that @xmath184 using the identity @xmath185 and the fact that @xmath90 has non degenerate energy gaps one finds @xmath186 further exploiting the schwarz inequality @xmath187 we finally come to @xmath188 which , together with ( [ eq : app23 ] ) and ( [ eq : deff ] ) , gives ( [ eq : ww ] ) .",
    "the measure for information trapping in equation ( [ eq : t1 ] ) directly quantifies the effect of removing correlations and resetting the environmental state to its initial condition in the time averaged state @xmath77 , see also ( [ eq : dia ] ) and ( [ eq : bb ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is in some sense arbitrary to consider only the two - fold application of the time averaging map instead of a high number of applications .",
    "it is in fact clear that the dynamics obtained by resetting the total state to @xmath189 can still present some information trapped into the new equilibrium state as a consequence of further system - environment correlations built up by the interaction , and so on .",
    "for this reason , we introduce the following alternative measure for information trapping : @xmath190 which is set equal to @xmath191 if the limit does not exist for some @xmath21 .",
    "it is important to note that the two measures , @xmath68 and @xmath192 , give the same qualitative characterization of information trapping , i.e. also @xmath192 is equal to @xmath67 if and only if @xmath35 is idempotent .",
    "the `` if '' part is obvious . to check the `` only if '' part , @xmath193 implies by definition the existence of the limit in ( [ eq : t2 ] ) , and therefore in particular @xmath194 moreover , we can define the map @xmath195 through @xmath196 , and @xmath197 further implies that @xmath195 is equal to @xmath35 .",
    "this requires @xmath198 , but then , since in general @xmath199 , it follows that @xmath200 .",
    "finally , ( [ eq : lim ] ) is equivalent to @xmath201 implying @xmath202 , i.e. @xmath44 , which completes our proof .",
    "furthermore , note that if @xmath35 is strictly contractive , due to the banach fixed point theorem it has a unique invariant state @xmath203 , which is then a natural reference state to quantify the dependence of the equilibrium state on the initial condition : in this case , the measure ( [ eq : t2 ] ) can be simply written as @xmath204 for example , in the jaynes - cummings model , for @xmath205 , the time averaging map @xmath35 ( [ eq : tajc ] ) is strictly contractive . since @xmath206 the limit map @xmath195 is given by @xmath207 which then provides the unique invariant state of the strictly contractive map @xmath35 . the measure ( [ eq : t2 ] )",
    "is thus given by @xmath208 to be compared with ( [ eq : ex1 ] ) .",
    "analogously , in the model considered in section [ sec : struct ] , for @xmath209 , the map @xmath195 associates every state @xmath21 with the unique fixed point , the vacuum state @xmath210 , of the strictly contractive map @xmath35 in equation ( [ eq : tag ] ) , i.e. @xmath211 and the measure for information trapping reads @xmath212 to be compared with ( [ eq : gemmer3 ] ) . in both cases the use of this alternative measure does not qualitatively change the results , which justifies to concentrate on idempotence .",
