    "the blackbody temperature and the emitting area are comparable with these systems . *",
    "if v2491 cyg is a `` soft ip '' , the soft x - ray flux emitting region underwent a seamless , early transition from nuclear burning to accretion spot emission , taking into account the observations of @xcite .",
    "* there are two optically thin plasma components with characteristic temperatures @xmath00.2 kev and @xmath01020 kev , which may be due to a temperature gradient in the post - shock region . * we need a complex , partially covering absorber with n(h)@xmath110 @xmath6 to fit the data , like in many ips .",
    "this phenomenon is usually caused by the accretion curtains crossing the line of sight @xcite .",
    "* the equivalent width of the fe k@xmath18 line in v2491 cyg is very large , 246 ev , like usually in ips ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the fe lines in ips ) .",
    "this is evidence of reflection of the x - ray emitting plasma , most probably from the surface of the wd @xcite .",
    "it may also indicate copious x - ray emission above the _ suzaku _ xis detectors range .",
    "however , the observed compton thin absorber can also contribute to the 6.4 kev line ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most widely accepted proof of an ip , in which the wd is not synchoronized with the orbital period , is the detection of the spin period in x - rays .",
    "the x - ray flux is modulated because the accretion channeled to the pole is shocked , so it is self - occulted and partially absorbed as the wd rotates .",
    "we detected an x - ray flux modulation with a period of @xmath111 min that can be attributed to the wd spin .",
    "energy dependence of the amplitude of the pulses supports this assumption and is consistent with the accretion curtain scenario @xcite .",
    "* however , this period is probably not entirely stable . on the other hand , detection of the spin period may not always be possible .",
    "@xcite suggested that if the magnetic and rotational axes of a wd are closely aligned , the spin rotation may be undetectable .",
    "we presented the _ suzaku _ xis observation of the cn v2491 cyg obtained in quiescence , more than two years after the outburst .",
    "the very high x - ray flux that we measured is close to the pre - outburst level @xcite and to the values that were obtained about 250 days after the outburst @xcite .",
    "it indicates a high x - ray luminosity , and hence high accretion rate .",
    "we found that the spectral characteristics of the nova are very typical of `` soft ip '' , such as the presence of a blackbody - like component with t@xmath112 ev , optically - thin thermal plasma emission with two characteristic temperatures and a partially - covering absorber .",
    "the hard band x - ray luminosity also indicates magnetic driven accretion .",
    "we detected the energy dependent x - ray flux modulation with period @xmath0 38 min that may be attributed to the wd rotation .",
    "however , there are uncertainties in the stability of the 38 min period , and in the origin of the blackbody - like component which may be due to residual and localized nuclear burning",
    ".    magnetic wds in novae have been observed in three systems : in two ips ( gk per and dq her ) and in one polar ( v1500 cyg ) .",
    "there are also several other ip candidates : v1425 cyg , v533 her and v842 cen , v4743 sgr @xcite .",
    "little is known how the magnetic field changes the nova evolution , it may really steer the path towards , or away from , a type ia sn explosion in rne .    if v2491 cyg is not an ip , more questions remain unresolved .",
    "the first concerns the possible confinement of nuclear burning .",
    "a second question arises if accretion is channeled through the boundary layer of a disk ; in this case the observed x - ray light curve modulation is most probably a quasi periodic oscillations , originating in the inner part of the accretion disk .",
    "however , this does not explain the energy dependence of the amplitude of the pulses .",
    "an important measurement in further observations would be that of the orbital period .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "observations , presented in this paper , lasted for slightly shorter than two days and we did not find the orbital modulation , usually observed in x - rays in ips @xcite .    to conclude , v2491 cyg seems to be a puzzling key object to understand the secular evolution of novae .",
    "we suggest that it should still be observed in different wavelengths . a hard x - ray observation with _ nustar",
    "_ would explain the origin of the strong 6.4 kev line .",
    "new soft x - ray observations would clarify the stability and nature of the @xmath038.3 min modulation of the x - ray flux .",
    "finally , with optical observations we may measure the orbital period ."
