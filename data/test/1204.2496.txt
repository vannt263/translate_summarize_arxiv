    "fueled by the successes of current transit - observation incentives like kepler @xcite and corot @xcite the quest for discovering the first earth - twin has lead to a considerable cross - disciplinary interest in the interplay between stellar and planetary properties to produce habitable worlds .",
    "even - though opinions differ on what exactly to look for in a system harboring a terrestrial planet in order to declare it habitable ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the classical assumption investigated by @xcite , i.e. the capacity for water to stay liquid on the planet s surface , may still be considered a prerequisite for the development and sustainability of complex life as we know it @xcite .",
    "this entails restrictions on planetological characteristics , such as mass , atmospheric and bulk composition , and sets limits to the host star s activity as well as radiation properties @xcite .",
    "dynamical considerations are of equal importance , since changes in orbital stability , or extreme variations in insolation due to large planetary eccentricities ( @xmath0 ) may also result in a hostile environment @xcite .",
    "it is therefore only natural that one would look for a copy of our solar system , when searching for habitable worlds .",
    "yet , the study of exoplanetary systems so far has clearly shown that a broader perspective is required .",
    "in fact , up to 70% of all stellar systems in our galaxy may not be single but multi - stellar systems ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "together with the approximately 60 planets that have already been discovered in systems harboring two stars @xcite this suggests that binary and multiple star systems should not be ignored in the search for habitable worlds .",
    "investigations of environments that permit planetary formation in binary star systems have progressed rapidly over the last decade ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . even -",
    "though important questions regarding the early phases of planet formation in binary star systems - especially the transition from planetesimal to planetary embryos - still remain to be answered , late stage formation scenarios for terrestrial planets in such environments are available @xcite . since previous studies did consider the extent of the classical habitable zone ( khz ) to be purely a function of the primary star s luminosity and spectral type as introduced by @xcite ( hereafter kwr93 ) , we aim to refine this definition to encompass the gravitational and radiative influence of a second star .",
    "this article is structured as follows : after a short recapitulation of the main radiative aspects of habitability as defined in kwr93 section [ sec : bp ] introduces three exemplary binary - planet configurations , which will serve as test - cases for habitability considerations .",
    "section [ sec : stab ] briefly mentions the dynamical requirements which binary - planet configurations have to fulfill in order to ensure system stability . in section [ sec : sec ] the maximum radiative influence of the second star on a terrestrial planet in the primary s hz is estimated and compared to actual insolation simulations .",
    "the occurring differences are being investigated in the following section . finally , generalized , analytical estimates are developed and compared to numerical simulations in sections [ sec : ana ] & [ sec : num ] , and the results concerning the behavior of hzs in binary star systems are presented in section [ sec : res ] .",
    "a discussion of the results concludes this article .",
    "ccc f0 & 1.90 & 0.46 + g2 & 1.41 & 0.36 + m0 & 1.05 & 0.27    apart from planetological and dynamical aspects , the insolation a terrestrial planet receives from its host star is naturally the main driver determining the extent of the hz . when considering planets within a binary star system it is therefore important to track the combined radiation of both stars arriving at the planet .",
    "kwr93 showed that not only the sheer amount of insolation , but also the spectral distribution is essential to estimate limiting values for atmospheric collapse . in order to model the impact of diverse stellar spectral classes on an earth - like planet s atmosphere ,",
    "kwr93 introduced so - called effective radiation values .",
    "these measure the relative impact a comparable amount of radiation ( e.g. 1360 @xmath1 $ ] ) with different spectral properties has on a planet s atmosphere . taking the effects of different stellar spectra into account is especially important in binary star systems with different stellar components",
    "[ tab2 ] reproduces the effective radiation values for the inner ( runaway greenhouse ) and outer ( maximum greenhouse ) edge of a single star s hz as given in kwr93 .",
    "notice how the onset of runaway greenhouse effects requires almost twice as much radiation for a spectral distribution akin to f0 class stars compared to m0 spectral types .",
    "even though @xcite assume similar effective radiation values for m and k spectral classes , actual calculations have only been done for f0 , g2 and m0 zams stars .",
    "for this reason , we first investigate the following three stellar configurations :"
