    "fourier s law describes the transport of heat in a macroscopic object .",
    "the calculation of the thermal conductivity that appears in the fourier s law is fundamental and important in understanding the properties of materials .",
    "such a calculation must be grounded upon quantum mechanics with phonons as basic quasi - particles .",
    "this is a non - trivial task and was successfully carried out many years ago by peierls @xcite using the boltzmann equation for phonons .",
    "molecular dynamic ( md ) simulation is another approach .",
    "however , md results are not correct at low temperatures as it is purely a classical approach .",
    "the early works are mostly concerned with bulk materials with many degrees of freedom and periodic lattices @xcite . in recent years",

    "the discreteness of the atom is important .",
    "the concept of phonons developed for the periodic lattices is somewhat difficult to apply if a system does not possess translational invariance , such as a nano - junction .",
    "in such situation , the boltzmann - peierls approach is not applicable .",
    "there are several alternative methods that have overcome the above problems .",
    "first , the landauer formula @xcite is a simple and clear description of the heat transport in purely ballistic regime at low temperatures .",
    "there are also a few other approaches @xcite with different approximations such as the description based on density matrices .",
    "one of the features of the existing theories is that they work in either the ballistic regime or diffusive regime , but not both .",
    "it is rather difficult to have a complete theory that can encompass both regimes , apart from phenomenological treatments @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium green s function formalism described in this article is a serious attempt to be such a complete theory .",
    "this theory is certainly `` first principles '' given the atomic potentials .",
    "several similar formulations have already been done at the elastic level without nonlinear interactions @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we presented a new formulation with the nonlinear interaction treated systematically .",
    "mingo also gave a similar result @xcite for the nonlinear interactions .",
    "our approach is essentially a generalization of the nonequilibrium green s function method in electronic transport @xcite , with fermions replaced by bosons as basic entities .",
    "although the techniques have been extensively described in the literature , most of them are centered around fermions . in this paper",
    ", we give a description of the method , emphasizing on both the theoretical formulation and computational implementation .",
    "we begin with an elementary introduction of the green s functions , including the contour - ordered green s functions .",
    "we then discuss equations of motion of the green s functions , feynman diagrammatic expansion , and dyson equations .",
    "we discuss the heat current and derive a formula for effective transmission when there are nonlinear interactions .",

    "<S> we present a detailed treatment of the nonequilibrium green s function method for thermal transport due to atomic vibrations in nanostructures . some of the key equations , such as self - energy and conductance with nonlinear effect , are derived . </S>",
    "<S> a self - consistent mean - field theory is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> computational procedures are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applied to a number of systems including one - dimensional chains , a benzene ring junction , and carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> mean - field calculations of the fermi - pasta - ulam model are compared with classical molecular dynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that nonlinearity suppresses thermal transport even at moderately high temperatures . </S>"
