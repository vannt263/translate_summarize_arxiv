    "the determination of the mass content of galaxies is a fundamental step for our understanding of their formation and evolution .",
    "this is particularly true for small systems such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) , whose total mass can determine their destiny as being fragile objects , strongly perturbed by supernovae explosions and/or interactions with the environment , or mostly undisturbed objects .",
    "part of the interest in determining the masses of dsphs has surely been driven by the fact that these galaxies , with mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios up to 100s , appear to be the most dark matter ( dm ) dominated objects known to - date .",
    "this makes them potentially good testing grounds for different dm theories of galaxy formation ; however at the moment it is still unclear if dsphs inhabit cusped dm profiles , as predicted by cold dm theories of galaxy formation , or cored profiles , typical of warmer kinds of dm .",
    "this distinction is often hampered by the degeneracies which are intrinsic to the method generally used to determine the mass of pressure - supported stellar systems , i.e. a jeans analysis of the line - of - sight ( l.o.s . )",
    "velocity dispersion obtained considering all stars as a single component embedded in an extended dm halo .",
    "this analysis is subject to the well known degeneracy between the mass distribution and the orbital motions of the individual stars in the system ( mass - anisotropy degeneracy ) .",
    "recent observations have shown that some dsphs host multiple stellar populations which have distinct spatial distribution , metallicity and kinematics .",
    "the presence of multiple stellar populations requires a modification in the way these systems are dynamically modelled to derive their mass content .",
    "here we describe the results of our determination of the mass content of the sculptor ( scl ) dsph by adopting a more detailed kinematic modelling than the traditional one , i.e. by considering scl as two-(stellar ) components embedded in an extended dm halo .",
    "we first briefly describe and discuss the observational properties of scl derived from our work ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tolstoy et al . 2004 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* battaglia 2007 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* battaglia et al . 2008 ) ) .",
    "we then move to the results of the two - component modelling ; we show a clear example of the mass - anisotropy present when modelling scl as a one - stellar component system , and finally discuss our results . for a more detailed description",
    "we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* battaglia ( 2007 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* battaglia et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ) .",
    "we acquired extended photometry from the eso/2.2 m wfi and vlt / flames spectra ( r@xmath06500 ) in the caii triplet region for hundreds of individual red giant branch ( rgb ) stars in scl , out to its nominal tidal radius ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tolstoy et al . 2004 ) : 308 probable members ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* battaglia et al . 2008 ) : 470 probable members ) .",
    "we used these data to study the large scale kinematics and metallicity properties of scl , and the spatial distribution of its stellar populations .    the combined information from the accurate line - of - sight velocities ( @xmath12 km  s@xmath2 ) and metallicities ( @xmath10.15 dex ) of rgb stars allowed us to unveil the presence of two distinct stellar populations with different spatial distribution , metallicity and kinematics : the metal rich ( mr ) stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath3 ) are more centrally concentrated and show colder kinematics than the metal poor ( mp ) stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath4 ) , as can be seen from the line - of - sight ( l.o.s . ) velocity dispersion profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrmp ] .",
    "the mr and mp rgb stars appear to trace , respectively , the red and blue horizontal branch ( rhb , bhb ) stars .",
    "the surface number density profile of rgb stars , representative of the overall stellar population of scl , is well approximated by a two - component fit , where each component is given by the rescaled best - fitting profile derived from our photometry for the rhb and bhb stars .",
    "in contrast , a single profile ( be it a plummer , sersic or king ) does not appear to be a good approximation for the surface number density of rgb stars .",
    "multiple stellar populations are known to exist also in other dsphs , such as fornax ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* battaglia et al . 2006 ) ) and canes venatici ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ibata et al .",
    "2006 ) ) , and might be a common feature to this class of objects .    the large spatial coverage and statistics of this spectroscopic data - set has allowed the discovery of another interesting feature , i.e. a velocity gradient of 7.6 km  s@xmath2deg@xmath2 in the galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) along the projected major axis of scl .",
    "this gradient is likely to due intrinsic rotation , and not to tidal disruption ( see ( * ? ? ? *",
    "battaglia 2007 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* battaglia et al . 2008 ) for discussion on this point ) , and this is the first time that statistically significant rotation is found in a dsph .    among the other milky way ( mw ) dsphs , a significant velocity gradient is detected in carina ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* muoz et al . 2006 ) ) and a mild one in leo  i ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mateo et al . 2008 ) ) , but these are interpreted as the result of tidal interaction with the mw",
    ". however , velocity gradients are not exclusive of the dsphs satellites of larger galaxies , but are present also in some of the isolated local group dsphs , such as cetus ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lewis et al . 2007 ) ) and tucana ( fraternali et al . , in preparation ) , which are unlikely to have ever interacted with either the mw or m31 and therefore suffered tidal disturbance .",
    "this might point to rotation as an intrinsic property of this class of objects and provide insights into the mechanisms that shaped their evolution .",
    "this might for instance favour scenarios in which the progenitors of dsphs were rotating systems which were transformed into prevalently pressure supported object by tidal stirring from their host galaxy ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mayer et al . 2001 ) ) .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to compare the frequency of occurrence of rotation among dsphs and other generally more isolated systems such as dwarf irregular galaxies and transition types .",
    "it is possible that more velocity gradients will be discovered in mw dsphs now that larger and more spatially extended velocity surveys are becoming available .    in the analysis presented here we always use rotation - subtracted gsr velocities .",
    "dsphs generally have low ellipticities and are presumably prevalently pressure supported , and therefore are commonly considered as spherical and with no streaming motions .",
    "then , if the system is in dynamical equilibrium , the l.o.s .",
    "velocity dispersion predicted by the jeans equation is ( from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* binney & mamon 1982 ) )    @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the projected radius ( on the sky ) and @xmath7 is the 3d radius .",
    "the l.o.s .",
    "velocity dispersion depends on : the mass surface density @xmath8 and mass density @xmath9 of the tracer , which in our case are the mr and the mp rgb stars ; the tracer velocity anisotropy @xmath10 , defined as @xmath11 , and its radial velocity dispersion @xmath12 , which depends on the total mass distribution ( for dsphs the contribution due to stellar mass is negligible ) .",
    "a unique solution for the mass profile can be determined from this equation if both the mass distribution of the tracer and @xmath13 are known , although this solution is not guaranteed to produce a phase - space distribution function that is positive everywhere . however",
    ", proper motions for individual stars in the system would be necessary to derive @xmath13 and this is not feasible yet .",
    "this causes the well - known mass - anisotropy degeneracy , which prevents a distinction amongst different dm profiles .",
    "examples of this are present in the literature : the observed l.o.s .",
    "dispersion profiles of dsphs are both compatible with cored dm models , assuming that @xmath14 ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gilmore et al . 2007 ) ) , and with cusped profiles , allowing for mildly tangential , constant with radius , @xmath10 ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* walker et al .",
    "it is therefore advisable to explore several hypotheses for the behaviour of @xmath13 and for the mass distribution when carrying out a jeans analysis ( see below ) .    in the following we explore the possibility that dm follows a cored ( pseudo - isothermal sphere ) or a cuspy distribution ( nfw profile )",

    ", each mass model has two free parameters left : the anisotropy and the dm halo mass ( enclosed within the last measured point for the isothermal sphere , at 1.3 deg @xmath21 1.8 kpc assuming a distance to scl of 79 kpc , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mateo 1998 ) ; and the virial mass in the case of the nfw model ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : mrmp]a , b shows the models with constant anisotropy , which can be excluded as in this case neither a cored or a cusped model is a good representation of the data ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the situation is different in the hypothesis of an om velocity anisotropy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrmp]c , d ) .",
    "we find that a pseudo - isothermal sphere with a relatively large core ( @xmath270.5 kpc , @xmath28 m@xmath29 ) gives an excellent description of the data ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "also an nfw model is statistically consistent with the data ( @xmath31 , virial mass @xmath32 m@xmath29 , @xmath33 ) , but tends to over - predict the central values of the mr velocity dispersion .",
    "the mass within the last measured point ( @xmath34 m@xmath29 ) is consistent with the mass predicted by the best - fitting isothermal sphere model .",
    "figure  [ fig : all ] shows a clear example of the mass - anisotropy degeneracy when modelling scl with the traditional one - component analysis . just by changing the assumption on @xmath10 ( @xmath21const . or @xmath35 ) , cored profiles with very different core radii and @xmath36 give excellent fit to the data .",
    "an excellent fit is also an nfw profile , in the hypothesis of @xmath37 const .",

    "the combined information of velocity and metallicity from a large sample of flames spectra of individual stars in scl has allowed us to separate the different kinematics of the two stellar populations in scl , and to carry out a more detailed kinematic modelling which allows us to partially break the mass - anisotropy degeneracy .    under the hypotheses explored for the behaviour of the velocity anisotropy @xmath13 , the two - component modelling indicates that a cored profile is slightly favoured over a cusped profile , as the latter tends to over - predict the central values ( at @xmath42 0.1 kpc ) of the mr velocity dispersion .",
    "it could be argued that the relatively large central dispersion predicted for the mr stars from the cusped profile could be lowered by allowing the velocity anisotropy of the mr population to be tangential at @xmath42 0.1 kpc .",
    "however it should be noted that in order to reproduce the rapid decline of the mr velocity dispersion profile , the mr @xmath13 needs to become very radial already on the scale of 0.3 - 0.4 kpc , given the observed spatial distribution of mr stars .",
