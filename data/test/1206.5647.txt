    "[ magnetization philipp ] shows the corresponding data of the detector with ion - implanted absorber . for these data sets no deviation from the expected behavior",
    "can be seen at high temperature , due to an improved shielding . at low temperatures a small thermal decoupling of the detector chip from the thermal bath",
    "is again observed . comparing the results obtained with the two detectors we conclude that the implantation process , as expected , does not compromise the magnetic properties of the sensor .",
    "in fact the implanted ions are at a relatively large distance from to the meander - shaped pick - up coil , about @xmath65 m , and therefore the magnetic moments of those ions have a negligible coupling to the coil .",
    "[ t ]     [ t ]       the implantation of heavy ions in a gold film produces lattice defects which could change the thermal properties of the absorber , in particular they could be responsible for an additional contribution in the heat capacity .",
    "moreover , the ions with large electronic magnetic moments and/or nuclear moments present in the implanted beam could add another contribution to the heat capacity due to interacting localized electronic magnetic moments and hyperfine split nuclear levels .",
    "to test these effects , we compared the response upon the deposition of energy in the absorber of the detector with non - implanted absorber to the response of the detector with implanted absorber .",

    "the thermal response of the detector with implanted absorber does not show to be noticeably degraded by defects created during the implantation or by additional contributions to the heat capacity due to magnetic impurities .",

    "on the other hand , we can argue that the largest part of the contaminants also carries magnetic moments .",
    "therefore we can set a very important limit for the future detector design : the lattice defects and the presence of magnetic moments due to the implantation of about @xmath50 atoms in the detector absorber do not noticeably compromise the performance of the detector .",

    "this result follows also from the fact that the measured pulse height was not affected by any noticeable additional contribution to the specific heat .    in future detector developments",
    ", a new absorber concept will be studied .",
    "the goal will be to reduce the heat capacity , in order to improve the intrinsic energy resolution of the detector , while keeping the quantum efficiency to be approximately 100@xmath5 . in order to achieve this",
    ", we will investigate new materials with reduced specific heat , like superconductors , to be used as absorber .",
    "a second important improvement will be to connect the absorber to the sensor through stems in order to eliminate the loss of energy by initial hot phonons .",
    "for the precise characterization of energy spectra , the energy calibration and a confident understanding of the non - linearity of the detector are extremely important .",
    "[ ho_spe ] shows the calorimetric measurement of the ec spectrum of @xmath0ho .",
    "the lines corresponding to the ec spectrum of @xmath0ho are marked by superimposing to the histogram the corresponding fit function represented by a shaded area the other lines , which have not superimposed fit function , represent the ec spectrum of @xmath54pm .",
    "more details for the description and analysis of the ec calorimetric spectrum of @xmath0ho can be found in @xcite . here , we want to discuss the detector linearity in the energy range up to about @xmath92kev .",
    "the lines used to test the linearity are the neodymium mi , mii , mii , li , lii , liii lines and the manganese k@xmath93-line . in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ linearity ] the measured signal amplitudes are plotted versus the energies reported in @xcite .",
    "the symbols represent the experimental data .",
    "the continuous black line represents a linear fit to the experimental points while the dashed line represents a quadratic fit .",
    "the lower part of fig . [ linearity ] shows the non - linearity of the detector , as the difference between measured values and values extracted by the linear part of the quadratic fit . as can be seen a non - linearity of less than 1@xmath5",
    "is present at 8 kev .",
    "this value is in agreement with previous measurements @xcite . with this energy calibration",
    "it is possible to investigate the position of the calorimetric lines with the precision given by the energy resolution and the acquired statistics .",
    "ho indicated by the superimposed fit ( dashed region ) .",
    "the other lines which are present in the spectrum correspond to the calorimetric ec spectrum of @xmath54pm . ]",
    "as described in section 2 all four absorbers were exposed to the ion beam . therefore in all the four absorbers",
    "radioactive decays are occurring . since the energy absorbed in a given pixel",
    "is then transferred to the common silicon substrate , part of this heat can as well flow back to the other three detectors giving rise to background pulses .",
    "these spurious thermal signals will appear in the energy spectrum of the read out detector , after being calibrated using the direct events , at a position given by the relative amplitude .",
    "these events can be well discriminated by the different pulse shape and be can rejected . the largest contribution to the spurious events in case of the measured detector",
    "is due to the presence of the 40 kev atomic de - excitation following the capture of a k electron in @xmath54pm . in fig . [ 4pixels ] c ) the letter a indicates the detector that was measured in this experiment . within the thermal pulses that were acquired , we could observe the direct events in the absorber of detector a , the spurious events due to heat flowing through the substrate after a k capture in the neighboring pixels and spurious events corresponding to interaction of those photons in the substrate due to the non - complete quantum efficiency of the absorber for the 40 kev radiation .    [ t ]     according to the position of the detectors on the chip , we expected to see , in a plot discriminating the pulse shape , four different families of pulses . these four families represent the direct events in detector a",
    ", events in detector c ( as indicated in fig .",
    "[ 4pixels ] c ) ) positioned on the same diagonal as detector a , events in the two pixels , b and d , positioned on the other diagonal , which have symmetric positions with respect to the detector a and can not be discriminated , and events in the substrate .",
    "considering that , in first approximation , in each absorber the same number of ions has been implanted and using the quantum efficiency related to the absorber geometry and substrate volume , we quantified the number of expected events for the detection of the 40 kev photons in the different families .",
    "in particular , the number of events in the read out detector a should be the same , within the statistical errors , as the ones in the detector c on the same diagonal while the family of events generated in the two pixels b and d on the other diagonal should have twice the amount of events .",
    "the number of events expected in the substrate , calculated according to the stopping power in the different materials , is about the same as the one expected for the sum of the events in the pixels b and d.    in fig .",
    "[ background ] the area of the pulses , calculated as integral of the signal over the acquisition time - window , is plotted versus the fitted amplitude with respect to a reference pulse .",
    "the four families of pulses can be well discriminated . for the direct events in detector a the group of points for the ki line of nd",
    "is not contained in this amplitude scale ( the group of events at amplitude 1.25 correspond to about 400 ev ) , while for the other three families the groups of points corresponding to ki are marked . as expected ,",
    "since only part of the energy transferred to the substrate flows back to the read out detector , the amplitude of the spurious thermal pulses is much smaller than the thermal pulses generated by the same decay through direct events in the read out detector . analyzing the number of counts corresponding to what we interpret as the nd ki line",
    ", the expected ratios are obtained .",
    "the number of events in the read out detector a is 370 , in the detector c in the same diagonal 365 .",
    "for the two pixels b and d the number of events is 740 and for the substrate 720 .",
    "this analysis shows that our model to discuss the different families of events in relation to their pulse shape agrees with the measured data .",
    "moreover , the possibility to isolate families of events according to the location of the corresponding decay offers a useful method to reject the non - direct signals .",
    "however , this method becomes less efficient in the low energy range , below 100 ev ( calibrated using the direct events in the read out detector ) , where the signal to noise ratio is smaller .",
    "the difficulty in rejecting the events occurring in the non - read out detector and in the substrate has the effect to increase the background which complicates the analysis of the @xmath0ho ec spectrum .        in future detectors for a high precision calorimetric measurement of the ec spectrum of @xmath0ho , the presence of contaminants as @xmath54pm will be eliminated and , with that , also the major contribution of background events .",
    "methods to obtain a very pure @xmath0ho source are already developed by our collaborators at the saha institute for nuclear physics in kolkata @xcite .",
    "still to consider are the cross - talk pulses caused by the @xmath0ho decays occurring in the neighboring pixels .",
    "as an example , the mi transition at @xmath94kev for events occurring in the neighboring pixels , is seen in the read out detector at a reduced signal amplitude corresponding to about 20 ev .",
    "this cross - talk can degrade the energy resolution of the detector since it could lead to non - resolvable pile - up .",
    "in addition natural radioactivity and cosmic rays can produce events in the substrate as well as in the detectors and therefore generate additional background . a possible way to avoid background events generated through the substrate , such as cross - talk events from decays in neighboring pixels and the interaction in the substrate of particle originated from natural radioactivity ,",
    "would be the use of the full gradiometric meander pick - up coil structure @xcite . the cross - talk between neighboring pixels",
    "can be reduced by two orders of magnitude by having both meander - shaped pick - up coils equipped with sensor and absorber . a further improvement to reduce even more",
    "the problem of cross - talk would be the application of a membrane as detector substrate .",
    "in this case meander - shaped pick - up coils with the implanted detector on top will be positioned on a sin membrane which is only about @xmath95 m thick .",
    "suitable thermal links , made out of thin normal metal films , will connect the detector to the thermal bath .",
    "all the pixels will then be thermally disconnected from each other and from the si substrate .",
    "in this work we have characterized a fully micro - fabricated mmc which was irradiated at isolde . we compared the performance of the detector with the implanted absorber with the performance of a detector with non - implanted absorber .",
    "we could demonstrate that the performance of the detector , after undergoing the ion - implantation process is not degraded .",
    "moreover , we showed the possibility to measure with high energy resolution the atomic de - excitation following an ec decay of implanted ions , @xmath0ho and @xmath54pm .",
    "in particular we described the case of the ni line of dysprosium .",
    "we discussed the importance of high resolution calorimetric measurements to investigate the line shape of the atomic de - excitation analyzing the case of the ni line of dysprosium .",
    "the performance achieved by the tested detector proves that mmcs with the absorber having ion - implanted @xmath0ho source , can provide high energy resolution calorimetric measurements of the ec spectrum of @xmath0ho .",
    "we pointed out possible improvements in the detector design which will lead to an improved energy sensitivity and to a reduction of background events .",
    "the optimization of future detector designs will be a fundamental aspect of the echo experiment @xcite aiming at the investigation of the electron neutrino mass in the sub - ev energy range .",
