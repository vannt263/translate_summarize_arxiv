    "capella ( @xmath2  aur ; g1iii / g8iii ) is the strongest non - solar coronal source accessible to high - sensitivity high - energy telescopes , and has been a common calibration target for x - ray and euv instruments such as _ euve _ , , xmm-_newton _ , etc .",

    "this variability can occur due to many causes , ranging from cyclical dynamo variations ( timescales of decades to years ) , to rotational modulation ( months to hours ) , to active region evolution ( hours to days ) , to flaring ( hours to minutes ) .",
    "generally , active stars are characterized by recurrent flares ( see e.g. , gdel 2004 ) that are recognized in x - ray and euv light curves as sudden increases in the luminosity followed by a slower decay . however , as activity increases , the flares start to occur closer in time to each other , and it becomes increasingly difficult to resolve them in the light curve ( cf .",

    "it is clear from the  light curve ( figure  [ f : ctrt ] ) that capella undergoes slow changes in its luminosity over timescales of weeks and months , with count rates ranging from @xmath23  .",
    "for instance , note the drop in intensity between obsids 6552 and 6555 , which are separated by 16  days , to @xmath24  mm between these two observations , and it could be argued that uncalibrated differences in the qe uniformity may account for the drop in intensity .",
    "however , the similarity of count rates between observations 6558 and 6559 , both of which were carried out on the same day , but at sim offsets of @xmath25 and @xmath26  mm respectively , indicates that the drop in intensity is real . ] and the difference between obsids 6559 and 8360 , which are done @xmath27  yr apart , but are both carried out at the same detector location ( thus precluding calibration differences as a factor ; see  [ s : hz43 ] below ) .",
    "this impression is confirmed by an autocorrelation analysis ; we construct count rate light curves @xmath28 at various binning sizes @xmath29 and compute the autocorrelation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the average count rate in the @xmath32 bins in the light curve . the autocorrelation for @xmath33",
    "s is shown in figure  [ f : autocorr ] as the dark blue curve ( curves for other bin sizes are similar ) , along with estimates of the 95% and 99% uncertainties for each lag time @xmath34 .",
    "these uncertainties are computed via monte carlo simulations , by constructing 1000 light curves with the same number of bins as in @xmath28 , as poisson deviates for an unvarying source intensity of @xmath35 .",
    "the autocorrelation drops linearly until it becomes indistinguishable from statistical noise at a lag time of @xmath36  ks ; this is the typical signature of variability which occurs at timescales @xmath1  ks , such that count rates that are separated by longer timescales are essentially uncorrelated . at larger lag times , @xmath37  ks",
    ", the autocorrelation appears to rise again , but this is not distinguishable from statistical noise .",
    "ks , the autocorrelation drops further and becomes significantly @xmath38 , suggesting that the count rates are anticorrelated at large timescales , i.e. , the intensity tends to fluctuate over long temporal separations .",
    "however , these values are not physically meaningful , since the data gaps between observations are large and the lag time ceases to be a useful construct .",
    "note that typical observation times are 5  ks , and the observation times for contiguous obsids ranges from 12 to 62  ks , with a median of 19  ks ( see figure  [ f : ctrt ] ) .",
    "] this is consistent with the results found by raasen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and westbrook et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who found similar variations over similar timescales .",
    "however , at a counts intensity level of @xmath39  ( obtained from acis - s / hetg dispersed counts ) they were unable to detect any variability at timescales @xmath40  ks corresponding to the durations of the observations , even using sophisticated algorithms such as the one described by gregory & loredo ( 1992 ) .",
    "here , we observe the source with a counts intensity an order of magnitude higher , and are thus able to investigate the variability at shorter timescales .",
    "note that argiroffi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) also find no variability at timescales @xmath41  ks , but again , the hrc - s / letgs data they rely on has count rates of @xmath42  , which is too small to detect the existence of variability on capella .    because the  observations are done in short segments , it is useful to consider the effect of removing large timescale effects on the autocorrelation .",
    "we thus reconstruct the light curve by offsetting that computed in each obsid by the average intensity of the source during that obsid ( i.e. , for each segment the average count rate is set to @xmath26 ) , and recompute the autocorrelation .",
    "this has the effect of completely removing variations at timescales greater than @xmath43 of the typical exposure time , and will reveal any variability that may exist at very small timescales .",
    "the result of this is shown as the pale blue curve in figure  [ f : autocorr ] .",
    "this is everywhere consistent with no variability .",
    "because the typical observation time is 5  ks , this suggests that there is no variability variability on capella at timescales @xmath42  ks . note that offsetting the light curves by different amounts at different times , as we have done in this exercise , introduces additional statistical uncertainty into the results because of a non - stationary bias , and therefore the power of the test to detect a variability signal",
    "is decreased . in order to determine",
    "whether there does exist variability over timescales of @xmath44  ks , we test the dispersion of the fluctuations ( see  [ s : overdisp ] ) .      the large count rates of capella seen with the  afford us the capability to analyze the light curve at short timescales .",
    "in order to test the constancy of the intensity within each obsid , we carry out a kolmogorov - smirnoff ( k - s ) test on the photon arrival time data in each obsid .",
    "a large fraction of the datasets show evidence that the null hypothesis of no variation within an observation can be rejected : 17% have @xmath45 , and 37% have @xmath46 .",
    "this is not strong evidence for short timescale variability , but the repeated rejection of the null at a frequency larger than expected indicates the possible existence of intermittent variability .",
    "also note that the k - s test generally has low power in detecting small , slow variations , and a better test is required .",
    "for that , we consider whether the observed fluctuations in the light curve are consistent with statistical deviations .",
    "such a test is also of value in establishing the magnitude of the residual calibration errors ( see  [ s : hz43 ] ) .",
    "( top ) , @xmath47 ( middle ) , and @xmath48 ( bottom ) are calculated for each obsid for different values of the light curve bin sizes @xmath49  s , and are denoted by the thin vertical lines grouped around the sim offset for that observation .",
    "the lines are offset from each other for clarity and have @xmath29 increasing from left to right , and the measured values for each obsid are connected by dark lines .",
    "the vertical lines represent the @xmath50 error bars for the _ null _ , determined from monte carlo simulations of a model without any intrinsic variability but matching the count rate and exposure time of the observation .",
    "the values expected for the null model are shown for each @xmath51 as the horizontal dashed line .",
    "the overdispersion measures computed for the combined 43data ( for a binning that matches @xmath52  s for capella ) is shown as the pale blue band whose width corresponds to the @xmath50 error bounds determined the same way as for capella .",
    "[ f : overdisp],width=528 ]    the  light curve ( figure  [ f : ctrt ] ) shows numerous sharp fluctuations similar to that expected from poisson fluctuations .",
    "we have tested whether these fluctuations are consistent with such a picture , and conclude that they are not ; the observed fluctions are invariably _ overdispersed _ compared to the expected poisson deviations ( see figure  [ f : overdisp ] ) .",
    "in particular , given a counts light curve @xmath53 for obsid @xmath54 , where @xmath55 are the @xmath32 time bins resulting from choosing a bin of size @xmath29 , we summarize the light curve with its mean @xmath56 and variance @xmath57 ^ 2 \\ , , $ ] and compute three measures of overdispersion :    @xmath58 ^ 2}{n_\\dt\\mu_j(\\dt ) } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if the light curve fluctuations are fully explained as poisson fluctuations , we must have @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , since the variance of a poisson process is equal to its mean . , and as demonstrated explicitly in  [ s : hz43 ] . ] in contrast , if an additional process is operating to cause variations in the source intensity , we must have @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    ".average overdispersion [ t : overdisp ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the  dataset , computing the overdispersion measures for all obsids , for a variety of time binning sizes ( @xmath49  s ) , we find that the latter condition holds ( figure  [ f : overdisp ] ; see also table  [ t : overdisp ] ) for the majority of the cases . in each case",
    ", we compute the error bars on @xmath51 via monte carlo simulations of the null model , and thereby determine the significance of each measurement of the overdispersion measure by calibrating the statistic independently for the specific values of @xmath65 .",
    "thus , we find that in most of the observations , the overdispersion is significant , and hence that the observed variations in the capella light curves can not be explained as due only to poisson fluctuations . in particular , we find @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 as the range of the medians over the entire dataset for the three different bin sizes considered .",
    "the overdispersions tend to increase with @xmath69 , as is expected because the relative statistical error decreases with increasing counts .",
    "the averages and the standard deviations are reported in table  [ t : overdisp ] for each @xmath29 , and show that the result is robust over different methods and binning sizes .",
    "the measured points are in every case except one greater than the nominal value for the null , and the large standard deviations arise from large deviations upward .",
    "thus we conclude that capella exhibits variability over durations that characterize the observations , i.e. , at timescales @xmath44  ks . more sophisticated analyses ( which are in progress ) are necessary to fully characterize this variability .",
    "these measurements suggest that the intrinsic variability has an effect that is of similar magnitude to the poisson process , and that we are able to detect it primarily because of the large count rates and because the large number of independent datasets allows us to check that all give similar results .",
    "our analysis does not allow a direct calculation of the intensity variations that result in these overdispersion values , but assuming a model with small deviations , we estimate that intensity variations of the order @xmath70 are consistent with the observed @xmath51 . since such intensity variations are of the same order as the expected poisson fluctuations in the light curves , it is not surprising that methods such as the kolmogorov - smirnoff test and fourier analysis fail to detect the existence of the subtle variability in the data . similarly , argiroffi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) place a @xmath71 limit on the variability at @xmath72 , based on  hrc - s / letgs data where capella has a count rate of @xmath73  . with the",
    ", count rates @xmath74 times higher are observed , which allows us to detect the existence of such variability at @xmath75 ( figure  [ f : overdisp ] ) .",
    "as the source position changes on the detector with each observation , and even during a single observation as it dithers across the detector , the source passes over regions with different quantum efficiencies ( qe ) .",
    "variations in the qe will lead to corresponding differences in the observed count rate , and may produce a false signal of variability . in comparing the source intensities from different obsids , we have taken the qe variations into account using the current best estimate of the  qe map , which is estimated to be accurate to @xmath76 across the detector ( posson - brown & donnelly 2004 ; figure  [ f : ctrt ] suggests that the relative error in the qe map is considerably lower ) .",
    "while computing the overdispersion measures however , we do not make such corrections in order to not bias the statistical estimates .",
    "instead , we estimate the contribution of the local variations in qe to the overdispersion by comparing the variances in the light curves generated with and without correcting for this effect : the observed @xmath77 increases by @xmath78 , which is negligible compared to the magnitude of the observed overdispersions ( figure  [ f : overdisp ] ) . as a further test ,",
    "we have carried out fourier transforms of the counts light curves ; these show no evidence of a periodic signal , as would be present at frequencies corresponding to the dither periods if qe variations were to make a significant contribution to the variability .",
    "in addition , we place a direct limit on the residual calibration uncertainty by comparing the analysis of capella with that of a known non - varying source , 43 .",
    "43  is a h - rich da white dwarf with a temperature @xmath79  kk ( dupuis et al .",
    "it has no known or expected variability , and thus serves as a comparison target to verify the effect of the residual calibration uncertainty .",
    "the source has been observed numerous times as a calibration target by  in the + letgs configuration , and has thus far been observed for a total of 31.3  ks at the nominal aimpoint .",
    "the observed count rate is 3.6  , and coincidentally the accumulated counts approximately matches the number of counts produced in any given capella obsid , making it an excellent proxy to test for the existence of any instrument - based variability .",
    "we measure the overdispersion in 43  at various bin sizes , set such that the same number of counts are expected in each bin as for the capella data .",
    "for instance the capella light curve binned at @xmath52  s is approximately matched by a 43  light curve binned at @xmath80  s ; i.e. , absent intrinsic variations , and assuming that the magnitude of the local qe variations are spatial scale independent , both curves should have identical statistical properties .",
    "we find that the 43  overdispersion measures are fully consistent with there being no intrinsic variability whatsoever ( see figure  [ f : overdisp ] ) , and thus serve to confirm the detection of overdispersion in the capella data .",
    "stellar coronae are generally considered to be analogous to the solar corona , in the sense that the x - ray emission arises from optically thin , collissionally excited plasma , which is organized in active regions by magnetic fields and is probably heated by magnetic reconnection events . in the case of capella ,",
    "the energetics indeed support this view : the surface area of both components is @xmath81 times that of the sun ( table  [ t : capella ] ) , and the x - ray luminosity is correspondingly higher , at @xmath81 times the solar luminosity at the peak of its activity cycle .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of a solar like atmosphere , with the coronae dominated by loops in active regions that cover a large fraction of the surface .",
    "however , the temperatures on capella s coronae are significantly hotter , and the strong emission component at @xmath82  mk has no corresponding structure on the sun .",
    "we have established above (   [ s : autocorr],[s : overdisp ] ) that capella exhibits variability over timescales ranging from @xmath83  ks .",
    "while the longer timescale variability could arise simply due to slow evolution of active regions , the variability at shorter timescales ( @xmath84  ks ) is likely due to the dynamical balance of heating events and cooling . because capella maintains its luminosity to within a few percent",
    ", it must be that heating and cooling events are in balance for the most part , and therefore the variability timescale must be matched to the total coronal heating rate changes , and hence to the radiative cooling timescales .",
    "( for typical coronal densities , conductive cooling is not a factor at these timescales . )",
    "we can estimate the physical characteristics of the capella coronae based on this correspondence .",
    "the cooling timescale , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the electron number density , and @xmath87 is the power emitted by a unit volume of the plasma at temperature @xmath88 . adopting a coronal temperature of @xmath89 , and a metallicity @xmath90 ( see brickhouse et al .",
    "2000 ) , the power emitted is @xmath91  ergs  @xmath92  s@xmath20 , and we estimate the coronal number density @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "this is consistent with the limit @xmath95  @xmath96 found by ness et al .",

    "this is comparable to the typical loop sizes seen on the sun , but is small compared to the density scale height on capella , @xmath100  cm .",
    "we assume here that the entire corona is part of the balance between the heating and cooling occuring at the detected variability timescales .",
    "it is possible however that there are multiple components of emission in the corona : the small timescale variability may be due to a small portion of the corona , e.g. , as in x - ray bright points on the sun , and the bulk of the emission may arise in a lower density component that cools slowly and is heated correspondingly slower and reaches to a height comparable to the density scale height",
    ". however , this scenario appears to be ruled out by the analysis of high - resolution euv spectra by sanz - forcada , brickhouse , & dupree ( 2003 ) , who suggest that the bulk of the plasma on capella is at high densities .",
    "note that while we have confined our attention to @xmath101  ks , we can not formally rule out variability at shorter timescales ( more sophisticated analyses are in progress )",
    ". such variability will act to increase the estimate for the coronal density @xmath86 and decrease the height of the emission layer @xmath102 .",
    "we speculate that the most probable scenario for emission on capella is one where it is dominated by numerous low - lying activity sites .",
    "we have analyzed a deep /  observation of the active binary capella to detect variability at timescales shorter than 50  ks .",
    "capella is a highly stable coronal source on which hitherto no short term variability had been seen , despite its relatively high activity level .",
    "the  is uniquely positioned to achieve this objective because it allows the measurement of large count rates ( @xmath13  ) with no pileup effects .",
    "the unprecedented data quality allows us to test for the existence of variability at timescales as short as 5  ks .",
    "we confirm the conclusion of argiroffi et al .",

    "( 2007 ) , and westbrook et al .",

    "<S> we analyze 205  ks of imaging data of the active binary , capella , obtained with the  high resolution camera imager ( hrc - i ) to determine whether capella shows any variability at timescales @xmath0  ks . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a clear signal for variability is present for timescales @xmath1  ks , and that the light curves show evidence for excess fluctuation over that expected from a purely poisson process . </S>",
    "<S> this overdispersion is consistent with variability at the 2 - 7% level , and suggests that the coronae on the binary components of capella are composed of low - density plasma and low - lying loops . </S>"
