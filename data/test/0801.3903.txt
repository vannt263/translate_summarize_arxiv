    "<S> a description of mesoscopic fluctuations of the pairing gap in finite - sized quantum systems based on periodic orbit theory is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the fluctuations are found to depend on quite general properties . </S>",
    "<S> we distinguish between systems where corresponding classical motion is regular or chaotic , and describe in detail fluctuations of the bcs gap as a function of the size of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is applied to different mesoscopic systems : atomic nuclei , metallic grains , and ultracold fermionic gases . </S>",
