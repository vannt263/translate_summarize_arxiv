    "there are large amounts of highly dynamic phenomena with various scales in the solar atmosphere , which are indicative of strong radiance increasing or proper motions of bright features ( dark when seen in absorption ) .",
    "plasma outflows are usually observed during those highly dynamic events .",
    "it is believed that they may contribute to both the coronal heating and solar wind generation @xcite .",
    "it is conventionally recognized that most of the plasma outflows are corresponding to both fast and slow solar winds .",
    "at least , these outflows may be one of the solar wind sources on the sun @xcite .",
    "for example , fast solar wind probably emanates from coronal holes @xcite .",
    "slow solar wind probably originates from the boundaries of coronal holes @xcite , helmet streamers @xcite , the edges of active regions @xcite and the open field regions in the quiet sun @xcite . due to the important roles of these plasma outflows in solar wind , the causes of these outflows with the velocity of tens to hundreds km s@xmath0 are worthy to be investigated .    since the launch of advanced space instruments such as solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) , transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) and h__inode _ _ ,",
    "the outflows along coronal loops / structures emanating from the boundary of active region have been observed and investigated more frequently . using extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) spectra obtained with the coronal diagnostic spectrometer ( cds ) on soho",
    ", @xcite presented significant plasma outflows along coronal and transition active region loops , with velocities of  50 km / s , or more .",
    "@xcite detected evident outflows along a bundle of coronal active region loops , with velocity ranging from 5 to 20 km / s .",
    "there is no obvious periodicity in this observation and they concluded that the outflows are a class of reconnection events , and postulated these mass flows are probably driven by small scale magnetic reconnection events occurring at the foot points of coronal loops . with the observations taken by the x - ray telescope ( xrt )",
    "onboard the h__inode _ _ , the outflows originating from the edge of an active region with a speed of @xmath1140 km s@xmath0 are identified by @xcite , and they concluded that these outflows are probably associated with open magnetic field lines and may contribute to the generation of slow solar wind .",
    "it is also should noticed that there are large areas of plasma outflows at the boundaries of active region revealed by the extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrometer ( eis ) on the h__inode _ _ spacecraft , and they were thought to be a possible candidate for the solar wind @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that outflows may originate from specific locations of the magnetic field topology where field lines display strong gradients of magnetic connectivity , namely , quasi - separatrix layer ( qsl ) . with the above observations ,",
    "the further characterization of outflows regions should be important for us to understand the fundamental physical processes that cause these outflows and then the production of the solar wind and mass flows into the corona . from the above works , we recognize that the magnetic reconnection probably plays a key role in the generation of plasm outflows . hence , the associations between plasma outflows and magnetic field evolutions should deserve to be further investigated .    in this paper , we study some events of plasma outflows in the coronal loops emanating from the boundaries of an active region , and find that the cancellation of small scale mixed magnetic fields at the boundary of the main active region causes the occurrence of the plasma outflows .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : the description of observations and data reduction and the results are arranged in section  [ s - obser and result ] .",
    "section  [ s - conl ] gives the discussions and conclusions .",
    "atmospheric imaging assembly and the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) @xcite are two main instruments onboard the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) .",
    "aia takes full - disk images of the sun in 3 uv - visible and 7 euv channels with a resolution of 0@xmath2.6 pixel@xmath0 .",
    "hmi obtains full - disk magnetograms in the photospheric absorption line centered at the wavelength 6173.3  with high spatial and temporal resolutions of 0@xmath2.6 pixel@xmath0 and 45 s , respectively . in this study ,",
    "the channels of 211  , 193  , 171  , 304  , 1600  and 1700  are used to detect the plasm outflows along the coronal loops rooted at the edge of ar noaa 11504 , which were observed about from 18:00 ut to 23:00 ut on june 14 2012 .",
    "it means the data sets cover the whole solar atmosphere from photosphere , chromosphere , transition regions to corona .",
    "we use the product of vector magnetograms projected and remapped to heliographic coordinates .",
    "the data processing is based on the standard solar softwares of these instruments .    in fig",
    "[ fig1 ] , images in the aia channels of 211  , 193  , 171  , 304  , 1600  and 1700  observed at about 18:00 ut on june 14 2012 are shown , respectively . the corresponding wavelength is plotted on each frame .",
    "the plasma outflows can be seen clearly in 211  , 193  , 171  and 304  channels with the temporal sequence data ( see one movie in 171  channel ) .",
    "the locations of coronal loops with outflows are shown by two green arrows in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "there are obvious bright dots or intensity enhancements along coronal loops during this observed time interval , and this phenomenon occurs intermittently .",
    "hence , these plasma outflows of interest are to be studied in present work .    in figure 2",
    ", panels ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the images of 171  , and one light of sight ( los ) magnetogram , respectively .",
    "two virtual slits along coronal loops with evident outflows are highlighted by two white lines ( s1 and s2 ) for further investigations .",
    "it can been seen that the coronal loops are rooted at the southeast edges of the main active region , where small - scale magnetic fields with positive polarity , adjacent to large - scale negative magnetic polarity of the main active region , are concentrated on .",
    "hence the interactions between the two magnetic systems with opposite polarities probably play an important role in the production of plasma outflows observed .",
    "time - distance diagrams of multi - channel observations for s1 and s2 slits are presented in fig [ fig3 ] , where x - axis indicates the time spanning from 18:00 ut to 23:00 ut , and y - axis means the distance along the marked coronal loops in fig [ fig2 ] .",
    "the slope of bright strips in the diagram means there are plasma outflows propagating along coronal loops .",
    "we can see that the signatures of outflows are most strong in the euv line of 171  , and relatively weak in the other euv lines ( of 211  , 193  and 304  ) .",
    "only a few strong outflows can be detected in the uv lines of 1600  and 1700  .",
    "therefore , the plasma outflows identified are mutli - thermal .    from top to bottom rows ,",
    "fig  [ fig4 ] shows three typical outflow events in aia 211  channel ( highlighted by three red circles drawn in fig [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the red / blue contours superimposed on each panel are positive / negative hmi los magnetic field .",
    "it can be found that those positions with obvious intensity enhancement ( conspicuous bright dots ) are exactly located in the regions of magnetic neutral line between the small - scale positive magnetic fields and the large - scale negative magnetic fields .",
    "similarly , these outflow events in the others channels of 193  , 171  and 304  , are shown in figs  [ fig5]-[fig7 ] , respectively .",
    "their counterparts in 1600  and 1700  channels are shown in figs 8 and 9 . however , the signatures of plasma propagating in the uv channels , especially in 1700  , nearly vanish . on the whole",
    ", the observations reveal that these plasma outflows can be easily detected at the upper solar atmosphere , and they are weak at the lower atmosphere .",
    "the evolutions of small - scale positive fields , from which the outflows are originated , are shown in fig  [ fig10](a ) .",
    "the evolution process can be described as follows : firstly , two white patches with stronger field strength ( denoted by the red contours ) appears at 17:59 ut , then they approach each other likely squeezed by the two black patches with negative polarity from two opposite directions ( shown by the two arrows ) .",
    "thus , the two white patches begin to combine together .",
    "subsequently , at 19:59 ut a small white patch begins to separate from the whole one . in the panels ,",
    "three dot lines delineating movement of the three patches with positive polarity are plotted , which can be used to estimate combining and separating speeds of the white patches .",
    "we obtain the combine speed in magnitude @xmath10.5 km s@xmath0 ( @xmath3+@xmath4=0.32 km s@xmath0 + 0.18 km s@xmath0 ) and the separation speed @xmath10.43 km s@xmath0 ( @xmath5+@xmath4=0.25 km s@xmath0 + 0.18 km s@xmath0 ) , respectively .    in panels ( b ) and ( c ) , the curves of the positive magnetic fluxes within the selected region indicated by a red rectangle in panel ( a ) are superimposed on the time - distance diagrams of the loops s1 and s2 in aia 304  channel to investigate the connections between outflows and magnetic flux changes .",
    "the positive fluxes are calculated , since it can be easily distinguished and their evolutions are more evident . on the whole , at first there is an increase in the positive fluxes likely due to the fields emerging and combining , then they decrease .",
    "it can be found that there is always a small variation of the fluxes corresponding to occurrence of the strong outflows .",
    "for example , five of them marked by the arrows of @xmath6 in panel ( b ) are all accompanied by a decreasing of the fluxes .",
    "while for the weak outflows , such corresponding relationship is not so evident .",
    "the decrease of positive fluxes should be due to the negative fluxes invading and cancelling with them .",
    "in this work with the multi - channel observations by sdo / aia and hmi , the plasma outflows and their associated magnetic fields are identified and investigated .",
    "it is found that these plasma outflows can be simultaneously detected in the channels of 211  , 193  , 171  and 304  , which means that the outflows are muti - thermal . by comparing spatial positions of the outflow originating and the mixed magnetic fields in fig  [ fig4]-[fig9 ]",
    ", it can be found that the evident intensity enhancements coincide with the locations of the magnetic neutral lines .",
    "the reconnection positions are likely located at regions higher than the photosphere as the plasma outflows can not be detected evidently there ( see the data in 1600  and 1700  ) .",
    "the height of reconnection occurring may depend on the positions where the two mixed magnetic systems meet and where the necessary conditions for magnetic reconnections are satisfied .",
    "for the current outflows in this work , the reconnection height should be higher than the photosphere ( nearly no signature in 1700  ) and roughly located at the bottom of the chromopshere ( weak signature in 1600  ) , but they can cause a multi - layer atmosphere response as shown by the simultaneous observations in aia 211  , 193  , 171  and 304  channels .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are that the plasma outflows detected in coronal loops should be the results of magnetic reconnections .",
    "the whole event can be explained simply by some cartoons shown in fig  [ fig11 ] . in panel ( a ) , blue lines correspond to the high - altitude open field lines rooted on the edges of main active region , and green lines represent the low - altitude closed field lines connecting two small scale magnetic polarities .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that the small scale magnetic fields , located close to the edges of the active region , begin to emerge from sub - photosphere .",
    "panel ( c ) shows that the reconnections occur between these two magnetic systems when the field lines of small scale magnetic fields reach the height of the large - scale open field lines .",
    "panel ( d ) displays that outflows are created along the new open field lines after magnetic reconnection , indicated by two yellow ellipses along the blue open field lines . here , we take the released magnetic energy as the driver for the plasmas outflows at alfven speeds , @xmath7 km s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the presence of these two opposite magnetic systems is of the essential condition for magnetic reconnection .",
    "the outflow events can also been interpreted as the interactions between emergence fluxes ( green closed lines ) with high density material and open fluxes ( blue lines ) with relative low density material due magnetic pressure gradient , consequently , a bundle of newly opened flux created that allowing significant outflows of escaping plasma @xcite .    this work is supported by the national basic research program of china under grant 2011cb8114001 , the natural science foundation of china ( grant nos .",
