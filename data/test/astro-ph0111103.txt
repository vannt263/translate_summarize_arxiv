    "understanding the formation of massive stars is crucial to an understanding of the formation of stars in general and of galaxies .",
    "many , perhaps most , stars form in clustered environments where massive stars are present ( lada 1992 , williams & mckee 1997 ) .",
    "only massive star formation is readily studied at the distances of other galaxies . in particular , the discovery",
    "that star formation at substantial redshifts is often heavily obscured by dust ( e.g. , frayer et al . 2000 ; chapman et al .",
    "2001 ) indicates that study of the history of star formation in galaxies , hence the major part of galaxy formation , can be related to what we learn about massive star formation in our own and nearby galaxies .",
    "here we consider a number of issues surrounding the formation of massive stars , beginning with a comparison to what we know about the formation of low mass stars , proceeding through some systematic studies of early stages of massive star formation , and ending with some speculations about the initial conditions for massive star formation .",
    "in the case of low mass stars , a well - established evolutionary paradigm prevails , and a standard model of star formation ( shu et al . 1987 ) provides a detailed target for observational tests .",
    "various alternative models have also been proposed and observers are beginning to compare these models to observations .",
    "the evolutionary paradigm is based on the class system ( lada & wilking 1984 , lada 1987 ) , originally proceeding from class i ( deeply embedded ) to iii ( revealed star , weak - line t tauri star ) via class ii ( roughly the same as classical t tauri stars ) .",
    "the recent advances in submillimeter capability have revealed a self - luminous phase that is still more embedded than class i , and andr , ward - thompson , & barsony ( 1993 ) called this phase class 0 .",
    "the initial conditions for low mass star formation appear to be amenable to study in dense regions without any evidence for internal luminosity . variously called pre - protostellar cores ( ppcs ) , pre - stellar cores , or class @xmath0 sources ,",
    "these objects first became obvious as peaks of submillimeter  emission .",
    "while they roughly coincide with molecular emission regions , the molecular line emission did not directly reveal the high densities , apparently because of substantial molecular depletion ( e.g. , caselli et al .",
    "2001 ) , caused by the high densities and low temperatures in the cores of these regions .",
    "the temperatures are low enough ( @xmath1 k ) that even the submillimeter  emission is decreased toward the centers ( evans et al . 2001 ) , but the dust continuum emission is much more revealing than the molecular line emission that has usually been used to trace dense regions .",
    "the extended class system relies on a mixture of slopes ( lada & wilking 1984 , lada 1987 ) , peaks , and ratios ( andr et al .",
    "1993 ) in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of dust emission .",
    "an alternative that unifies these methods and provides a continuous variable is the bolometric temperature ( ) introduced by myers & ladd ( 1993 ) .",
    "chen et al . ( 1995 ) showed that the class boundaries corresponded well to certain values of .",
    "however , , being defined by the spectrally averaged mean frequency , can be heavily affected by emission at relatively short wavelengths , where geometrical effects are conflated with evolutionary effects . for the early stages , there are two important boundaries : class @xmath0 to class 0 ; and class 0 to class i. there are usually insufficient measurements to define  for class @xmath0 sources ; the test for class @xmath0 status is that there is no evidence for internal luminosity . for the class 0/i boundary",
    ", one can use either @xmath2k ( chen et al . 1995 ) or the ratio of emission beyond 350 to total luminosity , @xmath3 ( andr et al . 1993 ) .",
    "to what extent can we carry the observational paradigm and theoretical models for low - mass star formation over to the case of massive star formation ?",
    "working with a modest sample size ( 14 ) , van der tak et al ( 2000 ) found rather poor correlations between different potential tracers of age .",
    "it is not very surprising that the sed may not correlate with evolution in the same way as for low mass stars ; for massive stars forming in clusters , the sed will be dominated by the most luminous object that is still embedded and the evolution of the various objects is unlikely to be highly synchronized .",
    "the class ii phase in particular may have little meaning : for low mass stars , this is the phase when the sed is dominated by a disk ; the presence of disks around massive stars is less firmly established .",
    "finally , the evolution of massive stars is so much faster that we can not expect the gentle unfolding of the sed as the dust moves from envelope to disk to star in the low mass case . instead , massive stars reach the main sequence , form hii regions , blow ionized winds , etc . before much of the material in the envelope has fallen in .",
    "what other evolutionary tracers might prove useful ? clearly , the emergence of an hii region , first as an ultra - compact hii region , marks an important evolutionary boundary .",
    "if we are looking for the earliest stages , we want to study sources before uc hii regions form .",
    "there are two general ideas for evolutionary tracers at earlier times : masers and chemical signatures .",
    "while oh masers appear to be associated with hii regions , h@xmath4o  and possibly ch@xmath5oh  ( e.g. , minier , conway , & booth 2001 ) masers appear to be associated with early stages , when molecular outflows produce shocks .",
    "hot cores ( warm , dense , chemically - rich regions ) also appear to precede uc hii regions ( see van der tak 2002 for a discussion of this approach ) .",
    "the hot cores could in principal be heated internally ( and hence analogous to class 0 sources ) or externally ( hence analogous to class @xmath0 sources ) .",
    "there have been many detailed studies of individual regions of massive star formation , but systematic studies of large samples of regions using uniform analytical methods are just becoming available ( e.g. , plume et al .",
    "1992 , 1997 , bronfman et al .",
    "1996 , sridharan et al . 2001 ) . in the next section",
    ", we report on recent work on the sample identified by plume et al .",
    "water masers provide a large sample of objects with accurate positions for further study ( e.g. , cesaroni et al .",
    "many masers are _ near _ uc hii regions , but their positions do not coincide , consistent with the masers revealing an earlier stage .",
    "in addition , the presence of a h@xmath4omaser ensures the existence of some very dense gas .",
    "the models of these masers also require shocks , suggesting that some star formation and associated outflow has begun .",
    "consequently , we have pursued a series of studies of the gas and dust in the directions of water masers , beginning with a survey for emission in the 76 transition of cs ( plume , jaffe , & evans 1992 ) .",
    "a large fraction of the maser sources were detected in the cs 76 survey , leading to a follow - up study using cs 21 , 32 , 54 , and in a few cases , @xmath6 transitions to constrain the density via lvg calculations of the molecular excitation ( plume et al .",
    "1997 ) . for many sources ,",
    "c@xmath7s data provided a check on optical depth effects in cs .",
    "that study found high densities in many sources , with a mean in the log of density , @xmath8 , of @xmath9 , with the average taken over 71 sources .",
    "plume et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also mapped a few sources crudely ( cross - scans ) to estimate sizes and masses . to obtain better data on sizes , masses of dense gas , density distributions , etc .",
    ", we have made fully sampled maps of a large fraction of the plume et al",
    "we mapped 63 regions in cs 54 ( shirley et al .",
    "2002 ) and 24 regions in cs 76 ( knez et al .",
    "in addition , we have mapped the 350  continuum emission from dust toward 51 of these regions ( mueller et al .",
    "details of the observations and analysis can be found in those papers , and a more complete study of one of the objects can be found in lee et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . here",
    "we focus on the overall results , summarizing and comparing the results from the different tracers , while accounting for differences among the samples in the different studies .",
    "for all the samples , the fwhm size of each core was determined by deconvolving the telescope main beam fwhm from the observed fwhm of the core . in most cases ,",
    "the deconvolved angular sizes determined in this way were slightly larger than the beam size , characteristic of a power - law emission distribution ( terebey et al .",
    "1993 ) . also , the cs 76 sizes were smaller than the cs 54 sizes , as expected for a centrally peaked density distribution because the critical density for the 76  line is 3 times greater than that for the 54 line ( cf .",
    "evans 1999 ) . for power law distributions , the size defined in this way should not be considered a physical boundary .",
    "instead , we use it , along with the distance , to calculate a fiducial radius for convenient comparisons .    similarly , the mass in a power law distribution can only be specified for a given radius ; when comparing masses from various techniques , it is important to compare for the same fiducial radius . because the cs 54maps have the largest extents , thus tracing the core farther down the density distribution , we compare all masses calculated to be inside the radius of the cs emission : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the fwhm angular extent of the map of cs 54  emission and @xmath12 is the distance .      the modeling follows the scheme represented by figure 1 , though at present some of the processes are incompletely implemented .",
    "the modeling of the dust emission is described by mueller et al .",
    "a density power law ( @xmath13 ) is assumed , a radiative transport code is used to compute a self - consistent , and the resulting  and @xmath14 are used to compute the dust emission over the full sed . for comparison with maps of submillimeter  continuum emission ,",
    "the emission is convolved with the measured beam response and chopping is simulated .",
    "comparison of the predicted intensity profile to that obtained in the observations allows one to choose the best fitting power law index for the density .",
    "comparison to the observed integral of the sed constrains the internal luminosity of the forming stars , while comparison to the emission at submillimeter  wavelengths constrains @xmath15 and hence the mass .",
    "the mass also depends on the assumed opacity at 350  ( @xmath16 ) , and the overall shape of the sed depends on the full behavior of the dust opacity as a function of frequency ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we assume the dust opacities given in column 5 of ossenkopf and henning ( 1994 ) , hereafter oh5 , but divide by 100 so that are given per gram of total mass ( gas plus dust ) .",
    "these opacities have fit the seds from both low - mass ( evans et al .",
    "2001 , shirley et al . 2001 ) and high - mass ( van der tak et al .",
    "2000 ) star formation regions .",
    "they are appropriate for grains that have coagulated at high density and accreted thin ice mantles .",
    "different choices for opacities make little difference in the optimum @xmath18 , but they do affect the mass because only the product @xmath19 enters the equation for the dust emission .    for the 28 sources with models , mueller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find a mean density index of @xmath20 , with a distribution shown in figure 2 ( left panel ) .",
    "this value is considerably larger than that found by van der tak et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who modeled a subset of these sources . for that earlier work ,",
    "the beam was approximated as a gaussian , while the observed beam , including azimuthally averaged sidelobes , was used in the models by mueller et al .",
    "for sharply peaked intensity distributions , the details of the beam profile make a substantial difference ; source - by - source comparison indicates that mueller et al .",
    "find values of @xmath18 larger than those found by van der tak et al . by about 0.4 on average .",
    "the  found by mueller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is consistent within the uncertainties with that found by beuther et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( @xmath21 ) for a differently - selected sample of regions forming massive stars .",
    "these power - law indices are also similar in the mean to those found for isolated cores forming low mass stars ( shirley et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; young et al . 2001 ; motte & andr 2001 ) . in figure 2 , right panel , we show the histogram for the combined sample of low - mass cores modeled by shirley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and young et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , for which @xmath22 .",
    "while the means agree , the distributions may be different , though larger samples are still needed .",
    "the low - mass regions primarily have @xmath23 ; the smaller peak between 1 and 1.5 is composed of sources that are quite aspherical .",
    "the distribution of @xmath18 for regions forming massive stars appears to have a larger intrinsic spread .",
    "the detailed modeling of the cs emission ( knez et al .",
    "2002 ) is at an early stage , with only one source ( m8e ) modeled , and some of the processes in the bottom loop of figure 1 are incompletely implemented . in particular",
    ", we use the  from the dust modeling and currently assume @xmath24 ( a good assumption at the densities probed by cs emission ) . the turbulent velocity dispersion is assumed to be constant , and no systematic motions ( e.g. , collapse ) are assumed . instead of running a chemical model , we assume a constant cs abundance , which is adjusted to match the optically thin emission from c@xmath7s 54 .",
    "various values of @xmath18 were used to allow a determination independent from that of the dust emission .",
    "for m8e , the cs prefers a slightly lower value of @xmath18 than the dust : 1.6 rather than 1.75 .",
    "given the uncertainties and the assumptions , these are in quite good agreement .",
    "mueller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find a mean mass of gas and dust based on the dust emission within the fwhm of the 350  emission , @xmath25 . because the submillimeter  emission has the smallest beam , and because the submillimeter  sample does not include the more massive cores in the full sample , this mass is much less than the mean virial mass , @xmath26 , determined from the cs emission ( shirley et al .",
    "in addition , that estimate of virial mass assumed constant density and used the fwhm velocity width of the cs 54 line , which is broadened by optical depth effects .",
    "we can correct the virial mass @xmath27 for the density power law index , according to ( bertoldi & mckee 1992 ) ,    @xmath28    where the factor 8ln2 comes from converting from mean square velocity to fwhm linewidth ( @xmath29 ) , and @xmath30 is the radius defined above for the cs 54 emission .",
    "for this calculation , we use the fwhm of the c@xmath7s line , which corrects for saturation broadening of the cs lines .",
    "preliminary comparisons of @xmath31cs and c@xmath7s spectra indicate that c@xmath7s 54 linewidths are not broadened due to optical depth effects .    for comparison",
    ", we calculate the total mass based on the model of the dust emission , but integrated out to the same radius ( @xmath30 ) as used for the virial mass : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mean molecular mass and @xmath15 is the density at @xmath34 . because the value of @xmath15 is fixed by matching the observed flux density at 350 , @xmath35 .",
    "the ratio of the virial mass to the total ( gas and dust ) mass determined from the dust modeling then depends on measured and assumed quantities as follows : @xmath36 for the 18 sources with all the required data and models , @xmath37 ( see figure 3 ) . because the opacities from different dust models vary by up to a factor of 10 ( e.g. , ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) , this discrepancy is not very large .",
    "the agreement of the two very different mass estimates at this level suggests that both the assumptions underlying the virial mass estimate and the oh5 opacities at 350 are quite good .",
    "a factor of about 2 decrease in @xmath16 from the oh5 value would bring them into agreement on average .",
    "based on the good agreement of the masses on average , we calculated the virial masses for the rest of the sample , assuming the mean value of @xmath18 and correcting for linewidth broadening in the cs 54  line statistically ( shirley et al .",
    "the resulting mass distribution has a mean value of @xmath38 .",
    "recall that this number refers to the mass inside @xmath30 ; if the core extends to twice this radius with the same power law in density , the estimate of @xmath27 grows by a factor of 2 , while the mass from dust emission grows by @xmath39 or a factor of 2.4 for the mean @xmath18 , leading to estimates of 4000 to 4900 , for the mean mass . while the mass histogram appears peaked , selection effects against small sources are present at the mean distance of sources in this sample : @xmath40 kpc . for sources above 1000 ,",
    "the distribution could be fitted by a power law in mass with an exponent of 1.8 to 2.0 ( shirley et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "evolutionary indicators ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath18 ) for the water maser sample and for low mass protostars observed with scuba at 850 and 450 @xmath43 ( young et al .",

    "2001 , shirley et al .",
    "2000 ) are plotted in figure 4 .",
    "based on the evolutionary scheme for low mass star formation , @xmath41 would be expected to increase while @xmath42 would decrease as the envelope dissipates .",
    "indeed , for low mass protostars , these trends seem to hold for a small sample of sources in the most embedded phases of evolution ( ppc through class i ) .",
    "the water maser sources weakly follow a similar trend ; however , the water maser sample does not cover as wide a range in @xmath41 and @xmath42 as the low mass core sample .",
    "preliminary analysis of dust models for both high and low mass cores do not indicate a strong correlation of the density power law index , @xmath18 , with @xmath41 .",
    "both samples are biased towards more embedded regions and therefore sample a restricted range of @xmath41 and @xmath42 . each indicator has a different dependence of geometrical effects , such as outflow cavities , clumping , etc . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are determined from the sed , while the density power law index , @xmath18 , probes the density distribution in a different way .",
    "while larger samples covering a wider range of the evolutionary parameters are needed , it seems that the traditional evolutionary indicators for low mass star formation may have some utility for massive stars , at least at the early ( class 0 and i ) stages .",
    "the results so far from the study of water maser sources indicate that conditions in regions forming massive stars are quite different from those in regions forming low mass stars .",
    "the total mass of dense ( @xmath44 ) gas is much greater , the turbulence is much higher for a given size , and , once stars have formed , the temperature is much higher . for the subset of sources with adequate data ,",
    "the luminosity to mass ratio is @xmath45 @xmath46 for the mass of _ dense _ gas determined from the virial mass within @xmath30 . for the masses based on the dust emission ,",
    "the same ratio is @xmath47 @xmath46",
    ". the latter number may be more relevant for comparison to observations of distant galaxies where long wavelength dust emission is used to trace mass .",
    "these numbers are for 18 sources that have models for the dust emission , and are still preliminary until more sources can be added .",
    "these values for @xmath48 are much higher than that inferred from co studies , which provide masses for the whole molecular cloud . the average value from co studies is @xmath49 /  ( mooney & solomon 1988 ) and the distribution spreads over a factor of @xmath50 ( evans 1991 ) .",
    "the dense gas provides a much better guide to the star formation rate and efficiency , consistent with the conclusions of gao & solomon ( 2000 ) , who showed that hcn correlates much better than co with star formation indicators in a large sample of galaxies .",
    "the @xmath48 for dense gas is comparable to the values inferred for starburst galaxies , based on co emission : @xmath51 ( kennicutt 1998 , sanders et al .",
    "starburst galaxies appear to form stars as if a large fraction of their molecular gas content behaves like the dense cores associated with water masers .",
    "so far , all the regions studied already have ongoing star formation . what initial conditions lead to the conditions in the observed regions ? by analogy with the pre - protostellar cores ( ppcs ) for low mass star formation , the initial conditions for massive , clustered star formation might be referred to as pre - proto - cluster cores ( ppclcs , an acronym chosen deliberately to avoid its future use ) . based on the mean properties of the h@xmath4o  maser sample , we would expect the following properties",
    ". they would be dense ( @xmath44 ) and massive ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the linewidth is a question : if the turbulence is stirred up by star formation , it could be less before star formation begins ; however , the virial linewidth for a core of the mean mass would be 7.5 . before an internal luminosity source develops , the ppclc should be very cold on the inside because it is heated only externally by the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "studies of low - mass ppcs indicate  dropping to 78 k at the center ( evans et al .",
    "2001 , zucconi et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "so far , we have no clear examples of such objects ! there are less massive candidates , but nothing we have found in the literature approaches these properties .",
    "why do we lack examples ?",
    "there are several possible explanations :    1 .",
    "ppclcs will be very rare .",
    "2 .   appropriate searches have not been made .",
    "3 .   ppclcs never exist .",
    "the first explanation arises because massive star formation is rare in general and because ppclcs should evolve rapidly to form stars .",
    "the second explanation can certainly be part of the answer .",
    "the low mass ppcs were found only recently , using submillimeter  continuum observations of starless cores originally identified by visual obscuration .",
    "while molecular line emission identified the general region , the high densities in the ppcs became apparent only with submillimeter  dust emission studies .",
    "the molecular tracers fail to trace the densest regions of ppcs , apparently because of a combination of opacity and heavy depletion onto dust ( e.g. , kramer et al .",
    "1999 , caselli et al .",
    "2001 ) . because no obvious signposts like maser emission mark the ppclcs , unbiased submillimeter  surveys of large regions of distant molecular clouds are needed to find them . while such surveys are becoming possible and should be attempted , it is only fair to note the third explanation .",
    "regions forming clusters may never go through a ppclc phase if lower - mass stars form while the full mass is being assembled . in that case , one might see various signposts of lower mass star formation ( outflows , infrared emission ) associated with a _",
    "cluster _ of cores that are merging to form the truly massive cores observed at later stages .    some possible candidates for ppclcs may be found from large scale surveys .",
    "for example , lada et al .",
    "( 1991 ) surveyed 3.6 square degrees of the l1630 cloud in cs 21  emission , finding numerous dense cores .",
    "the large cores all had ongoing star formation ; follow - up studies ( lada et al . 1997 ) showed that the starless cores were all of modest mass ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the most promising candidates at present are the mid - infrared - dark clouds found by the msx mission that lack iras emission ( egan et al .",
    "follow - up studies using h@xmath4co ( carey et al .",
    "1998a ) found massive ( @xmath54 ) , cold ( @xmath55 k ) cores with @xmath44 .",
    "maps of the submillimeter dust emission ( carey et al .",
    "1998b ) showed a string of cores , some of which harbor molecular outflows .",
    "the outflows indicate that some star formation may have begun , but these objects at least seem to be at a very early evolutionary stage .      to provide a target for possible searches , we have constructed a model of a ppclc based on the mean properties of the h@xmath4o  maser sample : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 kpc .",
    "the outer radius of the model was taken to be 0.76 pc , twice the mean radius from the cs maps . at the mean distance of 5.5 kpc",
    ", this radius translates to @xmath59 .",
    "the dust temperature was assumed constant at 10 k ; while models of ppcs indicate lower  in the center , ppclcs may exist in regions of higher radiation fields .",
    "oh5 opacities were assumed .",
    "observations of the model with various past , current , and future instruments were simulated .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the solid line is the total emission , while the circles show the emission into the beam of the instrument .",
    "the horizontal bars show the limits for 1 sec of integration .",
    "it is not surprising that iras did not detect these objects ; sirtf could detect them at 160 , but that channel will be saturated for most regions of molecular gas just from the extended cloud emission . the best regime in which to search for such objects is the millimeter to submillimeter , and systems with fairly large beams and fields of view are ideal for the large - scale blind surveys that will be needed .",
    "a good example of such an instrument is bolocam , operating on the cso ( glenn et al .",
    "the formation of massive stars occurs in parts of molecular clouds that are much denser and more turbulent than the bulk of the molecular gas . compared to the regions forming low mass stars ,",
    "the birthplaces of massive stars have high densities over much larger regions and their linewidths are much greater than those inferred from the linewidth - size relation .",
    "a clear evolutionary sequence is difficult to establish , but regions surrounding water masers should be younger than those around ultra - compact hii regions .",
    "studies based on h@xmath4o  masers find a distribution of masses of dense ( @xmath44 ) gas that extends to quite large masses . while affected by selection biases , a mean value of 20004000 is found , enough to form large clusters of stars .",
    "modeling the radial profiles of submillimeter  emission from dust indicates that power laws in density ( @xmath60 ) fit the data with a mean @xmath57 , rather similar to that found for molecular cores around ultra - compact hii regions ( beuther et al .",
    "2001 ) and to low mass star - forming cores ( shirley et al . 2001 ; young et al . 2001 ) .",

    "<S> our knowledge of the initial conditions and early stages of high mass star formation is very limited . we will review recent surveys of regions in the early stages of massive star formation using molecular tracers of high density and dust continuum emission and consider the status of evolutionary schemes . </S>",
    "<S> comparison to the situation for low mass , relatively isolated star formation will be used to illustrate the outstanding issues in massive star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of initial conditions is particularly acute because there is a lack of observational evidence for regions capable of forming massive stars _ before _ </S>",
    "<S> star formation actually begins . by analogy with the pre - protostellar cores ( ppcs ) </S>",
    "<S> studied for low - mass star formation , one might call such regions pre - proto - cluster cores ( ppclcs ) </S>",
    "<S> . we will conclude with some speculation about what such cores might look like and possibilities for their detection . </S>"
