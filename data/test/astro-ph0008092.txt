    "two types of activity , active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and starburst , are thought to contribute to the far - infrared emission of irlgs .",
    "the estimate of the relative energetic contributions of these kinds of activity is an important issue for understanding the nature of irlgs .",
    "furthermore , since the bulk of the cosmic submillimeter background emission can be explained by irlgs at high - redshift ( blain et al .",
    "1999 ) , understanding the energy sources of nearby irlgs is closely related to the origin of the background emission .",
    "both agn and starburst activity produces strong emission lines . since many emission lines , such as narrow emission lines of hydrogen or h@xmath9 molecules ,",
    "can be caused by both kinds of activity , it is not easy to distinguish their origin . the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features can be a powerful tool for separating these kinds of activity and estimating their relative importance because the features are associated only with starburst activity and not with agn activity ( moorwood 1986 ) . using the pah emission feature at 7.7 @xmath0 m , systematic studies of the energy sources of irlgs have been reported based on the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) spectra at 5.811.6 @xmath0 m ( lutz et al .",

    "the observed ratios between the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah peak flux and 7.7 @xmath0 m continuum flux of irlgs were estimated to be as high as those of starburst galaxies with lower far - infrared luminosities , leading these authors to suggest that starburst activity is a dominant energy source for most of the irlgs they observed . however , the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah to far - infrared luminosity ratios of irlgs are roughly half of those of starburst galaxies ( genzel & cesarsky 2000 ) .",
    "this indicates that observed starburst activity can account for only half of the far - infrared luminosities for irlgs , although higher dust extinction toward starburst activity in irlgs could make the intrinsic contribution of starburst activity higher .    in the 5.811.6 @xmath0 m spectra of irlgs ,",
    "particularly obscured ones , not only the pah emission , but also broad silicate dust absorption , is likely to exist at 813 @xmath0 m ( mathis 1990 ) .",
    "limited wavelength coverage of most _ iso _ spectra ( 5.811.6 @xmath0 m ) does not allow the determination of a secure continuum level for many irlgs and thus the estimate of the pah flux could be quantitatively uncertain , as mentioned in rigopoulou et al . ( 1999 ) .",
    "in fact , the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah emission flux of arp 220 , an irlg for which an _ iso _ spectrum with wider wavelength coverage ( 516 @xmath0 m ) is available , could be considerably smaller than that estimated by rigopoulou et al .",
    ", if the continuum level is determined in a different way ( elbaz et al .",
    "1998 ; dudley 1999 ) . furthermore ,",
    "in the case of another irlg , iras 05189@xmath102524 , the reported equivalent widths of the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah emission feature based on the _ iso _ spectrum differ by a factor of @xmath113 according to different authors ( clavel et al .",
    "2000 ; laureijs et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "spectroscopy in the range 34 @xmath0 m can be a powerful method for investigating the energy source of irlgs , by avoiding the above uncertainty .",
    "first , since dust extinction at 34 @xmath0 m is estimated to be as small as that at 78 @xmath0 m",
    "( @xmath12/@xmath13 @xmath3 0.8 ; lutz et al .",
    "1996 ) , we can detect signs of obscured energy sources .",
    "next , we can diagnose the relative importance of agn and starburst activity using spectral features in the range 34 @xmath0 m .",
    "if an irlg is powered by starburst activity , pah emission should be detected at 3.3 @xmath0 m and sometimes at 3.4 @xmath0 m ( tokunaga et al .",
    "if a source is powered by obscured agn activity , a 3.4 @xmath0 m absorption feature of carbonaceous dust grains should be detected ( pendleton et al . 1994 ) , as found in some sources ( e.g. , ngc 1068 ; bridger , wright & geballe 1994 ; imanishi et al .",
    "if a source is powered by unobscured agn activity , a 34 @xmath0 m spectrum should be nearly featureless .",
    "figure 1 summarizes the expected spectral shapes for the above three cases and for the cases of composites of agn and starburst activity . finally , since a continuum level both longward and shortward of these features at 3.33.4 @xmath0 m is observable in the @xmath14-band ( 2.84.2 @xmath0 m ) atmospheric window of earth for nearby ( _ z _",

    "there is currently an increasing amount of evidence based on high spatial resolution imaging studies of infrared 225 @xmath0 m continuum emission that the bulk of the huge dust emission luminosities of irlgs come from compact ( @xmath15 a few 100 pc ) regions powered either by agn and/or compact starburst activity , with little contribution from extended regions ( surace & sanders 1999 ; surace , sanders , & evans 2000 ; scoville et al .",
    "2000 ; soifer et al .",
    "thus , ground - based 34 @xmath0 m spectroscopy can fully diagnose the properties of dust emission from the energetically important compact regions in most irlgs .",
    "the present study reports ground - based spectroscopy in the wavelength range 34 @xmath0 m of nine irlgs to investigate their energy sources .",
    "to achieve signal - to - noise ratios higher than 1020 with a few hours of on - source integration time using the 3.8-m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) , irlgs brighter than 11 mag at @xmath14 or @xmath16 were selected .",
    "the targets are summarized in table 1 .",
    "a total of nine irlgs were observed .",
    "far - infrared luminosities are higher than @xmath310@xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 .",
    "in addition to the irlgs , ngc 253 , a nearby ( @xmath33 mpc ; tully 1988 ) galaxy , was also observed .",
    "the emission properties of ngc 253 can be explained by starburst activity only ( e.g. , rieke et al .",
    "1980 ; engelbracht et al . 1998 ) , and no strong agn activity has been found . although its far - infrared luminosity ( table 1 ) is more than an order of magnitude smaller than those of the irlgs , this source is powered by compact ( @xmath3100 pc ) starburst activity ( kalas & wynn - williams 1994 ) .",
    "ngc 253 is thus an important nearby source for studying the nature of compact starburst activity found in irlgs , and its 34 @xmath0 m spectrum can be used as a template of compact starburst activity .",
    "we used the cooled grating spectrometer ( cgs4 ; mountain et al .",
    "1990 ) to obtain 34 @xmath0 m spectra of the irlgs and ngc 253 with ukirt on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "an observing log is summarized in table 2 .",

    "the detector was a 256 @xmath17 256 insb array .",
    "the 40 l mm@xmath6 grating with 2 pixels wide slit (= 1@xmath18 ) was used .",
    "the resulting spectral resolution was @xmath3750 at 3.5 @xmath0 m .",

    "a standard telescope nodding technique was employed along the slit to subtract the signal from the sky .",

    "the position angles of the slit used are summarized in table 2 . for irlgs that have clear double nuclei with a small separation ( @xmath15 several arcsec ; arp 220 , ngc 6240 , mrk 273 , and iras 08572 + 3915 ; scoville et al .",
    "2000 ) , the position angles were set so that signals from both the nuclei were observed simultaneously .",

    "standard data analysis procedures were employed using iraf .",
    "first , data of bad pixels were replaced with the interpolated signals of the surrounding pixels .",
    "next , bias was subtracted from the obtained frames and the frames were divided by a flat image . then , the spectra of the targets and the standard stars were extracted . since a secondary nucleus was not clearly recognizable as a distinct nucleus in all cases , spectra were extracted by integrating signals over 8@xmath1920@xmath19 along the slit ( table 3 ) . wavelength calibration was performed using an argon or a krypton lamp , and is believed to be accurate within 0.005 @xmath0 m .",
    "the galaxy spectra were divided by those of the standard stars , and were multiplied by the spectra of blackbodies with temperatures corresponding to individual standard stars ( table 2 ) .",
    "after flux calibration based on the adopted standard star fluxes , the final spectra were produced .",
    "the flux - calibrated spectra are shown in figure 2 .",
    "spectra for some irlgs were available in the literature , and the new spectra generally agree with previously published spectra .",
    "detailed comparisons of our spectra with previous ones are found in appendix a.    the comparison of the magnitudes of the cgs4 data with those in the literature is summarized in table 3 .",
    "the magnitudes of irlgs based on the cgs4 data roughly agree with photometric magnitudes measured with larger apertures , suggesting that nearly all of previously measured 34 @xmath0 m emission is also detected in the cgs4 data .",
    "the spectra of ic 694 , arp 220 , ngc 6240 , and mrk 273 are dominated by the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission and no detectable 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption , as in the case of ngc 253 .",

    "the spectrum of iras 08572 + 3915 is dominated by the 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption feature ( @xmath25 @xmath3 0.9 ) . neither detectable 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission nor the 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption is found in the spectra of iras 20460 + 1925 and iras 23060 + 0505 . the fluxes and luminosities of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature are summarized in table 4 .",

    ", we attribute the flux excess at 3.71 @xmath0 m as h@xmath9 00 s(15 ) emission line ( rest wavelength = 3.626 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "its flux is 1 @xmath17 10@xmath26 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath27 .",
    "ngc 6240 is known to show strong h@xmath9 emission lines whose strength ratios can be approximated by thermal excitation with the temperature of @xmath32000 k ( sugai et al .",
    "the comparison with the h@xmath9 10 s(0 ) flux ( 1.8 @xmath17 10@xmath28 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath27 ) measured with a 3@xmath19 @xmath17 6@xmath19 aperture ( goldader et al .",
    "1995 ) provides the 00 s(15 ) to 10 s(1 ) flux ratio of 0.06 .",
    "this ratio is similar to that found in shock gas in the orion molecular outflow where the h@xmath9 line ratios are roughly fitted by 2000 k thermal emission ( brand et al .",
    "in irlgs , agn activity and compact starburst activity are likely to coexist spatially close to each other .",
    "if energetic ionizing photons from agn activity penetrate the compact starburst regions and destroy pahs ( voit 1992 ) that otherwise should produce the strong 3.3 @xmath0 m emission feature , the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah luminosity could be small in spite of the presence of strong compact starburst activity .",
    "however , in irlgs , the destruction of pahs in the starburst regions by energetic photons from agn activity probably does not occur because of the large column density and high pressures in the interstellar medium ( maloney 1999 ) . in the following discussion",
    ", it is assumed that compact starburst activity in the irlgs produces the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission intrinsically as strongly as the star - formation activity in starburst galaxies with lower far - infrared luminosities , namely , in proportion to the far - infrared luminnosities .      for starburst - dominated galaxies , the rest - frame equivalent widths of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature ( ew@xmath29 ) do not change significantly as a result of dust extinction because flux attenuation of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission and 34 @xmath0 m continuum is similar .",
    "thus very small ew@xmath30 values are most likely caused by the contribution of agn activity to the 34 @xmath0 m continuum emission .",
    "the rest - frame ew@xmath29 values of the nine irlgs are summarized in table 4 .",
    "the value for ngc 253 is 120 nm , which is nearly a median value for starburst - dominated galaxies ( moorwood 1986 ) .",
    "if the scatter of the values is taken into account and irlgs with ew@xmath29 = 60240 nm are regarded as candidate starburst - dominated galaxies , then only ic 694 , arp 220 , and ngc 6240 have ew@xmath29 values as high as those of starburst galaxies , and are thus candidate starburst - dominated galaxies .",
    "mrk 273 shows a factor of @xmath312 smaller value than those of starburst galaxies and thus agn activity is estimated to contribute @xmath3150% of the 34 @xmath0 m continuum flux .",
    "the remaining five irlgs ( mrk 231 , iras 05189@xmath102524 , iras 08572 + 3915 , iras 23060 + 0505 , and iras 20460 + 1925 ) have ew@xmath29 ratios more than an order of magnitude smaller , indicating that @xmath1190% of the 34 @xmath0 m continuum flux originates in agn activity . since the far - infrared to 34 @xmath0 m flux ratio of dust emission heated by agn activity through a radiative transfer mechanism depends strongly on dust radial density distribution ( ivezic , nenkova & elitzur 1999 ) , conversion from the agn contribution at 34 @xmath0 m to that at far - infrared wavelengths",
    "is not certain .",
    "however , the ew@xmath29 values for these six irlgs ( mrk 273 and the five irlgs ) give no evidence that they are powered predominantly by compact starburst activity .      in @xmath325.1 ,",
    "three irlgs have ew@xmath29 values as high as those of starburst galaxies .",
    "however , large ew@xmath29 values of the irlgs do not necessarily mean that their far - infrared luminosities are powered predominantly by starburst activity .",
    "although highly obscured agn activity can contribute to the observed far - infrared luminosity because of negligible extinction in this wavelength range , the contribution of the highly obscured agn to the 34 @xmath0 m flux can be highly attenuated . as shown in figure 1@xmath33 , the apparent spectral shapes of galaxies powered both by starburst and highly obscured agn activity could be nearly the same as those powered only by starburst activity ( fig .",
    "1@xmath34 ) .    a straightforward means of estimating the energy contribution of compact starburst activity is to estimate the absolute 3.3 @xmath0 m pah luminosity and compare it with the far - infrared luminosity .",
    "the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission to far - infrared luminosity ratios ( @xmath1/@xmath2 ) of the irlgs are summarized in table 4 .",
    "the ratios of nearby starburst galaxies with lower far - infrared luminosity are estimated to be @xmath31 @xmath17 10@xmath35 ( mouri et al .",
    "1990 ) , although the scatter in this ratio is difficult to estimate because , in the case of nearby starburst galaxies , the ratios are affected by different aperture sizes between 34 @xmath0 m and far - infrared data ( mouri et al .",
    "the observed @xmath1/@xmath2 ratios for all nine irlgs are less than 3 @xmath17 10@xmath36 , a factor of @xmath113 smaller than those of starburst galaxies . the smaller ratios for the six irlgs with small ew@xmath29 values can be explained naturally by a dominant contribution of agn activity , while a few mechanisms can explain the smaller ratios in the three irlgs with large ew@xmath29 values ( ic 694 , arp 220 , and ngc 6240 ) .",
    "if highly obscured agn activity contributes significantly to the far - infrared luminosity but little to the 34 @xmath0 m flux due to high flux attenuation , then the large ew@xmath29 values and the small @xmath1/@xmath2 ratios can be explained .",
    "this is the first possible mechanism .",
    "a second mechanism is the effect of possible signal loss in the cgs4 data",
    ". the possible signal loss for ngc 6240 could be as high as 0.5 mag or a factor of 1.6 , while that for ic 694 and arp 220 is a factor of @xmath371.2 .",
    "provided that spectral shape outside the cgs4 slit is the same as that inside it , the possible slit loss could decrease the @xmath1/@xmath2 ratios only slightly .",
    "a third possible mechanism is the effect of dust extinction .",
    "the @xmath1/@xmath2 ratios for starburst - dominated irlgs could be smaller than those of starburst galaxies with lower far - infrared luminosities if dust extinction toward compact starburst activity in the irlgs is much higher .",
    "for ic 694 , arp 220 , and ngc 6240 , dust extinction toward starburst regions in the case of a foreground dust screen model could be as high as @xmath38 @xmath3 20 mag ( sugai et al . 1999 ; alonso - herrero et al .",

    "provided that the @xmath1/@xmath2 ratios of control starburst galaxy samples suffer the effect of dust extinction with @xmath38 @xmath3 10 mag ( rigopoulou et al .",
    "1999 , fig .",
    "7 ) , the intrinsic @xmath1/@xmath2 ratios of starburst - dominated galaxies are estimated to be 1.71.9 @xmath17 10@xmath35 . the intrinsic @xmath1/@xmath2 ratios for the three irlgs are a factor of @xmath33 smaller . for reference , the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah flux of ngc 253 within our slit is measured to be 2.8 @xmath17 10@xmath41 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath14-band magnitude inside our slit is 2.7 mag fainter than the total magnitude of this galaxy ( table 3 ) . if the 34 @xmath0 m spectrum shape outside the slit is the same as that inside it , and if @xmath38 = 14 mag is adopted as dust extinction toward starburst regions in this galaxy ( rigopoulou et al .",

    "2000 ) are a factor of @xmath36 larger than the estimate in this paper .",
    "if the larger values are the case , the bulk of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission detected in the _ iso _ spectrum must originate in extended star - forming regions outside the cgs4 slit .",
    "the extended star - formation regions could explain nearly all of the far - infrared luminosity of this source , if the value of @xmath1/@xmath2 = 1.71.9 @xmath17 10@xmath35 is adopted .",
    "however , this source shows no extended continuum emission at 225 @xmath0 m ( scoville et al .",
    "2000 ; soifer et al .",
    "if the extended regions are fully responsible for the far - infrared emission at 60 @xmath0 m but contribute to , say , less than 5% of the 25 @xmath0 m flux ( soifer et al . 2000 ) , then the 60 @xmath0 m to 25 @xmath0 m flux ratio in jy is @xmath1180 , much larger than any nearby star - forming galaxies ( rice et al .",
    "1988 ) . since the physical conditions in the extended regions of iras 05189@xmath102524",
    "( not nuclear compact regions that could have an extreme environment in density and so on ) are expected not to be quite different from those in nearby star - forming galaxies , such a sudden flux increase from the mid - infrared ( @xmath1525 @xmath0 m ) to far - infrared ( @xmath1140 @xmath0 m ) only in the case of iras 05189@xmath102524 is very unlikely .",
    "while the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah flux in this paper is estimated by tracing the spectral profile ( see the caption of table 4 for more details ) , clavel et al . simply sum up all the flux above the adopted continuum level in the pre - defined wavelength range ( j. clavel , private communication ) .",

    "spectrum provided by dr .",
    "clavel ( private communication ) shows a flux excess above an adopted continuum level at @xmath33.3 @xmath0 m , but it has lower spectral resolution ( r @xmath3 100 ) and larger scatter in data points at 34 @xmath0 m than the cgs4 spectrum .",
    "furthermore , although the wavelength of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature usually extends from 3.24 @xmath0 m to 3.34 @xmath0 m in the rest - frame ( tokunaga et al . 1991 ; this work ) , the flux excess in the _ iso _ spectrum is found from 3.25 @xmath0 m to 3.40 @xmath0 m ( not 3.34 @xmath0 m ) . if this excess is actually due to the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature , its spectral shape in the extended regions of iras 05189@xmath102524 is quite different from typical ones .",
    "more sensitive and higher spectral resolution spectroscopy with a wide aperture is necessary to address this issue .",
    "we tentatively consider that the extended regions contribute little to the total far - infrared luminosity of iras 05189@xmath102524 .",
    "soifer et al . ( 2000 ) suggested based on their 825 @xmath0 m imaging data that agn activity is the dominant energy source of mrk 231 , iras 05189@xmath102524 , and iras 08572 + 3915 .",
    "our suggestions are the same for these three sources .",
    "soifer et al . were unable to distinguish the energy source of mrk 273 and arp 220 .",
    "we argue that agn activity is the main energy source of mrk 273 , while the energy source of arp 220 is not clear . as a whole ,",
    "the suggestions in this paper are consistent with those by soifer et al .      in the @xmath152 @xmath0 m spectra of mrk 231 , iras 05189@xmath102524 , iras 23060 + 0505 , and iras 20460 + 1925 ,",
    "a broad ( @xmath112000 km s@xmath6 in full width at half - maximum ) component of neutral hydrogen recombination line emission was detected , and their intrinsic luminosities are high enough to account for the far - infrared luminosities resulting from agn activity alone ( veilleux , sanders , & kim 1999b ) .",
    "our suggestions about the energy source for these four irlgs are consistent with theirs .      among the nine irlgs ,",
    "five ( mrk 231 , iras 05189@xmath102524 , iras 08572 + 3915 , iras 23060 + 0505 , and iras 20460 + 1925 ) have warm ( _ iras _ 25 @xmath0 m to 60 @xmath0 m flux ratio @xmath46/@xmath47 @xmath11 0.2 ) far - infrared color ( table 1 ) .",
    "the above three infrared diagnoses have provided a growing amount of evidence that these warm irlgs are powered predominantly by agn activity ( table 5 ) . however , warm irlgs constitute only @xmath320% of total irlgs , and most irlgs have cool ( @xmath46/@xmath47 @xmath15 0.2 ) far - infrared color ( kim & sanders 1998 ) . it was argued based on the estimate of the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah strengths in the _ iso _ spectra that these cool irlgs are powered predominantly by starburst activity , with little agn contribution ( genzel & cesarsky 2000 ) . among the nine irlgs ,",
    "three ( arp 220 , ngc 6240 , and mrk 273 ) are cool irlgs and are classified as starburst - dominated irlgs based on the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah strength ( table 5 ) . however , for arp 220 and mrk 273 , our 34 @xmath0 m spectra suggest that the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah strengths , and thereby the magnitudes of starburst activity , may be overestimated based on the _ iso _ spectra . in fact , for mrk 273 , although the relative 7.7 @xmath0 m pah emission strength suggests this source is powered by starburst activity ( rigopoulou et al .",
    "1999 ) , a different diagnosis based on high excitation lines in the _ iso _ spectra indicates that agn activity is a dominant energy source ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) . for ngc 6240",
    ", x - ray data suggest that highly embedded and highly luminous agn activity is an important energy source ( vignati et al .",
    "the contribution of agn activity in the cool irlgs may be higher than the estimate based on the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah emission strength in the _ iso _ spectra .",
    "high spatial resolution radio images have been used to investigate the relative importance between agn and starburst activity in irlgs . a compact radio core , which was thought to be strong evidence for agn activity , is no longer definitive evidence for agn activity because both agn and compact starburst activity could explain observed properties of the compact radio core ( smith , lonsdale , & lonsdale 1998 ) .",
    "however , irlgs whose radio emission morphology is extended without a compact core are thought to be powered by starburst activity .",
    "compact radio cores were detected in ic 694 , arp 220 , ngc 6240 , mrk 273 , mrk 231 , and iras 20460 + 1925 ( lonsdale , lonsdale , & smith 1992 ; lonsdale , smith , & lonsdale 1993 ; heisler et al .",

    "1993 ; heisler et al .",
    "it is puzzling that no radio core emission was detected in the three warm irlgs , for which more than one infrared diagnoses consistently suggest that agn activity is a dominant energy source ( table 5 ) .      a high fraction ( 6/9 ) of irlgs in this sample",
    "are suggested to be powered by agn activity .",
    "this is thought to be caused by the selection effect of picking irlgs that are bright at 34 @xmath0 m . at a given far - infrared flux , the 34 @xmath0 m flux of less obscured",
    "agns is generally higher than that of starburst - dominated galaxies ( schmitt et al .",

    "these fractions are significantly higher than those in a larger sample of irlgs ( @xmath320% ; veilleux , kim , & sanders 1999a ; veilleux et al .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of warm irlgs in this sample ( 5/9 ; 55% ) is much higher than that in a larger sample of irlgs ( @xmath320% ; kim & sanders 1998 ) .",
    "observations of a larger number of fainter irlgs at @xmath14 are clearly necessary to evaluate the relative role between agn and starburst activity in irlgs as a whole .",
    "the energy sources of nine irlgs were diagnosed using the ew@xmath29 values and the @xmath1/@xmath2 ratios .",
    "the following main results were found :    1 .   mrk 231 , mrk 273 , and iras 05189@xmath102524 show detectable 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission in their 34 @xmath0 m spectra . however , the pah emission strengths are too small to account for the bulk of their far - infrared luminosities by starburst activity , indicating that these sources are powered by agn activity .",
    "no pah emission was detected in the spectra of iras 08572 + 3915 , iras 23060 + 0505 , and iras 20460 + 1925 .",
    "it was suggested that iras 08572 + 3915 is powered by highly obscured agn activity , while iras 23060 + 0505 and iras 20460 + 1925 are powered by less - obscured agn activity .",

    "agn activity contributes significantly is not clear because actual dust extinction correction factor could be higher than our estimate and the scatter of the intrinsic @xmath1/@xmath2 ratios for starburst activity is poorly known .",
