    "one of the remarkable byproducts of the development of quantum mechanics in recent years is quantum information and quantum computation theories .",

    "some of these differences are superposition principle , uncertainty principle and non - local effects .",
    "the non - locality associated with entanglement in quantum mechanics is one of the most subtle and intriguing phenomena in nature @xcite .",
    "its potential usefulness has been demonstrated in a variety of applications , such as quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography , and quantum dense coding . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum entanglement is a fragile feature , which can be destroyed by interaction with the environment .",
    "this effect , which is due to decoherence @xcite , is the main obstacle for practical implementation of quantum computing and quantum communication .",
    "several strategies have been devised against decoherence .",
    "quantum error correction codes , fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite and dechorence free subspaces @xcite are among them .",
    "one of the main problems in the quantum communication is the decoherence effects in the quantum channels .",
    "recently , the study of quantum channels has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "early works in this direction were devoted , mainly , to memoryless channels for which consecutive signal transmissions through the channel are not correlated .",
    "the capacities of some of these channels were determined @xcite and it was proven that in most cases their capacities are additive for single uses of the channel . for gaussian channels under gaussian inputs , the multiplicativity of output purities was proven in @xcite and the additivity of the energy - constrained capacity , even in the presence of classical noise and thermal noise , was proven in @xcite , under the assumption that successive uses of the channel are represented by the tensor product of the operators representing one single use of the channel , i.e. , the channel is memoryless .    in a recent letter , bartlett _",
    "@xcite showed that it is possible to communicate with perfect fidelity , and without a shared reference frame , at a rate that asymptotically approaches one encoded qubit per transmitted qubit .",
    "they proposed a method to encode a qubit , using photons in a decoherence - free subspace of the collective noise model .",
    "considered collective - noise channel effects in the quantum key distribution @xcite and they gave a realistic roboust scheme for quantum communication , with polarized entangled photon pairs @xcite . in the last few years",
    "much attention has been given to bosonic quantum channels @xcite .",
    "recently macchiavello _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , considered a different class of channels , in which correlated noise acts on consecutive uses of channels .",
    "they showed that higher mutual information can be achieved above a certain memory threshold , by entangling two consecutive uses of the channel .",
    "this type of channels and its extension to the bosonic case , has attracted a lot of attention in the recent years @xcite .",

    "_ suggestion experimentally .",
    "they shown how entanglement can be used to enhance classical communication over a noisy channel . in their setting ,",
    "the introduction of entanglement between two photons is required in order to maximize the amount of information that can be encoded in their joint polarization degree of freedom , and they obtained experimental classical capacity with entangled states and showed that it is more than @xmath0 times the theoretical upper limit , when no quantum correlations are allowed . hence , recently some people show that provided the sender and receiver share prior entanglement , a higher amount of classical information is transmitted over pauli channels in the presence of memory , as compared to product and entangled state coding @xcite .    in this paper , we show that if parties use a semi - quantum approach to entanglement - assisted coding , a higher amount of classical information is transmitted .",
    "we derive a general expression for the entanglement - assisted classical capacity and compare our results with the product bell states and entanglement - assisted coding for various types of pauli channels .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review some properties of quantum memory channels and derive the general expression of classical capacity of quantum channel for product and maximally entangled state coding . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the general expression of entanglement - assisted classical capacity of quantum channels with correlated noise that was calculated previously for pauli channels by arshed and toor ( at ) . in sec iv , we show that at model is not an optimal coding for transmission of classical information , and we suggest another sets of states and derive the general expression of entanglement - assisted classical capacity .",
    "our results show that a higher amount of classical capacity can indeed be achieved for all values of memory , by two or four consecutive uses of the entanglement - assisted systems for depolarizing , flip , two pauli and phase damping channels .",
    "encoding classical information into quantum states of physical systems gives a physical implementation of the constructs of information theory .",
    "the majority of research into quantum communication channels has focused on the memoryless case , although there have been a number of important results obtained for quantum channels with correlated noise operators or more general quantum channels @xcite .",
    "the action of transmission channels is described by kraus operators @xmath1 @xcite , which satisfy the @xmath2 , the equality holds when the map is trace - preserving .",
    "thus , if we send a qubit in a state described by the density operator @xmath3 , through the channel , then the corresponding out put state is given by the map .",
    "@xmath4    an interesting class of kraus operators acting on individual qubits can be expressed in terms of the pauli operators @xmath5 @xmath6 with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "a noise model for these actions is , for instance , the application of a random rotation by angle @xmath10 around the axis @xmath11 with the probabilities @xmath12 respectively , and the identity with probability @xmath13 .    in the simplest scenario",
    ", the transmitter can send one qubit at a time along the channel . in this case",
    "the codewords will be restricted to the tensor products of the states of the individual qubits .",
    "quantum mechanics , however allows also the possibility to entangle multiple uses of the channel .",
    "recently , a model for quantum channels with memory has been proposed that can consistently define quantum channels with markovian correlated noise @xcite .",
    "the model is also extended to describe channels that act on transmitted states in such a way that there is no requirement for interactions with an environment within the model .",
    "a markovian correlated noise channel of length @xmath14 , is of the form :    @xmath15    where the @xmath16 are kraus operators for single uses of the channel on the state @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be interpreted as the conditional probability that a @xmath10 rotation around the axis @xmath19 is applied to the @xmath17-th qubit , given that a @xmath10 rotation around axis @xmath20 was applied on the @xmath21-th qubit .",
    "they considered @xcite the case of two consecutive uses of a channel with a partial memory , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "this means that with the probability @xmath23 , the same rotation is applied to both qubits , while with probability @xmath24 the two rotations are uncorrelated .",
    "then , they concentrated their attention on the depolarizing channel , for which @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and showed that for the specific case of a quantum depolarizing channel with collective noise , the transmission of classical information can be enhanced by employing maximally entangled states as carriers of information , rather than product states .    in this section , we would like derive a general expression for the classical capacity of pauli quantum channels with correlated noise for bell and product states .",
    "the maximum mutual information @xmath27 of a general quantum channel @xmath28 is given by the holevo - schumacher - westmoreland bound @xcite @xmath29 } s(\\varepsilon ( \\sum_{i } \\pi_{i}\\rho_{i } ) ) -\\sum_{i}\\pi_{i}s(\\varepsilon(\\rho_{i}))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the von neumann entropy of the density operator @xmath31 and the maximization is performed over all input ensembles @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "the second term on the right hand side of equation ( [ sch ] ) becomes : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are eigenvalues of the transformed states . on the other hand , with respect to the relation @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , we show that the holevo limit can be attained by setting @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 ) .",
    "the quantum state @xmath43 , in the first term , can be writhen as :    @xmath44    to get the final result , we take suitable bases for the density matrixes representation .",
    "then , the mutual information @xmath27 of quantum channel is given by :    @xmath45    which for bell states have the eigenvalues : @xmath46    with a similar approach , it is straightforward to verify that eigenvalues of product states in the @xmath47 basis @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 ) are give by :    @xmath50    by inserting these eigenvalues in the eq .",

    "alice sends her qubits through the channel .",
    "they calculated eigenvalues of the pure density matrix , transformed under the action of the depolarizing channel , for probabilities @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and after some simple calculations , they derived the entanglement - assisted classical capacity for the pauli channels in the presence of partial memory .    as was suggested by at , in the presence of partial memory ,",

    "our results show that for channels with partial memory and with the use of appropriate choice of entanglement - assisted states , higher mutual information can indeed be achieved for all values of @xmath70 , by two or four consecutive uses of the channel .",

    "this protocol ( using one shared bell state between parties and two types of qubits transmission ) , we call semi - quantum dense coding which has the same cost as that of the at approach ( which uses two shared bell states between parties and one type of qubits transmission in the quantum channel ) .    we consider the shortest variational time of the channel ( fiber ) under thermal and mechanical fluctuations as @xmath88 .",

    "fig.([phase ] ) shows that for phase damping channels , the use of two particles semi - quantum dense coding is more appropriate , compared with the four particle approach to information transmission , for all of values of @xmath70 .",
    "this shows that in the usual stage ( previously unshared state ) @xcite , the use of product states in the @xmath47 basis would be more efficient than in the @xmath51 or @xmath57 basis .    on the other hand , we show that @xmath189 is superadditive in the presence of entanglement - assisted , i.e. we have @xmath190 and therefore @xmath191 . at this stage ,",
    "the classical capacity @xmath192 of the channel is defined by : @xmath193 it has been shown ( similar to what we plotted in the figures ) that the amount of reliable information which can be transmitted per use of the channel , is given by @xcite : @xmath194    one of the main applications of the above extension of memorial channels is the extension of the standard quantum cryptography bb84 @xcite to protocols where the key is carried by quantum states in a space of higher dimension , using two ( or @xmath195 ) mutually unbiased bases , which for high memorial channels have very low error rates .",
    "this procedure ensures that any attempt by any eavesdropper eve to gain information on sender s state induces errors in the transmission , which can be detected by the legitimate parties @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if we are interested in other quantum key distribution protocols ( such as the epr protocol @xcite ) , we must encode a qubit in a decoherence - free subspace of the collective noise for key distribution @xcite .",
    "if we are interested in the total dimension of hilbert space , we must revise the epr protocol for this new approach .",
    "another application of the above extension can be quantum coding and quantum superdence coding at higher dimensions .",
    "the errors in the memorial channels can be considered as a subset of collective noise which are considered in the decoherence - free subspace approach .",
    "some experimental results @xcite show that in some special cases the use of these states are appropriate , because in the memorial channels we make use of all maximally entangled states .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated a general expression for the classical capacity of a quantum channel for product states , maximally entangled states and entanglement - assisted coding in the presence of memory .",
    "hence , we have suggested another approach for the transmission of information by using semi - quantum dense coding . in this approach",
    ", we use an entangled pair that was previously shared between the parties , and they compromised for a transmission of quantum states through quantum channels in a specific manner .",
    "our results show that if noise in the consecutive uses of the channels is assumed to be markov - correlated quantum noise , then , the use of semi - quantum approach to quantum dense coding enhances classical capacity of quantum channels in various types of pauli channels .",
