    "cosmology is assumed to convert the measured redshifts into comoving distances .",
    "this is because the clustering measured along the line - of - sight has a dependence on cosmology that differs from that of the clustering measurements in the angular direction .",
    "the goal of this work is to use dynamical and geometric distortions to study the large scale coherent infall and put constraints on cosmology , from a sample of @xmath16 lyman - break galaxies .",
    "the infall can be quantified by measuring @xmath17 , defined as @xmath18 ( @xmath19 being the linear bias parameter ) .",
    "the relation between the clustering measured in real- and @xmath1-space , in one dimension , in the linear regime , was derived by @xcite .",
    "he found that the large - scale infall will simply produce an amplitude shift of the correlation function , measured in real- and @xmath1-space .",
    "the use of geometric distortions to study cosmology was pioneered by @xcite , who demonstrated that they can be used as a powerful cosmological test for a non - zero @xmath20 .",

    "the systemic redshifts of the lbgs can be determined as follows :    if no absorption features are easily identified and the redshift is determined from the lyman-@xmath29 line only , then the following correction is applied :    z_lbg = z_ly- , [ equation : zem ] where @xmath35 is the `` corrected '' redshift of the galaxy , @xmath36 the redshift measured from fitting a gaussian to the lyman-@xmath29 line s profile , @xmath37 the mean velocity of the lyman-@xmath29 relative to the galaxy s nebular lines and @xmath38 is the speed of light .",

    "therefore , we generated a random set of points in each the fields of the survey .",
    "we generated 20 randoms for each lbg in each field .",

    "the distribution of the number of lbgs as a function of angular distance to the centre of the field ( or , in some cases , the position of the background qso ) is consistent with the non - existence of radial gradients .",
    "it is possible that normalizing the random distribution to the number density of galaxies in each field causes some clustering features to be `` washed out '' . if one or more specific fields lie directly in regions with particularly high ( or low ) clustering signal , then by generating random sets independently of the space density in other fields will cause this structure to become unnoticeable . in order to understand",

    "the random peculiar motions of the qsos will cause an elongation of the clustering signal along the @xmath62 direction .",
    "the predominant effect at large scales is the coherent infall of the lbgs into the potential well of overdense regions , which causes a flattening of the @xmath63 contours along the @xmath62 direction and some elongation along @xmath61",
    ".    geometric distortions also occur if the cosmology assumed to convert the observed qso redshifts into distances is not the same as the true , underlying cosmology of the universe .",
    "the reason is because the cosmology dependence of the separations along the redshift direction is not the same as the one of the separations measured in the perpendicular direction @xcite .",

    "the effects of the velocity error of @xmath64 quoted by @xcite are therefore not evident in this plot , possibly due to the cancelling of `` finger - of - god '' effects and infall , but more probably due to the effects of noise .",
    "the @xmath1-space correlation function consists of a `` distorted '' measurement of the clustering properties of the lbgs .",
    "our goal in this _ paper _ is to use these distortions to derive constraints on @xmath65 and @xmath66 and draw conclusions on the bias and infall of the galaxies at an early stage in the history of the universe , as well as discuss the improvement that can be achieved with larger , future lbg surveys .",

    "the best fitting values are @xmath14 and @xmath15 . fig .",
    "[ fig : xisp_data_model ] shows the @xmath3 data ( dashed line ) and the best fitting @xmath3 model ( solid line ) , obtained from the joint constraints on @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "a visual comparison between the solid and the dashed contours also shows that the model is a good description of the @xmath3 data .",
    "here we have used the @xmath1-space distortions on the clustering pattern of a sample of lbgs to derive constraints on @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the method used requires the spherical average amplitude of the correlation function to be accurately known and given as an input to the model . due to the small size of the fields used in the survey ,",
    "the clustering measured across the line - of - sight is not probed at scales larger than @xmath126 .",
    "for this reason , and given that at @xmath127 only the smallest scales are significantly affected by non - linear distortions caused by the random motions of the galaxies , the input amplitude of the spherically averaged correlation function should be obtained from @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath8 shape suggests that the real - space correlation function of the lbgs might deviate significantly from a simple power - law model , and these deviations are not evident in the projection @xmath4 .",
    "future lbg surveys where larger scales across the line - of - sight are probed , will allow a coherent picture of the clustering to be drawn from the @xmath4 and @xmath8 measurements , similarly to what has been done for the 2df qso redshift survey @xcite .",
    "once a suitable model for describing the amplitude of the correlation function as a function of scale is obtained ( a two power - law model was found to be a good description in the present case ) , then the @xmath1-space and geometric distortions can be modeled and constraints on @xmath65 and @xmath66 drawn .",
    "the combination of these constraints with orthogonal confidence levels from linear growth of density perturbations , indicates that @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these values are consistent with previous measurements of the bias .",
    "@xcite found , for a @xmath20cdm cosmology , @xmath128 , using a sample of lbgs from the canada - france deep field survey .",
    "considering the wmap results @xcite , if we take @xmath129 , which is within our computed error bars , their obtained value of @xmath19 corresponds to @xmath130 , which is well within our derived error bars and hence consistent with our results .",
    "however , results from our @xmath3 fits strongly relies on the amplitude and shape of the input correlation function .",
    "if our input @xmath8 shape is uncertain , then this may introduce errors in the measured constraints of @xmath66 and @xmath65 .",
    "we found that the derived constraints are very robust to @xmath51 changes in the parameters describing the double power - law @xmath8 model .",
    "however , changes to the assumed @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) shape , will lead to more significant changes in the derived @xmath66 and @xmath65 constraints .",
    "unfortunately , with the present data it is difficult to measure the real - space correlation function .",
    "this handicap is basically due to two factors : the size of fields used ; and the number of lbgs in the survey .",
    "even though the latter is , in part , balanced by the high space density of these galaxies , the former prevents any real - space clustering measurement at scales @xmath131 , except via the @xmath8 form .",
    "this hampers any attempt to build such a coherent picture of lbg clustering .",
    "we believe we have done the best that is possible with the current data .",
    "it is important to stress the advantage of the lbgs high spatial density for @xmath1-space distortion analyses .",
    "the constraints in @xmath66 and @xmath81 from the @xmath3 fitting alone are comparable to those achieved with the 2qz sample @xcite , which includes @xmath132 qsos . however , the much smaller number of objects , in the present work , is counterbalanced by their high - spatial density , which dramatically increases the clustering signal .",
    "our results not only reflect what can be achieved in cosmological and dynamical constraints from @xmath1-space distortions , but they also foreshadow future work , based on larger lbg surveys .",
