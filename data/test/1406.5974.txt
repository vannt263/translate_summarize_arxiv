    "the prospect of tremendous speedup over classical computation has channeled considerable research effort into the pursuit of building a universal quantum computer @xcite . however , one of the most significant challenges has been error correction : despite numerous attempts to physically realize and control quantum bits , all share a striking sensitivity to decoherence  external disturbance attributed to the unavoidable interaction with the environment . and while correcting these errors is in principle possible @xcite , achieving error resilience in an efficient and , in particular , scalable way is challenging and consequently a topic of considerable research interest .",
    "traditionally , quantum information processing is conceptualized as a quantum adaptation of the binary storage system found in current computers .",
    "however , there are several indicators that `` thinking outside the binary box '' might be a key ingredient to further progress towards reliable quantum computation .",
    "recent results suggest hat @xmath0-level quantum systems , so called `` qudits , '' are potentially more powerful than their binary counterparts in terms of information processing @xcite . furthermore , while single - qubit gates can typically be implemented with relatively high fidelity , two - qubit gates are often more challenging because they require concurrent control over several parts of the system .",
    "higher - dimensional quantum systems can allow for information - coding with increased density , thus potentially reducing the number of error - prone inter - qudit interactions required to perform specific computations @xcite .",
    "different working quantum computing devices are currently being scrutinized by a myriad of research teams around the globe : these range from commercial quantum annealing devices , such as d - wave inc.s d - wave two quantum annealer @xcite based on superconducting flux qubits , to proof - of - principle trapped - ion qubits that recently demonstrated successfully fault - tolerant quantum computation based on topological protection @xcite .",
    "while the former is built for scalability , it suffers from decoherence effects mostly due to @xmath1 noise .",
    "the latter , on the other hand , is robust against noise due to the inherent topological protection , however shows little prospect of scalability .",
    "several of the current approaches to physically represent quantum information can be extended to more than two levels , including optical system @xcite , superconductors and flux qubits @xcite , as well as atomic spins @xcite .",
    "given the theoretical promise that qudit - based systems have shown @xcite , it is thus of paramount interest to quantify their resilience to noise .    in terms of achieving error resilience for a given set of building blocks , topological error - correction codes are currently among the best candidates for a scalable error - correction scheme @xcite .",
    "this approach of using topology to reliably encode quantum information can also be extended to multi - level qudit systems , resulting in the so - called abelian quantum double models @xcite .",
    "we are interested in estimating the dependence of the error threshold on the qudit dimensionality  that is , the maximum amount of errors a system of @xmath0-level qudits can sustain while still being able to reliably store the encoded information . in the spirit of the approach used to estimate the error tolerance of fault - tolerant systems pioneered in refs .",
    "@xcite for qubit systems , we present a mapping of this statistical analysis to classical potts - spin models that can be seen as the natural extension of boolean variables to @xmath0 states .",
    "this allows us to numerically calculate the bit - flip error threshold for qudit - based quantum memories using monte carlo simulations , a key figure of merit .",

    "let us use @xmath3 to denote the computational basis of the spins .",
    "we will use these to define a qudit generalization of the toric code based on the cyclic group @xmath4 , which we call the @xmath5 code @xcite .    like the qubit - based toric code",
    ", operators are defined on the spins around each plaquette and vertex of a square lattice in order to define occupancies of anyonic quasiparticles . for the plaquettes ,",
    "these operators depend on relations between the states of the spins around the plaquette when expressed in the computational basis . in the case",
    "that all the spins @xmath6 around a plaquette @xmath7 are in definite computational basis states @xmath8 , the plaquette is said to hold an anyon of type @xmath9 , where @xmath10 the numbering of the spins in eq .   around the plaquette",

    "the @xmath11 anyon is identified with the vacuum , while the @xmath12 other anyon types are non - trivial .",

    "all are non - trivial except @xmath18 , which yields the identity .    for the vertices of the code anyon occupancies",
    "are defined in a similar manner as for the plaquettes .",
    "the basis used is not the computational basis , but that defined by @xmath19 there are also corresponding operations @xmath20 that manipulate these anyons .",
    "these vertex anyons are completely dual to the plaquette ones , and so can be treated independently and analogously .",
    "we therefore restrict our attention to plaquette anyons without loss of generality .",
    "quantum information is stored in the vacuum states of the anyons , i.e. , states where no anyons are present on any plaquette or vertex .",
    "there are @xmath0 such states , allowing a logical qudit to be stored .",
    "the action of any errors on the code can be expressed in terms of the @xmath21 and @xmath20 operations , and so correspond to the creation and manipulation of anyons .",
    "the resulting anyon configuration , which serves as the syndrome of the code , then allows information about the errors to be determined .",
    "the goal of error correction is to use this information to remove the effects of the errors .",
    "error correction will not always succeed .",
    "the probability with which it fails depends on the linear system size of the code , @xmath22 , and the strength of the noise , @xmath23 . if @xmath23 is below a threshold value , which we denote @xmath24 for a @xmath5 code , the probability of failure decays exponentially with @xmath22 .",
    "success then become certain as @xmath25 . for @xmath26 , however , the probability of failure is always @xmath27 .    to determine the value of the error threshold @xmath24 for a @xmath28 code , we must consider a specific error model . here",

    "[ sec : results ] , the thresholds are determined numerically for several different values of @xmath0 .",
    "however it is interesting to consider how @xmath24 may behave for @xmath31 .    for the @xmath29 code",
    "it has been observed in multiple cases that the threshold follows the hashing bound @xcite .",
    "it has been speculated that this may also hold in the qudit case @xcite .",
    "for the error model we consider , the hashing bound probability @xmath32 is the solution to the equation @xmath33 note that although this is referred to as a `` bound , ''",
    "it serves as an _ upper _ bound only for non - degenerate codes . because the codes we consider are degenerate , they are not necessarily limited by these values .      even though the hashing bound is not a strict upper bound for the codes we consider ,",
    "such a bound can be derived .",
    "suppose all spins of a @xmath5 code are prepared in state @xmath34 .",
    "if the anyon configuration is then measured , it will be found that there is only vacuum on all plaquettes but a random pattern of anyons on the vertices . when the latter are removed , the resulting state of the code is that for which the logical qubit state is @xmath34 .",
    "now suppose that a unitary @xmath35 is applied to all spins prior to the measurement , such that @xmath36 this has the same effects on the measurement results as applying errors of the form @xmath37 for @xmath38 with equal probability @xmath30 , where @xmath39 .",
    "the threshold @xmath24 in the latter case therefore corresponds to a threshold angle @xmath40 in the former .",
    "for @xmath41 error correction will yield the code in logical state @xmath34 with certainty as @xmath42 .    a similar argument",
    "can be applied using the complementary basis in which the vertex anyon states are defined . if each qudit is prepared in state @xmath43 , syndrome measurement and error correction result in the logical qubit state @xmath43 .",
    "applying the unitary operator @xmath44 to each spin before measurement has the same effect as errors of the form @xmath45 for @xmath38 with equal probability @xmath30 where @xmath46 .",
    "there will then be a critical angle @xmath47 below which error correction yields the code in logical state @xmath43 with certainty as @xmath48 .",
    "note that , for particular values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 this corresponds to both of the above cases with the errors occurring with probability @xmath52 as such , error correction can not successfully correct both types of error , because it can not yield a code whose logical state is simultaneously @xmath34 and @xmath43 .",
    "this error rate must therefore be above the threshold , giving us an upper bound @xmath53 for the threshold error rate @xmath24 of the @xmath5 code .      for some values of @xmath0",
    "it is also possible to construct a lower bound : given an integer @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are co - prime , the fundamental theorem of abelian groups states that the group @xmath4 is isomorphic to @xmath57 . as such",
    ", the problem of decoding an error correcting code based on the @xmath28 quantum double model is the same as that for two separate codes , one based on @xmath58 and the other on @xmath59 .",
    "we may therefore consider the independent decoding of these two component codes , rather than decoding the full @xmath5 code .    by definition , the optimal decoding of the component codes can not do better than optimal decoding for the full @xmath5 code . in general",
    "it will do worse , because the error model for the full @xmath5 code will translate to one on the component codes with strong correlations between the two . ignoring these correlations by decoding the component codes independently leads to decreased performance .    for the @xmath5 code",
    "there are @xmath12 non - trivial errors of the form @xmath37 , corresponding to @xmath60 .",
    "the number of these that act non - trivially on the @xmath61 code is @xmath62 : the number of elements of @xmath57 that do not correspond to the identity for @xmath61 .",
    "these all occur with equal probability @xmath30 . using @xmath63 to denote the total probability of error for the @xmath61 code",
    ", it follows @xmath64 when decoding the component codes independently , error correction fails when either of the component codes experience an error rate above their threshold .",
    "the error rate @xmath23 at which this occurs is then a lower bound for @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath65 we can also use this as a self - consistency check for any proposed set of thresholds @xmath66 , such as those provided by the hashing bound , eq .  .",
    "the easiest way to do this is to use prime @xmath55 , ensuring that @xmath67 is co - prime .",
    "self - consistency then requires @xmath68 which is indeed satisfied by the hashing bound values .",
    "we first map the problem of computing the error threshold to a classical statistical - mechanical model with disorder .",
    "the threshold where errors in the quantum setup can not be corrected any longer will correspond to the loss of a symmetry broken phase in the classical model .",
    "for the mapping we consider a square lattice and an initially anyon - free state , @xmath69 .",
    "errors @xmath70 are applied independently to each quantum spin , where @xmath71 denotes the type of error applied to the spin on edge @xmath2 .",
    "we initially perform the mapping with a general error model where each value occurs with respective probability @xmath72 and the error is non - trivial with total probability @xmath73 .",

    "this ratio can be interpreted as a boltzmann weight for a classical model with the hamiltonian @xmath93 we interpret the @xmath94 as the state of the system and @xmath95 as representing the details of the ( quenched ) interactions . because the partition function sums only over the former , the second term in the brackets of eq .",
    "is an overall constant and hence can be ignored .    to ensure that @xmath79 and @xmath84 belong to the same error class",
    ", we require that a system state @xmath94 satisfies the constraint in eq .  .",
    "this is achieved by introducing an auxiliary @xmath0-level classical spin @xmath96 on each vertex @xmath97 of the lattice .",

    "[ fig : numbers](b ) .",
    "all the @xmath99 around a plaquette @xmath7 will then appear exactly twice in @xmath100 ( and with opposite sign ) , thus leaving the required value of zero in all cases .    in summary",
    ", we can sample from the set of errors @xmath84 with the same anyon configuration as a set @xmath79 ( i.e. , from the _ error class _ of @xmath79 ) by sampling from a classical two - dimensional statistical - mechanical spin model defined on a square lattice with @xmath101 sites and @xmath0-level spins on the vertices .",
    "the classical spin model of interest has the hamiltonian @xmath102 where the errors of @xmath103 are generated according to the error model .",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath76 and the interaction constants @xmath77 need to be scaled accordingly to satisfy eq .  .    for the purpose of our numerical simulations",
    ", we consider the special case where all non - trivial errors have equal probability : @xmath104 . in this case",
    "the simplest way to satisfy eq .   is to sample at inverse temperature @xmath105 this is the generalization of the nishimori condition  @xcite , which , for the symmetrical case , ensures that the boltzmann weight of each state corresponds to the a priori probability of the quantum error configuration it represents .",

    "each quantum error is translated to a non - trivial interaction constant @xmath71 and the difference , @xmath86 , is associated with the surface of a flipped domain of potts spins .",
    "therefore , if in our sampling we find the system in an overall ordered state , there is little uncertainty in the type of error that occurred .",
