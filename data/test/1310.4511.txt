    "strongly non - reciprocal structures and one - way propagation schemes have attracted considerable attention in the last decade .",
    "numerous different configurations were suggested to create one - way structures , most of them share a common concept .",
    "first , one violates lorentz s reciprocity , either by making the susceptibility @xmath4 asymmetric using magnetization or by time modulation of @xmath4 .",
    "hence propagation in opposing directions possesses different sets of features .",
    "then , another mechanism ( e.g.  geometric ) is employed to make one set preferable , yielding one - way behavior . one way total reflection from infinite periodic magneto - optical ( mo ) layers were demonstrated in @xcite . in other configurations , one - way behavior exists at the interface between two photonic crystals ( phc ) , or between a phc and a metal , where at least one of them consists of mo or gyro - magnetic material @xcite .",
    "photonic topological insulators based on edge - states between two bianisotropic metamaterials were suggested in @xcite . in all these schemes the one - way edge - states",
    "are assumed to be completely separated from the surrounding free - space by the semi - infinite _ supposedly impenetrable _ structures on both sides .",
    "one - way transmission through a screen - assembly composed of perforated perferct electric conductor ( pec ) placed at the interface of a mo media is shown in @xcite . likewise , one - way transmission through combined screens of mo material and @xmath5-near zero ( enz ) material @xcite , through combined screens of mo and negative-@xmath5 materials @xcite , or through a screen of magnetized enz in voigt configuration @xcite , were suggested .",
    "non - magnetic one - way behavior was achieved by time - modulation of @xmath5 @xcite . in all the schemes",
    "above , the transverse dimensions of the one - way structure must be of several wavelengths ( or several phc periods ) to operate properly .",
    "one - way guiding structures consisting of a single linear chain of nano - scale plasmonic particles were suggested in @xcite .",
    "these studies include analytical models based on the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) , and full - wave simulations with material loss and finite particle size verifying the one - way property for realistic parameters .",
    "the underlying physics is based on the interplay of two types of rotations : geometric and electromagnetic .",
    "an examples is shown in fig .",
    "a chain of plasmonic particles supporting trapped plasmonic modes is exposed to transverse magnetization @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 induces _ longitudinal rotation _ of the chain modes : the excited dipole in each particle rotates in the @xmath8 plane .",
    "longitudinal chirality _ is introduced by using non - spherical particles that rotate in the @xmath8 plane , with rotation step @xmath9 , as shown in the figure .",
    "two - type rotations coexist in a single plane , and their interplay enhances non - reciprocity and creates one - way guiding @xcite .",
    "this structure has several appealing properties .",
    "( a ) it possesses nano - scale transverse size .",
    "( b ) propagation in the  forbidden \" direction decays by two orders of magnitude over distances of @xmath10 .",
    "( c ) @xmath11 is weaker than other magnetization - based approaches .",
    "( d ) since both rotations take place in a single plane that coincides with the chain axis , particle dimension in the @xmath12 direction is unimportant ; one may use flat ellipsoidal flakes as particles .",
    "hence , the structure is _ flat _ , amenable for planar fabrication .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to generalize the one - dimensional concept of broken time - reversal symmetry , by suggesting the _ meta - weaves_. being a nano - scale wide , flat , one - way `` thread , '' the longitudinal - chirality chain in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a may be used to `` weave '' meta - surfaces that _ add dimensions _ to the _ concept _ of broken time reversal symmetry . in these structures the natural association of the 1d mapping @xmath2 with the 1d mapping @xmath3",
    "_ can not be made_. rather , the former needs to be associated with a higher dimensional mapping in the plane . to characterize this association and the ensuing optical behavior",
    "we define the notion of _ sector - way _ propagation ; a structure is said to be @xmath13 sector - way if , when excited by a point source , it allows propagation only into a cone whose vertex angle is @xmath13 .",
    "our meta - weaves possess _ sector - way _ propagation dynamics and offer new possibilities for controlling the flow of light in a plain .",
    "there are many ways to weave a surface .",
    "some examples are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1](b)-(d ) .",
    "the most natural choice is the `` snug '' weave , defined as the case where the weave period ( = inter - thread distance ) matches the chain period .",
    "the `` tight '' weave is defined as the case when the inter - chain distance is the same as the inter - particle distance within the corresponding single chain .",
    "the weave periods in the @xmath14 directions @xmath15 for the snug and tight weaves coincide with the corresponding chains period .    due to inter - threads coupling , the meta - weave properties",
    "may not always be inferred by a mere `` product '' of the single threads . nevertheless , sector - way propagation is observed even in tight weaves , reflecting the robust nature of the two - type rotation principle and its compatibility for multi - dimensional nonreciprocity .",
    "our weaves are systematically structured as follows .",
    "all particles possess the same shape , differing only by rotation .",
    "the @xmath16 _ lattice _",
    "location @xmath17 and rotation @xmath18 , are given by @xmath19 here @xmath20 are the fundamental lattice vectors along which the chains are weaved , and @xmath21 are the corresponding rotation steps . in tight",
    "weaves all lattice points are occupied by a particle , but every non - tight weave possesses empty points .",
    "we denote by @xmath22 the set of all occupied points .",
    "we use the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) to study our meta - weaves . under the dda",
    ", a particle response to an exciting local field @xmath23 ( the field at the particle s location , in the absence of the particle ) , is described by its dipole moment @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the particle polarizability matrix .",
    "it formally holds when the particle size @xmath26 is much smaller than @xmath27 and when the inter - particle distance @xmath28 .",
    "however , studies show excellent agreement with exact solutions even when @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "also , full wave simulations with finite particle size and material loss show that the one - way chains dynamics is predicted well by the dda @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath7 affects only the @xmath30 entries of @xmath25 .",
    "hence the @xmath31 components of @xmath25 can be ignored , rendering @xmath25 a @xmath32 matrix , and @xmath33 a two - elements vector . in our weaves , the @xmath16 particle polarizability @xmath34 is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a rotation by @xmath37 operator in the @xmath8 plane , and @xmath25 is the polarizability of a reference ellipsoidal particle . a drude - model @xmath25 of a magnetized ellipsoid that takes into account the particle s radiation loss is used here ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we assume lossless material . it has been shown that material loss doesnot change essentially the one - way thread properties if one uses much denser chains , but in this case valid",
    "modeling requires full - wave simulations @xcite . for our structures",
    "this is beyond currently available computing power . with the definitions above , the surface modes are governed by the difference equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) denotes the integers pair @xmath16 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "@xmath42 is the dyadic green s function @xcite , hence @xmath43 gives the electric field at @xmath44 due to a dipole @xmath33 at @xmath45 .",
    "the set @xmath46 is the set @xmath22 excluding the point @xmath39 .",
    "the eigensolutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) constitute the surface modes ( i.e. in - plane propagation ) .",
    "it can be reduced to a finite matrix by exploiting the weave periodicity .",
    "we find that using the rectangular periodicity is the most convenient approach even for hexagonal weaves , mainly because symmetry - based @xmath47-space reductions ( e.g. irreducible brillouin zone ) can not be applied due to loss of reciprocity .",
    "furthermore , the rectangular representation is sometimes more efficient even in hexagonal weaves .",
    "for example , the parallelogram period of the lattice in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d obtained from the hexagonal lattice vectors consists of 36 particles , while the rectangular periodicity cell consists of only 12 particles .",
    "hence , we define @xmath48 as the restriction of @xmath22 to a reference rectangular period containing the origin . @xmath48 consists of @xmath49 particle locations @xmath50 , with the corresponding @xmath49 polarizabilities @xmath51 [ eq .  ( [ eq3 ] )",
    "consists of at most @xmath49 different @xmath34 s ] .",
    "each point @xmath52 can be expressed by the three integers @xmath53 where @xmath54 counts the points in @xmath48 , and @xmath55 count the unit cells . by periodicity ,",
    "the dipole response in each particle @xmath56 satisfies @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the wave - vector , and @xmath59 . using the above in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , we obtain a matrix equation with @xmath60 blocks of @xmath32 submatrices , governing the @xmath49 vectors @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the @xmath64 matrices @xmath65 and where the @xmath55 summation is over all integers .",
    "the prime indicates that the summation excludes the singular self - term arising in @xmath66 when @xmath67 .",
    "this summation converges poorly , but it can be accelerated using the ewald method @xcite , modified to account the self term exclusion @xcite . the dispersion @xmath68 is obtained numerically by nullifying the corresponding determinant . since our meta - weaves are _ non - bravais _ lattices there are @xmath49 dispersion surfaces for each of the particle s resonances , that need to be searched .",
    "we turn now to some examples , starting with the snug rectangular weave of fig .",
    "the parameters are @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the particle s axis ratios are @xmath71 , where @xmath72 . with these parameters",
    "the dda is highly accurate . for cu ( @xmath73 nm )",
    "particles diameter is @xmath74 nm and @xmath75 nm ( for larger cu particles see last example ) .",
    "also @xmath76 , and @xmath77 denotes magnetization strength ( cyclotron frequency ) .",
    "the particle possesses two resonances ( associated with @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) , and there are @xmath80 particles in a period .",
    "hence we have @xmath81 dispersion surfaces , only some of which support sector - way guiding .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that symmetry under the operation @xmath82 is broken when rotation and magnetization are simultaneously introduced .",
    "this strong asymmetry leads to `` sector - way '' guiding , explained as follows .",
    "there is a well - established theory of these one - way threads @xcite , showing that the excitation magnitude of a thread mode near the light - cone scales as @xmath83 hence , modes touching or residing very close to the light cone are practically non - excitable .",
    "[ fig2]d shows that the dispersion contours within the blue to green range , touch or nearly touch the light - cone in the third quadrant ; the normalized distance @xmath84 .",
    "hence eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) predicts a reduction of more than two orders of magnitude in the corresponding modes excitation .",
    "therefor propagation in these directions ( given by the dispersion s local gradient ) is practically blocked .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the response of this weave to an excitation of a unit dipole at its center .",
    "a @xmath85 and a @xmath86 sector way propagations are seen .",
    "the latter picture exhibits much stronger oscillations than the former .",
    "this is because in the @xmath85 sector , most of the reflections occurring at the surface edge are in `` forbidden '' directions , hence they decay exponentially as they leak energy to the free space . in the @xmath86 sector - way case",
    "some reflections occur at allowed directions and interfere with the modes propagating towards the edge .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows another surface of the same weave , and a response to a dipole excitation at three different frequencies .",
    "@xmath85 sector - way ,",
    "@xmath86 sector - way , and all - way are observed . the sector - way shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b is _ not _ obtained by an obvious `` cartezian product '' of the individual threads .",
    "such a product would predict a sector that coincides with one of the plane quadrants , while the sector obtained is centered approximately around @xmath87 .",
    "the high intensity saturated field in fg .",
    "[ fig4]c is due to the fact that reflections at edges are all into allowed directions , hence they fill the surface and increase the intensity .",
    "now to the tight weaves .",
    "figures [ fig5]a , b show the dispersion and the response of the tight rectangular weave of fig .",
    "[ fig1]c with the same parameters as above .",
    "figures [ fig5]c , d show the dispersion and the response of the tight hexagonal weave of fig .",
    "[ fig1]d with inter - particle distance @xmath88 , with @xmath71 where @xmath89 , and with the same magnetization as above .",
    "sector - way propagation is observed in both weaves .        as a last example , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the response of the snug rectangular weave of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , using larger cu particles with @xmath90 nm and the same axis ratios as before . here",
    "@xmath91 nm . sector way is observed .",
    "finally , to get a better feeling of the nature of the meta - weave trapped modes , fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) shows the same solution but multiplied by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the distance from the source at the center .",
    "this clears out a @xmath94 decay due to 2d geometrical spreading .",
    "it is seen that now there is no decay at all along the sector central line .",
    "the same behavior applies to all the previous examples .        to conclude ,",
    "a new family of meta - surfaces , the meta - weaves , were suggested and studied .",
    "these meta - weaves are made of strongly non reciprocal or one - way threads based on the two - type rotation principle .",
    "it has been shown that they suggest a systematic generalization of the one - dimensional concept of broken time - reversal symmetry , and its extension to higher dimensions .",
    "the result is a surface that exhibit sector - way guiding features that may offer new ways to control the flow of light in thin surfaces ."
