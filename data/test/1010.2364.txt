    "cooling models form ballistic flows ( that is , a pair of cones each with a spherical base ) whose lateral edges become wrinkled by shear instabilities , see @xcite . * the scaling relations derived from the theory of radiatively driven winds can model the outflows from luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars , taking account of stellar rotation and the associated latitudinal variation of the stellar flux due to gravity darkening .",
