    "recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to the analysis and design of electromagnetic cloaking structures , since first proposed by pendry _ et al .",
    "the specially designed cloak is able to guide waves to propagate around its central region , rendering the objects placed inside invisible to external electromagnetic radiations .",
    "the ideal cloak in @xcite requires inhomogeneous and anisotropic media , with both permittivity and permeability independently controlled and radially dependent , making its practical realization very difficult .",
    "therefore it has been proposed to use simplified material parameters for both transverse electric ( te ) @xcite and transverse magnetic ( tm ) @xcite cases . in order to reduce the scattering due to the impedance mismatch introduced by the simplified cloaks , an improved linear cloak @xcite , a high - order transformation based cloak @xcite , and a ` square root ' transformation",
    "based cloak @xcite have also been proposed .",
    "the coordinate transformation technique used in @xcite has also been applied to the design of magnifying perfect and super lenses @xcite , electromagnetic field rotators @xcite , the reflectionless complex media for shifting and splitting optical beams @xcite , and conformal antennas @xcite etc .",
    "the experimental demonstration of a simplified cloak consisting of split - ring resonators ( srrs ) has been reported at microwave frequencies @xcite .",
    "for the optical frequency range , the cloak can be constructed by embedding silver wires in a dielectric medium @xcite , or using a gold - dielectric concentric layered structure @xcite .",
    "the modeling of pendry s invisible cloak has been performed by using both analytical and numerical methods . besides the widely used coordinate transformation technique @xcite , a cylindrical wave expansion technique @xcite , and a method based on the full - wave mie scattering model @xcite have also been applied .",
    "in addition , the full - wave finite element method ( fem ) based commercial simulation software comsol multiphysics@xmath0 has been extensively used to model different cloaks and validate theoretical predictions @xcite , due to its ability of dealing with anisotropic and radial dependent material parameters .",
    "however similar to other frequency domain techniques , the fem may become inefficient when wideband solutions are needed .",
    "so far , the time domain techniques that have been developed to model the cloaking structures include the time - dependent scattering theory @xcite , the transmission line method ( tlm ) @xcite and the finite - difference time domain ( fdtd ) method @xcite .",
    "due to its simplicity in implementation and the ability of treating anisotropic , inhomogeneous and nonlinear materials , the fdtd method has been extremely popular for the analysis of electromagnetic structures .",
    "however due to the computational complexity , so far the fdtd modeling of three - dimensional ( 3-d ) cloaking structures has not been attempted . in this paper , we extend our previously proposed 2-d fdtd method @xcite to the 3-d case and develop a parallel dispersive fdtd method to model 3-d cloaking structures and reveal the extraordinary behavior that is different from its counterparts under 2-d assumptions .",
    "a complete set of material parameters of the ideal cloak in spherical coordinate is given by @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the inner and outer radii of the cloak , respectively , and @xmath4 is the distance from a spatial point within the cloak to the center of the cloak .",
    "since the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are less than one ( between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , same as the case for left - handed materials ( lhms ) , the cloak can not be directly modeled using the conventional fdtd method .",
    "however , one can map the material parameters using dispersive material models , for example , the drude model @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the plasma and collision frequencies of the material , respectively . by varying the plasma frequency , the radial dependent material parameters in ( [ eq_parameter_ideal ] ) can be achieved .",
    "for example , for the ideal lossless case considered in this paper , i.e. the collision frequency in ( [ eq_drude ] ) is equal to zero ( @xmath12 ) , the radial dependent plasma frequency can be calculated using @xmath13 with a given value of @xmath5 calculated from ( [ eq_parameter_ideal ] ) . note that in practice , the plasma frequency of the material depends on the periodicity of the split ring resonators ( srrs ) @xcite or wires @xcite , which varies along the radial direction .",
    "it should be noted that other dispersive material models ( e.g. debye , lorentz etc . )",
    "can be also considered for the modeling of electromagnetic cloaks . however , the drude model has the simplest form when implemented using the dispersive fdtd method and has been widely used in the modeling of metamaterials .",
    "the lorentz model can be also used in fdtd simulations with some additional modifications to the iterative equations .",
    "the debye model may be less accurate to characterize the dispersion behavior of metamaterials and rarely used in the community .    since the conventional fdtd method @xcite deals with frequency - independent materials , the frequency - dependent fdtd method is hence referred as the dispersive fdtd method @xcite .",
    "there are also different dispersive fdtd methods using different approaches to deal with the frequency - dependent material parameters : the recursive convolution ( rc ) method @xcite , the auxiliary differential equation ( ade ) method @xcite and the @xmath14-transform method @xcite . due to its simplicity",
    ", we have chosen the ade method to model 3-d cloaks in this paper .",
    "the ade dispersive fdtd method is based on the faraday s and ampere s laws @xmath15 as well as the constitutive relations @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are expressed by ( [ eq_parameter_ideal ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq_maxwell_e ] ) and ( [ eq_maxwell_h ] ) can be discretized following a standard procedure @xcite , which leads to the conventional fdtd updating equations @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the discrete curl operator , @xmath22 is the discrete fdtd time step and @xmath23 is the number of the time steps .",
    "in addition , auxiliary differential equations need to be taken into account and they can be discretized through the following steps . for the conventional cartesian fdtd mesh , since the material parameters given in ( [ eq_parameter_ideal ] ) are in spherical coordinates , the following coordinate transformation is used @xcite @xmath24&\\!\\!\\!=&\\!\\!\\!\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } \\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi & \\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi & -\\sin\\phi\\\\ \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi & \\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi\\\\ \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{array}\\right ] \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } \\varepsilon_{r } & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\varepsilon_{\\theta } & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\varepsilon_{\\phi } \\end{array}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\cdot\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } \\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi & \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi & \\cos\\theta\\\\ \\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi & \\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi & -\\sin\\theta\\\\ -\\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi & 0 \\end{array}\\right ] .",

    "since the fdtd method is inherently a numerical technique , the spatial as well as time discretization has important effects on the accuracy of simulation results . also because the permittivity and permeability are frequency dependent , one can expect a slight difference between the analytical and numerical material parameters due to the discrete time step in the fdtd method . from our previous analysis @xcite that for the modeling of metamaterials especially the lhms ,",

    "the results calculated at each processor need to be combined to obtain the final simulation result . in comparison to conventional parallel fdtd method",
    ", the parallelization of the dispersive fdtd method introduced in this paper requires additional field components to be transferred between adjacent sub - domains during the synchronization process , because of the applied field averaging scheme .",

    "<S> a parallel dispersive finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method for the modeling of three - dimensional ( 3-d ) electromagnetic cloaking structures is presented in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the permittivity and permeability of the cloak are mapped to the drude dispersion model and taken into account in fdtd simulations using an auxiliary differential equation ( ade ) method . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the correction of numerical material parameters and the slow switching - on of source are necessary to ensure stable and convergent single - frequency simulations . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results from wideband simulations demonstrate that waves passing through a three - dimensional cloak experience considerable delay comparing with the free space propagations , as well as pulse broadening and blue - shift effects </S>",
