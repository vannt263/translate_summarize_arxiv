    "landau fermi - liquid theory has seen considerable success in describing a wide variety of fermionic many - particle systems , such as liquid helium-3 , electrons in metals , nuclei and nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "it gives an effective description of the low - lying elementary excitations ( quasiparticles ) at low temperatures , i.e. , at a temperature @xmath1 such that the system can be considered degenerate ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the chemical potential ) but still in the normal phase above any symmetry breaking phase transition ( @xmath4 ) , for example , to a magnetic or superconducting phase .",
    "nevertheless , the theory is not only important for the description of the above `` normal '' ( fermi - liquid ) phase , but is also vital to correctly describe the emergence of a possible ordered phase @xcite . indeed , according to the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory the onset of superconductivity is to be viewed as an instability of the fermi liquid under an attractive interaction , which results in the formation of cooper pairs @xcite . the same is true for magnetism in the case of repulsive interactions .",
    "in particular , bcs theory implies that the high - density and low - temperature region of the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) contains a color superconducting phase of quarks @xcite .",
    "in fact , since quarks carry color , flavor and spin quantum numbers , many distinct superconducting phases are possible and are characterized by the various symmetries of the cooper - pair wavefunction .",
    "these phases of cold and dense qcd might occur in the core of neutron stars where matter is compressed to several times the nuclear density @xmath5 .",
    "the presence of such a superconducting phase is expected to have observable consequences on the cooling and magnetic fields of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting phase is the so - called 2sc phase in which only two flavors of quarks are paired , while the unpaired quarks of the third flavor remain a fermi liquid .",
    "this phase further illustrates the importance of understanding the quark - gluon plasma , i.e. , the normal phase of quarks .    fortunately , due to asymptotic freedom , the coupling constant @xmath6 of qcd becomes small at large chemical potential @xmath3 , such that a systematic study of the high - density and low - temperature region of the qcd phase diagram is possible using perturbation theory . at high densities",
    "the dominant interaction between quarks is that of one - gluon exchange , where the long - range behavior of the gluons is screened due to the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "while the electric gluons ( longitudinal ) are screened by a debye mass @xmath7 , the magnetic ( transverse ) gluons are only dynamically screened @xcite .",
    "this residual long - range behavior of the magnetic gluons dominates the low - temperature behavior of the system .",
    "examples of the effects of magnetic gluons can be seen in the non - standard scaling of the critical temperature of the superconducting phase @xmath8 @xcite , which depends exponentially only on @xmath9 instead of showing the expected @xmath10 behavior , or of the life - time of elementary excitations of ( grand - canonical ) energy @xmath11 near the fermi surface @xmath12 @xcite that signal a ( marginal ) non - fermi - liquid behavior at zero temperature .    in the context of a possible deconfined phase of quarks inside neutron stars ,",
    "the fermi system is expected to be imbalanced due to the different chemical potentials of the various quarks .",
    "this deconfined phase may contain @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 quarks with different densities as a consequence of their different masses and charges . in cold atomic physics",
    ", an analogous population imbalance has been realized experimentally between two spin states @xcite , which resulted in frustration of the pairing between particles .",
    "this will cause very different behavior from the normal bcs case and is currently a very hot topic in a wide variety of fields @xcite . in particular , the imbalance between different flavors of quarks is expected to significantly alter the properties of the qcd phase diagram , such as the 2sc phase mentioned above or the color - flavor locked phase where all the colors and flavors are paired @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we therefore generalize the quasiparticle properties based on fermi - liquid theory to an imbalanced system .    to do so , the effect of the dressed gluons on the thermodynamic potential , specific heat and effective mass of the quasiparticles is determined at low temperatures .",
    "the thermodynamic potential will be calculated for a two - flavor quark system in the limit of a large number of quark flavors ( large-@xmath0 ) .",
    "this approximation corresponds to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , which has been quite successful in condensed - matter systems such as the interacting electron gas in metals @xcite . using the framework of landau fermi - liquid theory for relativistic systems , derived in section [ sec - theory ] ,",
    "the effective mass of the quasiparticles can be determined from the thermodynamic potential by considering the specific heat .",
    "the result and its implications on the applicability of fermi - liquid theory is discussed .",
    "as we will show , the logarithmic dependence of the temperature , which is due to the transverse gluons , shows the breakdown of fermi - liquid theory at low temperatures .",
    "furthermore , even though within our approximations there is no interaction between the different flavors of quarks in the limit of weak coupling , the rpa correction still presents some mixing between the different flavors , which stems from the long - wavelength screening of the longitudinal gluons . above and throughout the article natural units",
    "are used , i.e. , units such that @xmath16 . other conventions and technical details",
    "of the calculation can be found in the appendices .",
    "to describe the normal state of the quark - gluon plasma at nonzero temperatures , which is a strongly interacting gas of quarks , landau fermi - liquid theory can be used .",
    "this theory takes as a starting point the non - interacting fermi gas and switches on the interaction adiabatically .",
    "as long as the temperature of the system is much higher than the critical temperature @xmath17 for superconductivity , no bound states ( cooper pairs ) will form and each state of the non - interacting fermi gas is transformed into a state of the interacting gas .",
    "therefore , the excitations of such a fermi liquid remain of a fermionic nature . for simplicity",
    ", fermi - liquid theory will be introduced here for a system at zero temperature even though the quark - gluon plasma is formally a marginal fermi liquid in that case .",
    "however , the introduced concepts turn out to be valid for nonzero temperatures much lower than the fermi temperature @xmath18 , which is expected to be around @xmath19 for quarks in the core of neutron stars .",
    "the basis of landau fermi - liquid theory is to consider the effect of a small change of the ground - state fermi distribution on the thermodynamic potential density , which can be written as @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a small change in the ground - state momentum distribution of species @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the particle density , @xmath24 is the energy of a quasiparticle that for our purposes only depends on the magnitude of the vector @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the chemical potential . in the case of electrons",
    "the index @xmath22 specifies the spin of the electron , while for the case of quarks it specifies the spin , color and flavor of the quark .",
    "hence , the quasiparticle energy and the effective interaction between quasiparticles are defined as @xmath27    an important quantity in fermi - liquid theory is the effective mass @xmath28 of a quasiparticle of species @xmath22 near its fermi surface .",
    "it is defined in terms of the group velocity @xmath29 evaluated at the fermi momentum @xmath30 @xmath31_{k = k_\\sigma}^{-1},\\ ] ] such that upon linearizing the quasiparticle energy around the fermi surface we obtain @xmath32 with @xmath33 as the fermi energy of species @xmath22 . in the non - interacting limit ,",
    "the effective mass reduces to @xmath34 and @xmath35 for non - relativistic and relativistic dispersions , respectively .    using the fact that the pressure is an invariant under galilean or lorentz transformations ( see appendix .  [ app - invariance ] ) , of which",
