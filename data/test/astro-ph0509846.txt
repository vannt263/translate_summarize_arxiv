    "generation of surface gravity waves ( sgw ) , that are the best known sea and oceanic waves , are naturally associated with winds .",

    "fillips resonant mechanism is responsible for excitation and initial rising of wave motion on unexcited surface of the fluid ; miles mechanism  energy transfer from wind to fluid as a consequence of wind shear flow and surface waves interaction  is responsible for subsequent amplification of the waves . according to miles mechanism",
    "the energy source is wind shear flows situated outside the fluid .",
    "other ways of sgw generation have been also studied such as the possibility of sgw generation by earthquakes  @xcite and theory of sgw generation by intra - fluid explosions  @xcite . in theories mentioned above sources of sgw generation are extrinsic for the fluid .",
    "the question arises as to whether intrinsic for the fluid sources ( shear flows and vortex perturbations for example ) could generate sgw .",
    "this question become especially interesting in view of the impressive progress made in the understanding of spectrally stable shear flow phenomena by hydrodynamic community in the past ten years .",
    "the early transient period for the perturbations has been shown to reveal rich and complicate behavior in smooth ( without inflection point ) shear flows .",
    "particularly , it has been shown that the linear dynamics of perturbations in the flows are accompanied by intense temporal energy exchange processes between background flow and perturbations and/or between different modes of perturbations . from the mathematical point of view",
    "these effects are caused by the non - self adjointness of the linear operators in shear flows and are adequately described in the framework of so - called non - modal approach ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the non - modal approach implies a change of independent variables from the laboratory frame to a moving frame and the study of temporal evolution of _ spatial fourier harmonics _",

    "we examine the linear dynamics of surface waves and internal perturbations in deep fluid in the absence of wind and presence of the fluid flow with vertical shear of velocity .",
    "dispersive characteristics of shear modified sgws as well as linear mechanism of surface waves generation in deep fluid by internal perturbations is studied in detail in the framework of the non - modal approach .",

    "the shear parameter @xmath3 is considered to be positive for the simplicity . the gravitational field is considered to be uniform @xmath4 . generally , four modes of perturbation : sgw , internal gravity waves , sound waves and vortex mode can exist in the system . to reduce the mathematical complications as much as possible but still keep the basic physics of our analysis",
    ", we consider fluid to be incompressible ( which drops sound waves ) and neglect the stratification effects ( assuming that frequency of internal gravity waves is much less in comparison with the frequency of sgws , i.e. , considering internal gravity waves as aperiodic / vortex mode perturbations ) . in further analysis",
    "we ignore also effects of viscosity .",
    "after these simplifications we maintain just two modes of perturbation - sgw and vortex mode and write up the following differential equations for the linear dynamics of perturbations of velocity ( @xmath5 ) and normalized pressure ( @xmath6 ) :    @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    with the boundary condition on the surface @xmath0 : @xmath11    further we use the standard technique of the non - modal approach @xcite : introduction of co - moving variables @xmath12 let us to transform spatial inhomogeneity presented in eqs .",
