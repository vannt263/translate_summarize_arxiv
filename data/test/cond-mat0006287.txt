    "the transport of fluids through geological media such as hydrocarbon and water reservoirs involves a combination of flow through the microscopic pore space of the rock itself and flows through macroscopic channels such as fractures .",
    "the first case is relatively well understood , at least in principle @xcite , by means of models which treat the pore space as a random network , and then use effective medium or percolation concepts for the transport .",
    "fractures are typically modeled as simple straight - sided channels , with a cubic relation between fluid flux and average aperture , and a challenging problem is to understand the dynamics of flow in a macroscopic fracture network @xcite .",
    "typically the surface of a single fracture appears fairly smooth , aside from some small - scale superficially random roughness , and poiseuille flow in a straight channel is the obvious model for fluid flow .",
    "however , more careful analysis @xcite shows that common geological fractures in fact have correlated , self - affine fractal surfaces .",
    "the roughness exponent , whose precise definition is recalled below , is usually found @xcite to be close to 0.8 , surprisingly insensitive to the material and the fracturing process .",
    "( other values may arise from intergranular effects @xcite . )",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the permeability of single self - affine two - dimensional fractures .",
    "we shall see that it is possible to obtain general analytic expressions in two limiting cases , where the roughness associated with the fracture surface is either small or large compared to the mean aperture .",
    "the theoretical predictions will be supported by numerical simulations , using the lattice boltzmann method , which of course can address the case of intermediate sized roughness as well . in subsequent work",
    ", we will consider the fully three dimensional case , and go on to consider more general transport processes in fractures , involving both passive tracers and finite - sized suspended particles .",
    "complimentary experimental studies on laboratory samples of fractured rock are in progress elsewhere @xcite .    to the extent that the fluctuations in the height are small compared to the aperture width ,",
    "the effect on permeability is modest , and we will obtain small corrections to the usual cubic law , but the effects on other transport processes are much more significant .",
    "for example , passive tracer dispersion is very sensitive to the presence of any slow zones in the velocity field , and even uncorrelated roughness leads to significant long - time tails @xcite . similarly , the deposition and erosion of solid particles from a surface is sensitive to the local shear stress , which in turn can change dramatically as a surface roughens .    in the opposite extreme of a very narrow fracture , the flow field changes qualitatively as the fluid winds through a highly irregular channel . aside from the challenge of estimating the permeability of difficult geometry in terms of its statistical characteristics ,",
    "there are further effects arising from the fact that the two sides of the fracture originate from a single crack . in the fractal case , the spatial correlations between the two sides of a fracture lead to velocity field correlations , which again strongly affect tracer motion @xcite .",
    "the latter references made use of a very approximate velocity field , obtained in the lubrication limit , and one of the motivations of this paper is to examine the validity of the lubrication approximation for the velocity field .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first recall some basic facts about self - affine surfaces , and give the algorithm used to generate them numerically , and also explain the lattice boltzmann method used for the numerical simulations .",
    "we then consider the case of fractures with a wide average aperture , obtain a perturbative estimate for the permeability , and test it numerically .",
    "we then turn to narrow fractures , first in the case where the two sides are simply displaced normally to the mean fracture plane , and secondly when there is a lateral shift as well .",
    "finally , we summarize the results , and indicate the next steps",
    "we briefly review the mathematical characterization of self - affinity , and its implementation in this paper .",
    "we consider a rock surface without overhangs , whose height is given by a by a single - valued function @xmath0 , where the coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 lie in the mean plane of the fracture .",
    "self - affine surfaces @xcite display scale invariance with different dilation ratios along different spatial directions , remaining unchanged under the rescaling @xmath3 here we consider disordered media , so these scaling laws apply only in an ensemble or spatial average sense .",
    "experiment indicates that for many materials isotropy can be assumed in the mean plane , implying that there is only one non - trivial exponent relating the dilation ratio in the mean plane to the scaling in the perpendicular direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , with @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the roughness or hurst exponent @xcite .",
    "we assume that the process of fracturing the rock is `` clean '' , in the sense that the rock breaks so as separate along one single valued surface without subsequent deformation and without producing loose interstitial material .",
    "we shall emphasize two complimentary limiting situations , in which the two surfaces are either well separated with respect to each other , or very close to each other . if @xmath8 is the lateral size of the fracture in the mean plane , the typical range of the fluctuations ( the difference between the maximum and minimum values of @xmath9 ) scales as @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 is the mean width of the fracture , with @xmath12 , then the two cases correspond to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the local aperture of the crack is the key parameter determining the fracture permeability , and three different cases will be addressed . for large aperture , the roughness associated with the two sides of the fracture act independently , and it suffices to consider a channel with one rough and one smooth boundary . in the case of a narrow fracture , the correlation between the two sides is a key feature , and we consider two possibilities .",
    "we first study fractures where the upper surface has been simply translated a distance @xmath11 normal to the mean plane , so that the local aperture @xmath15 equals the constant @xmath11 .",
    "alternatively , the two surfaces may have a relative lateral displacement @xmath16 in the mean fracture plane , accompanied by a displacement @xmath11 in the perpendicular direction , so that the two surfaces do not overlap . in this case",
    "the local aperture is given by the random variable .",
    "@xmath17 it turns out @xcite that @xmath16 is the lateral correlation length for fluctuations in the aperture , in the sense that @xmath18 and @xmath19 decorrelate for @xmath20 .    in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the two dimensional case where the surface is invariant in the @xmath2 direction , @xmath21 , and the flow is forced in the @xmath1 direction by a constant pressure drop . in a subsequent paper we will extend these calculations to fully three dimensional fractures , but it is convenient , both conceptually and in the numerical simulations , to regard the system as having a translationally invariant third dimension .",
    "our aim is to study various aspects of the fracture permeability which are sensitive to the fracture roughness .",
    "the first ingredient is the height function @xmath0 , a statistically self - affine surface with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the periodicity is not a physically essential ingredient here , but has some calculational advantages in alleviating finite - size effects .",
    "the surface is generated by a fourier synthesis method , based on power - law filtering of arrays of independent random numbers @xcite .",
    "the random numbers are generated using a gaussian distribution , and then modulated by an appropriate power law .",
    "if @xmath22 is the fourier transform of the initial gaussian random array , then the fourier transform of the surface elevation is chosen to be @xmath23 ( the 1/2 is appropriate for the self - affine _ curve _ used here , and would be 1 for a real rock _",
    "surface_. )    in most cases the roughness exponent is chosen as the often - observed value @xmath24 . the amplitude of the roughness can be expressed in terms of variance of the height distribution over the full range , @xmath25 which in this case is @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "alternatively , the amplitude is given indirectly in terms of the range of the fluctuations as @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "in these equations , and in the rest of the paper , the unit of length is that of the spacing between lattice points in the numerical calculations .    since we consider fluid flow in a highly irregular geometry , and eventually hope to consider dispersion and the evolution of the solid surface due to particle transport , the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method @xcite is particularly convenient . in this algorithm",
    ", fictitious particles move between neighboring sites on a lattice , with suitable collision rules , and the boundary of the flow domain is simply a surface of sites where the rule is modified in some way to keep the particles out .",
    "we use the face centered hypercubic ( fchc - projected ) version of the lb model , with a cubic lattice in 3 dimensions and 19 velocities ( d3q19 in the terminology of @xcite ) .",
    "the collision operator is approximated by a single relaxation time , the bhatnagar - gross - krook model@xcite , and the local equilibrium distribution given by @xcite is used .",
    "this pseudo - equilibrium distribution locally preserves mass and momentum values , and is formulated specifically to recover the navier - stokes equation at large length and time scales . for the no - slip solid boundaries",
    ", we use the simplest implementation of particle exclusion  the bounce - back rule , in which a particle incident on the boundary reverses its direction .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used for the inflow and outflow surfaces .",
    "a constant pressure gradient forcing the fluid is added in the @xmath1 direction , while the gap between surfaces extends over @xmath9 , and the geometry is taken to be translation invariant in @xmath2 .",
    "in this section we consider the case of a channel with one fractally - rough wall , in the limit where the mean width is large compared to the amplitude of the roughness .",
    "we ( re-)derive an elegant general result for the permeability , and then an exact variant which gives the permeability of a perturbed pore space . if the pore space perturbation is weak , the leading order correction is easy to evaluate and , when compared to numerical simulation , is seen to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the permeability .",
    "we begin by deriving an integral representation for the permeability , and then considering a perturbation in the boundary shape .",
    "although we suspect that these results are known to many , we are not aware of an earlier publication containing them , although the electrical analog of the integral representation is in the literature @xcite .",
    "consider a rectangular volume of a porous medium , periodic in all directions , and the following surface integral @xmath30\\ ] ] here , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the velocity and pressure fields of a fluid which completely fills the pore space , assumed to satisfy the stokes equations , and the surface @xmath33 is the complete boundary of the pore space , consisting of the inner grain surfaces and the porous regions of the outer boundary .",
    "the pressure and velocity fields are periodic , except that the pressure jumps by a constant amount @xmath34 between two opposite faces in one direction , that of the mean flow .",
    "now the velocity vanishes on the grain boundaries by the no - slip condition , and there is complete cancelation between the opposite faces in the two completely periodic directions , but in the flow direction the remaining two faces of the box combine to give @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the fluid flux through this end face @xmath37 , and the minus sign arises because the outward normal is used in @xmath38 .",
    "the last equality follows from darcy s law , where @xmath33 is the area of end @xmath37 , @xmath39 is the permeability , @xmath40 the fluid viscosity , and @xmath8 the length of the box .    on the other hand ,",
    "applying the divergence theorem to eq .",
    "[ surface ] , we obtain : @xmath41 where the volume @xmath42 is just the pore space .",
    "we have used first the incompressibility of the fluid , second the stokes equation , and third integration by parts . comparing the two expressions for @xmath38",
    ", we have @xmath43 the analogous formula for the electrical conductivity @xmath44 , which follows from ohm s law and the laplace equation @xcite , is @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the conductivity of the pore fluid , @xmath47 is the potential and @xmath48 its difference across the sample . note that both of these formulae may also be derived by comparing the energy dissipation rate computed microscopically in the pore space to the same quantity computed using average fields .",
    "we next derive an exact variant of the integral expression for the permeability ( [ permeability ] ) due to wilkinson @xcite , which allows us to implement a perturbation analysis .",
    "suppose we begin with a pore volume @xmath49 and known stokes equation solutions @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and then _ contract _ the volume to @xmath42 , where the exact ( but unknown ) solution is @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the result to follow is true even if the volume change and alterations in the fields are _ not _ small , but are probably only useful in that limit , hence the suggestive subscript @xmath54 . substituting into the dissipation integral on the right hand of eq",

    "finally , we obtain @xmath61\\ ] ]    this result is exact but not useful",
    ". however , note that if the relative change in volume is small , @xmath62 , the second term is second order in the small parameter , so that to first order the decrease in permeability involves only the integral of the unperturbed velocity over the deleted region , which is easy to calculate .      in this section",
    "we will determine the decrease in permeability due to the presence of a self - affine perturbation in the lower surface of a straight channel , and in particular its dependence on the size of the channel . to use the previous result , we begin with a straight channel of width @xmath63 which completely contains the rough - walled one ( see fig .",
    "[ fracture ] ) , where we have poiseuille flow @xmath64 and an unperturbed permeability @xmath65 .",
    "the lower boundary is shifted by @xmath66 , where we assume that that range @xmath67 of @xmath9 satisfies",
    "the only surviving velocity derivative is @xmath69 so that the dissipation integral is simply @xmath70 up to first order in @xmath54 this becomes @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the average of @xmath9 over the channel length @xmath8 , and the cross - sectional area is @xmath73 .",
    "the mean perturbation @xmath72 is computable for a specific profile , but here we wish to use a statistical characterization and relate it to the average properties of an ensemble of self - affine surfaces .",
    "the mean height of the surface is half the range , and therefore has the scaling @xmath74 . substituting , and replacing the previous equation in eq .",
    "[ permeability ] we obtain the first - order perturbative correction to the permeability @xmath75\\ ] ] we have added an adjustable parameter @xmath76 , which is expected to lie between @xmath77 , to take account of the distinction between open volume and flowing volume .",
    "a value @xmath78 means that the fracture is equivalent to a straight channel of height equal to the mean height of the surface . on the other hand",
    ", a value @xmath79 means that the whole region of fluid below the maximum excursion of the surface is not contributing to the permeability and the system is equivalent to the maximum channel that does not intersect the surface .",
    "note the lowest order correction to the permeability obtained here results from the reduced volume of a fracture compared to that of a straight channel enclosing it , and happens to coincide with the lubrication approximation .",
    "the approach taken here allows us to gain some insight in the drawbacks of this approximation and further improve them . using the previous equation we may write the first order correction to the flow rate , @xmath80\\ ] ]    to verify this prediction , we consider a pore space consisting of a cubic lattice with periodic boundaries in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one impermeable wall at @xmath81 , and a self - affine rough boundary lying above @xmath82 .",
    "we generate an ensemble of 10 self - affine surfaces with exponent @xmath24 , as discussed above . in fig .",
    "[ q - vs - size ] we display the correction to the flow rate as a function of the size of the system @xmath8 . the straight line is a fit to the expected exponent , which does reasonably well except at the smallest and largest values of @xmath1 .",
    "the origins of the discrepancies are first that the discretization used in the numerical calculation suppresses any roughness less than one unit , which is a significant fraction of the system for small @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the system should be periodic in @xmath8 , but the numerical algorithm used to generate it assumes a system size that is a power of 2 . as usual",
    ", there are computational limitations on the sizes we can simulate , and for lengths between 32 and the accessible maximum of 64 , we just truncate the periodic surface . finally , at the largest system sizes , we are really outside the range of validity of the estimates .",

    "expressed in terms of the surface height variance @xmath85 instead of the span range , the excluded fluid represents @xmath86 of the roughness region .",
    "the physical consideration absent in the leading order perturbation calculation is the fact that fluid velocity sharply decays inside depressions and corners were resistive eddies are likely to occur @xcite .",

    "the previous profile , @xmath91 for @xmath92 , is rescaled so as to have unit variance , and then multiplied by an adjustable amplitude @xmath93 , giving adjustable variance @xmath94 .",
    "if we assume that the effect of the boundary perturbation is to give low velocity zones which do not contribute to the flow , and that the volume of these zones contributing to the dissipation integral is proportional to @xmath93 , we would write in analogy to eq .",

    "further evidence for our arguments concerning the effects of low - velocity zones can be adduced by showing that the permeability is unchanged if they are deleted .",
    "we begin with the family of adjustable - amplitude self - affine surface just discussed , and filter out the smallest wavelengths from the spectrum so as to generate a smother surface .",

    "we address the complimentary case where the fracture is distinctly open .    as discussed in section 2 , in the presence of a lateral shift @xmath16",
    ", the fracture aperture is now the random function @xmath18 given by eq .",
    "[ aperture ] rather than the constant @xmath11 .",
    "however , there is a residual correlation between the two sides of the fracture , which allows us to relate the permeability to the self - affine statistics .",
    "first , we determine a condition on the shift for the fracture to be open . provided the average properties of the surface are statistically stationary ( independent of @xmath1 ) , we have @xmath170 , and the variance of the aperture distribution is @xmath171 ^ 2 \\rangle = \\langle [ z(x+d)-z(x)]^2 \\rangle = \\sigma_z^2(d ) = \\phi(\\ell )   \\left ( { d\\over \\ell } \\right)^{2\\zeta}\\ ] ] the aperture is surely open when @xmath172 , which gives @xmath173 , but from eq .",
    "[ delta - h ] , this is just @xmath174 . in other words ,",
    "the shift must be small compared to the typical length of a straight segment of unshifted channel , and there is little change in the geometry compared to the unshifted case .",
    "we expect , therefore , that the previous result eq .",
    "[ flow - disp ] should apply at least up to a different value of the numerical coefficient @xmath146 .    in fig .",
    "[ fshift ] we show lb simulation results for the correction to the unperturbed flow rate @xmath147 , for different values of the shift @xmath16 .",
    "we see that the behavior is consistent with these arguments for all values of the shift , with deviations occurring when the shift is too large for the mean aperture .",
    "several other shift values were simulated obtaining the same general behaviors as in those shown in fig .",
    "[ fshift ] .",
    "as is often the case with this type of scaling argument , reasoning in terms of asymptotic limits leads to conditions that one quantity must be _ much _ larger than another , but in practice the range of validity is much wider .",
    "we have studied the permeability of two - dimensional self - affine fractures , using asymptotic analytic arguments for wide and narrow apertures .",
    "numerical simulations using the lattice boltzmann method have verified the predictions , and also suggest a smooth crossover between the limits used in the derivations .",
    "we have obtained expressions for the permeability in which the usual expression for straight channels is modified by terms related to the hurst exponent characterizing the fracture surface .    in the wide - gap case",
    ", we obtained a perturbative correction related to the roughness exponent and amplitude .",
    "the result is formally identical to the lubrication theory prediction , but the corrections are known , in principle , and furthermore we can understand the discrepancies between the derived numerical coefficient and simulation in terms of the effects of low - velocity zones which do not contribute to transport . in the narrow gap case , we also derive an analytic correction related to the roughness exponent and amplitude ( or microscopic length @xmath116 ) .",
    "the analysis is based in a local lubrication approximation , dividing the whole fracture into a chain of approximately linear channels with varying orientation angles respect to the main flow direction .",
    "the results is equivalent to a correction due to the tortuosity of the fracture , where the tortuosity itself depends on the gap size .",
    "finally , we show that in the case when there is a lateral shift between the surfaces , there is no qualitative change compared to the unshifted case .",
    "this is basically due to the two dimensional geometry , where in order to have an open channel the shift must be small compared to the size of the typical length of a quasi - linear segment of unshifted fracture .",
    "the two - dimensional nature of the problem imposes restrictions on the range of validity of analytic estimates , but the numerical results are in general agreement over a much wider range .",
    "the extension of this work to fully three - dimensional fractures is in progress .",
    "the case of a wide gap does not require any further significant conceptual effort . however , the narrow gap case the fracture geometry is significantly more complicated because it is not feasible to use any quasi - one - dimensional approximation for the flow paths .",
    "numerical simulations are certainly feasible , at least up to size limits imposed by one s computational hardware , but additional ideas are required for analytic arguments .",
    "future work will consider diffusion , and also convection plus diffusion , in these self - affine fractures , in both two and three dimensions .",
    "the lb method is quite simple for numerical simulations , and we will explore the way in which the roughness exponent enters into the quantitative behavior , along the lines given here .",
