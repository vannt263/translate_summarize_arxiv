    "several years ago , observations of supernovae of type ia ( sne ia ) demonstrated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "associated with this acceleration is dark energy , a component of the universe with negative pressure , that makes up a significant fraction of the total energy density .",
    "recent years have seen the supernova evidence for dark energy continue to mount @xcite",
    ". meanwhile , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data from the wmap project @xcite , in combination with information about either the hubble constant @xcite or the galaxy power spectrum @xcite , also requires the existence of dark energy .",
    "cross - correlations between cmb anisotropies and matter power spectrum inhomogeneities provide evidence for a late - time integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite .",
    "this isw effect indicates a recent change in the inhomogeneous gravitational potential , providing further evidence for dark energy .",
    "one way to characterize the dark energy is to measure its equation of state , the ratio @xmath8 of its pressure @xmath9 and energy density @xmath10 .",
    "the simplest model of the dark energy is a cosmological constant @xmath11 , which has a constant @xmath12 .",
    "quintessence models describe the dark energy as a dynamical scalar field with an equation of state @xmath13 , and in general , @xmath0 will not be constant in time @xcite .",
    "furthermore , models of extended quintessence or `` phantom energy '' even allow @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "models of the universe incorporating a cosmological constant or quintessence , in addition to cold dark matter , are known as @xmath11cdm or qcdm models , respectively .",
    "discovering whether or not the dark energy is a cosmological constant is the primary goal of the study of dark energy .",
    "if dark energy is shown not to be a cosmological constant , then the next important issues are whether or not @xmath14 , which can be theoretically problematic @xcite ( however , see @xcite for an alternative viewpoint ) , and whether or not @xmath0 is changing with time . while a quintessence with constant @xmath15 is very difficult to distinguish quantitatively from a cosmological constant , the qualitative difference for fundamental physics is enormous , so it is critical that the maximum effort be made to reduce the uncertainty in @xmath16 and its time derivative .",
    "ultimately , the precise quantitative values of @xmath0 and its time derivative are important for model building , but this is less crucial , at present , than the qualitative issue of whether the dark energy is dynamical or not . in order to address such questions about the nature of the dark energy ,",
    "it is crucial that the equation of state and its time variation be determined observationally .",
    "it has been known for some time that the cosmological probes used for stuyding the dark energy are plagued by numerous parameter degeneracies @xcite . because of these degeneracies ,",
    "a large uncertainty in a cosmological parameter not directly related to the dark energy sector ( _ e.g. _ , the matter density ) can lead to a large uncertainty in the dark energy equation of state .",
    "this sensitivity to other parameters means that one must incorporate the uncertainties in all parameters to obtain a realistic estimate of the uncertainties in the dark energy equation of state .",
    "in particular , one should avoid the use of strong priors on the form of @xmath17 , the values of other parameters , and independent information coming from other experiments .",
    "these can lead to underestimates of the uncertainty in @xmath0 by a very large factor .",
    "we will also discuss how standard likelihood marginalization can give a misleading impression of the uncertainty in @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis presented here employs a @xmath18 minimization procedure in order to avoid possible problems with marginalization , and assumes only weak prior constraints .",
    "we compare our @xmath18 minimization with the standard approach , the marginalization of a probability function computed using monte carlo markov chains .",
    "it is argued that our procedure gives a more conservative assessment of constraints in certain degenerate parameter spaces . in this sense ,",
    "our procedure and the markov chain are complementary , as we will discuss .",
    "we apply this @xmath18 minimization analysis to the currently available data .",
    "the simultaneous determination of the dark energy equation of state and its red shift derivative is difficult without the combination of data from several cosmological probes .",
    "thus we analyze the latest data from wmap , sn ia searches , and the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "strong priors are avoided to prevent the underestimation of dark energy constraints .",
    "although the data favor @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we are unable to rule out the cosmological constant conclusively .",
    "furthermore , we find the constraints on @xmath17 to depend strongly on the parameterization chosen for @xmath17 , as well as on the location of the best - fit model in parameter space , despite the fact that we have restricted our study to two - parameter equations of state . we also list possible biases in the cosmological probes , and discuss their effects on our results .",
    "our conclusion that the cosmological constant is consistent with current data agrees with previous analyses , as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "this establishes the validity of our analytic methods , which we can then apply with confidence to projections of future measurements .    since the cosmological constant is consistent with current data , it is useful to ask precisely how well dark energy may be constrained in the future using known cosmological probes .",
    "we address this question by applying our @xmath18 minimization procedure to simulations of the data from these probes .",
    "besides the cmb and sne ia , we simulate data from a probe of weak gravitational lensing ( wl ) . in the future",
    ", wl is expected to be useful for constraining dark energy @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have demonstrated that wl breaks parameter degeneracies in the cmb analysis , and have shown the effectiveness of the combination of cmb and wl data in constraining dark energy .",
    "our study is the first to use a joint analysis of simulated cmb , sn ia , and wl data , rather than imposing prior constraints as a `` replacement '' for one of these data sets .",
    "this is especially important for parameters such as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which have strong degeneracies with other parameters .",
    "since our goal is the study of @xmath17 constraints , rather than general parameter constraints , we assume the cosmological model outside of the dark energy sector to be as simple as possible . within this model , we are careful to avoid strong priors on the cosmological parameters .",
    "it is well understood that each of these cosmological probes has systematic uncertainties associated with it , and that significant progress needs to be made in order for each one to reach the level of precision necessary for constraining dark energy .",
    "therefore , we attempt at every opportunity to strike a reasonable balance between optimism and realism .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ subsec : demodel ] discusses several parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state .",

    "in the spirit of reasonable optimism , we have assumed that the dark energy may be parameterized using an equation of state @xmath23 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the pressure and dark energy density , respectively , and @xmath17 is an unknown function of red shift .",
    "we have also assumed that the dark energy sound speed is @xmath24 . without any theoretical guidance about the form of @xmath17 ,",
    "the space of all possibilities is equivalent to an uncountably infinite set of cosmological parameters .",
    "the data depend on @xmath17 only through a multiple integral relation @xcite , so we lack the large number of measurements of @xmath17 that would be necessary for non - parametric inference @xcite",
    ". thus we must describe @xmath17 using a small number of parameters in order to keep the analysis tractable .",
    "the danger is that there is no `` natural '' way to parameterize @xmath17 , so the choice of parameterizations is essentially arbitrary .",
    "ideally , one would like to verify that any constraints obtained on @xmath17 are parameterization - independent .",
    "however , the space of all possible parameterizations is infinite - dimensional , so we re back to square one . the only feasable option is to test for parameterization - independence by comparing constraints on a small number of `` reasonable - looking '' parameterizations .    to begin with , we assume that @xmath17 is an analytic function , and that it can be approximated at @xmath25 by the first few terms in its taylor series about @xmath5 .",
    "all known probes are sensitive to an integral of some function of @xmath17 , rather than to @xmath17 itself , so any `` bumps and wiggles '' in @xmath17 are effectively smoothed out .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this smoothed @xmath17 can be approximated by a low - degree polynomial in @xmath1 out to @xmath26 . from now on we proceed based on this assumption , with the caveat that the `` true '' equation of state can have added `` bumps and wiggles '' that disappear when smoothed .",

    "[ fig:2_sigma_w_vs_z ] . without weak lensing , @xmath17 is well constrained only around @xmath111",

    "the result is a @xmath17 uncertainty that is not only lower , but much more uniform across the red shift range .",

    "secondly , the constraint @xmath115 at @xmath102 is tight enough that this combination of data can distinguish between the cosmological constant and tracker models of dark energy .",
    "thus , weak lensing will allow us to rule out a portion of the most interesting region of parameter space .",
    "on the other hand , our forecast dark energy constraints do not reach the third milestone , which calls for these @xmath2 uncertainties to be reduced to @xmath116 .",
    "in particular , the uncertainty in @xmath77 is higher than this by over an order of magnitude .",
    "we have not included in our analysis either weak lensing tomography or galaxy cluster measurements , which may lower statistical uncertainties even further @xcite .",
    "these have been analyzed by others and look promising .",
    "they suggest that we can approach the third milestone , but there is no method suggested so far for pushing substantially beyond their forecast constraints .    moreover , we remind the reader that the constraints discussed above , as well as the improvement due to weak lensing , are based on several optimistic assumptions listed at the beginning of sec .

    "systematic effects , such as dust - related dimming of the supernovae , can increase uncertainties in @xmath76 and @xmath77 . also , if the best - fit dark energy model is near the boundary of the ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) parameter space , then @xmath17 parameterization dependence will further weaken our constraints on the dark energy parameters . in the worst - case scenario @xmath117 , the best fit model will be near the boundary of parameter space ; parameterization - related uncertainties in @xmath76 and @xmath22 could completely swamp any improvements .",
    "the purpose of this investigation has been to determine how well @xmath17 can be resolved using currently planned astronomical observations .",
    "the well - known challenge is that individual measurements do not constrain @xmath17 directly , but rather some functional that depends on @xmath17 , integrals of @xmath17 , and a large set of additional parameters .",
    "we have shown that the uncertainties in measuring @xmath0 and @xmath4 at @xmath5 can be reduced dramatically by the beginning of the next decade , using a combination of the highest - quality cmb , sn , and wl data .",
    "however , the remaining uncertainties , @xmath3 and @xmath7 , will not be enough to determine definitively whether dark energy is inert ( a cosmological constant ) or dynamical ( quintessence ) , unless the true value of @xmath0 differs from @xmath30 by significantly more than @xmath88 .",

    "we have shown that the cmb contribution to this degeneracy breaking comes entirely from the @xmath52 region of the power spectrum . since even the first year of wmap data has reduced uncertainties in this range to near the cosmic variance level , we do not expect a significant improvement in dark energy constraints from further wmap or planck cmb data .",
