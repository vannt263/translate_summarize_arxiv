    "particle gels form in suspensions if short - range attractions act between contacting surfaces of particles . depending on the strength of the attraction",
    ", one can distinguish them as two types : strongly and weakly aggregated particle gels  @xcite . in strongly aggregated particle gels , on which we focus in this work , particles once joined hardly separate at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "the attractions also prevent tangential displacements of contacting particles  @xcite , thus particles form sample - spanning loose networks .",
    "their remarkable and complex mechanical properties under external stress are essentially due to the response of a deformable disordered network formed with all the particles .    under shear stress",
    ", one can sketch out deformation of a particle gel as follows  @xcite :    * the system is elastic under very low stresses .",
    "if the stress is released , the system comes back to the original shape ; * for larger stress , a particle gel may undergo finite deformations , though it does not flow .",
    "this is the plastic regime , and it gives malleability ; i.e. , the system mostly keeps the deformed shape if stress is released ; * beyond a yield stress , the particles network is ruptured and the particle gel flows .",
    "fluids exhibiting these behavior are called _ yield stress _ ( or _ bingham plastic _ ) fluids  @xcite .",
    "since the yield stress is the highest stress that can prevent flow , it can be considered as the strength of particle gels .",
    "naturally , this strength relates to the strength of the particle connections . in a particle gel under shear stress ,",
    "transmitting stresses break a portion of particle connections and the sample spanning network is torn apart .",
    "the yield stress of particle gels is higher when the packing fraction of particles is larger . in many cases",
    ", this variation appears to follow a power law with exponents between 4 and 5  @xcite .    under compressive stress ,",
    "the behavior of a particle gel looks different , due to confinement  @xcite .",
    "compressive stress appears naturally in a number of applications , for example paste drying  @xcite or ceramic processing  @xcite .",
    "osmotic compression is a generic important case . in this kind of compression process",
    ", liquid removal tends to pack the particles into a smaller volume .",
    "as long as the applied stress is lower than the strength of the gel , it will retain the volume .",
    "if the stress exceeds a compressive yield stress @xmath2 , network restructuring leads to the loss of a part of the liquid phase , and particles reorganize into a smaller volume  @xcite .",
    "the deformation stops when the mechanical resistance of the network equals the stress .",
    "thus , unlike the shear case , deformation does not continue with a constant applied stress  @xcite .",
    "the growth of mechanical resistance , i.e. compressive consolidation , also shows a highly nonlinear dependence on the packing fraction , typically power - law relations @xmath3 with exponents between 3.2 and 4.5  @xcite .",
    "the highly nonlinear dependency of the compressive yield stress @xmath2 on the packing fraction @xmath4 relates to the heterogeneity of the network structure of particles  @xcite .",
    "the fractal model  @xcite successfully captures such packing - fraction dependence of rheological proprieties by considering the characteristic structure of strongly aggregated particle gels . in the model , a particle gel",
    "is assumed to be an assembly of fractal flocssuch structural correlation is evidenced by scattering observations  @xcite .",
    "the entire sample is filled up with flocs of a fractal dimension @xmath0 , and the correlation length @xmath1 is equivalent or proportional to the average size of the flocs .",
    "thus , the correlation length @xmath1 can be associated with the packing fraction @xmath4 by using the fractal dimension @xmath0 : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the spatial dimension and proportional coefficient . under this assumption ,",
    "a gel of a higher packing fraction consists of a higher number of smaller flocs of the same fractal dimension @xmath0 . by deducing average mechanical responses of the flocs ,",
    "the fractal model predicts a power - law dependence of the shear modulus on @xmath4 with an exponent @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fractal dimension of the backbone structure .",
    "although this theoretical prediction has often been cited in the literature , we should pay attention to the scope of the model . since fractal correlation yields in the formation process of particle gels",
    ", there is no clear reason for @xmath0 and @xmath9 to be kept constant during the compression process .",
    "actually , some scattering observations indicate that the compression process changes the local structure ( fractal dimension )  @xcite . to make progress in macroscopic modeling of aggregated colloidal or particle gels  @xcite",
    ", we need to settle such microstructural issues .",
    "there is a recent two - dimensional(2d ) simulation work to support the application of the fractal model to compression processes  @xcite .",
    "gels which were ( i ) directly prepared to the packing fraction @xmath4 , or ( ii ) prepared by compression from a lower packing - fraction gel @xmath10 showed the same structural characteristics . however , the investigated range of packing fractions was relatively high ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "since the fractal model targets on strongly aggregated gels , we should compare simulations at lower packing fractions .",
    "indeed , our 2d simulation investigates a wider range of packing fractions ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this article reports results of numerical simulation for compression of particulate networks to discuss the consolidation behavior with restructuring .",
    "experimentally observed time evolution of compressed gels should be affected by both the hydrodynamic and network resistances  @xcite .",
    "but , we here focus on studying the latter ; our simulation work investigates the quasi - static structural evolution determined by the balance between external stresses and network strength at long time .",
    "this limitation to quasi - static aspects is common with the above - mentioned fractal model .",
    "so , compression considered in this work is sufficiently slow , such as osmotic compression .",
    "a contact model is employed to simulate sticky and breakable connections between contacting particles . in granular physics , there are many prior studies to investigate cohesive granular system  @xcite .",
    "their simulation methods are an extension of the discrete element method  @xcite ; the rolling friction has been additionally included into the contact model .",
    "though our target is a suspension system , the spirit of the modeling is almost the same . in granular physics , there are also some studies on compression of cohesive powders  @xcite , which obtained many common insights with our study .",
    "2d simulation results are reported here .",
    "one obvious benefit of studying 2d systems is easy recognition of the structure changes .",
    "though the density - density correlation is an effective tool to capture special sorts of heterogeneous structures , it might not capture all features of random structures .",
    "2d experimental system has also been studied to observe the microstructure change under shear  @xcite .",
    "though we do not expect qualitative difference between 2d and 3d systems , this point should be checked by 3d simulation of the same modeling , which we hope to report in future work .",
    "we use fractal aggregation models to generate the initial configurations . networks of particles are formed in a rectangle box of sides @xmath13 and @xmath14 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we combine two processes .",
    "the first step models a formation process of fractal clusters in the dilute limit ; the reaction - limited hierarchical cluster - cluster aggregation model was employed  @xcite .",
    "each cluster consists of @xmath15 particles .",
    "the second step is to build a network with them .",
    "@xmath16 of the generated clusters are randomly placed in the box while avoiding overlap with each other , and then they are moved with a random walk .",
    "collisions of clusters always lead to coalescence , so a single cluster is formed in the periodic boundary space after a while ( see , e.g. ,  [ fig_snapshots ]  ( a ) , below ) .",
    "thus , we can generate random networks of a packing fraction @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the radius of a particle .",
    "one can deduce structural features of the formed networks by evaluating the density - density correlation function @xmath19 ( see appendix [ appendix_density - correlation ] ) .",

    "our contact model is designed to simulate strongly aggregated particle gels . the contact model used in the original discrete element method ( dem )  @xcite takes into account friction forces for the sliding mode , which is essential to simulate dense granular systems .",
    "for cohesive granular systems , the rolling friction has been added  @xcite .",
    "this extension is also required to reproduce the behavior of particle gels having chain - like local structures .",
    "our implementation is similar to the model used for cohesive granular systems .",
    "since the dynamic friction , which is modeled in typical contact models , is unclear for colloidal systems , this part is different in our model .",
    "though a brief summary will be given below , the detailed descriptions of our implementation were given in another paper  @xcite .",
    "we assume that interactions acting among particles are only short range forces .",
    "no interparticle interaction acts between two particles before getting into contact .",
    "once the gap between two particles becomes zero , a cohesive force starts to act between them . for simplicity ,",
    "our simulation model assumes immediate bond generation , which is expected to give the upper limit of the consolidation behavior .",
    "when compression - rate dependence is problem , the condition of bond generation can be crucial .",
    "finite compression rates can suppress bond generation , leading to a weaker consolidation .",
    "the forces and moments are assumed to be hookian : let us consider the contact interactions between particles @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the center - to - center distance between them is @xmath30 , and the gap @xmath31 .",

    "the second term of eq .   is added to avoid significant overlap between particles .",
    "the sliding displacement @xmath38 relates to the tangential part of the contact force , @xmath39 the sliding displacement @xmath38 is the tangential projection of the deviation vector between the original contact points @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 where the vectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 indicate the original contact points from the respective centers of the particles and are fixed with them .",
    "the bending angle @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is related to the moment acting on the rolling mode , @xmath47    these elastic relations are broken when the force or moment exceed threshold values .",
    "we assume simple criteria given with three threshold values : the critical normal force @xmath48 , critical sliding force @xmath49 , and critical rolling moment @xmath50 .",
    "when the pulling force exceeds the value ; @xmath51 , the bond is broken and the two particles separate . when the tangential force or rolling torque exceeds the threshold value ; @xmath52 or @xmath53 , both the sliding displacement @xmath54 and rolling angle @xmath55 are reset to zero , which releases the tangential parts of the stored energy .",
    "the maximum strains are related to the threshold forces and moment as follows : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "it must be noted that in our simple model the bond strength of the tangential mode does not depend on the normal load .",
    "however , the enlarged contact area due to the normal load may change the tangential strengths  @xcite .",
    "our neglect of this effect can affect simulations at higher packing fractions .",
    "a particle @xmath28 may be in contact with other particles @xmath29 . the total contact force and torque acting on the particle @xmath28",
    "can be written as follows : @xmath59 particles are immersed in a viscous fluid , so that hydrodynamic interactions also act on them . for micro or nano - sized particles ,",
    "the particle reynolds number is extremely small , so the stokes equations should be used to evaluate the hydrodynamic interactions among many particles  @xcite . however , we do not go into the detailed hydrodynamics here .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions in the stokes regime are scaled with the velocities of particles .",
    "if the slow compression limit is considered , flows induced by particle movements are negligible in comparison with the contact forces .",
    "they just work as energy dissipators .",
    "indeed , some experimental observations suggest that a solvent flow does not contribute the rearrangements of particles in a slow sedimentation of colloidal gels  @xcite .    as an approximation ,",
    "the stokes formula is used in this work ; the force and torque acting on a particle @xmath28 are proportional to the translational velocity @xmath60 and angular velocity @xmath61 , respectively : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the viscosity of the solvent . since the interparticle interactions are assumed to be sufficiently stronger than thermal agitations , brownian forces are also neglected in this work .",
    "consequently , newton s equations of motions are given as the sum of the contact forces and hydrodynamic interactions , @xmath64 since particle inertia is very small for colloidal systems , it is a good approximation to neglect the inertia terms ( the left hand sides ) and solve the force balance equations  @xcite .",
    "as explained later ( sect .",
    "[ 141932_2nov12 ] ) , however , we took a different strategy to find the static equilibriums .",
    "the compression is externally controlled . for simplicity ,",
    "we focus on examining the uni - axial compression along the @xmath65 axis in this work .",
    "the periodic boundaries at @xmath66 and @xmath67 of the simulation box introduced in section  [ sec_preparation_fractal_gel ] are replaced by two flat walls .",
    "these walls can move along the @xmath65-axis like pistons , and they are assumed to be semipermeable ; liquid passes through them , while particles do not .",
    "when particles get in contact with the walls , they are rigidly fixed there ; particles contacting with the wall move together as one object .",
    "the periodic boundaries along the @xmath68-axis are still used during the compression simulation .",
    "the stress - controlled compression , in which an external stress is applied to cause the compression , is similar to typical experimental situations , such as osmotic compression .",
    "however , due to the higher efficiency of the simulation , we use strain - controlled compression .",
    "this also allows us to have better statistics in our data .",
    "this work investigates the slow compression limit ; the time scale of compression is much longer than the relaxation time of particle motions . in this case , the results obtained with the strain - controlled compression are essentially equivalent to the ones with the stress - controlled compression .",
    "the compressive stress balancing the network resistance is evaluated from the total forces acting on the walls from particles .",
    "since particles directly connecting to the walls ( called wall particles ) no longer have any mechanical freedom , the forces between wall particles @xmath28 and particles @xmath29 contacting with them are summed up as follows : @xmath69 when we refer to `` compressive stress '' in this 2d simulation work , our simulation box is assumed to have a thickness of particle diameter @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the compressive stresses are given as @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "our compression simulations are performed in a stepwise manner in order to obtain numbers of equilibriums by a single simulation run .",
    "compression steps are given by two increment ratios @xmath73 and @xmath74 ; the initial compression from @xmath75 to @xmath76 is given as @xmath77 , and the @xmath78-th packing fraction as @xmath79 .",
    "the increment ratio @xmath74 is determined with the number of steps @xmath80 from @xmath81 to @xmath82 : @xmath83 .",
    "the strain - controlled compression is simply realized by translations of the walls with the velocity @xmath84 , so that the packing fraction increases continuously .",
    "when it reaches a target packing fraction @xmath85 , the translations of the walls are suspended to await the equilibrium .",
    "usually , the excess stress due to the quickness of the compression is relaxed by spreading the deformations into the entire system .",
    "the following criteria are examined every @xmath86 time steps of the simulation :    * the relative difference between the top and bottom stresses is smaller than a threshold value @xmath87 : @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the average , @xmath90 . * the relative change of the compressive stress for the last @xmath91 steps is smaller than a threshold value @xmath92 : @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the one of @xmath86 steps before .",
    "* no bonds were broken for the last @xmath86 steps .",
    "thus , the compressive stress @xmath95 balancing the network of packing fraction @xmath85 can be determined .",
    "once @xmath95 is determined , the compression continues again for the next target @xmath96 .      in order to reduce finite size effects",
    ", the simulation box needs to involve a sufficient number of typical structures .",
    "the compressive stress to balance sparse networks is very low , and the most of particles are slightly stressed . in this case , the relaxation time is significantly long . usually , the overdamped equations of motion , which are given by dropping the right hand sides of eqs .   due to the negligible inertia of particles , are used to simulate colloidal suspensions .",
    "however , we have taken a different approach for efficiency . as restricting our scope in the slow compression",
    ", we may be allowed to optimize some parameters for a faster simulation . in the slow compression limit ,",
    "velocities of particles are also slow . in this case",
    ", the contact forces dominate the displacements of particles .",
    "this is why a reduced viscosity @xmath97 still leads to the same equilibrium configurations with a shorter time .",
    "the following viscosity gives the critical damped motion in terms of the rolling mode .",
    "@xmath98 though it is not simple problem to find the best value , we used @xmath99 in the equation of motion .",
    "this arbitrary selection of the viscosity is justified only if the compression is considered slow enough .",
    "this point will be checked in sect .",
    "[ 141944_21nov12 ] .",
    "the introduced 2d contact model ( see sect .  [ 112400_22dec12 ] ) is relatively simple , but it still has 7 parameters to be given .",
    "traditional experimental measurements to characterize the particle - particle adhesion determine the pull - off force  @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath48 in this work . in recent years",
    "the atomic force microscope became a reliable method , which provides more precise data for normal force - displacement relationships  @xcite .",
    "however , there are fewer experimental measurements to determine the parameters of the other modes  @xcite .",
    "the experimental measurement of the three - point bending test by using optical tweezers is remarkable  @xcite , which provides parameters for the rolling mode , @xmath50 and @xmath100 ( or @xmath101 ) . in any case , all parameters for a single system have never been determined so far .",
    "thus our knowledge of the contact forces is still limited , so that we need to set the parameters by hand .",
    "but , we may have a certain level of confidence by reproducing a similar bending behavior with the three - point bending measurements .",
    "our selected parameters are intended to imitate the observed mechanical behavior : a small extent of elastic deformation and irreversible reorganization due to a critical moment .",
    "we have selected two sets of the parameters called bond 1 and bond 2 , which are shown in  [ bond_parameters ] .",
    "bond 1 has the same strengths for the three modes , while bond 2 is 5 times stronger for the normal and sliding mode than the rolling mode .",

    "the date shown in the previous section indicate that three distinct behaviors can be recognized in the compression process .",
    "let us discuss them one by one here .",
    "[ [ i - elastic - dominant - regime ] ] ( i ) elastic dominant regime + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    there is no percolation path in the 10 initial configurations of @xmath151 ( see  [ fig_snapshots ] ( a ) ) .",
    "hence , no compressive stress is required to compress them in the slow compression limit .",
    "after some compaction , the first spanning path appears , and the network begins to resist the compressive stress . at the gel point , a single - linking chain ( percolation path ) resists the external stress between top and bottom .",
    "this system - spanning cluster is deformed as a whole , so that strains of single bonds can be very small .",
    "therefore , the dominant response to the external stress is elastic deformation ; the work by compression is stored in the contact bonds  ( see  [ fig_contact_number_energy ]  ( b ) ) . in this range ,",
    "the power - law form expanding at the gel point @xmath152 is suitable to capture the @xmath2-@xmath4 curve  @xcite : @xmath153 in  [ fig_compression_curves ] , the dotted curve shows the fitting result with the function for the bond 1 simulation data of @xmath154 .",
    "the fitting gives the extrapolated gel point as @xmath155 .",
    "the evaluated exponent @xmath156 represents some nonlinearity .",
    "the compression induces some new contacts , so that the numbers of percolation paths are increased .",
    "the rise of resistance due to such increasing paths can be a plausible interpretation of the nonlinearity in this elastic - dominant regime .",
    "it must be noted that our simulation results in this range might have large statistical fluctuations .",
    "the typical length scale of the structure is comparable to the system size ( compare the drawn circle and the box size in  [ fig_snapshots ]  ( a ) ) , and consequently only a few paths enter the averaging .",
    "therefore , the gel point @xmath152 obtained in the above fitting has only limited significance .",
    "[ [ ii - single - mode - plastic - regime ] ] ( ii ) single - mode plastic regime + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    by considering two data (  [ fig_contact_number_energy ]  ( b ) and  [ bond_ruptures ] ) , we identified the single - mode plastic regime in the ranges : @xmath157 for bond 1 simulations and @xmath158 for bond 2 simulations .",
    "this @xmath4-dependence of the consolidation behavior has been discussed with a scaling concept  @xcite .",
    "the power - law relationships of @xmath2 and @xmath4 have been also observed in experiments  @xcite : @xmath159 a similar power - law behavior can be seen in our simulation results (  [ fig_compression_curves ] ) .",
    "the least squares fitting gives the almost same exponents : @xmath160 and @xmath161 , for the bond 1 and bond 2 results , respectively .",
    "let us look more closely at this regime .",
    "[ fig_snapshots ] ( b ) shows the configuration of particles at the beginning of this range ( @xmath162 ) in a bond 1 simulation . at the gel point ,",
    "a single linking path spanned the entire box .",
    "in contrast , multi - linking structures span the system here . since the maximum bending moment of a random - walk chain is proportional to the inverse of the chain size , the supportable loads of larger loops are smaller .",
    "the variety of the mesh sizes indicates a heterogeneity of the local strengths .",
    "though large empty spaces remain , the relatively dense meshes fill the space from the bottom to the top (  [ fig_snapshots ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "further compression requires destroying a part of them . as shown in  [ bond_ruptures ] , the rolling - mode ruptures are the only rupture events seen in this range .",
    "therefore , the size of the responsible mesh structures determines the compressive yield stress @xmath2 .",
    "thus , in the single - mode plastic regime , the length scale is essential ; the compression breaks larger and weaker structures into smaller and more robust structures .",
    "fractal model was employed to give the length scale from the packing fraction  @xcite ( see sect .  [ sec_structure_compression ] ) . according to the nature of a fractal ,",
    "a portion of a fractal cluster is also a small fractal cluster .",
    "if the compression of fractal networks causes only fragmentation of fractal clusters into smaller pieces , it can be expected that the correlation length is decreased while keeping the same fractal dimension .",
    "this optimistic expectation leads us to employ the fractal model for the compression problem .",
    "we will check this point in the next section .    , whose packing fraction is @xmath22 .",
    "the configurations ( b ) and ( c ) show the beginning of the _ single - mode plastic regime _ ( @xmath162 ) and the _ multi - mode plastic regime _ ( @xmath163 ) , respectively , and ( d ) shows @xmath164 .",
    "the red circles express the correlation lengths ; their diameters are @xmath165 , which will be evaluated in the later section ( sect .",
    "[ sec_structure_compression ] ) . ]",
    "[ [ iii - multi - mode - plastic - regime ] ] ( iii ) multi - mode plastic regime + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the onset of connection breaks indicates that the compression enters a new regime .",
    "this transition point depends on the parameters of the bonds .",
    "we consider the data above @xmath163 and @xmath166 in bond 1 and 2 simulations as the multi - mode plastic regime . in these ranges ,",
    "the compression curves look to follow a power law .",
    "however , the evaluated exponents are totally different with each other : @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "it is by chance that the exponent of bond 2 simulations is similar with the one in the single - mode plastic regime .",
    "the exponent in this regime is easily affected by the parameters of the contact model , that implies absence of a simple scaling law .",
    "[ fig_snapshots ] ( c ) depicts the beginning of this regime of a bond 1 simulation ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "there are still large loops remaining , but they look like voids due to the denser surroundings . here , we can easily find dense meshes and trimers ( a trimer can be considered as the building block of a close packing ) .",
    "if they are next to each other , the entire object can be considered as a lump .",
    "the same scenario of the _ single - mode plastic regime _ seems to work ; denser mesh domains are piled up over the entire system .",
    "however , due to the finite size of particles , the mechanical response of denser meshes is not the same as looser ones .",
    "the crush of them involves sliding ruptures and connection breaks , which are seen in  [ bond_ruptures ] .",
    "since the criteria of destruction includes the all three modes , the compression curve depends on the details of the contact force .",
    "this regime terminates due to the close packing , where rigidity of particles prevents reorganizations of particles . since",
    "our simplified contact model is not accurate for that , we can not specify the upper end of the range .      during compression",
    ", separated particles can newly come into contact .",
    "consequently , mesh size decreases as @xmath4 is increased by compression .",
    "if we employ the fractal model  @xcite to explain the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath2 , the structure change needs to follow a special manner ; the fractal dimension @xmath0 characterizing the local structures does not depend on the packing fraction @xmath4 , and the correlation length @xmath1 is a decreasing function of the packing fraction @xmath4 , @xmath169 .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath0 can be estimated from the density - density correlation function @xmath19 ( see  [ appendix_density - correlation ] ) .",
    "[ fig_ddc ] shows averages of the correlation functions @xmath19 of every second compression step , @xmath134 ( @xmath170 ) , of the bond 1 simulation results .",
    "the results of the bond 2 simulations were almost the same .",
    "the correlation of the density is mostly decreasing functions of the two - point distance @xmath171 .",

    "we introduce the fractal dimension profile @xmath175 from the local slope of the correlation function at each distance @xmath171 : @xmath176 the results are shown in  [ 143513_26nov12 ]  ( a ) . as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec_preparation_fractal_gel ] , the initial configurations ( solid line ) consist of three parts : a fractal plateau ( @xmath177 ) indicating @xmath178 , crossover range ( @xmath179 ) , and 2d - like uniform network ( @xmath180 ) .",

    "once the networks are compressed , the fractal correlations are affected immediately .",
    "indeed , the first compression step of our simulation ( @xmath182 ) shows the entire change of @xmath175 : a narrower plateau indicating a rise of the fractal dimension , and shifts of the crossover and uniform ranges to shorter lengths .",
    "these results suggest that not only long - distance correlations , but short - distance correlations can be affected by the compressive deformation at the early stage .",
    "this tendency continues for the further compression .",
    "though the profiles @xmath175 for the compressed networks indicate that mono - fractal assumption does not work , it may be worth determining the @xmath4 dependence of the correlation length @xmath1 .",
    "since the slopes of @xmath19 in  [ fig_ddc ] are not constant , it is ambiguous to determine @xmath1 from them . in our purpose",
    ", we may consider the correlation length as the length scale where the network looks uniform .",
    "the typical length scale for the uniformity can be determined by evaluating fluctuation of local densities  @xcite .",
    "the local densities are defined by boxes of size @xmath183 , which are denoted by @xmath184 .",
    "if the size of box is larger than the correlation length @xmath1 , the local densities show little fluctuation ; the system looks uniform .",
    "thus , the standard deviation of the local densities normalized by the global density , @xmath185 , measures the uniformity . due to the finite system size",
    ", we compare here the lengths showing a common finite fluctuation , @xmath186 .",
    "the actual values of the correlation lengths @xmath1 should be larger than the evaluated lengths @xmath187 , so a common arbitrary factor may be given to adjust .",
    "[ 143513_26nov12 ]  ( b ) shows the result of the lengths @xmath187 satisfying @xmath188 .",
    "we find a power - law relation between @xmath1 and @xmath4 with an exponent @xmath189 .",
    "the obtained exponent is a little bit smaller than the fractal assumption : @xmath190 .",
    "the evaluated correlation lengths , @xmath191 , are also shown as the diameter of the circles drawn in  [ fig_snapshots ] .",
    "we focused on investigating compression of particle gels . inspired by scaling theory for polymer gels ,",
    "the fractal model has been introduced to explain the packing fraction dependence of particle gels rheology  @xcite , and referred for the compression process  @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that the structure of a particle gel is fractal network .",
    "however , the simple question whether a particle gel under compression is fractal network or not , has left unanswered .",
    "we have aimed to answer this question by introducing a particle - scale simulation model in the limit of strongly aggregated particle gels . in this case , the cohesive force among contacting particles is assumed to be so strong that brownian forces do not affect the structural evolution of gels .",
    "our simulation reproduced the reasonable consolidation behaviors as @xmath4 _",
    "vs_.  @xmath2 relationships in the case of quasi - static compression . by",
    "monitoring various particle - scale information , i.e. , mean contact number , stored / dissipated energy , and number of bond ruptures , we identified the three distinct regimes : ( i ) elastic dominant regime , ( ii ) single - mode plastic regime , and ( iii ) multi - mode plastic regime . at the gel point , there are many `` dead end '' branches , where the particles in such branches do not contribute to the strength of the network @xmath2 .",
    "compression makes separated particles come into contact , so that the mesh size becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "this explanation is already known and qualitatively true for the most part .",
    "such shrinkage of the typical length scale causes a transition of the local mechanical response from ( ii ) to ( iii ) in the plastic regimes .",
    "while the length scale is large enough , the rolling mode is the responsible for the deformation . at a certain length scale ,",
    "the sliding and normal modes become more important for further compression .",
    "thus , we confirmed that a single regime could never cover the wide range of packing fractions in spite of subtle appearance in the @xmath4 _",
    "vs_.  @xmath2 relationships .",
    "the simulation results also provided an insight that heterogeneity in the local mesh sizes plays some roles in the way of reorganization under compression and overall network strength .",
    "mechanical correlations ( connectivity ) determine which parts of the network are destroyed under an applied stress .",
    "if a percolation path consisting of robust domains is built , they support a large fraction of the applied stress . in this case , the weakest domain in the path is most probable to be destroyed .",
    "this restructuring yields a smaller and robuster domain , which results in the reinforcement of the percolation path .",
    "however , such mechanism is subtle because compression is not continuing deformation and tends to reduce the heterogeneity .    in order to see whether the fractal assumption remains or not in particle gels under compression",
    ", we evaluated the density - density correlation @xmath19 for the simulation results .",
    "the evaluated fractal dimension profile @xmath175 says that compression affects both the local structure and correlation length in the early stage .",
    "thus , our results are contradictory to the application of the fractal model to compression processes .",
    "however , the fractal dimension profiles @xmath175 show a systematic change in the _ single - mode plastic regime_. this result seems to indicate required ingredients to upgrade the fractal model for compression processes .",
    "the simulation model of this work is simple ; we neglect various factors in real particle gels to make clear the focus of study and to optimize the simulation speed in order to achieve large system sizes . for example",
    ", we employed a simple contact model , which depends on only configuration of particles and has no history dependence",
    ". however , cohesion between particles in real system may be more complex , e.g. the bonding or breakup may require certain time periods . in order to deal with such systems ,",
    "our quasi - static simulation framework needs to be extended .",
    "this extension is relevant for the future work because there are many experimental works investigating on the time / rate - depending aspects of colloidal gels and yield stress fluids  @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank prof .",
    "morton denn for valuable suggestions on the manuscript , and rs would like to express his gratitude to prof .",
    "richard buscall for fruitful discussions , valuable suggestions , and warm encouragement .",
    "in order to study colloidal gels , we need to have some tools to characterize random structured systems .",
    "the density - density correlation function @xmath192 is used for this purpose .",
    "the local density function @xmath193 is defined as follows : @xmath194 by taking the average over the entire space of the system , the density - density correlation function @xmath192 is defined as follows : @xmath195 when the system is isotropic , the correlation is given in terms of the distance , @xmath196 , which can be obtained by taking averages over all directions : @xmath197 the correlation function @xmath19 can be regarded as a conditional probability to find particles .",
    "since it is normalized by the entire probability , the value 1 means no correlation .",
    "it is known that strongly aggregated gels have structures involving fractal correlations .",
    "the local structures are equivalent to fractal flocs . for fractal flocs , the relation between the number of particles @xmath198 and the radius of gyration @xmath199 follows a power - law : @xmath200 the exponent @xmath0 is called fractal dimension .",
    "therefore , the average packing - fraction profile of the clusters is given as follows : @xmath201 where @xmath171 is the distance from the center of mass . since",
    "fractal gels can be considered as cluster - filling networks , the local structure should coincide with this density profile .",
    "consequently , the density - density correlation function @xmath19 has the same functional form : @xmath202 . in a fractal gel ,",
    "the correlation reaches a finite distance , which is called the correlation length @xmath1 . for @xmath203",
