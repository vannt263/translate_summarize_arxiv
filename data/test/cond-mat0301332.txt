    "during the two decades following the work of ziff , gulari , and barshad ( zgb ) @xcite there has been a remarkable development in the theoretical analysis of catalytically activated reactions .",
    "the zgb model , sometimes referred to as the  monomer - dimer \" model , has been introduced to describe the important process of oxidation of carbon monoxide on a catalytic surface @xcite . within this model ,",
    "a monomer ( @xmath7 ) adsorbs onto a single vacant site of the surface ( since dissociation of @xmath7 is not considered , @xmath7 is treated as a monomer ) , while a dimer ( @xmath8 ) adsorbs onto a pair of adjacent @xmath9 sites and then immediately dissociates .",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are in thermal contact with their gaseous reservoirs .",
    "nearest neighbors of adsorbates composed of a dissociated @xmath10 atom and a @xmath7 molecule react and form a @xmath11 molecule , which then desorbs from the metal surface .",
    "the zgb model predicts remarkable new features compared to the classical mean - field kinetic schemes of rate equations @xcite : for a two - dimensional catalytic substrate as the @xmath7 gas pressure is lowered the system undergoes a first - order transition from a @xmath7 saturated inactive phase ( zero rate of @xmath11 production ) into a reactive steady state ( non - zero rate of @xmath11 production ) followed by a continuous transition into an @xmath8-saturated inactive phase .",
    "this continuous transition was shown to belong to the same universality class as the directed percolation and the reggeon field theory @xcite .",
    "a simpler  monomer - monomer \" model , in which particles of both species can adsorb on single but different sites , has also been proposed @xcite , and it has been shown that in ( 2 + 1 ) spatial dimensions this system exhibits a first - order transition from a phase saturated with one species to one saturated with the other . allowing desorption of one species leads to a continuous transition which also belongs to the directed percolation universality class @xcite .",
    "these observations have significantly increased the interest in the properties of such models of catalytically activated reactions .",
    "different aspects of the dynamics of the adsorbed phase for these two models , as well as for their extensions to molecules with more complicated structures ( e.g. , dimer - dimer @xcite , dimer - trimer @xcite models ) , have been examined thoroughly @xcite , and the studies have confirmed an essentially collective , many - particle behavior . on the other hand , the equilibrium properties of catalytically activated reactions in systems in which the reactive species undergo continuous exchanges with",
    "their vapor phases acting as reservoirs , i.e. , adsorb on and desorb from the catalytic substrate , have been much less studied , and , consequently , the understanding of the equilibrium state remains rather limited .",
    "only recently such equilibrium properties , revealing a rather non - trivial behavior , have been obtained for the more simple case of single - species reactions @xmath12 on a one - dimensional chain with a random distribution of catalytic segments or catalytic sites @xcite .",
    "kinetics of the diffusion - limited @xmath12 reactions , controlled by the constraint that the particles may undergo reactions only when they meet each other in the vicinity of special catalytic sites has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we study the properties of the equilibrium state for a very simple model of a monomer - monomer @xmath0 catalytic reaction on a one - dimensional chain . within this model",
    "the particles of species @xmath1 and @xmath2 undergo continuous exchanges with the mixed vapor phase , i.e. , they adsorb onto empty lattice sites on the chain and may thermally desorb from them , while the vapor phase as a reservoir is steadily maintained at constant chemical potentials .",
    "in addition , if any adsorbed @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles appear at neighboring lattice sites , they instantaneously react and both leave the chain ( i.e. , desorb ) , and the reaction product @xmath13 is completely removed from the system . for this model",
    "we derive the expression for the pressure of the adsorbed particles , which provides the complete thermodynamical description of the system , and we present exact asymptotic ( in respect to the chemical potential ) results for the mean densities of the particles and for the compressibilities of the system .",
    "we note that one could also consider a model in which the product @xmath13 is not removed from the system but is forming its own vapor phase from which it may readsorb on the substrate .",
    "however , this more complicated case will not be studied here .    in sec .",
    "2 we describe the model and introduce basic notations . in sect .",

    "5 we derive the expressions of the mean densities of the particles and of the compressibilities of the system , analyze their asymptotic behavior as function of the chemical potentials , and present results of monte carlo simulations for the occupation of the lattice in the limit of infinite chemical potentials .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) , which is brought in contact with the mixed vapor phase of two types @xmath1 and @xmath2 of hard - core particles without attractive interactions .",
    "the difference in chemical potential between the vapor phase and the adsorbed phase @xmath16 and @xmath17 , including the binding energy of an occupied site , is maintained constant ( thus @xmath18 corresponds to a preference for adsorption ) , and the constant activities are hence defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the thermal energy , @xmath21 is the temperature , and @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant .",

    "the results clearly show the formation of domains consisting of mainly @xmath1 or @xmath2 particles such that only a small number , eventually just two in the limit @xmath91 , of large domains emerges . intuitively , the emergence of two domains is due to the fact the in the limit @xmath190 the number of empty sites should be minimum since the ratio of the probability of a state with a greater number of empty sites and the probability of the state with minimum number of empty sites goes to zero as @xmath190 . here",

    "altough in this one - dimensional model there is no phase - transition , the system exhibits a rather non - trivial behavior .",
    "in particular , the mean density of the @xmath1 particles changes rapidly from very small values when the activity @xmath43 is larger than the activity @xmath42 to a state in which the lattice is occupied predominantly by @xmath1 particles when @xmath42 is larger than @xmath43 . in the case",
