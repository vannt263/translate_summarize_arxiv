    "ions in the neutron star crust can form a coulomb crystal which determines the crust s elastic properties .",
    "for example , the breaking stress @xmath2 is the maximum stress , as a function of strain , that the crust can support .",
    "if larger stress is applied to matter it will not remain in a static configuration .",
    "neutron star crust is under high pressure . as a result , voids or fractures",
    "do not occur ( @xcite ) and this simplifies how the crust breaks .",
    "the crust will break if the local stress is larger then the breaking stress at at least one point in the crust . in this paper",
    "we mostly refer to breaking stress ( force per unit area ) .",
    "the breaking strain ( corresponding value of the fractional deformation ) can be estimated from the linear stress - strain relation , where the slope is given by the well known elastic constant or shear modulus ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are a lot of models which associate breaking of neutron star crust with observational phenomena .",
    "first of all , crust breaking causes pulsar glitches in the starquake model of @xcite and in some recent models ( for brief review see @xcite ) .",
    "second , some models of magnetar giant flares involve crust breaking ( @xcite ) . here",
    "the crust may need to be very strong to control the release of large magnetic energies responsible for extremely energetic gamma ray bursts .",
    "indeed , our results , see below , predict that the crust is very strong .",
    "finally , the breaking stress limits the maximum size of `` mountains ''  on neutron stars .",
    "mountains , on rapidly rotating stars , can efficiently emit gravitational waves ( @xcite ) that could be detected by present large scale interferometers ( @xcite )",
    ". gravitational wave emission could be especially important for low mass neutron stars that can have large deformations ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover the balance of angular momentum gained from accretion , and radiated in gravitational waves , can control the spin period of some accreting stars ( @xcite ) .    for most terrestrial materials the durability ( time before breaking ) @xmath3 at a given stress is known to depend on the temperature and , of course , the applied stress ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "the breaking stress is not just a constant , defined by the matter parameters ( density , temperature and composition ) , but depends on the duration of the stress ",
    "the matter can break at lower stress , if one waits long enough .",
    "in fact , the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath3 is logarithmic and we will refer to @xmath3 as the timescale of the process .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to determine how @xmath2 , depends on @xmath3 and on temperature @xmath5 for neutron star crust .",
    "we suggest a simple expression [ see eq .",
    "( [ zhurkov_dimless ] ) parameterized by eq.([zhurfit ] ) below ] for the durability of neutron star crust material at a given stress .",
    "this expression gives the lifetime of elastic deformations ( mountains , for example ) and one can easily extract the breaking stress for the timescale of the process of interest ( a few years for pulsar glitches , for example ) .",
    "we also note the possible application of our results to the physics of dusty plasmas .",
    "such a plasma can form a yukawa crystal , just like the ions in neutron star crust .",
    "its breaking stress can be measured in the laboratory as a threshold stress which is needed to obtain flow .",
    "the presence of such a threshold has been recently experimentally demonstrated by @xcite .    until recently breaking stress studies ( @xcite ) have been based on analogies with terrestrial materials instead of accurate calculations , and the uncertainties",
    "were large .",
    "recently , large scale molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the breaking stress were performed ( @xcite ) .",
    "the breaking strain was found to be large @xmath6 and only slightly affected by impurities , defects , and polycrystalline structure ( grain boundaries ) . in the present paper , we extend these results with extensive md simulations of breaking stress at different temperatures and strain rates .",
    "we use these results to extract parameters of the zhurkov model of strength [ see sec .  [",
    "sec : zhurkov ] and @xcite for details ] and apply this model to estimate the breaking stress for timescales of 1 s  1 year , which are of most interest for applications , but much longer than possible for direct md simulations .",

    "the inner crust also contains free neutrons ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the electrons are degenerate and form a slightly polarizing background which screens the coulomb interaction between ions .",

    "the ratio of plasma temperature @xmath27 to the temperature @xmath5 characterizes the importance of quantum effects on ion motion . in our classical md simulations we neglect quantum effects ( assuming @xmath28 ) , but they can be important at the conditions of realistic neutron star crust and we discuss them in sec.[sec : zeropoint ] .      to calculate the breaking stress we developed a parallel version of the yukawamd code ( @xcite ) where the ion system is strained by deforming periodic boundaries .",
    "we use the velocity verlet algorithm ( @xcite ) with a time step @xmath29 .",
    "the simulations are performed as follows : the original system is taken to be a perfect body centered cubic crystal contained in a cubic box , that is aligned with the lattice planes .",
