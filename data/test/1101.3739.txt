    "the interest in the storage and manipulation of quantum systems have led the researchers to design strategies for preserving the coherence of such systems against the detrimental effects of the environment  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the uncontrollable degrees of freedom of the environment can get entangled with the quantum system and rapidly destroy the relative phase between the components of a linear superposition state .",
    "considerable efforts have been devoted to the issue of counteracting decoherence .",
    "notable examples are quantum error - correction codes ( qecc )  @xcite and decoherence - free subspaces ( dfs )  @xcite , both based on the careful encoding of the quantum state to be protected into a wider , partially redundant , hilbert space ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bb_control_loops ] ) .",
    "the drawback of these encoding strategies is the large amount of extra resources required  @xcite .",
    "alternative approaches which avoid this hindrance have been developed and may be divided into two main categories : closed - loop control , also known as quantum feedback  @xcite , and open - loop control  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bb_control_loops ] ) .",
    "in closed - loop techniques , the system to be protected is subject to appropriate measurements , whose results are then used for a real - time correction of the system dynamics . on the contrary , in open - loop controls ,",
    "the system is subject to external , suitably tailored , time - dependent pulses which do not require any measurement .",
    "the control operations are chosen so that any undesired effect of the environment , such as dissipation , decoherence , heating , can be eliminated in principle if the controls are applied faster than the environment correlation time . the physical idea behind these open - loop schemes comes from refocusing techniques in nmr spectroscopy  @xcite where they are typically implemented via strong and rapid pulses known as `` bang - bang '' ( bb ) controls .",
    "open - loop decoupling strategies have been suggested in various physical contexts : to inhibit the decay of an unstable atomic state @xcite , to suppress the magnetic state decoherence  @xcite and the heating in ion traps  @xcite , to contrast the quantum noise due to scattering processes  @xcite and the polarization mode dispersion  @xcite in optical fibers .",
    "bb control has been first demonstrated in nmr systems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "then , it has been proven with nuclear spin qubits in fullerene  @xcite , nuclear - quadrupole qubits  @xcite and very recently also with electron spins in penning traps  @xcite and polarization qubits in a plane - parallel cavity  @xcite   and in a ring cavity  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the last of the above - mentioned applications  @xcite and provide an analytical explanation of the results .",
    "photons interact very weakly with their environment and encoding quantum information in their polarization is a practical and convenient solution for many quantum communication protocols  @xcite .",
    "however , the optical properties of elements like mirrors , crystals and waveplates always depend upon both polarization and frequency , realizing in this way an effective coupling between the two degrees of freedom of the photon .",
    "the detection of the final polarization state is then performed by a detector that inevitably has a nonzero integration time .",
    "hence the measurement traces out the frequency degree of freedom and if the field is not monochromatic all the information transferred to the frequency modes goes lost , inducing on the polarization qubit a dephasing process analogous to the `` transversal '' decay occurring in nmr .",
    "such a polarization decoherence can be inhibited by means of bb controls implemented in space , i.e. , along the photon path , rather than in time , by means of suitably oriented waveplates . in ref .",
    "@xcite this idea is applied to the evolution of an optical pulse circling in a triangular ring cavity .",
    "polarization decoherence occurs because of the reflection of the pulse on the cavity mirrors , which depend on both frequency and polarization .",
    "after a few cavity round trips , the initially pure polarization state becomes highly mixed . on the contrary , after inserting appropriate waveplates in the cavity realizing an effective impulsive bb , polarization decoherence is significantly inhibited .",
    "previously , a proof - of - principle of the bb impulsive dynamics was given in  @xcite , by using optical pulses in a plane - parallel cavity .",
    "that experiment clearly demonstrates that bb can be applied to light pulses traveling back - and - forth between two points in space , e.g. , on a two - way optical channel  @xcite . on the other hand , the present experiment including a ring cavity extends the applicability of bb to one - way channels , because it eliminates the need of a recycling mirror for suppressing decoherence , and relies entirely on bb impulsive controls .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present a brief introduction on the dynamical decoupling . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the experimental apparatus of ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , the preparation of the input polarization state , the triangular ring cavity within which it propagates , and its final detection .",
    "we show how polarization decoherence emerges due to the polarization dispersive properties of the cavity mirrors .",
    "we also introduce the `` compensated '' cavity obtained by placing an additional @xmath0 waveplate in the long arm of the cavity ; this is needed if we require that the cavity induces a purely decohering dynamics on the pulse polarization . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss a first experiment in which polarization decoherence is inhibited through the simple `` carr - purcell '' decoupling scheme  @xcite , which is a particular case of bb control realized by adding a single wave - plate within the cavity , suitably oriented .",
    "we then consider the more general pauli - group decoupling  @xcite , which is realized by employing _",
    "two _ waveplates with orthogonal rotation axes and we show that polarization decoherence is inhibited also in this case .",
    "finally we modify our ring cavity setup in order to implement the most general form of decoherence acting on the polarization qubit .",
    "generic qubit decoherence is realized by placing a soleil  babinet ( sb ) compensator with axis at 45@xmath1 with respect to the cavity plane in front of each plane mirror .",
    "we show that , in accordance with theoretical predictions  @xcite , pauli - group decoupling is effective in inhibiting decoherence in this general case too .",
    "v is for concluding remarks .",
    "the open - loop control technique takes advantage of the finite time of the relaxation process induced by the environment on the system . accordingly , one is able to modify the dynamics by inducing motions on the system faster than the shortest time scale accessible by the environment .",
    "for instance , to improve the resolution in nmr spectroscopy , multiple fast pulse sequences are used in order to reverse the effect of interactions of spins with the environment  @xcite .",
    "this is obtained through a careful tailoring of the amplitude , phase , and frequency of the time - dependent terms in the total hamiltonian .",
    "the main example is the `` spin echo '' refocussing technique used in nmr , extensively investigated by e.  l.  hahn  @xcite , and later generalized by carr and purcell  @xcite . in that case ,",
    "the main sources of noise are the inhomogeneities in the magnetic field and the molecular spin - spin interactions , which cause the total magnetization to dephase in a typical relaxation time called @xmath2 . at the microscopic level , the dephasing is due to the slightly different larmor frequency experienced by each spin in the ensemble . in a reference frame which rotates about the @xmath3-axis at the larmor frequency",
    ", the @xmath2 process can be visualized as the spreading of the magnetization vector in the transverse plane .",
    "one can then apply suitable rf pulses at the larmor frequency to flip each spin by an angle of @xmath4 .",
    "this realizes an effective `` time reversal '' for the molecules of the sample and leads , in the ideal case , to the rephasing of the magnetization vector .",
    "this is analogous to what happens in a standard optical fiber because of the chromatic dispersion .",
    "when a light pulse travels in the fiber , all its components experience a different local birefringence , so they propagate at different velocities and the initial packet broadens . when a second fiber of opposite - sign dispersion is matched with the first one , a time - reversal of the frequency components occurs and the chromatic dispersion cancels out .",
    "a general description of an open quantum system dynamical decoupling through open - loop control was given by viola _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite . assuming a quantum system , @xmath5 , described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 , plunged in an environment described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 , the total hamiltonian is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the coupling between system and environment .",
    "the open - system properties like , e.g. , the decoherence time , can be modified by adding to the system hamiltonian a time - varying cyclic control , @xmath10 , with a period @xmath11 such that @xmath12 in this way the resulting dynamics of the quantum system , usually called `` stroboscopic dynamics '' , is described by an effective hamiltonian @xmath13 .",
    "if the period @xmath11 is sufficiently shorter than the memory time of the environment , @xmath14 , the effective hamiltonian can be represented by the lowest - order average hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath15\\,.\\ ] ] corrections at higher orders in @xmath11 can be systematically evaluated .    the simplest way of realizing a quantum system dynamical decoupling is through the quantum bb control , which operates by repeatedly applying instantaneous , arbitrarily strong , control pulses ( `` kicks '' ) to a qubit , thus disrupting the environmental interaction .",
    "this allows to convert the average over the cycle into a group - theoreric average , where a discrete set of unitary control operations , @xmath16 , acting on the quantum system only , are introduced  @xcite : @xmath17 intuitively the bb symmetrizes the evolution with respect to the group @xmath18 , and the system is perfectly decoupled from the environment when the interaction with the environment is symmetrized to zero .    .",
    "]    fig.[fig : bb_decouplinggroup ] provides a graphical representation of the bb idea .",
    "the quantum system enters from the left side and repeatedly undergoes the periodic transformations @xmath19@xmath20 . after each complete cycle in the group @xmath18 ,",
    "the properties of the quantum system are restored to their initial value ( up to corrections at the second order and higher in @xmath21 ) .",
    "this allows , in principle , to indefinitely decouple the system from the environment .    at this point",
    "it is straightforward to figure out how the bb control can be adapted to the optical domain .",
    "a light pulse travels in a free - space portion of space or in an optical fiber and passes through a series of passive optical elements like waveplates or phase - shifters , disposed at regular intervals along the channel , in analogy to the schematics of fig.[fig : bb_decouplinggroup ] .",
    "given the small thickness of the optical elements , the time employed by the light to pass through them is extremely small and well approximates the bb condition of instantaneous interaction .      in ref .",
    "@xcite it is showed how to inhibit decoherence through the application of shaped time - varying controls designed to be equivalent to the application of the parity operator on the system .",
    "the decoupling is realized by a sequence of very frequent `` parity kicks '' ( pk ) of duration @xmath22 after a free evolution of duration @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "assuming that the external pulse is so strong that it is possible to neglect the free evolution during the pulse @xmath22 , and that the pulse hamiltonian @xmath25 and the pulse width @xmath22 can be chosen to satisfy the pk condition @xmath26 the stroboscopic dynamics of the system inhibits decoherence whenever the following general conditions hold : @xmath27 this means that the system hamiltonian is parity invariant and the interaction with the external environment anticommutes with the system parity operator .",
    "decoupling is then obtained through symmetrization with respect to the group @xmath28 so that @xmath29 .",
    "a harmonic oscillator with linear dissipation @xmath30 satisfies such conditions , and the bb control is obtained by shifting the oscillation frequency @xmath31 of @xmath32 during the time @xmath22 , under the constraint @xmath33 , for which @xmath34 : @xmath35 pk control has a strong relationship with the spin - echo technique , because in both cases the applied pulses realize a time reversal of the unwanted hamiltonian interaction and cancel its effect .",
    "we consider now a particular system - environment interaction in which the decoherence occurs along a preferred axis , e.g. , along @xmath3 . in the standard spin - boson model",
    "this is described by the following interaction hamiltonian : @xmath37 such an interaction can describe the above - mentioned pure dephasing process related to @xmath2 in nmr  @xcite , when the magnetic field is aligned in the @xmath3 direction , or the birefringence experienced by a light pulse traveling in a polarization - maintaining ( pm ) optical fiber with the fast axis parallel to the @xmath3 direction .",
    "the `` fast '' and `` slow '' axes are the pm fiber eigenmodes .",
    "the pulses linearly polarized along the fast axis have a group velocity higher than those polarized along the slow axis .",
    "this implies that a pulse which is not polarized along one of these directions is split in two separate time bins with orthogonal polarizations .",
    "such an effect must not be confused with the polarization - mode dispersion ( pmd ) of a single - mode ( sm ) optical fiber , which is mainly related to a non - perfect symmetry of the fiber core .",
    "it is possible to use bb controls to reduce the decoherence induced by the interaction hamiltonian of eq.[eq : carr - purcell_interaction ] .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite a dynamical bb decoupling is realized by the repetition of only two steps : i ) the free evolution of the system for an interval @xmath23 represented by the unitary @xmath38 ; ii ) the flip of the qubit around the @xmath39-axis through the operator @xmath40 .",
    "after two repetitions of these basic steps the system dynamics is driven by the following sequence of operators : @xmath41 where the first equality comes from the relation @xmath42 and where @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the above sequence @xmath45 defines a particular case of dynamical decoupling called `` carr  purcell decoupling '' ( cp ) . when the interaction term is like in eq .",
    ", i.e. , when there is a preferred basis for decoherence to occur ( the `` pointer basis ''  @xcite ) then the cp alone is sufficient to decouple the system from the environment .",
    "more generally , the cp works perfectly when the noise acts along any axis orthogonal to the direction of the flip .",
    "intuitively the spin - flip put forward by the @xmath46 operation changes the sign of the interaction hamiltonian , eq .",
    ", which is then symmetrized with respect to the group @xmath47 this averages out the detrimental influence of the environment .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the cp decoupling can be easily applied to pm fibers .",
    "it suffices to connect two pm fibers of equal length in a cross configuration , so that the fast axis of the first fiber is aligned to the slow axis of the second .",
    "the cross - connector executes an operation analogous to the @xmath40-flip just described , thus removing the difference in the group velocities due to the fiber birefringence .      in the spin - boson model the most general interaction of a qubit with its environment is given by @xmath48 decoherence acts along the axis parallel to the effective magnetic field @xmath49 , which is however generally unknown .",
    "therefore the simple cp - sequence is no more effective .",
    "nonetheless decoupling can still be obtained through symmetrization with respect to the complete _ pauli group _ pg : @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "this can be implemented using only two spin - flips around two orthogonal axes , @xmath46 and @xmath53 , because , apart an overall phase , we can write : @xmath54 with pg is possible to decouple the system from the environment , whatever the direction of the interaction hamiltonian , up to the first order in @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "however it is worth to notice that more general decoupling schemes are possible which achieve decoupling at higher orders in @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : bb_decouplingexamples ] summarizes the open - loop decoupling techniques described so far , in the bb approximation of instantaneous control pulses .",
    "the inset ( a ) and ( b ) of the figure contain the schematics of pk and cp decoupling techniques respectively ; their use in the optical domain has already been discussed .",
    "the inset ( c ) represents the most general decoupling scheme , the pg .",
    "it becomes particularly important when the preferred axis of the system - environment interaction is unknown , e.g. , in an sm optical fiber .",
    "in fact , it is possible to segment an sm fiber into smaller and smaller portions until a unity of length @xmath56 is reached which features a constant birefringence ( along unknown axes ) and so constant dispersive properties . regardless of the direction of the birefringence , pg decoupling can be applied on a length scale comparable to @xmath56 to suppress decoherence on each segment of the sm fiber and , by consequence , on the fiber as a whole .",
    "all of the described decoupling scheme , in particular the pg , are suitable for a straightforward application in the optical domain .",
    "photons are ideal carriers of quantum information as they allow a fast transfer of information while interacting weakly with the surroundings .",
    "however in the practice photons are replaced by light pulses which are intrinsically non - monochromatic and are measured by detectors which do not possess an infinite integration time .",
    "hence , a vast part of the information committed to the frequency degree of freedom is traced out by the final measuring process , which is not able to discriminate each frequency component of the light pulse .",
    "a solution to this problem is to encode information in the polarization degree of freedom .",
    "however , when the light propagates in a dispersive medium , such as an optical fiber , the initial information can spread out to other unwanted degrees of freedom , like frequency , and again that information will go lost .",
    "so in this case the frequency degree of freedom acts as the environment of the polarization qubit and induces a dephasing process on it .",
    "this happens because the dispersive medium couples the two degrees of freedom with an interaction hamiltonian like the following : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the frequency - dependent refractive index of the medium and @xmath59 are the generators of the polarization - qubit evolution .",
    "the above hamiltonian descends from the fourier transform of the one describing a light pulse propagating in an inhomogeneous medium , i.e. with an index of refraction that depends on the position of the pulse .",
    "so it is closely related to the above - mentioned pmd occurring in sm optical fibers .",
    "the similarity with eq .",
    "is apparent ; this means that pg can be employed to adverse the polarization decoherence due to pmd . in a classical communication scenario pmd",
    "adversely affect the rate of long distance communications  @xcite .",
    "pmd is also substantial in a fiber - based quantum communication if one uses a qubit realized in polarization since the unavoidable coupling with the birefringent environment affect the purity and fidelity of transmitted qubits  @xcite    there are not many techniques to combat the pmd detrimental effects .",
    "one is of course to adopt a pm fiber , but it works only for the two linear polarizations aligned to the fiber eigenmodes . another technological solution is to spin the sm fiber so to distribute inhomogeneities symmetrically in the core  @xcite ; however this increases the fiber attenuation more than 20 times for wavelengths in the third telecom window . finally , one solution is based on faraday mirrors  @xcite .",
    "the principle is that of `` retracing beam '' : a light pulse travels back and forth along the communication channel ; this leads it to compensate during the backward travel all the pmd encountered in the forward travel .",
    "the only assumption in this case is that the pmd remains constant during the two trips of the pulse  @xcite .",
    "this technique is clearly not applicable to all those channels where the information carriers travel in the forward direction only .    given the lack of conclusive solutions to adverse the pmd on one - way communication channels , it is quite surprising that bb dynamical decoupling has not been already applied to the optical domain .",
    "in fact specific experiments on this subject are missing .",
    "the remarkable experiments reported in  @xcite can not be deemed an exception in this respect , since they partly rely on the principle of retracing beam ; so their application appears to be more suitable for two - way communication channels . in the following we focus on the recent demonstration given in  @xcite and",
    "show the effectiveness of the bb dynamical decoupling for suppressing the decoherence of a polarization qubit confined in a _ ring cavity_. the choice of a ring cavity has a twofold motivation : on one side it realizes the hamiltonian of eq . , which well mimic the effect of pmd in a dispersive medium .",
    "the second reason is that a ring cavity represents the perfect simulation of a one - way channel : the principle of retracing beam is removed as its root because errors tend to accumulate rather than to cancel out .",
    "the experimental apparatus of ref.@xcite is depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : bb_setup_onlycavity ] .",
    "a laser diode with central wavelength at @xmath60  nm and bandwidth @xmath61  nm is pulsed at repetition rate of 100  khz and pulse duration @xmath62100  ps . the laser is attenuated and injected in a triangular ring cavity through a spherical mirror .    ) and a quarter - waveplate ( @xmath63 ) .",
