    "of the various types of supernovae ( sne ) we observe , only certain subtypes of type ii sne have been conclusively connected to their progenitors .",
    "pre - explosion imaging has shown that sne ii - plateau ( sne  iip ) , for example , come from red supergiants ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "owing to their cosmological significance , the progenitor systems of sne ia have been pursued relentlessly over the last two decades , but their nature is still debated ( see for a recent review ) .",
    "sne ii and stripped - envelope sne ( se sne ; i.e. , sne  iib , ib , ic , and broad - lined ic ; e.g. , ) are attributed to the core collapse ( cc ) of stars more massive than @xmath0 .",
    "spectroscopically , se sne are distinguished from sne ii by the lack of hydrogen features ( either partial , as in sne iib , or nearly complete , as in sne ib ; e.g. , ) .",
    "sne ic also lack helium features . in order to explain this lack of hydrogen and helium , se  sne",
    "are thought to be the explosions of stars that have had their outer envelopes stripped away before the explosion ( hence their name ) .",
    "of all the processes suggested to explain this stripping , the leading models make use of either stellar winds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , interaction with a binary companion ( e.g. , ) , or a combination of both ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of broad - lined sne",
    "ic connected to gamma - ray bursts , chemically homogeneous evolution ( e.g. , ) and explosive common - envelope ejection @xcite have also been suggested .",
    "pre - explosion imaging of the sites of these sne has so far failed to reveal the nature of their progenitors conclusively ( e.g. , @xcite ) , though the case for yellow super - giants in binary systems as the progenitors of sne iib is gaining traction ( e.g. , ) .",
    "new observational methods are required to address this question .",
    "sne ia are thought to be thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white - dwarf remnants of @xmath1  @xmath2 stars . in order to disrupt the otherwise stable white dwarf",
    ", most models place it in a binary system where it can grow in mass , raising the temperature in the core until the carbon is ignited in a thermonuclear runaway . to grow in mass , the white dwarf can either siphon matter off of a main - sequence or evolved companion star ( the so - called `` single - degenerate '' scenario ; @xcite ) or merge with a second carbon - oxygen white dwarf after the two spiral in owing to loss of energy and angular momentum to gravitational waves ( the `` double degenerate '' scenario ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , direct collisions of white dwarfs have also been suggested as a possible progenitor channel ( e.g. , @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "many methods have been used to constrain these various sn progenitor models , including ( but far from limited to ) direct imaging of the explosion sites either before or long after the sn explosion ( e.g. , @xcite ) , multiwavelength follow - up observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and analyses of sn remnants ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on correlations between sn rates and various galaxy properties and what those correlations can tell us about sn progenitors .",
    "@xcite showed that sn ia rates per unit mass decreased with increasing galaxy stellar mass .",
    "* hereafter l11 ) showed the same effect for all sn types , in all types of galaxies ( but see section  [ sec : snia ] ) , and dubbed this the `` rate - size , '' or rate - mass , relation .",
    "we confirmed this trend for sne  ia in star - forming galaxies in @xcite and for sne  ii in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g15 ) .",
    "following @xcite , we showed that the dependence of the sn ia rates on stellar mass results from a combination of galaxy scaling relations ( older galaxies are more massive , on average , than younger ones ; @xcite ) and the sn ia delay - time distribution ( dtd ) , which behaves as a power law with an index of @xmath3 ( e.g. , observations by @xcite ; and reviews by ) .",
    ", @xcite , @xcite , and g15 also measured sn ia rates as a function of the galaxies specific star - formation rate ( ssfr ) .",
    "in g15 , we showed that our explanation for the rate - mass correlation also explained the observed trend between sn ia rates and ssfr , where the rates are constant in passive galaxies but rise with increasing ssfr in star - forming galaxies .    in g15 , we also measured sn rates as a function of stellar mass and ssfr for sne ii and claimed that their rate - mass relation was simply the result of their progenitors short lifetimes : because sne ii come from massive ( @xmath4 ) stars , their rates track the star - formation rates of their galaxies .",
    "similar measurements of cc sn rates ( i.e. , combining sne ii and se sne ) were made by @xcite .",
    "l11 was part of a series of papers that explored the sn sample collected by the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ; l11 ; @xcite ) .",
    "loss is an ongoing survey for sne in local galaxies using the 0.76-m katzman automatic imaging telescope . for detailed descriptions of the survey ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    here",
    ", we use the loss sample to remeasure and re - analyze the sn rates originally published by l11 . in section  [ sec : galaxies ] , we match between the loss sample and spectroscopy from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) in order to go beyond l11 and measure the sn rates not only as a function of galaxy stellar mass but also of ssfr and metallicity , as expressed by the abundance of gas - phase oxygen in the centers of the loss galaxies .    in section  [ sec : addendum ] , we make several addendums to the loss sample .",
    "we publish the control times necessary to measure sn rates with this sample , as well as updated galaxy - property tables and sn rates .",
    "we deal with sne ia in section  [ sec : snia ] , and with cc sne in section  [ sec : ccsn ] .",
    "we find significant correlations between the sn rates and the various galaxy properties .",
    "most importantly , we find that the cc sn rates behave differently in different types of galaxies : the se sn rates are shown to be deficient , relative to the sn ii rates , in galaxies with low stellar mass , high ssfrs , and low metallicity values .",
    "other studies have reported similar trends through measurements of correlations between fractions of sne within a given sample and metallicity ( e.g. , ) , or by splitting sn fractions between different types of galaxies , which encompass different metallicity regimes @xcite .",
    "we conduct an in - depth comparison of our results with these works in section  [ subsec : ccsn_context ] .",
    "in section  [ sec : discuss ] , we discuss how the various rate correlations are not independent . for all sn types , a correlation with one galaxy property",
    "can be transformed into the measured correlations with any other galaxy property by using well - known galaxy scaling relations .",
    "this makes it impossible to distinguish causation from correlation , especially for the deficiency of se sne in lower - mass galaxies .",
    "however , we argue that the structure seen in the correlations ( e.g. , the way the ratio between the se sn and sn ii rates depends on galaxy stellar mass ) can be used to constrain progenitor models .",
    "paper ii in this series will use population fractions , as measured from the loss volume - limited subsample of sne , to strengthen the results presented here and add further constraints on sn progenitor scenarios . for paper ii , we rely on a reclassification of the sne in this subsample , as reported by shivvers et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "between march 1998 and december 2008 , loss discovered a total of 1,036 sne .",
    "most of these were discovered among the 14,882 galaxies directly targeted by the search ( at a median distance of @xmath5 mpc , where the upper and lower bounds contain 68% of the galaxies in the sample ) , but a few dozen were also discovered in background galaxies in the loss fields .",
    "this sample , along with the subsamples used to measure the loss sn luminosity functions @xcite and rates ( l11 ) , are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "loss classified their sne into three broad categories ( e.g. , ): sne ia , ib / c , and ii .",
    "the first category included all sn  ia subtypes , including the subluminous sn 1991bg - like sne , overluminous sn 1991t - like sne , and sn 2002cx - like sne  ia ( now referred to as sne iax ; @xcite ) .",
    "sne ib / c included sne ib , ic , and `` peculiar '' se sne ( such as broad - lined sne ic ; see , e.g. , for a review ) . the final category comprised sne iip , iil , iin , and iib .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , sne iib are characterized by hydrogen deficiency , which is an indication of envelope stripping .",
    "thus , they should be grouped with the sne ib / c ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "we use `` se sne '' instead of `` sne ib / c . ''",
    "however , because we use the control times calculated by l11 for the loss sample ( see sections  [ sec : addendum ] and [ subsec : rates_mass ] , below ) , we must keep the sne iib grouped with the sn ii class when calculating rates .",
    "fourteen sne had no spectroscopic classification .",
    "@xcite divided these sne into the three sn categories `` according to the statistics of the sne having spectroscopic classification '' and used them in the l11 rate calculations .",
    "we choose to exclude these sne from the rate measurements performed in this work .",
    "@xcite divided the loss galaxies into eight hubble types  e , s0 , sa , sb , sbc , sc , scd , and irr ( irregular )  according to their designations in the nasa extragalactic database .",
    "we keep these designations in the current work .",
    "we divide the complete loss galaxy sample into several subsamples , which we label the `` loss , '' `` ssfr , '' and `` metallicity '' samples .",
    "the loss sample is similar to the sample used by l11 to measure the original loss sn rates ( i.e. , the `` full - optimal '' subsample ; 10,121 galaxies from the targeted list only , i.e. , excluding sne discovered in background galaxies ) and is used here to measure sn rates per unit mass ( `` specific '' rates ) as a function of galaxy stellar mass .",
    "the ssfr sample comprises 2,415 galaxies targeted by loss that had spectra acquired by the sdss and were analyzed by both the mpa - jhu galspec pipeline @xcite and the nasa - sloan atlas ( nsa ) , which is based on the sdss dr8 spectroscopic catalog @xcite .",
    "this sample is used to correlate the sn rates with ssfr .",
    "the `` metallicity '' sample is a subset of 1,000 galaxies from the mpa - jhu galspec catalog , which we use to measure specific sn rates as a function of the central oxygen abundances of the galaxies .",
    "we detail the selection criteria for each of the subsamples in appendix  [ appendix : samples ] . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : consistency ] , we show that the rates measured with each sample are mutually consistent .",
    "the numbers of galaxies and sne in each subsample are summarized in table  [ table : sample_general ] and the properties of the galaxies in the entire loss sample are given in table  [ table : gal_prop ] .",
    "cc   &   +    before delving into correlations between sn rates and galaxy properties , we use this section to present several updates and extensions to the original loss papers .",
    "figures 3 and 4 of l11 show measurements of specific sn rates as a function of galaxy stellar mass in galaxies of different hubble types .",
    "however , in these figures , the rates for each type are scaled to match the rates as measured in sbc galaxies .",
    "this means that the scatter of the rates in different galaxy types is not visible in the figures ( though it can be reconstructed to some degree from the parameters of the fits to the original , unscaled measurements , which appear in table 4 of l11 ) , and the rate - mass correlation appears tighter than it really is . in figure",
    "[ fig : rates_all ] , we show similar measurements , but do not scale them , so that their spread is apparent . in the sn ii rates , where the scatter is largest , there is a clear progression from late - type ( i.e. , younger and less massive ) galaxies , where the rates are highest , to early - type ( older , more massive ) galaxies . in the se sn and sn ia rates , where the scatter is smaller , this trend is not as clear .",
    "we publish our newly calculated loss rates in table  [ table : rates ] .",
    "l11 fit power laws to their rates and published the fits in their table 4 .",
    "they did not , however , publish the measurements themselves .",
    "our rates are not identical to those measured by l11 , as we use the entire full - optimal subset of galaxies , after filling in missing masses ( see appendix  [ appendix : samples ] ) , but leave out the 14 sne without spectroscopic classifications ( see section  [ sec : galaxies ] , above ) . however , the differences between the loss sample used here and the one used by l11 are minor and have little effect on the resultant rates .    l11 divided their sne into bins so that each rate bin contained roughly the same number of sne ( `` sn - fixed '' bins ) .",
    "this is a common practice in studies where the sn sample sizes are either small to begin with , or reduced owing to binning ( in this case , by binning the host galaxies according to hubble type ) ; we will follow this binning scheme in the following sections .",
    "once the sample size is increased , though , other binning schemes become available , such as using bins of constant stellar mass ( `` mass - fixed '' bins ) .",
    "it then becomes necessary to formulate an objective , data - driven method to determine the binning scheme that will extract the most information out of the sample .",
    "to better trace the correlation between the sn rates and stellar mass , we use a sliding mass bin of constant width .",
    "the size of this bin depends on the size of the sn sample and is determined by knuth s rule @xcite , with the added constraint that the bin width not exceed 1 dex of @xmath2 . in each iteration ,",
    "the bin either gains or loses the nearest sn to its current borders , such that in some iterations , losing one sn on one end may lead to a gain of several sne on the other . in each bin @xmath6 , the specific sn rate , @xmath7 ,",
    "is measured according to @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of sne in the bin , @xmath10 is the stellar mass of the @xmath11-th galaxy in the bin , and @xmath12 is the control ( or visibility ) time of the @xmath11-th galaxy  i.e . , the time during which a given sn type could have been detected by loss during the survey .",
    "these control times take into account the detection efficiency of the survey , as well as our broad knowledge of sn characteristics ( i.e. , light curve shapes and luminosity functions ) .",
    "we use the original loss control times as computed by l11 ( see also @xcite and @xcite ; see section  [ subsec : rates_mass ] for a discussion of how the inclusion of sne iib in the sn ii control times may affect the rates measured here).these control times were not included in tables 2 and 4 of @xcite , which laid out most of the properties of the loss galaxy and sn samples . in order for our work to be reproducible , and for others to continue to explore the loss sample , we publish the control times in table  [ table : sample_general ] .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : rates_all ] , the sliding - bin rates diverge wildly at the edges of the mass range in each panel . as the number of galaxies that go into the denominator in equation  [ eq : rate ] grows smaller ( as shown in the stellar mass histograms in the bottom panels ) , and the number of sne decreases , the poisson noise dominates , and the rate eventually diverges .",
    "this problem also affects rates measured with sn - fixed or mass - fixed bins ( as shown in figure  [ fig : all_samples ] ) , but is usually not as apparent .",
    "the sliding - bin rates are useful for visual recognition of possibly interesting features , such as the break and rate ratio discussed in section  [ subsec : rates_mass ] , below .",
    "however , they are not independent measurements and so can not be used for curve fitting .",
    "thus , throughout this work , we use sn - fixed bins for fitting purposes .",
    "the number of bins for each fit is chosen to maximize the number of sne in each bin while also revealing as much structure in the rates .",
    "we repeat each fit with a different number of bins to make sure that the results do not change appreciably .",
    "all rates in this paper are presented in units of @xmath13 , which are abbreviated to `` snum '' ( i.e. , sn rate per unit mass ) . in all the sn rate figures presented here ,",
    "vertical error bars are 68% poisson uncertainties , while horizontal error bars denote the 16th and 84th percentiles of the distribution of galaxies within each bin .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this work , we measure specific sn rates using the loss `` full - optimal '' sample and two subsamples of this sample , labeled `` ssfr '' and `` metallicity , '' which are described in section  [ sec : galaxies ] . as one chooses progressively smaller subsamples of a given sample , there arises the possibility that any resulting measurements from those subsamples would be biased , relative to measurements performed with the main sample . to test for any such biases , and whether the sliding - bin rates are a good representation of the rates , figure  [ fig : all_samples ]",
    "shows the rates for each sn type as measured from the different subsamples and with various binning schemes .",
    "`` sn - fixed '' bins are chosen so that they contain roughly the same number of sne in each bin while `` mass - fixed '' bins contain roughly the same amount of stellar mass , in log scale .",
    "finally , we also show the rates in fixed bins of varying width , as calculated with the astroml @xcite realization of the @xcite bayesian blocks algorithm .",
    "the various binning schemes produce measurements that generally agree with each other , except at the lower end of the mass range , where the small number of galaxies and sne can cause relatively large fluctuations in the rates .",
    "it is also clear that the rates as measured with a sliding bin are a good representation of the data .",
    "moreover , the rates measured with the ssfr subsample are consistent with those measured with the main loss sample .",
    "the rates measured from the metallicity subsample , however , are markedly higher in the largest - mass bin for both sne ii and se sne ; no such bias is noticeable for the sn ia rates .",
    "we ascribe this bias to the small size of the metallicity subsample ( @xmath14% of the main loss sample ) .",
    "this bias means that a larger sample is required to test the validity of the correlations between the sn rates and metallicity shown in figure  [ fig : rates_oh ] .",
    "the connection between these correlations and the galaxy scaling relations between metallicity and stellar mass , however , should not be affected by this bias , as in this work we measure the latter scaling relation directly from the galaxies and sn hosts in the metallicity subsample .",
    "the likelihood ratio test is used to compare the goodness - of - fit of nested models , such as polynomials of increasing order . in this work ,",
    "we use the likelihood ratio test to compare between zeroth- , first- , and second - order polynomials as fits to various datasets . the likelihood ratio ( @xmath15 )",
    "is simply the ratio of the likelihoods ( @xmath16 ) of the data ( @xmath17 ) given the best - fitting parameters of each type of fit , @xmath18 for the null hypothesis ( the lower - order polynomial ) and @xmath19 for the model being tested : @xmath20 the likelihood ratio is distributed as a @xmath21 distribution , with the number of degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the degrees of freedom of the models tested ( one or two in our case ) .",
    "@xmath22 , so that through the likelihood ratio we can obtain a @xmath23-value for the significance of the rejection of the null hypothesis .",
    "these @xmath23-values can then be translated into gaussian standard deviations , so that here we report the significance of the tests in multiples of @xmath24 , with @xmath25 as the minimal significance for a `` discovery . ''    when fitting the sn rates ,",
    "the likelihood function is simply that of the poisson probability density function ( pdf ) , as the uncertainties of the rates are dominated by the sizes of the sn samples .",
    "the likelihood function is then @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of bins in which the rates are measured , @xmath28 is the observed number of sne , and @xmath29 is the number of sne resulting from the best fit to the rates .    the likelihood function of the rate - ratio measurements shown in figure  [ fig : rate_ratio ] is more complicated .",
    "formally , it should be the ratio ( @xmath30 ) of the poisson pdfs of the se sne , @xmath31 , and sne ii , @xmath32 , in each bin .",
    "however , as @xcite notes , if @xmath33 , the denominator vanishes , and @xmath15 is undefined .",
    "@xcite uses a truncated version of @xmath32 , so that @xmath34=1 $ ] , to solve this problem , but the resultant pdf of @xmath30 is hard to compute .",
    "however , for sufficiently large values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the poisson pdfs will approach the gaussian pdfs @xmath37 and @xmath38 , with means @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and standard deviations @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite calculated the ratio of normal pdfs . for gaussian functions , @xcite have shown that given that @xmath17 and @xmath43 are uncorrelated , and that the coefficients of variation satisfy @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the ratio @xmath30 can be transformed via the geary - hinkley transformation into @xmath46 and the pdf of @xmath47 will then be a normal distribution with @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",
    "the conditions on the coefficients are satisfied for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the latter conditions are satisifed for all binning methods of the rate ratio .",
    "however , owing to the small sn samples , the basic condition for the approximations described above  that the numbers of sne are large enough that their poisson pdfs approach gaussian ones  is clearly not satisifed . to alleviate this problem , when fitting the polynomials to the measurements , we take the upper uncertainty ( which , for a poisson distribution , is always larger than the lower uncertainty ) of each measurement as the overall uncertainty .                                                                      , a.  v. , li , w.  d. , treffers , r.  r. , & modjaz , m. 2001 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . 246 , iau colloq . 183 : small telescope astronomy on global scales , ed .",
