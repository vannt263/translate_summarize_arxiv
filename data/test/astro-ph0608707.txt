    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from @xmath0 interactions , estimated for different orbital phases , is shown in figure [ spectros ] .",
    "close to the periastron the absorption results to be significant , and mainly dominated by the circumstellar disk emission . on the other hand , at phase @xmath75 most of the radiation escapes from the source , making it detectable at this phase and not during the first accretion peak , when the ambient wind density is maximum .",

    "the magnetic field in the cascade region , originated in the star , was assumed to be lower than 0.1 g , assuring in this way a strongly compton dominated regime .",
    "we followed the cascades induced by the injected gamma - ray flux with mentioned photon index @xmath70 , during the periastron passage ( i.e. orbital separation of @xmath79 ) .",

    "the detection of the source at phase 0.5 is a consequence of the opacity effects and is independent of the dominant radiative process in the jet . even in hadronic models like the one presented here , near the periastron passage gamma - rays",
    "will initiate electromagnetic cascades with ic emission , hence the actual situation could be a mixture of radiative processes .",

    "detection of @xmath1-ray emission of ls  i + 61 303 at higher energies than those observed by magic ( e.g. at @xmath87 tev ) could give support to a hadronic model , and to the presence of intense magnetic fields at the base of the jet .    a clear distinction about the nature of most of the primary gamma - rays can be established through the detection of neutrinos , which are produced only in hadronic models . in the context of our model",
    ", we expect around 3 - 4 muon neutrinos per squared km per year at earth , so the source might be detectable by icecube ( christiansen et al .",
    "2006 , see also the discussion in torres & halzen 2006 ) .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , an alternative model for the gamma - ray production in ls  i + 61 303 involves an energetic pulsar which could generate a strong wind that would stop the accretion .",
    "particles might be accelerated at the colliding wind region , producing gamma - rays through ic and @xmath0 interactions ( dubus 2006b , chernyakova et al .",
    "however , it is not clear how the morphological and variability properties of the system might be explained in this scenario .",
    "what is clear is that the high accretion rates and the observed low x - ray luminosity seem to exclude a scenario based upon an accreting pulsar , since there is no trace of the emission from the heated surface .",
    "future observations with magic will help to detect the source close to the periastron and the spectral evolution along the orbit , providing in this way more constraints to the models .",
