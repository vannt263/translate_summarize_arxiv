    "the recent discoveries of ultracool stellar dwarfs and brown dwarfs have produced a need for an extension of the current system of stellar classification , whose latest spectral class has been m since near the very inception of classification .",
    "new spectral classes designated l and t have been proposed and are widely used now to describe the ultracool dwarfs . the l class ( martn et al . 1999 , hereafter m99 ; kirkpatrick et al . 1999 , hereafter k99 )",
    "is generally recognized to extend from the end of the m dwarf sequence ( t@xmath1  @xmath2  2200  k ) roughly to the temperature ( @xmath2  1400  k ) at which methane absorption becomes apparent in the h and k bands , signifying that ch@xmath3 is beginning to replace carbon monoxide ( co ) as the dominant carbon - bearing molecule .",
    "the t class ( k99 ) includes dwarfs with temperatures from @xmath21400  k down at least to the coolest ( @xmath2  800  k ) extra - solar objects currently measured , and probably beyond .",
    "m99 and k99 have developed classification systems for the l sequence , based on spectral features and continuum slopes in the optical ( 0.61.0@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the m99 system defines subclasses l0l6 , the k99 system l0l8 . using photometry and infrared ( 1.02.5  @xmath0 m ) spectroscopy leggett et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found the first examples of dwarfs in the transition region between the basic l and t spectral properties .",
    "burgasser et al . (",
    "2000 ) have observed a dozen t dwarfs at 1.0 - 2.5  @xmath0 m and have demonstrated the potential for defining a t sequence based on infrared indices . neither the details of a t classification scheme nor the manner by which the two classes might be smoothly conjoined has yet been proposed",
    ". keys to determining these are : ( 1 ) obtaining a larger set of infrared spectra of l and t dwarfs ; ( 2 ) observing in finer detail the transition between the classes ; and ( 3 ) developing an accurate infrared classification scheme for l dwarfs to complement the optical schemes .",
    "the last is essential , because late l and t dwarfs can not be easily classified optically due to their faintness .",
    "several groups already have begun exploring infrared schemes for l dwarfs ( delfosse et al .",
    "1999 ; tokunaga & kobayashi 1999 ; reid et al .",
    "2001 ; testi et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "this paper briefly describes a unified classification system that we have developed for l and t dwarfs .",
    "details are found in geballe et al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter g01 ) and leggett et al .",
    "a classification system for t dwarfs has also recently been proposed by burgasser et al .",
    "our work uses new and published spectra of 25 l dwarfs and 17 t dwarfs in the 0.6 - 2.5  @xmath0 m region .",
    "many of these objects have been discovered in the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "some are 2mass and denis objects classified previously by m99 , k99 , and kirkpatrick et al .",
    "most of the spectra were obtained by us , using cgs4 at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) and in a few cases with nirspec at the keck  ii telescope .",
    "we also use a few spectra from reid et al .",
    "the final reduced 1.0 - 2.5  @xmath0 m portions of the spectra are at resolving powers near 400 .",
    "we have examined these spectra for the most useful set of infrared indices for classification .",
    "successful indices should be monotonic across large swaths of the l and t sequences , based on individual spectral features or on continuum behavior over relatively narrow wavelength regions , and measurable at sites with average atmospheric transparency and intermediate - sized telescopes .",
    "m. the wavelengths of prominent spectral lines and bands are marked , and the wavelength ranges where the water and methane indices are calculated are indicated by dotted lines.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] m. the wavelengths of prominent spectral lines and bands are marked , and the wavelength ranges where the water and methane indices are calculated are indicated by dotted lines.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    we have found four indices in the 1.02.5  @xmath0 m region that satisfy our criteria .",
    "two of these , near 1.15  @xmath0 m and 1.5  @xmath0 m , are associated with prominent water bands and two , near 1.6  @xmath0 m and 2.2  @xmath0 m , with methane bands .",
    "their locations are shown in fig .",
    "1 , superposed on spectra of a mid - l and a mid - t dwarf .",
    "each index is a ratio of fluxes in two narrow wavelength intervals , one of which is on a portion of the molecular absorption band and the other of which is on nearby continuum .",
    "all four measure the increasing strengths of these bands with later spectral type .",
    "the 1.5  @xmath0 m index is monotonic across the entire l sequence .",
    "the 2.2  @xmath0 m index is useful from mid - l to the latest t dwarfs , while the other two indices are useful only for t dwarfs . for l dwarfs we also use two optical continuum indices `` pc3 '' and `` color - d '' from m99 and k99 , respectively ( we have slightly modified the k99 index ) to aid in classification .",
    "table  1 lists the values of the above six indices for each subclass . in specifying them we used the following approach .",
    "* we defined ranges for the pc3 , color - d , and 1.5  @xmath0 m indices to make our classifications generally consistent with those of m99 and k99 for l0l5 .",
    "* we define a specific , and we believe sensible , phenomenological boundary between the l and t classifications : the appearance of methane absorption in the h band near 1.6  @xmath0 m . * we define late l subtypes by extending the 1.5  @xmath0 m and 2.2  @xmath0 m indices smoothly from l5 to this boundary , where the the 1.6  @xmath0 m index begins to increase .",
    "this is best done by having ten l subtypes ( l0l9 ) , and thus our system corresponds more closely to that of k99 than m99 .",
    "* we define t subclasses by continuing the smooth progression of the 1.5  @xmath0 m and 2.2  @xmath0 m indices , supplemented with 1.15  @xmath0 m and 1.6  @xmath0 m indices , leaving room in a system of ten subclasses for a t9 type , yet to be discovered .",

    "final assignments , reported in g01 , are made by averaging the classifications from each index .",
    "typical uncertainties are @xmath41 subclass for l dwarfs and @xmath40.5 subclasses for t dwarfs .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the degree of self - consistency for two pairs of indices .",

    "figure 3 shows representative 1.52.5  @xmath0 m spectra of dwarfs spanning the l  t boundary .",
    "the 2.2  @xmath0 m methane band is first evident at l8 , roughly 2 subclasses prior to the onset of h band methane absorption .",
    "the first clear visual indication is a slight inflection at 2.20  @xmath0 m due to the sharp q branch of the @xmath5+@xmath6 band , but the effect of the broader absorption from the p and r branches is apparent in the index .",
    "by t0 , where the h band methane absorption first appears , the depression due to the 2.2  @xmath0 m methane band is more prominent and the co band head at 2.29  @xmath0 m has become weak . by t3",
    "the co band head is barely detectable and the dominant aborber at that wavelength is the strong @xmath6+@xmath7 band , which is centered at 2.32  @xmath0 m .",
    "in our proposed classification system the l and t sequences are seamlessly attached via indices common to both .",
    "the system also is tied to the optical systems of m99 and k99 via optical and infrared indices applicable to l0l6 dwarfs .",
    "spectra of additional l and t dwarfs are needed to improve the accuracy of both the subclass definitions and the optical - infrared link .",
    "it is likely that the coolest t dwarfs currently observed , here classified t8 , are near the end of the t sequence , as all absorption bands on which the classification is based are approaching totality at t8 ( g01 ) .",
    "however , once cooler dwarfs are discovered it may be necessary to alter the definitions of the t subclasses .",
    "finally , it is likely that a two - dimensional classification system will be required to incorporate the effects of surface gravity and possibly other factors such as photospheric dust .",
