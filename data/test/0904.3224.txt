    "mathematical properties of the lovelock terms have been studied in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",

    "this problem was encountered some time ago by teitelboim and zanelli@xcite working in the hamiltonian formalism and by choquet - bruhat who considered the cauchy problem@xcite . here",
    "we shall briefly review the problem , following ref .",
    "let us introduce a time - slicing , writing the metric in adm form and setting the shift to zero .",

    "is there some interpretation of the theory in which such inequalities on the curvature arise naturally ?",
    "in what follows , we develope some new ideas concerning the relation between weyl s classic formulae for the volume and area of a tube on the one hand , and lovelock gravity and the problem of determinism on the other .",

    "if any of the curvature radii are small compared to @xmath40 , we expect the formula to break down because different sections of the tube associated with different regions of @xmath37 can intersect .",
    "this would cause the formula to overcount the volume .",
    "it was recently pointed out by labbi@xcite that the curvature invariants appearing in weyl s formula are the same as those appearing in the lagrangian of lovelock s theory .",
    "so the volume of a tube coincides with the action of euclidean lovelock theory with a special choice of coupling constants . it would be interesting to generalise the tube formula to a minkowski space background",
    ". also , it may be of interest to find a tube formula in ( a)ds space .",
    "the generalisation to hyperbolic space is well known@xcite .",
    "the first question which arises in generalising to minkowski space is how to define the tube . in the euclidean case",
    "the definition is motivated by the intuitive fact that the shortest route from a point to a surface is the line that hits the surface normally . in minkowski space",
    "this is no longer true .",
    "indeed it would be futile to define the tube as the locus of points of less than @xmath40 spacelike proper distance from @xmath37 for a simple reason .",
    "let @xmath48 be a point on @xmath37 .",
    "then any points which are infinitesimally close to the lightcone of @xmath48 and which have spacelike separation from @xmath48 must be included in the tube .",
    "so a tube thus defined would stretch all the way out to future and past null infinity .",
    "however , even though the meaning is not quite the same as as in the euclidean case , we can still define the tube in the same way :    [ minkowski_tube_def ] the tube of @xmath49 in minkowski space @xmath50 is the set of all points of proper distance less than @xmath40 along a geodesic which intersects @xmath49 normally .    according to the above definition",
    ", the tube will not extend out towards null infinity unless the normal vector of @xmath49 becomes null at some point .",
    "so for an embedded submanifold of strictly minkowski signature , the tube is bounded .",
    "it is curious that , although the geometry of minkowskian tubes is quite different compared to their euclidean counterparts , the formula for the volume turns out to be the same . before considering the general proof of this ,",
    "let us check it explicitly with a pair of examples .",
    "first we consider the embedding of an @xmath51-sphere @xmath52 into @xmath53 and then the lorentzian equivalent , de sitter space embedded as a hyperboloid in minkowski space . in the first case ,",
    "the volume of the tube is the volume contained between two concentric spheres of radius @xmath54 and @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 using @xmath57 for the lovelock scalars of the sphere of radius @xmath58 we can expand the tube volume as : @xmath59 } \\frac{l^{2n+1}}{(2n + 1)!}\\int_{m } { \\cal l}^{(n)}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 .    in the second case ,",
    "we have @xmath61 realised by the embedding @xmath62 in @xmath63 .",
    "it is useful to parametrise this by @xmath64 etc . as with the sphere ,",
    "the normal vectors lie along rays through the origin and one finds that the tube is delimited by two concentric embedded @xmath65 spaces of curvature radii @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "the volume element is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the volume element on the hyperboloid of unit curvature .. this correctly accounts for the edge effects of the tube , because the lines @xmath70 const .",
    "coincide with the normal vectors ( see fig [ dsfig ] ) . ]",
    "embedded in minkowski space @xmath71 .",
    "a slice through the @xmath72 plane is shown .",
    "the tube is the shaded region between concentric @xmath65 spaces of curvature radii @xmath73 and @xmath55 .",
    "the normal vectors are aligned with rays through the origin.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    so we obtain for the volume : @xmath74 since the lovelock curvature scalars are the same for @xmath65 as for the sphere , we obtain the same formula ( [ spheretube ] ) .",
    "let us now consider the tube of a general lorentzian manifold @xmath75 .",
    "since the definition of a tube in terms of the normal vectors is the same as for the euclidean case , one would expect weyl s formula in terms of extrinsic curvatures@xcite to be the same .",
    "also , since the gauss - coddazzi equations are the same , we expect the formula ( [ weyl_tube_formula ] ) in terms of intrinsic curvatures to apply also to minkowski space . in order to confirm this ,",
    "let us briefly revisit the proof of the tube formula , formulating things in a terminology familiar to relativists using minkowskian signature .",
    "let us consider an infinitesimal region on @xmath76 and let @xmath77 be a set of orthonormal vectors forming a basis of the tangent space . in a local neighbourhood , this can be extended to an orthonormal basis of @xmath78 which can also be interpreted as a set of direction vectors in @xmath63 , denoted @xmath79 , where the @xmath80 are normal vectors to @xmath49 .",
    "consider an infinitesimal @xmath38-cube defined by the vectors @xmath81 @xmath82 , @xmath83 where @xmath84 are the infinitesimal line elements in the direction of the vector .",
    "now we displace the vertices of the cube by a vector @xmath85 in a normal direction .",
    "if there is extrinsic curvature then @xmath86 will vary from one vertex to another .",
    "therefore the displaced infinitesimal vectors will be @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the extrinsic curvature tensor w.r.t .",
    "the normal @xmath86 .",
    "the displaced @xmath38-volume element is therefore @xmath89 integrating these elements over @xmath90 and over @xmath76 , assuming that they do not intersect each other , gives : @xmath91 the calculation of combinatorial factors amounts to calculating the moments of the @xmath92-ball , @xmath93 , @xmath94 etc .",
    "since odd moments vanish , the extrinsic curvatures will always appear in pairs , @xmath95 when we expand out the determinant . in this way",
    ", the extrinsic curvatures can always be substituted for intrinsic curvatures using the gauss formula .",
    "since the normal space is euclidean , the gauss formula is the same as in the euclidean case @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the same combinatorial factors and signs must arise is of constant curvature , and read off the coefficients . ] .",
    "so we conclude :    let @xmath76 be a manifold with metric of minkowski signature embedded in minkowski space @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath97 be the @xmath40-tube of @xmath76 .",
    "assuming that every point in the tube has a unique geodesic which connects it with @xmath76 and intersects @xmath76 normally , the world - volume of the tube is correctly described by formula ( [ weyl_tube_formula ] ) .      in this case",
    "we have : @xmath98 with @xmath99 we note that the  magic \" combination of coupling constants has the value @xmath100 . for all dimensions @xmath101",
    "this is in the range @xmath102 .",
    "the chern - simons gravity theories correspond to @xmath103 and so it is not possible to obtain their action as a tube volume .",
    "previously , the value @xmath104 has been shown to be an exceptional case in the context of product spacetime solutions@xcite .",
    "also , in the context of the first order theory the value was found to be special , since this fine - tuning permitted compactified solutions with constant torsion on a three - sphere@xcite .",
    "here in the context of tube volumes ( torsion - free by construction ) we find @xmath105 , providing further evidence that this value is special in some sense .",
    "in fact , since a general 5-manifold may need up to @xmath106 dimensions in order for an embedding to exist , we should take @xmath107 and so @xmath108 to good approximation .    the lovelock theory defined by",
    "the above action admits two constant curvature solutions @xmath109 with gaussian curvature given by the roots of a quadratic equation @xmath110 .",
    "so for large @xmath111 the characteristic curvature radius of the space - time is given by @xmath112 .",
    "therefore the size of the ( 5-dimensional ) universe is much smaller then the thickness of the tube .",
    "however , in this regime the tube formula is not valid and so we can not regard the solutions as meaningful . it can be checked that this appearance of an enormous effective cosmological constant is a generic feature of for all @xmath38 .",
    "we therefore look for an appropriate term to add to the action , which may cancel the cosmological constant .      if we think of the tube volume as an action functional of the intrinsic metric , it is interesting to ask what are the extrema of the action .",
    "if one looks for a maximally symmetric solution , with constant curvature @xmath113 , the lovelock field equations will give a polynomial of order @xmath114 $ ] for @xmath113 .",
    "so for @xmath38 odd one always has at least one solution .",
    "a preliminary investigation suggests that , for real roots @xmath113 tends to be large compared to @xmath115 i.e. it describes a geometry where the volume formula is expected to break down .",
    "also @xmath113 is always negative .    in order to ensure a maximally symmetric solution with small curvature",
    ", it seems to be necessary to use the tube area formula .",
    "the surface area of the tube is : @xmath116 }       \\frac{(n - d)!!}{(n - d + 2n-2 ) ! !",
    "( 2n ) ! ! } \\ { l^{n - d+2n-1 } }       \\int_m { \\cal l}^{(n)}\\ , , \\ ] ] a more general action would then be @xmath117 , with @xmath118 constants .",
    "the analogy would be with a drop of fluid , whose internal energy has an extensive part and also a contribution from the surface energy .",
    "we shall consider the simple choice @xmath119 this choice allows us to cancel completely the term proportional to the area of @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting action depends only on the curvature terms , @xmath120 }       \\frac{(n - d-2)!!}{(n - d + 2n ) ! !",
    "( 2n-2 ) ! ! } \\ { l^{n - d+2n } }",
    "\\int_m { \\cal l}^{(n)}\\ , , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and therefore minkowski space will be a solution .",
    "more generally , the absence of the bare cosmological constant ( @xmath121 ) term means that there will be a branch of the solutions where the curvature is small compared to @xmath115 .",
    "these solutions will be like solutions of einstein s equation with higher order corrections in @xmath122 .",
    "solutions for @xmath37 belonging to this branch can have tubes that do not self intersect .",
    "normalising so that the coefficient of the einstein - hilbert term is unity , the coefficients of the lovelock series are : @xmath123 etc . generally @xmath124",
    "to see when determinism breaks down in this theory given initial data @xmath21 and @xmath125 on a space - like hypersurface . as discussed in footnote 1 , this is not always equivalent to the hamiltonian evolution .",
    "the former approach will arise naturally when integrating by finite element approximation .",
    "as such it is relevant to numerical evolution of solutions .",
    "the latter approach is more correct from the point of view of taking limits , for example when we consider classical solutions as arising from the method of stationary phase@xcite .",
    "here we follow the definition of ref .",
    "@xcite@xcite , because it allows us to restore determinism by imposing a simple inequality on the riemann tensor . for the hamiltonian evolution",
    "no such simple condition exists . ] , we need to examine the determinant @xmath126 .",
    "first , in order to simplify the expression for @xmath127 , let us introduce lovelock tensors , with two and four free indices , of the spatial components of the curvature : @xmath128 then we obtain the general formula : @xmath129 } n \\alpha_n \\left (   ( \\mathcal { i}^{(n-1)})^{\\ \\ cd}_{ab } - g_{ab } ( \\mathcal { h}^{(n-1)})^{cd }   \\right)\\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] now we shall evaluate this for the choice of coupling coefficients ( [ special_couplings ] ) obtained in the preceeding section .",
    "let us assume that the embedding space is high dimensional : @xmath130 .",
    "therefore @xmath131 @xmath132 }   \\left(\\frac{l^2}{2n}\\right)^{p } \\frac{1}{p ! }   \\left (   ( \\mathcal { i}^{(p)})^{\\ \\ cd}_{ab } - g_{ab } ( \\mathcal { h}^{(p)})^{cd }   \\right)\\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the determinant will never vanish if all eigenvalues of @xmath35 are much smaller than unity ( in an appropriate frame , e.g. an orthonormal frame , we may say that all the components are much less than unity )",
    ". this will always be the case provided all @xmath133 .",
    "determinism will only be in danger of breaking down once riemann tensor components become of order @xmath134 .",
    "as mentioned previously , the tube formula breaks down if the tube intersects itself in some way .",
    "the tube formula is valid provided every point in the tube has a unique geodesic which connects it with @xmath76 and intersects @xmath76 normally is bijective for normal vectors of length @xmath42 ] .",
    "it is easy to check that :    the tube formula in minkowski space breaks down locally around a point @xmath136 if any of the eigenvalues of the extrinsic curvature matrices @xmath137 is greater than or equal to @xmath138 in magnitude .",
    "furthermore , at least locally , requiring the absolute value of all the eigenvalues of the @xmath139 to be less than @xmath138 is a sufficient condition for the validity of the tube formula . in view of the gauss relation",
    ", this means that the magnitude of components of the riemann tensor in an appropriate basis are certainly less than @xmath134 .",
    "in fact , since the sectional curvatures will be less than @xmath115 , the tube formula is expected to break down when the riemann tensor components ( in an orthonormal frame say ) are of order @xmath115 .      although we have only given an order of magnitude estimate , the result is quite compelling .",
    "it gives us strong evidence that the domain of validity of the tube formula is contained within the domain of validity of determinism .",
    "_ if this is so , it means that in regions where the curvature blows up , the tube formula breaks down before determinism breaks down . _",
    "when the tube formula breaks down , it is because elements of the extrinsic geometry interfere with the simple expression of the volume and area in terms of intrinsic geometry of @xmath37 .",
    "if we regard ( [ fundamental ] ) as the fundamental definition of the action , then formula ( [ not_fundamental ] ) is an effective description only when extrinsic curvatures are small .",
    "once they become large , there is a phase transition to a regime where the geometrical degrees of freedom are different .",
    "therefore , instead of a phase transition to a nondeterministic ( and therefore classically ill - defined ) theory , we have a phase transition to a different sector of the theory where the tube volume and area are not described entirely in terms of the intrinsic geometry of @xmath37 , but where extrinsic geometry of the embedding becomes relevant as a physical degree of freedom .    in all of this",
    "we are assuming that in the sector described by ( [ not_fundamental ] ) it is legitimate to vary the action with respect to the intrinsic metric of @xmath37 , rather than w.r.t .",
    "the embedding itself .",
    "this is potentially a rather big weakness , which we will pick up on again in the concluding section .",
    "we have treated space - time and its tube as embedded in some minkowski space of higher dimension in such a way that the intrinsic geometry of spacetime coincides with the induced geometry of the embedding .",
    "so far we have just assumed that such isometric embeddings ( of the appropriate level of smoothness ) exist .",
    "now it is necessary to take this question seriously . for riemannian manifolds ,",
    "it is a classic result of j. nash that any manifold may be smoothly isometrically embedded into euclidean space of large enough dimension . for manifolds of lorentzian signature , we need to know what kind of manifolds have such an embedding in @xmath63 . fortunately , in recent years a very satisfactory answer to this question has emerged .",
    "so how does nash s embedding theorem generalise to minkowski space ?",
    "clearly , not every space - time admits such an embedding .",
    "for example , if space - time is not time - orientable it can not be embedded with @xmath140 time dimensions .",
    "in fact greene@xcite and clarke@xcite independently showed that any pseudo - riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into @xmath141 for large enough @xmath48 and @xmath142 .",
    "however , for the purposes of the tube formula , such embeddings are not acceptable , due to the problem of defining a tube when there are null geodesics in the normal space . ] . using straightforward arguments , penrose showed that the manifold must admit a spacelike surface separating space - time into two disconnected regions ( past and future ) , such that every causal path cuts the surface no more than once and every timelike curve ending on the surface has bounded proper time@xcite ( note that this is weaker than global hyperbolicity- for example take a globally hyperbolic space - time and remove some points or timelike surfaces .",
    "the resulting spacetime will not be globally hyperbolic but it will still obey the above condition ) . a highly non - trivial result - almost the converse of penrose s - obtained recently , is the following remarkable theorem@xcite :    [ iff ] any globally hyperbolic space - time manifold @xmath76 admits a global smooth isometric embedding into minkowski space @xmath63 for large enough @xmath111 .",
    "the current upper bound for what is a sufficiently large value of @xmath111 is @xmath143 i.e. one higher than the corresponding upper bound for euclidean manifolds .",
    "so if we want to study four - dimensional space - times , we should embed them in at least 19 dimensions to be sure that an embedding exists . for five dimensions",
    ", we should embed them in 26 dimensions etc .    as mentioned above ,",
    "global hyperbolicity is not a necessary condition for the embedding .",
    "however , the slightly weaker condition of causal simplicity is a necessary condition@xcite .",
    "it is quite wonderful that the existence of the embedding is guaranteed by only one requirement- and a very welcome requirement it is too .",
    "a globally hyperbolic space - time is the arena for deterministic physics .",
    "this complements rather well the ( heuristic ) results of the previous section .",
    "weyl s formulae for the volume @xmath144 and surface area @xmath145 of a tube in euclidean space have been shown to generalise straightforwardly to a tube surrounding a pseudo - riemannian manifold embedded in minkowski space .",
    "the resulting formulae correspond to the action of lovelock gravity , with a special combination of the coefficients .",
    "we have focussed on just one spacial case , taking a combination @xmath146 so that the bare cosmological constant term vanishes from the lovelock series . in this case evidence",
    "was found that the lovelock description of the tube volume breaks down _ before _ determinism breaks down .",
    "therefore , instead of the theory itself breaking down , one would have a phase transformation to a different sector , governed by different geometrical degrees of freedom .",
    "for the future , a more careful study of the curvature inequalities is needed to verify this , also taking into account other linear combinations of @xmath144 and @xmath145 .    in order to obtain the equations of lovelock gravity , we have not varied w.r.t .",
    "the embedding , but rather the intrinsic geometry of @xmath37 .",
    "this means , for instance that we regard translations of the tube in minkowski space as pure gauge . also , in higher dimensions",
    ", it is possible to have changes in the extrinsic curvature which preserve the intrinsic metric and curvature .",
    "this is known as _",
    "isometric bending_. these are also treated as pure gauge .",
    "however , one is at liberty to question this approach .",
    "if the embedding is regarded as real rather than just metaphorical , the rigid motions would then be more correctly regarded as zero modes of the theory .",
    "also the isometric bending would become something like zero modes .",
    "if we follow the string / brane approach in constructing the variational principle , we should regard the embedding coordinates @xmath147 as the degrees of freedom . to derive the field equations , one follows exactly the same argument as with standard regge - teitelboim geodetic brane gravity@xcite@xcite .",
    "noting that @xmath148 and using the bach - lanczos identity @xmath149 we get : @xmath150 so we see that the solutions of lovelock gravity would be a subset of the resulting solutions .",
    "however , there are also other solutions such as the rather trivial @xmath151 .",
    "the possible degeneration of this term multiplying the field equations will affect any conclusions regarding determinism .",
    "therefore it may be desirable to avoid varying w.r.t .",
    "@xmath147 . more study is needed .    that there is a formal connection@xcite between weyl s tube formula and lovelock gravity is , in the authors opinion , of undoubted interest .",
    "it remains to be checked more carefully if this truly provides a resolution to the problem of indeterminism ( or any other physical problems ) . in our method",
    "there is perhaps some mixing of philosophies between the realist and the metaphorical interpretation of the embedding space , which needs to be untangled in a satisfactory manner .",
    "this work is offered as an introduction and perhaps an invitation to further study of the subject .",

    "<S> in four space - time dimensions , there are good theoretical reasons for believing that general relativity is the correct geometrical theory of gravity , at least at the classical level . if one admits the possibility of extra space - time dimensions , what would we expect classical gravity to be like ? </S>",
    "<S> it is often stated that the most natural generalisation is lovelock s theory , which shares many physical properties with gr . </S>",
    "<S> but there are also key differences and problems . </S>",
    "<S> a potentially serious problem is the breakdown of determinism , which can occur when the matrix of coefficients of second time derivatives of the metric degenerates . </S>",
    "<S> this can be avoided by imposing inequalities on the curvature . </S>",
    "<S> here it is argued that such inequalities occur naturally if the lovelock action is obtained from weyl s formulae for the volume and surface area of a tube . </S>",
    "<S> part of the purpose of this article is to give a treatment of the weyl tube formula in terminology familiar to relativists and to give an appropriate ( straightforward ) generalisation to a tube embedded in minkowski space .    </S>",
