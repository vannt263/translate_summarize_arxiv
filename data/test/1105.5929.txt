    "star forming regions and interstellar media have been well studied in all the wavelength regimes from radio to @xmath9-ray .",
    "an advantage using far - infrared ( far - ir ) light is that we can trace photo - ionization and dissociation regions without needing to correct for extinction . in the far - ir region , there are important forbidden lines of atoms and ions , such as [ oi ]  63 ,  146 , [ oiii ]  88 , [ nii ]  122 ,  205 , and [ cii ]  158 , which are good tracers of the interstellar media in various gas phases .",
    "30 doradus ( 30 dor ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is one of the most famous massive star forming regions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "its distance is about 50 kpc and the physical scale of @xmath10 corresponds to 15 pc . in the center ,",
    "as revealed by the hubble space telescope , there are a lot of massive stars in a compact region , which is named the r136 super star cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the bubble of @xmath10 in diameter exists around the center of r136 , where gas is almost completely evacuated ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "prominent x - ray and h@xmath11 filamentary and/or shell structures are extended in the north and the west direction from the center @xcite . in the optical emission lines such as [ sii ] @xmath126724 and [ oiii ] @xmath125007 , widely extended components of ionized gas were revealed around the 30 dor region by the university of michigan / ctio magellanic cloud emission line survey ( mcels ; @xcite ) .    from the early era of ir astronomy ,",
    "the 30 dor region has been studied by various ir observations . using the fifi instrument of the kuiper airborne observatory ( kao )",
    ", @xcite observed the far - ir forbidden lines of [ cii ]  158 and [ oi ]  63 ,  146 in the 30 dor region , and made a line intensity map of [ cii ]  158 with an arc - minute spatial resolution over @xmath13 area .",
    "balloon - borne ir telescopes , such as balloon - borne infrared carbon explore ( bice ) , observed the lmc region .",
    "bice mapped the entire area of the lmc by the [ cii ] line with a beam of about @xmath14 size .",
    "@xcite discussed the photoelectric heating and [ cii ] cooling in the lmc .",
    "the first powerful tool for ir spectroscopy was provided by the infrared space observatory ( iso ) operated in the late 1990s .",
    "the isocam made line intensity maps of [ neii ]  12.81 and [ neiii ]  15.56 emission lines for the central @xmath15 area of the 30 dor region @xcite .",
    "the ionization potentials of ne and ne@xmath16 are 21.56 and 40.96 ev , respectively .",
    "therefore , the [ neii ] and [ neiii ] lines are good tracers of highly - ionized gas , similarly to the [ oiii ] line with the ionization potential of 35.12 ev . in the far - ir ,",
    "the iso / lws observed more than 10 points with different physical conditions for the 30 dor region ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the spatial information provided by the iso / lws was rather poor , because these observations were performed by a single beam .    for technical reasons , far - ir spectral mapping observations with high spatial resolution were difficult .",
    "after iso , akari takes a unique position in the far - ir spectroscopy .",
    "the japanese ir astronomical satellite , akari @xcite , which was launched on february 21 , 2006 ( ut ) , has two kinds of focal - plane instruments ; infrared camera ( irc ) @xcite and far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) @xcite , to cover the whole ir regime from 2 to 180  . far - ir spectroscopic capability of akari is realized by a fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) as a function of the fis @xcite .",
    "the advantage of fis - fts over the iso / lws is an imaging spectroscopic capability with higher spatial resolution ; each pixel of the fis - fts detector arrays can simultaneously take a spectrum with about 40@xmath17 ( fwhm ) angular resolution , while the iso / lws has the single beam of 80@xmath17 in fwhm .",
    "the physical scales corresponding to their resolutions in the lmc are about 10 pc and 20 pc for fis - fts and the iso / lws , respectively .",
    "spectral maps with high spatial resolution are essential to investigate the interstellar media , especially those around ionized regions .",
    "the structure of an ionized region is determined by the locations of ionizing stars and the distribution of the ambient interstellar media .",
    "high spatial resolution maps of the far - ir lines clearly show the structure of star forming regions relating to the environment of star formation .",
    "spitzer space telescope made spectral line maps of 30 dor by using the irs and the mips in a sed mode in the spitzer legacy survey of the lmc : surveying the agents of a galaxy s evolution ( sage ; @xcite ) , which revealed the ionization state of the 30 dor region and super star cluster r136 @xcite .",
    "akari fis - fts observed many local regions distributed around the 30 dor region and provided their spectral maps . in this paper , we present the large - scale spatial distribution of the [ oiii ]  88 line emission around the 30 dor region .    the advantage of the akari [ oiii ] data over the isocam [ neiii ] and the spitzer data is the spatial coverage of much wider areas , i.e. , those far outside the bubbles around 30 dor .",
    "thus our data provide information on the ism influenced by intense radiation from massive stars rather than shocks by stellar winds and supernovae in r136 .",
    "the optical [ oiii ] map with mcels also covers a large area .",
    "as compared to the far - ir [ oiii ] map , the optical map has a higher spatial resolution , but suffers extinction effects in dense gas regions , which may hamper accurate measurements of the change of the line intensity with the distance from r136 .",
    "akari carried out far - ir spectroscopic observations from april 2006 to august 2007 . as a result , about 600 pointed observations were performed with fis - fts .",
    "more than two thirds of the fis - fts observations were parallel observations with the irc , in which the irc has priority for observations .",
    "since the fields - of - view ( fovs ) of the irc and the fis are separated by about half a degree , fis - fts observed off - primary target skies in the parallel observations . yet",
    "these data are useful as a spectroscopic survey of the diffuse interstellar medium , since many irc observations concentrate on the galactic plane and the lmc .    in this paper , we selected 14 pointed observations around the 30 dor regions , which targeted relatively bright regions among the fis - fts observations of the lmc .",
    "an observation log is summarized in table [ table : obs_log ] , and observed areas are shown in figure [ fig : obs_area ] , plotted on the spitzer / mips  24 map from the sage program . for comparison ,",
    "the observational positions of the iso / lws are marked by the small open circles with a size of the beam , and the area of the spectral mapping with the spitzer / mips in a sed mode is indicated by the rectangle in the center of 30 dor .",
    "although our observations do not cover the center of 30 dor , they cover wide areas around the 30 dor region and the south ridge . as shown in figure [ fig : obs_area ] , our observational areas are located on the periphery of the area covered with spitzer and thus complementary to the spitzer observations .",
    "each observing point has 60 pixels with a fov of 30@xmath18 30@xmath17 for each pixel in the short wavelength band , and 45 pixels with a @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath19 pixel fov in the long wavelength band .",
    "all the observational data analyzed in this paper are taken in a low resolution mode ( named sed mode ) , whose spectral resolution is about 1.2 cm@xmath4 .",

    "we can see a global correlation between the [ oiii ] and h@xmath29 emissions for a range of about one and a half orders of magnitude . the correlation , however , is not so tight at the higher line intensity region . a possible reason is difference in ionization degrees of the gases associated with the h@xmath29 and [ oiii ]  88 emission ; much higher energies of photons ( @xmath31 35.12 ev ) are required to ionize o@xmath16 to o@xmath1 than to ionize h atom .",

    "we consider a conservative case that the gas density is constant at the value estimated in the peripheral region . yet , from figure [ fig : r_depend ] , it is clear that the simple calculation can not explain the widely - extended distribution of the [ oiii ] line emission .",
    "the central bubble of 1@xmath37 in diameter would increase the strmgren radius , but its presence does not dramatically change the result . to explain the observed distribution , we have to assume a lot of hidden massive stars , and/or non - uniform distribution of the interstellar media , that is , clumpy distribution and leakage of ionizing photons .",
    "it is not likely that a lot of embedded massive stars are hidden in the field .",
    "if the gas density is reduced down to 10 @xmath7 , the strmgren radius expands to @xmath38 , which is comparable to the observed size of the distribution of the [ oiii ] emission .",
    "therefore a picture of the clumpy distribution of the interstellar media with a volume filling factor of @xmath39 is a plausible explanation .",
    "thus it is difficult to explain the ionization in the areas far away from 30 dor solely by radiation from massive stars in r136 .",
    "however many other massive stars are also distributed widely in the 30 dor region in addition to those in r136 .",

    "( 120mm,150mm)figure07.eps    in order to evaluate the contribution of hidden sources of ionization to the observed distribution of the [ oiii ] line emission , in figure [ fig : qi_oiii ] , we plot the [ oiii ] line intensity as a function of the o@xmath16-ionizing photon flux expected from the cataloged stars .",

    "it is consistent with the similar trend of radial dependence between the [ oiii ] emission and the continuum emission as seen in figure [ fig : r_depend ] .",
    "this correlation is interesting because they are likely of different origins ; the far - ir continuum represents the dust emission mostly coming from neutral regions , while the [ oiii ] emission originates in highly - ionized gas regions .",
    "thus the correlation suggests that the highly - ionized gas and dust are mixed well and exist in the same region , or have a clumpy structure where the dust is shielded from energetic photons by local dense gases .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the widely extended distribution of the [ oiii ] emission .",
    "( 80mm,75mm)figure09.eps    the ionization of the sw region does not seem to be related to the central sources in the 30 dor region as seen in figure [ fig : r_depend ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : corr_cnt ] , all the data points seem to follow the global trend of correlation . by looking locally in detail , however , the sw group has a much weaker dependence of the [ oiii ] intensity on the far - ir continuum emission , i.e. no clear correlation between the [ oiii ] and the dust emission , suggesting that the dust and ionized gases are not mixed well in this region . as described above ,",
    "most data points of the sw region are located on the supershell of the supernova remnants 30 dor c @xcite .",
    "then , a large fraction of dust in the supershell may have been destroyed by the supernovae .",
    "we have performed spectroscopic surveys of the lmc with akari / fis - fts with a good spatial resolution of about @xmath10 .",
    "we have analyzed spectral data from the 14 observational points distributed widely around the 30 dor region on a degree scale .",
    "we find that the [ oiii ]  88 emission is widely extended by more than @xmath0 ( 150 pc ) from the central super star cluster , r136 .",
    "since the [ oiii ] line traces highly - ionized gas regions heated by very massive stars , the detection of widely extended [ oiii ] emission suggests that energetic photons are escaping into regions far from massive stars localized at the center of the 30 dor region .",
    "it is unlikely that a lot of embedded massive stars are hidden in the outer region of 30 dor .",
    "therefore , a plausible interpretation is that the interstellar medium has a patchy or porous structure around the 30 dor region , so that high - energy photons can pervade into wider areas .",
    "this is also supported by a good correlation between the [ oiii ] emission and the far - ir continuum emission , suggesting that the gas and dust are well mixed in the highly - ionized region where the dust survives in clumpy dense clouds shielded from the energetic photons .",
    "we would express many thanks to an anonymous referee for giving us important comments .",
    "we thanks all members of the akari project .",
    "particularly , we express our gratitude to the akari data reduction team for their dedicated work in generating the tsd , and developing data analysis pipelines .",
    "akari is a jaxa project with the participation of esa .",
    "this work is based in part on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa .",
    "this work also made use of data product from the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas ( shassa ) , which is supported by the national science foundation .",
