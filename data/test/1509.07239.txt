    "spiral arms in disc galaxies can be classified into three categories : grand - design , multiple - arm , and flocculent spirals @xcite .",
    "grand - design spiral arms are large - scale coherent , symmetric , two - armed patterns ( e.g. ngc 628 ) , whose number fraction is more than @xmath3 in nearby spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "observations show that grand - design spirals are associated with bars or companions @xcite , suggesting that a bar or companion is essential in forming a grand - design spiral in a disc galaxy . in barred spiral galaxies ,",
    "the grand - design spirals extend from the ends of the bars . furthermore , although some studies found little or no correlation between bar strengths and spiral arm strengths @xcite , other studies have found correlations @xcite .",
    "these observations , therefore , suggest that bars drive grand - design spirals with the _ same _ pattern speed as the bars .",
    "this ` bar - driven spiral hypothesis ' has been promoted by the ballistic closed - orbit theory , which is based on non - self - gravitating hydrodynamic simulations in fixed barred potentials ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this theory explains the physical mechanism responsible for the formation of the spirals in barred galaxies in terms of closed orbits of the gas ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the spiral arms in barred galaxies are regarded as _ kinematic _ density waves ( i.e. crowding of gaseous closed orbits ) driven by an external barred potential . however , spiral arms in observed barred galaxies are composed of not gas but stars ; therefore , theories based on stellar dynamics are required for investigating the origin of spiral arms in barred galaxies .    on the other hand , the `",
    "invariant manifold theory ' is another bar - driven spiral theory @xcite and has been developed from stellar orbital theories in fixed barred potentials @xcite .",
    "essentially , the back - bones of barred spirals are bunches of untrapped stars escaped from unstable lagrangian points @xmath4 and @xmath5 close to the ends of the bar .",
    "this means that stars should _ move along _ the arms rather than across the arms @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is completely different from the quasi - stationary density wave theory , which predicts that stars should _ traverse _ the arms but would stay longer in the arm than in the inter - arm region @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the manifold theory predicts a rigidly rotating spiral arm with a similar pattern speed to that of the bar ( i.e. @xmath6 ) and that stronger bars should have more open spirals compared to weaker bars @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite extended the classical epicyclic orbit approximation to the ` p - ellipse ' orbit approximation @xcite and proposed that ensembles of eccentric resonant orbits excited in lindblad zones can provide a backbone for generating kinematic bars and spiral waves .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that some resonant eccentric orbits have a similar appearance to invariant manifold orbits .",
    "the manifold theory and eccentric resonant orbits theory , however , do not consider the self - gravity of stars , despite the fact that the self - gravity of stellar discs plays an essential role in the dynamical evolution of spirals via the ( non - linear ) swing amplification mechanism @xcite .",
    "the swing amplification mechanism , proposed by toomre in @xcite , operates through a combination of three aspects , i.e. the shearing flow , epicyclic motions , and the disc self - gravity , in disc galaxies - body simulations of galactic discs partly supported this mechanism @xcite . however , @xmath0-body simulations of galactic discs suggested the importance of nonlinearity , such as mode - mode coupling and radial migration of stars @xcite , in the dynamical evolution of spiral arms . ] . because the amplification is most efficient around the corotating radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "different _ pattern speeds , and they are independent patterns @xcite or are coupled via non - linear interactions @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite performed @xmath0-body simulations of pure stellar barred spiral galaxies and analysed the spiral rotation frequency from _ selected _ snapshots where the spiral amplitude is above 70% of the maximum amplitude ; they concluded that the spiral rotation frequency approaches the bar s rigid body rotation in barred galaxies with the increment of bar strength . on the other hand , @xcite performed @xmath0-body / hydrodynamic simulations of a barred spiral galaxy and suggested that the spiral arms are not rigidly rotating patterns but transient recurrent patterns ( i.e. dynamic spirals ) , and these results are similar to those obtained from multiple arm spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found that spiral arms in barred galaxies are dynamic patterns whose rotation frequencies decrease with the radius in such a way that the rotation frequency is similar to the rotation of stars .",

    "such behaviour of the stellar bar is usually seen in @xmath0-body simulations of isolated discs @xcite as well as cosmological simulations of disc galaxies @xcite .",
    "we compare our results with the swing amplification theory to investigate the physical origin of the short - term evolutional behaviour among spiral parameters . before this comparison , we briefly review the physical essence of the swing amplification ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for details ) .",
    "the swing amplification operates through a combination of the shearing flow , epicyclic motions , and disc self - gravity , which play roles in promoting or suppressing the formation of structures in disc galaxies @xcite . since the direction of epicyclic motion of a star is the same as the direction which the spiral arm is sheared by differential rotation , stabilisation by rotation is reduced , and the perturbation can grow via the usual jeans instability @xcite . as a concrete example",
    ", we consider a disc galaxy with a nearly flat rotation curve as our simulated galaxy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : initrc ] ) .",
    "because the angular speed follows as @xmath83 , the timescale of epicyclic motion is given by @xmath84 while the timescale of involvement with the spiral arm is given by @xmath85 comparing the above two time - scales , we can see that @xmath86 .",
    "the shearing motion cancels out the stabilisation effect of epicyclic motions , and thus , the structure can grow via self - gravity in a short time as compared to @xmath87 .    to compare the results described in section [ subsec : shortterm ] with the predictions from the swing amplification theory",
    ", we calculate the pitch angle at the maximum amplitude phase , @xmath88 , expected from the swing amplification theory .",
    "following @xcite , @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a dimensionless shear rate .",
    "this equation predicts that @xmath88 is a decreasing function of @xmath91 .",
    "this trend matches observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath0-body simulations of disc galaxies @xcite .    in bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : pitchangleamplitudeplane ] , we plot the expected values of @xmath88 as shaded regions . in the outer regions at @xmath92 kpc and @xmath38 kpc ,",
    "the peak pitch angles ( around @xmath93@xmath94 ) of the simulations match the predictions well .",
    "similar results have already been obtained for @xmath0-body simulations of multiple arm spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the peak pitch angles at the inner regions ( i.e. @xmath95 kpc and @xmath96 kpc ) are somewhat larger than the predicted values due to the effect of the central bar .",
    "furthermore , we also compare the frequency of appearance for @xmath97 with @xmath88 .",
    "the top panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : pitchangleamplitudeplane ] show that the most frequent pitch angle matches the values predicted by the swing amplification theory , except for @xmath95 kpc .",
    "in addition , the swing amplification theory can explain the evolutionary behaviour between @xmath66 and @xmath64 because the amplification is most efficient around the co - rotating radius ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , the top panels in fig . [",
    "fig : amplitudepatternspeedplane ] show that the most frequent phase speed decreases as a function of the radius , but it is the same as or slightly faster than the galactic angular speed , except for @xmath95 kpc .",
    "the previous @xmath0-body simulations of barred spiral galaxies have also pointed out that the spiral arms rotate with a decreasing angular rotation speed that is slightly faster than the galactic angular speed @xcite .",
    "however , these studies have not been compared with the swing amplification theory .      in the above subsections",
    ", we presented the short - term behaviour of the grand - design spiral and showed that these results can be explained by the swing amplification mechanism .",
    "however , this mechanism can not explain the behaviour in the inner regions ( e.g. @xmath98 kpc ) . in this subsection , to clarify behaviour of the spiral at the inner regions , we investigate how the bar affects the dynamics of the grand - design spirals .    to clarify the cone of influence of the bar , we plot the results for the ( spiral ) amplitude @xmath64 with respect to the bar amplitude @xmath99 in fig .",
    "[ fig : barspiralamplitude ] . here , we measure @xmath99 with the amplitude of the @xmath51 mode at @xmath100 kpc . at @xmath70 4 kpc ,",
    "there is a clear trend showing that , as the spiral amplitudes become larger , the bar becomes stronger .",
    "we see a similar trend at @xmath70 6 , but it has considerable scatter around the correlation . in contrast , the results at @xmath92 and 10 kpc show no clear correlation .",
    "these results suggest that the bar affects the dynamics of the spiral arm well beyond its co - rotation radius ( @xmath101 kpc ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshotevolutionevery100myr ] ) and possibly @xmath102 kpc .",
    "this maximum radius corresponds to approximately 1.52 bar radius and is consistent with observational values ( approximately 1.41.6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we , therefore , suggest that the bar drives the spiral arm within approximately 1.52 bar radius .    to see the dynamical behaviour of the bar - driven spirals , we investigate whether the inner spiral arms are consistent with the predictions from the invariant manifold theory .",
    "as described in section [ sec : intro ] , the manifold theory provides two predictions : ( 1 ) the spirals in strongly barred galaxies will be more open than those in less strongly barred ones , and ( 2 ) the spiral arms should be a bundle of orbits guided by the manifolds so that stars should move along the arms rather than across them .",
    "we compare the simulated barred spirals with these predictions .",
    "[ fig : barspiralpitchangle ] shows the results for the spiral pitch angle @xmath65 versus @xmath99 .",
    "we can not see any correlation between @xmath65 and @xmath99 for @xmath92 and 10 kpc .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath103 and 6 kpc , we see that the low pitch angle spirals ( @xmath104 ) are lacking for stronger bars ( @xmath105 ) . in this sense",
    ", our results correspond to the predictions from the invariant manifold theory , although there is considerable scatter for weaker bars .",
    "furthermore , to see whether stars move along the spiral arm as predicted from the invariant manifold theory , we select the star particles located at the grand - design spiral at @xmath106 gyr and then follow the trajectories of these particles from 2.70 gyr to 2.84 gyr . these trajectories are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : startracer ] . at @xmath107 gyr ,",
    "the chosen stars are located at both sides of the arm , and these stars form the arm at @xmath108 gyr . after that , these stars escape from the arm to both sides .",
    "therefore , the motions of the stars therefore are not simply consistent with the prediction from the invariant manifold theory .",
    "@xcite suggested that co - rotating spirals with bars are supported by resonant orbits excited in outer lindblad zones , which are the parents of a continuous sequence of resonant radii . to investigate whether this is true",
    ", we plotted sample orbits of these particles in the rotating frame in figs .",
    "[ fig : orbits]a and [ fig : orbits]b .",
    "we could not find any resonant closed orbits , rather most orbits show monotonic centre shifts of the radial oscillations ( i.e. radial migrations of stars ; fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits]c ) due to scattering by the spiral arms as presented by @xmath0-body simulations of galactic discs @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the _ collective motion _ of stars might be an essential ingredient for generating dynamic spirals due to a non - linear combination among the shearing flow , non - linear epicyclic ( or p - ellipse ) motions , and self - gravity ( see section [ subsec : swa ] ) .",
    "however , this orbit analysis is limited to the stars selected from a single snapshot .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to further explore the orbits of stars comprising dynamic spirals in numerical simulations for comparison with kinematic theories of stars to aid bar and spiral formation @xcite .",
    "in this study , we performed a 3d@xmath0-body / sph simulation of a barred spiral galaxy with our original @xmath0-body / sph code asura-2 @xcite and investigated the short - term evolution of grand - design spirals in barred galaxies .",
    "we summarize our main results and give implications below .    1 .",
    "as suggested by previous simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ clear _ grand - design spirals in barred galaxies appear _ only when _ the spirals connect with the ends of the bar .",
    "this implies that barred galaxies with spirals _ not _ starting from bar ends will have weaker spirals than those in barred galaxies with spirals starting from the bar ends .",
    "actually , some barred spiral galaxies exhibit a clear bar  spiral phase differences ( e.g. ngc 3124 and ngc 3450 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and their spirals are not clear grand - design spirals . yet , this is not a statistical argument .",
    "to confirm our implication , it requires a statistical comparison between barred spirals with and without the bar  spiral phase difference .",
    "grand - design spiral arms in a barred galaxy are not rigidly rotating patterns but rather differentially rotating dynamic patterns , as suggested by previous simulations @xcite .",
    "this means that the amplitudes , pitch angles , and phase speeds are not constant , but change within a time span of 12 rotational periods at each radius .",
    "such behaviour suggests that the assumption of rigidly rotating grand - design spirals is not necessarily reasonable for investigating gas flows and cloud formation in barred spiral galaxies .",
    "this point will be discussed further in baba , morokuma - matsui & saitoh ( @xcite ) and a forthcoming paper ( baba et al . in preparation ) .",
    "3 .   the stellar bar affects the evolution of spiral arms within 1.52 bar radius , and this radius is consistent with observations of barred spiral galaxies @xcite . within this radius , as predicted from the invariant manifold theory ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , low pitch angle spirals are lacking for stronger bars , although there is considerable scatter for weaker bars in the bar amplitude ",
    "spiral pitch angle plane .",
    "in addition , motions of stars located at a grand - design spiral are not simply consistent with the prediction from the invariant manifold theory .",
    "4 .   the swing amplification theory can explain the most frequent pitch angles and the amplitude  pitch angle relationships in the outer regions ( i.e. @xmath109 1.52 bar radius ) .",
    "these results imply that interplay among the galactic shearing motion , epicyclic motion of stars , and self - gravity of stars is an essential factor for the dynamics of spiral arms even in barred spiral galaxies .",
    "note that we assumed that the dm halo is a fixed external potential , so that the bar is formed via bar instabilities in massive discs @xcite .",
    "in this case , the self - gravity of the disc plays a role in the formation of spiral arms via the swing amplification .",
    "considering a ` live ' dm halo , however , @xcite showed that bars can develop even in less massive discs .",
    "we infer , then , that the spiral arms in such discs may show different behaviour from those in massive discs such as those investigated in this study . this topic will be the subject of future work .",

    "<S> we also find that the clear grand - design spirals in barred galaxies appear _ only when _ the spirals connect with the ends of the bar . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the short - term behaviour of spiral arms in the outer regions ( @xmath1 1.52 bar radius ) can be explained by the swing amplification theory and that the effects of the bar are not negligible in the inner regions ( @xmath2 1.52 bar radius ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that , although grand - design spiral arms in barred galaxies are affected by the stellar bar , the grand - design spiral arms essentially originate not as bar - driven stationary density waves , but rather as self - excited dynamic patterns . we imply that a rigidly rotating grand - design spiral could not be a reasonable dynamical model for investigating gas flows and cloud formation even in barred spiral galaxies .    </S>",
