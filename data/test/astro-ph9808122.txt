    "the long - investigated nature of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) has been mostly a matter of theoretical speculation for more than twenty years ( for a review see e.g. fishman & meegan 1995 ) .",
    "the rapid identification and accurate ( @xmath1 1 arcmin ) determination of their positions was the only way to initiate a new era in this field of astronomy .",

    "the burst was also detected by ulysses but not by batse .",
    "as for grb970228 ( costa et  al .",
    "1997a ) , thanks to a prompt observation by the _ beppo_sax  nfis , an x - ray  afterglow was identified , but , unlike that event , no detection at other wavelengths has been reported for grb970402 .",
    "in this paper we report and discuss the gamma - ray  and x - ray  results of grb970402  and its afterglow .",
    "the grbm was triggered on april 2 , 22:19:39 ut ( feroci et  al .",
    "the 40700 kev light curve showed a weak , structured burst with two major broad peaks with durations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 s respectively .",
    "analysis of the ratemeters from the wfc1 confirmed the grbm results of a burst lasting @xmath4 s ( see fig .",

    "the 210 kev burst peak flux was @xmath9 erg  @xmath6 s@xmath7  and the fluence @xmath10 erg @xmath6 with the ratios @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "spectral evolution analysis using the wfc and grbm data indicate that all the spectra can be well fitted with a single power law .",
    "the spectral photon index ( @xmath13 ) of the combined wfc + grbm data of the entire burst is almost constant at a value of @xmath14 .",
    "fitting only the wfc data gives an index of @xmath15 for the first peak and @xmath16 for the second one .",
    "the burst position derived from the wfc image was ( equinox 2000 ) r.a.=@xmath17 , decl.=@xmath18 with an error radius of 3 arcmin ( heise et  al .",
    "triangulation using ulysses and _ beppo_sax - grbm arrival times gives an annulus consistent with this position , but does not reduce the size of the error circle ( hurley et  al .",
    "1997 ) .    _",
    "beppo_sax  performed two target of opportunity ( too ) observations of grb970402  with its nfis .",
    "the first observation started on april 3.280 ut , @xmath19 hours after the burst trigger .",
    "the total exposure time was 34.5 ks in the mecs and 11.6 ks in the lecs .",
    "two sources are detected at a high statistical significance ( see fig . [",
    "fig : too12 ] ) .",
    "1sax j1450.16920  is near the center of the wfc error circle .",
    "the second serendipitous source is @xmath20 arcmin west of it and will not be investigated in this paper .",
    "grb970402  seems to lie on the eastern edge of a diffuse quasi - circular emission region .",
    "we suggest that it is an unidentified shell - like snr .",
    "persistence of the x - ray emission in the second too confirms this hypothesis .",
    "analysis of the three mecs units independently , shows that 1sax j1450.16920is only marginally detected in unit 1 .",
    "this is due to the lower sensitivity of this unit at energies below 4 kev .",
    "also the mecs unit 2 shows a more stable background respect to unit 3 , so it is more suitable for reconstructing the source position ( this is true in particular for weak and off - axis sources ) .",
    "the source position was thus obtained using the mecs2 data only giving ( equinox 2000 ) r.a.=@xmath21 , decl.=@xmath22 with a conservative error radius of 50 arcsec ( 90% confidence level ) . the position obtained with the lecs data is consistent with that of mecs2 .",
    "we computed the extraction circle giving the highest signal to noise ratio to be 24 for the mecs and @xmath23 for the lecs . for the spectral analysis , due to the presence of the snr",
    ", the standard background subtraction using blank sky maps could not be performed .",
    "for the mecs we found that a good background estimate can be derived using the second too ( longer than the first one ) , accumulating the counts in a circular annulus , centered on the source position , with radii 2448 .",
    "for the lecs we also used the data of the second too . in this case , because of the source decay , we could accumulate the background spectrum in an @xmath23 circle centered on the source but using only the data of the second part of the observation .",
    "spectral fits with a power law model for the lecs and mecs2 + 3 data together were performed .",
    "the best results were obtained using an absorbed power law . for the @xmath24",
    "we obtain only an upper limit of @xmath25 @xmath6 ( 90% confidence level , best value @xmath26@xmath6 ) .",

    "the average flux in the 210 kev mecs band is @xmath29 erg  @xmath6 s@xmath7 , while in 0.12 kev band ( lecs ) we observe a flux of @xmath30 erg  @xmath6 s@xmath7 .    _",
    "beppo_sax  performed a second observation of grb970402  on april 4.634 , @xmath31 days after the burst , lasting about 65 ks .",
    "exposure times were 54.3 ks for the mecs and 13.7 ks for the lecs .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : too12 ] , 1sax j1450.16920  is only marginally detected in the mecs .",
    "one can argue that this could be due to the underlying snr and not to the afterglow itself .",
    "we believe this is not the case because , splitting the observation into three parts , we see a statistically significant count rate decrease ; in fact we use only the first 50 ks to calculate the source flux .",
    "we obtain @xmath32 erg  @xmath6 s@xmath7  ( 210 kev ) . in the lecs ( 0.12 kev )",
    "we only can derive a @xmath33 upper limit of @xmath34 erg  @xmath6 s@xmath7 .",
    "the 210 kev light curve with @xmath35 statistical errors of the mecs , together with the wfc points corresponding to the two grb peaks , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] .",
    "the fourth bin of the first too is a @xmath33 upper limit . in spite of the low statistics in the two toos ,",
    "it is apparent that there is not a constant flux decay ; note the possible flattening after the end of the first too .",
    "we performed a least squares fit with a power law @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 time from the grb onset ) to the first too points obtaining @xmath38 in the range @xmath39 . constraining the fit with the second wfc point ( see discussion ) and",
    "also including the second too point , gives @xmath40 .",
    "this last value is considerably steeper than the @xmath41 of grb970228 ( costa et  al .",
    "1997a ) and the @xmath42 of grb970508 ( piro et  al .",
    "optical monitoring was promptly started at various sites , but failed to detect any transient object at a level of r=21.5 ( groot et  al .",
    "1997 ) , v=22.5 and i=21.7 ( pedersen et  al .",
    "moreover , two iso ( infrared space observatory ) observations performed two and twelve days after the burst did not detect any variable ir object ( castro  tirado et  al .",
    "radio observations were performed at frequencies between 1.5 and 8.6 ghz using the australia telescope compact array starting april 3 , 15:12 ut and lasting until july 3 .",
    "no radio source was discovered within the x - ray afterglow error circle ( frail 1997 ) .",
    "while the lack of an optical detection could be attributed to a high galactic extinction in this direction ( @xmath43 ) , the non - detection in the ir and radio suggests it could more likely be due to a rapid decay law .    including grb970111 ( feroci et al .",
    "1998 ) , grb970402  represents the third grb afterglow discovered at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "a comparison of the spectral and temporal behaviour of this burst in the framework of the results from the entire sample of grbs with detected afterglows is beyond the scope of this paper . a review of the spectral properties of all the grbs detected by _",
    "beppo_saxis presented by frontera et  al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "grb970402  has a peak flux in the grbm and wfc bands more than one order of magnitude lower than that of grb970228 , while their ratio @xmath11 is comparable to the 0.04 of the february event ( frontera et  al .",
    "1998a ) and to the 0.01 of grb970111 ( feroci et al .",
    "1998 ) . on the other hand",
    "the fluence ratio @xmath12 is 4 times smaller than that of grb970228 and 10 time smaller than that of grb970508 , but similar to the 0.04 of grb970111 .",
    "this could suggest some correlation with the presence or lack of an optical transient ( grb970228 and grb980508 have it , not the other two ) but at least for another burst , grb980329 , the fluence ratio is only @xmath44 ( in t zand et  al .",
    "1998 ) but an optical counterpart was detected ( palazzi et  al .  1998 ) . also , in spite of the many differences in the morphology of grb970228 and grb970402 , their 210 kev mean flux ratio @xmath45 does not change in the afterglow ( i.e. after @xmath46 hours from the high energy event ) .    from the data of the two toos alone we note",
    "that the decay is not monotonic therefore it is difficult to uniquely determine the flux decay index .",
    "however , if we fit the first too data taking into account the fourth time bin upper limit , we obtain @xmath38 in the range @xmath39 . the steeper index is obtained by setting the upper limit to its formal value decreased by @xmath47 . both these values give an extrapolated flux at the time of the grb consistent with that measured by the wfc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "this might be an indication that the grb and afterglow x - ray emission have a common origin and that , as for grb970228 , the afterglow starts some tens of seconds after the gamma - ray burst onset ( frontera et  al .",
    "if we then add the wfc flux of the second grb peak to the fit we obtain a slope @xmath48 , consistent with the range found from the first too alone .",
    "this result does not change adding the second too point to the fit .",
    "this would be the most rapid decay so far measured .",
    "simple fireball models predict a flux evolution @xmath49 with @xmath50 ( tavani 1997 ; wijers et  al .",
    "considering the two decay indices @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we obtain @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) respectively .",
    "these values are both in agreement with the @xmath57 we find from the spectral fitting of the first too . on the other hand",
    "only the first value is fully consistent with the @xmath58 of the entire grb event and @xmath59 found in the wfc data of the second peak ( @xmath60 s after the burst onset ) .",
    "so , due to the uncertainties on the flux decay index and low statistics , we do not see evidence of x - ray spectral evolution .",
    "grb970111 has a much higher flux and quite peculiar spectral evolution compared to grb970402  ( frontera et  al .",
    "however , in addition to the small @xmath61 and @xmath62 , these two bursts are remarkably similar when considering their afterglow x - ray flux of @xmath63 erg  @xmath6 s@xmath7  after @xmath64 s from the grb onset , the lack of an optical / ir / radio transient and the @xmath65 . also the two grbs profiles have similar multi - peak structure .",
    "even though the x - ray flux is not intense enough for a study with good statistical significance , the afterglow flux decay does not clearly display a constant behaviour .",
    "again at a low significance , this is also true for grb970111 and grb970228 . in the case of grb970508",
    ", the flux was ten times higher and allowed a clear demonstration of the departure from a smooth decay ( piro et  al .",
    "1998 ) of the x - ray flux ; the same was true of asca observations of grb970828 ( yoshida et  al .",
    "1997 ) . a fireball model with a highly radiative ,",
    "relativistically expanding shell ( cavallo & rees 1978 ; rees & mszros 1992 ) can not explain such behaviour unless , for example , a variable density for the surrounding environment is invoked ( vietri 1997 ) , or an asymmetric shell with temporally evolving patchy x - ray active regions ( fenimore et  al .",
    "future x - ray afterglows will determine whether ( as well could be the case ) , the non - constant fading is the rule and not the exception .",
    "this research is supported by the italian space agency ( asi ) and consiglio nazionale delle ricerche ( cnr ) .",
    "bepposax is a major program of asi with participation of the netherlands agency for aerospace programs ( nivr ) .",
