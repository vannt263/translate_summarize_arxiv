    "quantum teleportation is a quantum communication protocol where a sender , alice , aims to transmit to a receiver , bob , an unknown state of a @xmath1-dimensional quantum system ( qudit ) without sending the system itself . in the standard version of the protocol @xcite , alice and bob share two qudits in a pure and maximally entangled state ( the quantum channel ) .",
    "she then performs a joint measurement on her half of the entangled pair and the system carrying the state to be teleported .",
    "after that , she communicates the outcome of her measurement to bob through a classical channel with @xmath2 bits capacity .",
    "once bob learns alice s outcome , he performs a unitary operation on his previously entangled system , which transforms its state into the original one that alice aimed to transmit , and then the teleportation is complete .",
    "the consumption of a pure maximally entangled state and @xmath2 bits of classical communication are both necessary and sufficient conditions for deterministic and faithful teleportation @xcite , which means that alice transmits a quantum state to bob with unit probability of success and unity fidelity .",
    "when alice and bob share a pure but _ nonmaximally _ two - qudit entangled state , deterministic _ and _ faithful teleportation is no longer possible .- dimensional systems with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this case will not be addressed here . ]",
    "the best they can do is to teleport in a optimal way according to some figure(s ) of merit ( e.g. , average teleportation fidelity , probability of successful teleportation and classical communication cost ) . in this regard , many optimized schemes have been suggested to implement quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "for instance , to obtain the optimal average teleportation fidelity deterministically , alice and bob have just to perform the standard protocol @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is crucial for bob to receive from alice a perfect replica of an unknown qudit state , they can resort to the so - called _ perfect conclusive teleportation _ @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "faithful teleportation is possible with less than unity probability of success and the optimal protocol is the one that maximizes such probability .",
    "so far , several strategies have been proposed to implement the optimal protocol @xcite . in particular , for the purposes of the present work , we highlight the strategy of ref .",
    "@xcite where it is shown that to accomplish perfect conclusive teleportation in a optimal way , alice must implement an optimized measurement which discriminates unambiguously between a set of linearly _ independent _ and equally likely symmetric states @xcite .",
    "perfect conclusive teleportation applies only for a quantum channel with maximal schmidt rank @xcite - dimensional systems its maximum value is @xmath1 .",
    "[ fn : schmidt ] ] . in this article",
    "we investigate the problem of teleporting via nonmaximally entangled states with _",
    "schmidt rank . since the success probability of faithful teleportation is zero in this case , we design an optimal _ imperfect conclusive teleportation _ protocol which can be summarized as follows : alice tries to teleport an unknown qudit state to bob and succeeds with the maximum achievable probability . when she succeeds , the teleportation fidelity , although less than unit , is also the maximum achievable for their shared quantum channel .",
    "such fidelity depends only on the schmidt rank of this channel and it is larger than the optimal one achieved , deterministically , by the standard protocol @xcite .",
    "this is relevant , for instance , in a scenario where it is sufficient for alice s and bob s purposes to teleport with a fidelity above some threshold and their quantum channel allows this only in a probabilistic way .",
    "similarly to the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite for quantum channels with maximal schmidt rank , we shall see here that if this number is not maximal , in the course of the teleportation process alice is faced with the problem of discriminating among nonorthogonal symmetric states which are linearly _ dependent _ and equally likely .",
    "then , we show that by implementing an optimized maximum - confidence ( mc ) measurement @xcite to accomplish this task , she can perform the optimal imperfect conclusive teleportation as described above .",
    "the mc discrimination for the aforementioned set of states was studied recently @xcite .",
    "specifically , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have found the optimal positive operator valued measure ( povm ) that maximizes our confidence in identifying each state in the set and minimizes the probability of obtaining inconclusive results .",
    "we also showed that after an inconclusive result , the input states are mapped into a new set of equiprobable symmetric states within a lower - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "if such space is not one dimensional , this new set could be submitted to another round of mc measurements , with which we could still gain some information about the input states , although with less confidence than before .",
    "this process can be repeated in as many stages as allowed by the input states , and we called it _ sequential maximum - confidence _ ( smc ) measurements .",
    "applying smc measurements to our imperfect conclusive teleportation protocol , we shall see that the number of stages that alice is allowed to implement , depends on both the schmidt rank and schmidt coefficients of the quantum channel , which she and bob know in advance .",
    "we then show that there are quantum channels for which it is possible to implement a @xmath0-stage smc measurement ( @xmath4 ) such that conclusive events at any stage lead to a teleportation fidelity above the optimal one achieved by the standard protocol @xcite . in this case",
    ", there will be an increase of the overall probability of teleportation with a fidelity above that limit and , consequently , alice and bob will be able to save resources for accomplishing the protocol , as we shall discuss later .",
    "we shall as well discuss some side effects of our protocol , as for instance , the requirement of ancillary systems , the increase in the classical communication cost , and the reduction of the overall teleportation fidelity ( which involves conclusive and inconclusive events ) when compared with the one achieved by the optimal deterministic protocol .",

    "we shall see that an optimal deterministic protocol and a probabilistic and faithful one can be associated with minimum - error and unambiguous discrimination strategies , respectively ( reminding that the latter case is a known result @xcite ) .",

    "more specifically , we showed that a crucial step for teleportation is related to the ability of the sending party , alice , to discriminate nonorthogonal symmetric states which are equally likely .",
    "the type of teleportation that she and bob ( the receiving party ) prearrange to implement defines the discrimination strategy that she has to adopt . in this regard",
    ", we have shown that to achieve optimal teleportation fidelity in a deterministic way @xcite , alice must implement an optimized me strategy , which is valid for both linearly dependent and linearly independent symmetric states . on the other hand , to achieve unit teleportation fidelity with maximum success probability , alice has to apply an optimized ud strategy .",
    "this is a known fact since this protocol , called perfect conclusive teleportation , has been conceived @xcite and intensively studied thereafter @xcite .",
    "however , ud applies only for linearly independent states @xcite , which implies that perfect conclusive teleportation is restricted to quantum channels with maximal schmidt rank . here , we investigated the problem where this latter condition does not hold .",
    "it was shown that if alice applies an optimized mc measurement @xcite to assist teleportation in this case , the fidelity of transmission at conclusive events , although less than unit , is the maximum achievable for that channel .",
    "in fact , as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ strategy - conclusive ] ) and ( [ eq : fmc - vs - fme ] ) , we found that this fidelity depends only on the schmidt rank of the channel and it is better than the one achieved deterministically via me measurements .",
    "moreover , the probability of successfully teleporting is also maximal .",
    "this optimal imperfect conclusive teleportation was shown to interpolate between the optimal deterministic ( when the schmidt coefficients are all equal ) and the perfect conclusive ( when the schmidt rank is maximal ) protocols .",
    "subsequently , the teleportation via smc measurements , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , has also been investigated . in this strategy ,",
    "one takes into account that it might be possible to extract some information about the input states even after an inconclusive result in the mc measurement .",
    "if so , mc can be applied again and the process can be iterated until no further information is available .",
    "we have shown that if the quantum channel allows for the maximum of @xmath149 conclusive stages in the smc measurement , the teleportation fidelity decreases from one stage to the next as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fid_con_a ] ) ; at the @xmath149th stage , it is still always larger than the maximal fidelity achieved via classical channel .",
    "an important feature of this scheme is that there are quantum channels for which it is possible to implement @xmath82 among the @xmath149 allowed stages in the smc measurement such that a conclusive event at any stage leads to a teleportation fidelity above the optimal one achieved deterministically . as a consequence , the overall probability of teleportation increases , allowing alice and bob to save the resources used in the protocol .",
    "it is worth noting that smc measurements could also be applied after a failed attempt of perfect conclusive teleportation , since in this case the states to be discriminated becomes linearly dependent and can not be unambiguously identified by any further process .    in this work",
    "we have shown that the singlet fraction of a _ pure _ bipartite quantum channel , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : singlet - fraction ] ) , is equal to the maximum confidence with which alice can discriminate equally likely symmetric pure states by applying a given optimized measurement strategy .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the connection between singlet fraction and entanglement concentration procedures @xcite , and the connection between the latter and state discrimination @xcite .",
    "it may be fruitful , somehow , to look at the singlet fraction by this new perspective and , for instance , to extend our study here for teleportation via mixed entangled states .",
    "finally , another possible extension of the results obtained in this work is to investigate other quantum communication protocols performed via quantum channels with nonmaximal schmidt rank .",
    "for instance , perfect conclusive entanglement swapping via ud strategy has been studied in @xcite , and in a forthcoming paper we shall generalize this for an imperfect protocol accomplished via mc measurements .        the maximum number of conclusive stages allowed in the smc measurement , i.e. , the number of stages in which it is possible to gain some information about the input states through a measurement , ranges from 1 to @xmath194 .",
    "it depends on the multiplicities of the input - state coefficients @xmath195 as follows .",
    "the @xmath15 coefficients @xmath36 can be grouped into @xmath196 sets of equal coefficients , where @xmath148 $ ] .",
    "the number of elements in each set gives the multiplicity of the coefficient .",
    "if @xmath147 ( with @xmath197 ) is the multiplicity of the @xmath95th smallest coefficient , then @xmath151 will be the multiplicity of the largest one . as we saw in sec .",
    "[ subsec : smc ] , after each stage of the smc measurement , the dimension of the subspace where the states to be discriminated are restricted , decreases . if there are @xmath196 sets of equal input - state coefficients , the dimension of the hilbert space at each stage will be @xmath198 2^{\\rm nd}\\ \\text{stage } & & \\rightarrow & & n-\\mu_1 , \\\\[2 mm ] 3^{\\rm rd}\\ \\text{stage } & & \\rightarrow & & n-(\\mu_1+\\mu_2 ) , \\\\[2 mm ] \\vdots   & & & & \\hspace{8mm}\\vdots \\\\[2 mm ] % ( d-1)^{\\rm th}\\ \\text{stage } & & \\rightarrow & & n-\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^{d-2}\\mu_j=\\mu_{d-1}+\\mu_d , \\\\[3 mm ]   d^{\\rm th}\\ \\text{stage } & & \\rightarrow & & n-\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^{d-1}\\mu_j=\\mu_d .   \\end{array}\\ ] ] we note that if @xmath199 the failure states in the last stage will be identical , up to a global phase , so no further measurement allows us to gain information about the input states .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath200 the failure states can be discriminated for the last time .",
    "in this case , mc and me strategies coincide and there is no further inconclusive result .",
    "therefore , the maximum number of conclusive stages in the smc measurement , denoted by @xmath149 , will be @xmath201 \\mathbbm{m}=d , & & \\text{if } & & \\mu_d>1 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] which , for short , can be written as @xmath202 . in the extreme cases mentioned above",
    ", this will be 1 when @xmath203 ( i.e. , all coefficients @xmath36 are equal ) and @xmath194 when @xmath204 ( i.e. , all coefficients @xmath36 differ ) ."
