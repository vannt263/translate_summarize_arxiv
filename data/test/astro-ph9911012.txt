    "during the recent gregorian upgrade of the arecibo telescope , considerable effort was put into drift scan searches of the arecibo sky ( @xmath0 ) for new pulsars .",
    "the stsci / naic group was assigned declination strips centered at 1.5@xmath1 , 6.5@xmath1 , 11.5@xmath1 , 16.5@xmath1 , 21.5@xmath1 , 26.5@xmath1 , 31.5@xmath1 , and 36.5@xmath1 .",
    "a list of 20 candidates was compiled from a search in these areas between 1994 and 1998 .",
    "we have so far confirmed eight new pulsars as a result of these observations .",
    "the nominal parameters based on the confirmation observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "barycentric periods have uncertainties of order one unit in the last digit quoted , while a conservative estimate of the uncertainty in the dispersion measures ( dm ) is @xmath2 @xmath3 pc .",
    "the positions are presently uncertain by of order @xmath4 arcmin in right ascension and declination  equivalent to the half power beam size of the telescope at 430 mhz .",
    "although we presently have no long - term estimates of the flux densities of the new pulsars , it is already clear that they are weak sources with typical flux densities of order 0.5 to 1 mjy .",
    "some of the initial detections were probably significantly facilitated by flux amplifications due to interstellar scintillation .",
    "inferred 430-mhz luminosities , based on their fluxes and dispersion measures estimates range between 3 and 30 mjy kpc@xmath5 .",
    "these pulsars , along with those discovered by other groups during the arecibo upgrade , should greatly assist future statistical studies of the low end of the pulsar luminosity function .",
    "more accurate measurements of the flux densities , as well as the spin and astrometric parameters for each source are presently underway at arecibo as part of a regular timing program using the penn state pulsar machine .    llllll psr & r.a . & decl . & period & epoch & dm + & & ( sec ) & ( mjd ) & @xmath3 pc + j0137 + 16 & 01:37:31 & + 16:55 & 0.41477 & 51264 & 26 + j0329 + 16 & 03:29:13 & + 16:54 & 0.8933 & 51257 & 35 +   + j1549 + 21 & 15:49:41 & + 21:14 & 1.262 & 51335 & 55 + j1822 + 11 & 18:22:17 & + 11:22 & 1.787 & 51261 & 112 +   + j1838 + 16 & 18:38:52 & + 16:53 & 1.902 & 51261 & 36 + j1849 + 06 & 18:49:07 & + 06:07 & 2.219 & 51258 & 236 +   + j1905 + 06 & 19:05:21 & + 06:23 & 0.9897 & 51261 & 262 + j2040 + 16 & 20:40:13 & + 16:54 & 0.8656 & 51261 & 51 +"
