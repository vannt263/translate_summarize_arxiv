    "the high - energy transient swift j164449.3 + 573451 ( hereafter sw j1644 + 57 ) was detected by swift burst alert telescope ( bat ) on march 28 , 2011 ( burrows et al .",
    "it was considered as a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) in the beginning . however , sw j1644 + 57 has later shown many different characters from grbs and from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) as well .",
    "it has a lifetime much longer than grbs and is much more luminous than agns .",
    "further observations show that the position of this event is coincident with the nucleus of a galaxy at redshift @xmath0 ( levan et al .",
    "2011 ; bloom et al . 2011 ) .",
    "its long - term x - ray luminosity varies as @xmath1 , consistent with the expected fallback rate of the tidally disrupted material ( rees 1998 ) .",
    "thus this event was later considered as a star being tidally disrupted by a @xmath2 supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in the center of the galaxy . since the @xmath3-ray and x - ray luminosity of this event is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude larger than the eddington luminosity of a @xmath4 smbh , the emission is likely to be produced by a collimated outflow .",
    "it is worth noting that sw j1644 + 57 has a bright long term radio synchrotron emission ( zauderer et al .",
    "2011 ) , which provide a unique chance for us to study how the physical parameters of the outflow evolve as it interacts with the ambient medium .",
    "metzger et al . ( 2012 ) modeled the radio - microwave emission during 5 - 23 days after the trigger with the blast wave emission , in analogy to grb afterglows ( see e.g. giannios & metzger 2011 ) .",
    "they find that a narrow jet of an opening angle of @xmath5 expanding into a medium with a density profile @xmath6 could fit the radio data .",
    "berger et al . ( 2012 ) reconsidered this model based on much longer radio data during 5 - 216 days .",
    "they noticed that the energy injection model used in metzger et al.(2011 ) is no longer suitable after 23 days .",
    "instead they made an assumption that the energy distribution in the ejecta is described by @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the bulk lorentz factor of the ejecta ) , so that substantial energy is added into the blast wave at later times .",
    "the radial density profile after 23 days is inferred to be @xmath9 with a plateau at @xmath10 .",
    "both works made a pre - assumption that the jet has a conical structure with a constant opening angle @xmath11 .",
    "however the jet structure of this transient has not been resolved yet .",
    "the cross sections of extragalactic agn radio jets do not increase at large radii and cylindrical jet structure ( or blob ) has been usually assumed ( bridle & perley 1984 ) . since sw j1644 + 57 involves a jet from a smbh similar to an agn , it is necessary to consider the possibility of a cylindrical jet . in this paper",
    "we first present an approach to calculate the parameters of the jet blast wave at any instantaneous time directly by using the radiation spectrum at that time (  2 ) .",
    "this approach applies to both conical and cylindrical jets .",
    "then , using these parameters , we calculate the jet cross section of sw j1644 + 57 at different times and study how it evolves as the jet propagates outward (  3 ) .",
    "we find that the outflow gradually transits from a conical jet to a cylindrical one at later times . the possible mechanism for the collimation is further discussed (  3.2 ) .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions (  4 ) .",
    "in our model , the radio afterglow of sw j1644 + 57 is produced by electrons accelerated by the forward shock that forms as the jet interacts with the ambient medium .",
    "the radiation can be simply described by a cloud of relativistic electrons radiating synchrotron emission in the magnetic fields , so it is completely determined by the following parameters : the total number of radiating electrons @xmath12 , the bulk motion lorentz factor @xmath8 , the magnetic field @xmath13 , the thermal lorentz factor of electrons @xmath14 and power - law distribution index @xmath15 .",
    "we made the same assumption that @xmath11 in the conical jet case , so the parameter @xmath16 is not involved .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor relates with the jet energy @xmath17 through @xmath18 assuming that the magnetic field energy density is a factor @xmath19 of the shock internal energy , the magnetic field related with the number density of the ambient medium @xmath20 through @xmath21 the minimum energy of the accelerated power - law electrons is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the equipartition factors of electron energy density .",
    "the radio synchrotron emission produced by the power - law electrons can be described by three characteristic quantities , i.e. the typical frequency @xmath24 , the self - absorption frequency @xmath25 and the peak flux @xmath26 ( sari et al .",
    "the two break frequencies are , respectively , given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( wu et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the emission radius @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the observer time .    in a relativistic cylindrical jet , the radiation emitted by electrons",
    "is distributed over a solid angle of @xmath33 .",
    "the peak flux can be obtained by calculating the total emission of radiating electrons @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the peak spectral power ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ) , so the observed peak flux density is @xmath36 on the other hand , for a conical jet with @xmath37 , the observed peak flux density can be written as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the equivalent isotropic electron number , which relates with the real number of electrons @xmath12 by @xmath40 substituting @xmath39 in equation ( 9 ) into equation ( 8) , we find that the expressions for the peak flux are the same for both cylindrical and conical jet models .",
    "thus equations ( 4)-(7 ) apply to both cylindrical and conical jets .",
    "equations ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) can be rewritten as explicit expressions of five independent parameters @xmath19 , @xmath23 , @xmath12 , @xmath20 , and @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are three constant coefficients . after setting typical values for @xmath19 and @xmath23 ( for instance , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 )",
    ", we can solve the other three quantities @xmath12 , @xmath20 , @xmath17 , using the radio spectral data at different times .",
    "once we know the evolution of @xmath12 , @xmath20 , @xmath17 with the observer time @xmath32 , we can obtain @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 with the assistance of equations ( 1 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "now we confront the above model with the observational data of sw j1644 + 57 .",
    "we adopt the observational radio data of sw j1644 + 57 from berger et al .",
    "1 shows our fit of the radio spectral data with the synchrotron broken power - law .",
    "we find that the favorable value for the power - law index is @xmath52 .",
    "the self - absorption frequency @xmath25 is always below the typical frequency @xmath24 during the observation period .",
    "table 1 summarizes the characteristic quantities of the broken power - law spectra at different times for sw j1644 + 57 . with these data",
    ", we can get the characteristic parameters , such as @xmath8 , @xmath20 and @xmath30 , at different times without assuming the blast wave dynamics beforehand , i.e. we do not need to assume the ambient density profile or energy injection mode .",
    "because the spectral data during 36 - 68 days are incomplete , we could only get the spectral quantities @xmath25 and @xmath53 . with these quantities",
    "the jet energy @xmath17 can be obtained precisely , while we can only get upper limits for the ambient density @xmath20 and the total number of radiating electrons @xmath12 .",
    "however , as will be mentioned below , the lorentz factor of the ejecta may be constant during 23 - 216 days .",
    "if we take the assumption that the lorentz factor during 36 - 68 days is a constant , e.g. @xmath54 , the values of @xmath20 and @xmath12 can be obtained .",
    "we show the evolution of the parameter @xmath55 , @xmath51 , @xmath50 and @xmath49 in figure 2 .",
    "the jet energy of sw j1644 + 57 evolves as @xmath56 during 5 - 23 days ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , @xmath57 at later times , and after 126 days @xmath56 again .",
    "this indicates that sw j1644 + 57 has a continuous energy injection lasting much longer than previous thought .",
    "the swift xrt data of sw j1644 + 57 obey the power - law decay @xmath58 .",
    "such a slow energy injection is insufficient to account for the required energy increase , so an extra or new energy supply mechanism should be needed . in figure 2(b ) we can see that the ambient density profile varies as @xmath59 , which is consistent with the prediction by the bondi accretion as suggested by berger et al .",
    "the radius of the jet displayed in figure 2(c ) evolves as @xmath60 during 23 - 216 days and @xmath61 during 5 - 23 days . since @xmath62",
    ", this relation indicates that the lorentz factor of the ejecta varies as @xmath63 during 5 - 23 days and remains almost constant ( @xmath64 ) during 23 - 216 days .",
    "this behavior is clearly seen in figure 2(d ) .",
    "this is the reason why we assume @xmath54 during 36 - 68 days in the calculation .",
    "the above equations apply to both conical and cylindrical jets .",
    "however , the structure could be known if we know how the cross section of the jet evolves as the radius @xmath30 increases .",
    "the size of the cross section can be derived from the evolution of @xmath12 , @xmath20 and @xmath30 .",
    "since the total number of swept - up electrons by the jet relates with the cross section radius through @xmath65 we can derive the cross section radius by @xmath66 to obtain @xmath67 , we first find an empirical function to fit the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath30 , and then calculate the differential coefficient .",
    "the result is shown in figure 3 .",
    "we find that when @xmath30 is smaller than a few @xmath68 , the jet cross section evolved as a conical jet with @xmath69 , which is consistent with the result obtained by metzger et al .",
    "however at larger radii ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath71 increase slowly and it tends to become a constant ( i.e. @xmath72 ) , which indicates that the jet may transit to a cylindrical structure .",
    "the transition may be due to the collimation of the jet by the surrounding cocoon which forms while the jet is propagating in the ambient medium ( bromberg et al .",
    "such a mechanism has been discussed in long - lived agn jets ( begelman & cioffi 1989 ) , as well as in microquasar jets and grb jets ( bromberg et al . 2011 ) . in this mechanism ,",
    "matter in the jet head is heated and flows sideways due to its higher pressure than the ambient medium , which leads to the formation of a pressured cocoon around the jet .",
    "if the cocoon pressure is sufficiently high , it collimates the jet and reduces its opening angle .",
    "thus a jet can be conical initially and transit to a cylindrical jet at later times .",
    "bromberg et al . ( 2011 ) find the condition under which the jet will be collimated : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a dimensionless parameter that defines the ratio between the energy density of the jet and the rest - mass energy density of the surrounding medium at the location of the head , @xmath75 is the jet luminosity , @xmath76 is the jet cross section , @xmath77 is the ambient medium density , and @xmath78 is the initial opening angle of jet .",
    "this condition gives a critic transition radius at @xmath79 above which the jet becomes collimated and transits to a cylindrical jet .    for the case of sw j1644 + 57",
    ", we can obtain the critic transition radius by taking @xmath80 , @xmath81 and assuming a typical initial opening angle of @xmath82 . figure 4",
    "shows the critic radius @xmath83 as a function of time ( the dotted line ) .",
    "it clearly shows the critic radius approaches the jet radius at late times , which means that jet tends to be collimated at later times .",
    "the transition radius is @xmath84 , which roughly ( within a factor of a few ) agrees with the above result obtained by modeling of the radio spectral data ( fig .",
    "the fact that the jet in a tidal disruption event transits from conical to cylindrical structure in a way similar to long - lived agn jets provides independent support that sw j1644 + 57 may result from the onset of an agn .",
    "the structure of the jets in tidal disrupted flares such as sw j1644 + 57 , whether it is conical as usually assumed in grb jets or cylindrical as seen in some extragalactic radio jets , is largely unknown .",
    "we propose that the long - term radio data can be used to probe the jet structure . by fitting the observed radio data of sw j1644 + 57",
    ", we find that the jet structure of sw j1644 + 57 undergos a transition from a conical jet to a cylindrical one at tens of days after the initial flare .",
    "it is natural to expect that the jets are initially conical and later become cylindrical due to collimation by the surrounding cocoon .",
    "observations of extragalactic radio agn jets show that the jets are indeed cylindrical on large scales .",
    "the similar processes occurring in agns and sw j1644 + 57 may possibly indicate that sw j1644 + 57 also arise from accretion process in a supermassive black hole , likely feeded by the tidally captured stellar material .",
