    "investigation of the rare decays described by the @xmath5 transitions represents one of the main directions of high energy physics .",
    "the attractive property of these decays is that they are forbidden at tree level in the standard model ( sm ) and appear only at loop level",
    ". therefore these decays are quite promising for checking gauge structure of the theory at quantum level .",
    "these decays are also excellent candidates in search of new physics beyond the sm .",

    "exclusive @xmath7 , @xmath8 decays in baryonic sector , which are described by @xmath9 transition are also very interesting .",
    "the main advantage of these baryonic decays is that , unlike mesonic decays , they can give information about the helicity structure of the effective hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the baryonic decays @xmath7 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 induced by the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) are studied comprehensively in many works @xcite .",
    "the first step in experimental investigation of rare baryonic decays has recently been taken by the cdf collaboration , and they announced the observation of the baryonic rare @xmath12 decay .",

    "the experimental observation of this decay has stimulated researches for a more refined theoretical analysis of this subject .    as has already been noted ,",
