    "eighteenth century europe is referred to as the age of enlightenment , a period when prominent thinkers began to question traditional forms of authority and power and the moral standards that supported these forms .",
    "one of the most significant and enduring contributions of the time was the notion that a government s existence should be predicated on protecting and supporting the natural , immutable rights of its citizens . among these rights",
    "are the right to self - governance , autonomy of thought , and equality .",
    "the inherent virtue of these ideas forced many european nations to relinquish time - honored aristocratic and monarchic systems .",
    "moreover , it was the philosophy of the enlightenment that inspired the formalization of a governing structure that would define a new nation : the united states of america .",
    "natural rights exposed during the enlightenment are immutable .",
    "that is , they are rights not granted by the government , but instead are rights inherent to man .",
    "however , the systems that maintain and support these rights merit no such permanence . while modern democratic governments strive to achieve the ideals of the enlightenment , it is put forth that governments can better serve them by making greater use of the technological advances of the present day information age . the technological infrastructure that now supports modern nations removes the physical restrictions that dictated many of the design choices of these early government architects . as such , many of today s government structures are remnants of the technological constraints of the eighteenth century .",
    "modern nations have an obligation to improve their systems so as to better ensure the fulfillment of the rights of man .",
    "inscribed at the jefferson memorial is this statement by thomas jefferson ( american : 17431826 ) , another thinker of the enlightenment :  [ ... ] institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind .",
    "as that becomes more developed , more enlightened [ ... ] institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times . \" to move in this direction , the principle of citizen representation as articulated by thomas paine ( english : 17371809 ) and the principle of competitive actors for the common good as articulated by adam smith ( scottish : 17231790 ) are considered from a techno - social , collective decision making systems perspective . moreover",
    ", the rationale for these principles can be understood within the mathematical formulations of marquis de condorcet s ( french : 17431794 ) requirements for optimal decision making .",
    "marquis de condorcet ( portrayed in figure [ fig : condorcet - portrait ] ) ardently supported equal rights and free and universal public education .",
    "these ideals were driven as much by his ethics as they were by his mathematical investigations into the requirements for optimal decision making .     a portrait of marquis de condorcet .",
    "this is a public domain photograph courtesy of wikimedia commons.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    one of his most famous results is the condorcet statement and its associated theorem . in his 1785",
    "_ essai sur lapplication de lanalyse aux probabilits des decisions prises  la pluralit des voix _ ( english translation : _ essay on the application of analysis to the probability of majority decisions _ ) , condorcet states that when a group of  enlightened \" decision makers chooses between two options under a majority rule , then as the size of the decision making population tends toward infinity , it becomes a certainty that the best choice is rendered @xcite .",
    "the first statistical proof of this statement is the condorcet jury theorem .",
    "the model is expressed as follows .",
    "imagine there exists @xmath0 independent decision makers and each decision maker has a probability @xmath1 $ ] of choosing the best of two options in a decision .",
    "if @xmath2 , meaning that each individual decision maker is enlightened , and as @xmath3 , the probability of a majority vote outcome rendering the best decision approaches certainty at @xmath4 .",
    "this is known as the  light side \" of the condorcet jury theorem . the  dark side \" of the theorem states that if @xmath5 and as @xmath3 , the probability of a majority vote outcome rendering the best decision approaches @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig : condorcet ] plots the relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath0 , where the gray scale values denote a range from 100% probability of the group rendering the best decision ( white ) to a 0% probability ( black ) .",
    "the relationship between @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath8 according to the condorcet jury theorem model .",
    "darker values represent a lower probability of a majority vote rendering the best decision and the lighter values represent a higher probability of a majority vote rendering the best decision.,scaledwidth=48.5% ]    the condorcet jury theorem is one of the original formal justifications for the application of democratic principles to government . while the theorem does not reveal any startling conditions for a successful democracy , it does distill the necessary conditions to two variables ( under simple assumptions ) .",
    "if a decision making group has a large @xmath0 and a @xmath2 , then the group is increasing its chances of optimal decision making .",
    "unfortunately , the theorem does not suggest a means to achieve these conditions , though in practice many mechanisms do exist that strive to meet them .",
    "for instance , democracies do not rely on a single decision maker , but instead use senates , parliaments , and referendums to increase the size of their voting population .",
    "moreover , for general elections , equal voting rights facilitate large citizen participation . furthermore , democratic nations tend to promote universal public education so as to ensure that competent leaders are chosen from and by an enlightened populace .",
    "it is noted that the practices employed by democratic nations to ensure competent decision making are implementation choices , and a society must not value the implementation of its government .",
    "tradition must be forgone if another implementation would serve better .",
    "implementations of government should be altered and amended so as to better realize the ideals of the nation .",
    "technology - enabled social algorithms may provide a means by which to reliably achieve the conditions of the  light \" side of the condorcet jury theorem , thus ensuring optimal decision making .",
    "furthermore , modern algorithms have the potential to do so in a manner that better honors the right of each citizen to participate in government decision making as such algorithms are not constrained by eighteenth century technology .",
    "present day social algorithms , in the form of information retrieval and recommendation services , already contribute significantly to the augmentation of human and social intelligence @xcite . in line with these developments , this article presents two social algorithms that show promise as mechanisms for governance - based collective decision making .",
    "one algorithm exaggerates thomas paine s citizen representation in order to accurately simulate the behavior of a large decision making population ( @xmath3 ) , and the other employs adam smith s market philosophy to induce participation by the enlightened within that population ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "both algorithms utilize the condorcet jury theorem to the society s advantage .",
    "an oil portrait of thomas paine painted by auguste millire in 1880 .",
    "this is a public domain photograph courtesy of wikimedia commons.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    thomas paine ( portrayed in figure [ fig : paine - portrait ] ) was born in england , but in his middle years , he relocated to america on the recommendation of benjamin franklin .",
    "it was in america , in the time leading up to the american revolution , that his enlightened ideals were well received . in 1776 ,",
    "the year in which the declaration of independence was written , thomas paine wrote a widely distributed pamphlet entitled _ common sense _ which outlined the values of a democratic society @xcite .",
    "this pamphlet discussed the equality of man and the necessity for all those at stake to partake in the decision making processes of the group .",
    "as a formal justification of this value , the condorcet jury theorem would hold that a direct democracy would be the most likely democracy to yield optimal decisions as the voting population is the largest it can possibly be for a nation . in practice ,",
    "the desire for a direct democracy is tempered by the tremendous burden that constant voting would impinge on citizens ( not to mention the logistical problems such a model would incur within present day voting infrastructures ) .",
    "for this reason , representation is required .",
    "thomas paine states that when populations are small  some convenient tree will afford them a state house \" , but as the population increases it becomes a necessity for representatives to act on behalf of their constituents .",
    "moreover , the central tenet of political representation is that representatives  act in the same manner as the whole body would act were they present . \"",
    "the remainder of this section presents a social algorithm that simulates the manner in which the whole population would act without requiring pre - elected , long - standing representatives .    assuming a two - option majority rule , an individual citizen s judgement can be placed along a continuum between the two options such that the  political tendency \" of citizen @xmath10 is denoted @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "for example , given united states politics , a political tendency of @xmath12 represents a fully republican perspective , a tendency of @xmath13 represents a fully democratic perspective , and a tendency of @xmath14 denotes a moderate . given this definition ,",
    "there are two ways to quantify the population as a whole .",
    "one way is to calculate the average tendency of all citizens .",
    "that is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 $ ] is the collective tendency of the population .",
    "given a uniform distribution of political tendency within @xmath17 , the collective tendency approaches @xmath14 as the size of the population increases toward infinity .",
    "the other way to quantify the group is to require that the citizen s tendency be reduced to a binary option ( i.e.  a two option vote ) .",
    "if a citizen has a political tendency that is less than @xmath14 , then they will vote @xmath12 . for a tendency greater than @xmath14 , they will vote @xmath13 .",
    "if they have a tendency equal to @xmath14 then a fair coin toss will determine their vote .",
    "this majority wins vote is denoted @xmath18 .",
    "imagine a direct democracy in the purest sense , where a raise of hands or a shout of voices is replaced by an internet architecture and a sophisticated error- and fraud - proof ballot system .",
    "all citizens have the potential to vote on any decisions they wish ; if they can not vote on a particular decision for whatever reason , they abstain from participating . in practice , not",
    "every decision will be voted on by all @xmath0 citizens .",
    "citizens will be constrained by time pressures to only participate in those votes in which they are most informed or most passionate .",

    "citizen participation wanes , the ability for the remaining , active participants to reflect the tendency of the whole becomes more difficult .",

    "the algorithm reflects the primary tenet of representation as originally outlined by thomas paine . the argument for the use of the algorithm as a mechanism for representation goes as follows .",
    "not everyone in a population needs to vote as others in that same population more than likely have a nearly identical political tendency and thus , identical vote .",
    "what does need to be recorded is the frequency of that sentiment in the population .",
    "if an active , voting citizen is similar in tendency to @xmath27 non - active citizens , then the active citizen s ballot can be weighted by @xmath27 to reflect the tendencies of the non - participating citizens .",
    "dynamically distributed democracy accomplishes this weighting through a similarity- or trust - based social network that is used to propagate voting  power \" to active voters so as to mitigate the error incurred by waning citizen participation .",
    "as previously stated , let @xmath28^n$ ] denote the political tendency of each citizen in this population , where @xmath29 is the tendency of citizen @xmath10 and , for the purpose of simulation , is determined from a uniform distribution .",
    "assume that every citizen in a population of @xmath0 citizens uses some social network - based system to create links to those individuals that they believe reflect their tendency the best .",
    "in practice , these links may point to a close friend , a relative , or some public figure whose political tendencies resonate with the individual .",
    "in other words , representatives are any citizens , not political candidates that serve in public office .",
    "let @xmath30^{n \\times n}$ ] denote the link matrix representing the network , where the weight of an edge , for the purpose of simulation , is denoted @xmath31 in words , if two linked citizens are identical in their political tendency , then the strength of the link is @xmath4 .",
    "if their tendencies are completely opposing , then their trust ( and the strength of the link ) is @xmath6 . note that a preferential attachment network growth algorithm is used to generate a degree distribution that is reflective of typical social networks  in the wild \" ( i.e.  scale - free properties ) .",
    "moreover , an assortativity parameter is used to bias the connections in the network towards citizens with similar tendencies .",
    "the assumption here is that given a system of this nature , it is more likely for citizens to create links to similar - minded individuals than to those whose opinions are quite different .",
    "the resultant link matrix @xmath32 is then normalized to be row stochastic in order to generate a probability distribution over the weights of the outgoing edges of a citizen .",

    "each citizen s color denotes their  political tendency \" , where full red is @xmath12 , full blue is @xmath13 , and purple is @xmath14 .",
    "the layout algorithm chosen is the fruchterman - reingold layout.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    given this social network infrastructure , it is possible to better ensure that the collective tendency and vote is appropriately represented through a weighting of the active , participating population",

    "the values of @xmath40 are biased by an unfair coin that has probability @xmath23 of making the citizen an active participant and @xmath41 of making the citizen inactive .",
    "the iterative algorithm is presented below , where @xmath42 denotes entry - wise multiplication and @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44    in words , active citizens serve as vote power",
    " sinks \" in that once they receive vote power , from themselves or from a neighbor in the network , they do not pass it on .",
    "inactive citizens serve as vote power  sources \" in that they propagate their vote power over the network links to their neighbors iteratively until all ( or @xmath45 ) vote power has reached active citizens . at this point , the tendency in the active population is defined as @xmath46 .",
    "figure [ fig : tendency ] plots the error incurred using dynamically distributed democracy ( black line ) , where the error is defined as @xmath47 next , the collective vote @xmath48 is determined by a weighted majority as dictated by the vote power accumulated by active participants .",
    "figure [ fig : vote ] plots the proportion of votes that are different from what a fully participating population would have rendered ( black line ) .",
    "in essence , if a citizen , for any reason , is unable to participate in a decision making process , then they may abstain from participating knowing that the underlying social network will accurately distribute their vote power to their neighbor or neighbor s neighbor . in this way , representation is dynamic , distributed , and democratic .",
    "thomas paine outlines that representatives should maintain  fidelity to the public \" and believes this is accomplished through frequent elections @xcite .",

    "moreover , if a selected representative falters in their ability to represent a citizen , incoming links can be immediately retracted from them .",
    "such an architecture turns the representative s status from that of elected public official to that of a self - intentioned citizen .",
    "while many countries have political institutions that are set up according to a left , right , and moderate agenda , the individual perspectives of a citizen may be more complex .",
    "in many cases , a citizen s political tendency may only be amenable to a multi - dimensional representation . in a multi - relational social network ,",
    "the links are augmented with labels in order to denote the type of trust one citizen has for another . in this way ,",
    "voting power propagates over the links in a manner that is biased to the domain of the decision .",
    "for example , citizen @xmath10 may trust citizen @xmath49 in the domain of  education \" but not in the domain of  health care \" .",
    "this design has been articulated in @xcite . supporting systems , including the means by which ballots are proposed and issues are discussed , is presented in @xcite .    with the internet , supporting web technologies , and dynamically distributed democracy , it is possible to dynamically determine a representative - layer of government that accurately reflects a full direct democracy . in this respect ,",
    "the larger population helps to ensure , according to the condorcet jury theorem , that the decisions are either definitely right or definitely wrong .",
    "other technologies can be utilized to induce participation by only those that are more likely than not to choose the optimal decision .",
