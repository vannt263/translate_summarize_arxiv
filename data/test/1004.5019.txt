    "insulating states of non - trivial topological order have attracted much attention both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "a topological insulator has a remarkable property of being metallic on the surface albeit insulating in the bulk .",
    "recently much focus is on a specific type of topological insulators,@xcite which are said to be `` @xmath0-nontrivial '' .",
    "@xcite the latter occurs as a consequence of interplay between a specific type of spin - orbit interaction and band structure .",
    "@xcite such systems are invariant under time reversal and show kramers degeneracy . from the viewpoint of an experimental realization , the original idea of kane and mele ( km ) @xcite",
    "was often criticized for being unrealistic , since it relies on a relatively weak spin - orbit coupling in graphene . in order to overcome such difficulty , bernevig , hugues and zhang ( bhz ) proposed an alternative system @xcite , which is also @xmath0-nontrivial but not based on graphene .",
    "bhz model was intended to describe low - energy electronic properties of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) layer of hgte / cdte quantum well .",
    "conductance measurement in a ribbon geometry @xcite showed that the system exhibits indeed a metallic surface state , which is also called _",
    "helical _ edge modes .",
    "this paper highlights the spectrum and wave function of such helical edge modes in the bhz model .",
    "respecting appropriately the crystal structure of original hgte / cdte quantum well , one can safely implement it as a tight - binding model on a 2d square lattice.@xcite note , however , that in contrast to km model which can be represented as a purely lattice model , in bhz an internal spin-@xmath14 degree of freedom , stemming from the @xmath15-type @xmath16 and @xmath17-type @xmath18 orbitals , resides on each site of the square lattice in addition to the real electronic spin .",
    "we also mention that in the continuum limit with vanishing topological mass term , km model has two valleys ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , whereas bhz has a single valley ( at @xmath21 ) .",
    "another idea which we can borrow from graphene study is the sensibility of edge spectrum on different types of edge structure , i.e. , either zigzag of armchair type .",
    "@xcite this applies also to the helical edge modes of bhz topological insulator in a ribbon geometry , since the edge spectrum is predominantly determined by how the 2d bulk band structure is `` projected '' onto the 1d edge axis .",
    "indeed , the structure of bhz helical edge modes has been extensively studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath7-edge geometry and in the tight - binding implementation .",
    "however , in the practical experimental setup , @xcite this is certainly not the only one which is relevant to determine the transport characteristics at the edges . here , in this paper our main focus is on the other representative geometry , the @xmath11-edge . in the @xmath11-geometry , as a consequence of the specific way how `` hidden '' dirac cones ( or valleys ) in the 2d spectrum is projected onto the @xmath11-axis , edge modes show some unexpected behaviors . in order to motivate further the present study ,",
    "let us first recall the importance of edge modes in the quantum hall state under magnetic field that exhibits a finite and quantized ( charge ) hall conductivity @xmath22 . in realistic samples with a boundary , quantization of hall conductivity is attributed to dissipationless transport due to a gapless chiral edge mode .",
    "in contrast to charge hall effect , a finite _ spin _ hall current does not need breaking of the time reversal symmetry . in the quantized spin hall ( qsh )",
    "effect , the chern number in the bulk takes an integral value , and correspondingly there appears integral pairs of gapless edge modes . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 topological insulator is characterized by an odd number of gapless modes per edge that are robust against weak perturbations preserving the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the existence of such gapless edge states is generally guaranteed by a general theorem under the name of bulk / edge correspondence .",
    "@xcite the bhz model has a convenient feature that the location of the minimum energy gap can be controlled by changing the parameters in the model .",
    "in particular , the sign of spin hall conductivity changes discontinuously as the mass parameter of the model is varied .",
    "hence , the corresponding change of edge spectrum should provide useful information on the bulk / edge correspondence .",
    "furthermore , understanding of the nature of edge modes under specific edge geometries should serve as possible application of topologically protected phenomena in nano - architectonics .",
    "we take the representative cases of the @xmath7- and @xmath11-edges , which we call also the straight and zigzag edges , respectively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we clarify our motivations to study the lattice version of a @xmath0 topological insulator ( bhz model ) , implemented as a nearest - neighbor ( nn ) tight - binding model",
    ". explicit form of the bhz lattice hamiltonian is introduced in sec .",
    "it is demonstrated that by considering a lattice model , one naturally takes into account _ hidden _ dirac cones , the latter lacking in the analyses based on the continuum dirac model . in secs .",
    "iv and v , we study the detailed structure of gapless edge modes under two different edge geometries : straight and zigzag edges .",
    "v is the highlight of this paper , demonstrating that the zigzag edge modes of bhz lattice model show unique features .",
    "we first point out that at @xmath23 , a pair of completely flat spectrum appears at @xmath24 ; besides the edge wave function can be trivially solved .",
    "we then show , in a half - empirical way , that this analytic exact solution at @xmath23 can be generalized to the case of an arbitrary @xmath25 $ ] ( this idea is schematically represented in fig . [ zig_concept ] ) . using the exact solution",
    "thus constructed , we highlight the nature of _ reentrant _ edge modes , another unique feature of the edge modes in the @xmath11-edge geometry .",
    "the reentrant edge modes possess two contrasting characters in real and momentum spaces : though well distinguished in real space , they live in an extremely small energy scale in the spectrum .",
    "vi is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the gapless edge modes of bhz topological insulator are also treated in the framework of continuum dirac model in appendix a.",
    "it has been well recognized that the quantized spin hall conductivity is determined by wave functions of bloch electrons over the entire brillouin zone . on the other hand ,",
    "only the electronic states near the fermi level are relevant to the change of the hall conductivity when the fermi level is shifted .",
    "simplified effective models are useful for the latter case since various theoretical techniques can be employed in the low - energy range . in this paper",
    ", we work mainly with the lattice version of the bhz model , and make some comments in the low - momentum limit .      why do we have to go back to a lattice model ?",
    "firstly , because we need to recover the _",
    "correct _ absolute value of spin hall conductance @xmath26 .",
    "the latter is defined as the difference of hall conductance for up and down ( pseudo ) spins multiplied by @xmath27 : @xmath28 in quantized spin hall ( qsh ) systems , the spin hall conductance is quantized to be an integer in units of @xmath29 . in the language of charge conductance . ]",
    "this is completely in parallel with the quantization of _ charge _ hall conductance in units of @xmath30 in quantized hall system . in both cases ,",
    "such integers are topological invariants and protected against weak perturbations .    on the other hand",
    ", if one calculates , using kubo formula , the contribution of a single dirac fermion , e.g. , of the continuous dirac model at the @xmath21-point @xcite to spin hall conductance , then this gives _",
    "half _ of the value expected from the topological quantization .",
    "@xcite in order to be consistent , it is naturally assumed that there must be _ even _ number of dirac cones .",
    "@xcite however , the low - energy effective theory with which we are starting contains obviously a single dirac cone .",
    "@xcite as we will see explicitly , such trivial discrepancy is naturally resolved by considering a lattice version of the bhz model .",
    "another aspect motivating us to employ the lattice version of bhz model is the fact the idea of an edge states is a real space concept , and we need _ a priori _ to go back to real space to give an unambiguous definition to it . in this paper",
    ", we highlight the detailed structure of gapless edge modes under a specific edge geometry .",
    "clearly , introduction of the latter needs a precise description in real space .",
    "recall also here that edge modes of graphene nano - ribbon exhibit contrasting behaviors in zigzag and armchair edge geometries : e.g. , the system becomes either metallic or semi - conducting in the armchair geometry , depending on @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the number of rows , whereas a completely flat edge mode appears in the zigzag geometry .",
    "@xcite where does the difference comes from ? in momentum space , the question is how the bulk dirac cone structure look like when viewed from the edge .",
    "note that in the zigzag geometry the flat edge mode connects the two dirac points : @xmath19 and @xmath20 , whereas in the armchair geometry these two points are projected onto the same point at the edge . in a topological insulator ,",
    "this bulk to edge projection is even a more subtle issue , since not all the dirac cones are explicit ( see table i ) . in a sense , zigzag edge in the square lattice bhz model ( see fig .",
    "[ geo_zig ] ) plays the following double role : it resembles the zigzag edge in graphene at @xmath33 , whereas it may rather resemble the armchair edge at @xmath34 and at @xmath35 .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ 4dpts ]      spin hall conductance is a topological quantity determined by the _ global _ structure of entire 2d brillouin zone . the helical edge modes , encoding the same information , is , therefore , _ a priori _ not derived from a local description in the 2d brillouin zone .",
    "one exception to such a general idea is the study of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also appendix ) , in which gapless edge modes are derived from the continuous model in a strip geometry by simply applying the condition that all the pseudo spin components of wave function vanish at the boundary .",
    "( @xmath3)-sublattice component of the wave function vanishes at one ( the other ) boundary . for details ,",
    "see , ref . @xcite .",
    "] this implies that information about the helical edge modes is actually encoded in the original ( single ) dirac cone .",
    "this seems to be rather surprising , if one recalls that in the case of km model , the distinction between trivial and non - trivial phases is made by a relative sign of the mass gap at @xmath19- and @xmath20- points , which are , of course , macroscopically separated in momentum space . here",
    ", in the bhz model , the same distinction is made by relative sign between the mass ( @xmath36- ) term and the @xmath37- term added to the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "motivated by this observation , we investigate the structure of helical edge modes under different boundary conditions for the periodic bhz model , implemented as a square lattice and nearest - neighbor ( nn ) tight - binding model model .",
    "in parallel with the arm chair and zigzag edges for graphene , we consider ( a ) usually considered @xmath7- ( straight ) boundary @xcite , as well as ( b ) @xmath11- ( zigzag ) boundary for the tight - binding bhz model .",
    "the idea of focusing on dirac fermions in the description of quantized hall effect has appeared in the context of transitions between different plateaus . for describing the transitions ,",
    "half - integer quantization is not a drawback , since the difference of hall conductance before and after the gap closing is quantized to be an integer in units of @xmath30 : @xmath38 or vice versa .",
    "a discrete jump in the hall conductance across the transition is indeed consistent with counting based on the emergence of massless dirac fermions at the transition @xcite .",
    "the absolute value of hall conductance is , on the other hand , a winding number , and determined by the vortices @xcite . here",
    ", each vortex gives , in contrast to a dirac cone , an integral contribution to the hall conductance ( in units of @xmath30 ) .",
    "an interesting question is whether the total hall conductance , often expressed as a topological invariant @xcite , can be also written as a sum of contributions from emergent dirac electrons in the spectrum .",
    "our empirical answer is yes,@xcite indicating that the number of dirac electrons emergent in the spectrum is always even , reminiscent of the no - go theorem of nielsen and ninomiya in 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that here not only explicit dirac electrons ( gapless for a given set of parameters ) but also hidden dirac electrons ( massive for that set of parameters ) must be taken into account .",
    "such massive dirac electrons are called `` spectators '' in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the sense that they are inactive for the transition .",
