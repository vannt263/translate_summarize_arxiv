    "chaos in ordinary language means disorder , randomness , absence of law , and unpredictability .",
    "it played the major role in philosophy of ancient greeks .",
    "already empedocles ( cca.490430 b.c . )",
    "viewed the real world , , as a combination of the world of perfect order , ( today we may tentatively translate it as ) , and the world of complete disorder , . since chaos seemed to be too elusive for any kind of rigorous description , the attention of science has for long been focused only to sphairos .",
    "this has changed over the past decades when numerous explorations have shown that chaos is not as lawless as originally thought . at present , the term _ chaos theory _ belongs to the common speak @xcite .    in both classical and quantum physics @xcite",
    "is built on very sophisticated mathematics .",
    "it sticks on the original idea of randomness , but at the same time it creates a new type of universality in the representation of reality .",
    "the universality of chaos is based on ergodic character of motions and implies high efficiency of the statistically oriented description . since majority of systems in nature",
    "are chaotic , at least to a considerable extent , this type of description is often the ultimate one .",
    "the routes to more deterministic descriptions may exist but they are usually impassable .",
    "chaos thus belongs to very fundamental subjects in physics .    among the physical systems that materialize the signatures of chaos in nature , an important place is held by atomic nuclei .",
    "already the fact that even more than 80 years after the discovery of their composition we are not able to present a satisfactory microscopic theory of nuclear structure is a good reason to think that nuclei are indeed chaotic objects par excellence .",
    "it is not an accident that nuclei were at dawn of the field named quantum chaos .",
    "however , atomic nuclei not only show well recognized signs of chaos , they also provide a variety of models that can be used to better understand the rules of chaos in a more general context . such a path is followed in this text .",
    "our aim is not to draw an exhaustive map of the overlap between physics of chaos and physics of nuclei ",
    "such reviews exist @xcite and we may only recommend to read them .",
    "instead , we want to make a passage through selected topics of classical and quantum chaos using models taken from the description of nuclear collective dynamics .",
    "before diving into the ocean of chaos , we have to briefly introduce the models we will be playing with .",
    "these are the old ( and the good ) geometric collective model ( below abbreviated as gcm ) and the newer and more sophisticated interacting boson model ( ibm ) of nuclei .",
    "both these models attempt to describe nuclear collective motions  vibrations and rotations  assuming only the quadrupole type of nuclear deformations .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom associated with both gcm and ibm is five .",
    "two degrees of freedom correspond to the quadrupole deformation of the nucleus in the body - fixed frame ( one can think of an ellipsoid with a fixed volume ) ; their dynamics therefore represents vibrational motions .",
    "the other three degrees of freedom correspond to the orientation of the whole nucleus in the laboratory frame  they describe rotations . in the following we will mostly consider only the non - rotational case , i.e. , fix the angular momentum ( which is an integral of motions ) to zero . in this case , we will be left just with two vibrational degrees of freedom , opening a direct link to other @xmath0 systems famously studied in the context of chaos .",
    "we will see that nuclear vibrations represent a rather rich specimen of chaos in two dimensions .",
    "the gcm , introduced already in 1952 by a.bohr ( for the review see @xcite ) , treats the nucleus as structureless drop described by quadrupole shape variables @xmath1 and rotation euler angles @xmath2 .",
    "these 5 generalized coordinates are associated with a particular parametrization of the rank-2 tensor @xmath3 ( real , symmetric , and traceless in the cartesian form ) , describing the quadrupole deformation of the nucleus in the laboratory frame .",
    "the deformation tensor @xmath3 can be introduced via the expansion of the nuclear radius @xmath4 to spherical harmonics @xmath5 , or alternatively via multipole moments of the nuclear mass ( charge ) distribution @xmath6 . in the first case",
    ", the @xmath7 spherical component of the deformation tensor ( @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10 ) is associated with the coefficient ( up to complex conjugation ) at the @xmath11 term of the radius expansion . in the second case ,",
    "the deformation tensor is obtained via the following integral ( up to a scaling factor ) of the mass ( charge ) density : @xmath12 .",
    "any variables describing the shape of the nucleus must be invariant under rotations of the nucleus as a whole .",
    "there are just two independent building blocks for all rotational invariants made of the quadrupole deformation tensor  namely the quadratic and cubic couplings of the quadrupole tensor to zero total angular momentum .",
    "the shape variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be defined as a certain parameterization of these two elementary couplings:^{(\\lambda)}$ ] of rank-@xmath15 and -@xmath16 spherical tensors @xmath17 and @xmath18 to the resulting spherical tensor of rank @xmath19 ( the definition is analogous to the elementary angular momentum coupling ) .",

    "@xmath22^{(0)}=\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\ \\beta^2 \\ , \\qquad [ [ \\alpha^{(2)}\\times\\alpha^{(2)}]^{(2)}\\times\\alpha^{(2)}]^{(0)}=-\\sqrt{7}\\ \\beta^3\\cos 3\\gamma \\label{bega } \\,.\\ ] ] alternatively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be derived from the eigenvalues of @xmath3 , which read as @xmath23 $ ] , @xmath24 , @xmath25\\bigr)$ ] .",
    "these values are the only components of the deformation tensor in the intrinsic frame ( if ) of the nucleus ( the frame connected with the principal axes of the quadrupole deformation ) , where the deformation tensor is diagonal .",

    "note that @xmath1 can be considered as radial coordinates in the cartesian plane @xmath26 . while the radius @xmath13 quantifies the degree of deformation of the nucleus ( @xmath27 for spherical shape ) , the angle @xmath14 parameterizes the type of the deformed shape .",
    "the plane is divided into six equivalent angular sectors , which follow from an inherent discrete symmetry of the problem , given by the dynamical equivalence of three possible orientations of the deformed shape in the if ( along @xmath28 ) and two deformation types ( prolate , oblate ) .",
    "the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 axially symmetric prolate or oblates shapes are located at @xmath14 equal to @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively , while the intermediate @xmath14 values correspond to the related triaxial shapes .",
    "note that these conclusions are consistent with the above - given form of the deformation tensor in the intrinsic frame . to become more familiar with the formalism ( which , as one has to agree , looks rather tough as the first sight )",
    ", the reader is encouraged to consult specialized literature , e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "the plane of deformation coordinates with the basic sample of shapes is depicted in fig.[begafi ] .",
    "the momenta associated with the coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 are denoted as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . in the non - rotational case , as noted above , the euler angles @xmath2 are fixed , rendering zero values of the associated rotational momenta .",
    "the resulting vibrational hamiltonian therefore contains just the shape variables @xmath1 and the corresponding momenta @xmath37 .",
    "our analysis is performed mostly with the hamiltonian which contains purely quadratic momentum term of the kinetic energy , and quadratic , cubic and quartic coordinate terms of the potential energy : @xmath38}_{t_{\\rm vib}}+\\underbrace{a\\beta^2+b\\beta^3\\cos 3\\gamma+c\\beta^4}_{v_{\\rm vib}}\\ , .",
    "\\label{hgcm}\\ ] ] @xmath39 and @xmath40 are adjustable parameters satisfying physical constraints @xmath41 ( kinetic energy is positive ) and @xmath42 ( the potential is confining ) .",
    "the geometric hamiltonian ( [ hgcm ] ) is closely related to the famous hnon - heiles hamiltonian , which was originally introduced in the context of stellar dynamics in galaxies and became a paradigmatic example of chaos in the classical domain @xcite .",
    "the hnon - heiles hamiltonian is a special case of eq.([hgcm ] ) with @xmath43 . in this contribution ( as in ref.@xcite )",
    "we claim that the inclusion of the confining @xmath44 term generates even much richer structures than those obtained in the @xmath43 case .",
    "the coexistence of regular and chaotic types of classical motions generated by the full geometric hamiltonian at high energies is illustrated in fig.[begafi ] .",
    "the two trajectories shown in this figure were calculated for the same model parameters and energy , but represent very dissimilar species of collective motions .",
    "the regular orbit corresponds to a moderate , highly organized vibration , localized in a relatively small region around an axially symmetric equilibrium shape ( above the potential well to which the nucleus with given parameters drops in the low energy limit ) .",
    "in contrast , the chaotic orbit represents some large - amplitude vibrations , which rather disorderly wander through small , medium and large oblate deformations with all three intrinsic orientations",
    ".    a generalization of the simple hamiltonian ( [ hgcm ] ) can be achieved by considering higher - order terms in kinetic or potential energy .",
    "we consider two extensions of the kinetic energy , particularly @xcite : @xmath45 \\,,\\qquad t_{\\rm vib}^{(ii)}=\\frac{1}{2m(1+\\kappa\\beta^2)}\\left[p_\\beta^2+\\left(\\frac{p_\\gamma}{\\beta}\\right)^2\\right ] \\",
    ", , \\label{halt}\\ ] ] both based on some specific deformation - dependent effective mass ( @xmath46 is an additional model parameter ) .",
    "such or similar extensions of the effective mass are relevant for the description of nuclear rotational bands since they modify the behavior of nuclear moments of inertia . here we consider them to probe the sensitivity of the vibrational measures of chaos to the general form of the hamiltonian kinetic term .",
    "another extension of the above hamiltonian is the inclusion of rotational terms , containing the intrinsic components of angular momentum and the corresponding moments of inertia .",
    "this however leads beyond the 2d description and makes the analysis much more difficult .",
    "we follow this line only in rather a restricted manner  considering only rotations around a fixed axis @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this can be done by introducing a third collective coordinate , angle @xmath47 , and the associate momentum @xmath48 , which coincides with the angular momentum of the nucleus around @xmath31 in both laboratory and intrinsic frames .",
    "the quadrupole deformation tensor @xmath49 in the laboratory frame is obtained from the diagonal form @xmath50 in the intrinsic frame ( see above ) via rotation by angle @xmath51 around the @xmath31-axis .",
    "this identifies @xmath47 as a variable connected with the if @xmath52 lf transition .",
    "the rotational energy reads as : @xmath53 which has to be added to the vibrational hamiltonian in eq.([hgcm ] ) to get the total hamiltonian @xmath54 .",
    "details can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "an important feature of the geometric hamiltonian is related to its scaling properties  the fact that dynamics of the system must be invariant under scale transformations affecting the units of relevant quantities , i.e. , energy , coordinate , and momentum .",
    "let us return now to the bare vibrational hamiltonian ( [ hgcm ] ) .",
    "since the scale transformations of this form can be absorbed in parameters @xmath55 , we deduce that some choices of these parameters must be dynamically equivalent .",
    "a more detailed treatment @xcite shows that the quantity @xmath56 is invariant under all scale transformation and represents the only essential parameter of the bare vibrational model in the classical case .",
    "the value of the mass parameter @xmath40 is relevant only in the quantum case , weighting the absolute density of quantum states in the discrete energy spectrum ( for @xmath57 we get the classical limit with infinite state density ) .",
    "this effective parameter reduction implies a crucial simplification of the numerical analysis of the geometric model .",
    "the quantization of the nuclear geometric model is achieved by replacing individual terms in the gcm hamiltonian by the corresponding operators in the hilbert space of wavefunctions @xmath58 .",
    "this task is mathematically rather involved and was completed with a substantial contribution of the patron of this school , marcos moshinsky  see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and many others .",
    "the basic form of the vibrational kinetic energy reads as follows : @xmath59 note that this operator acts in the space where the scalar product @xmath60 is given by an integration over the collective coordinates with a specific measure @xcite .",
    "the expression of the potential @xmath61 is the same as in the classical case , see eq.([hgcm ] ) .",
    "since we are mostly interested in the non - rotational motions , the rotational energy will not be included into the quantized hamiltonian .",
    "examining eq.([tqgcm ] ) one immediately notices the differences from the kinetic energy of a particle in a 2d space , which in polar coordinates @xmath62 reads as @xmath63 .",
    "the absence of euler angles in the description of vibrational motions suggests a possibility to quantize the vibrational energy in the standard 2d manner , i.e. , using the formula : @xmath64 note that this implies a change of the definition of scalar product and the necessity to impose the condition @xmath65 to keep link with the 5d quantization , where this condition is naturally satisfied .",
    "in addition , we choose one of two possible angle - reflection symmetries of the wavefunctions , namely @xmath66 .",
    "we therefore construct three different quantizations of the vibrational collective hamiltonian , all of them yielding the same classical limit : the 2d - even , 2d - odd , and the 5d quantizations ( in the 5d case , the reflection symmetry is fixed ) . from the viewpoint of nuclear theory , only the 5d option is correct , but from the viewpoint of chaos theory ( which is in our focus here ) we have the freedom to probe all three possibilities .",
    "we will use this freedom to check the influence of the quantization scheme on the signatures of quantum chaos . for details , see ref.@xcite .    let us move to the alternative description of nuclear collective motions with the aid of the interacting boson model .",
    "the ibm , introduced in 1970 s by f.iachello and a.arima ( for a review see @xcite ) , does a similar job as the gcm , but in terms of an ensemble of bosons with angular momentum 0 ( @xmath67-bosons ) and 2 ( @xmath68-bosons ) .",
    "these bosons are commonly interpreted as an approximation for nucleon pairs in an even - even nucleus ( their total number @xmath69 is usually fixed at a half of the number of valence nucleons ) , but at the same time they give rise to quadrupole degrees of freedom needed to describe basic collective motions of nuclei .",
    "the @xmath67- and @xmath68-bosons live in a hilbert space associated solely with their spin degree of freedom ( such space has a finite dimension ) and interact with each other through two - body interactions .",
    "for instance , a popular form of the hamiltonian is composed of the @xmath68-boson number operator @xmath70 and a bosonic quadrupole operator @xmath71 as follows : @xmath72)^{(2)}}_{\\hat{q}_\\chi}\\cdot\\underbrace{(d^\\dag s+s^\\dag\\tilde{d}+\\chi[d^\\dag\\times\\tilde{d}])^{(2)}}_{\\hat{q}_\\chi } \\ , , \\label{hibm}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath68-boson annihilation operators @xmath73 having proper transformation properties of a rank-2 tensor .",
    "the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 , weighting both terms in eq.([hibm ] ) , are more or less arbitrary , while @xmath76 from the quadrupole operator varies within interval @xmath77 for prolate shapes and @xmath78 $ ] for oblate shapes .",
    "note that the @xmath70 term of the above hamiltonian is of the 1-body nature and the term @xmath79 generates specific 2-body interactions .",
    "the link between the bosonic hamiltonian  la ( [ hibm ] ) and the geometric hamiltonian of the type ( [ hgcm ] ) goes via the use of coherent states in the ibm .",
    "for instance , the glauber type of coherent states with an average total number of boson equal to @xmath69 is given by : ) onto a subspace with a sharp boson number , yielding a bosonic condensate state . ]",
    "@xmath80\\ket{0 } \\label{glau } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath81 stands for a normalization factor to ensure @xmath82 .",
    "the complex variables @xmath83 ( with @xmath84 ) which parameterize the coherent state , have transformation properties of a rank-2 spherical tensor and can be associated with a linear combination of the deformation tensor @xmath3 and the tensor of associated momenta @xmath85 . performing the same gymnastics as in the gcm case ( for details",
    "see ref.@xcite ) , one obtains the five generalizad collective coordinates @xmath86 and the corresponding momenta .",
    "the general bosonic hamiltonian @xmath87 is then translated into a function of these canonical variables by evaluating its expectation value in the respective coherent state @xmath88 . in the @xmath89 limit , this function coincides with the classical hamiltonian @xmath90 associated with @xmath87 .     and @xmath91 , using two truncation dimensions of the hamltonian matrix expressed in the 2d oscillator basis , namely @xmath9239905 and 59080 . panel ( a ) shows a quantum measure of chaos @xmath93 ( where @xmath94 is so - called brody parameter of the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution ; for explanation see below ) calculated for spectra determined by a numerical diagonalization in both truncated bases .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) show the absolute and relative differences between individual level energies , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "it is seen that at a certain energy the two calculations yield diverging results .",
    "only the fraction of the spectrum below the vertical dashed line ( corresponding to less than a half of the smaller dimension ) is reproduced correctly . adapted from ref.@xcite . ]    for instance , hamiltonian ( [ hibm ] ) yields the following classical limit @xcite : @xmath97\\sqrt{1-\\frac{t+\\beta^2}{2 } } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "thus the square root in eq.([hibmclas ] ) is always well defined .",
    "we may conclude that the ibm classical hamiltonians are closely related to the gcm hamiltonians , discussed above , though by far not identical with them .",
    "the most important difference between both models lies in the kinetic energy terms , which have a much more complex form in the ibm case . on the other hand ,",
    "the potential energy terms , which can be extracted from the hamiltonian by setting all momenta to zero , are rather similar and yield analogous dynamical features .    in conclusion of this section",
    "we say a few words on numerical computations .",
    "classical trajectories for both gcm and ibm are determined with the aid of the fourth - order runge - kutta integration of the classical equations of motions .",
    "some details can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "quantum spectra are obtained through a numerical diagonalization of the respective quantum hamiltonian .",
    "calculations within the ibm ( which has just a finite dimensional hilbert space ) are naturally done in the complete basis composed of states with different numbers @xmath67- and @xmath68-bosons , coupled to definite angular momenta .",
    "the calculations in gcm ( infinite dimensional space ) has to be performed in a truncated basis .",
    "the results of these must be checked for convergence .",
    "let us streess that due to the restriction to the subset of the quantum spectrum with angular momentum @xmath101 , we perform all gcm calculations in two dimensions .",
    "in general , only a certain fraction of the gcm states obtained by the numerical diagonalization within a truncated 2d basis can be employed in the analyses . as illustrated in fig.[egcm ] , these converged states yield unambiguous and reliable results .",
    "in physics , we like most to deal with integrable systems .",
    "these are the systems which  roughly speaking  have a sufficiently large degree of symmetry to make the dynamical equations solvable .",
    "more precisely @xcite , the full integrability of a classical hamiltonian system with @xmath102 degrees of freedom requires the following three conditions to be simultaneously satisfied : ( a ) there exists @xmath102 integrals of motions @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) , represented as functions in the @xmath105-dimensional phase space which have zero poisson bracket with the hamiltonian , @xmath106 , ( b ) all these integrals are mutually , i.e. , have vanishing poisson brackets with each other , @xmath107 @xmath108 ( in quantum mechanics , we would say : they are compatible ) , and ( c ) the @xmath105-dimensional gradients @xmath109 are all linearly independent in every point of the phase space .",
    "these conditions guarantee that the hamiltonian ( as well as any other conserved quantity ) can be written as a function of the given integrals , @xmath110 , and that there exists a canonical transformation @xmath111 to some new variables ( so - called action - angle variables ) in terms of which the solution of the hamilton equations becomes rather trivial ( the transformation itself being usually highly nontrivial ) .    for example , the dynamics of the geometric collective model and the interacting boson model is integrable if the corresponding hamiltonian does not depend on variable @xmath14 .",
    "then the momentum @xmath36 becomes an integral of motion , in addition to the hamiltonian @xmath112 itself .",
    "it is easy to verify that all three conditions for integrability in dimension @xmath0 are fulfilled in this situation : ( a ) and ( b ) are obvious , and ( c ) follows from the fact that the gradient of @xmath112 is a nonvanishing normal to the energy surface , while the gradient of @xmath36 is a nonvanishing tangent  therefore , they always define two perpendicular directions .    as we see from eqs.([hgcm ] ) and ( [ hibmclas ] ) , the gcm and ibm hamiltonians are independent of @xmath14 ( hence integrable ) for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively . the @xmath36-dependent integral of motion",
    "is usually written in a less trivial form @xcite : @xmath115 ( where @xmath116 are components of the angular momentum @xmath117 in the if ) , which defines a quantity in the nuclear context called .",
    "note that the rigorous proof of integrability in the full dimension @xmath118 ( including rotational degrees of freedom ) requires a construction of the fifth integral of motions , which is additional to @xmath112 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "the ibm hamiltonian ( [ hibm ] ) has an extra realization of integrability , situated at the points @xmath122 of the parameter space ( @xmath75 remains an arbitrary scaling parameter ) .",
    "it can be shown that this case of integrability of the ibm hamiltonian is connected with its underlying su(3 ) dynamical symmetry @xcite .",
    "( red and blue dots ) and @xmath123 ( black dot ) . the two cases , differing just by a small displacement of the lighter body , show rather different sets of trajectories",

    "panel ( a ) shows evolution of initially close trajectories for times @xmath124 units , in which the deviation is not large .",
    "panel ( b ) displays the evolution for times @xmath125 units , the two final positions represented by the blue and red dots ( with the corresponding shapes drawn aside ) .",
    "note that long - time deviation between the two vibrational orbits ( given in the inset ) reaches a saturation regime , which follows from the boundedness of the system for any finite energy . ]    already from these examples it must be obvious that integrability is a rather rare spice , therefore that by far not all the systems are integrable .",
    "the full realization of this simple fact and its essential consequences came surprisingly late  only in the last decade of the 19th century .",
    "it happened independently and almost simultaneously in the works of h.poincar ' e and a.lyapunov , who can undoubtedly be named the founders of chaos .",
    "poincar ' e s story , in particular , can be used as an exemplary illustration of the random ways in which science makes its progress @xcite .",
    "poincar ' e , who in the preceding years spent a lot of effort to solve the three body problem , submitted an account of his results to a scientific competition , organized in 1885 to celebrate the birthday anniversary of king oscar ii of sweden .",
    "his work won the competition , but an assistant of one of the famous mathematicians in the jury noticed some unclear points in the derivations .",
    "the thing was even much more complex than poincar ' e thought . in 1890",
    ", he submitted a new version of his treatise , in which the mathematical notion of chaos  defined in the sense of instability of motions ",
    "was born . in one of the later writings poincar",
    "' e explains : _ _ an example of this behavior is given in fig.[body3 ] .",
    "the new treatise was published at poincar ' e own expenses , exceeding the reward of the competition , which may serve as a warning to those who think that science must always be profitable .",
    "lyapunov came to similar conclusions ( concerning the instability of motions ) in 1892 in his doctoral thesis @xcite .",
    "the description of chaos remained for long a rather exotic domain of abstract mathematics .",
    "in integrable systems , the transformation to action - angle variables @xmath126 ensures that motions in the phase - space , described by hamilton equations @xmath127 and @xmath128 , are localized on manifolds , which are topologically equivalent to tori .",
    "these motions are therefore highly organized .",
    "poincar ' e himself developed a method how the tori can be visualized for systems with @xmath0 .",
    "the method is based on cutting the phase space by a planar section and marking passages of individual trajectories through the section  today we call these pictures poincar maps .",
    "systems results from the requirement that each point of the planar section is crossed by a single trajectory .",
    "indeed , the point in the section is characterized by 2 variables ( usually a coordinate @xmath129 and the associated momentum @xmath130 ) , another variable is fixed by the section constraint ( often of the form @xmath131 ) , and the fourth variable ( e.g. , the momentum @xmath132 ) can  for hamiltonian systems  be computed from energy conservation .",
    "therefore , we have determined all 4 variables in the 4-dimensional phase space . for @xmath133 systems with no integrals of motions additional to @xmath112",
    "the poincar ' e map would have to be more than 2-dimensional , which is rather impractical . ] but what happens when the integrability is destroyed ? certainly , some of the tori must die , but what is the exact scenario and an underlying mechanism ?",
    "plane in the phase space ; details of the hamiltonian can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the concentric curves correspond to deformed phase - space tori .",
    "all panels show examples of the poincar ' e - birkhoff fixed - point theorem .",
    "courtesy of m.macek . ]    in 1912 , poincar ' e conjectured a theorem , in which he partly attacked this problem . the theorem was proven in 1913 and finalized in 1925 by g. birkhoff and became known as the poincar ' e - birkhoff fixed - point theorem .",
    "consider an @xmath0 torus characterized by a pair of frequencies @xmath134 with ratio @xmath135 .",
    "if @xmath136 is an irrational number , the trajectory never closes a loop ",
    "the motion is only quasi - periodic .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath136 is rational , all trajectories on the given torus are periodic  after @xmath137 crossings of the poincar ' e surface they return to the initial point .",
    "the theorem of poncar ' e and birkhoff is focused on such a rational tori , or more precisely , on the remnants of these tori after the destruction of integrability by a general perturbation .",
    "they showed that each periodic torus leaves an even number of fixed points in the poincar ' e map  a half of these fixed points is stable ( elliptic ) , the other half is unstable ( hyperbolic ) .",
    "this was the first indication that the transition from the full regularity of an integrable system to a complete chaos of a strongly perturbed system is a highly non - trivial ( and usually rather fascinating ! ) process .",
    "figure  [ ibmsec ] shows some examples of poncar ' e maps generated by the ibm hamiltonian with @xmath101 ( hence @xmath0 ) .",
    "alternating islands of elliptic and hyperbolic fixed points are clearly visible .    several decades later , an essential and famous result related to the order - to - chaos transition in classical hamiltonian systems was formulated and proven by a.kolmogorov ( 1954 ) , v.arnold ( 1963 ) , and j.moser ( 1962 ) .",
    "it is nowadays known as the kam theorem @xcite .",
    "what does it tell us ?",
    "it attacks the problem of what exactly happens if an integrable system is subject to an increasingly strong non - integrable perturbation . which of the tori of the original system die , for a given strength of perturbation , and which survive in a deformed form ?",
    "it turned out that the rational tori , such as those considered above , disappear immediately , leaving only the above described remnants . on the other hand ,",
    "some of the irrational tori are rather they may survive ( in a deformed form ) even rather strong perturbations .",
    "the clue for the torus to survive is that it must be .",

    "at first , we fix @xmath176 and change @xmath287 , visualizing the onset of chaotic vibrations in deformed nuclei and their partial regularization at larger values of @xmath75 .",
    "next we keep @xmath179 and change @xmath288 . in this way , we make a transition between two qualitatively different types of the potential  the one corresponding to deformed equilibrium shapes of the nucleus and the one associated with spherical nuclei ( the @xmath289 potentials have three degenerate minima at @xmath290 , while those with @xmath74 above a certain critical value @xmath291 have just a single global minimum at @xmath292 ) . and @xmath290 minima of the potential become degenerate and swap is at @xmath293 . ] finally , we fix @xmath294 and decrease @xmath295 , coming back to the integrable regime , but on the spherical side of the parameter plane .",
    "the most chaotic lattices are the ones in panels ( c ) and ( e ) .",
    "the first corresponds to @xmath296 , which coincides with the first minimum of @xmath150 at @xmath139 in fig.[freg0 ] .",
    "both peres lattices in this panel can be compared with the energy dependences of @xmath182 and with the other measures of chaos shown in panels ( a ) and ( c ) of fig.[qchagcm ] .",
    "we may notice that the regions with increased regularity in fig.[qchagcm ] correspond to the occurrence of regular parts of the lattice in fig.[pergcm](c ) .",
    "the chaotic lattice in panel ( e ) corresponds to @xmath297 , which is a point situated near the between spherical and deformed shapes .",
    "many other examples of peres lattices and their detailed comparison with the dependence @xmath182 can be found in refs.@xcite and @xcite .    from the examples shown here and in the literature it can be inferred that peres lattices significantly complement the standard methods used to investigate chaotic properties of quantum systems .",
    "in fact , they even enable one to go beyond the standard methods .",
    "this is so because quantum states can be _ individually assigned _ to distinctly regular or distinctly chaotic parts of the lattice , which is in contrast to the statistical approach that can only attribute some averaged regular / chaotic attributes to sufficiently large ensembles of states .",
    "constructing a suitable peres lattice for a given quantum system with known spectral correlations is therefore similar to analyzing the classical dynamics with a given @xmath150 by means of poincar ' e sections .",
    "two remarks on the applicability of the method are in order : first , to unambiguously deduce whether a given state is in a regular or chaotic domain of the spectrum , it is usually useful to construct peres lattices for several operators .",
    "a comparison of several lattices helps particularly in situations when an overlap of two or more regular parts in a single lattice produces a seemingly chaotic mesh .",
    "second , the method in the above - presented form is applicable only in systems with @xmath0 .",
    "consider , for example , an integrable system with @xmath298 . to ensure a one - to - one mapping from the space of canonical actions @xmath299",
    ", one would have to consider a @xmath300-dimensional lattice ( @xmath102-dimensional in general ) .",
    "this is , however , rather difficult with only 2d physical literature being available . these unalterable limitations of us , poor 3d creatures , will probably always hinder our understanding of higher than 2d systems .",
    "we are arriving to the end of our short tour .",
    "its purpose was to show some known concepts of chaos theory by means of simple models taken from the nuclear context .",
    "was the marriage of chaos with nuclei successful ?",
    "we believe it was .",
    "we think that the models like those used here provide an excellent environment for general investigations of chaos in both classical and quantum incarnations  environment , which is sufficiently complex to embrace diverse nontrivial phenomena , but at the same time simple enough to allow an intelligible description . in analogy with the billiard models , that have been extensively used for such investigations in the past decades , the nuclear models can be used as models with two degrees of freedom .",
    "in contrast to the billiard models , however , they exhibit very rich dependence of chaos measures on both energy and hamiltonian parameters , which opens some new directions of potential research .",
    "* geometrical chaos : attempts have been made to develop techniques that would be able to _ predict _ an approximate value of the regular fraction @xmath150 for an arbitrary choice of the system s parameters and energy . an interesting approach is based on the geometrical method , which reduces the dynamics of the system to free motions of particles in curved space @xcite . a related technique resorts to evaluating the convexity / concavity of the energy contours of the model potential @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that in the gcm ( and/or ibm ) the geometrical method is only partially successful @xcite .",
    "pre - estimation of the degree of chaos in a given system therefore remains one of the major tasks of chaos theory .",
    "* chaos versus symmetry : people keep trying to establish a link of order and chaos with some generalized concepts of symmetry . if such a link exists and is universal , it would interpret partial regularity , as observed in various systems of nature , through some imperfect , fractional dynamical symmetries possessed by these systems .",
    "this led to the ideas of so - called partial dynamical symmetry @xcite and quasi dynamical symmetry @xcite .",
    "although both gcm and ibm are particularly well suited for this kind of research @xcite , its success in connection with chaos is so far only partial .",
    "* implications of chaos : one can step from origins to consequences of chaos , investigating various chaos - assisted phenomena in specific systems . for example , the coexistence of regular and chaotic modes of dynamics turned out to be relevant for transitions between spherical and deformed shapes of nuclei @xcite .",
    "regular dynamics was also shown to play a remarkable role in the emergence of rotational bands in highly excited nuclei @xcite , which suggests that the physics underlying the general phenomenon of adiabatic separation of intrinsic and collective motions in many - body systems might be closely related to chaos theory .",
