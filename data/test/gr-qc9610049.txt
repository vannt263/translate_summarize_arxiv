    "between the 1940s and the early 1960s , several researchers proposed the possibility of measuring the retardation of gravitational interaction using laboratory experiments @xmath4 $ ] . because of the poor technology at that time and contradictory theoretical predictions about the retardation , interest in the subject declined .",
    "no experiments were performed during this period , and after 1962 , the topic was never discussed again in the literature . at the 1996 virgo conference ,",
    "a new experimental set - up was described for the purpose of testing the retardation of gravitational interaction in the immediate vicinity of a vibrating mass distribution @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "discussions following the talk indicated that there is still ambiguity about the existence of such a retardation . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss the common arguments which lead to the conclusion that gravitational forces generated by oscillating mass distributions are instantaneous in the near - field .",
    "all of these arguments have the weakness that they are not valid at extremely small distances from the oscillating source .",
    "we will analyze the gravitational forces in the immediate vicinity of a specific oscillating mass distribution , for which the dominant part of the corresponding linearized einstein equations can be solved .",
    "it shows that there is a possibly detectable retardation of the gravitational forces in the immediate vicinity of the source , which converges to zero with increasing distance . the dominant length scale for the decay of the retardation",
    "is given by the _ oscillation amplitude _ of the mass distribution and can be very small .",
    "experimental verification of this local retardation effect would provide the first direct observation of propagating gravitational fields .",
    "we propose a laboratory experiment which requires a highly accurate phase measurement to test our result . given the state of modern technology , this measurement may now be possible .",
    "we consider an idealized experiment in a laboratory environment , consisting of a mass - balanced , mechanical two - body oscillator , which generates disturbances in the space - time metric .",
    "the oscillator consists of a point mass @xmath6 which is connected by way of a spring with negligible mass to a second point mass @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting mass - spring system oscillates with eigenfrequency @xmath8 about its center of gravity , and does not interact dynamically with additional , external masses .",
    "the distance between the masses @xmath6 and @xmath9 is assumed to be much larger than the oscillation amplitude @xmath10 of the smaller mass @xmath6 .",
    "the oscillation amplitude @xmath11 of @xmath9 , which is calculated with classical mechanics , is much smaller than @xmath10 and leads to negligible time - dependent gravitational effects in the immediate vicinity of @xmath6 , as will be shown in section ii.1 .",
    "we will mainly consider the time - dependent gravitational forces generated by @xmath6 , and will thus refer to @xmath6 as the `` source '' , or the `` source mass '' .",
    "another mechanical oscillator , tuned to resonance to detect these gravitational forces , is placed on the oscillator axis at a distance of order @xmath12 from @xmath6 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that the gravitational forces generated in this extreme near - field laboratory experiment are retarded , which may be verifiable with modern technology . due to many objections against experiments of this kind in the past",
    ", we will first discuss the common counterarguments .",
    "the occurrence of a measurable retardation in the proposed system may seem problematic for several reasons .",
    "one may suspect that the theorem about the non - existence of gravitational dipole radiation is violated by the mass - balanced , mechanical two - body oscillator described above .",
    "it states that isolated mechanical systems can not generate any dipolar gravitational radiation , due to momentum and angular momentum conservation within the system @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "however , this argument does not contradict the existence of retarded gravitational forces which are strongly localized around the source .",
    "we will refer to the _ immediate vicinity _ of @xmath6 as a region around @xmath6 with a diameter of order @xmath12 . in section ii.1",
    ", we will prove that the _ time - dependent _ gravitational forces due to the larger mass @xmath9 can be neglected in the immediate vicinity of the source mass @xmath6 , although the static field due to @xmath9 may dominate over the static field generated by @xmath6 .",
    "the mass @xmath6 , which is by itself not an isolated system , appears locally to be an isolated oscillator .",
    "because the momentum of @xmath6 is by itself not conserved , @xmath6 is allowed to radiate gravitationally in its immediate vicinity without contradicting the overall conservation of momentum . at larger distances from the oscillator , the time - dependent gravitational forces due to @xmath9 and @xmath6 have equal strength , and we will show in section ii.2.1 that their radiative contributions cancel .",
    "hence , there is no contradiction to overall momentum conservation .",
    "near - field set - ups similar to the proposed one are usually analyzed with the `` near zone '' limit used in radiation theory , typically defined as a distance range comparable to the wavelength of the radiated signals , which is usually very large . at these large distances from the source",
    ", the vibrating mass distribution can be very accurately modelled as a series of multipole coefficients , which neglect all retardation effects within the source .",
    "but in the immediate vicinity of the source , i.e. at distances comparable to its vibration amplitude , it is not possible to make this simplification .",
    "instead , one must take local retardation effects into account , even if they disappear at large distances .",
    "another common objection against the existence of observable retardations in the proposed set - up arises from an electrodynamic analogy .",
    "retarded electromagnetic potentials may result in almost instantaneous electromagnetic fields , due to certain cancellation effects @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "this phenomenon occurs in the `` near zone '' introduced above , and is consistent with our results .",
    "we will show in section ii.2.2 that the retardation of the gravitational forces decreases _ continuously _ to zero with increasing distance from the source , and that in the immediate vicinity of @xmath6 , the retardation has possibly measurable values .",

    "however , we have assumed cylindrical symmetry in our mathematical model , and thus could find a solution for the dominating gravitational force term . for systems without cylindrical symmetry",
    ", the analysis will be much more difficult . from the results in this section",
    ", we will now discuss how they could be experimentally verified .",
    "(  [ sol ] ) suggests that it may be possible to experimentally verify the retardation of gravitational forces in the immediate vicinity of an oscillating mass distribution .",
    "this would require both the amplitude and phase detection of gravitationally transmitted vibrations . with the previous mathematical model in mind , we propose the following experiment :    a mass @xmath6 within a mass - balanced apparatus is oscillated with a very stable phase and frequency @xmath8 , as described in the mathematical model .",
    "if a mechanical resonator with eigenfrequency @xmath8 , mass @xmath126 , and quality factor @xmath149 is placed at position @xmath236 , it will be driven into resonance by the first harmonic term in the gravitational force . given suitably chosen parameters , the amplitude of the sinusoidally vibrating resonator , typically of the order @xmath237)$ ] , can be detected with modern technology @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "we propose to measure the retardation of the gravitational force in the following way .",
    "place the mechanical resonator at the location @xmath227 on the oscillator axis , such that @xmath238 . from the observed gravitationally induced sinusoidal",
    "vibration , the phase difference @xmath239 between the phase of the resonator and the phase of the vibrating source mass can be measured . if the mechanical resonator is placed at another location @xmath240 on the oscillator axis , a different result @xmath241 will be observed . by subtracting @xmath242 from @xmath243 , all internal influences from the experimental measuring instruments",
    "can be eliminated , resulting in the relative phase shift @xmath244 . the value of @xmath58 in eq .",
    "(  [ phsh ] ) can then be calculated from the measured relative phase shift @xmath245 , which would be the speed of light according to general relativity .",
    "the expected values for the relative phase shift are shown in fig .",
    "3 . since linearized general relativity is formally a special relativistic field theory , measurement of @xmath58 with the proposed system would provide a new test of its lorentz covariance .",
    "moreover , our proposed laboratory experiment would provide the first direct observation of propagating gravitational fields .",
    "in addition , the scalar component of order @xmath103 in eq .",
    "(  [ lineinsteq ] ) also determines the coulomb potential of an oscillating point charge after a substitution of parameters .",
    "therefore , our solution eq .",
    "(  [ sol ] ) also applies to the retarded coulomb force generated by an oscillating point charge .",
    "measurement of the retardation in the immediate vicinity of the charge would thus be another interesting experimental possibility .",
    "since the 1960s , several researchers have detected the amplitudes of gravitationally induced vibrations in laboratory experiments @xmath246 $ ] .",
    "it may be possible that these experiments can be analyzed in a similar way as the model in this paper , which would provide information about the magnitude of the retardation , if present .",
    "the detection of the retardation of gravitational interaction in laboratory experiments has not been discussed much recently because the usual `` near zone '' calculations predict instantaneous interactions , as was shown in section ii . however",
    ", this result does not apply in the immediate vicinity of the oscillating source , as was also shown in section ii .",
    "note that our experiment is not related to the gravitational waves of helicity two , which are far more difficult to detect , since they are of order @xmath60 .",
    "unfortunately , several technical problems must be solved before measurements to test these retardations can be realized . in 1958 , q. kerns demonstrated an analog electronic circuit capable of measuring @xmath247 degree phase shifts @xmath248 $ ] .",
    "we have made several modifications to kerns original design , and we are currently able to measure @xmath249 degree relative phase shifts over a @xmath250 second measurement period @xmath251 $ ] .",
    "currently , the technology is thermally limited , but thermal control of the system and application of noise reduction techniques may soon enable us tho increase the phase sensitivity to the @xmath252 degree phase accuracy required , to measure the retardation to @xmath253 @xmath5 $ ] . it is not yet known if the phase stability of the mechanical systems used for the experiments can be maintained to this accuracy over the measurement time .",
    "using the linearized einstein equations , we have proved that the gravitational force generated by a specific oscillating mass distribution is retarded in its immediate vicinity .",
    "we have proposed an experiment to measure this retardation which may enable the first direct experimental observation of propagating gravitational fields .",
    "the amplitudes of gravitationally induced vibrations in systems similar to ours have been successfully detected since the 1960s .",
