    "the baby - skyrme model is a useful laboratory for studying soliton physics@xcite .",
    "it is the 2 + 1 dimensional analog of the model which describes the low energy chiral dynamics of qcd@xcite , the usual skyrme model@xcite .",
    "the model has direct applications in condensed matter physics@xcite where baby - skyrmions give an effective description in quantum hall systems . in such systems ,",
    "the dynamics are governed by the spin stiffness term , the coulomb interaction and the zeeman interaction . in the relativistic analog of this system",
    "the baby skyrme model is governed by the lagrangian@xcite @xmath0\\label{lbs}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a unit scalar iso - vector field , @xmath2 .",
    "this theory admits stable topological soliton solutions .",
    "the kinetic energy corresponds to the spin stiffnesss term and the mass term corresponds to the zeeman interaction , the correspondence being exact for the static sector .",
    "the skyrme term ( with four derivatives ) is analogous to the coulomb term ( also with four derivatives ) and both serve to stabalize from collapse topological configurations which yield skyrmion solutions . in this paper",
    "we will consider the model arising in the limiting case when @xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds equivalently to @xmath4 with an appropriate rescaling . in the quantum hall system",
    ", this corresponds to the limit @xmath5 ( at finite land @xmath6 factor ) : @xmath7\\label{lbsst}.\\ ] ] we have already introduced this model in our previous letter@xcite , it is our aim in this paper to further elaborate on its properties .",
    "this type of model has been studied by tchrakian _",
    "@xcite for a complex scalar field , with a somewhat modified potential . here ,",
    "for the static sector they have essentially proven that the model is integrable . in their model",
    "there exists a bogomolnyi bound which is saturated and renders the differential equation to be solved first order .",
    "as we shall see below there are certain similarities between the model treated here and their model , however , the corresponding bogomolnyi bound here is not saturated .",
    "hence it is not evident that our model is also integrable for the static sector .",
    "this lagrangian admits the following symmetries .",
    "it is clearly poincar invariant ( lorentz and translational invariance ) .",
    "in addition , because the mass term picks the vacuum direction @xmath8 , the @xmath9 invariance is explicitly broken to @xmath10 , which corresponds to isorotations about @xmath8 : @xmath11    a more interesting symmetry comes from invariance under area preserving diffeomorphisms for the static energy @xmath12\\ ] ] where we see that the vacuum configuration @xmath13 has zero energy .",
    "now if we change the coordinates @xmath14 with an area preserving diffeomorphism @xmath15 then the integration measure does not change and @xmath16 which also does not change since the determinant is 1 .",
    "this symmetry is infinite dimensional , therefore there is an infinite dimensional degeneracy in the energies of the solutions .",
    "intuitively each solution can be deformed like an incompressible fluid to any shape imaginable .",
    "this should also translate into an infinite degeneracy of the ground state in the quantum theory , which is a persistent feature of microscopic models describing quantum hall systems .",
    "we end this section by writing the static energy as follows : @xmath17\\label{bog}\\ ] ] where the extra cross term is a total divergence and vanishes upon integration and : @xmath18 this expression shows that the energy of a solution is always larger or equal to @xmath19 , giving the bogomolnyi type bound of our model : @xmath20    the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "we start with an analysis of the skyrmion type solution , including its quantum rotational spectrum taking into account the deformation due to the centripetal acceleration . to our knowledge",
    "the back reaction of the rotation on the form of the soliton has never been taken into account in obtaining the quantum rotational spectrum .",
    "such an analysis would be most interesting for the skyrme model of nucleons .",
    "we can do so because we can analytically solve the full equations of a steadily rotating baby - skyrmion .",
    "afterwards , we continue with our string solutions , already exhibited in our previous letter@xcite and present closed string solutions which are physically more realistic .",
    "we then present some indications on the low energy scattering of baby - skyrmions .",
    "we end with a section where we consider our model on curved space .",
    "the configuration space of the model is comprised of maps from the plane @xmath21 to the target space @xmath22 .",
    "taking coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 on the target sphere ( corresponding to the usual spherical polar coordinates ) the best known solution is the rotationally symmetric solution given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the usual polar coordinates on the plane .",
    "this yields the ansatz@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an integer , and is equal to the baryon number of the configuration .",
    "@xmath29 has to be @xmath30 at the origin and 0 at infinity to obtain @xmath31 .    replacing ( [ bs ] ) into the energy yields the equation of motion : @xmath32 this complicated non - linear equation , quite surprisingly , can be integrated analytically . by factoring @xmath33",
    "we see that the first 3 terms of the equation are a total derivative .",
    "this yields the equations ( integrated ) @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are integration constants .",
    "finiteness of energy and integer baryon number @xmath38 implies that @xmath29 has to be 0 far from the origin .",
    "usually this is achieved via an exponential or some inverse power of @xmath39 . in our case",
    ", this limit has to be attained in an unexpected fashion .",
    "for some @xmath40 , @xmath41 becomes exactly zero .",
    "this is possible if @xmath42 ( reproducing in ( [ sbs2 ] ) the polynomial generally known as representing a mexican hat ) .",
    "@xmath43 imposes that @xmath44 hence the critical value of @xmath36 is @xmath45 . the function @xmath29 is defined by ( [ sbs2 ] ) only for @xmath46 . for @xmath47",
    "the function obeys equation ( [ sbs1 ] ) : @xmath41 is zero .",
    "this effectively  patches \" the vacuum to the exterior of the soliton . to determine the values of @xmath36 and consequently @xmath48",
    ", we minimize the energy .",
    "we note that since the soliton is of finite size , and neither @xmath29 nor @xmath49 diverge anywhere , the energy of the baby - skyrmion is finite .",
    "physical intuition , verified by explicit computation , tells us that since the energy density is a function of @xmath50 and its first derivative , the total energy is minimum if @xmath50 attains zero at @xmath48 with a zero derivative .",
    "this gives the values @xmath51 and @xmath52 and defines @xmath29 by @xmath53 the energy of the skyrmion can be calculated analytically : @xmath54 this does not saturate the bogomolnyi bound of the model .",
    "the situation is analogous to the skyrme model in 3 + 1 dimensions where it is also possible to find a bogomolnyi bound , which is not staurated by the minimum energy configuration .",
    "there , however , it is possible to define the model on @xmath55 , which allows one to take advantage of the natural geometrical interpretation of the energy functional to saturate the bound by fixing the size of the @xmath55 .",
    "no such interpretation is possible here , as the mass term destroys the symmetry of @xmath22 hence ruining the geometric interpretation .",
    "we show this in detail in the last section .",
    "the fact that the energy is proportional to the baryon number of the solution implies that the energy of 2 sufficiently separated baby - skyrmions of baryon number @xmath56 and @xmath57 is equal to the energy of a localized lump of baryon number @xmath58 .",
    "this gives support to the possibility that there exists a sequence of deformations transforming the two configurations into one another for the case ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this would make possible an analytical analysis of low energy baby - skyrmion scattering .",
    "we will say more about scattering later in this paper .",
    "we end this section on static baby - skyrmions by computing their area .",
    "we find trivially : @xmath60 which is also proportional to the baryon number .",
    "so the area of a @xmath58 baby - skyrmion is equal to the sum of the individual areas of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 baby - skyrmions .",
    "this , together with the energy considerations given above , also points towards a baby - skyrmion baby - skyrmion scattering possibly parametrized by a sequence of area preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "we now consider the problem of a baby - skyrmion spinning ( about the @xmath63 direction ) and the computation of the corresponding ( semi - classical ) quantum spectrum .",
    "the usual assumption in this type of calculation is that the soliton is sufficiently  stiff \" as not to deform enough to significantly modify the energy spectrum .",
    "this  rigid rotor \" approximation has been used frequently but seldom checked , since this requires the ability to compute the instantaneous soliton profile for any angular velocity ( which is no easy task even in a purely numerical framework ) .",
    "this problem was first analysed by piette _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the full model ( including kinetic term ) .",
    "they computed numerically the deformation and energies of spinning baby - skyrmions .",
    "we will see that our model possesses analytical solutions for spinning baby - skyrmions and this enables us to obtain the semi - classical approximation to the quantum rotation energy spectrum of the baby - skyrmion taking fully into account the deformation necessary to produce the force which maintains the centrifugal acceleration .",
    "the obvious ansatz for a rotating baby - skyrmion is given by @xmath64 this ansatz has already been used by wilczek and zee@xcite to explore the connection between fractional spin and exotic statistics , and by piette _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will proceed in the following manner .",
    "we first extract the instantaneous profile of the soliton as a function of @xmath65 from the expression of the energy which then enables us to compute ( in principle ) the ( instantaneous ) moment of inertia and total energy of the soliton .",

    "this behaviour is as expected since , for example , a block of rubber would react to a steady rotation by increasing its energy faster than a rigid rotor .",
    "the surprising behaviour that we find is that @xmath70 is a decreasing function of @xmath65 and there is a @xmath94 after which there is no solution of this type . even though the size of the baby skyrmion decreases , its energy and moment of inertia increase .",

    "it is in the solution of equation ( [ qc ] ) that the deformation of the soliton  interacts \" with its rotation , representing the action of the system which chooses its shape to achieve a quantum state .    in the case of the rigid body ,",

    ", @xmath107 is larger than @xmath89 , making the @xmath105 smaller than the corresponding rigid body solution .",
    "then the net effect of the deformation will be to shorten the gap between sequential energy levels .",
    "we show both spectra in figure 4 .",
    "we observe that the rigid body approximation is acurate for the first few levels , followed by a marked divergence .",
    "since there does not exist baby - skyrmion type solutions for @xmath108 the rotational energy spectrum of figure 4 contains a finite number of quantum levels for the soliton .",
    "the number of those levels depends on @xmath71 and @xmath28 and is easily shown to be : @xmath109 in the case of the full baby - skyrme model , piette _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found the classical rotational spectrum of the baby - skyrmion .",
    "they showed that two regimes existed according to the relative size of the angular velocity @xmath65 and pion mass @xmath71 : if the baby - skyrmion spins too quickly the solution of the equation of @xmath29 becomes oscillatory at infinity , rendering the baby - skyrmion s energy and moment of inertia infinite .",
    "they also showed that a baby - skyrmion  cranked \" that high will quickly reduce its energy and angular velocity by emitting pion radiation until @xmath110 , which is the  steady rotation \" regime . in our case ,",
    "the size of the baby - skyrmion actually decreases with @xmath65 but the polynomial profile prevents any oscillatory or long range behaviour of the function @xmath29 .",
    "there is an @xmath94 after which there is no solution of this form .",
    "we end this section by stressing that the quantum states so obtained are not eigenstates of spin @xmath111 , nor isospin @xmath112 , but of the sum @xmath113 of these operators .",
    "this is due to the fact that the baby - skyrmion is only invariant under the diagonal group spin / isospin .",
    "thus the tower of states constructed would be exactly the same if we had considered iso - rotations about the 3 axis .",
    "the quantization we have followed treats the solitons as bosons .",
    "a more general quantization as anyons is possible , as put forward by wilczek and zee@xcite and requires the inclusion of a hopf term .",
    "we will not elaborate on this possibility here .",
    "in a previous article@xcite we introduced the ansatz for extended solutions resembling strings or strips , in the complete baby - skyrme model and related models . here we shall construct a physical state with such strings and compute its energy .",
    "the simplest  physical state \" one can construct with the string is an annulus made by bending the string and closing it .",
    "we refer the reader to ref . [ 7 ] for the details and notations . to do this , one has to re - interpret the coordinate along the string , @xmath114 , as an angle which winds around the origin .",
    "the @xmath114 axis is mapped to a circle of radius @xmath115 and the @xmath116 coordinate becomes radial .",
    "the ansatz that we use is @xmath117 @xmath118 where @xmath119 represents the inner part of the annulus ( @xmath120 ) and @xmath121 the outer part ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "we have deliberately generalised the ansatz by winding @xmath119 @xmath28 times and @xmath121 @xmath123 times around the origin .",
    "there is no boundary problem since @xmath124 no matter the values of @xmath28 and @xmath123 .",
    "the baryon number of the annulus is the sum @xmath125 where @xmath28 and @xmath123 are both non - zero integers ( although their sum can be zero ) .",
    "we now compute the energy and profile for the annulus .",
    "the procedure to follow is exactly the same as before with the exception that we have two functions to compute : one , @xmath126 , for the inner part of the annulus , and the other , @xmath127 , for the outer part .",
    "the corresponding differential equations are coupled together by the parameter @xmath115 .",
    "one finds the  inner \" solution @xmath126 : @xmath128 where @xmath129 and the ",
    "outer \" solution",
    "@xmath127 : @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "this solution has energy @xmath132 and area @xmath133 which is independent of the parameter @xmath115 , for the same reason that the area of the string was independent of its length @xmath134 .",
    "indeed a large radius @xmath115 implies a very thin annulus while a smaller @xmath115 implies a thicker annulus .",
    "finally there is a minimum @xmath115 for which @xmath135 and the annulus becomes a disc however with a different configuration inside with respect to the baby - skyrmion .    before ending this section",
    "let us make a few remarks .",
    "first , the energy of the solution does not change if we ",
    "move \" the baryon number from the inner part of the annulus to the outer as long as the total @xmath125 does not change ( for both @xmath28 and @xmath123 positive ) .",
    "this generates another degeneracy in the energy spectrum .",
    "second , in order for @xmath136 to be real , one has to ensure that @xmath137 , implying that a solution of large baryon number must have a large radius @xmath115 , or that most of its baryon number ( and energy ) must be stored in the outer shell of the annulus .",
    "third , the state with @xmath138 is different from the baby - skyrmion with @xmath139 in that it actually contains the vacuum in its interior : @xmath140 for @xmath141 .",
    "we see that in the @xmath142 sector for example , we have 2 different lumps degenerate in energy : the @xmath143 baby - skyrmion , or ",
    "deuteron \" , and the @xmath144 annulus .",
    "we remind the reader that the deuteron can not be considered analogous to the annulus since @xmath145 at its center .",
    "we will give an indication in the next section as to the importance of these states in baby - skyrmion scattering .",
    "we use the method of manton@xcite while exploring the symmetries of the deuteron state in the usual 3 + 1 dimensional skyrme model and the symmetries of scattering states .",
    "his method was based on the fact that looked from a distance , a skyrmion resembles a triad of orthogonal dipoles .",
    "@xcite showed that similarly baby - skyrmions look like a pair of orthogonal dipoles .",
    "one way to see this is to use the @xmath146 parametrisation and the constraint @xmath147 . using the constraint to eliminate ,",
    "say , @xmath148 one can describe a baby - skyrmion configuration completely with the fields @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "let us now consider the region of the plane defined by @xmath151 .",
    "since the baby - skyrmion field is radial when projected in the @xmath152 plan , in this region @xmath149 will be very small , while @xmath150 will dominate and be positive . in the opposite region ( @xmath153 ) , it is the same situation but now @xmath150 dominates while being negative .",
    "so the field @xmath150 , which falls at infinity as an exponential in the full model , represents from a far , a dipole oriented parallel to the @xmath114 axis .",
    "the same is valid for @xmath149 except along the @xmath116 axis .",
    "the baby - skyrmion is thus constructed from a pair of orthogonal dipoles ( see @xcite for a more rigorous demonstration of the dipole nature of the field of the baby - skyrmion ) .",
    "it was mantons@xcite idea to show that the natural evolution of these dipoles during a skyrmion - skyrmion scattering with relative orientation 180@xmath154 ( the so - called most attractive channel ) is compatible with a 90@xmath154 scattering .",
    "this was based on the observation that the discrete symmetries under reflection of the skyrmion fields were conserved throughout the scattering .",
    "he also put forward the hypothesis that the deuteron state , which is the expected intermediate state of the scattering , possesses a cylindrical symmetry around the axis perpendicular to the scattering plane , englobing the discrete symmetries mentioned .",
    "a similar reasoning should also be valid in the full baby - skyrme model , and numerical simulations have concurred with the 90@xmath154 scattering and an intermediate state made up of a @xmath143 baby - skyrmion for the case of 2 baby - skyrmions with a relative iso - rotation of @xmath155 around the @xmath63 axis@xcite .",
    "this is also completely consistent with mackenzies@xcite theorem which proves under very general and reasonable assumptions that head on , geodetic scattering of identical particles must be through 90@xmath154 if the coincident point is attained .",
    "scattering with different relative orientations has also been studied , as we will discuss in more detail later .    in our case",
    ", we do not have any dipole picture since our solitons have finite size and the  long range \" interactions are not well approximated by a linear theory of massive or massless pions .",
    "what we have here are well determined regions where @xmath149 or @xmath150 dominate clearly ( we represent these regions by a circle containing a  + \" or  - \" sign , as in manton s notation . see figure 5 for a picture of a baby - skyrmion , and one that has been rotated by @xmath155 around the @xmath63 axis ) .",
    "this does not keep us from using manton s framework .",
    "if anything , the finite and exactly free nature of our solitons render exact for a pair of baby - skyrmions the analog of the approximate , discrete symmetries of a pair of usual skyrmions , even when the baby - skyrmions are at a finite distance from one another ( in fact , anytime that they do nt actually touch each other ) .",
    "we now turn to the scattering of baby - skyrmions without a relative iso - rotation .",
    "this case was not discussed by manton , but treated numerically by piette _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the full baby - skyrme model .",
    "they find 0@xmath154 or 180@xmath154 scattering .",
    "these cases are actually indistinguishable from just the scattering data !",
    "figure 6 shows the  dipole image \" of a pair of baby - skyrmions without any relative iso - rotation for both fields @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "one can easily verify that this configuration transforms according to @xmath156 which are actually just the symmetries of a single baby - skyrmion .",
    "these symmetries are not shared by a pair of baby - skyrmions moving away along the @xmath114 axis so we conclude that the most probable scattering process is 180@xmath154/0@xmath154 collisions . but what could be the intermediate state of the collision ? we know that it can not be the deuteron since it does not transform according to ( [ symlac ] ) .",
    "in fact the only @xmath142 state we know of which possesses the right symmetries is the @xmath142 annulus described in the preceding section , wich is degenerate in energy with both the deuteron and a pair of separated @xmath157 baby - skyrmions .",
    "we might then speculate that this annulus could be the intermediate state arising in the 180@xmath154 or 0@xmath154 scattering .",
    "it would be interesting to actually compute the energy of this annulus state in the full baby - skyrmion model and to look for this state by studying numerically the scattering between unrotated baby - skyrmions .",
    "we end this article by briefly studying the properties of the baby - skyrmion of our model when put on a curved space , namely on a 2-sphere of radius @xmath158 parametrized by the angles @xmath67 and @xmath159 where @xmath160 $ ] and @xmath161 $ ] .",
    "our aim is to study the properties of a dense system of baby - skyrmions , like when put on a regular 2-dimensional array .",
    "the same procedure was followed by n.s .",
    "@xcite in the case of the usual skyrme model in 3 + 1 dimensions without a mass term , where ordinary space was compactified into a 3-sphere .",
    "they showed that below a critical radius of the 3-sphere , the solution of lowest energy is not the skyrmion but a configuration with uniform energy density , and recognized there chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "this makes sense since the skyrme model is related to qcd in the limit of a large number of colours .      when replacing the ansatz for the baby - skyrmion on a 2-sphere @xmath162 into the equation of motion of the lagrangian on a space - time of metric @xmath163 ( in our case @xmath164 ) given by @xmath165 we find the following analytical solution : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the  size \" of the solution on the 2-sphere and is given by @xmath168 this solution has again compact support and finite size and can only exist for @xmath169 in order for @xmath167 to be real .",

    "the energy of the solution is obtained by replacing equation ( [ bss2 ] ) in the general expression for the energy in curved space .",
    "we find : @xmath173 which is surprisingly independent of @xmath158 , and hence , equal to the energy of the baby - skyrmion in flat space .",
    "if we want to reduce still the radius of the 2-sphere , we have to relax the constraint that @xmath174 be 0 at the edge of the soliton .",
    "the derivative will then be discontinuous at that point but the energy , being only function of the first derivative of @xmath175 , will not diverge . the so - called  compressed \" baby - skyrmion solution , existing only for @xmath176 , is also obtainable analytically : @xmath177\\label{bscs2}\\ ] ] this solution completely fills the 2-sphere and has energy : @xmath178 which diverges if @xmath179 . the former happens because of the 4 derivatives of the skyrme term combined with the integration measure and illustrates that a point soliton will have infinite energy .",
    "of course , the energy of the two solutions will become equal in the limit where @xmath180 .",
    "we now want to compare the energy of these solutions with the energy of the configuration with uniform energy density . because of the presence of the mass term in the lagrangian , this type of configuration is not a solution of the equations of motion .",
    "this was not the case in the work of manton _ et al _",
    "@xcite since they did not include any mass term to stabilize the solitons against scale changes of the coordinates . in our case , with @xmath181 and the baby - skyrmion ansatz , we find the following energy : @xmath182 which is always higher in energy than the baby - skyrmion .",
    "we see that there is no phase transition between the two states as @xmath158 changes values .",
