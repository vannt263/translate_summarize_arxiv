    "the most luminous long - lived sources of radiation in the cosmos  active galactic nuclei ( agn )  are powered by gas falling from an accretion disk into a super - massive black hole ( smbh , @xmath2 times more massive than the sun ) at their centre @xcite .",
    "the most exotic agn are blazars , a class defined by wild variability of flux of non - thermal radiation from radio to @xmath0-ray energies",
    ". members of this class include bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) , and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq , the high power version of the former ) .",
    "the remarkable properties of blazars include superluminal apparent motions as high as @xmath3 or more @xcite , substantial changes in flux and linear polarization on time scales as short as hours , and extremely variable @xmath0-ray luminosities that can exceed those at other wavebands by as much as 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "these phenomena are caused by relativistic jets of highly energized , magnetized plasma that are propelled along the rotational poles of the smbh - disk system @xcite .",
    "agn jets pointing within @xmath4 of our line of sight beam their radiation and shorten the variability time scales to give blazars their extreme properties .",
    ", width=377 ]    explaining the location of the @xmath0-ray emitting regions in blazar jets remains one of the greatest current challenges in high - energy astrophysics . having a good knowledge of such location is essential to shed new light on other fundamental questions such as : what is the origin of the seed photons responsible for such @xmath0-ray emission ?",
    "what is the emission mechanism producing the high energy emission ? or what is the extragalactic relativistic jet composition at different distances from the smbh ( electromagnetic , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and how does it change between them ?",
    "there are essentially two main locations of the @xmath0-ray emission in blazar jets that are usually claimed in the literature ( * ? ? ?",
    "one of them  the _ near site _ , from @xmath7 to @xmath8pc from the central engine  has been the scenario considered until recently . this region , inside the broad line region of agn ( blr ) , is embedded by the blr s optical  uv photon field that can be scattered to @xmath0-rays by relativistic electrons in the jet plasma .",
    "this inverse compton emission process can be treated by existing multi  spectral",
    " range emission models .",
    "the near site has been frequently invoked to explain the short time - scales of @xmath0-ray variability of a few hours ( or less ) reported in some blazars ( * ? ? ? * e.g. ) .",
    "this is however not always a good argument , because causality arguments only imply that short time scales are related to small emission regions , not that such emission regions should be at any particular location .",
    "another argument in favor of the @xmath0-ray emission being produced in the near site region is that if the @xmath0-ray emission is produced within the blr , it is possible to explain the sharp breaks at a few gev seen in the @xmath0-ray spectra of _ some _ blazars by opacity to pair production by ( hydrogen and helium ) emission lines in the broad line region ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) .",
    "however , there is an increasing number of blazars for which the @xmath0-ray and radio - mm jet emission sites  the latter at several parsecs far from the smbh ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , where the jet starts to be visible at millimeter wavelengths with vlbi seem to be co - spatial @xcite .",
    "this is the _ far site _ scenario , where the radiation field from the blr is not relevant this scenario is also invoqued to explain , the correlation found between the @xmath0-ray flux and the radio and mm flux in large blazar samples ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the physical conditions of blazar jets are so extreme , theoretical progress in understanding them depends on guidance from comprehensive observational programs that study blazars in a variety of ways .",
    "the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope ( _ fermi _ hereafter ) , the new @xmath0-ray observatory launched by nasa in mid 2008 , represents a revolution in time coverage , energy range , sensitivity , and angular resolution with regard to its predecessor , the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) .",
    ", width=491 ]    since 2008 , several international consortia have been devoting their efforts to support _ fermi _ observations at all other accessible spectral ranges . among such monitoring programs",
    "the boston university blazar monitoring program routinely observes 34 bright @xmath0-ray blazars with monthly time sampling at the highest possible angular resolution at mm observing wavelengths , with the very long baseline array ( vlba , in the usa ) , and with global millimetre vlbi array ( gmva , composed of 5 european mm stations plus the vlba ) .",
    "millimeter vlbi optimally images the innermost regions of jets in blazars where mm emission is not strongly affected by synchrotron opacity , nor faraday rotation of the polarized emission .",
    "moreover , this data set is complemented , within the collaboration , by single dish radio and mm observations ( including the iram 30 m telescope ) , and optical polarimetric observations ( with telescopes at the lowell , calar alto , st .",
    "petersburg state university , steward , and crimean observatories ) , plus a number of other non polarimetric telescopes , with time samplings from a few to many observations per month for each object .",
    "these are complemented with past rxte x - ray observations ( time sampling @xmath9 week ) of some of the brightest sources and with daily sampled @xmath0-ray light curves by the _",
    "observatory , which ( past and future ) data became public from august 2009 .",
    "less frequently , observations with the x - ray , uv , and optical swift satellite are also performed . through correlations and measurement of time lags ,",
    "such a program allows the establishment of connections - and therefore relative locations - of the emission at different wavebands , and of associations of the variable emission with bright knots that move down the jet , usually at superluminal apparent velocities .",
    "furthermore , the polarization reveals the degree of ordering and mean direction of the magnetic field , and provides further means for evaluating simultaneous events at different wavebands .",
    "in @xcite , we present the time coincidence in the end of 2008 of the propagation of the brightest superluminal feature detected in ao  0235 + 164 ( qs ) with an extreme multi - spectral - range ( @xmath0-ray to radio ) outburst , and an extremely high optical and 7 mm ( for qs ) polarization degree , which provides strong evidence supporting that all these events are related ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is confirmed at high statistical significance by probability arguments and monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "these simulations show the unambiguous correlation of the @xmath0-ray flaring state in the end of 2008 with those in the optical , millimeter , and radio regime , as well as the connection of a prominent x - ray flare in october 2008 , and of a series of optical linear polarization peaks , with the set of events in the end of 2008 .",
    "the observations are interpreted as the propagation of an extended moving perturbation through a re - collimation structure at the end of the jet s acceleration and collimation zone , and locate the @xmath0-ray and lower frequency emission in flares of the bl  lac object ao  0235 + 164 at @xmath1pc in the jet of the source from the central engine .      in @xcite , the correlation between the brightest @xmath0-ray and mm flares",
    "is also found to be statistically significant .",

    "f__ermi - lat , that we report in that paper happened at the rising phase of two exceptionally bright mm flares accompanied by sharp linear polarization peaks ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the vlba images show that these mm flares in total flux and polarization degree occurred in a jet region at @xmath11pc from the innermost jet region .",
    "the time coincidence of the brighter @xmath0-ray flare and its corresponding mm linear polarization peak evidences that both the @xmath0-ray and mm outbursts occur @xmath11pc from the central black hole .",
    "we find two sharp optical flares occurring at the peak times of the two reported @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "all this is interpreted as the @xmath0-ray flares being produced by synchrotron self - compton scattering of optical photons from the flares triggered by the interaction of moving knots with a stationary conical shock in the jet .",
    "we have presented the results obtained from the bl lac objects oj  287 and ao  0235 + 164 through multi - spectral range monitoring data from the bu blazar monitoring program . in both cases ,",
    "the analysis of these comprehensive data sets support without inferences from any kind of modeling , but just from the interpretation of the observing data that the high energy @xmath0-ray flaring emission is produced in the relativistic jets associated to these sources and at large distances ( @xmath12pc ) from the corresponding central smbhs , hence supporting the _ far site _",
    "scenario for the generation of @xmath0-ray emission in flares .",
    "this evidence rejects the possibility of production of @xmath0-ray emission in flares as produced by seed photons from the broad line region in oj  287 and ao  0235 + 164 , which bl lac type nature also prevents from displaying prominent emission from the broad line region . moreover , the fact that both oj  287 and ao  0235 + 164 are classified as bl lac objects  for which no ir emission from the dusty torus surrounding the agn has been detected so far disfavors an scenario where the @xmath0-ray emission is produced by the inverse compton process by upscatering of the dusty - torus photon field . in @xcite , we provide further arguments against this latter scenario for ao  0235 + 164 ( but see @xcite ) .    therefore ,",
    "both for oj  287 and ao  0235 + 164 , we favor a mechanism for the generation of prominent @xmath0-ray emission in flares where the seed low energy photons upscatered to @xmath0-rays come from the synchrotron emission radiated from the jet s plasma , which is a third natural source of optical ",
