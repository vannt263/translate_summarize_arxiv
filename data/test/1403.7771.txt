    "the study of resonances in scattering systems with chaotic classical dynamics is an active field of research .",
    "it is at the same time driven by physicists being interested in the quantum properties of open chaotic systems as well as by mathematicians being interested in geometric analysis and partial differential equations ( pde ) on non - compact manifolds . while in scattering theory , resonances are poles of the scattering matrix and correspond to quasi - stationary quantum states with purely in- or outgoing boundary conditions , from the pde point of view resonances are often seen as the spectral invariants defined as the poles of a meromorphic continuation of the resolvent operator .    aside from some very special exceptions ( e.g. the walsh quantized baker map @xcite ) the position of the resonances of such complex systems can not be determined exactly .",
    "it has , however , been a very successful approach to gain coarser information on general properties of the resonance distribution in terms of the underlying classical dynamics and geometry , respectively . for example results on spectral gaps @xcite predict resonance free regions and the fractal weyl law",
    "@xcite gives an upper bound on the growth of the number of the so - called `` long - living '' resonances in the high frequency limit . despite the large progress that has been made in obtaining rigorous results on the distribution of the resonances , there are still many open questions ( we refer to @xcite for an overview over recent results and open questions ) . for example",
    "the upper bound on the exponential growth of the resonance density which has been proven in the fractal weyl law @xcite is only conjectured to be sharp and there exists also a conjecture on the improvement of the spectral gap estimates @xcite .",
    "it has thus been a very important approach to study the resonance structure numerically and by physical experiments in order to test the present conjectures and to show that the results on resonance distributions can be observed in real physical systems .",
    "there have been established two paradigmatic scattering systems for these kind of tests : the @xmath0-disk systems and schottky surfaces .",
    "a @xmath0-disk system describes the scattering of one particle at @xmath0-circular obstacles in the euclidean plane ( see ) .",
    "it has been introduced by gaspard - rice @xcite and cvitanovi - eckhardt @xcite in physics and by ikawa @xcite in mathematics . in physics",
    "especially the completely symmetric 3-disk system , where 3 disks of the same size are arranged on a regular triangle , enjoys great popularity .",
    "it is already complex enough to have a classical dynamic with a non - trivial , fractal repeller and is still simple enough to be treated efficiently by numerics .",
    "there exist very efficient approaches to calculate the quantum resonances based on a direct scattering matrix ansatz @xcite as well as by a semiclassical approach using zeta functions @xcite .",
    "consequently it has been among the first systems to numerically observe the fractal weyl law @xcite .",
    "further importance arises from its experimental realizability @xcite and in recent microwave experiments the spectral gap @xcite and first hints of the fractal weyl law @xcite have been found . from a mathematical point of view",
    "the disadvantage of the @xmath0-disk system is that many of the numerical algorithms are not based on mathematical rigorous results .",
    "for example the conjecture that the zeros of the semiclassical zeta function are related to the quantum resonances , which has been thoroughly tested in physics @xcite , is mathematically open ( cf .",
    "* section 1.6 - 1.8 ) for recent results into this direction ) .",
    "this is the reason for the popularity of schottky surfaces as an explicit model system in mathematics .",
    "schottky surfaces are two - dimensional non - compact surfaces with constant negative curvature which are convex co - compact ( see for a sketch of a 3-funneled schottky surface ) .",
    "the constant negative curvature allows to prove that the zeros of the selberg zeta function are related to the resonances of the laplacian @xcite and not only approximately as conjectured for the 3-disk system in physics .",
    "furthermore jenkinson - pollicott @xcite derived , analogously to the cycle expansion of the 3-disk system , efficient formulas to numerically compute the zeros of the selberg zeta functions .",
    "the big drawback of these surfaces from the physical point of view is that there is no known experimental realization ( see @xcite for attempts to realize the wave equation on negatively curved surfaces with water waves ) . as the curvature of these surfaces is , however , strictly negative , the geodesic flow is hyperbolic and these surfaces are an interesting model for open chaotic systems .",
    "additionally the study of the resonances on constant negative curvature surfaces and the relation to their geometry is a mathematically interesting question itself ( see e.g. @xcite ) thus we will call these resonances _ geometric resonances_. the most simple example of schottky surfaces which already has a non - trivial fractal repeller are the 3-funneled surfaces as shown in the upper part of . for these surfaces",
    "borthwick recently presented a thorough numerical study of their resonances structure @xcite .",
    "one of the most surprising features of this resonance structure is an observation which has before already been made for the 3-disk system @xcite : even though the underlying classical dynamic is completely hyperbolic , i.e.  strongly chaotic , the distribution of the resonances is highly ordered and the resonances form a striking chain structure in the complex plane ( see ) .",
    "the 3-disk system and the schottky surfaces are , however , not the only systems to embody these chain structures .",
    "very similar chains have for example also been observed in higher dimensional systems , as the 4-sphere billiard @xcite , and even in microdisk resonators which are important models for physical applications such as microdisk lasers @xcite .",
    "furthermore the phenomenon of resonance chains is not only restricted to resonances of the laplace operator and quantum resonances , respectively .",
    "also the spectrum of the classical ruelle resonances which describe the decay of correlations in classical dynamical systems has been reported to reveal these clear resonance chains @xcite .",
    "( upper right ) and the quantum 3-disk system with @xmath1 ( lower ) .",
    "note : the resonances for the schottky surfaces are so dense that they appear as continuous lines in the plot above , however , they are discrete ( see ) . , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    though these chains are eye - catching , little is known about these structures . for the completely symmetric 3-disk system and the completely symmetric 3-funneled schottky surface ,",
    "the distance between the resonances on one chain has been observed to be related to the length of the shortest periodic orbit @xcite .",
    "additionally the oscillation length of the chains has been found to be related to the length difference between two fundamental periodic orbits .",
    "recently a numerical study of the 3-disk system @xcite showed that the resonance chains are not only a visual effect , but that the resonances on one chain share common physical properties .",
    "it was , however , shown that the resonance chains are not caused by scarring of the scattering states along individual classical orbits , but are related to the interatction of several classical orbits .",
    "two fundamental questions are , however , still open and will be addressed in this article .",
    "first of all the resonance chains , are a visual impression , i.e.  our brain groups the resonances to different chains and we have the impression that they are strung along different continuous lines . in this article",
    "we will give a system intrinsic definition of these continuous lines .",
    "secondly , resonance chains have been observed in many , quite different systems .",
    "we will give a unifying condition on the classical length spectrum that is able to explain and predict the existence of resonance chains .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section  [ sec:3-disk ] we treat the resonance chains of the symmetric 3-disk system .",
    "after a general introduction of 3-disk systems ( section  [ sec : intro_3-disk ] ) we will numerically illustrate that the resonance chains of the symmetric 3-disk system are created by fast rotating eigenvalues of a suitable transfer operator on the canonical poincar section .",
    "this idea applies for the semiclassical as well as for the classical resonances ( section  [ sec : rot_res ] ) .",
    "then we give an introduction to schottky surfaces ( section  [ sec : intro_schottky ] ) and show in section  [ sec : gen_zeta ] that a straightforward application of this idea on the resonance spectrum of completely symmetric schottky surfaces fails to explain the resonance chains .",
    "however , the ideas can be abstracted .",
    "this leads us to the introduction of a generalized zeta function and the generalized spectrum which are shown to be the right objects to describe and understand the resonance chains .",
    "these objects immediately also allow to deal with non - symmetric schottky surfaces and 3-disk systems and also gives a condition for the existence of resonance chains ( section  [ sec : existence_of_chains ] ) . in section  [ sec : num_test ] we will finally test this condition in different cases and use its predictive power to identify systems incorporating different coexistent chain structures .",
    "as this article addresses a physical as well as a mathematical readership we decided to always state clearly which results and relations are known to be true by mathematically rigorous proofs and which results are achieved by physical arguments or experiments .",
    "this will help to keep an overview which parts of the argumentation are based on rigorous arguments and where further mathematical work remains to be done .",
    "this article itself does not claim to derive any rigorous statements either . instead our aim is to gain a universal understanding of the appearance of the resonance chains and to identify the mathematical quantities , which are crucial for their understanding , via numerical investigations . as the question ,",
    "whether a chain structure is visible or not , is mathematically not well posed but depends on the observer of the resonance structure , our condition can not be a _ if and only if _ condition either . the condition established in section  [ sec : gen_zeta ]",
    "is thus an approximate condition and our hypothesis is that the better this condition is fulfilled the clearer the chains will be visible .",
    "this hypothesis is tested and supported by various numerical results presented in section  [ sec : num_test ] .",
    "a rigorouse proof of the existence of resonance will be given in @xcite , where the ideas and insights presented in this article are an essential ingredient .",
    "a 3-disk system describes one free particle in an euclidean 2-dimensional space that scatters at three non - overlapping hard disks @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for further use",
    "we will call the union of the disks by @xmath4 .",
    "classically its trajectories are given by straight lines and hard wall reflections at the disk boundaries @xmath5 ( see left panel of ) .",
    "its quantum dynamics is described by the laplacian @xmath6 with dirichlet boundary conditions at the disk boundaries and its quantum resonances can rigorously be defined as the poles of the resolvent @xmath7 this resolvent , as a map between compactly supported @xmath8 functions and locally @xmath8-integrable functions , is known to extend meromorphically to the @xmath9 where @xmath10 is any line connecting zero with infinity @xcite .",
    "these poles do indeed coincide with the physical scattering resonances i.e.  if @xmath11 is a pole with multiplicity @xmath12 , then there exist @xmath12 solutions of @xmath13 with dirichlet and purely outgoing boundary conditions .",
    "the latter condition means that the solution @xmath14 in polar coordinates @xmath15 can be written asymptotically in the limit @xmath16 as @xcite @xmath17 contrary purely incoming boundary conditions would correspond to @xmath18 here @xmath19 are constant coefficients and for fixed @xmath10 the asymptotic @xmath20 dependence equals the asymptotic dependence of a free particle state with angular momentum @xmath10 .        an important class of 3-disk systems",
    "are those which are completely symmetric . in those systems",
    "all three disks have the same size and the disks are arranged on an equilateral triangle ( see left part of ) .",
    "historically the side length of the triangle is denoted by @xmath21 and the disk radius by @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "these systems are then completely characterized , up to a scaling , by the ratio @xmath23 . as the system is highly symmetric and possesses the symmetry group @xmath3 of the equilateral triangle often the symmetry reduced system",
    "is studied in physics .",
    "this system consists of an open billiard representing the fundamental domain of the 3-disk system ( see light shaded region in the left part of ) .    as already mentioned before the classical time evolution of a particle between two disk reflections is just a linear propagation interspersed with hard wall reflections .",
    "the trajectory of a particle therefore does not depend on the absolute value of its momentum and we can always scale it to @xmath24 .",
    "it is furthermore convenient to get rid of the parts of linear propagation where no complex dynamic takes place and consider only the poincar section of disk reflections . a particle at the boundary of a disk @xmath25 of radius @xmath26",
    "whose momentum is scaled to one , is completely described by its birkhoff coordinates @xmath27 .",
    "they are defined as the arc length @xmath28 $ ] on the disk boundary as well as the projection of the normalized incoming momentum to the unit tangent vector at the disk boundary @xmath29 $ ] ( see ) .",
    "the complete space @xmath30 of the poincar section consists of three copies of @xmath31\\times[-1,1]$ ] .",
    "as the system is open the dynamics are not defined on all @xmath30 , because in many cases a particle with birkhoff coordinates @xmath27 will just escape to infinity after the reflection and will not hit any of the other disks in the future .",
    "we therefore introduce the forward trapped set @xmath32 of order @xmath0 as the set of all points in @xmath30 which will hit at least @xmath0 disks on their future trajectories .",
    "analogously we define the backward trapped set @xmath33 for the time inverted dynamics .",
    "the discrete time dynamics on the poincar section is then a diffeomorphism     in the figure ) and by the projection of the unit momentum vector on the unit tangent vector .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    @xmath34 note that this diffeomorphism only leaves invariant the trapped set @xmath35 which is known to be a fractal subset of @xmath30 if the 3 disks are sufficiently far away from each other @xcite . using this",
    "discrete time dynamics we can define for any smooth function @xmath36 the transfer operator @xmath37 by setting @xmath38 which is an operator with integration kernel @xmath39 in the theory of dynamical systems this function @xmath40 is commonly called the _ potential function _ even if @xmath40 does not at all play the role of a potential in the sense of classical mechanics . with this transfer operator",
    "we can now introduce the zeta function . if we suppose that @xmath41 can be extended to a banach space @xmath42 such that @xmath41 is trace class then we can study the dynamical zeta function associated to the potential @xmath40 which is defined by the fredholm determinant @xmath43 this function is then known to be analytic in @xmath44 and the discrete spectrum @xmath45 of the transfer operator is related to the zeros of the dynamical zeta function by @xmath46 by the explicit form ( [ eq : kernel_transfer_op ] ) of the kernel @xmath47 we can on the other hand formally define the so - called flat trace @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the jacobian of @xmath50 , @xmath51 the iterated product and @xmath52 the set of all fixed points of @xmath50 . by the flat trace we can define in complete analogy to ( [ eq : dynamical_zeta_fredholm ] ) another zeta function by @xmath53 by a standard calculation for zeta functions ( see [ app : product_form ] ) this expression",
    "can be brought to the form @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the set of all _ primitive periodic orbits _ of the map @xmath56 , i.e.  the set of all periodic orbits @xmath57 for which there is no @xmath58 which also fulfills @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore @xmath60 is the discrete time length of this orbit , @xmath61 is the iterated product of the potential @xmath40 along the primitive orbit @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the eigenvalue of @xmath64 whose absolute value is larger than one .",
    "it is important to note that the expressions ( [ eq : dynamical_zeta_flat ] ) and ( [ eq : dynamical_zeta_product_form ] ) only converge absolutely for @xmath65 sufficiently small .",
    "furthermore ( [ eq : dynamical_zeta_flat ] ) directly implies that the zeta function has no zeros in the region of absolute convergence . equations ( [ eq : dynamical_zeta_flat ] ) and ( [ eq : dynamical_zeta_product_form ] ) are thus of no direct use for a calculation of the zeros of the dynamical zeta function .",
    "if one knows , however , that @xmath66 can be extended analytically beyond the region of absolute convergence , its taylor expansion in @xmath44 around zero @xmath67 will automatically converge absolutely on any disk contained in the region of analytic continuation .",
    "this trick has been introduced in physics by cvitanovi and eckhardt @xcite under the name cycle expansion .    from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the biggest challenge is to prove the analytic continuation of the zeta function defined by ( [ eq : dynamical_zeta_flat ] ) and to show that its zeros correspond to the spectrum of @xmath41 .",
    "this is for example possible if one finds function spaces such that @xmath41 is trace class and that its trace in this space equals the flat trace .",
    "then one obtains by the analyticity of the fredholm determinant automatically an analytic continuation of the zeta function .",
    "such results are known for several classes of systems ( for example for real analytic expanding or hyperbolic maps @xcite ) but to our knowledge not in any setting in which the 3-disk system fits .",
    "physicists usually skip this difficulty and test for concrete examples in which regions the cycle expansion numerically converges .",
    "it is then assumed that this region coincides with the region of analytic continuation .",
    "furthermore it is usually assumed that the zeros of the zeta function defined by the flat trace ( [ eq : dynamical_zeta_flat ] ) are eigenvalues of the transfer operator . as there is not",
    "yet a satisfying mathematical theory in the case of the 3-disk system we will also make these assumptions from now on .",
    "for the 3-disk system two particular choices for the potential are of special interest as they lead to the classical zeta function and to the semiclassical or gutzwiller - voros zeta function , respectively .",
    "the return time or return length of a particle at the disk boundary with birkhoff coordinates @xmath68 is defined as the length of the trajectory until the next disk reflection .",
    "this defines a smooth bounded function @xmath69 and we first can consider for @xmath70 the analytic family of potentials @xmath71 plugging this potential into ( [ eq : dynamical_zeta_product_form ] ) we obtain a dynamical zeta function depending on two variables @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the birkhoff sum along this orbit defined by @xmath75 for @xmath76 being an arbitrary point on the orbit @xmath62 .",
    "it is related to the selberg - smale zeta function by @xcite @xmath77 this zeta function is of special interest because its zeros , the so - called ruelle resonances , determine the decay of correlations of the classical dynamical system ( at least for systems where the theory of ruelle resonances is established , for the 3-disk system this is again conjectured to be true , c.f .",
    "this is why these zeta functions have been studied numerically by gaspard and ramirez @xcite for the symmetric 3-disk system where they observed the resonance chains presented in .",
    "using the ideas of @xcite we can also express the gutzwiller - voros zeta function by transfer operators .",
    "we therefore define the function @xmath78 on @xmath79 to be the restriction of the jacobian @xmath80 to the unstable direction which is simply given by the multiplication with a nonzero number .",
    "if @xmath76 is a fixed point of an iteration of the poincar map @xmath81 , then the iterated product of @xmath78 will be exactly the unstable eigenvalue @xmath82 of @xmath83 .    with this function",
    "we define @xmath84 as well as the corresponding fredholm determinants @xmath85 we can then study the quotient @xmath86 for the last equality we used that the poincar map is orientation inverting and consequently @xmath87 which implies that @xmath88 the final expression is related to the so - called gutzwiller - voros zeta function @xcite by @xmath89 it has been numerically thoroughly checked @xcite that the zeros of @xmath90 coincide to a high precision to the quantum resonance which have numerically been obtained by a quantum scattering approach .",
    "it is conjectured that the zeros of the gutzwiller - voros zeta function converge towards the quantum resonances in the semiclassical limit .",
    "this relation @xcite is , however , based on the gutzwiller - trace formula for the quantum propagator beyond the ehrenfest time , and from the mathematical point of view the relation to the quantum spectrum is completely open . for practical purpose",
    "this relation between the zeros of the zeta function and the quantum resonances has , however , a huge advantage because especially in the regime of high energies the calculations of the zeros of @xmath90 via the cycle expansion is much faster than the calculation based on the quantum scattering matrix and it has been exploited in many numerical works on the quantum spectrum @xcite .",
    "we now want to understand the resonance chains for the symmetric 3-disk system via the zeta functions introduced above .",
    "the zeta functions allow to handle the resonance chains for classical ruelle resonances and quantum resonances by the same approach , even though the physical nature of these resonances is completely different .    in both cases",
    "one has a zeta function @xmath91 which depends on two complex variables and the resonances are defined by ( see ( [ eq : gv_transfer_equivalence ] ) ) . in order to emphasize the uniform approach to quantum and classical resonances as well as the geometric resonances on schottky surfaces , we will , however , from now on consider the quantum resonances to be parametrized by @xmath92 which simply leads to a clockwise rotation by @xmath93 of the quantum resonances in the plots . ]",
    "@xmath94 note that for the quantum case we use the hypothesis that the semiclassical and quantum resonances coincide .",
    "we will , however , only use this correspondence for the symmetric 3-disk system in an energy regime , where this correspondence is known to hold with a very high precision @xcite . beside the set of resonances which we have defined to be the zeros in @xmath95 of @xmath91 for fixed @xmath96 it seems also natural to consider for a fixed @xmath97 the zero set in @xmath44 . in order to have a direct physical interpretation of this set we consider the inverses of these zeros and define for",
    "a fixed @xmath97 @xmath98 using the fredholm determinant representation of the classical zeta function @xmath99 one directly identifies @xmath100 which is the spectrum of @xmath101 .",
    "for the semiclassical resonances this identification is slightly more subtle as @xmath102 has been defined as the quotient of two zeta functions .",
    "if we assume , however , that @xmath103 is analytic in a neighborhood of @xmath104 , then the gutzwiller - voros zeta function can only vanish if the nominator of the quotient vanishes , i.e.  if @xmath105 and @xmath106 . note that the analyticity assumption of @xmath103 is not very strong and in the @xmath95-range which we will consider in the sequel it is always fulfilled ( see [ app : top_pres ] )    summarizing , we have the following two objects in the classical as well as in the semiclassical or quantum case : on the one hand we have the resonance spectrum which equals the zeros of the zeta function in @xmath95 for @xmath96 and on the other hand we have for any @xmath97 the discrete set @xmath107 which can be interpreted as the eigenvalues of a transfer operator @xmath108 which is parametrized by a complex number @xmath95 .",
    "obviously @xmath95 is a resonance if and only if the operator @xmath109 has @xmath24 as an eigenvalue i.e. @xmath110 the simple but important observation is now the following : if we start with a resonance @xmath111 of multiplicity one and continuously vary the parameter @xmath95 then we will be able to trace the eigenvalue which was equal to @xmath24 for @xmath112 and which continuously depends on @xmath95 .",
    "we will call this eigenvalue @xmath113 . a closer look in the concrete form of our transfer operators @xmath108 allows us to predict how the eigenvalues will approximately depend on @xmath95 . in the quantum case for @xmath114 as well as in the classical case with @xmath115",
    "we have @xmath116 where @xmath117 is simply the multiplication operator . in the case of the symmetric 3-disk system",
    "the return time is a smooth function which becomes more and more homogeneous the bigger @xmath23 becomes .",
    "assuming as a first order approximation that @xmath118 then @xmath119",
    "if this approximation was exactly true and if we moved with @xmath95 parallel to the imaginary axis , then the eigenvalue @xmath113 would simply rotate around zero on the unit circle . note that by the definition of the resonance set , every @xmath95 value for which @xmath113 crosses the value point 1 on the unit circle is itself a resonance . by this argument",
    "a single eigenvalue of @xmath120 would create a whole chain of resonances , parallel to the imaginary axis.the resonances would be equally distributed along this chain with a distance of @xmath121 . as the return time is in reality not exactly constant one would expect that slight variations deform the chains and also lead to a distance variation between the extremal values of the return time .",
    "it can be checked numerically that it is exactly this mechanism of a rotating eigenvalue of the operator @xmath108 which creates the resonance chains . in this",
    "is visualized for the quantum resonances of the symmetric 3-disk system with @xmath1 .",
    "on the left we can see a plot of the quantum resonances @xmath122 in the complex plane . ] . on the right the spectrum of the transfer operator @xmath123 is presented .",
    "the blue crosses indicate the eigenvalues with @xmath124 for an @xmath95-value which equals the resonance @xmath125 .",
    "as expected we find an eigenvalue which is equal to @xmath24 .",
    "there is also another eigenvalue plotted which corresponds to the second chain which is nearby the chain to which @xmath126 belongs .",
    "there are further eigenvalues of the transfer operator near zero which we did not plot as the convergence of the zeta function becomes more and more complicated the smaller the absolute values of @xmath44 .",
    "the colored points show how the eigenvalue at @xmath24 moves , if the @xmath95 values varies between two resonances @xmath126 and @xmath127 . as suggested by the heuristic arguments above the eigenvalue moves along the unit circle in a clockwise orientation and",
    "creates the next resonances on the chain .",
    "exactly the same can be observed for the classical ruelle resonances of the 3-disk system with @xmath1 ( see ) .    .",
    "the inset shows the chain structure of the resonances on a large domain in the complex plane .",
    "the main plot shows a strong zoom into one chain , such that only few individual resonances are in the plot region ( blue crosses ) .",

    "the inset shows the chain structure of the resonances on a large domain in the complex plane .",

    "these numerical results do , however , not only confirm that the hypothesis that each resonance chain is created by a rotating @xmath108-eigenvalue is true .",
    "they also indicate what the continuous mathematical object is that the resonances are distributed on .",
    "note that taking two neighboring resonances of one chain there are multiple paths to connect these two resonances . while each path will effectively lead to one rotation of @xmath113 around zero , there is only one such path , for which @xmath113 stays on the unit circle .",
    "as it can be seen in such a rotation on the unit circle is obtained if the two resonances are connected along the path which is suggested by the structure of the resonance chains .",
    "if one , however , takes a different path between the two resonances , then the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath108 will turn on a deformed circle around zero ( see for an arbitrary path between the two resonances ) .",
    "we can thus define @xmath131 and from the numerics above we conclude that the continuous object on which the resonances are distributed is given by @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the projection on the @xmath95-component .",
    "we have thus seen in this section that the resonance chains of the classical and the quantum resonances are generated by the same mechanism .",
    "as in both cases the resonances can be seen as the zero set in @xmath95 of a zeta function , which can be represented as a fredholm determinant of a @xmath95-dependent family of operators .",
    "the resonance chains are generated by single eigenvalues of @xmath108 which circle around zero while @xmath95 moves along the chain .",
    "furthermore this approach allows a system - intrinsic definition of a continuous object that coincides with the visually suggested curves on which the resonances are strung together . in the next section we will see how this idea can be extended to the resonance chains on schottky surfaces and examine in detail the question in which systems resonance chains will occur and in which not .",
    "schottky surfaces are a special class of infinite volume riemann surfaces . in this section",
    "we will give a brief introduction to its most important properties .",
    "for a detailed introduction we refer to @xcite .",

    "in this appendix we will recall the derivation of the product form ( [ eq : dynamical_zeta_product_form ] ) from the definition of the dynamical zeta function as it has been defined in ( [ eq : dynamical_zeta_flat ] ) by the flat trace @xmath255 for each fixed point @xmath81 the jacobian is a hyperbolic , symplectic @xmath256 matrix and it thus has two real eigenvalues @xmath82 and @xmath257 with @xmath258 and the determinant can be written as @xmath259 where for the last equality we used that a positive integer @xmath163 can be written as @xmath260 different sums of two positive integers @xmath261 and @xmath95 .    as a next step we can treat the double sum @xmath262 which is simply the sum over all fixed points of @xmath50 for arbitrary length @xmath56 .",
    "first we note that the iterated product of the potential function @xmath263 as well as the instable eigenvalue @xmath82 do not depend on the choice of the fixed point in a fixed orbit @xmath264 .",
    "additionally we see that if an orbit of length @xmath265 is a @xmath12-times iterate of a primitive orbit of length @xmath60 , then the orbit contains @xmath60 fixed points and as well the iterated product as the instable eigenvalue are the @xmath12-th power of the values from the primitive orbit @xmath266 this allows us to write the double sum @xmath262 as a double sum over all primitive periodic orbits and their repetitions @xmath267 and we obtain @xmath268^{k+1}&\\nonumber \\\\ & = \\prod_{k\\geq0}\\prod_{p\\in p}\\left[1-z^{n_p}\\frac{v_{n_p}(x)}{|\\lambda_{n_p}|\\lambda_{n_p}^{k}}\\right]^{k+1}&\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the taylor series of @xmath269 in the last equality .",
    "in this appendix we will shortly recall how the resonance spectrum on schottky surfaces is usually calculated ( see @xcite for more details ) and what modifications have to be performed for the calculation of the generalized zeta function and the generalized spectrum .",
    "usually the resonance spectrum is obtained by taylor expanding ( [ eq : bs_dyn_zeta_fixpoint_formula ] ) in @xmath44 around zero @xmath270 the taylor coefficients are then explicitly given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 8) @xmath271 where @xmath272 are all @xmath261-partitions of @xmath163 , i.e.  all @xmath261-tuples of integers whose sum equals @xmath163 .",
    "the numerical task in order to calculate these coefficients then consists in calculating the stabilities @xmath273 of sufficiently many fixed points . for a 3-funneled schottky surface @xmath154 this can efficiently be done using the generators of the corresponding schottky group and a symbolic dynamic .",
    "for @xmath154 the generators can be written as @xmath274 where the parameter @xmath22 is chosen such that @xmath275 and as usual one writes @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "if we then define the set of words of length @xmath0 by @xmath278 then we can define for each @xmath279 the hyperbolic isometry @xmath280 one then can easily show from the definition of the bowen - series maps ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 15.2 ) that for each @xmath281 there is exactly one @xmath282 and @xmath283 which allows an efficient calculation of ( [ eq : b_k_bowen_series ] ) and thus of @xmath284 .",
    "for the calculation of @xmath250 one analogously has to taylor - expand the zeta function in @xmath44 around zero @xmath285 then one has to calculate the new taylor coefficients @xmath286 .",
    "as we want to use the word coding to calculate the lengths of the geodesics or the stabilities @xmath273 , respectively , we first have to transfer the order function @xmath287 to an order function on @xmath288 .",
    "this transformation can be obtained via the correspondence between closed geodesics on @xmath154 and fixed points of @xmath183 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 15.5 ) . using this identification",
    "one calculates that the order function as defined in ( [ eq : funnel_order_func ] ) is then given by @xmath289 where @xmath290 the bowen - series order function @xmath291 can be translated much more easily . from its definition in section  [ sec : intro_schottky ] it immediately follows , that @xmath292 for all @xmath293 .    using the order function on the words as well as the identification of fixed points and words , equation ( [ eq : bs_dyn_zeta_fixpoint_formula ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath294 starting with ( [ eq : gen_zeta ] ) and reversing the argumentation of [ app : product_form ] the generalized zeta function @xmath250 can be written as @xmath295 an analogous calculation to those in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 8) then gives us the formula for the taylor coefficients @xmath296 the stabilities @xmath297 can be calculated by the generators @xmath298 of the schottky group as described above and in order to simplify the combinatorial task of building together the taylor coefficients @xmath286 from these stabilities we can use the same recurrence trick as presented in @xcite .",
    "we therefore write @xmath299 and @xmath300 we can then use the recurrence relations @xmath301 the only difference in calculating the generalized zeta function compared to the dynamical zeta function of the bowen - series maps thus consists in the modified formula for the functions @xmath302 .    note",
    "that as @xmath250 is analytic the taylor coefficients @xmath286 decay superexponentially in @xmath163 and theoretically one can compute @xmath250 for arbitrary @xmath303 . practically , however , the convergence becomes worse and worse the smaller @xmath304 and the bigger @xmath65 become . especially for order functions ( [ eq : funnel_order_func ] ) with larger values of @xmath305 as they appeared for example for the surfaces @xmath212 the convergence depends very strongly on @xmath65 .",
    "this implies that a reliable calculation of @xmath306 is only possible for @xmath44 values which are slightly greater then @xmath24 . in terms of the generalized spectrum",
    "this implies that the numerical calculation is only possible for @xmath44 slightly smaller then @xmath24 . as the interesting region for",
