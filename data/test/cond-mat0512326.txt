    "the electron liquid is both viscous and compressible ; properties which suggest an intriguing analogy with a classical liquid  @xcite .",
    "this analogy is even more compelling when one recalls that the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation ( tdse ) can be cast , quite generally , in a `` hydrodynamic '' form in terms of the density and expectation value of the velocity operator  @xcite . in the classical case",
    "one can derive time - dependent equations , called navier - stokes equations , for the velocity field of the fluid as a function of its density , visco - elastic coefficients , pressure and the geometric confinement  @xcite .",
    "these equations are centrefold in hydrodynamics and describe both laminar and turbulent regimes .",
    "if we could derive similar equations in the quantum case we would have a powerful tool to investigate a plethora of effects related to electron - electron interactions on a much simpler level than solving for the many - body schrdinger equation .",
    "unfortunately , the derivation of these equations in the quantum case is generally not possible .    in this paper",
    "we show that transport in nanoscale conductors satisfies the conditions to derive quantum navier - stokes equations .",
    "this is simply due to the geometric constriction experienced by electrons flowing in a nanostructure which gives rise to very fast `` collisional '' processes  @xcite . in this regime , we show that one can truncate the infinite hierarchy of equations of motion for the electron stress tensor to second order and thus derive quantum hydrodynamic equations . with these equations",
    "we first rederive conductance quantization in a quasi-1d non - viscous , incompressible fluid thus making the connection between quantum transport and this hydrodynamic picture clearer .",
    "we then predict the conditions for the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) and suggest specific experiments to verify our predictions .",
    "let us start from a general many - body hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the kinetic term , @xmath2 an external potential and @xmath3 where @xmath4 are field operators and @xmath5 is the coulomb interaction potential .",
    "it is well known that the tdse can be equivalently written as two coupled equations of motion for the single - particle density , @xmath6 , and velocity field , @xmath7 , as obtained from the heisenberg equation of motion for the corresponding operators  @xcite .",
    "the single particle density is defined in terms of the field operator as @xmath8 , while the velocity is given by @xmath9 where the current density is given by @xmath10\\rangle/2mi$ ] . for clarity",
    "we rewrite the heisenberg equations of motion here ( summation over repeated indexes is understood ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the convective derivative , @xmath13 the electron mass , and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is a stress tensor , exactly given by the sum of kinetic and interaction stress tensors  @xcite .",
    "the interaction tensor is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the two - particle density matrix and @xmath18 a parameter that defines the geodesic which connects two interacting particles  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , ( [ equationmotion ] ) has an appealing `` hydrodynamic '' form where all many - body information is included in the stress tensor @xmath14 . in order to solve ( [ equationmotion ] ) one",
    "proceeds by calculating an equation of motion for @xmath19 , which can be derived from the heisenberg equation of motion of the particle creation and destruction operators .",
    "however , this equation of motion contains the three - particle density matrix . in turn , the equation of motion for the three - particle density matrix contains the four - particle density matrix and so forth , thus generating an infinite hierarchy of nested equations , making the problem practically unsolvable  @xcite .",
    "we show here that in the case of electrical transport in nanoscale systems we can instead close this set of equations .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "first , let us derive the dependence of the stress tensor @xmath14 on the rate at which the system reaches a quasi - steady state .",
    "we can obtain this dependence from the quantum kinetic equations for the nonequilibrium distribution function @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the momentum ) , which can be derived from the tdse equation with standard techniques ,  @xcite in a co - moving ( lagrangian ) reference frame moving with velocity @xmath7  @xcite @xmath22=&&d_{t}f(r , p ,",

    "the collisional integral contains two terms , one elastic and the other inelastic . in what follows ,",
    "it is important to realize that both terms can drive the system toward a local equilibrium configuration .",
    "the first two moments of the distribution give the density @xmath25 and the condition @xmath26 .",
    "the two - particle stress tensor is related to the distribution function as @xmath27 . similarly ,",
    "higher order moments of the distribution function produce higher order stress tensors . introducing these moments into ( [ kinetic ] ) and comparing with ( [ equationmotion ] ) we can write the stress tensor in terms of the collisional integral @xmath23 according to the equation of motion @xmath28 p_ip_j = d_{t}p_{i , j}+p_{i , j}\\nabla \\cdot v+p_{i , k}\\nabla",
    "_ { k}v_{j } + p_{k , j}\\nabla_{k } v_{i}+\\nabla_{k}p_{i , j , k}^{(3 ) } , \\label{secondmoment}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the three - particle stress tensor . by writing the equation of motion for @xmath29 we would again get an infinite hierarchy of equations .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the theorems of time - dependent density - functional theory establish that the stress tensor @xmath14 is a universal functional of the velocity and density only ( see for example , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the hierarchy of equations for the moments of the distribution function can be formally closed to all orders in the electron - electron interaction .",
    "however , we note that @xmath29 enters in ( [ secondmoment ] ) only through its spatial derivative .",
    "if the latter is small then the hierarchy can be truncated @xcite . from ( [ secondmoment ] )",
    "we easily see that this derivative is small compared to the other terms whenever @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 is the average electron velocity , @xmath32 is the length of inhomogeneities of the liquid that give rise to scattering among three particles , @xmath33 the system proper frequency and @xmath34 the collision rate . the parameter @xmath35 enters through the spatial derivative of @xmath29 , @xmath33 from the frequency dependence of the interactions ( in the dc limit of interest here @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 through the collisional integral @xmath38\\propto -\\nu_c(f - f_0)$ ] , where @xmath39 is the equilibrium fermi distribution .",
    "this derivative is indeed small for transport in nanostructures : when electrons move into a nanojunction they adapt to the given junction geometry at a fast rate , and produce a quasi - steady state and local equilibrium distributions even in the absence of electron interactions  @xcite .",
    "this `` relaxation '' mechanism occurs roughly at a rate @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the typical energy spacing of lateral modes in the junction . for a nanojunction of width",
    "@xmath42 we have @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath42 = 1 nm , @xmath37 is of the order of @xmath45 hz , i.e. , orders of magnitude faster than typical electron - electron or electron - phonon scattering rates .",
    "the condition @xmath46 thus requires the length of inhomogeneities @xmath47 , which is easily satisfied in nanostructures .",
    "note instead that in mesoscopic structures this condition is not necessarily satisfied .",
    "in that case , the dominant relaxation rate @xmath37 is given by inelastic effects , i.e. it is of the order of thz , so that for typical lengths of mesoscopic systems , @xmath48 in the dc limit .",
    "nonetheless , the above condition could still be valid for high - frequency excitations , like plasmons , and/or very low densities , so that stress tensors of order higher than two are negligible .",
    "neglecting @xmath49 in ( [ secondmoment ] ) we can thus derive a form for @xmath14 .",
    "let us write quite generally the stress tensor @xmath14 as @xmath50 , where the diagonal part gives the pressure of the liquid , and @xmath51 is a traceless tensor that describes the shear effect on the liquid . from ( [ secondmoment ] )",
    "we thus find that the tensor @xmath51 can be written as ( in @xmath52 dimensions , @xmath53 ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a real coefficient that is a functional of the density  @xcite .",
    "we point out that ( [ pixcstatic ] ) is in fact a particular case of a general stress tensor with memory effects taken into account  @xcite . in our derivation",
    "this is the first non - trivial term of an expansion of the stress tensor in terms of the density and velocity field .",
    "consequently the navier - stokes stress tensor in ( [ pixcstatic ] ) can be seen as the first - order ( non - trivial ) contribution to the exact stress tensor of the electron liquid ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "using this stress tensor we finally get from ( [ equationmotion ] ) the generalized navier - stokes equations for the electron liquid in nanoscale systems @xmath56 equations  ( [ completens ] ) are formally equivalent to their classical counterpart  @xcite and thus describe also nonlinear solutions , i.e. the possibility to obtain turbulence of the electron liquid in its normal state . in the examples that follow",
    ", we will consider only the case in which the liquid is incompressible so that the viscoelastic coefficients are spatially uniform : this approximation is practically satisfied in metallic qpcs but needs to be relaxed in the case of qpcs with organic / metallic interfaces ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , for this case the hartree potential is constant and its spatial derivative is thus zero .",
    "therefore , ( [ completens ] ) reduce to the navier - stokes equations for the density and velocity of a viscous but incompressible electron liquid @xmath57",
    "let us first show that we can derive from ( [ ns ] ) the quantized conductance of an ideal ( @xmath58 ) quasi-1d liquid .",
    "we consider the electron liquid adiabatically connected to two reservoirs , and we call @xmath59 and @xmath60 the velocity and chemical potential , respectively , in the left ( right ) reservoir , with @xmath61 . from ( [ ns ] ) we then derive the bernoulli s equation that states the conservation of energy @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the enthalpy of the left ( right ) leads ) one makes use of the relation @xmath64 and by projecting the equation of motion on the tangent to the current flow .",
    "the enthalpy is defined as @xmath65  @xcite . in the 1d case @xmath66 and @xmath67 . ] . since we assume the fluid is incompressible @xmath68 . by defining the flow velocity @xmath69 and",
    "the co - moving fermi velocity is the fermi velocity in the reference frame moving with velocity @xmath70 .",
    "obviously the bernoulli s equation is invariant under any galilean transformation . ]",
    "@xmath71 we get from ( [ bernoulli ] ) the relation @xmath72 . by definition ,",
    "the current is given by @xmath73 so that , by using the 1d density of states , @xmath74 , which , in the linear regime , gives the quantized conductance ( per spin ) @xmath75 . if we assume that only a fraction @xmath76 of electrons is transmitted due to the presence of a barrier in the liquid , we can argue that , in linear response , the current is an equal fraction of the current in the absence of the barrier , i.e. @xmath77 . the conductance is thus @xmath78 in accordance with the landauer two - terminal result  @xcite .",
    "corrections to this conductance in the presence of viscosity in 3d have been estimated in @xcite and were found to depend non - linearly on the gradient of the electron density .",
    "corrections to this conductance have been experimentally observed and justified with a hydrodynamical model where the conductance depends on the physical properties of the electron flow @xcite .",
    "we know that the time - independent solutions of the navier - stokes equations  ( [ completens ] ) or  ( [ ns ] ) can describe many different regimes , with the non - linear ( turbulent ) regime generally favoured with respect to the laminar one . in fluid mechanics , in order to identify these regimes , it is customary to define a key quantity , the reynolds number @xmath79 , as the only non - dimensional quantity that can be constructed out of the physical parameters of the system , like the density , the viscosity @xmath55 , etc .",
    "@xcite . in the quantum case",
    "we follow a similar convention .",
    "for instance in 2d we define @xmath79 as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the total mass current , and @xmath23 is the average total electrical current . for small @xmath79 the stable ( and stationary ) flow",
    "is usually laminar while for large @xmath79 the flow is turbulent  @xcite . in the latter case , one should then observe a local velocity field which varies in space in an irregular way , and whose pattern is very sensitive to initial conditions .    _ adiabatic qpcs - _ let us apply these concepts to the transition between laminar and turbulent flow in qpcs .",
    "the microscopic geometry of these structures is quite complicated so that analytical solutions to ( [ ns ] ) can not be generally found .",
    "however , for an adiabatic 2d constriction , the self - consistent confining electron potential which enters ( [ ns ] ) can be approximated with the simple form @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a parameter that controls the rate at which the constriction opens up and @xmath84 is the opening of the constriction [ see inset ( a ) of fig .  [ fig1 ] ] .",
    "we assume electrons either originate from , or enter into , the region @xmath85\\}$ ] of that potential to resurface on the opposite side of the structure . we know from classical hydrodynamics",
    "that , for any constriction , turbulent flow may exist only on the side where the constriction acts as a source of electrons  @xcite .",
    "we will therefore discuss only this side .",
    "we are interested here in the case of @xmath86 large , i.e. true adiabatic limit . since we are dealing with a viscous liquid we assume a no - slip condition at the boundary , i.e. , at the boundary the velocity component parallel to the boundary is zero .",
    "this condition can be relaxed by assuming that the velocity be finite at the boundary : the conclusions would be unchanged . we want to point out , however , that due to the small viscosity of the electron liquid the effective boundary conditions on the electron liquid do not affect considerably its bulk motion .    the analytical stationary solution of ( [ ns ] ) with these boundary conditions is not known",
    "however , one can find an approximate solution by applying the transformation @xmath87 , @xmath88 that maps @xmath82 into @xmath89 , @xmath90 and transforms ( [ ns ] ) in a new set of equations where the parameter @xmath91 appears explicitly .",
    "we can then expand this equation in powers of @xmath91 .",
    "the zeroth order solution has the form @xmath92 , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the @xmath21 @xmath95 component of the velocity in the @xmath96 plane and @xmath97 is an arbitrary constant fixed by the requirement that a certain amount of charge is flowing through the system .",
    "if we transform back to the @xmath98 plane we see that the zeroth order solution is given by @xmath99 , @xmath100 , i.e. , we have obtained the classical poiseuille flow  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the pouiseille flow is stable against small perturbation for almost all reynolds numbers ; the poiseuille flow is laminar up to @xmath101 .",
    "this flow is linearly stable for any @xmath79 , but is unstable for non - linear perturbations at large @xmath79 : turbulent flow can be observed if , e.g. , one could force a large enough current .",
    "numbers shows that the terms of high order appear to be important , and one can not consider only linear perturbations ( i.e. , proportional to the field itself ) . assuming non - linear perturbations",
    ", one can then show that the pouiseille flow is unstable for an _ arbitrary _ ( but small ) perturbation .",
    "this is different from the usual linear perturbation case where the system is stable for _ any _ small linear perturbation . ]",
    "since for an adiabatic constriction @xmath102 ( i.e. , at any given point the system is arbitrarily close to a pipe ) , we conclude that _ in an adiabatic qpc the flow is laminar for almost any value of @xmath79_. we note that compressibility of the liquid may instead provide a lower critical @xmath79 to observe turbulence .",
    "number as a function of the angle @xmath103 of the geometry represented in the inset ( b ) .",
    "inset ( a ) is a schematic of an adiabatic constriction.,width=302 ]    _ non - adiabatic qpcs - _ let us now look at a case where the constriction is non - adiabatic .",
    "a simple non - adiabatic potential for which an analytical solution exists is @xmath104 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] .",
    "microscopically , the point @xmath105 could be , e.g. a molecule sandwiched between two bulk electrodes and current flows from one electrode to the other ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested here in the dynamics close to ( but away from ) this point .",
    "the present problem could also be solved by assuming a finite opening of the potential at the origin , i.e. a potential of the form @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "our conclusions would be unaffected by this finite opening . in the case of the system in fig .  [",
    "fig1](b ) we know there is a critical @xmath79 number , @xmath108 , determined by the angle @xmath109 , above which the laminar flow is unstable .",
    "a simple calculation gives the implicit relation between the angle @xmath103 and @xmath108 @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are elliptic functions and @xmath113 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "this critical @xmath79 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as a function of the angle @xmath103 and separates the phase space in two regions : laminar for @xmath114 , turbulent for @xmath115 .",
    "equation ( [ twoplanes ] ) has been again derived with the no - slip condition at the boundary . a finite velocity at the boundary ( or even a larger velocity at the boundary than at the center of the junction )",
    "would further reduce @xmath108 for any @xmath103 , i.e. it would make the laminar solution even more unstable .",
    "we can thus conclude that turbulence can be observed in this case .",
    "recently the current distribution for a 2deg qpc has been measured  @xcite . an irregular time - independent pattern has been observed and explained by the presence of impurities in the system .",
    "we suggest that turbulent effects could be observed in similar experiments on the 2deg if nonadiabaticity is introduced , e.g. by asymmetric electrodes that would generate a potential of the type represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . in this case",
    "we can predict the dimension @xmath116 of the smallest observable eddies in the turbulent regime .",
    "a simple dimensional analysis gives  @xcite @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the critical current , i.e. , the current which , from ( [ twoplanes ] ) gives @xmath108 , and @xmath119 the linear size of the device .",
    "we easily see that @xmath116 decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath103 .",
    "the viscosity @xmath55 can be evaluated through a perturbation theory on the 2d electron liquid  @xcite .",
    "for a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a gaas heterostructure ( @xmath120 ) with a sheet density of @xmath121 we have , @xmath122 @xcite is about @xmath123 .",
    "assuming a lateral dimension @xmath124 we get @xmath125 hz , i.e. still orders orders of magnitude faster than other inelastic scattering rates in this system . ] . for a typical current of @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "we then expect that a turbulent flow is developed for any angle larger than @xmath128 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath129 ( @xmath130 from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , by assuming a length @xmath119 of a typical device of about @xmath131 , we evaluate the typical dimension of the smallest eddies to be @xmath132 .",
    "our predictions should be thus readily verifiable experimentally .",
    "we finally conclude by noting that the geometry of nanoscale structures , like , e.g. a molecule between bulk electrodes , is actually closer to a conical structure for which the electron liquid is turbulent for relatively small @xmath79  @xcite . the formation of eddies in proximity to an atomic or molecular junction is thus much more likely to occur than in the 2deg case .",
    "moreover , we expect that the finite compressibility of the electron liquid will favour the appearance of turbulent flow .",
