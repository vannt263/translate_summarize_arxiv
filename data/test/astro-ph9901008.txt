    "a giant x - ray outburst of ngc5905 was discovered during the ( trmper 1983 ) survey observation ( bade , komossa & dahlem 1996 ) .",
    "ngc5905 showed a high countrate during this first observation .",
    "the countrate then declined by at least a factor of several within months and was down by a factor @xmath0100 two years later .",
    "the x - ray spectrum during the outburst was very soft ( with photon index @xmath1 when fit by a powerlaw ) . during quiescence ,",
    "the spectrum is flatter ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the outburst luminosity is of the order of @xmath3 several @xmath4 erg / s ; much _ higher _ than observed in _ non - active _ spiral galaxies ( e.g. , fabbiano 1989 , vogler 1997 ) .",
    "new hri data were taken in 1996 with an exposure time of 76 ksec .",
    "these show a further decline by a factor @xmath02 in flux with respect to the last pspc observation . the long - term x - ray lightcurve is displayed in fig",
    "optical observations are an important supplement to the x - ray data .",
    "the two most important questions are ( i ) is there a simultaneous optical outburst , and ( ii ) does the optical spectrum of ngc5905 show any signs of seyfert activity ?      we have used photographic plates taken at _",
    "sternwarte sonneberg _ to produce a long - term optical lightcurve ( between years 1962 and 1995 ) of the nucleus of ngc5905 and searched the plates taken quasi-_simultaneously _ to the x - ray outburst for a correlated optical outburst .",
    "the factor @xmath0100 variability seen in x - rays would corresponds to 5@xmath5 in the optical spectral region in the variable component .",
    "the optical brightness of ngc5905 is found to be _ constant _ within the errors on long terms as well as near the x - ray outburst ( fig .",
    "2 ) , placing strong constraints on outburst scenarios .",
    "we have taken high - resolution post - outburst optical spectra ( about 6 years after the x - ray outburst ) at the 3.5 m telescope of calar alto .",
    "these show the same spectral characteristics as the pre - outburst spectrum of ho et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and classify the galaxy as hii - type . if a high - ionization emission - line component was present during outburst , it had already declined below detectability .",
    "we carefully searched for other signs of _ permanent _ seyfert activity  none are revealed .",
    "this is another important constraint for outburst models and , at present , makes ngc5905 the only non - active galaxy among the x - ray outbursting ones .",
    "the major characteristics to be explained by outburst models are    * short duration , extremely soft spectrum , giant amplitude ( a factor @xmath6 100 ) and huge peak luminosity of the x - ray outburst * no detected simultaneous change in optical brightness * the optical spectrum is that of an hii - type galaxy with _ no _ signs of _ permanent _ seyfert activity    we in turn discuss several outburst scenarios ( for details see komossa & bade 1998 ) .      the outburst x - ray luminosity by far exceeds that of individual supernovae .",
    "those observed in x - rays range between @xmath7 and a few @xmath8 erg / s ( e.g. , schlegel 1995 , immler & pietsch 1998 ) ; the x - ray brightest reached @xmath9 erg / s ( fabian & terlevich 1996 ) .    the possibility of ` buried ' supernovae ( sn ) in _ dense _ molecular gas was studied by shull ( 1980 ) and wheeler et al .",
    "( 1980 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "x - ray emission originates from the shock , produced by the expansion of the sn ejecta into the ambient interstellar gas of high density . since",
    "high luminosities can be reached this way , and the evolutionary time is considerably speeded up , an sn in a dense medium may be an explanation for the observed x - ray outburst in ngc5905 .    assuming the observed outburst luminosity of ngc5905 to be the peak luminosity and using the analytical estimates of shull and wheeler et al . for the evolution of temperature , radius and luminosity of the shock ,",
    "@xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 results in a density of the ambient medium of @xmath13 but is inconsistent with the observed softness of the spectrum : the expected temperature is @xmath14 k , compared to the observed one of @xmath15 k. therefore , an sn in dense medium is an unlikely explanation of the observed x - ray outburst .",
    "additionally , fine - tuning in the column density of the surrounding medium would be required in this scenario in order to prevent the snr from being completely self - absorbed .",
    "large magnification factors of the source brightness can be reached by gravitational lensing ( gl ) if the observer , lens , and source ly nearly exactly on a line .",
    "lensing was , e.g. , discussed as a possibility to explain the observed variability in bl lac objects ( e.g. , ostriker & vietri 1985 ) .",
    "being independent of photon energy , gl predicts the same magnification factor at optical wavelengths as in x - rays . given the non - detection of optical variability simultaneous to the x - ray outburst the gl scenario is very unlikely .      as to the question of whether the observations may have represented the x - ray afterglow of a gamma - ray burst ( grb )",
    ", we note that no grb has been detected in the time around the x - ray outburst ( july 1215 , 1990 ) of ngc5905 ( the 2 reported grbs nearest in time , of july 8 , 1990 , have different positions ; castro - tirado 1994 on the basis of granat / watch data ) .",
    "the possibility remains that the grb escaped detection or that it was not beamed towards us and only the isotropic afterglow was seen .",
    "if a massive bh _ with an accretion disk _ exists in the center of ngc5905 , it usually has to accrete with low accretion rate or radiate with low efficiency , to account for the comparatively low x - ray luminosity of ngc5905 in quiescence .",
    "an accretion disk instability may then provide an explanation for the observed x - ray outburst .",
    "thermally unstable slim accretion disks were studied by honma et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , who find the disk to exhibit burst - like oscillations for the case of the standard @xmath16 viscosity description and for certain values of accretion rate .    using the estimate for the duration of the high - luminosity state ( honma et al . ;",
    "4.8 ) , and a duration of the outburst of less than 5 months ( the time difference between the first two observations of ngc5905 ) , a central black hole of mass in the range @xmath17 could account for the observations .",
    "the burst - like oscillations are found by honma et al . only for certain values of the initial accretion rate .",
    "a more detailed quantitative comparison with the observed outburst in ngc5905 is difficult , since the behavior of the disk is quite model dependent , and further detailed modeling would be needed .",
    "the idea of tidal disruption of stars by a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) was originally studied as a possibility to fuel agn ( hills 1975 ) , but was dismissed later .",
    "peterson & ferland ( 1986 ) suggested this mechanism as possible explanation for the transient brightening of the heii line observed in a seyfert galaxy .",
    "tidal disruption was invoked by eracleous et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in a model to explain the uv properties of liners , and was suggested as possible outburst mechanism for ic3599 ( brandt et al .",
    "1995 , grupe et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "rees ( 1988 , 1990 ) proposed to use individual such events as tracers of smbhs in nearby _ non - active _ galaxies .",
    "the debris of the disrupted star is accreted by the bh .",
    "this produces a flare , lasting of the order of months , with the peak luminosity in the opt - uv , euv or soft x - ray spectral region .",
    "the luminosity emitted if the bh is accreting at its eddington luminosity can be estimated by @xmath18 erg / s . in case of ngc5905 , a bh mass of at least @xmath19 m@xmath20 would be required to produce the observed @xmath21 , and a higher mass if @xmath21 was not observed at its peak value .",
    "the decline in luminosity after the maximum in the tidal disruption scenario scales as @xmath22 ( rees 1990 ) .",
    "the observed long - term x - ray lightcurve of ngc5905 is given in fig",
    "we favour the scenario of tidal disruption of a star because it can account for the high outburst luminosity , seems to require least fine - tuning , and the long - term x - ray lightcurve shows a continuous fading of the source over the whole measured time interval .",
    "however , we also caution that many theoretical details of the tidal disruption process are still rather unclear .",
    "we performed a search for further cases of strong x - ray variability ( komossa 1997 ) using the sample of nearby galaxies of ho et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and survey and archived pointed observations .",
    "we do not find another object with a factor @xmath0100 amplitude , but several sources are discovered to be strongly variable ( with maximal factors ranging between @xmath010 and 20 in the mean countrates ) : ngc3227 , ngc4051 , and ngc3516 .    it is a pleasure to thank the _ sternwarte sonneberg _ for the kind hospitality and g. richter additionally for valuable help in the assessment of the photographic plates .",
