    "the present paper is part of the local cosmology from isolated dwarfs ( lcid ) project .",
    "we have obtained deep _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) photometry , reaching the oldest main sequence turn - off points , of six isolated dwarf galaxies in the local group : ic  1613 , leo  a , cetus , tucana , , and phoenix .",
    "five galaxies were observed with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs , * ? ? ? * ) , while phoenix was observed with the wide field and planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the main goal of the lcid project is to derive the star formation histories ( sfhs ) , age - metallicity relations ( amrs ) , variable star populations , and stellar population gradients of this sample of galaxies .",
    "our objective is to study their evolution at early epochs and to probe effects of cosmological processes , such as the cosmic uv background subsequent to the onset of star formation in the universe or physical processes such as the gas removal by supernovae ( sne ) feedback .",
    "our sample consists of field dwarfs which were chosen in an effort to study systems as free as possible from environmental effects due to strong interactions with a host , massive galaxy .",
    "the sfh is a powerful tool to derive fundamental properties of dwarf galaxies and their evolution @xcite , but to study the earliest epochs of star formation , deep cmds , reaching the oldest main sequence turn - offs , are required ( cf .",
    "our impressions of the evolution of dwarf galaxies are biased by studies of the nearby , gas - poor dsph companions of the milky way .",
    "because of their proximity , deep cmds are obtainable from ground - based observatories .",
    "in contrast , the gas - rich , dirr galaxies , which are found at greater distances , have few studies with comparable photometric depth .",
    "the magellanic clouds represent the one exception to this generalization , but , because of",
    "they are substantially more massive than the typical dwarf galaxy and have potentially complex histories due to their current interactions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , they present less than ideal targets for study .    because of the larger distances to the dirrs , until the lcid project , none have had resolved star studies which reach down to the oldest main sequence turnoff stars .",
    "thus , our view of the sfhs of dwarf irregular galaxies has been shaped by relatively indirect measures .",
    "the work by @xcite represents a seminal contribution to our understanding of the sfhs of dirrs .",
    "based on galaxy mass estimates , blue luminosities , and h@xmath1 luminosities , they demonstrated that most irregular galaxies were consistent with nearly constant star formation over their lifetimes ( as opposed to the larger spiral galaxies which showed declining star formation rates , hereafter sfrs ) .",
    "most importantly , they pointed out that `` the constant sfr history implies that the simple classical model in which star formation is proportional to gas density in a closed system can not be correct for irregular galaxies . ''",
    "modern observations of nearby dirrs have been collected and summarized by @xcite , and indicate that , on average , sfrs are higher at early times , but that there are some dirrs for which constant sfrs are a good approximation .",
    "recently , there have been theoretical papers emphasizing the difficulty in making models of galaxies which have nearly constant sfrs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have all highlighted the difficulty of producing dwarf galaxies with properties comparable to those observed in the current universe .",
    "the degree of failure is greatest in the amount of mass converted into stars , which is of order one magnitude too large in cosmological simulations .",
    "this overproduction of stars in dwarfs is an extreme symptom of the `` over - cooling problem '' ( c.f .",
    "* ) faced by all galaxy modeling .    without deep imaging of resolved stars in dirr galaxies ,",
    "we lack sufficient time resolution to study sfhs at the earliest times .",
    "for example , the earliest time bin used by @xcite is 4 gyr in duration . at this time resolution",
    ", we can not distinguish between sfrs that are constant at all times , or sfrs that show considerable variation ( most importantly evidence for an early dominant episode of sf ) .",
    "the initial time bin of 4 gyr covers the time range from before re - ionization up to a redshift of @xmath22 ( which is approaching the peak of in the history of universal star formation , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and represents this entire important range with a single average number .",
    "the observations of ic  1613 presented here resolve this initial period and represent a small step into this relatively unexplored territory .      here",
    "we present our analysis of a deep hst / acs observation of a field in ic  1613 . as we discuss in section [ repfield ] ,",
    "the sfh that we derive for this field is likely a good representation for the entire galaxy .",
    "ic  1613 is a low - luminosity , local group , dirr galaxy which is one of the nearest gas - rich irregular galaxies ( for a review of the properties of ic  1613 see * ? ? ?",
    "because of its proximity , ic  1613 offers the opportunity to reconstruct a detailed sfh of a relatively isolated and non - interacting dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "ic  1613 also has very low foreground and internal reddening ( although it lies within 5 degrees of the ecliptic ) .",
    "there have been several determinations of its distance based on cepheid and rr  lyr variable stars and the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "using all three methods , @xcite derived a distance of 730 kpc . in a comparison of all of the literature values ( which included their own measurement using rr lyrae and cepheid data of 770 kpc ) , @xcite",
    "determine a mean distance of 760 kpc .",
    "the most recent determination is by @xcite who derived a distance of 740 kpc using cepheids . for consistency with the other lcid studies",
    ", we will adopt the distance estimate from @xcite which corresponds to scales of 221 pc arcminute@xmath3 , 3.7 pc arcsecond@xmath3 , and @xmath2 0.2 pc pixel@xmath3 .",
    "ic  1613 is not considered to be a satellite of either the milky way or m31 .",
    "@xcite included ic  1613 in the diffuse `` local group cloud , '' and @xcite determined a distance of 517 kpc and a velocity of @xmath490 km s@xmath3 relative to the local group barycenter .",
    "as such , it is located very close to the zero velocity surface for m  31 and well within the zero velocity surface for the local group @xcite . given its isolated position and velocity , ic  1613",
    "has not had any recent interactions , although interactions with other galaxies long ago can not be ruled out . to date , there are no proper motion studies of ic  1613 , which would be very valuable in determining its potential interaction history .",
    "the physical parameters of ic  1613 were summarized in @xcite .",
    "these properties are normal for an i m  v galaxy with a moderate luminosity ( @xmath515.2 ) and a small value of the maximum amplitude of the rotation curve ( v@xmath6 @xmath7 25 km s@xmath3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "its sfr of 0.003  @xmath8  yr@xmath3 @xcite is also normal for its type and luminosity .",
    "the most recent ism oxygen abundance measurement was made by @xcite , who obtained a spectrum where the @xmath94363 auroral line of [ ] was detected resulting in a measurement of 12 @xmath10 log ( o / h ) @xmath7 7.62 @xmath11 0.05 .",
    "this corresponds to 8.5% of the solar oxygen abundance ( as determined by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is slightly less than that of the smc , and normal for a galaxy of its luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "recently , @xcite have conducted a wide field optical survey of ic  1613 , and trace red giant branch ( rgb ) stars out to radii @xmath12 16.5 arcminutes ( @xmath2 3.6 kpc ) , showing the galaxy to be more extended than previously thought .",

    "horizontal branch ( hb ) stars were detected , indicating the presence of an old population .",
    "@xcite obtained deep imaging for a field located 7.4 arcminutes southwest of the center . while that imaging was not quite deep enough to reach to the oldest main sequence turnoff stars , greatly limiting the time resolution at the oldest ages , the derived sfrs were constant within a factor of three over the entire lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "in this paper , we present the sfh of ic  1613 obtained from observations with the acs on the hst .",

    "since there are no early isolated episodes of elevated sfr in the sfh , there is no obvious indication of the time resolution in the early sfh of ic  1613 shown in figure [ f2 ] .",

    "* for further details ) .",
    "since the observed field is close to the half - light radius , we make a type of `` mean value '' assumption and assume that the sfh derived from the observed field is a relatively good representation of the global sfh for ic  1613 . the balance between outer fields ( with relatively more older stars ) and inner fields ( with relatively more younger stars ) should not be too different from the sfh of a field at the half - light radius . for the rest of the paper",
    "the discussion will be based on this assumption and the sfh history of the observed field and the global sfh of ic  1613 will be used interchangeably .",
    "this assumption is supported by the comparison of hst observations of ic  1613 from different fields presented in  [ comp3 ] .",
    "note that our main result , the absence of a dominant star formation episode at early times , would only strengthen by the addition of more younger stars at smaller radii .",
    "the opposite possibility ( a relative surplus of older stars in the inner parts of the galaxy ) is constrained by the direct observation of the number of rgb stars in the central field from the earlier hst / wfpc2 observations ( * ? ? ? * see discussion in section  [ comp3 ] ) .",

    "thus , figure [ f8 ] does provide strong support for the assumption that the sfh derived from the acs observations can be assumed to be representative of the global sfh for ic  1613 .",
    "given the caveats from the previous paragraph we will refrain from any further discussion of this comparison .",
    "in this section , we will compare the sfh of ic  1613 with that of leo  a ( the other dirr galaxy of the lcid sample , * ? ? ? * ) , phoenix and ( the two dsph / dirr transition galaxies , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and with those of cetus and tucana ( the two dsphs , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . note that the lcid sample covers a range in dynamical masses . from @xcite the dynamical masses of ic  1613 ,",

    "note that @xcite highlighted the lack of early chemical enrichment in the transition galaxy lgs-3 and hypothesized that the differences between the transition galaxies and dsphs ( which show early chemical enrichment ) might be understood if the dsphs were initially more massive systems than the transition galaxies . under this hypothesis ,",
    "the delayed metal enrichment in the transition galaxies is due to higher losses of metals during times of higher sfrs for the lower mass transition galaxies . in this light , it is interesting that ic  1613 ( and also leo  a ) show delayed metal enrichment , but with no initial high sfr . in this regard , further comparisons of the sfh and amrs of transition galaxies and dirr galaxies would be be great interest .    ,",

    "only the statistical uncertainties are shown . in the lower panel , the systematic uncertainties are included following the methodology of @xcite . because all of the lcid galaxies have been observed to comparable depth , systematics in the models should have similar impacts to all of the galaxies .",
    "thus , it is likely appropriate to make comparisons using the upper panel .",
    "nonetheless , the lower panel shows the larger uncertainties encountered when trying to account for systematics and , even with the larger uncertainties , the six galaxies are shown to each have distinctive features in their sfhs .",
    "portraying the sfhs as cumulative stellar mass fractions ( as opposed to sfr as a function of time ) is the optimal way to compare observations to theoretical models for several reasons . variations in observed sfrs can be strongly affected by time binning and the changing time resolution as a function of lookback time . often , it is possible to have very different impressions of a single sfh simply by changing the time binning .",
    "it is possible to match the observational time binning by reducing the resolution in the models , but using the cumulative stellar mass fraction as the diagnostic avoids this problem altogether .",
    "it is also possible to compare galaxies at any arbitrary value of the cumulative stellar mass fraction , as opposed to choosing particular values to focus on . in the comparisons that follow",
    ", we will use the cumulative stellar mass fraction as the sole diagnostic .",
    "note that there is one obvious failing of the cumulative stellar mass fraction as the sole diagnostic , and that is the lack of information about the absolute masses of the systems .",
    "in the following comparisons , we will provide information about the masses of both the observed and modeled systems .",
    "recently , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have all highlighted the difficulty of producing dwarf galaxies in simulations with properties comparable to those observed in the current universe .",
    "together , the introductions to their papers give a comprehensive overview of the problems with modeling dwarf galaxy evolution .",
    "to summarize , there are two major problems .",
    "the first problem is the observed abundance of low - mass galaxies .",
    "the observed slope of the low - mass galaxy luminosity function is shallow relative to the slope of the halo mass function and this difference seems to be a result of an extreme inefficiency of galaxy - scale star formation over cosmic times .",
    "the well known problem of `` the missing satellites '' @xcite is one manifestation of this problem at very low luminosities / halo masses .",
    "the second problem relates to _ when _ stars are formed in galaxies .",
    "a natural assumption is that the time - scale for global star formation is related to the time - scale of baryonic accretion onto galaxies .",
    "however , low - mass halos assemble almost all of their ( dark matter ) mass at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while essentially all field dwarf galaxies show star formation continuing to the present day ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ic  1613 and leo  a are extreme examples of this , with essentially a constant sf rate across cosmic time for ic  1613 and delayed star formation in the case of leo  a.    in order to suppress the abundance of low - mass galaxies , most theoretical models impose strong feedback in small halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two processes can dramatically affect the formation and evolution of dwarf - sized halos : heating from the ultraviolet radiation arising from cosmic reionization and feedback from internal supernovae .",
    "both processes are , in principle , capable of completely halting the star formation in a dwarf halo and even fully removing all of the galaxy s gas . employing these feedback mechanisms",
    "while tying star formation to the collection of baryons has the effect of predicting that essentially all star formation in low - mass halos happens at early times .",
    "both semi - analytic models and hydrodynamical models fail to satisfactorily reproduce the evolution of low mass galaxies in the sense that stellar mass is over - produced per dark matter halo mass .",
    "stars are produced too quickly at early times , resulting in stellar mass fractions that are too high by an order of magnitude .",
    "model galaxies usually do not have the high gas mass fractions commonly observed in present day dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and , as a result , star formation falls off too fast and the colors of simulated dwarf galaxies are too red at @xmath43 @xmath7 0 .",
    "this is a manifestation of the `` over - cooling '' problem which is a challenge for all modeling efforts , but which is exaggerated at low masses .",
    "the missing satellites problem is largest at the lowest masses , and ic  1613 is massive enough that it could be expected to emerge from reionization with its gas intact .",
    "thus , ic  1613 does not provide as strong a test of models for this problem as the other , less massive , galaxies in the lcid sample .",
    "however , our deep hst observations have produced sfhs for ic  1613 and leo  a with small uncertainties even at earliest times and have completely ruled out the possibility of an early , dominant phase of star formation .",
    "_ this represents a real challenge for any model where star formation follows mass assembly .",
    "_       @xmath7 0 of @xmath2 10@xmath65 m@xmath66 , which is comparable to the estimated halo mass for ic  1613 .",
    "the difference in the early sfhs between the models and ic  1613 is very clear .",

    "their results are very useful for a direct comparison with observations .",
    "they identify and study six halos with present day dark matter halo masses of @xmath44 10@xmath65 m@xmath48 with stellar masses ranging between @xmath67 m@xmath48 and @xmath68 m@xmath48 . for comparison ,",
    "ic  1613 has an estimated stellar mass of @xmath2 10@xmath59 m@xmath48 @xcite , and the observed maximum rotation velocity of 25 km s@xmath3 @xcite . if we associate this peak rotation velocity with the maximum circular velocity of ic  1613 s host dark matter halo , this corresponds to a virial mass .",
    "] of @xmath69 .",
    "this is likely to be a lower limit , however , as the peak of the circular velocity curve for the dark matter halo may be attained at radii beyond the extent of the stellar or gaseous tracers .",
    "abundance matching models find that galaxies with stellar masses of @xmath70 should be hosted by halos with virial masses of @xmath71 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . given these estimates , the models of sawala et al .",
    "provide an excellent sample to compare to the derived sfh of ic  1613 .    as figure [ f11 ] demonstrates clearly , the early evolution of the model galaxies all depart significantly from that of ic  1613 .",
    "in essence , the models all have sfrs which depend directly on the gas content of the galaxies . as highlighted by @xcite , since , in the current paradigm , most of the mass of a low mass galaxy is in place well before @xmath43 @xmath7 1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , then any prescription in which star formation follows gas content is going to build up most of the stellar mass before @xmath43 @xmath7 1 .",
    "this discrepancy between models and observations , while demonstrated here for ic  1613 , is beginning to appear to be the norm .",
    "although the numbers are very limited , so far , all gas - rich dwarfs for which there exist sufficiently deep hst observations ( i.e. , leo a , leo t , smc : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show no evidence for a dominant early episode of star formation .",
    "there have been various attempts to improve models to better accommodate the inefficient star formation in dwarf galaxies . @xcite",
    "used sph + n - body simulations and showed that supernova feedback could disrupt enough gas to temporarily quench star formation .",
    "episodic star formation follows from the cycling of gas into a hot halo with subsequent cooling and infall .",
    "@xcite account for the prolonged star formation observed in dwarfs by adding a stochastic variation in the density threshold of the star formation law .",
    "essentially , this simply reduces the efficiency of star formation by hand , but the result is a significantly improved match to the observed sfhs of dwarfs .",
    "recently , @xcite have demonstrated that the thermal feedback from early star formation can effectively decouple star formation from mass assembly , thus producing more realistic sfhs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have proposed a different physical approach by investigating the conversion of atomic to molecular gas and its affect on the efficiency of star formation .",
    "this is well motivated by the observational work of @xcite and @xcite , which clearly demonstrate that star formation follows the molecular gas content and not the total gas content . in the specific case of dwarf galaxies , @xcite",
    "show that models which incorporate a star formation prescription regulated by the local abundance of molecular hydrogen lead to the less efficient star formation that is desired .",
    "unfortunately , their first attempts are not completely successful as they state , `` like most cosmological galaxy formation simulations to date , our simulated galaxies suffer from the so - called baryonic overcooling problem , resulting in unrealistically high central densities ( and hence strongly peaked circular velocity curves ) and stellar mass fractions in our high - mass halos that are too large compared to observations . ''",
    "however , this appears to be a very promising avenue for future exploration ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used a semi - analytic galaxy formation model to investigate the properties of the satellites of milky way - like galaxies and were able to match the star formation histories of several dwarf satellites .",
    "the extended sfhs of these satellites were a result of a gas density threshold for star formation .",
    "galaxies could have large reservoirs of gas lying just below the threshold , leading to inefficient star formation ( requiring a minor accretion or interaction event ) .",

    "they reproduce the observed stellar mass and cold gas content , the sfhs , and the metallicities typical of field dwarfs in the local volume . in figure",
    "[ f12 ] , we reproduce the cumulative stellar mass fraction for four of the model galaxies in @xcite .",
    "two of the galaxies ( `` bashful '' and `` doc '' ) have virial masses which are comparable to ic  1613 .",
    "these two models show nearly constant star formation with no dominant early episode of star formation , as observed in ic  1613 . in detail , the sfhs of these two models start later and rise faster during intermediate ages .",
    "the slower start of the models as compared to that of the measured sfhs may be attributed to differences in how time is defined in the two methods .",
    "that is , the simulations start at a fixed , given time , whereas the observationally derived ages come from stellar evolution libraries , and therefore depend on their underlying physics ( e.g. , nuclear reaction rates ) .",
    "the two lower mass galaxies ( `` dopey '' and `` grumpy '' ) show no early star formation at all , and only start forming stars at intermediate ages .",
    "these two models correspond to halo masses significantly less than that of ic  1613 , but might be more comparable to that of leo  a ( cf .",
    "figure [ f10 ] ) .",
    "note , however , that the stellar masses are even more discrepant .",
    "that is , dopey and grumpy have stellar masses of 10@xmath73 and 5 @xmath18 10@xmath73 m@xmath66 compared to 10@xmath59 and 6 @xmath18 10@xmath74 m@xmath66 for ic  1613 and leo  a.    naively , the late onset of star formation in the dopey and grumpy models would appear to be in contradiction to observations in which all dwarf galaxies observed to date show evidence for an old ( @xmath12 10 gyr ) population , particularly as evidenced by the presence of rr lyrae stars .",
    "for example , rr lyrae stars have been observed in leo  a @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite hypothesize that such systems may be the very metal poor systems necessary for the production of extremely metal deficient galaxies such as i  zw  18 ( see , e.g. , discussion and references in * ? ? ?",
    "one of the successes of recent modeling of dwarfs has been the ability of simulations to solve the cusp / core problem for dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dark matter halos of observed dwarf galaxies show nearly constant density cores , while steep central dark - matter profiles are expected from cdm models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the resolution to this conundrum lies in strong outflows from supernovae to remove low - angular - momentum gas from the centers of dwarf galaxies .",
    "this solves two problems as bulgeless dwarf galaxies are formed with shallow central dark - matter profiles , and a large fraction of the original baryons are lost from the galaxy , resulting in the lower baryon fractions ( relative to the universal fraction ) which are observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "what is not clear is whether the current ideas concerning how to produce inefficient star formation also lead to cored dark matter halos .",
    "clearly the strong outflows need to occur when the mass assembly is taking place , which is early on .",
    "if the vast majority of the star formation is delayed until later times , after the mass assembly is virtually finished , then the central outflow solution to the cusp / core problem may not arise self - consistently .",
    "a related point is the energetic requirements for creating bulgeless galaxies and forming cores in state - of - the - art hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "simulations that are currently successful require ( 1 ) highly efficient coupling between the energy released in a supernova explosion and the ism of a galaxy  values typically adopted are 0.41 @xcite and ( 2 ) an artificial prevention of gas cooling for approximately @xmath75 years in a region surrounding a supernova explosion , meant to capture processes that may occur at sub - grid scales and can not be directly included in the simulation @xcite .",
    "the success of simulations in producing bulgeless , cored dwarf galaxies with relatively low - level , extended star formation can be therefore seen as predictions for the effective coupling of supernova explosions with the ism and for the efficacy of additional feedback processes ( such as stellar winds ) at heating the ism on small scales .",
    "these predictions of very efficient coupling may be confirmed or refuted with future generations of simulations that model the relevant processes directly .    finally , although we have emphasized the difficulty of producing a nearly constant sfr as seen in ic  1613 , observations of dwarf galaxies in the local volume point toward a large diversity of sfhs .",
    "determining the critical parameters which drive that diversity is paramount .",
    "how can it be that dwarfs with halos of similar mass , which presumably have similar accretion histories and early formation times , have vastly different sfhs ?",
    "is environment and interaction history the main driver of the diversity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "clearly the sample of one presented here , and the very small number of comparably observed galaxies presents a great limitation to our knowledge of the evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
