    "the scattering experiments on deep inelastic electron - proton ( dis ) at hera have provided measurements of the inclusive structure function @xmath0 as well as of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 in very small bjorken variable @xmath3 values ( @xmath4 ) . in these collisions",
    "the proton target is analysed through a hard probe with virtuality @xmath5 .",
    "the momentum fraction is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the four - momenta of the incoming proton and of the virtual photon probe . in the kinematical region of small @xmath3",
    ", the gluon is the leading parton driving the behavior of the deep inelastic observables .",
    "the standard qcd evolution @xcite gives a powerlike growth for the gluon distribution and related quantities , and this feature leads , in principle , to the unitarity violation at asymptotic energies , requiring a control of the gluon distribution in high energies . in the partonic language , in the infinite momentum frame , the small momentum fraction region corresponds to the high parton density domain , which is connected with the black disk limit of the proton target and with the parton recombination phenomenon .",
    "these issues can be addressed through a non - linear dynamics beyond the usual dglap formalism ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the complete knowledge about the non - linear dynamical regime plays an important role in the theoretical description of the reactions in the forthcoming experiments rhic and lhc .    in the breit frame",
    ", the qcd factorization theorem allows to calculate the scattering processes through the convolution of the partonic subprocess with the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) .",
    "there , the degrees of freedom of the theory are the quasi - free partons ( quarks and gluons ) . on the other hand ,",
    "more recently the theoretical description of the small @xmath3 physics has been widely analyzed in the target rest frame , which is a powerful tool concerning an unified picture for both the inclusive and the diffractive scatterings , including vector meson production @xcite .",
    "now , the degrees of freedom are the color dipoles , which are the most simple configurations considering the virtual photon fock states expansion .",
    "its main appeal is a quite simplified picture for the different mentioned processes , based on general properties of quantum mechanics .",
    "the description of dis in the color dipole picture is quite intuitive , allowing a simple representation instead of the involved one from the breit ( infinite momentum ) frame , and such framework was proposed by gribov many years ago @xcite .",
    "considering small values of the bjorken variable @xmath3 , the virtual photon fluctuates into a @xmath9 pair ( dipole ) with fixed transverse separation @xmath10 at large distances upstream of the target and interacts in a short time with the proton .",
    "more complicated configurations should be considered for larger transverse size systems , for instance the photon fock state @xmath11 .",
    "an immediate consequence of the lifetime of the pair ( @xmath12 ) to be bigger than the interaction s one is the factorization between the photon wavefunction and the cross section dipole - proton in the @xmath13 total cross section .",
    "the wavefunctions are perturbatively calculable , namely through qed for the @xmath9 configuration @xcite and from qcd for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the effective dipole cross section should be modeled and encloses both perturbative and non - perturbative content .",
    "however , since the interaction strength relies only on the configuration of the interacting system the dipole cross section turns out to be universal and may be employed in a wide variety of small @xmath3 processes @xcite .",
    "currently , there are several models for the dipole cross section based either in pure phenomenological parametrizations or in a more theoretical ground ( for a review , see ref .",
    "the main feature in those models is the description of the energy dependence of the interaction , namely taking into account the interplay between hard and soft domains .",
    "the dipole cross section should be consistent with the sharp growth on energy at small transverse separation @xmath10 ( large gluon density ) and a softer behavior for larger @xmath10 ( regge - like phenomenology ) .",
    "an additional ingredient is the expectation for saturation effects in high energies as a consequence of the unitarity requirements .",
    "indeed , the growth of the gluon distribution should be tamed at very small @xmath3 and it has been found that the corrections are important already in the present hera kinematics @xcite . moreover , such effects are associated with higher twist contributions concerning the standard linear evolution equation , i.e. the dglap formalism @xcite .    here , we take into account a formalism providing the unitarity corrections to the deep inelastic scattering at small @xmath3 , namely the glauber - mueller approach in qcd .",
    "it was introduced by a. mueller @xcite , who developed the glauber formalism to study saturation effects in the quark and gluon distributions in the nucleus considering the heavy onium scattering .",
    "afterwards , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite extended that approach that has as a limit the glr results @xcite .",
    "it is obtained an evolution equation taking into account the unitarity corrections ( perturbative shadowing ) , generating a non - linear dynamics which is related with higher twist contributions .",
    "its main characteristic is to provide a theoretical framework for the saturation effects , relying on the multiscattering of the pqcd pomeron .",
    "the latter is represented through the usual gluonic ladder in the double logarithmic approximation .    summarizing the glauber - mueller approach , the gluonic content of the nucleus or nucleons",
    "is obtained in the following way : in the rest frame , a virtual probe ( gluon ) decays into a gluon pair interacting with the nucleon inside the nucleus .",
    "the multiple scatterings of the pair give rise to the unitarization of the corresponding cross section .",
    "the calculations are performed in the double logarithmic approximation ( dla ) , corresponding to the condition @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the qcd coupling constant and the gluon anomalous dimension , respectively . in this approximation ,",
    "the transverse separation of the pair remains fixed allowing an eikonal description for the interaction gluon pair - nucleon through incoherent multiscatterings @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the interaction can be expressed in terms of the nucleon gluon distribution @xmath18 and of the transverse separation @xmath10 of the gluon pair .",
    "the procedure for an initial state quark - antiquark pair is similar , up to proper color coefficients .",
    "such a formulation has produced comprehensive phenomenological applications : the inclusive structure function @xmath19 @xcite , the longitudinal @xmath1 and charmed @xmath2 ones @xcite , the logarithmic slope @xmath20 @xcite and other related quantities have been calculated in the breit system .",
    "the respective nuclear case has been investigated in refs . @xcite and",
    "the equivalence with other high density qcd approaches has been reported in refs .",
    "moreover , the asymptotic limit of the inclusive structure function and its logarithmic slope are estimated in @xcite . regarding the rest frame ,",
    "glauber - mueller has been also used to estimate the saturation effects for dis and diffractive dissociation @xcite as well as it is considered as initial condition for a high energy evolution equation ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the glauber - mueller approach gives a good framework for the unitarity effects ( saturation ) in the nucleon and nuclear sectors , providing the dynamics of the observables in a quantitative level .    in this work",
    "we make use of the parton saturation formalism to study the description of the observables driven by the gluonic content of the proton in the color dipole picture .",
    "the inclusive structure function @xmath19 is calculated properly , disregarding approximations commonly considered in previous calculations @xcite .",
    "the structure functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 are presented for the first time using the glauber - mueller approach and the rest frame in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "the saturation effects are included in the effective dipole cross section corresponding to the small size dipole contributions .",
    "the large dipole sizes are taken into account through an anstz for the non - perturbative region . here , we choose to freeze the gluon distribution at large distances @xcite .",
    "the dipole framework provides a clear identification in the transverse distance @xmath10 range where the perturbative and non - perturbative sectors ( soft domain ) contribute to the calculated quantities .",
    "large dipoles correspond to soft domain and the small ones are connected with the hard sector .",
    "as we will see , the photon wavefunctions play the role of a weight function selecting small dipole sizes , with a non - negligible contribution coming from the large dipole sizes .",
    "however , when considering the production of heavy quark pairs ( charm and bottom ) , their masses largely diminish the soft contribution .",
    "these issues are addressed throughout this paper .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the next section we shortly review the deep inelastic scattering in the rest frame , introducing the main formulae for the further analysis . in sec .",
    "( 3 ) one addresses the effective dipole cross section considering saturation effects ( unitarity corrections ) encoded in the glauber - mueller approach , pointing out its main properties and discussing the large transverse separation contribution .",
    "( 4 ) is devoted to calculate the theoretical estimates for the hera observables , focusing on those ones dominated by the gluon content . in the last section",
    "we draw our conclusions and comments .",
    "in the reference frame where the target ( proton ) has infinite momentum the usual description of the dynamics evolution is the following : the emitted partons from the target remain quasi - free for enough time in such a way that the virtual probe ( photon ) detects them as real particles ( asymptotic freedom ) . on the other hand , in the small @xmath3 region",
    "it is suitable to describe the evolution in a system where the target is at rest : in this situation the evolution is related to the partonic fluctuations of the probe and their interactions with the nucleon .",
    "the rest frame physical picture is advantageous since the lifetimes of the photon fluctuation and of the interaction process are well defined @xcite .",
    "the simplest case is the quark - antiquark state ( color dipole ) , which is the leading configuration for small transverse size systems .",
    "its life time can be estimated by the uncertainty principle through the energy fluctuation associated with the emerging pair . the well known coherence length is expressed as @xmath21 , where @xmath3 is the bjorken variable and @xmath22 the proton mass .",
    "for instance , in deep inelastic at hera kinematics reaching at @xmath23 , the coherence length is about @xmath24 fm , which is a distance larger than the radius of any atomic nuclei .",
    "an immediate consequence of such a picture is the factorization between virtual photon wavefunctions and the interaction cross section on the corresponding amplitude in the impact parameter space representation .",
    "a striking consequence of the formulation above is that the photoabsortion cross section can be derived from the expectation value of the interaction cross section for the multiparticle fock states of the virtual photon weighted by the light - cone wave functions of these states @xcite .",
    "the scattering matrix has an exact diagonalization in the @xmath25 fock states representation , where the partial - wave amplitudes subjected to the @xmath26-channel unitarization are identified properly .",
    "then , the photoabsortion cross section can be cast into the quantum mechanical factorized form , @xmath27    the formulation above is valid even beyond perturbation theory , since it is determined from the space - time structure of the process .",
    "the @xmath28 are the photon wavefunctions ( for transverse , @xmath29 , and longitudinal , @xmath30 , polarizations ) describing the pair configuration , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the fraction of the photon s light - cone momentum carried by the quark and antiquark of the pair , respectively .",
    "the transverse separation of the pair is @xmath33 .",
    "the precise normalizations of the wavefunctions can be determined through the fock expansion @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the @xmath36-wavefunction renormalization constant , @xmath37 denotes the bare state and @xmath38 is the coefficient determining the probability of the @xmath9 pair fluctuation in the photon @xcite . considering completely normalized states , then @xmath39 and the normalization for transverse photons",
    "is obtained from @xmath40 .",
    "the remaining normalizations , i.e. , longitudinal component and cross section , are consequently fixed @xcite .",
    "the explicit expressions are well known , @xmath41\\:\\varepsilon^2\\,k_1 ^ 2\\,(\\varepsilon\\ , r )   \\,+\\ , m_q^2\\ : k_0 ^ 2\\,(\\varepsilon\\ , r)\\,\\big\\ } \\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath42    clarifying the notation , the auxiliary variable @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the light quark mass , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the mc donald functions of rank zero and one , respectively .    the quantity @xmath47 is interpreted as the cross section of the scattering of the effective dipole with fixed transverse separation @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "it is directly dependent on the unintegrated gluon distribution , @xmath49    the unintegrated gluon distribution , @xmath50 , vanishes at the gluon transverse momentum @xmath51 ( and similarly for the factor @xmath52 ) due to gauge invariance , and therefore the dipole cross section has to be infrared finite .",
    "the most important feature of the dipole cross section is its universal character , namely it depends only on the transverse separation @xmath48 of the color dipole .",
    "the dependence on the external probe , i.e. the photon virtuality , is included in the wavefunctions .",
    "the main technical difficulty in eq . ( [ eq11 ] ) is to model the unintegrated gluon distribution function in a suitable way , mainly in the small transverse momentum ( @xmath53 ) region ( infrared sector ) . in particular , to obtain these distributions one should solve numerically an evolution equation , which makes the procedure cumbersome for practical use ( instead , for a prompt parametrization see @xcite ) . in general",
    ", this is avoided introducing an anstz for the effective dipole cross section and analyzing the process in the impact parameter space .",
    "the main feature of the current models in the literature is to interpolate the physical regions of small transverse separations ( qcd - parton improved model picture ) and the large ones ( regge - soft picture ) .",
    "below , we quote two of them , which have connections with the work performed here .",
    "the phenomenological saturation model of golec - biernat and wsthoff ( hereafter gbw ) gives a good description of dis data @xcite .",
    "the corresponding cross section interpolates between color transparency , i.e. @xmath54 at small @xmath10 , and constant cross section @xmath55 at large @xmath10 ( confinement ) .",
    "such a procedure ensures @xmath56-saturation , while parton saturation at low @xmath3 is obtained with an eikonal - inspired shape for the dipole cross section , @xmath57 where the parameters @xmath58 mb , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are fitted to the hera dis inclusive data with   @xmath61 , whereas @xmath62 gev@xmath63 sets the dimension .",
    "the @xmath3-dependent saturation radius @xmath64 scales the pair separation @xmath10 in the cross section and is associated with the mean separation between partons in the nucleon .",
    "this approach was used to describe diffractive dissociation in a parameter - free way , considering also the required @xmath14 configuration . some criticism to the gbw model , mainly concerning a better knowledge of the parton ( gluon ) distribution at low @xmath10 and its saturation at small @xmath3",
    "are postponed to the next section .",
    "the most of them can also to be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our work in this paper is closer to the mcdermott et al .",
    "one @xcite ( hereafter mcdfgs ) , where perturbative qcd relates the dipole cross section to the leading logarithmic gluon distribution function in the proton , at lla(@xmath56 ) accuracy , @xmath65 where the identification @xmath66 is allowed at leading - log level .",
    "a study of the dipole cross section is carried for all transverse separations @xmath10 in @xcite .",
    "the small @xmath10 region is described by the usual gluon pdfs , evoluting with the scale @xmath67 , while for large separations ( @xmath68 fm ) the dipole cross section is driven by the pion - proton contribution with the typical soft energy behavior from the hadronic sector . moreover",
    ", the taming of the parton density is implemented by hand starting at the named critical transverse separation @xmath69 , stated when the dipole cross section reaches one half of its maximum value labeled by the pion - proton cross section . in connection with the present work ,",
    "the glauber - mueller approach gives the eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) at the born level . instead of using an ad hoc control of the gluon distribution , the glauber - mueller provides corrections required by unitarity in an eikonal expansion . for the large @xmath10 region ,",
    "we choose to follow a similar procedure from the gbw model , namely saturating the dipole cross section ( @xmath10-independent constant value ) .",
    "having defined the notation and reviewed the main properties settled by the rest frame representation of deep inelastic process , in the next section we address the unitarity corrections formalism contained in the glauber - mueller approach , that we will consider in the calculation of @xmath19 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the glauber formalism concerns mainly interactions with a target nucleus , allowing to calculate the amount of unitarity corrections to the nuclear cross section .",
    "however this approach can be extended to take into account the evolution of the partonic densities ( saturation ) through the multiple scatterings .",
    "below , we review shortly the main properties of the glauber formalism in qcd , either in the nuclear case as its application to the nucleon case .",
    "we indicate the original papers @xcite for a complete presentation . it should be stressed that saturation effects mean unitarity corrections to the observables .",
    "indeed , the asymptotic calculations have produced an unified @xmath70 pattern for the cross section and gluon function instead of a effectively saturated one @xcite .",
    "since the small @xmath3 limit is driven by the gluonic interactions , we consider a virtual probe @xmath71 with invariant mass @xmath56 which decays into a gluon pair @xmath72 having a transverse separation @xmath48 and transverse momentum @xmath73 .",
    "then , the pair interacts with the target through a gluonic ladder at fixed transverse separation . following the discussion from the previous section , the photoabsortion cross section for the probe particle in terms of @xmath3 and virtuality @xmath56 in the nuclear case is @xmath74 where the variables have the same identification as in the @xmath9 pair discussion .",
    "the quantity @xmath75 is the light - cone wavefunction for the gluon pair .",
    "the glauber s multiscattering theory employs the phase shift method to describe processes at high energy for an incident particle undergoing into successive scatterings .",
    "when @xmath3 is small , the coherence length @xmath76 is bigger than the mean radius @xmath77 for all nuclei and the interaction of the initial parton stands through the entire nuclear path , providing coherent interactions with all target partons along the distance @xmath76 .",
    "these scatterings are coherent in an interaction of a hadronic fluctuaction , i.e. quark or gluon pairs , with the nucleus .",
    "there are interference effects among them , generating a reduction in the nuclear cross section , @xmath78 . otherwise , when @xmath79 , full incoherent scatterings occur leading to the expectation that the nuclear cross section equals to @xmath80 .",
    "the well known glauber formula for the total cross section of a hadronic state with the nucleus is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a profile function containing the dependence on the impact parameter @xmath83 , which is the conjugate variable to the momentum transfer @xmath84 .",
    "it is related to the nucleon distribution inside the nucleus and encodes the information about the angular distribution of the scattering .",
    "we discuss its particular shape later on .",
    "( [ glauber ] ) is quite general and allows to describe the hadronic fluctuations of the photon or any virtual probe , as saw in the last section .",

    "( [ sigeik ] ) and ( [ glauber2 ] ) , we identify the opacity @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , it has been found that the same formalism for multiple scatterings can be applied to the nucleon case . to proceed ,",
    "we should determine the @xmath72 cross section .",
    "the gluon pair cross section is equivalent to the quark pair one , up to a color factor ( @xmath97 ) .",

    "such a value differs from @xcite , where it is @xmath101 , which is obtained by an averaging procedure on the transverse size integral of @xmath1 .",
    "however , in further studies in vector mesons it was found that @xmath102 ranges from 4 - 15 , and @xmath19 and @xmath1 are not sensitive to those variations .",
    "thus , these values are consistent in leading logarithmic @xmath56 approximation .    from the above expression",
    ", one obtains a dipole cross section satisfying the unitarity constraint and a framework to study the unitarity effects ( saturation ) in the gluon dglap distribution function .",
    "hence , hereafter we use the glauber - mueller dipole cross section given by @xmath103    here , some comments are in order .",
    "the glauber - mueller approach is valid in the small @xmath3 region , and the gluon emission is described in the double logarithmic approximation of perturbative qcd .",
    "the interaction of the quark pair with the nucleon ( proton ) occurs through ladder diagrams exchange , satisfying the dglap equations in the dla limit .",
    "the high energy limit allows to treat successive scatterings as independent collisions , meaning the process described by the eikonal picture of a relativistic particle crossing the nucleus .",
    "moreover , as a consequence of no correlation among nucleons inside the nucleus ( in the nuclear case ) , there are no correlations among partons from different partonic cascades , stressing that only the fastest parton interacts with the target . the corrections coming from the slowest partons in the cascade ( emitted by the pair ) lead to the agl non - linear evolution equation @xcite , and they have been considered recently to describe diffractive dis in ref .",

    "such a value corresponds to significative unitarity corrections to the standard dglap input even in the current hera kinematics .",
    "now , we discuss in a detailed way the main characteristics emerging from the dipole cross section eq .",

    "( [ dipolgm ] ) , whereas the dashed lines are the gbw model @xcite presented for comparison .",
    "the general shape in terms of the dipole size comes from the balancing between the color transparency @xmath112 behavior and the gluon distribution .    here",
    "some comments about the large transverse separation are in order : although perturbative qcd provides reliable results at small distances ( small dipole sizes ) , the nonperturbative sector is not still completely understood .",
    "the usual pdf s are evoluted from a perturbative initial scale @xmath113 gev@xmath63 , and one has little information about the behavior at @xmath114 . in general",
    "one makes use of regge phenomenology to estimate those contributions ( see , for instance @xcite ) .",
    "thus , extrapolating to lower virtuality regions ( large dipole sizes ) one needs a parametrization regarding the nonperturbative sector .",
    "this is the main justification of the use the grv94 parametrization @xcite in our calculations . bearing in mind that @xmath115 , its evolution initial scale is @xmath116 gev@xmath63 allowing to scan dipole sizes up to @xmath117 gev@xmath118 (= 0.62 fm ) .",
    "for the most recent parametrizations , where @xmath119 gev@xmath63 ( @xmath120 fm ) the amount of nonperturbative contribution in the calculations should increase .",
    "an additional advantage is that grv94 does not include non - linear effects to the dglap evolution since the parametrization was obtained from rather large @xmath3 values .",
    "this feature ensures that the parametrization does not include unitarity corrections ( perturbative shadowing effects ) in the initial scale .",

    "a more phenomenological way is to match the pqcd dipole cross section with the typical hadronic one @xmath121 at @xmath122 as performed in @xcite .",

    ", gbw has some details that deserve some discussions : the approach does not present a dynamical hypothesis for the saturation phenomena and does not match dglap evolution . in gbw",
    ", saturation is characterized by the @xmath3-dependent saturation radius @xmath138 instead of the scale coming from glauber - mueller , @xmath139 , which can be easily extended for the nuclear case @xcite .    in fig .",
    "( [ dipsigmas ] ) one shows the glauber - mueller dipole cross section and the gbw model @xcite .",

    "therefore , a reasonable description of this quantity suggests that the glauber - mueller formalism ( or similar eikonal - like approaches ) take into account the most important contributions to the complete higher - twist corrections at current kinematical regimes .",

    "@xcite have calculated numerically the twist - four correction obtaining that they are large for @xmath205 and @xmath1 , although with opposite signs .",
    "this fact leads to remaining small effects to the inclusive structure function by almost complete cancellation between those contributions .",

    "it contributes less than 10% at low @xmath56 and reaches to about 30 % for @xmath219 gev@xmath63 @xcite .",
    "once more the color dipole picture will provide a quite simple description for the charm structure function in a factorized way .",

    "there is a slight sensitivity to the value of the charm mass , increasing the overall normalization as @xmath220 diminishes .",
    "such a feature suggests that the charm mass is a hard scale suppressing the non - perturbative contribution to the corresponding cross section , which is in agreement with the recent bfkl color dipole calculations of nikolaev - zoller @xcite and donnachie - dosch @xcite .    regarding the breit system description , in ref .",

    "the resulting calculations corroborate a quite consistent picture for the unitarity corrections from the glauber - mueller approach in both breit and rest reference systems . in the laboratory frame",
    "the unitarity effects are connected with the gluon distribution function , whereas in the color dipole framework the basic block is the dipole cross section which is corrected considering saturation effects .",
    "the small transverse separation @xmath10 region is dominated by the leading log dglap formalism , with the additional ingredient of unitarization phenomenon as the momentum fraction acquires quite small values .",
    "such corrections are associated with the taming of the gluon distribution in the very small @xmath3 region , in general named saturation regime .",

    "that the bgk model matches dglap evolution , glauber - mueller describes more properly the realistic impact parameter dependence of the process .",

    "however , a non - negligible content from the soft sector is present .",
    "moreover , the photon wavefunctions enhances the dipole cross section into smaller dipole sizes , since the weight function selects smaller @xmath10 as the virtuality @xmath56 diminishes .",
    "our estimates here are parameter - free , however a fine tunning of the parameters can improve the data description .",

    "a remarkable feature is that the glauber - mueller approach in the color dipole framework gives important higher twist contributions to the leading twist calculation in a simple way .",

    "the glauber - mueller approach provides a well stablished formalism to take into account the unitarity effects .",
