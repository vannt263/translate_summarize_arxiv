    "a system is called extended if it consists of many individual similar subsystems distributed in space , and all the subsystems have the same dynamics . examples of extended systems are obtained by assembling similar subsystems through diffusive coupling",
    ". if all the local subsystems are in the same state , that is , synchronized , the extended system behaves globally as the local subsystem .",
    "however , if one of the subsystems is desynchronized , we can have the emergence of collective behavior , and the dynamic behavior of the extended system is dependent on both the initial spatial distribution of the desynchronized subsystems and the parameters of the local system .    here",
    "we are interested in the emergence of collective behavior of an extended system when the initial conditions of a local subsystem are changed .",
    "when the local dynamics has a stable steady state in the phase space and is close to a homoclinic orbit , we show that , in the extended system , wave trains , propagating solitary pulses and propagating pulse packets can develop .",
    "these types of wave patterns depend on the distribution of the initial states of the extended system .",
    "an extended system is excitable if after being slightly locally perturbed from a stable steady state it returns to the quiescent state , but shows traveling activity waves if perturbations are large enough .",
    "systems responding in this way to perturbations are said to have a threshold .",
    "systems with excitable behavior appear in extended chemical reactions @xcite , in the propagation of action potentials along nerve axons @xcite , and in population dynamics models @xcite .    in the context of extended chemical reactions , there are two main types of models showing excitability .",
    "one of these models , the nullcline model , has been proposed by tyson and fife @xcite and tyson and keener @xcite to explain excitability effects in chemical experiments . in this model ,",
    "excitability is related to the particular behavior of the nullclines in the two - dimensional phase space of a differential equation : one nullcline is n - shaped , the other is monotonic and they intersect at only one point .",
    "excitability develops as a continuous process when initial conditions are changed across the n - shaped nullcline , leading to an abrupt continuous change of the orbit length in phase space . in this case",
    ", the system does not have a precise threshold , but a finite narrow threshold region .",
    "these models of excitable systems have only one stable fixed point and are usually associated with two - variable models , with a slow and a fast dynamics @xcite . in the literature of excitable systems",
    "they are called type i excitability models .",
    "another model for excitable behavior has been proposed by noszticzius , wittmann and stirling @xcite , mccormic , noszticzius and swinney @xcite in the context of the observed behavior in belousov - zhabotinskii type chemical systems , and by ermentrout and rinzel @xcite in the context of propagation of action potentials along nerve axons .",
    "this model gives a qualitative explanation for the appearance of an excitable steady state in chemical experiments and in the propagation of action potentials along nerve axons through a bifurcation in the local kinetics , from a limit cycle to a saddle - node pair of fixed points .",
    "some authors called it saddle - node infinite period or sniper model @xcite , or type ii excitability model .",
    "this qualitative model has three fixed points in phase space , one saddle point , one stable node and one unstable focus . in this case",
    ", the phase portrait has a sharp threshold of excitability associated with the stable manifold of the saddle point .",
    "the threshold of excitability has two branches , one connecting a saddle point with the unstable focus , and the other starting at the saddle point and going to infinity .",
    "several reaction - diffusion models with these features appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "these excitability models can produce propagating pulses in extended media as observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "the sniper or saddle - node homoclinic ( snh ) bifurcation has been predicted by leontovich @xcite and andronov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , as a topological possibility for the break of hyperbolicity of limit cycles in two - dimensional continuous dynamical systems , and is one of the simplest codimension-1 semilocal bifurcations @xcite .",
    "as the snh bifurcation is nonlocal , local analysis describes the local saddle - node bifurcation , missing the appearance of the limit cycle @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to build a sufficiently general explicit analytical model for this global bifurcation .    for several chemical systems in stirred tank reactor experiments , maselko and",
    "epstein @xcite have constructed qualitative experimental phase portraits compatible with the experimental behavior and a saddle loop bifurcation scenario . in this approach ,",
    "the qualitative phase portraits have one stable and two unstable fixed points , but are obtained through a saddle loop codimension-2 ( bogdanov - takens ) bifurcation of a fixed point @xcite . to have bounded motion in phase space , we must have an additional stable node external to the saddle loop .",
    "however , the phase portraits of these systems are topologically equivalent to those obtained through the saddle - node homoclinic ( snh ) bifurcation .",
    "hence , an excitability model with threshold can be obtained by two different bifurcation scenarios , but at the excitable regime , they have the same phase space structure . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the simplest bifurcation scenario through the codimension-1 snh bifurcation .",
    "our aim here is to derive a sufficiently general excitability model compatible with the above mentioned experimental results .",
    "we begin by constructing an explicit model that exhibits a hopf and a saddle - node homoclinic bifurcation , both driven by independent parameters .",
    "then , we add diffusion to the two phase space coordinates , obtaining a general model of a reaction - diffusion excitable media . with a bench - marked numerical method , we derive properties of the solutions of the one- and the two - dimensional reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "the hopf bifurcation will be essentially associated with the existence of stable oscillations of the local kinetics , as observed in continuous stirred tank reactor experiments @xcite .",
    "the saddle - node homoclinic bifurcation will be associated with the break up of the periodic behavior of the local kinetics and the appearance of a new steady state with the excitability property @xcite .",
    "we show that , at and beyond the snh bifurcation , an extended chemical system coupled by diffusion develops traveling wave trains , propagating pulses , pulse packets and fronts , and aperiodic wave trains or turbulent states .",
    "periodic wave trains , pulses and pulse packets are tuned by different initial conditions .",
    "turbulent states and fronts are obtained by changing the parameters of the local model .",
    "all these situations occur for equal diffusion coefficients in the two phase space variables .    in the next section ,",
    "we derive the main properties of locally excitable two - dimensional models associated with the snh bifurcation , we derive its geometric features in phase space , and we characterize its bifurcation set . in section 3 , the diffusion coupling is introduced , and the properties of the solutions of the associated one- and two - dimensional reaction - diffusion system are analyzed by numerical methods . as we are dealing with a parabolic partial differential equation , we emphasize our analysis on the pattern formation features associated with the initial conditions of the extended system .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "in order to construct an analytical model exhibiting a hopf and a snh bifurcation , the starting point will be the versal unfolding of the hopf bifurcation in polar coordinates , @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are real parameters . in the literature of chemical kinetics , equation ( [ e:1 ] ) is the stuart - landau equation with real parameters @xcite .    if , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , equation ( [ e:1 ] ) has one limit cycle ( in cartesian coordinates ) in phase space and an unstable focus at the origin .",

    "if @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we are in the conditions of a ( bogdanov - takens ) codimension-2 bifurcation @xcite . in this case , ( [ e:1 ] ) is no longer a versal unfolding for this bifurcation .",
    "one of the features of the normal form ( [ e:1 ] ) is that the phase equation is phase independent . from the analysis of the vector field ( [ e:1 ] ) , for @xmath5 , and @xmath14 , in cartesian coordinates , the rotation frequency of orbits in phase space near the origin approaches @xmath4 . on the limit cycle",

    "for , @xmath5 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , the rotation frequency on the limit cycle becomes zero , all the points on the limit cycle are fixed points , and the phase space trajectories on the limit cycle do not rotate . under this condition ( @xmath20 )",
    ", we have a line of fixed points . due to this property of the normal form ( [ e:1 ] ) ,",
    "if we make the parameter @xmath2 phase dependent , we can incorporate a saddle - node bifurcation into the limit cycle , obtaining a non - local , snh , bifurcation for the full dynamics .",
