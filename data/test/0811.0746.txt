    "over the last eight years , the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) has been providing heavy ion collisions in the attempt to create the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) within the laboratory .",
    "some of the most striking data from the first few years at rhic were results from the apparent interaction of hard scattered partons in the medium produced at rhic .",
    "single high-@xmath4 particles are suppressed relative to binary collision - scaled @xmath5 rates@xcite ; di - jets , measured from pairs of high-@xmath4 hadrons , are suppressed relative to @xmath5 and have a strongly modified angular correlation@xcite ; and heavy quarks , both charm and bottom , are suppressed as well@xcite .",
    "these data have been interpreted as the loss of energy of a colored parton traversing a colored medium , analogous to energy loss in qed .",
    "however , many of the details underlying qcd energy loss are not well understood .",
    "on the one hand , energy loss models are able to reproduce the single particle suppression with very different assumptions on the rate of energy loss@xcite . on the other",
    ", multiple high-@xmath4 particle correlations may suffer from a bias for the jet to lose little if any energy@xcite .",
    "this is observed in data where the measured jet properties are quite similar between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and they have only slightly more constraining power on models .    to overcome such biases , it is necessary to move beyond multi - particle correlations and measure jets directly in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this note highlights the current status of jet reconstruction and energy loss measurements expected to be made with the atlas detector at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the large acceptance and nearly hermetic electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters were designed for jet measurements and are uniquely suited to perform these measurements in heavy ion collisions .",
    "such measurments will result in an increased understanding of how colored partons lose energy in a colored environment , a direct test of qcd .",
    "unlike @xmath7 annihilation or @xmath8 collisions , heavy ion collisions result in a large , soft , underlying event .",
    "the charge particle multiplicity in central ( head - on ) @xmath9 collisions is expected to be between dn / d@xmath10=1500 - 3000 . to put this in perspective ,",
    "an average of 70 - 150 gev would exist in an r = @xmath11 = 0.4 radius cone from the underlying event alone .",
    "therefore , jet clustering algorithms must be modified to handle such large backgrounds .",
    "such a modification is not unlike the pile - up event subtraction@xcite necessary at full lhc luminosity .",
    "both a seeded cone algorithm and the @xmath12 algorithm have been explored for use in heavy ion collisions within atlas@xcite . for the rest of this note",
    "we will focus on seeded cone jet results .",
    "the underlying event energy is removed by the following steps .",
    "first , regions of high energy in the calorimeter are identified as possible regions with a jet .",
    "next , the average @xmath13 from the cells are calculated as a function of @xmath10 and for each longitudinal calorimeter segment , excluding the regions in the first step .",
    "this average is then subtracted from _ all _ calorimeter cells .",
    "finally , 0.1@xmath140.1 towers in @xmath15 built from a sum of subtracted cells are used as input to an r=0.4 cone algorithm with a tower threshold of @xmath16 5 gev .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] shows the comparison of the input , reconstructed , maximal , and final fake rate.several spectra .",
    "the input and reconstructed distributions are from di - jet pythia events embedded in unquenched hijing with dn / d@xmath10=2700 .",
    "the raw reconstructed spectrum is not corrected for efficiency and @xmath0 resolutions .",
    "the raw fake spectrum is evaluated by running the jet algorithm with background subtraction directly on unquenched hijing with a requirement that no jets with @xmath1710 gev are produced .",
    "the final fake rate is determined after a cut on the shape of the energy distribution within the jet has been made .",
    "such a cut is also applied to the raw spectrum . for 70 gev jets ,",
    "the efficiency is 70% , the energy resolution is 25% , and the fake fraction is 3% .",
    "once jets can be reliably measured , their modification due to interactions with the medium will be explored . in this section",
    "we discuss modification of single jet rates@xcite and the increased acoplanarity of di - jets because of the incoherent multiple scattering in the medium@xcite .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] shows the ratio of raw reconstructed to input spectra .",
    "since the raw spectrum is uncorrected for efficiency and @xmath0 resolution , this represents a worst case scenario in the measurement of the jet @xmath2 defined as @xmath18 such a variable will be sensitive to details of energy loss .",
    "for example , if jets were perfectly reconstructed , @xmath2=1 .",
    "however , because collisional energy loss will impart energy to the medium , all lost energy will not be recovered and @xmath191 .",
    "further , energy loss due to radiation outside of the cone size or the jet area will cause @xmath19 1 of jets . a non - perturbative energy loss scenario based on ads / cft arguments would result in an @xmath201@xcite .",
    "therefore , studying the jet @xmath2 as a function of cone size , seed @xmath0 , etc . should be sensitive to the details of jet energy loss@xcite .",
    "[ fig : jetcorr ] shows two examples of jet azimuthal decorrelations to be measured in atlas .",
    "the left panel shows the reconstructed di - jet and the right panel shows the reconstructed @xmath3-jet @xmath21 distributions . in a @xmath22 process ,",
    "the produced hard scattering products are directly back - to - back , _",
    "i.e. _ at @xmath23 . intial and final state radition results in a natural broadening to this distributions . further , radiation from in - medium energy loss will also broaden this distribution@xcite .",
    "however , this broadening has not been measured at rhic@xcite .",
    "this could indicate that the broadening is small or it is a consequence of the bias to little energy loss of the two - particle correlation measurements .",
    "atlas expects to perform ground breaking measurements in qcd energy loss studies using fully reconstructed jets .",
    "this note highlighted the current status of cone jet reconstruction and measurements of jet rates and jet correlations as sensitive tests of qcd energy loss .",
