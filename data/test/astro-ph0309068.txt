    "the successful installation of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on - board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and the promise of new observatories like the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) , have opened new opportunities for multiwavelength surveys of the distant universe . however , most of the galaxies detected in these surveys are too faint for spectroscopic observations .",
    "the photometric redshift technique is the only practical way to estimate distances to these galaxies , needed for statistical studies of their properties .",
    "the technique has the advantage of providing redshifts for large samples of faint galaxies with a relatively modest investment of observing time , but has the disadvantage of having coarse wavelength resolution ( @xmath5 1000  ) compared to a much higher resolution obtained spectroscopically ( @xmath6  ) .",
    "the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) is designed to reach unprecedented depths in two fields , the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) and hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) , using hst , chandra , and sirtf .",
    "the majority of the objects detected in goods are fainter than the practical limit for spectroscopy .",
    "accurate photometric redshifts are therefore essential , in order to estimate distances to galaxies hosting type ia supernovae , to convert observable properties ( size , color , magnitude ) to those in the rest - frame , and to explore many other aspects of galaxy evolution .",
    "this _ letter _ provides details of the procedure used to estimate redshifts to galaxies in the goods cdf  s , and to assess the accuracy with which these are measured , using a sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we also test the accuracy of photometric redshifts for special subsamples of objects that have particular scientific interest within the goods data set : extremely red objects ( eros ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "we limit our present analysis to the goods cdf - s field , where the most complete , multiwavelength photometric data are currently available .",
    "the imaging data and photometric catalogs are described in giavalisco et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . here , we have used ground - based optical ( @xmath7 ) and near - infrared ( @xmath8 ) data from eso facilities ( 2.2m - wfi , vlt - fors1 , ntt - sofi , vlt - isaac ) , as well as from hst / acs ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "most of the imaging data cover the whole goods field of view , but a few ( isaac @xmath10 , and fors1 @xmath11 ) do not . in total",
    ", there are as many as 18 independent photometric measurements for each galaxy .",
    "we matched the point spread functions ( psfs ) of the images , including the acs data , as described in giavalisco et al .",
    "an @xmath12-band selected catalog was created with sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "the photometry used for the photometric redshifts was measured through matched , 3 arcsec diameter apertures in all bands .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of cdf - s galaxies are from two separate samples :    * k20 : * a portion of this @xmath13selected survey ( @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ; cimatti et al 2002a , 2002b ) lies within the cdf - s , and has reliable spectroscopic redshifts for 271 objects , with a median redshift @xmath16 . using their spectra , the galaxies were classified as normal ( i.e. , emission and absorption line systems ) or agns .",
    "* goods / fors2 : * the goods team is carrying out an extensive spectroscopic campaign in the cdf - s as an eso large programme ( c.  cesarsky , pi ) . here , we use data from the first observing season , obtained with the vlt - fors2 spectrograph using the 300i grism ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the primary targets were faint ( @xmath18 ) , red ( @xmath19 ) galaxies selected from the acs imaging .",
    "a heterogeneous sample of other galaxies was used to fill out the multislit masks .",
    "we use 163 redshifts that were measured with good confidence , with a median redshift @xmath20 .",
    "we matched the spectroscopic and photometric catalogs , and used the multicolor data to estimate photometric redshifts for galaxies in the spectroscopic sample .",
    "the comparison between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts then gives an estimate of the photometric redshift accuracy .",
    "because the two spectroscopic samples are selected differently , we have analyzed them separately and compare the results to explore any biases induced by color / magnitude selection criteria .",
    "we have performed extensive experiments with two variant methods of photometric redshift estimation : spectral template @xmath21 minimization ( puschell et al . 1982 ) , and the bayesian method of bentez ( 2000 ) . in the @xmath21 technique ,",
    "the photometric redshift of a galaxy is estimated by comparing its multi - band photometry with spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates of galaxies with known types , shifted in redshift space , and integrated through the bandpass throughput functions .",
    "for each template , at each redshift , the @xmath21 statistic is estimated , with the best  fitting redshift and spectral type found from the minimum @xmath21 value assigned to the galaxy .",
    "the bayesian approach considers the distribution @xmath22 , i.e. the redshift probability given not only the observed colors of a galaxy , @xmath23 , but also its magnitude , @xmath24 .",
    "this can be written as ( bentez 2000 ) : @xmath25    the first term on the right is the redshift / magnitude prior , which contains the probability of a galaxy having redshift @xmath26 and spectral type @xmath27 , given its magnitude @xmath24 , while the second term is the redshift / type likelihood , @xmath28 .",
    "note that using a prior of this kind is not equivalent to assuming a particular luminosity function ; the prior describes the expected redshift distribution for galaxies of a certain magnitude , but does not include information about the galaxy magnitude distribution .",
    "the shape of the prior is estimated empirically from the hdf - n observations , as described in bentez ( 2000 ) .",
    "the best estimate of the redshift , @xmath29 , is then defined as the maximum of @xmath22 .",
    "we compared results from several different software implementations of the @xmath21 method , as well as different choices of the sed templates ( empirical or synthetic ) , and found them to be in generally good agreement with one another and with the bayesian photometric redshift ( bpz ) results up to @xmath30 . however , at higher redshifts , the bpz approach gives significantly better performance , as described in  4 , below .",
    "we have used the bpz softwaretxitxo/ , bentez 2000 ] which offers both simple @xmath21 minimization , as well as the bayesian estimate .",
    "we use template libraries , consisting of e , sbc , scd and i m seds from coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ) and two starburst sb2 and sb3 templates from kinney et al .",
    "a two point interpolation between each pair of templates in the color ",
    "redshift space is performed , significantly improving the redshift resolution .",
    "the bpz uses a quality indicator , the bayesian odds , which can be efficiently used to discard those objects with unreliable photo - z s .",
    "the odds is defined as the integral of the probability distribution @xmath22 within a @xmath31 interval centered on @xmath29 .",
    "the odds would thus be 0.95 for a gaussian @xmath32 with width @xmath33 , which is the empirically measured accuracy of bpz in the hdf - n .",
    "we quantify the reliability of the photometric redshifts by measuring the fractional error for each galaxy , @xmath34 . we examine the median error , @xmath35 , the _ rms _ scatter @xmath36 , and the rate of `` catastrophic '' outliers , @xmath37 , defined as the fraction of the full sample that has @xmath38 .",
    "table 1 presents the comparison between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for both the k20 and fors2 samples , using the complete photometric data set available for each object , and for different combinations of magnitude limits and the odds parameter .",
    "overall , the bpz method yields @xmath39 and 0.07 for the fors2 and k20 samples , respectively . at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath40 ) ,",
    "the bpz method gives smaller _ rms _ scatter than the conventional @xmath21 minimization technique with no priors .",
    "the bpz results are presented in figure 1 .",
    "the agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is excellent , with median offset @xmath41 .",
    "there is no substantial trend in @xmath35 with redshift , except perhaps for a slight tendency for the photometric redshifts to be underestimated at @xmath42 .",
    "the _ rms _ values are all based on a total of 433 galaxies in k20 ( 270 ) and fors2 ( 163 ) , with the object at @xmath43 excluded ( see 4.2b ) .    for redshifts estimated with bayesian priors ,",
    "we find that the fraction of catastrophic outliers , @xmath37 , ranges from 0.024 to 0.10 , depending on the subsample considered . as described in bentez ( 2000 ) , the value of the odds parameter is a reasonable indicator of the reliability of the photometric redshift , galaxies with larger odds values have a smaller rate of outliers .",
    "we have measured @xmath44 using only galaxies with @xmath45 ( i.e. , excluding the outliers ) , and find 0.049 ( fors2 ) and 0.046 ( k20 ) from the bpz method .",
    "the outlier  clipped _",
    "rms _ is similar when using the conventional @xmath21 method without priors , but the failure rate , @xmath37 , from this method is much larger .",
    "we have estimated redshifts using different combinations of the available photometric data in cdf - s , and find no significant differences in the @xmath44 values . in particular , we have compared the performance with and without using the acs photometry , and found no significant difference in the overall result .",
    "the deep acs photometry , however , may well be important at fainter magnitudes , beyond the limits of the spectroscopic sample .",
    "18% of the fors2 galaxies , and 13% of the k20 galaxies , are undetected ( @xmath46 ) in the relatively shallow wfi @xmath47 or @xmath48 images .",
    "however , we find no significant difference in @xmath49 values for galaxies with and without @xmath50 detections down to the spectroscopic magnitude limit ( crosses in figure 1 )",
    ". we have also estimated photometric redshifts using the wfi and sofi data alone , which cover a wider cdf  s area , including areas not imaged by acs .",
    "we measure @xmath51 ( for @xmath52 ) .",
    "figure 2 plots the redshift errors @xmath49 versus galaxy magnitudes in the @xmath12 and @xmath53 bands .",
    "there is no strong trend in @xmath36 with magnitude , except at the faintest @xmath53band limits , @xmath54 .",
    "the outlier fraction @xmath37 increases from 0.03 ( @xmath55 ) to 0.05 ( @xmath56 ) to 0.11 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the photometric redshifts are also , on average , slightly underestimated for @xmath58 . at these faint magnitudes ,",
    "many of the galaxies are only poorly detected , if at all , in the wide  field ( but relatively shallow ) sofi @xmath8 images , causing an increase in redshift errors .",
    "results from table 1 indicate that the photometric redshift performance is correlated with the odds parameter , and is better for higher odds values ( odds @xmath59 0.99 ) .",
    "it is important to remember that the galaxies in the spectroscopic sample are relatively bright compared to the large majority of objects in the goods fields .",
    "the odds parameter , perhaps combined with other indicators , ( e.g. , the number of passbands in which the galaxy is significantly detected ; availability of @xmath47-band and near - ir data ; the width of the redshift probability distribution ) , offers a useful metric for the likely reliability of photometric redshifts at magnitudes fainter than the limit of our spectroscopic test sample .",

    "a ) . eros* the goods ero sample is selected to have @xmath60 and is complete to @xmath61 mag .",
    "a total of 66 eros have spectroscopic redshifts in the combined fors2 ( 36 ) and k20 ( 30 ) samples .",
    "figure 3a compares the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for eros .",
    "there is an excellent agreement , with @xmath62 , and is equally good for objects classified as absorption and emission line systems .",
    "furthermore , we find a very small fraction of outliers ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this performance is significantly _",
    "better _ than that for the galaxy sample as a whole",
    ". this may not be surprising : in general , red galaxies have stronger features in their broad band spectral energy distributions ( breaks , curvature ) than do blue ones . however , it is a very helpful result , because eros are among the most difficult galaxies for spectroscopic observations .",
    "the ero population is known to consist of high redshift ( @xmath64 ) ellipticals and dusty starbursts ( cimatti et al 2002c ) .",
    "however , the starburst galaxy templates from kinney et al ( 1996 ) that are used for photometric redshift estimation are not significantly reddened , and certainly do not match the colors of eros .",
    "photometric redshifts for the majority of the eros , therefore , are derived from the elliptical galaxy spectral template , regardless of the true nature of the galaxies .",
    "moustakas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find that @xmath65 of the goods eros are morphologically early  type galaxies ; the rest are either disk galaxies or irregular systems .",
    "however , they also find that the broad band seds of the eros in different morphological subclasses are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "thus , we expect comparably good photometric redshift estimates for most eros , regardless of their intrinsic nature .",
    "agns* 48 galaxies in the spectroscopic k20 ( 31 ) and fors2 ( 17 ) samples have x - ray detection ( alexander et al 2003 ) .",
    "figure 3b compares photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for these x - ray sources .",
    "the _ rms _ scatter , excluding the object at @xmath43 , which is confirmed to be a qso , is @xmath66 , with an oulier fraction of @xmath67 .",
    "excluding the five outliers reduces the _ rms _ scatter to @xmath68 .",
    "the majority of the x - ray sources at higher redshifts here are agns although some are likely to be x - ray starbursts .",
    "six of these sources are spectroscopically confirmed as agns ( crosses in figure 3b ) . the scatter and",
    "the outlier fraction for the x - ray sources ( i.e. agns ) , is similar to that for normal galaxies in figure 1 .",
    "we tried using an independent set of observed agn seds as templates , but did not significantly improve @xmath36 .",
    "using the conventional @xmath21 method without priors increases @xmath44 value to 0.43 .",
    "combining multi - waveband ground - based and acs photometric data ( with up to 18 photometric passbands per object ) , we have estimated photometric redshifts for 433 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the goods cdf  s field , using the photometric redshift method of bentez 2000 which incorporates bayesian magnitude / redshift priors .",
    "we find an overall performance @xmath51 , with better performance for some subsamples .",
    "the fraction of catastrophic redshift outliers is @xmath6910% , and is substantially smaller for galaxies with high values of the bayesian odds parameter .",
    "we see no strong trend in the performance of the photometric redshifts versus magnitudes , except for an increase in the outlier rate .",
    "employing a redshift / magnitude prior in this process seems to be crucial in reducing the scatter between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we have applied the method to two sub ",
    "samples of galaxies of particular interest : eros and agns .",
    "the results for eros are more accurate ( @xmath70 ) than for faint galaxies in general .",
    "they are somewhat less accurate for the x - ray sources ( i.e. agns)- ( @xmath71 ) , but good enough to be useful for many applications .",
