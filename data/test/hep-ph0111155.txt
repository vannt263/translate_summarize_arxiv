    "in modern particle physics , symmetries play extremely significant roles in solving problems related to various fine tunings . among them , in this paper , we consider two serious problems , that is , the strong cp problem and the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "taking account of the instanton effect , the @xmath0-parameter in qcd , which is given by parameter here is defined in the bases where all the quark masses are real . ]",
    "@xmath1 with @xmath2 being the gauge coupling constant for @xmath3 and @xmath4 the field strength of the gluon , is constrained to be smaller than @xmath5 @xcite ; otherwise , the electric dipole moment of the neutron becomes too large to be consistent with the experimental constraint .",
    "such a smallness is , however , unnatural in the standard model , since @xmath0 is just a parameter in the lagrangian .",
    "one smart solution to this problem is to introduce the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry @xcite , which is a spontaneously broken global abelian symmetry which is anomalous under qcd .",
    "with such a symmetry , which we call @xmath6 , nambu - goldstone boson ( called `` axion '' @xmath7 ) shows up and couples to the gluon as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the decay constant of the axion . in this case",
    ", the @xmath0 parameter is promoted to a dynamical variable . minimizing the potential of the axion , @xmath10 , and",
    "hence there is no strong cp problem in this case . since the pq symmetry solves the strong cp problem very beautifully , it is desirable to implement the pq symmetry in models of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "another serious fine - tuning in the standard model is related to the stability of the electroweak scale against radiative corrections ; in the standard model , radiative corrections to the higgs mass parameter quadratically diverge and hence the electroweak scale is expected to be as large as the cutoff scale . taking the cutoff at the gravitational scale , we need more than 30 orders of magnitude of fine tuning .    once the supersymmetry ( susy ) is introduced , quadratic divergences cancel between bosonic and fermionic diagrams . thus , susy is currently regarded as one of the most promising candidate of the solution to the naturalness problem , and we consider axion model in supersymmetric framework . among various models , in this paper , we consider the anomaly - mediated susy breaking model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the anomaly - mediated model may solve the susy cp and fcnc problems without fine tuning , since in this model , all susy breaking parameters are well controlled by the super - weyl ( sw ) anomaly . in addition , this model may provide solutions to cosmological difficulties such as gravitino problem and cosmological moduli problem @xcite .",
    "thus , we will study how axion models can be constructed in the framework of the anomaly - mediated models .",
    "in particular , in some class of the axion model , we will emphasize that the axion multiplet changes the prediction of the minimal anomaly - mediated model and that the negative slepton mass problem may be solved .",
    "we will show that , in this case , the resulting superparticle mass spectrum is similar to that of the deflected anomaly mediation @xcite .",
    "organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce several models of axion in the framework of the anomaly - mediated susy breaking .",
    "then , in section [ sec : pheno ] , we study phenomenology of models introduced in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "let us discuss the framework of our model .",
    "although our mechanism works in a large class of models with various particle content , we consider a model with @xmath11-pairs of @xmath12 and @xmath13 representations in the @xmath14 as an example .",
    "the particle content of our model is given in table [ table : particles ] , where the representations for the standard - model gauge groups as well as the charge for the @xmath6 are also shown . in our model ,",
    "the lowest component of @xmath15 acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and it breaks the @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "thus , we call @xmath15 as the axion multiplet .    .particle content of the model . the index",
    "@xmath16 is the flavor index which runs from 1 to @xmath11 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here we would like to discuss phenomenological issues of the models we presented .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , our models have superparticle masses identical to those in the deflected anomaly mediation . some of our results were already discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us first consider the model 1 . in this model ,",
    "the soft masses are given in eqs .",
    "( [ m_lam1 ] ) , ( [ m^2_f1 ] ) and ( [ a_f1 ] ) , which are parameterized by the scale of the susy breaking @xmath17 , the messenger scale @xmath18 and the number of the messenger fields @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , we have the @xmath20 and @xmath21 parameters . here",
    "we do not take any particular mechanism to generate them .",
    "@xmath20 is solely determined so as to reproduce the correct electroweak scale , and @xmath21 is related to @xmath22 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs in the mssm .",
    "thus the superparticle mass spectrum is specified by @xmath17 , @xmath23 , @xmath19 and @xmath24 .",
    "[ 0.5 ] as a function of the number of messengers @xmath25 .",
    "the light - shaded region is excluded by tachyonic slepton for @xmath26 .",
    "the lower limit for @xmath27 is also shown as a solid line .",
    "the dark - shaded region is excluded because the gauge coupling constants blow up below the gut scale.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.5 ] , except @xmath28 gev and @xmath29 gev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.5 ] , except @xmath28 gev and @xmath29 gev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.5 ] , except @xmath30 gev and @xmath29 gev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.5 ] , except @xmath30 gev and @xmath29 gev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to obtain a realistic mass spectrum ( positive slepton masses etc . ) , the number of the messenger should be large enough .",
    "in fact for @xmath31 , the gluino mass vanishes , resulting in an unrealistic mass spectrum . for @xmath32",
    ", we found that the sleptons are too light to survive the experimental mass bounds , unless the susy breaking scale is very high .",
    "this is disfavored , because the other superparticle masses will exceed 1 tev , causing the fine - tuning problem .",
    "thus we will consider the case @xmath33 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , we show the lower bound on the messenger scale @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "the bound comes from the two requirements : ( ) the positive slepton mass squared ( ) the perturbativity of the gauge coupling constants up to the gut scale .",
    "the former requirement is severer for smaller @xmath19 , while the latter is severer for larger @xmath25 .",
    "one finds that the messenger scale @xmath18 must be larger than @xmath34 gev.in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , we require that all the soft susy breaking mass squared parameters for sleptons be positive to make the figure being independent of @xmath35 .",
    "notice that such a constraint is slightly different from the actual experimental constraint based on the mass eigenvalues .",
    "( see figs.[fig : spect12 ] and [ fig : spect14 ] . )",
    "constraint on @xmath18 is , however , almost unchanged . in figs .",
    "[ fig : spect12 ] and [ fig : spect14 ] , the masses of some superparticles are shown for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "one finds that the lightest superparticle among the mssm particles is almost always a stau , the superpartner of the tau lepton .",
    "note that in the model 1 , the stau is not stable since the axino is the lightest superparticle and the stau decays to the axino .",
    "we will discuss phenomenological and cosmological implications to the stau decay .",
    "in addition , it is also notable that the slepton masses are more enhanced relative to the gauginos if we adopt larger value of @xmath18 .    in table",
    "[ table : spectrum ] , we show the superparticle mass spectrum for some typical cases.the higgs masses are computed by using the effective potential at one loop level .",
    "higher order corrections will somewhat reduce the @xmath38 mass .",
    "as we mentioned , the lightest superparticle in the mssm sector is the stau .",
    "the spectrum is rather compact , and squarks and gluinos are much lighter for the same stau mass than in the case of gauge mediation @xcite .",
    "another interesting point is that the lightest neutralino is higgsino - like , which is not achieved in many scenarios of supersymmetry breaking , including the minimal supergravity model with all the susy particles being lighter than @xmath39.in the focus point scenario of the supergravity model @xcite , however , the lightest neutralino becomes higgsino - like @xcite .",
    "in fact , one sees that the lightest and the second lightest neutralinos and the lighter chargino are quite degenerate in mass , indicating that they are higgsino - like .    in the minimal anomaly mediation , the sign of the gluino mass is opposite to that of the wino mass .",
    "this causes a potential conflict between the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath40 and br@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the result reported by the brookhaven e821 experiment @xcite suggests a deviation from the standard model prediction , indicating a new contribution from new physics .",
    "if this is real , the new physics should give a positive contribution to @xmath40 , which constrains the sign of @xmath42 @xmath43 in the context of susy .",
    "this choice also fixes the sign of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 in the minimal anomaly mediation ) .",
    "this sign plays an important role in the susy contributions to @xmath46 . with this choice ,",
    "the charged higgs loop and the chargino / stop loop give the contributions with the same sign , conflicting with the experimental constraints .",
    "one of the advantages of our scenario is that the gluino mass has the same sign as the wino mass as far as @xmath47 , and thus the two constraints can be simultaneously satisfied .    figs .",
    "[ fig : mdm12 ] and [ fig : mdm14 ] depict the susy contribution to @xmath48 in the model 1 for @xmath36 and @xmath49 .",
    "( for the formula for the susy contribution to @xmath48 , see @xcite , and for recent works see @xcite . ) in general , for a fixed value of of the gaugino mass , the stau mass decreases as @xmath24 increases .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned before , slepton mass relative to the gaugino mass becomes smaller as we adopt smaller value of the messenger scale . as a result , for relatively small @xmath18 , we obtain an upper bound on @xmath24 to evade the experimental upper bound on the stau mass , unless the overall scale of the susy breaking is large enough .",
    "( end points of the lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdm12 ] correspond to such points . )",
    "one consequence of this fact is that , when the messenger scale is low , the susy contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment is constrained to be relatively small , in particular , compared to the deviation observed by the e821 experiment . once the messenger scale is pushed up",
    ", however , the stau mass can be large enough and one finds that the requisite contribution of @xmath50 is easily realized .",
    "notice that , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 is required since the parameter @xmath53 has to be smaller than @xmath54 in our model .",
    "( see eq .",
    "( [ m_mess ] ) . ) for such a large value of @xmath9 , energy density of the axion field becomes larger than the critical density if the standard evolution of the universe is assumed @xcite . for a possible cosmological scenario in this case ,",
    "see the next subsection .",
    "we also studied the superparticle mass spectrum for the model 2 . a typical mass spectrum in this case",
    "is given in table 2 as well .",
    "the lightest superparticle in the mssm sector is again the stau .",
    "because the axino is heavy in the model 2 , the stau becomes the lsp in the whole theory .",
    "since such a charged lsp is ruled out cosmologically @xcite , it must decay through @xmath55-parity violation .",
    "furthermore the superparticle masses are somewhat spread compared to the previous case , which may cause the naturalness problem .",
    "thus we conclude that the model 2 is less attractive than the model 1 .",
    "let us return to the model 1 , and consider the effects of the stau decay into the axino .",
    "the axion - multiplet coupling to the matter is suppressed by the decay constant @xmath56 .",
    "since we are considering the hadronic axion , the axion coupling to leptons vanishes at tree level .",
    "in fact , it arises at two - loop order , which originates from the anomalous coupling of the axion to two photons .",
    "equivalently one can compute this coupling by using the superfield techniques .",
    "the axion coupling is then contained in the field dependent wave function renormalization of the lepton multiplet .",
    "the same technique enables us to compute the axino - lepton - slepton coupling in a simple matter as in ref .",
    "their result is given for the right - handed slepton @xmath57 where @xmath58.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows from this that the lifetime of the stau is approximately @xmath59 thus in collider experiments , the staus do not decay inside detectors , and they are practically regarded as stable particles .",
    "thus highly ionized tracks produced by the heavy charged particles will be a signature of this scenario @xcite .",
    "cosmological implications of our model are also interesting since there exist various exotic particles in our model , like axion , axino , and saxino , which may affect evolution of the universe . in particular , in the model 1 , saxino may significantly affect the cosmology , contrary to the conventional scenario . therefore , let us comment on this point .    in the model 1 ,",
    "there are two relatively light scalar fields , which are axion and saxino .",
    "the initial amplitude of these fields are in general displaced from the minimum of the potential and they start to oscillate as the universe expands . as a result , we should worry about cosmological difficulties possibly caused by these coherent oscillations .",
    "the effects of the axion field have been extensively studied .",
    "the effects of the saxino is quite different from those of the axion , since in our model the saxino is much heavier than the axion .",
    "consequently , the lifetime of the saxino becomes much shorter than that of axion , and hence the saxino may decay before the present epoch .",
    "the saxino @xmath60 dominantly decays into the axion pair , and the lifetime is calculated as @xmath61^{-1 }       \\simeq 10\\ { \\rm sec }      \\times c_2^{-1 } \\lambda^{-1 }      \\left ( \\frac{f_\\phi}{\\rm 100\\ tev } \\right)^{-3 }      \\left(\\frac{n_{\\bf 5}}{8}\\right)^{-1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we approximated that the mass of the saxino is comparable to @xmath62 .",
    "the lifetime is much longer than 1 sec as far as @xmath63 and @xmath64 . as a result ,",
    "if the coherent oscillation exists in the early universe , it decays after the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) starts .",
    "therefore , if the energy density of @xmath60 is too large at the time of the bbn , it spoils the great success of it . assuming that the initial amplitude of the saxino field as @xmath65 , the saxino energy density normalized by the entropy density is estimated as @xmath66 notice that this ratio is independent of time .",
    "important constraint on the saxino abundance is from the overproduction of @xmath67he . if the saxino energy density is too large at the time of the neutron decoupling , it boosts up the expansion rate of the universe and increases the freeze - out temperature of the neutron .",
    "if this happens , the neutron number density after the freeze out becomes larger , resulting in an overproduction of @xmath67he . to avoid this problem",
    ", the ratio @xmath68 should be much smaller than the ratio @xmath69 at the time of the neutron decoupling , and we obtain an upper bound on @xmath53 of @xmath70 , corresponding to @xmath71 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , with the messenger scale lower than @xmath72 , a large number of the messenger multiplet should be introduced in order to avoid the tachyonic sfermion mass , which makes the gauge coupling constants non - perturbative below the gut scale .",
    "one might think that we may have a consistent scenario of cosmology if @xmath73 . in this case , however , the lifetime of the saxino is as long as @xmath74 and hence the saxino decays after dominating the universe . since the saxino dominantly decays into the axions , energy density of the axion becomes 2 @xmath75 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of the radiation and",
    "hence there exists large extra energy density in the form of the relativistic matter ( i.e. , the axion ) .",
    "first , this fact changes the epoch of the radiation - matter equality to @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , the axion is a very weakly interacting particle and hence the cosmic density fluctuation for the scale which enters the horizon before the equality is washed out by the effect of the free - streaming .",
    "these effects cause a serious difficulty in the galaxy formation .",
    "furthermore , some part of the saxino will decay into the pion pair through the qcd anomaly .",
    "such pions dissociate the light elements produced by the bbn and spoil the great success of the standard bbn .",
    "thus , we should conclude that the scenario with @xmath77 does not work .",
    "therefore , if we assume the conventional scenario of cosmology , our model has a serious cosmological disaster .",
    "this problem is , however , easily solved if a large amount of entropy is produced after the onset of the saxino oscillation . with a large entropy production ,",
    "the energy density of the saxino field is diluted and the ratio @xmath68 becomes much smaller than the value given in eq .",
    "( [ rho / s ] ) . in the anomaly - mediated models ,",
    "the moduli fields may be heavy and they can become a natural source of the late - time entropy production .",
    "it is also important to point out that , if a large late - time entropy production occurs , axinos are also diluted .",
    "thus , the axino relic density becomes much smaller than the present critical density even if the axinos are thermally produced in the early universe . in addition , if the entropy production occurs after the qcd phase transition , coherent oscillation of the axion field is also diluted and the cosmological bound on the axion scale @xmath9 can be relaxed @xcite . in this case , @xmath9 much larger than @xmath78 becomes possible .",
    "this fact may be of some help if a relatively large value of the susy contribution to the muon magnetic moment is required , as mentioned in the previous subsection .",
    "it should be also noted that the relic staus are also diluted by the entropy production .",
    "thus , the relic staus do not significantly affect the bbn even if their lifetime is longer than @xmath79 .",
    "the scenario with the late - time entropy production by the modulus decay may be tested by precisely measuring the cosmic microwave anisotropy since the decay of the modulus field may generate correlated mixture of the adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations @xcite .    in the model 2 ,",
    "the axino and saxino are as heavy as @xmath80 . as a result , they are short - lived , and irrelevant in cosmology .",
    "in this paper , we have considered hadronic axion models in the supersymmetric theory where susy breaking is mediated by the super - weyl anomaly .",
    "susy breaking plays an important role in determining the vev of the axion multiplet @xmath15 which spontaneously breaks @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "we constructed three models in each of which the role of the susy breaking is different .",
    "the first model has no superpotential for @xmath15 and thus the scalar potential solely comes from susy breaking .",
    "in fact , the vev of @xmath15 is determined by the balance between the two terms : one is the negative soft susy breaking mass generated by the super - weyl anomaly , and the other is from the higher order term in the khler potential . in the second model , the pq symmetry would not be broken in the absence of the susy breaking . once the susy breaking is switched on , the potential minimum shift to the vacuum with the symmetry breaking . in the third model , the pq symmetry is already broken in the exact susy limit , but the vacuum is degenerate along a non - compact flat direction .",
    "it is then the effect of the susy breaking that lifts the flat direction , thus fixing the pq scale . in all three models ,",
    "the pq scale can be adjusted to the allowed range by appropriate choice of the coupling constants .    in the first two models , the pq multiplet possesses non - trivial susy breaking , and thus it mediates susy breaking to the mssm sector via a mechanism similar to the gauge mediation .",
    "then soft susy breaking masses are deflected from those from the pure anomaly mediation .",
    "our models provide a realization of the deflected anomaly mediation advocated in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand , in the model 3",
    "the @xmath15 field has trivial susy breaking , and thus it does not affect the mass spectrum of the superparticles in the mssm . therefore the sleptons remain tachyonic unless some other mechanism lifts up the slepton masses .",
    "phenomenological issues of the models 1 and 2 are briefly discussed . in these models ,",
    "the stau becomes the lightest superparticle in the mssm sector . in collider experiments ,",
    "charged tracks due to the stau will be an important signature of the models .",
    "we also computed the susy contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "we found that , despite relatively heavy winos , the contribution from the susy sector can be comparable to or even larger than that from the weak interaction sector .",
    "thus it can easily explain the possible discrepancy from the standard model prediction reported by the e821 experiment .",
    "one of the crucial differences between the two models is the mass of the axino . in the model 1 ,",
    "the axino is light and becomes the lightest superparticle of the whole theory . in this case , the stau is no longer stable , but decays to the axino , with lifetime typically larger than 1 sec . in the model 2",
    ", the axino acquires mass at the tree level and thus it is as heavy as the gravitino . in this case , the stau will be the lsp of the whole sector and so we need @xmath55-parity violation to avoid the charged stable particle .",
    "we also discussed cosmology of the models . in model 1 , the saxino is light and long - lived .",
    "we argued that its coherent oscillation would spoil the success of the bbn . to avoid it",
    ", we invoke the late time entropy production , and thus cosmological evolution of the model 1 should differ from the standard thermal history of the universe . on the other hand , in model 2 , the saxino has a mass comparable to @xmath17 , and thus is heavy .",
    "thus it is short - lived , and cosmologically harmless .",
