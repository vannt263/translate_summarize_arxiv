    "after the confirmation of the existence of the higgs particle @xcite , it is become mandatory to improve our understanding of this sector of the standard model , firstly postulated by weinberg and salam @xcite , both from the experimental and theoretical sides . the scalar field that describes this particle has been put forward in the sixties @xcite and has never been exploited beyond a perturbative treatment to which is supposed to be amenable .",
    "indeed , questions like the true spectrum of such a model or the exact form of the propagators were never properly answered .",
    "rather , it is by now a well acquired fact that this theory is plagued by triviality , that is , it can not exist as an interacting theory .",
    "this question was recently addressed , for the four dimensional case , in @xcite for the strong coupling limit and for the full range in @xcite .",
    "also , this theory suffers from the hierarchy problem arising from the corrections to the mass term that would imply that the mass of the higgs particle should be as large as the planck mass due to perturbative corrections .",
    "this aspect of the theory is under scrutiny yet and waiting for experimental inputs from the just restarted lhc .    in this paper",
    "we add a further exact result to the higgs sector of the standard model by deriving the exact spectrum of the theory in the broken phase .",
    "the interesting point is that a finite value for the quartic coupling is enough to grant exact solutions to the classical theory and , in turn , a well definite spectrum for the quantum counterpart .",
    "this spectrum is a superimposed one on the mass of the higgs particle and appears like substructures are at work .",
    "this could be explained by a higher level theory as string theory or technicolor .",
    "it appears like a mathematical property of the higgs field and should be taken into account when studying it .    as a by - product of this theorem",
    ", we provide a mathematical technique to solve partial differential equations like that for the green function using lorentz invariance and fourier transform .",
    "this result is in agreement with our conclusions in @xcite .",
    "here we show how the higgs sector in the standard model just implies an extended spectrum of massive excitations .",
    "we confirm these results in quantum field theory by solving the dyson - schwinger equations of the theory omitting the quadratic coupling of the gauge fields to the higgs field and interaction with fermion fields .",
    "this entails a proof of triviality for the theory .",
    "we emphasize that we limit our analysis strictly to the scalar sector of the standard model .",
    "this is a strong approximation as other fields like fermions and gauge bosons can change the observables we consider . but",
    "this is meaningful as a leading order understanding of the behavior of this part of the model that further corrections are not expected to change dramatically .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secii ] we present the exact solutions for the higgs sector of the standard model and the the green functions of the classical theory . in sec .",

    "we yield the conclusions .",
    "we consider the higgs sector of the standard model given by @xcite @xmath0 being @xmath1 so that @xmath2 . from this one",
    "has the following equations of motion @xmath3 we assume @xmath4 for the vacuum expectation value of the theory , as usual in the higgs mechanism .",
    "the coupling with the gauge fields yields the lagrangian @xmath5 being @xcite @xmath6 and the equations of motion change accordingly .",
    "the presence of fermion fields @xmath7 will complete the higgs sector as @xmath8\\ ] ] being @xmath9 the yukawa couplings .",
    "this appears like a current term for the equation of the scalar field and so , it is not relevant for the determination of the spectrum .",
    "the situation is somewhat different for the gauge fields where a term depending on the square of the scalar field appears .",
    "this is depressed as the ratio of the square of the masses of the gauge bosons to the square of the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "then , we will consider it relevant just perturbatively for the computation of the spectrum and so we will omit this in our analysis .",
    "it should be noted that , adding other fields , can not dramatically change our conclusions for the scalar sector .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eq : eom ] ) admit an exact solution by introducing two different phases , u and b , and writing down @xmath10 being for the unbroken phase , @xmath11 , @xmath12 provided the following dispersion relation does hold @xmath13 this solution is obtained with @xmath14 and @xmath15 being two integration constants and sn a jacobi elliptic function having parameter @xmath16 .",
    "these solutions hold with the condition @xmath11 .",
    "we see that , already at classical level , the mass @xmath17 gets renormalized by the self - interaction with a coupling @xmath18 .",
    "it is enough that the self - coupling is finite to get such a solution .",
    "we note that this solution reduces to the known case for @xmath19 given in @xcite",

    "this holds provided the following dispersion relation holds @xmath24 so , our exact solution describes oscillations around the value @xmath25 as expected from a physical point of view .",
    "the green function for the theory can be obtained by the functional derivative of the equations @xmath26 with respect to @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "then , the equations for the green functions do not imply any nonlinear term .",
    "the only physical component for the higgs field is the real component of @xmath31 .",
    "we get @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 must to be computed at @xmath35 and @xmath36 reducing at the exact solutions of the preceding section .",
    "consistently , we can assume that @xmath37 and then , these equations for the green functions reduce to a single one @xmath38 this yields the equation for the green function of the higgs field in the broken phase @xmath39",

    "this can be accomplished by noting that the homogeneous equation has the following solution @xmath40 provided the dispersion relation ( [ eq : drb ] ) holds . as we will see below ,",
    "all we need is to evaluate @xmath41 as this distribution keeps all the information on the spectrum of the theory . in order to get this propagator",
    "we rewrite the above equation as @xmath42 ^ 2\\delta_h(x,0)=\\delta^4(x)-\\delta_2\\delta_h(x,0).\\ ] ] and iterate starting with the solution of the equation @xmath43",
    "^ 2\\delta_h^0(x,0)=\\delta^4(x)\\ ] ] being @xmath44 and @xmath45 the phase @xmath46 can be taken to be zero .",
    "this can be fourier transformed to yield @xmath47 being @xmath48 the mass spectrum that also entails a zero mass value , the goldstone boson .",
    "@xmath49 is a complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "the next iterate takes the form @xmath50",
    "^ 2\\delta_h^1(x,0)=\\delta^4(x)-\\delta_2\\delta_h^0(x,0)=\\delta^4(x)-g(t)\\delta_2\\delta^3(x)\\ ] ] remembering that should be interpreted in the sense of distribution just noting that @xmath51 .",
    "therefore we will get @xmath52 that is @xmath53 that we can fourier transform to give @xmath54 this procedure can be iterated how far we want and we recover the fact that we are just obtaining the correction due to momentum @xmath55 in the denominator of @xmath56 producing the full propagator .",
    "this result implies that we have immediately the exact propagator for the higgs field in the classical theory but , assuming that translation invariance is a property of the theory , we would have got it just moving from the rest frame with a boost obtaining @xmath57 thus , we have provided in this way a general mathematical technique to solve equations like ( [ eq : gh ] ) reducing them to ordinary differential equations .",
    "the linearity of the partial differential equation played a relevant role .",
    "this represents the key result of our paper .",
    "we will show in the following sections the way the mass spectrum @xmath58 enters into the theory . also , it is important to note that higher excited states appear to be exponentially depressed and so , really difficult to observe .",
    "given eq.([eq : prop ] ) , the classical theory is completely solved as already shown in  @xcite .",
    "we note that , notwithstanding the `` wrong '' sign in the mass term , the solutions satisfy a correct dispersion relation and so , we obtain a proper spectrum for the quantum theory .",
    "in order to complete our argument , we solve the quantum theory of the higgs field .",
    "this is accomplished by solving the hierarchy of dyson - schwinger equations for this case using the technique devised in @xcite .",
    "we apply our analysis to the only surviving component of the field that we dub @xmath59 .",
    "this is needed to support the conclusions of this paper .",
    "we emphasize that , when all the contributions to the higgs sector are considered , dyson - schwinger equations can not be amenable to the treatment we present here but this provides a qualitative understanding on its behavior and has the prerogative to be an exact results at this order of approximation . in the dyson - schwinger set of equations ,",
    "the equation for a n - point correlation function depends on higher order correlation functions .",
    "so , one could thing that a truncation is needed .",
    "this is not the case here as we get an exact solution . in order to get such an exact solution , we put the contribution arising from higher order correlation functions at a given order to zero",
    ". then , we check _ a posteriori _ that this choice is a correct one .",
    "this is possible as , in the hierarchy we obtain , such functions enter in a special way that grants that can be nullified .",
    "but the check can only be executed _ a posteriori _ as we are going to see .",
    "the quantum equation of motion is @xmath60 where @xmath61 contains the fermion currents coupled to the higgs field through yukawa couplings and the currents originating from the couplings with the gauge fields .",
    "the contribution coming from the square of the higgs field coupled to the gauge fields is neglected as it goes with the ratio between the masses of the gauge bosons and the squared vacuum expectation value of the higgs field that is higher .",
    "so , this latter corrections should be considered by perturbation theory eventually and will be omitted in our solution of the dyson - schwinger equations in a first instance .",
    "the generating functional coming from the standard model can be written , in a first approximation as already stated , as @xmath62=z_0\\int[d\\phi]e^{i\\int d^4x\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial\\phi_h)^2+\\frac{1}{2}|\\mu^2|\\phi_h^2-\\frac{2\\lambda}{4}\\phi_h^4+j\\phi_h\\right]}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 contains all other fields of the standard model and we are neglecting the quadratic correction arising from the gauge fields .",

    "one has @xmath117 being @xmath118 the spectral density .",
    "the spectral density contains the characteristics of the spectrum of the theory and takes the general form @xmath119 where the first term represents the excitations of the field and the last term corresponds to the interaction producing bound states .",

    "similarly , atlas finds @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "currently , errors are too large yet to draw a conclusion .",

    "comparison with results in perturbation theory are not straightforward in our case because we are expanding around non - constant solutions of the classical theory , the main reference being in this case @xcite .",
    "anyhow , a renormalization group study of the theory is also possible deriving the beta function from the 4-point correlation functions .",
    "we just note that the 2-point function does not depend on the coupling @xmath18 and so , it says nothing about the beta function .",
    "so , we consider the 4-point function given by @xmath106.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that the second term is independent on @xmath18 as it contains the 1-point function @xmath89 going like @xmath131 .",
    "also , @xmath76 depends on @xmath89 and brings another identical contribution canceling the @xmath18 factor that multiplies the term .",

    "this proves that the theory is infrared trivial as lowering momenta moves the coupling toward zero as it should be expected .",
    "we note that the beta function is proportional to the spacetime dimensionality .",
    "this was already observed in @xcite .",
    "in order to get a consistent quantum theory we have to prove that the set of solutions we obtained are indeed unique . this can be seen by introducing the new variable @xmath136 into the more general equation @xmath137 yielding @xmath138 that can be stated in the form @xmath139 now , we can rescale it writing @xmath140 being @xmath141 a constant .",

    "the application of the feynman - kac formula at this stage is straightforward and we can conclude that _ the higgs potential in the standard model entails a continuous spectrum of free particles having a superimposed discrete spectrum of masses . _",
    "the argument runs similarly for the unbroken phase .",
    "this means that higher excited states of the observed particle should be expected even if these are exponentially damped and so even more difficult to be seen than the ground state .",
