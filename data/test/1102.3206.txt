    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most powerful explosions in the universe , and are thus considered to be a possible source of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays .",
    "short - duration bursts are believed to be a result of the collision of two compact objects and long - duration bursts are thought to be beamed emission from the collapse of a high - mass star into a black hole .",
    "see  @xcite for reviews of the basic theories of grbs",
    ". in the widely - accepted fireball shock model , relativistic plasma in a jet collides either with the surrounding material or with the outflow itself , producing the observed gamma - ray prompt emission through synchrotron and inverse compton scattering of electrons  @xcite .",
    "protons are also thought to be accelerated in these shocks via the fermi mechanism  @xcite .",
    "these uhe protons then interact with the photons , going through a @xmath10 resonance and producing charged pions which decay , yielding uhe neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the first calculations of this prompt uhe neutrino emission use an e@xmath11 proton injection spectrum with energies up to e=@xmath12  gev , and predict an e@xmath13 neutrino spectrum in the uhe regime , with the steepening of the spectrum due to synchrotron cooling of the uhe pions  @xcite .",
    "the detection of uhe neutrinos from grbs would support their identification as the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays , a longstanding mystery in particle astrophysics .",
    "previous searches for neutrino production have been perfomed by the icecube  @xcite and rice collaborations  @xcite , but this is the first search for uhe neutrinos from grbs above 10@xmath9  gev .",
    "a full description of the anita - i instrument can be found in  @xcite , and a description of instrument modifications for anita - ii is in  @xcite  and  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the anita experiment is a nasa long duration balloon experiment that searches for coherent , impulsive , broadband radio emission ( 200 - 1200  mhz ) from electromagnetic showers induced by uhe neutrinos interacting in the antarctic ice sheet  @xcite .",
    "the second flight of the anita experiment launched on 2008 december 21 , flew for 31 days , 28.5 of which were live days , and recorded over 26  million triggers .",
    "forty quad - ridged , dual - polarization horn antennas search for radio impulses which could be caused by neutrino interactions in the ice sheet .",
    "the trigger requires coherent power in neighboring antennas , and the threshold is limited by thermal - noise emission from the ice . over 98.5% of recorded events were fluctuations of thermal noise .",
    "the trigger is designed to optimize efficiency on neutrino - like signals : vertically - polarized , broadband impulses .",
    "signals from each polarization of each antenna are recorded in a 100  ns window for each triggered event , allowing for directional determination on an event - by - event basis using interferometric techniques , also described at length in  @xcite .",
    "anita is most sensitive to neutrinos which come from between the horizon and a payload elevation angle ( angle above the horizontal ) of @xmath14 .",
    "we are able to construct a more sensitive search for uhe neutrinos from grbs compared to the previously reported diffuse uhe neutrino search with anita - ii  @xcite because the short time window given by the burst duration dramatically reduces background in the signal region , allowing us to lower our analysis threshold and look for very weak signals which also have a time and direction correlation with the observed grb .",
    "there are two sources of background for an anita neutrino search .",
    "the first is thermal - noise fluctuations , which are easily removed with a set of cuts on the strength of waveform correlation among neighboring antennas and the signal strength .",
    "the second is man - made noise , which can be removed because it tends to cluster with locations of known human activity and with other events .",
    "the details of event reconstruction , thermal - noise rejection , and man - made noise rejection are discussed in  @xcite  and  @xcite .",
    "compared to the diffuse neutrino search , we loosen numerical values of thermal - noise cuts . the cuts against man - made noise",
    "remain the same .",
