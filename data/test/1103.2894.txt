    "in this article we consider self - similar solutions to smoluchowski s mean - field model for coagulation @xcite that is given by the equation @xmath12\\ , , \\label{s1e1}\\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes the number density of clusters of size @xmath14 at time @xmath15 .",
    "the kernel @xmath16 describes the rate of coalescence of clusters of size @xmath14 and @xmath17 and subsumes all the microscopic aspects of the coagulation process .",
    "it is well - known , cf .",
    "for example the review article @xcite and references therein , that if the kernel grows at most linearly , then the initial value problem for ( [ s1e1 ] ) is well - posed for initial data with finite mass and the mass is conserved for all times .",
    "for homogeneous kernels it is furthermore expected that solutions converge to a self - similar form for large times .",
    "in fact , for the kernels @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the constant and additive kernel respectively , this issue has by now been completely solved .",
    "it has been established @xcite that besides explicitly known exponentially decaying self - similar solutions also solutions with algebraic decay exist . in @xcite",
    "their domains of attraction could also be completely characterized .",
    "however , not much is known about self - similar solutions for other kernels than these solvable ones .",
    "existence of fast - decaying self - similar solutions has been established for a large class of kernels @xcite , and local properties of such solutions have been investigated in @xcite , but it is not known whether they are unique in the class of solutions with finite mass .",
    "it is also not clear , not even on the formal level , whether self - similar solutions with algebraic decay exist .    in this article",
    "we will consider mass - conserving self - similar solutions to coagulation equations with the following product kernel of homogeneity @xmath20 : @xmath21 existence of a solution for this kernel has been established in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an asymptotic description of such a solution in the regime @xmath22 .",
    "let us describe briefly what is known for self - similar solutions for kernels as in ( [ s1e2 ] ) and compare it to results for the so - called sum kernels . to fix ideas , we restrict ourselves to kernels of the form @xmath23 even though most of the results that we mention also apply to more general kernels with the same growth behavior as the ones in ( [ s1e2b ] ) .",
    "we will need in particular to distinguish between the case @xmath24 , the sum kernel , and the case @xmath25 , the product kernel .",
    "it has long been predicted @xcite that self - similar solutions for kernels as in ( [ s1e2b ] ) exhibit a singular power - law behavior of the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 in the case @xmath24 , and @xmath28 for the case @xmath25 .",
    "this has been rigorously proved for the case @xmath24 in @xcite and for the case @xmath25 in @xcite . as has been pointed out in @xcite , the next order behavior for small clusters in the case @xmath24",
    "can then easily be established and is as predicted by the physicists . in the case",
    "@xmath25 , however , the next order behavior has not been known @xcite , and only numerical simulations suggested that it is oscillatory @xcite .    our goal in this paper is to describe formally how to construct mass - conserving self - similar solutions for kernels as in ( [ s1e2 ] ) in the limit @xmath22 and by this also describe their asymptotic behavior on the whole positive real line . while we believe that such self - similar solutions are unique",
    ", our approach only gives the construction of one such solution .",
    "in forthcoming work @xcite we will also show how to make this construction rigorous .",
    "we will see that in the limit @xmath22 the oscillatory character of the solutions becomes very explicit and can be interpreted in terms of simple odes coupled with explicitly solvable equations .    in the limit @xmath29",
    "the product kernel becomes close to the sum kernel @xmath30 .",
    "as described above the power law for the sum kernel is different from the one for the product kernel .",
    "this is due to the fact that , thinking in terms of coagulating particles , the physical behaviour of these particles is different in these two cases .",
    "indeed , the power law obtained for the sum case shows that particles with small @xmath8 coalesce mostly with particles that are much bigger than themselves . on the contrary ,",
    "in the case of the product kernel small particles interact mostly with the ones having a comparable size .",
    "the point @xmath31 can be thought as a bifurcation point where both kind of behaviours take place simultaneously .",
    "we are now going to derive the equations that are solved by self - similar solutions .",
    "it is known that the coagulation equation ( [ s1e1 ] ) can be written in the following conservative form that makes the conservation of the number of monomers @xmath32 transparent .",
    "@xmath33    using the self - similar variables @xmath34 as well as the form of the kernel ( [ s1e2 ] ) , equation ( [ s2e1 ] ) becomes @xmath35 integrating this equation , assuming decay of the solutions as @xmath36 and imposing absence of particle fluxes , we obtain @xmath37 the balance of the terms on both sides of ( [ s2e2 ] ) suggests the following power law behaviour for @xmath38 near the origin , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the classical beta function @xcite .",
    "for further reference we notice that @xmath41    in order to remove the power law behaviour we introduce the new function @xmath42 then @xmath9 solves @xmath43 in the rest of the paper we will study solutions of ( [ s2e5 ] ) in the limit @xmath22 that satisfy @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "notice that ( [ s2e5 ] ) has the explicit constant solution @xmath46 that corresponds to the well - known solution with infinite mass @xmath47 in the formulation ( [ s2e2 ] ) .",
    "a main idea in our approach is to reformulate the problem of finding solutions of ( [ s2e5 ] ) as a shooting problem for a volterra integro - differential equation .",
    "indeed , we can rewrite ( [ s2e5 ] ) as @xmath48 differentiating ( [ s3e5 ] ) we obtain the equations @xmath49 thus the solution of ( [ s2e5 ] ) solves ( [ s3e7 ] ) with @xmath9 as in ( [ s3e4 ] ) , that has the advantage of being a volterra integro - differential equation .",
    "however , the problem ( [ s3e4 ] ) , ( [ s3e7 ] ) admits solutions that in general do not decay as @xmath50 and therefore they do not provide solutions of ( [ s2e5 ] ) . therefore , among all the solutions of ( [ s3e4 ] ) , ( [ s3e7 ] ) we must select those satisfying @xmath51      we now sketch the asymptotics of the solution that we are going to construct .",
    "it passes , roughly speaking , through three stages that are described in detail in sections [ s.zero ] , [ combregion ] and [ s.asymptotics ] respectively .",
    "section [ s.zero ] discusses the behavior of the solution near @xmath52 .",
    "as pointed out before , near the origin the solution is oscillatory and behaves as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 as @xmath22 .",
    "our analysis consists of constructing a solution by starting with @xmath9 as in ( [ oscillations ] ) and using @xmath56 as a shooting parameter .",
    "however , since equation ( [ s2e5 ] ) is invariant under the rescaling @xmath57 for @xmath58 , we can restrict the range of @xmath59 to @xmath60 ( see also the comment in section [ ss.variables ] ) . in this regime near the origin",
    "we can approximate ( [ s3e4 ] ) and ( [ s3e5 ] ) by a nonlinear ode ( see ( [ s5e6 ] ) ) , that is a perturbation of a simple ode system . for the perturbed system we can use an adiabatic approximation to compute the increase of an associated energy @xmath61 along trajectories . as we discuss in section [ ss.validity ] this first ode approximation is valid as long as @xmath62 . when @xmath63 we enter a new regime that is described in section [ combregion ] . in this regime",
    "@xmath9 develops peaks of height @xmath10 and width of order one that are separated by wide regions in which @xmath9 is small .",
    "the regime where @xmath9 is small is again described by an ode ( cf .",
    "section [ ss.ode ] ) , while the peaks are described by an integro - differential equation ( see section [ ss.integro ] ) .",
    "the analysis of these respective regimes is done in sections [ ss.intanalysis ] and [ ss.odeanalysis ] , while their coupling is described in section [ asymptpeaks ] . in section [ s.shooting ]",
    "we will then show by a continuity argument that there exists a shooting parameter such that the corresponding solution @xmath9 converges to zero as @xmath45 . in the third regime , that is discussed in section [ s.asymptotics ] , @xmath9 then decays exponentially fast to zero .",
    "it has been observed in @xcite that the self - similar solutions associated with ( [ s1e1 ] ) exhibit oscillations for small values of @xmath65 this oscillatory behaviour can be seen as follows . if we make the ansatz @xmath66 with some @xmath67 , plug this into ( [ s2e5 ] ) and keep only the leading order terms , we obtain that @xmath68 must satisfy @xmath69 after some computations , we find that this is equivalent to @xmath70    one can show that @xmath71 has two complex conjugate roots @xmath72 with positive real part and nonzero imaginary part .",
    "indeed , in the limit @xmath6 this can be seen easily as the dominating terms in ( [ s3e3 ] ) are , assuming @xmath73 , @xmath74 and thus the roots of @xmath71 satisfy @xmath75    consequently we expect the following asymptotics for the solutions of ( [ s2e5]):@xmath76 for suitable real constants @xmath77 and @xmath78    notice that the asymptotics ( [ s2e6 ] ) indicate that two consecutive local maxima of @xmath9 , called @xmath79 and @xmath80 , satisfy @xmath81 for small @xmath82 in comparison , to double the amplitude of ( [ s2e6 ] ) we must multiply @xmath8 by a number of order @xmath83 . thus ,",
    "the behaviour ( [ s2e6 ] ) is essentially oscillatory , with a growth in the amplitude that takes place on a much larger scale .      for our forthcoming analysis",

    "this in particular implies that the corresponding self - similar solution @xmath38 has finite mass .",

    "however , we notice that ( [ s3e10])-([s3e13 ] ) is invariant under translations @xmath96 and thus all the complex numbers in the spiral @xmath97  yield the same solution up to translations .",
    "thus we can identify the solutions of ( [ s3e10])-([s3e13 ] ) satisfying ( [ s4ea ] ) , up to translations , with the set of positive real numbers contained between two consecutive intersections of @xmath98 with the real axis .",
