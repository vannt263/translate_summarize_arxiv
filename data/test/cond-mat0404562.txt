    "the model of quantum lattice bose gas has a long history and has been suggested initially for conventional superconductors @xcite , quantum crystals such as @xmath4he where superfluidity coexists with a crystalline order.@xcite afterwards , the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model has been studied as a model of the superconductor - insulator transition in materials with local bosons , bipolarons , or preformed cooper pairs.@xcite two - dimensional bh models have been addressed as relevant to describe the superconducting films and josephson junction arrays .",
    "the most recent interest to the system of hard - core bosons comes from the delightful results on bose - einstein ( be ) condensed atomic systems produced by trapping bosonic neutral atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "@xcite the progress in boson physics generates an especial interest around nonlinear topological excitations ( skyrmions , vortices ) which play an increasingly significant role in physics .",
    "one of the fundamental hot debated problems in bosonic physics concerns the evolution of the charge ordered ( co ) ground state of 2d hard - core bh model ( hc - bh ) with a doping away from half - filling .",
    "numerous model studies steadily confirmed the emergence of `` supersolid '' phases with simultaneous diagonal and off - diagonal long range order while penrose and onsager @xcite were the first showing as early as 1956 that supersolid phases do not occur .",
    "the most recent quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) simulations @xcite found two significant features of the 2d bose - hubbard model with a screened coulomb repulsion : the absence of supersolid phase at half - filling , and a growing tendency to phase separation ( co+bs ) upon doping away from half - filling .",
    "moreover , batrouni and scalettar @xcite studied quantum phase transitions in the ground state of the 2d hard - core boson hubbard hamiltonian and have shown numerically that , contrary to the generally held belief , the most commonly discussed `` checkerboard '' supersolid is thermodynamically unstable and phase separates into solid and superfluid phases .",
    "the physics of the co+bs phase separation in bose - hubbard model is associated with a rapid increase of the energy of a homogeneous co state with doping away from half - filling due to a large `` pseudo - spin - flip '' energy cost .",
    "hence , it appears to be energetically more favorable to `` extract '' extra bosons ( holes ) from the co state and arrange them into finite clusters with a relatively small number of particles .",
    "such a droplet scenario is believed to minimize the long - range coulomb repulsion .",
    "however , immediately there arise several questions .",
    "whether a simple mean - field approximation ( mfa ) and classical continuum model can predict such a behavior ?",
    "what is the detailed structure of the co+bs phase separated state ?",
    "what are the main factors governing the essential low - energy and long - wavelength physics ? is it possible to make use of simple toy models ?",
    "are there the analogies with fermion hubbard model ?",
    "the behavior of the latter under doping away from half - filling is extensively studied in last decade in frames of stripe scenario which implies that doping may proceed through the formation of stripes , or charged domain walls being specific topological solitons in nel antiferromagnets . in particular , emery and",
    "kivelson @xcite argued that the phase separation reflects a universal tendency of the correlated antiferromagnet to expel the doped holes .",
    "white and scalapino @xcite showed that the pure 2d t - j model , in the small - j / t regime and with dopings near @xmath5 , has a striped ground state .",
    "in general , the topological phase separation is believed to be a generic property of 2d fermion hubbard model .    in the paper",
    "we present a topological scenario of co+bs phase separation in 2d hc - bh model with inter - site repulsion .",
    "the extra bosons / holes doped to a checkerboard co phase of 2d boson system are believed to be confined in the ring - shaped domain wall of the skyrmion - like topological defect which looks like a bubble domain in an easy - axis antiferromagnet .",
    "this allows us to propose the mechanism of 2d _ topological _ co+bs _ phase separation _ when the doping of the bare checkerboard co phase results in the formation of a multi - center topological defect , which simplified pseudo - spin pattern looks like a system of bubble co domains with bose superfluid confined in charged ring - shaped domain walls .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we give a short overview of the conventional hc - bh model in frames of a pseudo - spin formalism and mfa description .",
    "in sec.iii we show that the doping in 2d hc - bh system can be accompanied by the formation of a topological defect like a single or multi - center skyrmion .",
    "we present the scenario of the essential low - energy physics for the topologically doped hc - bh system . in sec.iv",
    "we address a simple model of nanoscopic bubble - like domain in a checkerboard co phase for a discrete square lattice that allows us to demonstrate a subtle microscopic structure of such a center with a multi - component order parameter .",
    "the hamiltonian of hard - core bose gas on a lattice can be written in a standard form as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the projection operator which removes double occupancy of any site , @xmath8 , @xmath9 the chemical potential determined from the condition of fixed full number of bosons @xmath10 or concentration @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath12 denotes an effective transfer integral , @xmath13 is an intersite interaction between the bosons . here",

    "it is worth noting that near half - filling ( @xmath20 ) one might introduce the renormalization @xmath21 , or neutralizing background , that immediately provides the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the model of hard - core bose - gas with an intersite repulsion is equivalent to a system of spins @xmath22 exposed to an external magnetic field in the @xmath23-direction . for the system with neutralizing background we arrive at an effective pseudo - spin hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "in a linear approximation the hamiltonian for the coupling with an electromagnetic field reads as follows @xmath29_{z}-\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi _",
    "{ j}-\\phi _ { i})^{2}({\\hat { \\bf s}_{i}}\\cdot { \\hat { \\bf s}_{j}}));\\ ] ] @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the vector - potential , and integration runs over line binding the @xmath32 and @xmath33 sites ; @xmath34_{z}=\\frac{i}{2}(\\hat b_{i}^{\\dagger}\\hat b_{j}-\\hat b_{i}\\hat b_{j}^{\\dagger}),\\ ] ] however , the pseudo - spins are assumed to lie in @xmath35 plane .",
    "then the boson current density operator one may represent to be a sum of the paramagnetic @xmath36_{z},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and diamagnetic @xmath37 terms , respectively .      below we make use of a conventional two - sublattice mfa approach .",
    "for the description of the pseudospin ordering to be more physically clear one may introduce two vectors , the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ones : @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "for the plane where these vectors lie one may introduce two - parametric angular description : @xmath40 . the hard - core boson system in a two - sublattice approximation",
    "is described by two diagonal order parameters @xmath41 and two complex off - diagonal order parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the complex superfluid order parameter @xmath44 is determined by the in - plane components of ferromagnetic vector : @xmath45 , @xmath46 being the length of the in - plane component of ferromagnetic vector .",
    "so , for a local condensate density we get @xmath47 .",
    "it is of interest to note that in fact all the conventional uniform @xmath48 states with nonzero @xmath49 imply simultaneous long - range order both for modulus @xmath50 and phase @xmath51 .",
    "the in - plane components of antiferromagnetic vector @xmath52 describe a staggered off - diagonal order .",
    "it is worth noting that by default one usually considers the negative sign of the transfer integral @xmath12 , that implies the ferromagnetic in - plane pseudospin ordering .",
    "the model exhibits many fascinating quantum phases and phase transitions .",
    "early investigations predict at @xmath48 charge order ( co ) , bose superfluid ( bs ) and mixed ( co+bs ) supersolid uniform phases with an ising - type melting transition ( co - no ) and kosterlitz - thouless - type ( bs - no ) phase transitions to a non - ordered normal fluid ( no).@xcite the detailed mean - field and spin - wave analysis of the uniform phases of 2d hc - bh model is given by pich and frey.@xcite mfa yields for the conventional uniform supersolid phase @xcite @xmath53 with a constant chemical potential @xmath54 .",
    "it should be noted that the supersolid phase appears to be unstable with regard to small perturbations in the hamiltonian .",
    "the mean - field energy per site of the uniform supersolid phase is written as follows : @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the cost of doping both for co and co+bs phase appears to be rather high as compared with an easy - plane bs phase at half - filling where the chemical potential turns into zero.@xcite",
    "magnetic analogy allows us to make unambiguous predictions as regards the doping of bh system away from half - filling .",
    "indeed , the boson / hole doping of checkerboard co phase corresponds to the magnetization of an antiferromagnet in @xmath23-direction . in the uniform easy - axis @xmath57-phase of anisotropic antiferromagnet",
    "the local spin - flip energy cost is rather big . in other words ,",
    "the energy cost for boson / hole doping into checkerboard co phase appears to be big due to a large contribution of boson - boson repulsion .",
    "however , the magnetization of the anisotropic antiferromagnet in an easy axis direction may proceed as a first order phase transition with a `` topological phase separation '' due to the existence of antiphase domains.@xcite the antiphase domain walls provide the natural nucleation centers for a spin - flop phase having enhanced magnetic susceptibility as compared with small if any longitudinal susceptibility thus providing the advantage of the field energy .",
    "namely domain walls would specify the inhomogeneous magnetization pattern for such an anisotropic easy - axis antiferromagnet in relatively weak external magnetic field . as concerns the domain type in quasi - two - dimensional antiferromagnet",
    "one should emphasize the specific role played by the cylindrical , or bubble domains which have finite energy and size .",
    "these topological solitons have the vortex - like in - plane spin structure and often named `` skyrmions '' .",
    "the classical , or belavin - polyakov ( bp ) skyrmion @xcite describes the solutions of a non - linear @xmath58-model with a classical isotropic 2d heisenberg hamiltonian and represents one of the generic toy model spin textures .",
    "it is of primary importance to note that skyrmion - like bubble domains in easy - axis layered antiferromagnets were actually observed in the experiments performed by waldner,@xcite that were supported later by different authors ( see , e.g. refs . ) .",
    "although some questions were not completely clarified and remain open until now , @xcite the classical and quantum @xcite skyrmion - like topological defects are believed to be a genuine element of essential physics both of ferro- and antiferromagnetic 2d easy - axis systems .",
    "the magnetic analogy seems to be a little bit naive , however , it catches the essential physics of doping the hc - bh system .",
    "as regards the checkerboard co phase of such a system , namely a finite energy skyrmion - like bubble domain @xcite seems to be the most preferable candidate for the domain with antiphase domain wall providing the natural reservoir for extra bosons .",
    "the classical description of nonlinear excitations in hc - bh model includes the skyrmionic solution given @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite the skyrmion spin texture consists of a vortex - like arrangement of the in - plane components of ferromagnetic @xmath60 vector with the @xmath57-component reversed in the centre of the skyrmion and gradually increasing to match the homogeneous background at infinity .",
    "the simplest spin distribution within classical skyrmion is given as follows @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a global phase ( @xmath64 order parameter ) , @xmath65 skyrmion radius .",
    "the skyrmion spin texture describes the coexistence and competition of the staggered charge order parameter @xmath57 and bs order parameter @xmath46 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) that reflects a complex spatial interplay of potential and kinetic energies .    ;",
    "b ) the radial distribution of the modulus of the superfluid order parameter @xmath66 ; c ) the radial distribution of the charge density @xmath67 for the charged skyrmion ; d ) the orientation of the superfluid order parameter @xmath66 given two values of the phase order parameter @xmath68 : @xmath69 , respectively . rings in all the pictures correspond to the skyrmion ( bubble domain ) wall , the dashed circle being its center.,width=321 ]    the skyrmion looks like a bubble domain in an easy - axis magnet . it should be noted that the domain wall in such a bubble domain somehow created in the checkerboard co phase of 2d hc - bh system represents an effective ring - shaped reservoir both for bose - superfluid and extra boson / hole . indeed , the soliton energy depends quadratically on the number @xmath70 of bosons bound in domain wall,@xcite similarly to that of homogeneous bs phase.@xcite in other words , one might say about a zero value of the effective boson / hole chemical potential for the co bubble domain configuration , provided it were a ground state .",
    "the numerical calculations performed in frames of a classical continuous model @xcite show that the doped bosons appear to be trapped inside the bubble domain wall .",
    "the spatial distribution of the doped boson / hole density ( @xmath71 ) in the charged skyrmion is shown schematically in fig .",
    "skyrmions are characterized by the magnitude and sign of its topological charge , by its size ( radius ) , and by the global orientation of the spin .",
    "the scale invariance of classical bp skyrmionic solution reflects in that its energy does not depend on radius , and global phase .",
    "an interesting example of topological inhomogeneity is provided by a multi - center bp skyrmion @xcite which energy does not depend on the position of the centers .",
    "the latter are believed to be addressed as an additional degree of freedom , or positional order parameter .    in the continuous model",
    "the classical bp skyrmion is a topological excitation and can not dissipate .",
    "however , the classical static skyrmion is unstable with regard to an external field or anisotropic interactions both of easy - plane and easy - axis type .",
    "small easy - axis anisotropy or external field are sufficient to shrink skyrmion to a nanoscopic size when magnetic length @xmath72 : @xmath73 is of the order of several lattice parameters , and the continuous approximation fails to correctly describe excitations .",
    "nonetheless , abanov and pokrovsky @xcite have shown that the easy - axis anisotropy together with fourth - order exchange term can stabilize skyrmion with radius @xmath74      a skyrmionic scenario in hc - bh model allows us to make several important predictions .",
    "away from half - filling one may anticipate the nucleation of a topological defect in the unconventional form of the multi - center skyrmion - like object with ring - shaped bose superfluid regions positioned in an antiphase domain wall separating the co core and co outside of the single skyrmion .",
    "the specific spatial separation of bs and co order parameters that avoid each other reflects the competition of kinetic and potential energy .",
    "such a _ topological _ ( co+bs ) _ phase separation _ is believed to provide a minimization of the total energy as compared with its uniform supersolid counterpart .",
    "thus , the parent checkerboard co phase may gradually lose its stability under boson / hole doping , while a novel topological self - organized texture is believed to become stable .",
    "the most probable possibility is that every domain wall accumulates single boson , or boson hole .",
    "then , the number of centers in a multi - center skyrmion nucleated with doping has to be equal to the number of bosons / holes .",
    "in such a case , we anticipate the near - linear dependence of the total bs volume fraction on the doping . generally speaking",
    ", one may assume scenario when the nucleation of a multi - center skyrmion occurs spontaneously with no doping .",
    "in such a case we should anticipate the existence of neutral multi - center skyrmion - like object with equal number of positively and negatively charged single skyrmions .",
    "however , in practice , namely the boson / hole doping is likely to be a physically clear driving force for a nucleation of a single , or multi - center skyrmion - like self - organized collective mode in the form of multi - center charged topological defect which may be ( not strictly correctly ) referred to as multi - skyrmion system akin in a quantum hall ferromagnetic state of a two - dimensional electron gas.@xcite in such a case , we may characterize an individual skyrmion by its position ( i.e. , the center of skyrmionic texture ) , its size ( i.e. , the radius of domain wall ) , and the orientation of the in - plane components of pseudo - spin ( u(1 ) degree of freedom ) .",
    "an isolated skyrmion is described by the inhomogeneous distribution of the co parameter , or staggered boson density @xmath57 , order parameter @xmath75 characterizing the deviation from the half - filling , and @xmath46 that corresponds only to the modulus of the superfluid order parameter .",
    "it seems likely that for a light doping any doped particle ( boson / holes ) results in a nucleation of a new single - skyrmion state , hence its density changes gradually with particle doping .",
    "therefore , as long as the separation between skyrmionic centers is sufficiently large so that the inter - skyrmion interaction is negligible , the energy of the system per particle remains almost constant .",
    "this means that the chemical potential of a boson or hole remains unchanged with doping and hence apparently remains fixed .",
    "the multi - skyrmionic system in contrast with uniform ones can form the structures with inhomogeneous long - range ordering of the modulus of the superfluid order parameter accompanied by the non - ordered global phases of single skyrmions .",
    "such a situation resembles in part that of granular superconductivity .    in the long - wavelength limit",
    "the off - diagonal ordering can be described by an effective hamiltonian in terms of u(1 ) ( phase ) degree of freedom associated with each skyrmion .",
    "such a hamiltonian contains a repulsive , long - range coulomb part and a short - range contribution related to the phase degree of freedom .",
    "the latter term can be written out in the standard for the @xmath76 model form of a so - called josephson coupling @xmath77 where @xmath78 are global phases for skyrmions centered at points @xmath79 , respectively , @xmath80 josephson coupling parameter . namely the josephson coupling gives rise to the long - range ordering of the phase of the superfluid order parameter in a multi - center skyrmion .",
    "such a hamiltonian represents a starting point for the analysis of disordered superconductors , granular superconductivity , insulator - superconductor transition with @xmath81 array of superconducting islands with phases @xmath82 . calculating the phase - dependent part of skyrmion - skyrmion interaction timm _",
    "et al._@xcite arrived at @xmath83 sign of @xmath80 that favors antiparallel alignment of the u(1 ) pseudospins .",
    "in other words , two skyrmions are believed to form a peculiar josephson @xmath84 micro - junction .",
    "there are a number of interesting implications that follow directly from this result:@xcite the spontaneous breaking of time - reversal symmetry with non - zero supercurrents and magnetic fluxes in the ground state , long - time tails in the dynamics of the system , unconventional aharonov - bohm period @xmath85 , negative magnetoresistence .    to account for coulomb interaction and allow for quantum corrections we should introduce into effective hamiltonian the charging energy @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a boson number operator for bosons bound in @xmath32-th skyrmion ; it is quantum - mechanically conjugated to @xmath51 : @xmath88 , @xmath89 stands for the capacitance matrix , @xmath90 for bosonic charge .",
    "the classical ground state energy of skyrmion lattice for all reasonable two - dimensional lattice structures was minimized by timm _",
    "_ taking the u(1 ) order into account .",
    "@xcite besides the expected triangular lattice with frustrated antiferromagnetic u(1 ) order and square lattice with nel u(1 ) order the authors have also obtained ground - state energies for all 2d bravais lattices .",
    "such a system appears to reveal a tremendously rich quantum - critical structure . in the absence of disorder ,",
    "the @xmath48 phase diagram of the multi - skyrmion system implies either triangular , or square crystalline arrangements ( skyrmion , or bubble crystal ) with possible melting transition to a skyrmion ( bubble ) liquid .",
    "the melting of skyrmion lattice is successfully described applying the berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) theory to dislocations and disclinations of the lattice and proceeds in two steps .",
    "the first implies the transition to a liquid - crystal phase with short - range translational order , the second does the transition to isotropic liquid .",
    "disorder pins the skyrmion lattice and also causes the crystalline order to have a finite correlation length .",
    "for such a system provided the skyrmion positions fixed at all temperatures , the long - wave - length physics would be described by an @xmath76 model with expectable bkt transition and gapless @xmath76 spin - wave mode .",
    "the classical phase diagram of skyrmion lattice is quite rich .",
    "depending on the relation between coulomb and josephson coupling , and density one may arrive at different lattice structures with continuous or first order phase transitions . as regards the superfluid properties the skyrmionic system reveals unconventional behavior with two critical temperatures @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 being the temperature of the ordering of the modulus and @xmath94 that of the phase of order parameter @xmath95 .",
    "the low temperature physics in skyrmion crystals is governed by an interplay of two bkt transitions , for the u(1 ) phase and positional degrees of freedom , respectively .",
    "@xcite dislocations in most skyrmion lattice types lead to a mismatch in the u(1 ) degree of freedom , which makes the dislocations bind fractional vortices and lead to a coupling of translational and phase excitations .",
    "both bkt temperatures either coincide ( square lattice ) or the melting one is higher ( triangular lattice).@xcite quantum fluctuations can substantially affect these results .",
    "quantum melting can destroy u(1 ) order at sufficiently low densities where the josephson coupling becomes exponentially small .",
    "similar situation is expected to take place in the vicinity of structural transitions in skyrmion crystal . with increasing the skyrmion density",
    "the quantum effects result in a significant lowering of the melting temperature as compared with classical square - root dependence .",
    "the resulting melting temperature can reveal an oscilating behavior as a function of particle density with zeros at the critical ( magic ) densities associated with structural phase transitions .    in terms of our model",
    ", the positional order corresponds to an incommensurate charge density wave , while the u(1 ) order does to a superconductivity . in other words , we arrive at a subtle interplay between two orders .",
    "the superconducting state evolves from a charge order with @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the temperature of a melting transition which could be termed as a temperature of the opening of the insulating gap ( pseudo - gap ! ? ) .",
    "the normal modes of a dilute skyrmion system ( multi - center skyrmion ) include the pseudo - spin waves propagating in - between the skyrmions , the positional fluctuations , or phonon modes of the skyrmions which are gapless in a pure system , but gapped when the lattice is pinned , and , finally , fluctuations in the skyrmionic in - plane orientation and size .",
    "the latter two types of fluctuation are intimitely connected , since the @xmath23-component of spin and orientation are conjugate coordinates because of commutation relations of quantum angular momentum operators .",
    "so , rotating a skyrmion changes its size .",
    "the orientational fluctuations of the multi - skyrmion system are governed by the gapless @xmath76 model.@xcite the relevant model description is most familiar as an effective theory of the josephson junction array .",

    "i.e. _ , the disclinations .",
    "one should note that the liquids do not support transverse modes , these could survive in a liquid state only as overdamped modes . so that it is reasonable to assume that solidification of the skyrmion lattice would be accompanied by a stabilization of transverse modes with its sharpening below melting transition .",
    "in other words an instability of transverse phonon modes signals the onset of melting .",
    "a generic property of the positionally ordered skyrmion configuration is the sliding mode which is usually pinned by the disorder .",

    "such a system can be characterized by a dynamical short - range diagonal and off - diagonal ordering with a wide distribution of respective correlation lengths and relaxation rates .",
    "interestingly , that in frames of a continuous model this phase is still described to be a strongly correlated multi - center topological defect .",

    ". moreover , quantum melting effect may strongly affect the phase diagram near the `` magic '' doping level , where the skyrmion lattice undergoes the structural phase transition . for illustration , in the right hand side panel in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present the possible phase diagram for a hc - bh system with a quantum melting effect near the `` magic '' doping level @xmath119 . in all the cases , the critical doping level for the superfluid formation is determined by the magnitude of the josephson coupling constant .",

    "our interpretation of the phase transition at @xmath120 differs from that in ref .. this temperature is governed by the magnitude of transfer integral , and believed to be a temperature of the emergence of the nonzero magnitude of the modulus of the superconducting order parameter rather than a critical temperature for an insulator to superconductor transition as it is stated in ref .. this conclusion seems to be a result of finite size effects and boundary conditions in qmc calculations despite the authors make use of the most efficient qmc strategy .",
    "such problems seem to be typical for a finite - size simulation of many phase transitions .",
    "in addition , we should note that mc calculations need substantial increase in lattice size to reproduce quantitatively the long - wavelength physics because the size of skyrmion and skyrmion lattice parameter appear to be new characteristic lengths .",
    "the close inspection of the phase diagram in fig.[fig3 ] , where @xmath121 , does not provide the optimistic expectations as regards the high - temperature superconductivity in 2d hc - bh systems , even if the magnitude of the local boson transfer integral were as large as @xmath122 k. nevertheless , the attractively large temperatures @xmath120 of the topological phase separation with the emergence of nonzero local condensate density engender different reasonable speculations as regards its practical realization .",

    "the very notion of topological excitation seems to be inconsistent . at the same time , the discreteness of the lattice itself does not prohibit from considering the nanoscale ( pseudo)spin textures whose topology and spin arrangement is that of a skyrmion.@xcite naturally , the typical continuous models fail to describe properly such short - wave length nanoscopic inhomogeneities .",
    "hereafter , we discuss a simple model which seems to catch the main effects of discreteness and quantization .      what is the lattice counterpart of the small skyrmion - like bubble domain",
    "?        fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] presents the schematic view of such a smallest skyrmion - like bubble domain in a checkerboard co phase for 2d square lattice with an effective size of 4 lattice spacings .",
    "the domain wall is believed to include as a minimum eight sites forming a ring - shaped system of four dimers each composed of two sites .",
    "there are two types of such domains which differ by a rotation by @xmath123 .",
    "the formation of such a center seems not to require a big energy .",
    "indeed , the simple estimate of a change in potential energy : @xmath124 points to a near cancelation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 contributions . the remarkable feature of the domain is in a rather small magnitude both of scalar potential and electric field inside the 8-site domain wall ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the flip - energy for the dimer dipole moment is estimated to be @xmath125 , compared with that for bare checkerboard co phase ( @xmath126 ) that implies rather subtle competition between @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings .",
    "however , the difference @xmath127 is believed to be always positive and large . in other words , the flip - energy for",
    "the dimer dipole may be relatively small .",
    "respective dipole fluctuations would result in an effective screening of electrostatic repulsion energy thus providing a stabilization of a bubble - like defect .",
    "an important additional mechanism of the domain stabilization in the hc - bh systems with local bosons composed from electron pairs may arise from the electron and lattice polarization effects.@xcite as is well known , the respective energies are comparable in value with the intersite coulomb interaction . probably , namely both these effects might strongly contribute to the domain stabilization energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the bubble geometry implies the formation of the electrostatic potential well inside the domain wall both for positive and negative charges .",
    "it means that the doping into a domain wall stabilizes the domain configuration .",
    "such a doping maybe energy costless , while the energy cost of the pseudo - spin - flip in a checkerboard co phase is rather high : @xmath128 , if the neutralizing background is taken into account .      with taking into account the kinetic energy ( quantum tunneling ) only inside the 8-site domain wall we shall consider it as a quantum system in an external electrostatic potential field assuming a rigid checkerboard co ordering overall beyond the domain wall .",
    "further , taking into account the reasonable relation : @xmath129 , we shall consider the domain wall to be a system of four dimers , or pairs of nearest neighboring sites forming a quantum cluster .",
    "transfer integral .",
    "the arrows mark the dipole - allowed transitions ( see text for details).,width=321 ]    we anticipate the model though being simplified would be very instructive analyzing the role played both by quantum and discreteness effects .",
    "let first address a simple two - site , or a dimer system .",
    "the effective pseudo - spin - hamiltonian for such a cluster , or a single dimer hamiltonian can be written as follows @xmath130\\,+d { \\hat s}_{z}^2\\ ,",
    "-\\,h_s\\,{\\hat s}_{z}-\\,h_t\\,{\\hat t}_{z } , \\label{h}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is the total pseudo - spin momentum , @xmath132 is an operator that changes pseudo - spin multiplicity , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "the first two terms in this effective pseudo - spin hamiltonian describe the intra - dimer interactions , while the last two ones describe its coupling with the off - domain - wall surroundings .",
    "it is worth noting that the condition @xmath134 means that the effective magnetic field produced by this surroundings turns into zero that provides the particle - hole symmetry of the dimer physics , in particular , for the domain wall doping .",
    "actually , we arrive at an effective singlet - triplet model.@xcite both @xmath136 and @xmath137 operators have a rather simple physical sense : the former corresponds to the total `` quantum '' charge of the dimer , while the latter does to the total `` quantum '' dipole moment . strictly speaking , the diagonal order parameters @xmath138 and @xmath139 describe the charge and dipole density , while the off - diagonal order parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 describe the corresponding phase ordering .",
    "it is of primary importance to note that these order parameters are not independent because the respective operators obey the kinematic constraint : @xmath142 stemmed from a simple spin algebra .",
    "it should be noted that there are two operators : @xmath143 and @xmath144 $ ] that change the pseudo - spin multiplicity with their matrices being symmetric and antisymmetric , respectively : @xmath145 @xmath146 the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) points to the competition of s- and t - orders in the ring - shaped domain wall .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] shows a step - by - step formation of the energy spectrum of such a two - site cluster , or dimer .",
    "the arrows mark the dipole - allowed transitions that could be revealed in optical spectra .",
    "the tunnel states @xmath147 and @xmath148 describing purely `` half - filled '' dimer states are mixed due to the electric field with the mixing level governed by the ratio @xmath149 .",
    "if @xmath150 , we arrive at classical nel - like `` up - and - down '' dimer state .",
    "hereafter , to describe our singlet - triplet quantum pseudo - spin system we start with trial functions @xmath151 where the spin functions @xmath152 in cartesian basis are used : @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the conventional spin operator is represented on this basis by a simple matrix : @xmath155 and for the order parameters one easily obtains : @xmath156 , \\langle\\{\\hat{s}_i\\hat{s}_j\\}\\rangle=2(\\delta_{ij}-a_ia_j - b_ib_j ) \\label{med}\\ ] ] given the normalization constraint @xmath157 .",
    "thus , for the case of spin-1 system the order parameters are determined by two classical vectors ( two real components of one complex vector @xmath158 from ( [ wf1 ] ) ) .",
    "the two vectors are coupled , so the minimal number of dynamic variables describing the @xmath159 spin system appears to be equal to four .        for the dimer as the singlet - triplet center",
    "we have additional unconventional t , j - order parameters . for the respective averages we can easily obtain @xmath160",
    "given the real value of @xmath161 parameter we arrive at a simple form:@xmath162 , and @xmath163 .",
    "now we may proceed with the inter - dimer coupling in the domain wall . introducing the symmetrized superpositions of s and t vectors , we can write the pseudo - spin hamiltonian of the inter - dimer interaction as follows @xmath164 @xmath165 + \\frac{1}{2}(v_{nnn}-t_{nnn})[s_{z}^{2}(a_{1g})- s_{z}^{2}(b_{1 g } ) + \\ ] ] @xmath166,\\ ] ] where @xmath167 @xmath168 @xmath169 @xmath170 @xmath171 @xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174 ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath175 for the system of four dimers in a domain wall is determined now by the condition : @xmath176 for undoped and singly - doped ( boson / hole ) domain wall , respectively .",
    "the respective mean values we can address to be order parameters that describe the subtle structure of a domain wall : as regards the diagonal order @xmath177 specifies the full charge ; @xmath178 and @xmath179 do the electric dipole moments , @xmath180 the component of the quadrupole momentum , and one might introduce the higher order multipole moments . as regards the off - diagonal order we should , in general , proceed with the three types ( @xmath181 , or @xmath182 ) of the s - order , and three types ( @xmath183 , or @xmath184 ) of the t - order , which can be defined as follows : @xmath185 noteworthy to mention the kinematic constraint that couples different order parameters . in the absense of an external magnetic field the energy",
    "does not depend on @xmath186 vector , it is restricted only to lie in @xmath35-plane . in other words , we deal with the uncertainty of j - order parameter .",
    "the mean - field domain - wall ground state corresponds to the coexistent @xmath187 modes given the negative sign of the transfer integral @xmath188 or @xmath189 modes given the positive sign of the transfer integral @xmath188 .",
    "the relation between s- and t - mode weight is specified by the relationship between the @xmath0 transfer integral @xmath190 and electric field @xmath191 .",
    "if we assume @xmath192 , then given @xmath193 the dimers have purely @xmath159 ground state , and we arrive at s - type off - diagonal order . in contrast , given @xmath194 we arrive at t - type off - diagonal order . in general , neglecting the st - mixing term leads to two independent phase order parameters . generally speaking , the interference dipole - dipole st - term would result in st - mixing accompanied by the constraint on the phase order parameters with an appearance of a noncollinearity effect .",
    "thus we arrive at the conclusion that the symmetry of the order parameter distribution in the domain wall would be specified only by the sign of the transfer integral .",
    "in addition , we see that the problem of the order parameter associated with our bubble domain is much more complicated than in conventional bcs - like approach @xcite due to its multicomponent nature .",
    "moreover , we deal with a system with different symmetry of low - lying excited states and competing order parameters that implies their possible ambiguous manifestation in either properties .",
    "the low - symmetry crystalline electric fields or crystal distortions would result in a mixing of the order parameters with different symmetry .",
    "the bubble domain ( fig.[fig4 ] ) yields a simple and instructive toy model to describe such effects .",
    "it is worth noting that the flux quantization effects for the bubble domain , in particular , the localizing effect of the magnetic field on the moving bosons , are expected to be observed only for rather large fields . indeed",
    ", nanoscopic atomic systems such as a square plaquette with a size of around 10 @xmath195 require a field of @xmath196 tesla for a half flux quantum per plaquette .    above we have concerned a simple one - center topological defect .",
    "however , in general one has to make use of more complicated topological excitation like a multi - center bp skyrmion.@xcite the question arises , whether such an entity may be described as a system of weakly coupled individual one - center defects ? in practice , it seems to be a rather reasonable approach only for slight deviation from half - filling , when the mean separation between doped particles is much larger than the effective domain size .",
    "the bubble domain may be addressed to be well isolated only if its environment does not contain another domain(s ) which could be involved to a `` dangerous '' nearest - neighbor inter - dimer coupling .",
    "each domain in fig.[fig4 ] has @xmath197 of such neighbors .",
    "hence the concentration of well isolated domains can be written as follows : @xmath198 where @xmath23 is a number of `` dangerous '' neighbors , @xmath199 the boson concentration .",
    "the @xmath200 maximum is reached at @xmath201 . in our case @xmath202 , or @xmath203 . with increasing doping the deviation of @xmath200 from the linear law rises . on the other hand , knowing the effective domain area @xmath204 we can roughly estimate the limiting concentration of the single - domain model description to be @xmath205 , @xmath206 .",
    "the inter - domain coupling includes both long - range ss- and short - range tt - terms .",
    "we should emphasize a strong anisotropy of this coupling .",
    "for nearest neighbors along [ 1,0 ] and [ 0,1 ] directions namely the short - range ( dipole - dipole ) tt - coupling would result in an effective suppression of the main s ordering ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) , in contrast with [ 11 ] direction .",
    "thus we may conclude that the above mentioned simple continuous model for josephson junction arrays should be strongly modified to describe the multi - domain configurations in 2d quantum hc - bh lattices , both as regards the subtle internal domain structure , the competition of different order parameter , and the anisotropy of josephson coupling .",
    "in conclusion , the boson / hole doping of the hard - core boson system away from half - filling is assumed to be a driving force for a nucleation of a multi - center skyrmion - like self - organized collective mode that resembles a system of co bubble domains with a bose superfluid and extra bosons both confined in domain walls .",
    "such a _ topological _ co+bs _ phase separation _ , rather than an uniform mixed co+bs supersolid phase , is believed to describe the evolution of hc - bh model away from half - filling .",
    "starting from the classical model we predict the properties of the respective quantum system . in frames of our scenario",
    "we may anticipate for the hc - bh model the emergence of an inhomogeneous bs condensate for superhigh temperatures @xmath207 , and 3d superconductivity for rather high temperatures @xmath208 .",
    "the system is believed to reveal many properties typical for granular superconductors , cdw materials , wigner crystals , and multi - skyrmion system akin in a quantum hall ferromagnetic state of a 2d electron gas .",
    "topological inhomogeneity is believed to be a generic property of 2d hard - core boson systems away from half - filling .",
    "such a behavior represents a boson counterpart of the so - called _ topological doping _ being a general feature of mott - insulator or 2d fermion hubbard model.@xcite    despite all shortcomings , mfa and continuous approximation are expected to provide a physically clear semiquantitative picture of rather complex transformations taking place in bare co system with doping , and can be instructive as a starting point to analyze possible scenarios .",
    "first of all , the mfa analysis allow us to consider the antiphase domain wall in co phase to be a very efficient ring - shaped potential well for the localization of a single extra boson ( hole ) thus forming a novel type of a topological defect with a single - charged domain wall .",
    "such a defect can be addressed as a charged skyrmion - like quasiparticle which energy can be approximated by its classical value for co bubble domain .",
    "it is of great importance to note that domain wall simultaneously represents a ring - shaped reservoir for bose superfluid .",
    "unfortunately , we have no experience to deal with multi - center skyrmions as regards its structure , energetics , and stability .",
    "it should be noted that such a texture with strongly polarizable centers is believed to provide an effective screening of long - range boson - boson repulsion thus resulting in an additional self - stabilization .",
    "nucleation of topological phase is likely to proceed in the way typical for the first order phase transitions .",
    "the role played by quantum effects and lattice discreteness has been illustrated in frames of the simplest nanoscopic counterpart of the bubble domain in a checkerboard co phase of 2d hc - bh square lattice .",
    "it is shown that the relative magnitude and symmetry of multi - component order parameter are mainly determined by the sign of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transfer integrals .",
    "the topologically inhomogeneous phase of the hc - bh system away from the half - filling can exhibit the signatures both of @xmath2 , and @xmath3 symmetry of the off - diagonal order .",
    "the model allows us to study the subtle microscopic details of the order parameter distribution including its symmetry in a real rather than momentum space , though the problem of the structure and stability of nanoscale domain configurations remains to be solved .",
    "the present paper establishes only the framework for analyzing the subtleties of the phase separation in a lattice hc - bh model away from half - filling .",
    "much work remains to be done both in a macroscopic and microscopic approaches .",
