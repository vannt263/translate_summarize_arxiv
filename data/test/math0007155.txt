    "since the first references on fractional - order derivatives in the 17-th century , the theory of fractional - order derivatives and integrals was highly developed by many mathematicians . in the last five decades , many authors made a great effort to apply this knowledge in practice .",
    "but only in the last decade can we find some significant works concerned with the description , analysis , and synthesis of fractional - order regulated systems .",
    "real objects are generally fractional - order , however , for many of them the fractionality is very low . but",
    "the control systems used so far were all considered as integer - order systems , regardless of the reality . because of the higher complexity and the absence of adequate mathematical tools , fractional - order dynamical systems were only treated marginally in the theory and practice of control systems , e.g. @xcite . in these",
    "works the first generalizations of analysis methods for fractional - order control systems were made ( @xmath1-plane , frequency response , etc . ) .    at that time",
    "our research in this field began .",
    "on the basis of fundamental works @xcite we made at first an analysis of the fractional dimension of the controlled systems and properties of fractional regulators @xcite .",
    "until then we did not make difference between the terms fractal and fractional regulator .",
    "very significant theoretical works appeared in 1993 and later @xcite .",
    "this and the following results in this field were summarized in book @xcite . the fundamentals for practical utilization of numerical methods",
    "@xcite , based on the relation for approximation of the fractional derivatives @xcite , and analytical methods @xcite for fractional - order systems simulation were made .",
    "but the proposed iterative numerical methods did not converge to the correct solution .",
    "the first explicit noniterative numerical methods for simulation  of  fractional - order  systems  were presented in works @xcite . in works",
    "@xcite the first comparison was made of these noniterative numerical methods and corresponded analytical methods derived for fractional - order control system from analytical solutions published in @xcite .",
    "an example of experimental design of a fractional - order @xmath0 controller , with comparison of dynamic properties in fractional- and integer - order system with a fractional- and integer - order controller , designed for an integer - order system as the best approximation to given fractional - order system , was presented in works @xcite too .",
    "it followed from these results , that an application of integer - order regulator to fractional - order system is inadequate and with a change of system or regulator parameters can lead to system instability .",
    "this example was taken to many other works @xcite etc .",
    "after experimental method of the fractional - order system parameters identification @xcite , two exact methods @xcite were derived .",
    "a great effort was devoted to elaboration of methods of fractional - order controllers synthesis . from purely experimental methods",
    "@xcite we continued with methods based on minimization of regulated square @xcite etc . , and methods based on stability and damping measure @xcite etc .",
    "in these works the fundamentals of fractional - order @xmath2 controllers synthesis are developed and now first works appear with application of these methods to the control of chaotic fractional - order systems @xcite .",
    "the development of the methods described in works @xcite required the elaboration of methods of fractional - order system analysis in the frequency domain @xcite etc .",
    "the following bode analysis was utilized for the fractional - order controllers synthesis and such regulated control systems stability analysis .",
    "this contribution is a continuation of the previous works and deals with the mathematical description and analysis of fractional - order regulated systems in the state space .",
    "we present results of simulations of a fractional - order system with the aim to investigate the stability of such system .",
    "for the definition of the control system we consider a simple unity feed - back control system illustrated in fig.1 , where @xmath3 denotes the transfer function of the controlled system and @xmath4 is the controller transfer function , both integer- or fractional - order .",

    "@xcite was presented a state space model that expresses the fractional - order derivatives @xmath17 this description is convenient for simple models of systems @xcite with only one fractional - order derivation . in this contribution we propose state space model of the linear time invariant one dimensional system which expresses the first derivatives in the state space equations ( [ r3 ] ) and which has the classical state space interpretation for the fractional - order system too . on the right side of these equations",
    "we can then transfer more than one fractional - order derivatives of the state space variables ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "a disadvantage of this expression is that we can not describe the state space equations in vector and matrix relations as in previous description ( [ r2 ] ) .",

    "the order of the integer - order system  in  the  state  space model  was equivalent to the number of the state variables .",
    "in fractional - order  sys- tems it does not hold .",
    "we propose to consider the order of the fractional - order systems according to the order of the highest derivative ( integer- or fractional - order ) in the resulting differential equation , e.g. ( [ r1 ] ) .    under condition @xmath24",
    "we can obtain from state space model ( [ r4 ] ) the two equations of statics  of  this system , which are not algebraic equations as in integer - order linear systems , but differential equations , from which we can compute the coordinates of the equilibrium point , to which the state trajectories ( [ r4 ] ) tend .",
    "after discretisation of the first derivative by first differentiation in ( [ r4 ] ) we obtained the simple euler methods for solving the state space model . for the fractional - order derivatives in ( [ r4 ] )",
    "we can take the relation from e.g. @xcite . in fig.2 and fig.3",
    "is a comparison of the unit - step response of the classical numerical solution @xcite and the numerical solution of the state space model .",
    "the obtained state trajectories represent stable focal point for the above mentioned coefficients of the system ( with stability measure @xmath25 and damping measure @xmath26 , e.g. @xcite ) and unstable focal point for only one changed coefficient @xmath27 of the same system .",
