    "understanding the behavior of a particle diffusing in the presence of traps is important as it captures the essence of many physical processes , including diffusion controlled reactions where one of the reactants is immobile , trapping of excitons , etc .",
    "@xcite mapping of the diffusion problem with traps to the scalar elasticity problem also affords an insight into lattice vibration of systems such as binary alloys with contrasting elastic constants . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", this problem is analogous to the ideal chain in inhomogeneous media .",
    "the ideal chain problem is interesting as it is the gaussian limit of the self - avoiding walks and yet possesses a universality class of its own in inhomogeneous media , distinct from the usual random walk .",
    "these considerations resulted in many analytical and numerical attempts to gain understanding of the problem @xcite .",
    "typical quantities used to characterize diffusion in the presence of traps include @xmath0 , the probability that the diffusing particle returns to the starting point after time @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath0 is related to the number of distinct sites visited by the diffusing particle and is the laplace transform of the vibrational density of states of the corresponding scalar elasticity problem , which can often be measured experimentally by methods such as raman and neutron scattering @xcite .    for the case of diffusion in the presence of traps distributed randomly with no correlations",
    ", it has been proved rigorously by donsker and varadhan @xcite that the decay of @xmath0 with time is slower than exponential , indicating that , in the long time limit , the properties of the diffusing particle is dominated by the presence of large trap free regions which have a finite ( though small ) probability of occurence .",
    "this is because , if the traps were uniformly distributed , the diffusing particle would be trapped at a constant rate , which would result in an exponential decay of @xmath2 .",
    "it also means that the _ quenched _ disorder average must be carried out since an annealed averaging would smear out the trap positions .    in this paper",
    "we ask the question of whether and how this interesting behavior of the diffusing particle with traps is modified when we introduce long range correlations in their positions @xcite . in the equivalent scalar elasticity problem , the correlated traps map to the clamping of sites with a correlated distribution . in this sense",
    ", the present problem extends the so - called _ fractino _ problem @xcite where a fractal boundary of an otherwise nonfractal object is clamped to the case where the bulk of the substrate is itself a fractal .",
    "it is also an extension of the _ fracton _ problem @xcite as the traps ( or clamped boundaries ) are introduced into the scalar elasticity of fractals .",
    "calculational difficulties have prevented this problem from receiving its share of attention even though , often in real physical situations , the positions of traps are correlated at least within limited length scales . for the case of uncorrelated trap distribution , a poisson distribution",
    "is usually assumed , which simplifies the theoretical calculation @xcite ; however this assumption fails for correlated traps .",
    "as far as computational calculations , techniques based on exact enumeration are highly computer time and memory intensive because of the high sensitivity of the behavior of the diffusing particle to the actual positions of the traps in the sample , leading to large fluctuations in the measured quantity from sample to sample .",
    "this translates to requiring an ensemble average to be taken over a large number of disorder configurations for meaningful results .",
    "moreover the onset of the asymptotic regime is very slow in this type of problem , which adds to the computational difficulties @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we establish that @xmath2 has a stretched exponential form _",
    "qualitatively _ similar to the case of the poissonian trap distribution but with a substantially different stretch exponent .",
    "we show this behavior from the analysis of the density of eigenvalues of the transition probability matrix @xmath3 which describes the diffusion process .",
    "we also study the finite size scaling of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath3 , which serves as an extremely powerful tool to extract the stretch exponent characterizing the long time behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "a preliminary account of this work was presented at the hayashibara forum ( 1995 ) and appears in its proceedings .",
    "we choose percolation cluster @xcite formed at critical probability of occupation @xmath4 as the substrate for diffusion .",
    "the sites on the external perimeter ( hull ) @xcite as well as on the internal perimeter of the percolation cluster are made absorbing and once the diffusing particle reaches the perimeter sites it is trapped permanently .",
    "the hull sites and the sites constituting the internal perimeter form fractals at @xmath4 @xcite . thus placing the traps along the perimeters induces spatial correlations among the traps because of the long range correlations among the sites of a fractal .",
    "while we do not pursue the distinction of external versus internal perimeters in this work , there _ are _ interesting effects when different boundary conditions are applied to them , at least in two dimensions @xcite .    the time evolution of the probability @xmath5 that the diffusing particle is at site @xmath6 at time @xmath1 is markovian and the process can be described in the continious time limit by the following master equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hopping rate from site @xmath9 to @xmath6 . in this problem",
    "we consider only nearest neighbour hopping and so @xmath8 is non - zero only for the nearest neighbour pairs @xmath10 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath8 to be @xmath11 for all occupied nearest neighbours @xmath9 , where @xmath12 is the full coordination number of the underlying lattice ; otherwise @xmath8 is set equal to zero .",
    "what this amounts to is that once the particle hops to a trap site there is no further time evolution of that particular random walk and only those walks which have escaped getting trapped in the perimeter sites evolve further .",
    "thus the traps act as permanent particle absorbers .",
    "processes whose time evolution is governed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : markov ] ) can be cast into an eigenvalue problem of the transition probability matrix @xmath3 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath8 of @xmath3 control the dynamics of the random walk and the locations of the nonzero elements of @xmath3 have the information about the structure of the underlying fractal substrate responsible for the correlations among the trap sites on its perimeters .",
    "the density of normal modes of @xmath3 is related to the return to the starting point probability of the diffusing particle by the laplace transform @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution of the number of walks @xmath13 which return to their starting point after time @xmath1 , denoted as @xmath14 , was studied in @xcite and found to be a truncated log - normal distribution . thus @xmath15 in @xcite",
    "it was further found from the first moment of this distribution that @xmath16 in the asymptotic long time limit , where @xmath2 is obtained as @xmath17 , the bar above the quantity indicating the quenched disorder average .",
    "the exponent @xmath18 is the same one as that which appears in the long time behavior of the width of the log - normal distribution , @xmath19 , @xmath20    since @xmath2 has a stretched exponential behavior according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rtsp ] ) , we expect the density of normal modes @xmath21 ( which is the inverse laplace transform of @xmath2 ) to also have a stretched exponential form @xcite , @xmath22 in the limit of small @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the eigenvalues of @xmath3 , and the exponents @xmath25 and @xmath26 are related to each other by @xmath27 .",
    "the results from @xcite gave support for the presence of such a behavior although their numerical estimates of @xmath26 need to be improved as they did not take into account the proper normalization of @xmath21 as well as the substantial non - asymptotic effects @xcite .",
    "we can also relate the behavior of @xmath28 to the finite size effects of the edge of the spectrum .",
    "first , note that , for any finite substrate however large , the largest eigenvalue of @xmath3 , which we denote by @xmath29 , must be less than one .",
    "this is because the eigenvalue of one would indicate the existence of a stationary state whereas there are always particles which are trapped , leading to a _ leakage _ of probability for the diffusing particle in contrast to the diffusion _ without _ traps .",
    "the value of @xmath30 then corresponds to the slowest time scale of the problem , and there is always a gap between @xmath29 and one , the latter being what the maximum eigenvalue would be for diffusion without traps .",
    "the interesting question is whether this gap is bounded from below by a nonzero constant or it approaches zero as the substrate size increases .    our argument for the behavior @xmath31 as the substrate size @xmath32 follows the observation of @xcite for the case of uncorrelated trap distribution .",
    "in that case , the return probability @xmath2 was shown to be a stretched exponential which is slower than a pure exponential ( although not as slow as a power law which would be the case in the absence of traps ) , and this behavior was attributed to the dominance of the trap - free regions although they occur relatively infrequently . in our case of critically correlated trap distribution , we also have a slow , stretched exponential for @xmath2 which we interpret as a similar dominance of the nearly trap - free regions . although there are more traps in the critically correlated case , there are also much greater fluctuations in their density",
    ". thus regions of relatively low concentrations of the traps are likely to be present , probably with a hierachical size distribution .",
    "since the leakage of probability is _ nearly _ zero in a _ nearly _ trap free region , we would expect @xmath29 to approach one as the size of the largest trap free region grows indefinitely .",
    "another argument is as follows : if there were indeed a nonzero lower bound for @xmath33 , then it would also give a bound for the slowest relaxation rate .",
    "thus @xmath2 would have to decay at least exponentially in time corresponding to this rate .",
    "since @xmath2 in fact decays as a stretched exponential with the stretch exponent less than one ( @xcite as well as this work ) , no such bound can exist for the rate ; rather @xmath34 as @xmath32 .",
    "we further propose a scaling relation between @xmath35 and @xmath36 via @xmath37 where a possible numerical prefactor has been neglected .",
    "this relation follows from the assumption that , say , the largest ( @xmath29 ) and second largest ( @xmath38 ) eigenvalues scale relative to the value one in the same way when @xmath32 .",
    "that is , if we assume @xmath39 where @xmath40 , then the difference must also scale in the same way , @xmath41 but",
    "this latter integral must scale as @xmath42 if the integral of the density of normal modes @xmath43 is normalized to unity .",
    "this means @xmath44 , thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : eg ] ) follows .",
    "the assumption of the same asymptotic behavior for the two largest eigenvalues is plausible if we consider the difference between @xmath29 ( or @xmath38 ) and one to be the reflection of the finite size of the largest ( or the second largest ) trap free region ( respectively ) .",
    "as long as the large trap free regions are geometrically similar ( as would be the case in a hierarchical distribution of such regions ) , and as long as their sizes all go to infinity as @xmath32 , it seems reasonable that the gaps between @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) and one behave in the same manner .    if we substitute a stretched exponential form of @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eg ] ) we get an incomplete gamma function . on retaining only the leading term of the incomplete gamma function and taking natural log of both sides we get ,",
    "@xmath47 where a general stretched exponential form of @xmath43 @xmath48 has been assumed and @xmath49 .    while the above gives a particular scaling prediction for the case of the critically correlated trap distribution , the argument leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eg ] ) applies more generally .",
    "for example , a similar procedure should apply to the uncorrelated trap distribution of @xcite . also , for the trapless case ( or the _ ants _ @xcite ) , where the largest eigenvalue is actually one ( because there _ is _ a stationary state ) , a similar argument should work with , say , the second ( @xmath38 ) and third largest ( @xmath50 ) eigenvalues .",
    "of course , if there is no trap , a probability leakage , per se , does not occur .",
    "however , each mode with a large @xmath24 tends to be associated with a _",
    "blob _ of high connectivity region , to which the same kind of argument can be applied . indeed , in the trapless case , eq .  ( [ eq : eg ] ) together with the power law density of states @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the spectral dimension of the substrate , leads to a power law relation between @xmath36 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 which is identical to the relation proposed on the basis of the finite size scaling of the largest nontrivial normal mode and numerically verified in @xcite .",
    "such finite size scaling relations provide a very powerful technique to obtain the quantitative characterization of the density of states as they reduce the computational effort drastically , requiring only the information on the highest ( or second highest ) mode .",
    "in this section we give numerical results for the exponent @xmath55 for the stretched exponential decay of the density of states as discussed above .",
    "we extract this exponent directly from the density of states ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : spec ] ) ) and also independently from the finite size scaling of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : fs ] ) ) in two and three dimensions ( square and simple cubic lattice , respectively ) .    in order to reduce the computational time and memory requirements",
    ", we take advantage of the fact that we are interested only in the asymptotic long time relaxation of the system which is controlled by those normal modes with large eigenvalues @xmath24 .",
    "thus we use the arnoldi - saad algorithm @xcite to reduce the original @xmath3 into a smaller matrix which contains the approximate information about the highest normal modes .",
    "we analyze the density of states per site , @xmath43 .",
    "it is obtained from the eigenvalues of @xmath3 by binning them linearly in the @xmath56 space .",
    "the number of eigenvalues in each bin is divided by the bin width , the size of the cluster and also by the number of clusters over which the quenched disorder average is performed .",
    "the number of independent cluster realizations over which the disorder average was taken is of the order @xmath57 for cluster sizes @xmath58 @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 and of the order @xmath60 for @xmath58 @xmath62 .",
    "we retained in the final results only those bins which contained eigenvalues contributed from every substrate realization to avoid partial binning .    since @xmath43 has a stretched exponential decay we have plotted @xmath63 versus @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which is expected to have the form @xmath64 .",
    "there is an excellent data collapse for all the cluster sizes both in 2d and 3d .",
    "the solid curve drawn through the data is obtained by fitting the data to an expression of this form .",
    "the numerical estimates of @xmath55 and the numerical values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 corresponding to the central values of @xmath55 are tabulated in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "note that the value of @xmath55 can not be accurately obtained simply from the slope of the double log plot of @xmath67 with respect to @xmath56 as the value of the constant @xmath66 might be appreciable .",
    "the size of the symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is larger than the cluster to cluster statistical fluctuations .",
    "the quoted error bars are obtained visually from changing the effective estimate of @xmath55 for the nonlinear fit until it no longer fits the data points . the small scaling regime which is typical for these kinds of problems ( i.e. , diffusion with traps )",
    "@xcite makes the precise extraction of @xmath55 difficult .",
    "this accounts for the large error bars in our results as compared to the case of diffusion in a percolation cluster without absorbing sites @xcite .",
    "in the latter case the density of states has a power law form and the scaling regime increases appreciably with the size of the cluster , which resulted in much smaller error bars for the extracted exponents even with the same numerical technique .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot @xmath68 with respect to @xmath35 in 2d and 3d where @xmath36 is the size of the substrate .",
    "the solid curves are obtained by fitting the data to an expression @xmath69 , which is what we expect from the finite size scaling analysis of the largest eigenvalue .",
    "the size of the symbols are larger than the cluster to cluster fluctuations .",
    "the number of clusters over which the disorder average was performed is of the order 1000 for the larger clusters , same as for the density of states , and for smaller clusters of size @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath57 and @xmath62 the average was taken over @xmath60 clusters .",
    "the estimates of @xmath55 , and the values of @xmath65 , and @xmath72 corresponding to the central values of @xmath55 which we obtain from the nonlinear fit are tabulated in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the error bar for the value of @xmath55 is obtained in a similar way to that for the density of states .",
    "we note that the estimates of @xmath55 and @xmath65 obtained from the density of states and from the finite size scaling of the largest eigenvalue , given in table  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] , respectively , are in good agreement with each other .",
    "the values of @xmath26 thus obtained , however , turn out to be about a factor of two larger than the corresponding stretch exponents for the uncorrelated distribution of traps @xcite .",
    "the estimates of @xmath55 also differ from those of @xmath73 as given by @xcite due , we believe , primarily to the failure of @xciteto take proper account of @xmath56 being not quite in the asymptotic region ( thus proper normalization and prefactors becoming important ) ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the exponent @xmath25 ( eq .  ( [ eq : chi ] ) ) is relatively insensitive to @xmath55 ( @xmath74 ) and the analysis of @xmath2 in @xcite is not affected by these problems .",
    "we also believe that their main conclusions remain valid .",
    "in summary , we have studied the problem of diffusion on a substrate with permanent traps which are distributed with critical correlation in their positions .",
    "the critical correlation has been modeled by placing the traps on the perimeters of critical percolation clusters , which are obtained by monte carlo simulation .",
    "the statistical behavior of the diffusing particle in the time domain is then mapped to the scalar elasticity problem with fixed , fractal boundaries , and a numerical analysis of the vibrational density of states of the latter problem is carried out using an approximate diagonalization algorithm of arnoldi and saad @xcite .",
    "this problem may be considered a generalization both of the _ fracton _ problem of alexander and orbach @xcite , where there are no traps but the substrate is fractal , and of the _ fractino _ problem of sapoval et al @xcite where a fractal boundary is clamped ( equivalent to traps ) but the substrate itself is not fractal .",
    "we have shown that introducing critical spatial correlations among the traps does not change the _ qualitative _ behavior of the density of states as compared to the case of uncorrelated traps , but that there are substantial effects of correlations _",
    "quantitatively_. this strongly suggests that the diffusion process is dictated by the presence of nearly trapless regions similarly to the case of uncorrelated traps , but the long range correlations among the trap positions lead to a decrease in the number and size of these regions nearly free of traps , which induces a faster decay in the density of states and consequently a smaller probability of return to the starting point after time @xmath1 .",
    "this is reflected in a much larger exponent in the stretched exponential form of density of states than the case of uncorrelated traps .    on the other hand , as compared to the case of the same _ fractal _ substrate but with _ no _ traps , the density of states is _ qualitatively _ different , since the latter problem produces a power law density of states in the low energy limit known as _ fractons _ , accumulating to an infinite density toward the maximum eigenvalue of one @xcite .",
    "in contrast , with the perimeters acting as traps , the density of states becomes a stretched exponential , rapidly falling to zero toward the maximum eigenvalue .",
