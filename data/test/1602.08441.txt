    "very large volume neutrino telescopes ( vlv@xmath0ts ) provide a unique window to the high - energy universe  @xcite , because they allow for the detection of high - energy neutrinos which can reach the earth after having travelled from far galactic or extra - galactic sources , almost undeflected by cosmic magnetic fields and insensitive to electromagnetic and strong forces . in this respect neutrinos",
    "propagate quite differently with respect to charged cosmic rays ( crs ) , and are thus precious messengers capable of providing direct information on the regions of the universe where they are produced .",
    "a first detection of high - energy leptonic events up to an energy of a few pev was reported by the icecube collaboration . the initial evidence from the first two - year data analysis  @xcite",
    "was subsequently strenghtened by increased statistics in the three and four - year analyses  @xcite .",
    "so far , more than 50 high - energy starting events have been recorded .",
    "the discussion on the origin of these events is quite lively , and a number of hypotheses concerning the possible sources has been formulated .",
    "although it is believed that most of the neutrino events detected so far have an extraterrestrial origin , theoretical calculations predict the existence of a terrestrial component due to the decays of the unstable hadrons produced by the interactions of high - energy and ultra - high - energy crs with the earth s atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "this terrestrial component should be properly taken into account as a background and subtracted in any astrophysical analysis .",
    "the terrestrial component is usually separated into two contributions : the conventional neutrino flux , coming from the decay of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons , and the prompt neutrino flux , originating from the decay of heavier mesons and hadrons , in particular those including charm quarks as valence quarks in their composition .",
    "the prompt component is supposed to become dominant with respect to the conventional one only at energies high enough .",
    "several computations of conventional neutrino fluxes exist  ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , together with experimental evidence .",
    "on the other hand , no experimental evidence for the existence of a prompt flux has emerged so far .",
    "it is thus important to provide precise and refined theoretical predictions of prompt neutrino fluxes , to understand if the lack of detection is just due to the still low statistics of the vlv@xmath0 t experiments at high energy , or if the methodologies and/or theories used so far to predict these fluxes have  some  flaws .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we have recently computed prompt neutrino fluxes making use of qcd , with microscopic interactions described by event generators including up - to - date information from the qcd theory community working at hadron colliders .",
    "as shown in the following , we have used the same generators adopted in our astrophysical study , to produce predictions which can be compared with experimental data recently collected at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    nowadays ,",
    "state - of - the - art tools for predicting many differential distributions at the lhc are represented by shower monte carlo ( smc ) codes , matched with hard - scattering processes evaluated in perturbative qcd including next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) radiative corrections at least  @xcite .",
    "for a few selected processes , calculations at the differential level involving the resummation of different kinds of large logarithms to all orders , or next - to - nlo ( nnlo ) qcd radiative corrections , start to be available as well . however , this is not yet the case for the processes involving charm quarks we are interested in in this paper . interfacing hard scattering amplitudes including radiative corrections with the parton shower algorithms ( ps ) embedded in the smcs",
    "requires a careful matching , to avoid double counting effects and to ensure a proper coverage of the whole phase space available for light parton emissions . at present ,",
    "one of the most widely used nlo qcd + ps matching schemes is powheg  @xcite , which has been automated in dedicated tools , like e.g. the ` powhegbox `  @xcite . at nnlo",
    "the situation is even more complicated , and efforts to extend matching schemes with ps at this level of accuracy are ongoing , as well as those for pushing the accuracy of ps far beyond the present one .    in this paper",
    "we consider @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5-hadron + @xmath6 hadroproduction evaluated by means of ` powhegbox `  +  ` pythia 6 `  @xcite .",
    "this allows to generate differential distributions for the hadroproduction of different kinds of charmed mesons and hadrons at nlo qcd + ps accuracy .",
    "the ps ensures at least leading logarithmic ( ll ) accuracy in all collinear qcd emissions following the first light partonic one accompanying @xmath3 , which is instead evaluated by ` powhegbox ` with nlo accuracy .",
