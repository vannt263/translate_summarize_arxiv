    "the @xmath0he three - atomic system is of considerable interest in various fields of physical chemistry and molecular physics .",
    "studies of the helium dimer and trimer represent an important step towards understanding the properties of helium liquid drops , superfluidity in @xmath0he films , and so on ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "besides , the helium trimer is probably a unique system where a direct manifestation of the efimov effect  @xcite can be observed since the binding energy @xmath2 of the @xmath0he dimer is extremely small ( @xmath3mk  @xcite ) even in the molecular scale . for this reason ,",
    "the helium trimer is certainly of interest for nuclear physicists , too .",
    "moreover a theoretical study of the @xmath0he trimer is based just on the same methods of the theory of few - body systems that are used in solving three  body nuclear problems .    from the standpoint of the general theory of few ",
    "body systems , the @xmath0he trimer belongs to three  body systems that are most difficult for a specific investigation , first , owing to its efimov nature , and second , because it is necessary to take into account the practically hard core in the interatomic he  he - interaction  @xcite . at the same time",
    "the problem of three helium atoms can be considered as an example of an ideal three  body quantum problem since the @xmath0he atoms are identical neutral bosons with zero spin and the analysis of this problem is complicated neither by separation of spin  isospin variables nor by taking into account the coulomb interaction .",
    "there is a great number of experimental and theoretical studies of @xmath0he clusters .",
    "however , most of the theoretical investigations consist merely in computing the ground - state energies of clusters of that sort , mainly on the basis of variational methods @xcite . besides , the methods based on hyperspherical expansions of the schrdinger and faddeev equations @xcite in the coordinate representation were used . also , the faddeev integral equations in the momentum representation were employed in refs .",
    "@xcite while the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are based on a direct solving the two - dimensional faddeev differential equations in configuration space . from the experimental studies we would like to mention those of refs .",
    "@xcite where clusters consisting of a small number of noble gase atoms were investigated .",
    "though much effort was undertaken for studying molecular clusters various problems related to the @xmath0he trimer remained beyond the scope of thorough consideration .",
    "in particular , the elastic scattering phases of a helium atom on a helium dimer and breakup amplitudes ( at ultralow energies ) have been calculated only recently  @xcite .",
    "these computations were preceded only by the computation of characteristics of the he ",
    "he@xmath4 scattering at zero energy  @xcite and estimation of the recombination rate @xmath5  @xcite .    as a matter of fact",
    ", we have already pointed out basic reasons for computations of excited states and scattering being especially difficult in the @xmath0he@xmath6 system .",
    "first , this is a low energy of the dimer @xmath2 which necessitates to consider very large domains in the configuration space with a characteristic size of hundreds of  .",
    "second , a very strong repulsive component in the he  he interaction produces large errors in the standard approximation of the three ",
    "atomic hamiltonian at short distances between atoms .",
    "the capacities of modern computers do not yet allow one to reach dimensions of grids that would remove both the above - mentioned reasons and would provide stable results with the use of the conventional methods .    the present paper is a sequel of studies of the @xmath0he@xmath6 system undertaken in the papers  @xcite within an approach that is capable , as we think , to resolve both the above - mentioned numerical problems .",
    "in these papers the repulsive component of the he  he interaction at short distances between atons is approximated by a hard core .",
    "this allows one to investigate the @xmath0he@xmath6 system within a mathematically rigorous method of solving a three - body problem in the boundary - condition model developed in  @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of such an approach that essentially diminishes computational errors is the necessity to approximate , inside the core domains , only the laplacian operator instead of the sum of this operator and a huge repulsive components of the he  he - potentials ( see @xcite ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "such an approach has been successfully applied for calculating not only scattering but also binding energies of the ground and excited states of the helium trimer .",
    "investigation made in  @xcite has shown that the method proposed in  @xcite is well suited for performing three ",
    "body molecular computations in the case where repulsive components of interatomic interactions are of a hard core nature .",
    "there is a series of works @xcite showing that the excited state of the @xmath0he trimer is initiated indeed by the efimov effect  @xcite . in these works the various versions of the aziz @xmath0he@xmath0he potential were employed ( hfdhe2  @xcite , hfd - b  @xcite , and lm2m2  @xcite ) . however , the basic result of refs .",
    "@xcite on the excited state of the helium trimer is the same : this state disappears when the interatomic potential is multiplied by the  amplification factor \" @xmath7 of order 1.2 .",
    "more precisely , if this potential is multiplied by the increasing factor @xmath8 then the following effect is observed .",
    "first , the difference @xmath9 between the dimer energy @xmath10 and the energy of the trimer excited state @xmath11 increases",
    ". then the behavior of this difference radically changes and with further increase of @xmath7 it monotonously decreases . at @xmath12 the level @xmath13 disappears .",
    "it is just such a nonstandard behavior of the energy @xmath11 as the coupling between helium atoms becomes more and more strengthening , points to the efimov nature of the trimer excited state . and vice versa , when @xmath7 slightly decreases ( no more than 2% ) , the second excited state @xmath14 appears in the trimer  @xcite .",
    "this paper is aimed at elucidating the fate of the trimer excited state upon its disappearance in the physical sheet when @xmath8 and at studying the mechanism of arising of new excited states when @xmath15 .",
    "as the interatomic he  he potential , we use the potential hfd - b  @xcite .",
    "we have established that for such he  he - interactions the trimer excited level @xmath13 merges with the threshold @xmath2 at @xmath16 and with further decreasing @xmath7 it transforms into a virtual level of the first order ( a simple real pole of the analytic continuation of the scattering matrix ) lying in the unphysical energy sheet adjoining the physical sheet along the spectral interval between @xmath2 and the three  body threshold .",
    "we trace the position of this level for @xmath7 increasing up to 1.5 .",
    "besides , we have found that the excited ( efimov ) levels for @xmath15 also originate from virtual levels of the first order that are formed in pairs .",
    "before a pair of virtual levels appears , there occurs a fusion of a pair of conjugate resonances of the first order ( simple complex poles of the analytic continuation of the scattering matrix in the unphysical sheet ) resulting in the virtual level of the second order .    as it will be clear from the further exposition ( see sect .  [ results ] ) ,",
    "the above - mentioned resonances are not , generally speaking , genuine resonances of the @xmath0he@xmath6 trimer since they are situated outside of the energy domain for which we can rigorously prove the applicability of the method we are using for computing the resonances .",
    "we will call the resonances found outside the range of guaranteed applicability of the method the _ ( quasi)resonances_.    the paper is organized as follows .    in sect .",
    "[ difffs ] , we describe the method of search for resonances in a three  body system on the basis of the faddeev differential equations .",
    "the idea of the method consists in calculating the analytic continuation of the component @xmath17 ( see formula  ( [ s0 ] ) ) of the scattering matrix corresponding to the ( @xmath18 ) process , in the physical sheet with the use of these equations .",
    "a particular attention in this section is paid to the description of the parabolic domain on the physical sheet where one can analytically continue the function @xmath19 by numerical solving the coordinate space faddeev partial equations . for the potentials we use , the three  body resonances ( including virtual levels ) lying in the unphysical sheet of energy @xmath20 plane adjoining the physical sheet along the interval @xmath21 are the roots of the function @xmath19 in the physical sheet .",
    "we have earlier employed this method for computing resonances as roots of @xmath17 in the three  nucleon problem  @xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ results ] , we first briefly describe the numerical method we use to solve the @xmath1 scattering problem for the @xmath0he@xmath6 system with going out into the domain of complex energies .",
    "then we describe the results of our calculations .",

    "let us list briefly the main results of this investigation obtained by us for the @xmath0he@xmath6 system under the assumption  ( [ vexp ] ) .",
    "to formulate these results we distinguish the following three domains in the complex plane @xmath93 .",

    "the domain @xmath95 is described by the inequality @xmath100 for fixed @xmath34 the functions @xmath101 are continuous in @xmath20 up to the rims of the cut along the continuous spectrum @xmath102 .",
    "the domain @xmath103 where both the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath70 and the faddeev breakup amplitudes @xmath92 can be analytically continued in @xmath20 , @xmath104 , provided that the functions @xmath90 obey the asymptotic formulas  ( [ asbcparts ] ) .",
    "this domain is described by the inequalities @xmath105    3@xmath94 . and",
    "finally , we distinguish the domain @xmath106 , most interesting for us , where the analytic continuation in @xmath20 , @xmath104 , can be only done for the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath70 ( and consequently , for the scattering matrix @xmath19 ) ; the analytic continuabilty of the amplitudes @xmath92 in the whole domain @xmath106 is not required . the set @xmath106 is a geometric locus of points obeying the inequality @xmath107    for the domains @xmath95 , @xmath103 , and @xmath106 , the following chain of inclusions @xmath108 is valid .",

    "it is easy to check that each of these curves is connected , symmetric with respect to the @xmath118 axis and crosses the latter only once .",
    "for the first curve this intersection occurs at , the slope angle of the tangent at the point of intersection being independent of @xmath2 , . as @xmath120 , the boundaries  ( [ piamain ] ) and  ( [ piamu ] ) are asymptotically approximated by the type  ( [ parabola ] ) parabolas with coefficients @xmath121 and @xmath122 which can be computed explicitly .    to prove the assertion1@xmath94 concerning the domain",
    "@xmath95 we note that the functions @xmath101 given by the formulas ( [ flphil ] ) satisfy the equations @xmath123\\phi_l(x , y;z )   + v(x)\\sum_{l'}\\int_{-1}^{+1 }   d\\eta\\,h_{l l'}(x , y,\\eta)\\,\\phi_{l'}(x',y',z)=               \\chi_l(x , y;z)\\,\\ ] ] where @xmath124 obviously , for @xmath125 the functions @xmath126 fall off exponentially as @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , for all the directions @xmath128 the uniform estimate @xmath129 is valid with @xmath130 consequently , if the condition  ( [ pipsi ] ) holds then the inhomogeneous terms @xmath126 considered as functions of the variables @xmath131 and @xmath82 at fixed @xmath20 , are elements of @xmath132 . at the same time",

    "( [ faddxi ] ) and by the boundary conditions ( [ bcstandard ] ) in the hilbert space constituted of the vectors , @xmath134 , coincides with the spectrum @xmath52 of the corresponding three - boson schrdinger operator with two - body potentials @xmath38 only acting in the states with @xmath51 .",
    "this means that for any energy @xmath125 lying outside of the spectrum @xmath52 , the inhomogeneous system  ( [ faddxi ] ) is uniquely solvable in the class of the functions @xmath135 , @xmath51 . since outside of the set @xmath52 the resolvent of the faddeev operator is a holomorphic operator - valued function of the variable @xmath20 , each of the components @xmath136 of the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ faddxi ] ) also is a holomorphic function of @xmath98 .",
    "the bound - state energies of the three - boson system under consideration turn out to be poles of the first order for @xmath136 .",
    "thus , the faddeev partial components @xmath90 admit the analytic continuation in @xmath20 in the form  ( [ flphil ] ) into the domain @xmath137 .    the proof of the assertions of 2@xmath94 and 3@xmath94 regarding the domains @xmath106 and @xmath103 is rather cumbersome .",
    "this is why we here only outline its main steps .",
    "note that the proof is based on the integral equations method and it is quite standard ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite , chapter  v ) .",
    "first , the equations  ( [ faddxi ] ) are rewritten in the form of the faddeev partial integral equations . to do this",
    ", it suffices to reverse the operators @xmath138 in ( [ faddxi ] ) .",
    "since the variables @xmath131 and @xmath82 in @xmath36 are separated , the kernels @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , of the respective resolvents @xmath142 are explicitly expressed in terms of the two - body problem . analytic properties in the variable @xmath20 and coordinate asymptotics of the kernels @xmath139 are well known ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , chapters  iv and  v ) .",
    "iterations first  improve \" and then stabilize the asymptotic properties of the iterated kernels and inhomogeneous terms of the faddeev equations .",
    "( in the case under consideration , this stabilization requires only three iterations . )",
    "further , it turns out that , for @xmath143 , the iterated kernels are represented by sums of exponentially decreasing terms admitting , in certain domains of the configuration space , an explicit asymptotic factorization with respect to @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "since we are working in the domain where @xmath146 , the corresponding asymptotic factors of these terms , along with the asymptotics of the iterations of the inhomogeneous term , determine the coordinate asymptotics of the functions @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , finally we are able to determine the geometric locus of the points @xmath20 in the complex plane for which there exists a ( non - empty ) set in the configuration space such that the leading term of the coordinate asymptotics of the function @xmath101 in this set represents a term of the form @xmath147 , and thus , for these @xmath20 the scattering matrix @xmath19 is well defined .",

    "the point is that the position of the pole of @xmath17 is only determined by the position of the root of the determinant of the linear algebraic system we solve , whereas the inhomogeneous term of the system plays no role .",
    "therefore , the search for the poles of the grid function @xmath19 is equivalent to the search for the binding energies of the trimer .",
    "the grids we have used turn out to be quite sufficient for this purpose . the convergence of our results for @xmath13 with respect to the parameters @xmath271 and their accuracy can be judged from the values of the difference @xmath272 obtained with different grids and shown in table  ii .",
    "we would like to stress that we do not consider the roots of function @xmath19 drawn in fig .  1 as genuine resonances for the @xmath0he@xmath6 system since they are situated beyond the domain @xmath106 where the applicability of our method is proved .",
    "we should rather consider them as artifacts of the method .",
    "however it is remarkable that the  true \" ( i.e. , getting inside @xmath106 ) virtual levels and then the energies of the excited ( efimov ) states appear just due to these ( quasi)resonances when the potential @xmath38 is weakened . this is the object of our further consideration .",
    "following  @xcite , instead of the initial potential @xmath273 , we will consider the potentials @xmath274 to establish the mechanism of formation of new excited states in the @xmath0he trimer , we have first calculated the scattering matrix @xmath19 for @xmath15 . in table",
    "iii for some values of @xmath7 from the interval between 0.995 and 0.975 , we present the positions of roots and poles of @xmath19 , we have obtained at real @xmath275 . we have found that for a value of @xmath7 slightly smaller than @xmath276 , the ( quasi)resonance closest to the real axis ( see fig .",
    "1 ) gets on it and transforms into a virtual level ( the root of @xmath19 ) of the second order corresponding to the energy value where the graph of @xmath19 , @xmath277 , @xmath250 , is tangent to the axis @xmath20 .",
    "this virtual level is preceded by the ( quasi)resonances mk for @xmath278 and mk for @xmath279 .",
    "the originating virtual level is of the second order since simultaneously with the root of the function @xmath17 , also the conjugate root of this function gets on the real axis . with a subsequent decrease of @xmath7 the virtual level of the second order splits into a pair of the virtual levels @xmath280 and @xmath281 , @xmath282 of the first order which move in opposite directions . a characteristic behavior of the scattering matrix @xmath19 when resonances transform into virtual levels is shown in fig .",
    "the virtual level @xmath281 moves towards the threshold @xmath2 and `` collides '' with it at @xmath283 . for @xmath284",
    "the function @xmath19 has no longer the root corresponding to @xmath281 . instead of the root",
    ", it acquires a new pole corresponding to the second excited state of the trimer with the energy @xmath14 . note that though the virtual levels @xmath280 and @xmath281 appear beyond the domain @xmath106 , already at @xmath285 the point @xmath281 turns out to be inside this domain .",
    "therefore , it should be considered as a `` true '' virtual level of the trimer .",
    "we expect that the subsequent efimov levels originate from the virtual levels just according to the same scheme as the level @xmath14 does .",
    "the other purpose of the present investigation is to determine the mechanism of disappearance of the excited state of the helium trimer when the two - body interactions become stronger owing to the increasing coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "it turned out that this disappearance proceeds just according to the scheme of the formation of new excited states ; only the order of occurring events is inverse .",
    "the results of our computations of the energy @xmath13 when @xmath7 changes from 1.05 to 1.17 are given in table  iv .",
    "in the interval between @xmath286 and @xmath287 there occurs a  jump \" of the level @xmath13 on the unphysical sheet and it transforms from the pole of the function @xmath17 into its root , @xmath288 , corresponding to the trimer virtual level .",
    "the results of calculation of this virtual level where @xmath7 changes from 1.18 to 1.5 are presented in table  v. for all the values of @xmath7 presented in tables  iv and  v , the dimer possesses an only bound state .",
    "we have found that the first excited state of the dimer appears only at @xmath289 .",
    "note that in the case of finite potentials the geometric characteristics of the domain @xmath106 where the function @xmath19 can be calculated reliably , are only determined by the value of @xmath290 ( see formula  ( [ pipsi ] ) for @xmath205 ) .",
    "when @xmath290 increases , the domain @xmath106 is enlarged .",
