    "physics and chemistry of clusters are very active areas of research especially because of the emergence of nano science and nano technology .",
    "@xcite although major efforts have been spent into ground - state investigations , finite temperature properties are turning out to be very interesting .",
    "such investigations are challenging , both experimentally as well as theoretically .",
    "one of the first detailed measurements providing much impetus for theoretical work was on free sodium clusters by haberland and co - workers .",
    "@xcite these measurements reported the melting temperatures ( t@xmath3 ) of sodium clusters in the size range between 55 and 350 and remained unexplained for almost about a decade .",
    "the main puzzle was related to the irregular behavior of the melting temperature and the absence of any correlation between the peaks and the magic numbers either geometric or electronic .",
    "a good deal of simulation works has been carried out to explain the sodium data , most of the early work being with classical inter atomic potentials .",
    "@xcite it turned out that none of these could obtain qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "thus , it needed an _ ab initio _ density - functional method to achieve this . indeed",
    ", much insight and excellent quantitative agreement has been obtained by density - functional molecular dynamics ( dfmd ) simulations .  @xcite    recently a very different aspect of finite temperature behavior has been brought out by the experimental and later by theoretical work on gallium clusters .",
    "@xcite the experimental reports of breaux and co - workers  @xcite showed that in the size range of @xmath4=30 to 55 , free clusters of gallium melt much above their bulk melting temperature .",
    "interestingly , their experiment also showed that the nature of heat capacity is size sensitive .",
    "in fact , addition of even one atom changes the shape of the heat capacity dramatically , e.g for ga@xmath5 and ga@xmath6 .",
    "a similar experimental observation has been reported for aluminum clusters in the size range @xmath1=49 - 62 .",
    "@xcite such a size sensitive behavior has also been observed in dfmd simulation of au@xmath7 and au@xmath8 .",
    "@xcite a detailed analysis of the ground - state geometries of these clusters brought out the role of order and disorder in their geometries on the shape of the melting curve .",
    "a disordered system is shown to display a continuous melting transition leading to a very broad heat capacity curve . however , the effect is subtle and description of order and disorder needs careful qualifications .    in spite of substantial experimental works on sodium clusters over a period of 10 years and or so ,",
    "there is no firm and systematic evidence of size sensitivity .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the reported experimental data  @xcite is for the size range of @xmath1=55 - 350 at discrete sizes .",
    "it is necessary to investigate the effect of addition of few atoms in a continuous manner in appropriate size range .",
    "however , it is not clear whether larger clusters having sizes of @xmath9100 will also show this effect .",
    "an extensive _ ab initio _ study on the structural properties of small na clusters up to @xmath4=20 has been reported by rthlisberger and andreoni .",
    "@xcite the study reveals that pentagonal motifs dominate the structures above @xmath4=7 .",
    "as expected most of the atoms in these clusters lie on the surface and a discernible core develops after about @xmath4=15 - 16 .",
    "the shapes after this sizes show signature of icosahedral structures .    the finite temperature behavior of sodium clusters in the size range of @xmath1=8 to 55 has been reported .",
    "@xcite the study reveals that it is not easy to discern any melting peaks below @xmath1=25 .",
    "however , the simulation data available at rather coarse sizes above @xmath1=40 already shows size - sensitive feature .",
    "in addition to this feature , our recent investigation  @xcite on na@xmath10 and na@xmath11 does bring out the role of geometry and electronic structure on the melting .",
    "nevertheless , in order to draw definitive conclusions it is necessary to investigate the effect of addition of a few atoms in a continuous manner in appropriate size range .",
    "therefore , we have chosen the size range of @xmath1=39 - 55 and have carried out detailed density - functional investigations .",
    "the purpose of the present work is two fold .",
    "first , to obtain reliable equilibrium geometries for all the clusters in the size range of @xmath1=39 - 55 and to discern evolutionary trends .",
    "we note that na@xmath12 has a symmetric partially icosahedron core and na@xmath13 is a complete icosahedron .",
    "thus it is of considerable interest to examine the growth pattern from @xmath1=39 to @xmath1=55 .",
    "the second purpose is to seek correlation between the nature of the ground - state and the evolutionary trends observed in the nature of their specific heats . towards this end",
    "we have carried out extensive finite temperature simulations on representative clusters of size @xmath1= 43 , 45 , 48 , and 52 .",
    "together with the already published results , this gives us access to specific heats for na@xmath12 , na@xmath14 , na@xmath15 , na@xmath16 , na@xmath17 , na@xmath18 and na@xmath13 , a reasonable representation across the series under investigation .",
    "finally , we note that all the dfmd simulations reported so far have yielded excellent agreement with the experimental data  @xcite these reports demonstrate the reliability of density - functional molecular dynamics in describing the finite temperature properties .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : comp ] ) we note the computational details .",
    "[ sec : geom ] presents equilibrium geometries and their shape systematic .",
    "[ sec : therm ] presents the finite temperatures behavior of na@xmath14 , na@xmath15 , na@xmath16 , na@xmath18 and finally we discuss the correlation between the ground states and nature of the specific heats for all the available thermodynamics data .",
    "we conclude our discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "we have carried out born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics ( bomd ) simulations  @xcite using vanderbilt s ultrasoft pseudopotentials  @xcite within the local - density approximation ( lda ) , as implemented in the vasp package .",
    "@xcite we have optimized about 300 geometries for each of the sodium clusters in the size range between @xmath1=39 and @xmath1=55 . the initial configuration for the optimization of each cluster were obtained by carrying out a constant temperature dynamics simulation of 60  ps each at various temperatures between 300 to 400  k. for many of the geometries we have also employed basin hopping  @xcite and genetic  @xcite algorithms using gupta potential  @xcite for generating initial guesses .",
    "then we optimized these structures by using the _ ab initio _ density - functional method .",
    "@xcite for computing the heat capacities , the iso - kinetic bomd calculations were carried out at 14 different temperatures for each cluster of na@xmath14 , na@xmath15 , na@xmath16 , na@xmath18 in the range between 100  k and 460  k , each with the time duration of 180  ps or more .",
    "thus , it results in the total simulation time of 2.5  ns per system . in order to get converged heat capacity curve especially in the region of co - existence",
    ", more temperatures were required with longer simulation times .",
    "we have discarded at least first 30  ps for each temperature for thermalization . to analyze the thermodynamic properties , we first calculate the ionic specific heat by using the multiple histogram ( mh ) technique .",
    "@xcite we extract the classical ionic density of states ( @xmath19 ) of the system , or equivalently the classical ionic entropy , @xmath20 , following the mh technique . with @xmath21 in hand , one can evaluate thermodynamic averages in a variety of ensembles .",
    "we focus in this work on the ionic specific heat . in the canonical ensemble",
    ", the specific heat is defined as usual by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the average total energy .",
    "the probability of observing an energy @xmath24 at a temperature @xmath25 is given by the gibbs distribution @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the normalizing canonical partition function .",
    "we normalize the calculated canonical specific heat by the zero - temperature classical limit of the rotational plus vibrational specific heat , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite    we have calculated a number of thermodynamic indicators such as root - mean - square bond length fluctuations ( @xmath29 ) , mean square displacements ( msd ) and radial distribution function ( g(r ) ) .",
    "the @xmath29 is defined as    @xmath30    where @xmath4 is the number of atoms in the system , @xmath31 is the distance between atoms @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and @xmath34 denotes a time average over the entire trajectory .",
    "msds for individual atoms is another traditional parameter used for determining phase transition and is defined as ,    @xmath35^{2 } \\label{eqn : msq}\\ ] ]    where * r*@xmath36 is the position of the @xmath37@xmath38 atom and we average over m different time origins t@xmath39 spanning over the entire trajectory .",
    "the interval between the consecutive t@xmath39 for the average was taken to be about 1.5  ps .",
    "the msds of a cluster indicate the displacement of atoms in the cluster as a function of time .",
    "the g(r ) is defined as the average number of atoms within the region @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we have also calculated the shape deformation parameter ( @xmath42 ) , to analyze the shape of the ground state for all the clusters .",
    "the @xmath42 is defined as ,    @xmath43    where @xmath44",
    "are the eigenvalues , in descending order , of the quadrupole tensor    @xmath45    here @xmath32 and @xmath33 run from 1 to 3 , @xmath37 runs over the number of ions , and @xmath46 is the i@xmath38 coordinate of ion @xmath37 relative to the center of mass ( com ) of the cluster .",

    "= 0.35    = 0.45    = 0.63    it is convenient to divide these clusters into three groups . the clusters in the first group , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are nearly spherical .",
    "the ground - state geometry for na@xmath49 is highly symmetric .",
    "this structure has three identical units , each based on the icosahedral motive and these three units are arranged as shown in the fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that an addition of an extra atom changes the structure dramatically .",
    "it can be seen that the geometry of na@xmath12 is based on icosahedral structure with missing 12 corner atoms and ( 111 ) facet as reported by rytknen _",
    "et al _ .",
    "@xcite an extra atom added to this structure is accommodated near the surface and deforms the structure slightly .",
    "in addition to the deformation the distance between the two shells is reduced by 0.3    as compared to that in na@xmath12 .",
    "a single atom added to na@xmath50 is not accommodated in the structure , instead it caps the surface .",
    "however , the low - lying geometries for na@xmath51 have a spherical shape without any cap ( figure not shown ) .",
    "the lowest - energy structure of na@xmath14 shows two caps symmetrically placed on the opposite side of na@xmath50 , accompanied by distortion of the icosahedral core .",
    "the second group in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] consisting of the clusters with @xmath1=44 - 52 shows substantial distortion of the icosahedral core and even loss of this core structure .",
    "these clusters essentially represent the transition region from the two shell icosahedron , na@xmath12 to three shell complete icosahedron ,",
    "it can be seen that by adding one atom to na@xmath14 the two shell core is destroyed .",
    "the growth from @xmath1=44 to @xmath1=52 shows successive stages of capping followed by rearrangement in the inner core . there is a dramatic change in the structure as soon as we add one more atom to na@xmath18 .",
    "all the atoms rearrange to form an icosahedral structure as seen in na@xmath52 .",
    "thus , the clusters in the last group namely , na@xmath52 and na@xmath53 differ from a perfect icosahedron of na@xmath13 by an absence of two and one atom(s ) , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the nature of the changes in the shape of the clusters during the growth can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "the shape deformation parameter ( @xmath42 ) increases to a value about 2 up to na@xmath18 with slightly higher values for na@xmath15 and na@xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . however , this value drops suddenly for na@xmath52 .",
    "it is interesting to examine the three eigenvalues of quadrupole tensor ( @xmath55 ) shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that two of the eigenvalues are nearly same up to na@xmath18 while the third one continuously grows and indicates that the growth dominantly takes place along one of the directions .",
    "a prolate configuration has @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the majority of the clusters in the second group are prolate .",
    "the formation , the destruction and reformation of the shell structure is clearly seen in fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "in this figure we have plotted the distance of each atom from the center of mass arranged in the increasing fashion .",
    "clearly small rearrangement of atoms yields a change in the structure from na@xmath49 to na@xmath12 .",
    "the two shell structures are observed till na@xmath14 .",
    "the formation of the shell structure is reflected in the formation of the sharp steps in the graph .",
    "as the size increases from na@xmath14 to na@xmath57 the shell structure is destroyed and seen again at na@xmath52 .",
    "thus , three shells begin to emerge at na@xmath52 .",
    "we have calculated the ionic heat capacity and indicators like mean square displacements ( msd ) and root - mean - square bond length fluctuations ( @xmath29 ) for four of the representative clusters in the investigated series which are na@xmath14 , na@xmath15 , na@xmath16 , and na@xmath18 .",

    "[ fig8](a ) ) is responsible for the weak peak .",

    "[ fig11](b ) , respectively .",
    "we have observed the ionic trajectories as a movie in the temperature at 225  k. it turns out that about one third of atoms in the cluster  melt \" at this temperature .",

    "[ fig11](a ) and [ fig11](b ) .",
    "interestingly , all these 15 atoms are on the surface , indicating that surface melting takes place first .",

    "the systematic evolution of heat capacities can be better appreciated by examination of all the available data ( calculated from density - functional simulation ) . in fig .",

    "have well recognizable peaks which are broader than that of na@xmath13 . the disordered phase of the growth is clearly reflected in the very broad heat capacities seen around @xmath1=50 .",
    "the _ ab initio _ density - functional method has been applied to investigate systematic evolutionary trends in the ground state geometries of the sodium clusters in the size range of @xmath1=39 - 55 .",
    "the dfmd finite temperature simulations have been carried out for representative clusters .",
    "a detailed comparison between the heat capacities and the geometries firmly establishes a direct influence of the geometries on the shapes of the heat capacity curves .",
