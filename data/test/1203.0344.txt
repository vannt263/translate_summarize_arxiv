    "magellanic stream ( ms hereafter ) was found as a long filament of  gas around our galaxy @xcite .",
    "ms is thought to be stripped gas from small magellanic cloud and/or large magellanic cloud . it has been revealed that ms consists of multi - phase gas components ; molecular gas ,  gas ,  gas , and highly ionized plasma ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "ms is the only clear example of a gaseous halo stream in the close proximity of milky way @xcite .",
    "it gives us important clues to the physical interaction between galaxy and its satellites in detail .",
    "the  emission from ms has been first reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ww96 ) .",
    "@xcite have found several other  emitting regions .",
    "the ionizing source of these regions is still a mystery because no ionizing star is observed in the stream .",
    "there are several models to explain the origin of the ms  clouds .",
    "ww96 argued that the emissions are explained by ram pressure heating .",
    "however , this model required much higher density of halo gas than ww96 estimated , because the distance to ms was found to be larger than expected @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented another model that ionizing photons escaping from galactic disk heat up ms .",
    "this model predicted that the  emission would be smoothly distributed .",
    "however it is inconsistent with the fact that the contrast of the  emission is as large as a factor of 30 @xcite .",
    "* hereafter b07 ) presented yet another model incorporating a shock heating and its propagation ( shock cascade ) .",
    "they predicted high /  ratio , and strong ,  emissions , which have not been examined yet .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated the absorption features of active galactic nuclei behind ms in order to study the ionization structure of the ms  clouds .",
    "they found that the ionization structure can not be reproduced by an evaporative interaction with the galactic corona plus photoionization .    in order to study the ionization mechanism and kinematics of the ms  clouds , detailed spectroscopic follow - up observations",
    "are required .",
    "however , positional information necessary to perform a medium to high dispersion spectroscopy has been so far very limited .",
    "the exact position and detailed morphology of the  emitting region found by ww96 was not clear , because they used a fabry - prot interferometer and the spatial structure inside the fabry - prot beam of 7 arcmin diameter was averaged .",
    "there are several other  surveys which overlaps the ms fields .",
    "southern  sky survey atlas ( shassa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) presents  map of 0.8 arcmin pixel .",
    "they used a 3.2 nm width filter to detect  emissions .",

    "the spatial resolutions of those works are still not enough for a slit spectroscopy .",
    "we performed imaging observations with higher spatial resolution at the northern part of ms iv where ww96 detected the  emissions . in this letter , we report the positions and the shapes of the  emitting regions we detected .",
    "we observed two ww96 fields , ms iv - c ( 23:44:34.8,-12:23:20,j2000.0 ) and ms iv - d ( 23:40:49.0,-10:45:32,j2000.0 ) with 2kccd camera @xcite mounted on kiso 105 cm schmidt camera at the kiso observatory in september 2011 .",
    "the pixel scale is 1.5 arcsec pixel@xmath1 , and the field of view ( fov ) is 51.2 arcmin square .",
    "we used r - band and three narrow band filters ( n657 , ha6577 , and ha6417 ) .",
    "the filter characteristics are shown in table 1 .",
    "the variation of the wavelength coverage is no worse than 3.6  across the filter in ha6577 and ha6417 . for n657 ,",
    "the transmission curve at the corner is shifted by 10  to the red from that at the center .",
    "we took the exposures with @xmath7 7.5 arcmin dithering .",
    "the typical seeing size was 4.1 arcsec .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the mosaic ccd data reduction packages @xcite .",
    "overscan subtraction , bias pattern subtraction , flat - fielding with domeflat were performed in a standard manner .",
    "the pixel scale of the images are slightly different among filters .",
    "the difference was corrected before coadding using the results by smoka team ( s. ichikawa , private communication ) .",
    "the sky background was subtracted in each frame before coadding with background mesh size of 1024 pixels ( 25.6 arcmin ) .",
    "therefore , structures larger than 25 arcmin square would have been removed .",
    "after the coadding , stellar objects were detected by sextractor @xcite , and the astrometric calibration was performed using wcstools @xcite referring to usno - b1 catalog @xcite .",
    "we calibrated the flux using the photometry of stars by sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 @xcite in the northern half of the ms iv - d field .",
    "the color conversion from sdss r and i to kiso 2kccd filters are constructed by fitting a quadratic function to the photometry of model spectral energy distributions ( seds ) by bruzual - pearson - gunn - stryker atlas and the filter responses , as the method in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the best - fit functions are @xmath8 where @xmath9= ( 0.003,0.267,0.052 ) , ( -0.075,0.773,-0.292 ) , ( -0.034,0.653,-0.210 ) , and ( 0.014,0.262,0 ) for r , n657 , ha6577 , and ha6417 , respectively , in ab - magnitude for @xmath10 stars . the dispersion of our photometry around the fit is 0.06  0.1 mag in rms converted from the median of absolute deviation in each band . as ms iv - c is not covered by sdss , we roughly estimated the zero point using r - band ( @xmath11-band ) photometry of usno - b1.0 @xcite in naval observatory merged astrometric dataset @xcite .",
    "the error is estimated to be @xmath7 0.15 mag .",
    "galactic extinction is about @xmath12 in ms iv - c and ms iv - d from @xcite via the extinction calculator in nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "we adopted 0.09 mag for all of the 4 bands .",
    "the limiting surface brightness ( sb ) of the final images of ms iv - d in 15 arcsec ( 10 pix ) square are presented in table 1 .",
    "we performed eye inspections to detect possible  emitting regions . in the ms iv - c field",
    ", we could not find any sign of  excess brighter than 800 mr photons m@xmath3",

    "the conversion from sb of n657-r to total +  brightness requires the redshift and the line full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) information , which are unavailable yet . in this study",
    ", we therefore assume that the line is located at the wavelength of the maximum transmittance of each filter , and that the line width is much narrower than the filter fwhm .",
    "this gives the lower limit of the +  brightness .    in the ms iv - d field , we detected regions with n657 excess relative to r - band .",

    "three filamentary  regions are seen in the lower half region of fig .",
    "1a and 1b .",
    "we call the  regions as d1 , d2 , and d3 from the east to the west , hereafter . except the three",
    ", we could not detect  emitting structures brighter than 240 mr ( 1@xmath14 of the n657-r image ) with size between 15 arcsec and 25 arcmin scale in 74 @xmath4 60 arcmin field of mv iv - d .",
    "1c shows the effective exposure time map of n657-r and the position of the  regions .",
    "because of the bad weather , the southwest part has low s / n .",
    "it should also be noted that a bright star at the southwest of d2 made it difficult to measure the emission around it .",
    "we found d1 and part of d3 in the ha6577 image with sb of 26.3 mag arcsec@xmath3 .",
    "the three  regions are fainter than 27 mag arcsec@xmath3 in r - band . in the ha6417 image , neither d1 nor d2 were detected , and d3 was located outside of the fov .",
    "d1 was also found in the n657-ha6417 image , and marginally recognized in the ha6577-ha6417 image . in the ha6577-r image ,",
    "d1 and d3 were detected , and d2 was marginally detected . in the n657-ha6577 image ,",
    "d1 was marginally positive ( n657 bright ) with low s / n , and d2 and d3 were not detected . in summary ,",
    "the excess was found in n657-r , n657-ha6417 , and ha6577-r , and marginally in n657-ha6577 .",
    "the detection in several combination of bands suggests that the features are real emissions .",
    "we investigated the possibility of artifacts .",
    "if the filaments were fringes made by sky lines , they should also appear in other fields , but we could not detect such features in other fields ( e.g. , ms iv - c ) .",
    "we also checked whether the regions were seen in coadded images of each day , and confirmed that they were not moving objects nor transient phenomena .",
    "the positions and the shapes remained the same during the observation .",
    "when we observe other brighter stars in another field , we found some ghosts of the optics appear .",
    "the ghosts moved when we shifted the fov , and they appeared at different position in ha6577 and n657 . on the contrary ,",
    "d1d3 did not move and stayed at the same position in the sky in both filters .",
    "moreover , we made additional observations in november 2011 for the filaments with ha6577 . at that time , we shifted the field to avoid the bright star at south - east .",
    "the filaments d1 and d3 were still detected at the same position .",
    "d1d3 are therefore not ghosts .",
    "we conclude that the three regions are genuine  emitting regions .",
    "the flux weighted center of the regions are shown in table 2 .",
    "the positions are 20  50 arcmin away from the aperture of mv iv - d by ww96 ( fig .",
    "we defined the boundary of the filaments for a quantitative analysis as follows .",
    "first , we masked bright objects in r - band , because a residual of subtraction may remain in the n657-r image at the position .",
    "next , we applied a 7@xmath47 pix ( 10.5 arcsec square ) median filtering to gain s / n .",
    "then the r - band image is subtracted from the n657 image , and binned into 10@xmath410 pix ( 15 arcsec square ) . in the image , we defined the boundary as the isophote of 220mr , which corresponds to 1-@xmath14 . above the isophote",
    "the regions have @xmath72 arcmin wide and 16 , 6 , and 29 arcmin long for d1 , d2 , and d3 , respectively .",
    "the interval between d1 and d2 are about 12 arcmin , and that between d2 and d3 is also @xmath712 arcmin . if the regions lie at ms distance ( 55 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the width of the three  regions is 30 pc , intervals between them are 200 pc each , and the length are 100  500 pc .    for photometric analysis",
    ", we used the isophote as the boundary and extracted the regions before median filtering .",
    "the sb of the  regions in the n657-r image are 370 mr on average in 15 arcsec square , which corresponds to +  brightness of @xmath15 .",
    "the sb gradient is seen in d1 and d3 .",
    "the north - west edge is the faintest in sb in d3 , and the gradient is about 20 mr arcmin@xmath1 .",
    "the gradient in d1 has an opposite direction ; the sb is the faintest at the southeast edge , rises by 60 mr arcmin@xmath1 for 10 arcmin , then gradually get fainter toward north west .",
    "the gradient is not seen in d2 .",
    "our observed field was covered by two  surveys .",
    "one is shassa @xcite .",
    "the  bandwidth ( 3.2 nm ) of shassa is comparable to our n657 .",
    "@xcite removed stellar contamination from the shassa data and calibrated the flux .",
    "there are several bright parts in shassa data which overlap d1d3 . however ,",
    "when we checked the original data of shassa , they are not permanent but variable among exposures . the bright parts would be artifacts .",
    "the other survey is wham , which covers a velocity range of @xmath16 km s@xmath1 with respect to lsr .",
    "one of wham beam , @xmath17(73.377 , -67.054 ) is just on d1 @xcite .",
    "if we average the +  flux of the regions d1d3 in 1 degree aperture of wham , it would be observed as @xmath7 5 mr excess , which is too faint to be found in wham .",
    "we overlap the position of the  regions on the  contour using galactic all - sky survey ( gass ) second data release @xcite in fig .",
    "2 . the regions d1d3 lie on an overlap of two  components at @xmath18 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath19 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we thus coadd the gass data over two velocity ranges ; @xmath20 km  s@xmath1 as the high velocity component(hvc ) , and @xmath21 km  s@xmath1 as the low velocity component(lvc ) .    in hvc map ( fig 2a ) , an  cloud with a horseshoe like morphology is located at @xmath22(73.5 , -68 ) @xcite , which is at the southeast of our observed field .",
    "the  cloud is also recognized in the @xmath23 km  s@xmath1 panel of fig .",
    "6 of @xcite .",
    "they mentioned that filaments of ms appear to merge at several points , and there are dense concentrations of gas at these points .",
    "they listed the cloud at ( l , b)=(74,-68 ) as an example of the merging points .",
    "the regions d1d3 are located on this cloud . spatial correspondence between d1d3 and",
    "the  cloud suggests that the  regions are associated with ms , and we regard them as candidates of  emitting regions of ms .",
    "the  column density around the  regions are @xmath24 @xmath2 from the contour by @xcite .    in lvc ( fig .",
    "2b ) , there are two clouds around the edge of the filaments , and it is also possible that d1d3 are associated with lvc .",
    "the  column density around the  regions are @xmath25 @xmath2 .",
    "we roughly estimate the column density of the ionized gas . as the typical flux is 370 mr including , we adopt 300 mr for  flux in this section , assuming /  @xmath26 @xcite for simplicity .",
    "the value is a typical one for  regions , and it would be largely different if the ionization process is different , such as shocks .",
    "we assume that the  emitting region is a homogeneously distributed , optically thin gas cloud , and is embedded in an isotropic radiation field .",
    "for , 1 rayleigh corresponds to an emission measure ( em ) of about 2 @xmath27 pc@xcite .",
    "therefore the em of d1d3 is @xmath7 0.6 @xmath27 pc .",
    "the em is written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the electron density , and @xmath30 is the mean length of line of sight .",
    "the column density is then @xmath31 it is about 1/2@xmath321/8 of  column density ( @xmath33 @xmath2 ) , if @xmath34 pc .",
    "this rough calculation may overestimate the column density , because , in the real , the  surface brightness distribution is not homogeneous .",
    "in addition , the redshift and the degree of  contamination are unknown .",
    "since ww96 discovered the  emission from ms , several hypotheses have been proposed for the ionization mechanism of the  emitting gas .",
    "a promising theory would be the shock - induced model presented by b07 .",
    "they suggested that the interaction between the fragmented clouds formed in the upstream of ms and the tenuous gas ablated from the upstream clouds would lead to shock ionization at the leading edges of the downstream clouds .    if the northwest cloud in fig .",
    "2a , which lies in the downstream of the main ms iv cloud at southeast , is following the main cloud ,  would be emitted at the leading edge of the northwest cloud according to the b07 model .",
    "on the contrary , d1d3 appear to lie along the  stream between the northwest and the main clouds .",
    "their straight and almost parallel filamentary morphology do not resemble the  distribution predicted by b07 .",
    "however , note that the widths of d1d3 , @xmath35 pc , are smaller than the spatial resolution of the simulations ( @xmath36 pc ) of b07 .",
    "in addition , kpc scale structures of the  emission may be lost in this study due to our sky subtraction method ( see section 2 ) .",
    "thus , the spatial resolution mismatch between our observation and the b07 simulation may lead this apparent inconsistency in ionized gas morphology .",
    "the  regions we detected may be a part of dense ridges , which can be formed by kelvin - helmholtz instability at the  cloud surface , of tenuously extended ionized clouds .",
    "the long and straight shape of d1d3 resembles the  filament reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mb01 ) . the mb01 cloud has a region of 20 arcsec wide and 1.2 degree long and forks into two segments with the widest separation of 5 arcmin .",
    "mb01 presented four possible origins for such a cloud ; 1 ) a jet , 2 ) a filamentary local nebula , 3 ) a shock ionized trail , and 4 ) a fossil strmgren trail ( fst ) , and they concluded their object would be fst . if d1d3 are local objects , the origin of d1d3 would be one of the four . following the discussion by mb01",
    ", the faint sb rejects 1 ) , and the straight shape and the intensity gradient along the shape reject 2 ) , and 2 arcmin width rejects 3 ) as the d1d3 origin . and 4 ) , fst by a single star , is difficult , since the gradient has opposite direction in d1 and d3 .",
    "if d1d3 are local objects , the possible origin is that they are fsts of different stars .",
    "all the three might be made by three different stars or by two stars if d2 is a branch of d1 or d3 like the y - shaped filament found by mb01 .",
    "if d1d3 are fsts , we can estimate the distance using equation ( 5 ) of mb01 .",
    "putting i()@xmath37=300 mr , width @xmath38=2 arcmin , and the assumption by mb01 that projection factor @xmath39=1 , temperature t=@xmath40k , and density n=1 @xmath41 , we can estimate that the distance is @xmath7180 pc .",
    "the physical size is 0.1pc wide and 0.3  1.5 pc long .",
    "we detected three filamentary  emitting regions in the ms iv - d field .",
    "their sizes are 2 arcmin wide and 6  30 arcmin long , and their surface brightness of +  are 370 mr on average in 15 arcsec bin .",
    "they are candidates of  emitting regions associating with ms iv , although we can not deny the possibility that they are local objects .",
    "if they are at ms distance , the size is 30 pc @xmath4 100  500 pc . if they are local objects , fossil strmgren trails @xcite created by more than two stars is a possible interpretation .",
