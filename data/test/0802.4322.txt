    "it is generally accepted that accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) is the major source of their growth during the periods of the active nuclei duty cycles ( chokshi & turner 1992 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ; marconi et al .",

    "2000 ; 2003 ) .",
    "several parameters in these models are strongly degenerated , it remains an open question whether the smbh is rapidly rotating .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to estimate the smbh spin based on the tev variability detected in m87 by high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) ( aharonian et al .",
    "an origin from jet has been ruled out ( aharonian et al .",

    "the self - similar solution of the adaf is characterized by a factor @xmath13 , which describes the fraction of the released gravitational energy that is advected into the black hole .",
    "the tendency of @xmath14 has been verified by extensive numerical calculations of the global solution of the adaf ( e.g. narayan et al .",
    "1997 ; manmoto et al .",
    "we define @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the accretion rate , @xmath17 the radiative efficiency and @xmath18 the eddington luminosity .",
    "there are five parameters ( @xmath19 ) in the adaf model , where @xmath4 is the viscosity , @xmath20 the inner radius of the adaf , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the gas and magnetic pressures , respectively .",

    "we begin by fitting the observed multiwavelength sed of m87 to determine the best - fit parameters of the accretion flow .",
    "then , we find the optical depth of the adaf radiation to tev photons .",
    "we include synchrotron , multiple compton scattering and free - free emission processes in this calculations .",
    "we follow the numerical scheme for the emergent spectrum described in manmoto et al .",

    "2000 ) in this letter .",
    "[ fig1 ]    we used the black hole mass measured by _",
    "hst _ in fitting the continuum .",
    "the viscosity and advection factors of @xmath4 and @xmath13 are actually absorbed into one parameter in the self - similar solution .",
    "though the viscosity @xmath4 is highly unknown , only their combination of @xmath4 and @xmath13 is important for the sed model ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "the final optical depth to tev photons is directly dependent on the radial sed rather than @xmath4 and @xmath13 , so we take typical values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the adaf spectrum is characterized by a sharp peak of synchrotron emission from moderately relativistic electrons , multiple bumps from inverse compton scattering and a high energy peak with a cutoff originating from bremsstrahlung emission from the very hot plasma in the adaf .",
    "the roles of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are clear in fittings of the continuum ( narayan & yi 1995 ) if the inner radius of the adaf is fixed . for a plasma with equipartition between the gas and magnetic fields , @xmath35 . for @xmath36 ,",
    "the plasma is weakly magnetized and for @xmath37 the plasma is strongly magnetized .",
    "usually @xmath38 works generally , but it is needed to be elaborately adjusted for specific fittings . for a model with a fixed @xmath20 ,",
    "the synchrotron peak is primarily determined by @xmath39 , while the compton bumps and x - ray peak are sensitive to @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "1 shows the best fittings adaf models with @xmath40 .",
    "the kerr model , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , is consistent with the entire spectrum from radio to x - rays , while the schwarzschild model with @xmath41 and @xmath43 can match the data at only radio , near ir and optical wavelengths , but always not with the x - ray data .",
    "the differences between the two models originate from the fact that the kerr black hole has higher radiation efficiency than the schwarzschild . for the same total luminosity ,",
    "the accretion rate is lower for the kerr hole than the schwarzschild , resulting in a thinner medium of the accreting gas and then reduced free - free emission in x - ray band .",
    "we note , however , that modified models of the adaf might in principle produce a variety of spectra ( di matteo et al .",
    "2003 ) and that measurements of the smbh spins strongly depend upon @xmath34 .",
    "we present a new method for revealing the smbh spin using the constraints from tev variability .",
    "uncertainties in the adaf fit model results are primarily governed by @xmath34 and @xmath20 for models with fixed @xmath4 and @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , the modeled x - ray spectrum strongly depends on both @xmath34 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is difficult to estimate these uncertainties , however the upper limit of @xmath20 will be constrained by the upper limit of the region responsible for the observed tev variability .",

    "the vertical structure of the adaf is unknown , but it is generally assumed that the vertical density has an exponential profile ( e.g. manmoto et al . 1997 ) . we follow this with the assumption that most of the emitted photons originate from the mid - plane of the accretion disk . with simple manipulation , we have @xmath45 , and the distance @xmath46 the cosine of the angle between two interacting photons is then @xmath47 we then have the number density of photons from the adaf , given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the upper stream flux of photons from a radius @xmath50 , the factor of @xmath51 is the projected area element in the direction dp , @xmath52 is the mass of the electron and @xmath53 is the photon energy in units of @xmath54 .",

    "3 shows the seds for both kerr and schwarzschild black holes at four and three different radii , respectively .",
    "the seds demonstrate that gravitational energy is dissipated in a more compact region for a kerr hole than a schwarzschild .",
    "this is the key point that provides an opportunity to probe the black hole spin .",
    "we stress here that we neglect general relativistic ( gr ) effects in this paper , however the release of gravitational energy via viscous dissipation will be concentrated in a more compact region if we include the effects .",
    "this , in fact , increases the robustness of the conclusions presented here .",
    "more sophisticated model including gr effects will be given in a future paper .",
    "tev photons can divulge details of the ambient radiation field through their dilution via pair production .",
    "pair production can not be avoided if energies of two colliding photons @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( in units of @xmath54 ) satisfy the relation @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the cosine of the angle between the two photons , and @xmath59 is the velocity of the positrons and electrons in the center of momentum frame in the units of @xmath10 .",
    "the optical depth of the radiation field to tev photons can be obtained by integrating over the radius @xmath60 along the propagation path of the tev photons to infinity and direction of incident soft photons , i.e. , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the cross section of the two colliding photons ( gould & schrder 1967 ) , @xmath63 is the threshold energy of the interacting photons and @xmath64 is the outer radius of the adaf .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath65 strongly depends on the incident angle between the two photons .    the dependence of @xmath65 on @xmath20 ( and thus the smbh spin ) can be qualitatively predicted . for a given bolometric luminosity ,",
    "most of the gravitational energy dissipated during accretion onto a rapidly black hole is released in a more compact region than in a system containing a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this leads to a much steeper @xmath66 relation around the kerr black hole horizon and facilitates the escape of tev photons from considerable smaller radii .",
    "it is thus expected that the timing information from tev photons can be used as a diagnostic of the spatial distributions of the soft photon field surrounding the smbh and thus its spin .",

    "@xmath65 is sensitive to radii , but not to the viewing angle . as we argue qualitatively , fig .",
    "4 shows that the @xmath66 relation is much steeper for kerr holes than the schwarzschild . for tev photons to be able to escape from the radiation field of the adaf",
    ", we require @xmath68 .",
    "we define the transparent radius , @xmath69 , as the radius at which @xmath70 .",
    "we find @xmath71 and @xmath72 for kerr and schwarzschild black holes , respectively .",
    "the tev variability timescale in m87 , observed by hess , is of @xmath73days , implying a compact emission region of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the doppler factor and @xmath76^{-1/2}$ ] the lorentz factor of a jet with a velocity of @xmath77 . if the jet is viewed at @xmath78 ( bicknell & begelman 1996 ; aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ) , the maximum doppler factor is @xmath79 .",
    "even if the tev photons are emitted from the base of the relativistic jet , we have @xmath80 , where @xmath81 . on the necessary condition of @xmath82 , the hess observations suggest the presence of a rapidly rotating black hole in m87 in term of @xmath83 for a schwarzschild hole .",
    "otherwise , the observed tev region would be optical thick to 10tev .",
    "increasing the black hole spin , @xmath84 , the transparent radius @xmath69 decreases . in order for the transparent radius to equal the tev emission radius , we require a black hole spin of @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "we note that the x - ray spectrum can not be well fit with @xmath87 and @xmath86 , however we show the sed in figs 1 and 4 to demonstrate how sensitive the transparent radius and the sed are to black hole spin .",
    "fig 4 shows a region between @xmath88 , in which the exact spins should be , most likely have the maximum spin if the tev region has a radius of @xmath89 .",
    "we note that although the @xmath66 relation becomes steeper with spin , @xmath90 is in fact insensitive to spins of @xmath91 , making this technique less useful for estimation of their spins in slowly rotating black holes .",
    "the absence of any evidence for a potential break between @xmath92tev means @xmath93 for these tev photons , namely the spin @xmath94 .",
    "otherwise , at @xmath95 for a schwarzschild hole , @xmath96 and the tev photons will be attenuated by a factor of @xmath97 .",
    "this strongly conflicts with results from the tev observations .",
    "the conclusion does , however , depend on the fitting of the multiwavelength continuum , which could be contaminated by other sources , for example , the inner jet .",
    "the current data and model do not allow us to constrain the spin to better than @xmath98 , however , future improved multiwavelength data and models will produce tighter constraints on how fast the spin is .",
    "a rapid rotation is generally consistent with the statistic results from the sloan digital sky survey ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ) and with justification from radio emission in term of blandford - znajek effect ( newman et al .",
    "since smbh growth is primarily accretion , the spin angular momentum of the black hole is likely to be dominated by its accretion history .",
    "if the accretion is random , however , as suggested by king & pringle ( 2007 ) , the net spins of smbhs should tend to zero .",
    "the spin evolution of smbhs will thus uncover the accretion modes ( co - rotating , retrograde or random accretion ) in their history from measuring spins of local smbhs .",
    "the tev variability as a new independent ingredient allows us to disentangle the inner radius from other parameters in modeling the multiwavelength continuum .",
    "we fit the multiwavelength continuum of m87 and use the best - fit parameters of the adaf to calculate the optical depth of the adaf radiation field to tev photons .",
    "this optical depth is sensitive to the spin of smbhs and combined with the tev variability constraints , we conclude that the smbh must be rapidly rotating in m87 .",
    "whatever mechanism produces the tev photons in m87 , these energetic photons provide a potentially powerful probe of the smbh spin .",
    "we should note some uncertainties of the present results , which fully depends on the theoretical model of adaf , and contamination of the radiation in the central region from its host and jet .",
    "the influence of potential outflows from the adaf should be examined in a future paper .",
    "although we neglect the gr effects and the global structure of the adaf in this paper for simplicity , the addition of the effects will make the conclusion of this work robust , because the gravitational energy is dissipated in more compact regions due to the deeper gravitational potential than in the newtonian case .",
    "the resulting @xmath66 relation will then be steeper , reducing the transparent radius from which tev photons can escape .",
    "accurate measurements of the black hole spin rely on global calculations of the adaf with general relativity and the timescale measurements of tev variability to confine the dimensions of the tev region .",
    "future observations of other sources with hess may reveal similar tev variability to m87 , particularly in low luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ) , such as radio galaxies and low ionization nuclear emission regions ( liners ) .",
    "this would lead to further estimates of the spins of smbhs in nearby galaxies .",
    "additionally , the present results suggest that any mechanism responsible for production of the tev photons should be located outside a region with @xmath99 , constraining on the radiation mechanism of tev photons .",
