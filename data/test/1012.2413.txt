    "in a recent article @xcite the following conjecture was formulated :    [ c:1 ] consider an asymptotically flat , vacuum , complete axially symmetric initial data set for einstein equations .",
    "then the following inequality holds @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the area and angular momentum of a connected component of the apparent horizon .",
    "see @xcite for a physical interpretation and motivation of the inequality . in that article",
    "evidences for the validity of conjecture [ c:1 ] were presented .",
    "these evidences are the following : in a particular class of initial data set , called extreme throat initial data , the first variation of the area , with fixed angular momentum , is zero and the second variation is positive definite evaluated at the extreme kerr throat initial data .",
    "this indicates that the area of the extreme kerr throat initial data is a minimum among this class of data .",
    "since extreme kerr initial data satisfy the equality in ( [ eq:1 ] ) it follows that the area of generic throat initial data satisfies ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "the key ingredient for this analysis is a formula that relates the variations of the area of extreme throat initial data with the variation of an appropriately defined mass functional .",
    "however , as it was pointed out in @xcite , in order to use these arguments to prove conjecture [ c:1 ] , there are two main points that need to be addressed .",
    "the first one is the following .",
    "it is well known that a non - negative second variation is a necessary condition for a local minimum but it is not sufficient . to prove that extreme kerr is a local minimum it is necessary to provide extra estimates in a similar way as in @xcite .",
    "as remarked in @xcite it is expected that the same analysis will apply to this case also .",
    "however , to prove that extreme kerr is a global minimum ( which is , of course , what we need to prove ) a different ingredient is needed , since it is a priori not clear how to relate the area and the mass functional mentioned above far from the extreme kerr solution .",
    "the second point is how to extend the result on extreme throat initial data to include the physically relevant asymptotically flat black hole initial data mentioned in the conjecture . in @xcite",
    "a limit procedure was proposed which could in principle reduce the general case to the extreme throat case .",
    "this limit procedure is similar in spirit to the extreme limit of the kerr black hole initial data .",
    "however , it is far from clear how to construct this limit in general",
    ". a natural candidate would be initial data which are close to kerr .",
    "even for that class of data the construction appears to be difficult .",
    "the purpose of this article is to address the two points mentioned above .",
    "for the first one we give a complete and optimal answer , namely , we prove that extreme kerr throat initial data are a global minimum in this class . at the core of our argument lies a remarkable inequality that relates the area and the mass functional for extreme throat initial data .",
    "this inequality is the global generalization of the local arguments presented in @xcite .    for the second point",
    "we give a partial answer .",
    "we prove the conjecture for a class of initial data which has several technical restrictions .",
    "however , despite of that , this class is relevant by itself .",
    "it includes initial data which have an isometry that leaves fixed a two - dimensional surface .",
    "this kind of data can describe distorted rotating black holes far from equilibrium .",
    "they have been extensively used in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the well known bowen - york family of initial data @xcite is a particular case , where the metric is conformally flat .",
    "our proof does not rely on a limit procedure .",
    "remarkable enough , it is a pure local argument , which uses the mass formula to estimate in a simple fashion the area of the minimal surface .    finally , we extend the validity of conjecture [ c:1 ] to include a non - negative cosmological constant ( and hence non - asymptotically flat initial data ) .",
    "this generalization is relevant because there exists a counter - example of inequality ( [ eq:1 ] ) for the case of negative cosmological constant , as it was pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it will be seen that the inclusion of the cosmological constant stresses the role of a non - negative ricci scalar .",
    "the plan of the article is the following . in section",
    "[ main ] we present our main result , given by theorem [ teobh ] .",
    "we also discuss the scope of the theorem and analyze relevant examples .",
    "the proof of this result consists of two main parts , explained in sections [ secarea ] and [ massminimum ] .",
    "the main result of section [ secarea ] is an estimate for the area in terms of the mass functional . in section [ massminimum ]",
    "we present a variational argument that asserts that the global minimum of the mass functional is given by the extreme throat kerr initial data .",
    "an initial data set for einstein equations , with cosmological constant @xmath3 , consists in a riemannian 3-manifold @xmath4 , together with its first and second fundamental forms , @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , which satisfy the vacuum einstein constraints on @xmath4 @xmath7 in these equations , @xmath8 , the ricci scalar @xmath9 , the contractions and covariant derivatives are computed with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "the presence of the cosmological constant @xmath3 allows for non asymptotically flat data describing initial data of de sitter ( @xmath10 ) or anti - de sitter ( @xmath11 ) type .",
    "when the initial data are maximal ( i.e. @xmath12 ) the constraint equations simplify considerably .",
    "in particular , when @xmath13 , the scalar curvature @xmath9 is non - negative .",
    "the condition @xmath14 plays a crucial role in this article .",
    "the initial data are axially symmetric if there exists an axial killing vector field @xmath15 such that @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the lie derivative .",
    "the cauchy development of such initial data will be an axially symmetric spacetime .",
    "for an axially symmetric metric , it is always possible @xcite to choose local coordinates ( @xmath18 ) such that @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are regular functions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in these coordinates ,",
    "the killing vector is given by @xmath24 and its square norm is @xmath25 the regularity conditions on the metric @xmath26 at the axis imply that @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the polar axis @xmath29 .",
    "the twist potential @xmath30 of the spacetime axial killing field can be computed in terms of the second fundamental form @xmath6 as follows ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "define the vector @xmath31 by @xmath32 then , define @xmath33 by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the volume element with respect to the flat metric . in virtue of the constraint equations ,",
    "the vector @xmath33 is the gradient of a scalar field which is the twist potential , namely @xmath36    in this work , we will study the geometry of the 2-surfaces @xmath37",
    ". for these surfaces there exist two relevant quantities .",
    "the first one is the angular momentum , which for such surfaces is defined by @xmath38 see @xcite for a detailed discussion about angular momentum in axial symmetry .",
    "the second quantity is the area of the surface .",
    "the induced 2-metric on such surfaces is @xmath39,\\ ] ] and , remarkably , its determinant does not depend on @xmath21 or @xmath40 , @xmath41 then , the area of the surface @xmath37 is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the surface element on the unit 2-sphere and in the last equality we have made use of axial symmetry .",
    "another useful geometrical quantity is the second fundamental form @xmath44 of the surface given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the unit normal to the surface .",
    "the mean curvature of the surface is an important concept in what follows and reads @xmath47    the mean curvature @xmath48 is related with the radial derivatives of the area @xmath1 as follows . for the first derivative we have @xmath49 and for the second derivative , @xmath50 \\,ds.\\ ] ] the case @xmath51 will be relevant for our purposes . for that case",
    "we have @xmath52    the following theorem constitutes the main result of the present work .",
    "[ teobh ] consider axisymmetric , vacuum and maximal initial data , with a non - negative cosmological constant as described above .",
    "assume there exists a surface @xmath53 where the following local conditions are satisfied@xmath54 then we have @xmath55 where @xmath1 is the area and @xmath2 the angular momentum of @xmath56 .",
    "let us discuss the hypothesis of this theorem .",
    "the theorem is a pure local result , in particular there are no conditions on the asymptotics of the initial data .",
    "we have also introduced the cosmological constant , generalizing in this way the validity of conjecture [ c:1 ] .",
    "as we mention in the introduction , in @xcite it has been presented a counter example to inequality ( [ eq:1 ] ) with negative cosmological constant .",
    "maximal data with non - negative cosmological constant ( as required in the hypothesis of the theorem ) have non - negative ricci scalar .",
    "this is the crucial property that allows us to prove ( [ desigualdad ] ) .",
    "the first important restriction of the theorem is that only surfaces @xmath37 are allowed . in the general case ,",
    "the horizon mentioned in the conjecture will not be such a surface . this particular choice of foliation adapted to the cylindrical coordinates simplifies considerably the estimates .",
    "a relevant open problem is how to extend these results to include general surfaces .    by equations and",
    ", we deduce that conditions and imply that the area of the surface @xmath56 is a local minimum .",
    "that is , @xmath56 is a minimal surface .. in this article , we use the term extremal for such surface , and reserve the term minimal for surfaces which in addition are area minimizing . ]",
    "if these were the only hypothesis in the theorem , then conjecture [ c:1 ] would be proved for initial data having a global minimal surface @xmath37 : by definition , the area of such minimal surface is less than or equal to the area of any surface , the horizon in particular .",
    "however , in order to prove the inequality we require the extra condition .",
    "this is a technical condition which we do not expect to be necessary .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that this is also a geometrical condition , since it can be written in terms of @xmath48 and the component @xmath57 of the extrinsic curvature @xmath44 of @xmath56 , namely @xmath58 this result can be seen in the following way @xmath59 but the first term in the last expression is zero because @xmath15 and @xmath60 are orthogonal .",
    "then @xmath61 since @xmath15 is a killing vector field .",
    "finally we have @xmath62 where , in the second equality , we have made use of axial symmetry .",
    "therefore , @xmath63 together with @xmath51 , imply @xmath64 ( see equation ) .",
    "this alternative way of writing the hypotheses of theorem [ teobh ] gives a more geometrical description of the surface considered .",
    "in particular , totally geodesic surfaces ( i.e. surfaces such that @xmath65 ) satisfy and .",
    "moreover , when @xmath66 , condition implies that @xmath56 is totally geodesic .",
    "there exists a particularly relevant class of initial data that satisfies all conditions imposed in theorem [ teobh ] .",
    "namely , initial data with an isometry that leaves the surface @xmath56 invariant .",
    "this isometry is also called `` inversion through the throat '' in the literature .",
    "let us discuss this family of examples in more detail .",
    "in @xcite it has been proven that a compact 2-surface that is invariant under an isometry is a totally geodesic surface .",
    "note that the isometry only imposes conditions on the first order derivatives of the initial data functions evaluated at the invariant surface @xmath56 .",
    "condition ( [ cond2 ] ) , which is a condition on the second derivatives of the metric , is not automatically satisfied . in fact , a surface could be a local maximum and still be invariant under the isometry .",
    "however , for a rich class of data this surface is a global minimum . to analyze this point",
    "it is better to discuss concrete examples .",
    "a canonical example of this kind of isometric data is a slice @xmath67 ( in the standard boyer - lindquist coordinates ) of the non - extreme kerr black hole .",
    "the geometry of these data ( which is the same as the schwarzschild black hole ) is the well known picture shown in figure [ fig : isometry - initial - data ] .",
    "the global minimal surface that connects the two sheets satisfies all the hypothesis of the theorem . in this case",
    "the minimal surface coincides with the apparent horizon .",
    "the kerr black hole initial data constitute a non - trivial example of the theorem .",
    "although inequality can be of course computed explicitly for kerr , the theorem presents an alternative proof of it .    for more general black hole",
    "initial data , isometry conditions were introduced in @xcite and since then they have been extensively used to construct initial data for black hole numerical simulations .",
    "a well known example is the conformally flat ( i.e. @xmath68 ) family of black hole initial data introduced by bowen and york @xcite .",
    "another conformally flat case was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "non - conformally flat examples have been studied in @xcite . in all these examples",
    "black hole initial data with the geometry shown in figure [ fig : isometry - initial - data ] have been constructed .",
    "these data represent distorted black holes and can , in principle , be far from equilibrium . however , it is important to emphasize that in order for the isometry invariant surface @xmath56 to remain a global minimum of the area the distortion should not produce extra minimal surfaces , as in the case shown in figure [ fig : multiple - minimal - surfaces ] . in that case",
    "the theorem still applies for the surface @xmath56 but since it is does not give the global minimum of the area , we can not prove the conjecture .",
    "conditions ensuring that the isometry surface gives a minimum for the area have been studied for some examples in @xcite .",
    "there exists also a lot of numerical evidence for all these examples showing that if the distortion from kerr is not too severe , then the isometry surface gives in fact a global minimum for the area ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in many of these examples the horizon and the minimal surface do not coincide @xcite .",
    "also , this kind of isometry data can represent binary black hole initial data ( this is in fact one of the main applications of these data , see @xcite , @xcite ) ) . in the case of binary black holes ,",
    "there exist two minimal surfaces which are invariant under the isometry .",
    "remarkable enough , these surfaces also satisfy conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) , ( [ cond2 ] ) and ( [ cond3 ] ) .",
    "but they are not @xmath37 surfaces , and hence the theorem does not apply to them .",
    "it is also important to mention that the isometry condition is preserved under the evolution ( in fact it has been explicitly used for numerical evolution , see @xcite ) and hence it can play a useful role in the analytical study of the black hole stability problem for this kind of data .",
    "we summarize the above discussion in the following corollary .",
    "consider axisymmetric , vacuum and maximal initial data , with a non - negative cosmological constant as described above .",
    "assume there exists an isometry which leaves fixed a surface @xmath53 .",
    "assume also that the area of this surface is a global minimum .",
    "then conjecture [ c:1 ] is proven for these data .",
    "is proven for this kind of data .",

    "these are the extreme throat initial data introduced in @xcite .",
    "this kind of data is a special case of axially symmetric data discussed above where an additional symmetry is present . in order to introduce them , it is convenient to make the change of coordinates @xmath69 to the metric .",
    "we also define the function @xmath70 by @xmath71 then , the line element is written as @xmath72.\\ ] ] assume that @xmath70 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath21 do not depend on @xmath75 , then @xmath76 is a killing vector of @xmath26 ( besides @xmath77 ) .",
    "if also @xmath78 then we call @xmath79 an extreme throat initial data set .",
    "the geometry of these data is cylindrical ( see figure [ fig : cylinder - initial - data ] ) , as @xmath4 is @xmath80 and the sections @xmath81 are topological spheres which are isometric to each other .        for these data",
    "the twist potential @xmath30 is defined in the same way as done for general axially symmetric data , and now it is a function that depends only on @xmath23 . as the data are symmetric with respect to translations in the @xmath75 direction ,",
    "the angular momentum and area associated with these data do not depend on @xmath75 .",
    "they are given by @xmath82 @xmath83 which are the corresponding expressions to and .",
    "a particularly relevant functional for this class of data is the mass functional @xmath84 , defined as ( see @xcite ) @xmath85 this functional plays a fundamental role in the proof of theorem [ teobh ] and has two important properties .",
    "the first one is that it is possible to relate it with the area @xmath1 .",
    "the second property is that it is essentially equivalent to the energy of an harmonic map .",
    "both properties will constitute the core of the proof of theorem [ teobh ] , they will be explained in sections [ secarea ] and [ massminimum ] respectively .    note that by the non - dependence on @xmath75 ( and hence on @xmath22 ) of the functions , conditions , and are satisfied for extreme throat initial data .",
    "hence we have the following corollary of theorem [ teobh ] .    [ teocil ] for an extreme throat initial data set the inequality @xmath86 holds , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the area and angular momentum of the data given by and .",
    "this corollary significantly extends the results presented in @xcite in two directions .",
    "first , it applies to general extreme throat initial data .",
    "the killing vector @xmath76 is not required to be hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "in fact , the result applies to a slightly more general class of data , the only condition required is that the functions @xmath70 , @xmath73 and @xmath30 do not depend on @xmath75 . but",
    "no condition is imposed on @xmath74 and @xmath21 .",
    "these functions could depend on @xmath75 , in that case the data will not admit the killing field @xmath76 but the corollary will still hold .",
    "the second extension with respect to @xcite is that this is a global result and not a local one . as we mentioned in the introduction , to prove this result we will use a remarkable inequality relating the area and the mass functional .",
    "this is explained in section [ secarea ] .",
    "the importance of extreme throat initial data resides on that they naturally appear as the limit geometry of initial data with a cylindrical end .",
    "the canonical example of these data is the extreme kerr black hole initial data .",
    "see figure [ fig : cylindrical - end - initial - data ] for a representation of the geometry of these data . at the cylindrical end ,",
    "all the derivatives with respect to @xmath22 of the relevant functions decay to zero , but not the functions themselves .",
    "they have a well defined limit .",
    "these limit functions define extreme throat initial data ( for the details of this construction see @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , the previous corollary applies to the limit area of the cylindrical end of extreme black hole initial data .",
    "this limit area is not directly related with conjecture [ c:1 ] because it is not a horizon .",
    "but it still has interesting applications .",
    "extreme kerr is of course an example , where the equality holds .",
    "but there are also other examples as the ones constructed in @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .        finally , we present the proof of theorem [ teobh ] .",
    "the proof is divided into two main parts described in sections [ secarea ] and [ massminimum ] .",
    "first we obtain an inequality relating the area with the mass functional .",
    "this is given by lemma [ lema2 ] .",
    "here , we have made use of hypothesis ( [ cond1 ] ) , ( [ cond2 ] ) and ( [ cond3 ] ) .",
    "then , using lemma [ lemma:2 ] we bound the mass functional by the angular momentum and we obtain the desired result .",
    "the purpose of this section is to get a lower bound on the area @xmath1 of the surface @xmath56 mentioned in theorem [ teobh ] in terms of the mass functional .",
    "all the calculations that follow are local , no asymptotic behavior being assumed .    the hamiltonian equation , together with the maximality condition , @xmath12 , give @xmath87 in @xcite it has been proven that @xmath88 where @xmath30 is the twist potential introduced in . by inserting in and using the condition @xmath89 , one gets the bound @xmath90 the ricci scalar @xmath9 in terms of the metric functions @xmath91 , @xmath73 , @xmath40 and @xmath21 is @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the flat laplace operators in three and two dimensions respectively , and @xmath95 denotes partial derivatives . from and we finally obtain @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the laplace operator on @xmath98 acting on axially symmetric functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 now we integrate in the unit 2-sphere . using @xmath101 and ( see @xcite ) @xmath102 we obtain @xmath103 where we have defined @xmath104 in order to make contact with the mass functional @xmath105 , we write the left hand side of inequality in terms of @xmath70 , defined in , @xmath106 adding up a term of the form @xmath107 to both sides of we obtain an upper bound for @xmath105 , @xmath108 this is more conveniently written as @xmath109 where we have integrated the right hand side over @xmath110 . for our purposes",
    "later , it is useful to exponentiate the above inequality @xmath111    we want to remark that in going from to there appears to be an inconsistency concerning units .",
    "nevertheless , since in the end we take the exponential of that inequality , the final result , , has the right dimension of area .",
    "we want to use this inequality to bound the area of the surfaces @xmath37 .",

    "a crucial property of the functional @xmath133 is that it is closely related to the energy associated with a particular harmonic map . to see this ,",
    "let us restrict the domain of integration in , defining @xmath134 where @xmath135 , such that @xmath136 does not include the poles , and consider the functional @xmath137 the relation between @xmath138 and @xmath139 is given by @xmath140 where @xmath141 denotes the exterior normal to @xmath136 and @xmath142 is the surface element on the boundary @xmath143 .",

    "relation will be central in the proof that the global minimum of @xmath133 is attained by extreme kerr throat initial data .",

    "it is important to remark that the condition @xmath150 for @xmath151 is automatically satisfied for smooth initial data , as a consequence of the regularity at the axis .",
    "the proof follows similar arguments as those used in @xcite and @xcite .    the core of the proof is the use of a theorem due to hildebrandt , kaul and widman @xcite for harmonic maps .",
    "in that work it is shown that if the domain for the map is compact , connected , with nonvoid boundary and the target manifold has negative sectional curvature , then minimizers of the harmonic energy with dirichlet boundary conditions exist , are smooth , and satisfy the associated euler - lagrange equations .",
    "that is , harmonic maps are minimizers of the harmonic energy for given dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "also , solutions of the dirichlet boundary value problem are unique when the target manifold has negative sectional curvature .",
    "therefore , we want to use the relation between @xmath84 and the harmonic energy @xmath144 in order to prove that minimizers of @xmath144 are also minimizers of @xmath84 .",
    "there are two main difficulties in doing this .",
    "first , the harmonic energy @xmath144 is not defined for the functions that we are considering if the domain of integration includes the poles .",
    "second , we are not dealing with a dirichlet problem . to overcome this difficulties the sphere is split in three regions according to figure [ regions ] .",
    "the extent of the different regions depend on a chosen positive constant @xmath153 , in such a way that when @xmath153 goes to zero regions @xmath154 and @xmath155 shrink towards the poles , while region @xmath156 extends towards covering the sphere .",
    "then a partition function is used to interpolate between extreme kerr throat initial data in region @xmath154 and general extreme throat initial data in region @xmath156 , constructing auxiliary interpolating data .",
    "this solves the two difficulties in the sense that now the dirichlet problem on region @xmath157 can be considered , and the harmonic energy is well defined for this domain of integration .",
    "this allows us to show that the mass functional for kerr data is less than or equal to the mass functional for the auxiliary interpolating data in the hole sphere .",
    "the final step is to show that as @xmath153 goes to zero the mass functional for the auxiliary data converges to the mass functional for the original general data .",
    "there is a subtlety in this step .",
    "namely , the partition function needs to have been chosen suitably in order for the convergence to be possible .        the partition function that will be used and the extension of the regions in which the sphere is",

    "therefore we start presenting the partition function , taken from @xcite , lemma 3.1 , and then define the different regions on the sphere .",
    "so , let @xmath158 be a cut off function such that @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 for @xmath162 , @xmath163 for @xmath164 and @xmath165 . for given @xmath166 define @xmath167 and @xmath168 then @xmath169 defines a smooth function for @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( the function is trivially extended to be @xmath172 when @xmath173 ) .",
    "also , @xmath174 for @xmath175 and @xmath176 for @xmath177 , so it has all the properties of a partition function .",
    "of particular importance for us is that @xmath169 has the following property , @xmath178    accordingly to the definition of @xmath169 we define the following regions on the sphere @xmath179    now we can define the interpolating functions . for this , let @xmath180 represent any of @xmath181 , the general data , and let @xmath182 represent any of @xmath183 , corresponding to the extreme kerr throat data with the same angular momentum @xmath2 of @xmath30 .",
    "we define @xmath184 to be @xmath185 this gives @xmath186 and @xmath187 as desired .",
    "we also define the mass functional for these functions @xmath188 and correspondingly @xmath189 and @xmath190 when the domain of integration is restricted to some region @xmath136 or when we are considering the harmonic energy for the given map .",
    "we also denote by a superscript ` @xmath123 ' these quantities calculated for @xmath182 .",
    "we have all the ingredients needed to make use of the result of @xcite . for this ,",
    "let us consider now a fixed value of @xmath153 , and the functions @xmath181 on the set @xmath191 .",
    "by @xcite we know that there exists one and only one function that minimizes @xmath144 on @xmath191 for given boundary data , and that this function satisfies the euler - lagrange equations of @xmath144 on @xmath191 . by construction of @xmath184 we have that @xmath184 and @xmath182 have the same boundary values on @xmath191 , @xmath192 as we already know that @xmath182 is a solution of the euler - lagrange equations of @xmath144 there , then @xmath182 is the only minimizer of @xmath144 on @xmath191 with these boundary conditions . with respect to @xmath184",
    "this means that @xmath193 both @xmath84 and @xmath144 are well defined on @xmath191 , and by their difference is just a constant .",
    "this allows us to use to get that @xmath194 as we have already noted , @xmath195 , and therefore @xmath196 .",
    "this together with and the fact that @xmath197 gives @xmath198    only the last step of the proof is lacking , that is , to show that @xmath199 to do this we start by splitting the integral in according to the different domains of integration @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "from the definition of @xmath184 we have @xmath200 and in particular @xmath201 and @xmath202",
    ". then @xmath203 the first and third integrals are not hard to deal with . as @xmath204 is finite , and as @xmath154 shrinks to a point as @xmath153 goes to zero , then @xmath205=0\\ ] ] by the lebesgue - dominated convergence theorem .",
    "also , as @xmath84 is finite , and as @xmath156 extends to cover @xmath98 as @xmath153 goes to zero , then by the dominated convergence theorem we have that @xmath206=\\\\ & & \\hspace{2cm}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{s^2}\\left(|d\\varsigma|^2 + 4\\varsigma+\\frac{|d\\omega|^2}{e^{2\\varsigma}\\sin^4\\theta}\\right)ds={\\cal m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as can be expected , the integral over @xmath155 is more tricky and we need to consider its different parts separately . using the definition of @xmath184 we have that @xmath207 .",
    "therefore @xmath208 and by the lebesgue - dominated convergence theorem @xmath209 so we get that @xmath210    from we have @xmath211 then @xmath212 for the first term in this gives @xmath213 the last two terms in the integral above converge to zero when @xmath153 goes to zero by the lebesgue - dominated convergence theorem as @xmath133 and @xmath214 are finite .",
    "for the first term we have @xmath215 making the change of variable @xmath216 and integrating over the @xmath110 variable we have that @xmath217 here is where the important property is used , together with , and gives @xmath218    the last integral that needs consideration is @xmath219 as @xmath70 and @xmath220 are bounded , then also is @xmath221 and therefore there exists a constant @xmath222 such that @xmath223 , and then using @xmath224 as before , the last two terms in the integral converge to zero when @xmath153 goes to zero by the lebesgue - dominated convergence theorem as @xmath133 and @xmath214 are finite .",
    "for the first term we use the hypothesis @xmath225 and the fact that by construction @xmath226 . making a taylor expansion of @xmath30",
    ", what we have just said translates into @xmath227 near the axis .",
    "this means that @xmath228 is bounded , and together with and we conclude that @xmath229 this completes the proof of and with the proof of the lemma .",
