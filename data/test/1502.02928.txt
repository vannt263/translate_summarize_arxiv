    ", we see that the nuclear physics aspects ( reflecting the accuracy of the required @xmath0-nucleus cross sections ) , appreciably affect the coherent @xmath37 transition rate , a result especially useful for supernova @xmath0-detection probes .    in the present work ,",

    "however , since coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering can probe the neutron nuclear form factors , methods like the bcs provide more reliable results .    in view of the operation of extremely intensive neutrino fluxes ( at the sns , psi , j - parc , fermilab , etc .",

    "<S> open neutrino physics issues require precision studies , both theoretical and experimental ones , and towards this aim coherent neutral current neutrino - nucleus scattering events are expected to be observed soon . in this work , we explore @xmath0-nucleus processes from a nuclear theory point of view and obtain results with high confidence level based on accurate nuclear structure cross sections calculations . besides cross sections , </S>",
    "<S> the present study includes simulated signals expected to be recorded by nuclear detectors , differential event rates as well as total number of events predicted to be measured . </S>",
    "<S> our original cross sections calculations are focused on measurable rates for the standard model process , but we also perform calculations for various channels of the non - standard neutrino - nucleus reactions and come out with promising results within the current upper limits of the corresponding exotic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the possibility of detecting ( i ) supernova neutrinos by using massive detectors like those of the gerda and supercdms dark matter experiments and ( ii ) laboratory neutrinos produced near the spallation neutron source facilities ( at oak ridge national lab ) by the coherent experiment . </S>",
    "<S> our nuclear calculations take advantage of the relevant experimental sensitivity and employ the severe bounds extracted for the exotic parameters entering the lagrangians of various particle physics models and specifically those resulting from the charged lepton flavour violating @xmath1 experiments ( mu2e and comet experiments ) . </S>"
