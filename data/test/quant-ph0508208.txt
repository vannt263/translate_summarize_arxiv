    "entanglement , an essential feature of the quantum mechanics , has been introduced in many fields of physics . in the field of quantum information , the entanglement has played a key role .",
    "the study of entanglement properties in many - body systems have attracted much attention  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the heisenberg chains , widely studied in the condensed matter field , display rich entanglement features and have many useful applications such as in the quantum state transfer  @xcite .",
    "most of the systems considered in previous studies are spin - half systems as there exists a good measure of entanglement of two spin - halves , the concurrence  @xcite , which is applicable to an arbitrary state of two spin halves . on the other hand ,",
    "the entanglements in mixed - spin or higher spin systems are not well - studied due to the lack of good operational entanglement measures .",
    "there are several initial studies along this direction  @xcite , however these works are restricted to the case of two particles .",
    "for the case of higher spins , a non - entangled state has necessarily a positive partial transpose according to the peres - horodecki criterion  @xcite . in the case of two spin halves , and the case of ( 1/2,1 )",
    "mixed spins , fortunately , a positive partial transpose is also sufficient .",
    "thus , the sufficient and necessary condition for entangled state in ( 1/2,1 ) mixed spin systems is that it has a negative partial transpose .",
    "this allows us to investigate entanglement features of the mixed spin system .",
    "the peres - horodecki criterion give a qualitative way for judging whether the state is entangled or not .",
    "the quantitative version of the criterion was developed by vidal and werner  @xcite .",
    "they presented a measure of entanglement called negativity that can be computed efficiently , and the negativity does not increase under local manipulations of the system . the negativity of a state @xmath0 is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the negative eigenvalue of @xmath3 , and @xmath4 denotes + the partial transpose with respect to the first system . the negativity @xmath5 is related to the trace norm of @xmath3 via @xmath6 where the trace norm of @xmath3 is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of @xmath3 . in this paper , we will use the concept of negativity to study entanglement in ( 1/2,1 ) mixed - spin systems .    as shown in most previous works , models with the nn exchange interactions",
    "are considered and it is not easy to have pairwise entanglement between the nnn spins  @xcite .",
    "it is true that there exist some quasi - one - dimension compounds offering us systems with nnn interactions .",
    "bose and chattopadhyay  @xcite and gu et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated entanglement in spin - half heisenberg chain with nnn interactions . in our paper here , we study entanglement properties not only in the ( 1/2,1 ) mixed - spin systems only with nn interactions , but also in the system with nnn interactions .",
    "entanglement in a system with a few spins displays general features of entanglement with more spins .",
    "for instance , in the anisotropic heisenberg model with a large number of qubits , the pairwise entanglement shows a maximum at the isotropic point  @xcite .",
    "this feature was already shown in a small system with four or five qubits  @xcite .",
    "so , the study of small systems is meaningful in the study of entanglement as they may reflect general features of larger or macroscopic systems .",
    "also , due to the limitation of our computation capability , we only concentrate on small systems such as 4 , 5 and 6-spin models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we study the systems with only nn interactions",
    ". the analytical results of negativity for the cases of two and three spins are given .",
    "the relation between entanglement and the macroscopic thermodynamical function , the internal energy is revealed . also we numerically compute the negativity in more general mixed - spin models up to eight spins , and consider the effects of magnetic fields in this section . in sec .",
    "iii , the system with nnn interaction is discussed .",
    "for the four - spin case , we analytically calculate the eigenenergy of the system from which we get the analytical results of the negativity of the nn spins .",
    "we numerically study negativities versus nnn exchanging coupling , and the case of finite temperature is also considered . for larger system up to eight - spin system , we get some numerical results . the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "we study entanglement of states of the system at thermal equilibrium described by the density operator @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the boltzmann s constant , which is assumed to be one throughout the paper , and @xmath10 is the partition function .",
    "the entanglement in the thermal state is called thermal entanglement .",
    "we consider two kinds of spins , spin @xmath11 and @xmath12 , alternating on a ring with antiferromagnetic exchange coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are spin-1/2 and spin-1 operators , respectively .",
    "the exchange interactions exist only between nearest neighbors , and they are of the same strength which are set to one .",
    "we adopt the periodic boundary condition . in fig .  1 , we give the schematic representation of the above hamiltonian .",
    "next , we first consider the models with two and three spins , and aim at getting analytical results of entanglement .      for the two - spin case , the hamiltonian  ( [ h01 ] ) reduces to @xmath16 .",
    "to have a matrix representation of the hamiltonian , we choose the following basis @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the eigenstate of @xmath19 and @xmath20 with the corresponding eigenvalues given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .        in the above basis",
    ", the hamiltonian can be written as a block - diagonal form with the dimension of each block being at most @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the density matrix @xmath24 for the thermal state is obtained as @xmath25 with the partition function and the matrix elements given by @xmath26 after the partial transpose with respect to the first spin - half subsystem , we can get @xmath27 @xmath28 which is still of the block - diagonal form , and computation of its eigenvalues is straightforward .",
    "there are only two eigenvalues which are possibly negative . the negativity is thus given by @xmath29\\nonumber\\\\ + & \\frac{1}2\\max\\big[0,\\sqrt{(a_5-a_6)^2 + 4b_1 ^ 2}-a_5-a_6\\big].\\label{n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    substituting eqs .",

    "( [ n1 ] ) , it is direct to check that the negativity is a monotonically decreasing function when temperature increases . after a certain threshold value of the temperature , the entanglement disappears .",
    "this threshold value @xmath33 can be obtained as @xmath34 for a ring of spin - half particles interacting via the hisenberg hamiltonian , it was shown that the pairwise thermal entanglement is determined by the internal energy  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask if similar relations exist in the present mixed - spin system .",

    "@xcite by the group - theoretical technique .",
    "we now consider the three - spin case and the schematic representation of the corresponding hamiltonian is given by fig .  1 .",
    "in this situation , there are two types of pairwise entanglement , the entanglement between spin 1/2 and spin 1 and the entanglement between two spin halves .",
    "the eigenvalue problem can be solved analytically , and after tracing out the third spin - half system the reduced density matrix @xmath24 is still of the same form as in eq .",

    ". the equation above can be obtained from the non - degenerate ground state given by : @xmath58 it is interesting to see that the ground - state entanglement between the spin half and spin 1 in the three - spin case is the same as that in the two - spin case .    due to the su(2 ) symmetry in our system ,",
    "there are following relations between correlation functions and negativities  @xcite @xmath59 where we have removed the max function in the negativity , implying that the negative value of @xmath5 indicates no entanglement .",
    "then , we have the relation between the internal energy and the negativities @xmath60 the second equality follows from the exchange symmetry , namely , the hamiltonian is invariant when exchanging two spin halves .",
    "so , for the three - spin case , the internal energy is related to two negativities .    to apply the above result , we consider the the ground - state properties ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath62.\\ ] ] then , by the angular momentum coupling theory , the ground - state energy is obtained as @xmath63 . substituting the ground - state energy and @xmath64 to eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) , we obtain @xmath65 , indicating that there exists no entanglement between two spin halves .",
    "next , we consider more general situations , i.e. , the case of even @xmath66 sites .      except for the su(2 )",
    "symmetry in the system , there exists exchange symmetry for the case of even spins .",
    "for instance , in the four - spin model , the hamiltonian is invariant when exchanging two spin halves or two spin ones .",
    "thus , for even - spin model , the entanglements between the two nearest - neighbor spins and the correlation functions @xmath67 are independent on index @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the internal energy per spin is equal to the correlation function @xmath67 @xmath69 from eqs .",
    "( [ n12 ] ) and ( [ uuu ] ) , we have @xmath70 this equation indicates that for the case of even spins the entanglement between two nearest neighbors is solely determined by the internal energy per spin . and for the case of zero temperature , the entanglement is determined by the ground - state energy .",
    "the less the energy , the more the entanglement .",
    "we now apply the above result to the study of ground - state entanglement .",
    "we rewrite the four - spin hamiltonian as follows @xmath71.\\ ] ] then , by the angular momentum coupling theory , we obtain the ground - state energy per site @xmath72 .",

    "we next numerically calculate the entanglement for the case of more spins , and also consider the effects of magnetic fields .",
    "having obtained analytical results of entanglement in the heisenberg model with a few spins , we now numerically examine the entanglement behaviors in more general hamiltonian including more spins and magnetic fields .",
    "we consider the entanglement versus temperature for different number of spins @xmath66 , and the numerical results are plotted in fig .  2 and fig .",
    "it is clear to see that the ground state exhibits maximal entanglement , and with the increase of temperature , the entanglement monotonically decreases until it reaches zero .",
    "the decrease of entanglement is due to the mixture of less entangled excited states when increasing the temperature .",
    "the existence of the threshold temperature is also evident . for the case of even number of sites ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the threshold temperature decreases with the increase of @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast to this behavior , for the case of odd number of spins , as seen from fig .  3 , the threshold temperature increases with the increase of @xmath66 .",
    "we now examine the effect of magnetic fields on entanglement .",
    "the heisenberg hamiltonian with a magnetic field along @xmath75 direction is given by @xmath76 for @xmath77 , the analytical result of negativity can be obtained ( see appendix a ) .",
    ".,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .  4",
    ", we plot the negativity versus the magnetic field at a low temperature .",
    "for the two - spin case , with the increase of the magnetic field , the negativity rapidly reach a platform , and then after a certain magnetic field @xmath78 , it jumps down to zero , indicating no entanglement . when @xmath79 , the ground state is two - fold degenerate with @xmath80 . for a small @xmath81 , the system is no longer degenerate , and the ground state is given by @xmath82 which is of the schmidt form .",

    "the jump of negativity at @xmath93 is due to the level crossing . for @xmath94 ,",
    "the effects of magnetic fields on entanglement can be also explained by level crossing .",
    "for instance , for @xmath95 , there are two level crossing , and the entanglement displays two jumps .",
    "we have studied the effects of finite temperature and magnetic fields on entanglement , and now consider the model containing two kinds of spins , spin @xmath11 and @xmath12 , alternating on a ring with antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between both the nn spins and the nnn spins .",

    "@xmath97 characterizes the nn exchange coupling and @xmath98 the nnn coupling .",
    "we consider the antiferromagnetic interaction by taking @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath66 is the total number of spins and here we choose it be even .",
    "also we adopt the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the model with four spins is the simplest model with nnn interactions .",
    "we first solve the eigenvalue problem of this model .",
    "the key step is to write the four - spin hamiltonian in the following form , @xmath100\\nonumber\\\\ & -&2j_2({\\bf s}_1 ^ 2+{\\bf s}_2 ^ 2+{\\bf s}_1 ^ 2+{\\bf s}_2 ^ 2 ) \\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 denotes the total spin . from the above form , by angular momentum coupling theory , one can readily obtain all eigenvalues of the system as @xmath102 where parameter @xmath103 in expressions @xmath104 and @xmath105 and @xmath106 in expressions @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",

    "therefore , we can get the correlator @xmath112 from the ground - state energy via the hellmann - feynman theorem .    when @xmath113 , after applying the hellmann - feynman theorem to the ground - state energy , we obtain @xmath114 due to the su@xmath110 symmetry in our system , we have the following relation between the negativity and the correlator @xmath115@xcite , @xmath116 where we use @xmath117 to denote the negativity between the nn spins .",

    "the strong nnn interaction and thermal fluctuation will suppress the nn entanglement to zero .    we do not plot the negativity @xmath134 as it is zero all along for any @xmath98 and @xmath131 .",
    "we give the nnn negativity @xmath135 in fig .",

    ", there is no negativity @xmath139 at any temperature .",
    "the threshold @xmath146 is increased by the increasing temperature , similar to the four - spin case .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the entanglement properties of the ( 1/2,1 ) mixed - spin systems described by the heisenberg model . in the systems only with nn exchange interactions , for two - spin and three - spin cases analytical results of the negativity have been obtained , which facilitate our discussions of entanglement .",
    "the analytical expression of threshold temperature after which the entanglement vanishes are obtained for the two - site case . for the case of even number of particles",
    ", it has been found that the pairwise thermal entanglement is solely determined by the internal energy , and thus builds an interesting relation between the microscopic quantity , entanglement , and the macroscopic thermal dynamical function , the internal energy in the mixed - spin systems .",

    "we have numerically studied the effects of different finite temperature and magnetic fields on entanglement . as a conclusion",
    ", the thermal fluctuation suppresses the entanglement , and entanglement may change evidently at some critical points of magnetic field .    in the systems also with nnn interactions , by applying the angular momentum coupling method , we obtained analytical results of all the eigenenergies of the four - spin system , based on which the negativity of the nn spins has been obtained .",
    "we also considered the excited - state entanglement . at finite temperature , from the partition function",
    ", the analytical results of negativity has been given .",
    "we have numerically studied the effects of the nnn interaction on the nn entanglement and nnn entanglement .",
    "it is natural to see that the nnn interaction suppresses the nn entanglement , and enhances the nnn entanglement .",
    "we found that the negativity between two spin ones is sensitive to @xmath98 and displays some interesting properties . at finite temperature ,",
    "the thermal fluctuation suppresses both the nn entanglement and the nnn entanglement .",
    "the threshold values @xmath146 and @xmath149 are studied in detail .",
    "the entanglement displays some peculiar properties , which are quite different from those of the spin - half model .",
    "these are due to inherent mixed - spin character of our system .",
    "it is more interesting to study entanglements in other mixed systems and explore some universal properties , which are under consideration .",
    "the hamiltonian of the two - site heisenberg model with a magnetic field is written explicitly as @xmath167 following the same way as the discussions of subsection ii.a , the density matrix of the thermal state is given by eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) with the matrix elements @xmath168 and the partition function @xmath169 having obtained the analytical expressions of the matrix , we directly obtain the negativity after substituting the matrix elements to eq .",
