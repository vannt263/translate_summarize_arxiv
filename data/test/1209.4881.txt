    "stochastic modeling plays an important role in many areas of science , such as physics , ecology or chemistry @xcite .",
    "stochasticity may appear due to the lack of complete knowledge about all the relevant variables , the precise dynamics of the system or the interactions with the environment . in some cases",
    ", one can obtain a compact description of a complicated system considering only a few relevant variables but at the expense of losing deterministic predictability .",
    "often , probabilities for some fundamental processes can be assigned on the basis of symmetries and other considerations , or on empirical analyis , and the dynamics of the process can be derived bottom - up .",
    "stochasticity appears together with delay terms in many situations of interest , such as gene regulation @xcite , physiological processes @xcite or postural control @xcite .",
    "the combined effects of stochasticity and delay are , however , not completely understood . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", stochastic processes including delay are difficult to analyze due to the non - markovian character .",
    "most of the previous approaches have focused on stochastic differential equations , that consider continuous variables @xcite , or random walks in discrete time @xcite , where delay can be taken into account increasing the number of variables .",
    "models with discrete variables but continuous time are the natural description of many systems such as chemical reactions , population dynamics or epidemic spreading . in some cases , discreteness can be a mayor source of fluctuations , not well captured by continuous models @xcite .",
    "the approach with discrete variables and continuous time was used in @xcite . most often , the delay time is taken to be a constant with zero fluctuations .",
    "this is not very realistic in the applications , since it is unusual to have a deterministic delay when the rest of the dynamics is stochastic .",
    "we will take this consideration into account by allowing the delay times to be random variables with arbitrary probability density functions .    in this work we study some simple , yet general",
    ", stochastic birth and death processes including delay",
    ". we will develop tree different approaches to the analytical study of this kind of non - markovian processes , in the general case of stochastically distributed delay : a direct approach in subsection ( [ sec : simple ] ) , an effective markovian reduction in subsections ( [ sec : elaborated ] ) and ( [ sec : fullfeedback ] ) , and a master equation approach , together with a time - reversal invariance assumption , in section ( [ dc ] ) . the first direct approach method is interesting for its simplicity , but its application is limited to systems with first order reactions and without feedback .",
    "the second one , effective markovian reduction , is rather flexible and general and its development is one of the main advances of this paper .",
    "the last master equation approach complements the previous , giving information about the full probability distribution .",
    "the main limitation of all the approaches is the need to assume that completion times for delayed reactions are independent random variables ( independent of each other and of other variables of the system ) , although the initiation rates may depend on the state of the system , allowing , for example , for feedback and crowding effects , so we do not consider this limitation to be very relevant for practical applications .",
    "although our methodology is rather general , we present it here using specific examples that have been grouped in two categories : delay in the degradation ( section [ dd ] ) and delay in the creation ( section [ dc ] ) .",
    "we end the paper with a brief discussion and comments in section [ comments ] .",
    "some more technical details are left for the two appendices .",
    "we will start by studying simple stochastic birth and death processes that include delay in the degradation step .",
    "a process of this type was proposed in @xcite as a model for protein level dynamics with a complex degradation pathway .",
    "we consider first the simplest possible process including delayed degradation : @xmath0 that is , a particle @xmath1 is created at a rate @xmath2 and disappears (  dies \" or  degrades \" ) a time @xmath3 after created .",
    "we allow the delay time @xmath3 to be randomly distributed i.e. the lifetimes @xmath3 of the created particles are random variables , that for simplicity we consider independent and identically distributed , with probability density @xmath4 . although not considered in this paper , the case of non - identically distributed delay times , in particular a probability density that depends on the time from birth , can also be treated .",
    "however , as commented above , the case of non - independent delay times does not seem to be tractable with the methods we present below .",
    "we note first that distributed delay is completely equivalent to degradation at a rate that depends on the  age \" @xmath5 ( time form creation ) of the particle , i.e. , processes @xmath6 are equivalent if the rate @xmath7 and the probability density of the delay @xmath4 are related by : @xmath8 with @xmath9 being @xmath10 the cumulative distribution of the delay - time .",
    "this is so because @xmath11 is the probability of dying at the time interval @xmath12 , if the particle is still present at @xmath5 , and so it is nothing but the probability @xmath13 that the delay time @xmath3 belongs to that same interval conditioned to the particle still being alive at time @xmath5 , an event with probability @xmath14 . in the notation of @xcite ,",
    "@xmath7 is nothing but the _ conditional failure rate_. we take @xmath15 as the time origin , so the number of alive particles at time @xmath16 is @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 the probability of @xmath20 particles being alive at time @xmath16 . in the remaining of this subsection",
    "we assume that there is no feedback , in the sense that the creation rate @xmath2 is independent on the number of particles @xmath20 , but , for the sake of generality , we do allow it to be a function of time @xmath21 .",
    "the non - feedback assumption allows us to obtain a full analytical solution .",
    "as shown in the appendix , independently of the form of the delay distribution , @xmath19 follows a poisson distribution @xmath22 with average @xmath23 .",
    "if the creation rate , @xmath21 , is independent of time , a steady state is reached , in which the average number of particles is @xmath24 , again independently of the form of the delay distribution .",
    "we will now compute the time correlation function .",
    "we shall see that its analytical expression does depend on the form of the delay distribution .",
    "we start from the relation : @xmath25 with @xmath26 particles created after ( before ) @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath27 can be computed exactly as before ( now taking @xmath16 as the time origin ) , so we have : @xmath28 the evolution of the number of particles already present at @xmath16 depends on the age @xmath5 of these particles .",
    "their survival probability until time @xmath29 can be written as : @xmath30 where we used @xmath31 , so we find : @xmath32 from this , one easily obtains the correlation function : @xmath33(t ,",
    "t)=\\langle n(t)\\langle n(t+t)|n(t ) \\rangle\\rangle-\\langle n(t)\\rangle\\langle n(t+t)\\rangle$ ] @xmath34(t , t)=\\int_0^tdt'c(t')\\hat{f}(t+t - t')\\label{corrsimple},\\ ] ] if @xmath35 , independent of time , a steady - state can be reached with correlation function @xmath36(t)=\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}k[n](t , t)$ ] . for a constant rate @xmath37 , which would be equivalent to an exponential delay distribution @xmath38 , it has the usual exponential decay @xmath36(t)=(c/\\gamma ) e^{-\\gamma t}$ ] . for a fixed delay time",

    "the correlation function adopts different forms , but it is always monotonically decreasing . in figure ( [ correlationsimple ] )",
    "we plot the correlation function for two different types of distribution of delay , for different values of the variance of the delay .",
    "we see that the distribution with fatter tail displays a slower asymptotic decay , and that the decay is slower as the variance of the delay increases .",
    "numerical simulations , performed with a conveniently modified version of the gillespie algorithm @xcite , are in perfect agreement with this exact result , providing a check of its correctness .",
    "we remark that the functional form of the decay of the correlation function depends on the delay distributed and can differ from the exponential decay found in systems without delay .    ) , as a function of time , plotted in logarithmic scale , for two different types of delay distribution , gamma and lognormal , for two values of the variance of the delay : @xmath43 ( left panel ) and @xmath44 ( right panel ) ; in both cases the average delay is @xmath45 and the creation rate is @xmath46 . we also plot a exponential decay with exponent one ( dot - dashed line ) , for comparison .",
    "note that delay distributions with larger variance and fatter tayls display slower asymptotic decay .",
    "( online version in colour . ) [ correlationsimple ] ]      we now consider a process including both instantaneous and delayed degradation steps : @xmath47 this is , particles are created at a rate @xmath2 and each particle can be eliminated by two processes : i ) instantaneous degradation at a rate @xmath37 ; ii ) delayed degradation , initiated at a rate @xmath48 but completed only a time @xmath3 after initiation .",
    "again , we will allow the delay - degradations times to be random variables that , for simplicity , will be independent and identically distributed with probability density function @xmath4 .    for the process to be completely defined",
    ", one has to specify if a particle that initiates delayed - degradation at time @xmath16 and thus will disappear at @xmath49 ( this kind of particles will be called  infected \" ) , can also disappear before the completion of this reaction , through instantaneous degradation . in the most general case",
    ", this can happen at a rate @xmath50 , not necessarily equal to @xmath37 .",
    "note that , in the case of first - order degradation ( @xmath50 not dependent on the number of particles @xmath20 ) , this instantaneous degradation is completely equivalent to a system with @xmath51 , after modifying the distribution of the delayed - degradation times in the following way : @xmath52 that is , when instantaneous degradation is added to infected particles , the probability that the lifetime is equal to @xmath3 has two contributions : ( i ) a particle initially has a lifetime @xmath3 ( probability density @xmath4 ) and survives up to this time ( an event with probability @xmath53 ) ; ( ii ) a particle has a lifetime larger than @xmath3 ( probability @xmath54 ) , but survives up to @xmath3 ( probability @xmath53 ) and then undergoes instantaneous degradation ( at rate @xmath50 ) .",
    "the consideration of these two contributions leads straightforwardly to eq.([ftau2 ] ) .",
    "we see that omitting first order instantaneous degradation of infected particles comprises no loss of generality , given that the treatment is valid for general distributions of delay .",
    "if @xmath48 and @xmath37 are independent of @xmath20 , the process is equivalent to the one - variable system discussed in the previous subsection [ sec : simple ] ) with a conveniently modified distribution of delay : @xmath55 this comes from the fact that a particle may disapear at time @xmath3 because it did not disapeared or was infected before and is degraded instantaneously ( probability density @xmath56 ) or because it got infected at some previous time ( @xmath57 ) with an appropriate lifetime ( @xmath58 , probability density @xmath59 ) .",
    "this includes as particular cases the ones studied in @xcite .",
    "the results of subsection ( [ sec : simple ] ) allows us to obtain the full solution also in the general case of distributed delay .",
    "if @xmath48 or @xmath37 depend on @xmath20 the processes are not anymore equivalent , two variables are necessary and a new approach is needed for the analysis . in the following we develop this method .",
    "we will also consider the case in which the creation rate @xmath2 depends on the number of particles .",
    "the full process corresponds to the following two - variable system : @xmath60 where we have split the proteins into two types : @xmath61 are infected particles that will die precisely at a time @xmath3 ( itself a stochastic variable ) after being infected and @xmath62 are non - infected (  active \" ) particles ( so @xmath63 ) .",
    "we allow the rates to depend on @xmath64 , the number of @xmath65 , active , particles , but not on @xmath66 , the number of @xmath67 , infected , particles which are considered to be  inert \" ; this condition will be realxed in the next subsetion .",
    "following @xcite , we have introduced the auxiliary particles @xmath68 whose number is given by the stochastic variable @xmath69 .",
    "the introduction of @xmath68 will allow us to obtain the properties of @xmath66 by using the relation : @xmath70 where the discrete process @xmath69 is a sequence of step ( heaviside ) functions and its derivative must be understood as a series of dirac - delta functions .",
    "here we have introduced the family of  survival \" stochastic processes @xmath71 defined in the following way : first , for each @xmath57 we obtain a value of @xmath72 independently drawn from the distribution @xmath4 .",
    "next , we set @xmath73 , if @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , otherwise .",
    "this can be considered as the indicator function of a virtual is defined for all @xmath57 , regardless if a particle is actually infected a time @xmath57 .",
    "however it only contributes to ( [ nonmarkov ] ) if a particle is actually infected at time @xmath57 , since only then @xmath76 particle that is infected at @xmath57 and survives up to a time @xmath77 .",
    "it follows from the definition that : @xmath78    expressions ( [ nonmarkov]-[corrsurvival ] ) are the main advances of this section and provide us with the necessary tools to derive the main properties of the stochastic process ( [ cx0 ] ) . in the case considered in @xcite there is a fixed delay ( @xmath40 ) and no instantaneous degradation of infected particles ( @xmath51 ) , so one has simply @xmath79 .",
    "the inclusion of the survival process @xmath71 allows us to consider the general case of distributed delay and rates depending on the state of the system .",
    "note that the process followed by @xmath80 is markovian as the delay only appears in variable @xmath67 , so the properties of @xmath81 can be obtained using markovian methods , and the properties of the variable @xmath66 can be derived afterwards using ( [ nonmarkov]-[corrsurvival ] ) .",
    "in particular , the first moments follow : @xmath82 using standard markovian methods @xcite , one can prove that the process @xmath80 is described by the master equation : @xmath83 with @xmath84 the step operator , @xmath85 . in this section , we allow the creation rate @xmath2 to depend on the number of @xmath65-particles , constituting a feedback term on the number of `` active '' particles . from the master equation one",
    "easily derives the equations for the moments , the first of them read : @xmath86 in the case that @xmath87 is a linear function of @xmath64 and @xmath37 and @xmath48 do not depend on @xmath64 ( and none of them depend on @xmath66 or @xmath81 ) , the system of equations is closed and can be solved . for non - linear systems , we will make use of van kampen s expansion @xcite .",
    "this is a standard systematic expansion of the master equation , that consists on assuming a deterministic , and a stochastic part for the variables that scale differently with a large parameter , @xmath88 ( typically the volume or system size ) i.e. @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "one can then write the master equation for the new variables @xmath91 , @xmath92 and expand in powers of @xmath93 .",
    "the method is generically valid , provided that the rates depend on the variables only trough @xmath94 ( plus higher orders in @xmath95 ; a common factor depending on @xmath88 multiplying all rates is also acceptable ) , which is fulfilled by most systems of interest , and that the macroscopic equations have a steady state as a single attractor .",

    "usually , for the ansatz about the scaling of the variables to work ( and so the expansion ) , the equations for the macroscopic components must have a single stable fixed point . in this case , however , the equation for @xmath100 does not have a fixed point , and @xmath101 and @xmath102 grow without bound .",

    "we allow two delays , one in the creation ( with probability density @xmath177 ) , and one in the degradation ( with probability density @xmath178 ) .",

    "in this paper we have analyzed general stochastic birth and death models that include delay .",
    "we have presented three different methods that together constitute a general toolbox to study stochastic models including delay .    in sub - section ( [ sec : simple ] ) we have shown that when the creation rate is independent of the state of the system ( no feedback ) and the initiation of the delayed degradation and the instantaneous degradation are first order reactions ( rate not depending on the state of the system ) , the process can be solved fully in an exact fashion for general distributions of delay , showing always poissonian character and a monotonically decreasing time correlation function given by ( [ corrsimple ] ) .    in sub - sections ( [ sec : elaborated ] ) , ( [ sec : fullfeedback ] ) we have considered a more general process with delay in the degradation step , allowing the initiation of the delay degradation and the instantaneous degradation to be higher order reactions , as well as the presence of feedback in the creation rate .",
    "the method allows to reduce the system to a markovian one , where usual techniques can be used .",
    "explicit expressions for the time correlation for general delay distributions were obtained . in this case",
    "the correlation might be non - monotonic , if feedback is present , but typically decreases monotonically .",
    "section ( [ dc ] ) shows that when the delay appears in the creation reaction and feedback is present , the delay typically has more dramatic consequences . in the case of fixed delay",
    ", it is shown that for negative feedback , the fluctuations are amplified as the delay increases , going beyond the level found when no feedback is present , and the time correlation function becomes oscillatory , alternating positive and negative values at approximately multiples of the delay . in the positive feedback case , again for fixed delay , the fluctuations are reduced with increased delay and the time correlation function remains always positive .",
    "we start by considering the case @xmath199 . for the sake of simplicity , we focus on the case with creation rate , @xmath2 , independent of time , but the generalization to time - dependent @xmath2 is straightforward . since the time origin is taken at @xmath15 , the probability of observing zero particles at time @xmath200 is equal to the following limit : @xmath201,\\label{p0tini}\\ ] ] with @xmath202 playing the role of a small time - increment and @xmath203 .",

    "the @xmath213-th particle is created with probability @xmath214 and survives up to @xmath16 with probability @xmath215 .",
    "the other factor comes from the fact that at the other time intervals either a particle is not created or it is created but dies before @xmath16 .    using @xmath216=e^{-c\\int_0^tdt'f(t - t')}\\ ] ] and replacing the sums by integrals in the limit @xmath217 @xmath218^n\\ ] ]",

    "as commented above , this result can be easily generalized to the case in which the creation rate depends on time , @xmath223 , obtaining again a poisson distribution with average @xmath224 .",
    "here we derive the master equation of the process ( [ eq : processcreation ] ) .",
    "we consider first the case of fixed delay @xmath3 .",
