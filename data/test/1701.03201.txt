    "dynamic coupling of ferromagnets has been of interest in the field of magnetism .",
    "the dipole interaction has been the basic interaction to excite the coupled motion of the magnetizations , and is applied to magnetic recording @xcite . another method to realize the coupling is to use the spin - transfer effect @xcite , where the application of an electric current to ferromagnetic / nonmagnetic multilayers results in the magnetization switching and self - oscillation @xcite .",
    "the coupled dynamics through pure spin current generated in spin pumping @xcite and nonlocal @xcite geometries have also been observed .",
    "it should be emphasized that these couplings are strongly restricted by the characteristic length scales .",
    "for example , the dipole coupling decays according to the inverse cube detection law , whereas the spin transfer effect by a spin - polarized electric or pure spin current occurs in a system smaller than the spin diffusion length .",
    "recently , physical phenomena , such as the spin torque @xcite and magnetoresistance effects @xcite , due to the spin hall effect @xcite in bilayers consisting of an insulating or metallic ferromagnet and a nonmagnetic heavy metal have attracted much attention .",
    "the latter , known as the spin hall magnetoresistance , originates from the charge - spin conversion of an external electric current by the direct and inverse spin hall effects , and has been observed by measuring the longitudinal and transverse electric currents , which are given by @xmath0 @xmath1 respectively , where @xmath2 is the electric current density generated by the external electric field .",
    "the definitions of the dimensionless coefficients , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , are given below .",
    "it should be emphasized that the currents given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : longitudinal_current ] ) and ( [ eq : transverse_current ] ) depend on the magnetization direction @xmath6 .",
    "when another ferromagnet is placed onto the same nonmagnet , these currents will be converted to spin current by the spin hall effect again , and excite spin torque on this additional ferromagnet .",
    "then , the magnetization dynamics of two ferromagnets will be coupled through the angular dependencies of the electric current given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : longitudinal_current ] ) and ( [ eq : transverse_current ] ) .",
    "this coupling is unavoidable whenever several ferromagnets are placed onto the same nonmagnet , and is not restricted by the distance between the ferromagnets because it is carried by the electric current . since the structure consisting of several ferromagnets on the nonmagnetic heavy metal will be important from the viewpoints of both fundamental physics and practical applications based on the spin hall effect , such as magnetic random access memory , spin torque oscillators , and bio - inspired computing @xcite , it is of interest to clarify the role of this coupling .    in this paper , we investigate the coupled dynamics of magnetizations in ferromagnets in the presence of the spin hall effect by solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation numerically for both longitudinal and transverse geometries .",
    "in addition to the external electric current , the current contributing to the spin hall magnetoresistance also excites the spin torque .",
    "the strength of this additional torque is estimated from the theory of the spin hall magnetoresistance extended to the system consisting of several ferromagnets .",
    "the conventional spin torque is proportional to the spin hall angle @xmath7 , whereas the new torque is on the order of @xmath8 , and therefore , its value is two orders of magnitude smaller than the conventional spin torque .",
    "nevertheless , it is found that this additional new torque affects the phase difference of the magnetization in the self - oscillation state .",
    "the numerical simulation reveals that the in - phase or antiphase synchronization is observed in the transverse geometry . on the other hand , in addition to them , the phase difference becomes a quarter of a period in the longitudinal geometry .",
    "it is found that these phase differences depend on the values of the gilbert damping constant and the dimensionless field - like torque strength . an analytical theory clarifying the relation among the current , frequency , and phase difference",
