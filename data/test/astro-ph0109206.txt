    "classical nova outbursts take place in mass transferring binaries , when hydrogen - rich material is accreted onto a white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "once enough matter has accumulated , nuclear burning sets in explosively causing a complex and dynamical initial phase of the nova outburst . around visual maximum however , a much more steady phase begins , where an extremely large ratio of luminosity to mass occurs and the structure of the star resembles that of a giant : a nuclear burning shell sitting on top of the wd , covered by an extended envelope of very little mass ( typically @xmath0 ) .    schenker ( 1999 ) analyses the pulsational stability of such a structure assuming a static envelope , or ( given the ongoing evolution of the nova on time - scales of maybe weeks or months ) a sequence of quasi - static envelopes .",
    "the background models for the linear analysis have been constructed by a linear series of core plus envelope models , obtained via a shooting method .",
    "figure 1a ( left panel ) shows their position in the hr diagram . along these curves a radial , non - adiabatic linear stability analysis has been performed utilising the riccati method ( gautschy & glatzel 1990 ) . for the 20 models",
    "specifically marked i have also studied the non - linear evolution with adaptive - grid radiation hydro - code ( rhd , dorfi & feuchtinger 1991 ) .    one major result is plotted in figure 1b ( right panel ) , showing the complex eigenspectrum of model b ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "frequencies @xmath2 are plotted normalised with the free - fall time - scale in full non - adiabatic treatment and two different approximations .",
    "most striking are the enormous growth rates found , of the same order as the free - fall time - scale .",
    "this is the case not only in model b , but for an extended range of @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to classical pulsators on the instability strip ( e.g.  rr lyr stars ) here the adiabatic approximation can not reproduce the frequencies at all . however , a highly suitable approximation for such a situation is the non - adiabatic reversible approximation ( nar ) , also used by glatzel ( 1994 ) and saio , baker , & gautschy ( 1998 ) in their investigations into the nature of strange modes .",
    "one typical characteristic is the occurrence of complex conjugate pairs of eigenfrequencies as apparent in figure 1b .",
    "nar represents the eigenmodes almost perfectly around the centre of the instability region ( model b ) , not only in frequency ( fig .",
    "1b ) but also in terms of the eigenfunctions .",
    "these eigenfunctions ( cf .  fig .",
    "2 ) represent complex standing , but in their projection running waves ( in @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) : outwards for the unstable , and inwards for the stable mode of each pair . in figure 2 , fully non - adiabatic eigenfunctions are shown by amplitude and phase , so perfectly complex conjugate pairs of waves running inwards & outwards would have identical arguments but negative phase in each of the eigenfunctions .",
    "this is almost fulfilled and a mathematical requirement for nar solutions , with the exception of the luminosity perturbation @xmath5 which is effectively set to zero in this approximation .",
    "an improved local analysis with gradients on such models reveals their nature as radiation - modified acoustic modes .",
    "it also allows to understand the spectrum found ( e.g.  in fig .  1 ) to some degree .",
    "the complementary analysis using the rhd code provides further characteristics of the modes and consequences in the non - linear regime . during the linear growth , and more so lateron ,",
    "an additional energy transport is observed , as packets of radiation energy are spiralling outwards in density perturbations ( similar to a `` screw conveyor '' ) .",
    "this is likely to be responsible for the new `` equilibrium '' structure of background model , which actually forms a curve on the hr diagram which can significantly deviate from the initial position .    as a possibly related phenomena with non - radial behaviour of envelopes under strong radiation fields , shaviv ( 2001 )",
    "has studied the application of super - eddington winds on novae . in his model spatial variations of opacity allow a larger radiation flux to pass , whereas in the 1-dimensional case here only temporal modulations provide a similar effect .    although the project initially attempted to explain oscillation during the so - called `` transition phase '' ( bianchini , friedjung , & brinkmann 1992 ) , a more probably scenario for direct observational evidence lies in the predicted x - ray oscillations shortly before the turn - off of many novae ( including the faster ones on more massive wds , cf .",
    "it has become evident that static equilibrium models of novae after visual maximum are subject to violent pulsational instabilities .",
    "this finding ( i ) may suggests a possible link between mass loss in novae and pulsations , but ( ii ) at least excludes a purely quasi - static evolution even for the lowest mass novae ( possibly systems like v723 cas and hr del ) , where common mass loss mechanisms tend to fail . for more massive wds",
    ", only the very late phases of the outburst could be modelled .",
    "while they do also show instabilities , they still might pulsate even during the non - static earlier part .",
    "classical novae form an excellent laboratory for pulsations under radiation dominated conditions , so both fields will benefit from their further detailed study .",
