    "dynamical friction is the reaction force that a perturber feels from the gravitational wake it generates in the ambient medium .",
    "this fundamental interaction has therefore had a wide range of applications in the formation of astronomical structures .",
    "applications to collisionless systems include mass segregation in star clusters ( e.g. kim and morris 2003 , portegies et al 2004 ) , galaxy distribution in hierarchical cluster formation ( e.g. frenk et al 1996 , bullock and johnston 2005 ) , the decay of satellites in galactic halos and galaxy mergers ( binney and tremaine 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "dynamical friction also occurs in collisional particle systems and was applied to the study of the growth of planetesimals ( hornung et al 1985 , stewart and whetherill 1988 ) , the eccentricity excitation of planetary embryo orbits ( ida 1990 , kokubo and ida 1996 , namouni et al 1996 ) , and the confinement of planetary rings ( goldreich and tremaine 1982 ) . for gaseous systems , applications include the orbital decay of compact stars orbiting supermassive black holes ( narayan 2000 ) , and the heating of intercluster gas by decelerating supersonic galaxies ( el - zant et al .",
    "2004 , faltenbacher et al 2005 , kim et al 2005 ) .    following the pioneering work of chandrasekhar ( 1943 ) on the gravitational drag experienced by a perturber in collisionless star systems , the derivations of dynamical friction",
    "assume that the perturber has a constant velocity in the ambient medium .",
    "the assumption of uniform motion is made for collisionless systems ( binney and tremaine 2008 ) , collisional particle systems ( hornung et al 1985 , stewart and whetherill 1988 , ida 1990 , goldreich and tremaine 1982 ) as well as gaseous media ( kim and kim 2007 , kim et al 2008 , ostriker 1999 ) . the resulting dynamical friction force which depends on the perturber s velocity",
    "is subsequently used to model the evolution of the perturber s motion whose velocity varies with time .",
    "only the numerical simulations of the nonlinear fluid equations are free from this assumption ( snchez - salcedo and brandenburg 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "the neglect of the perturber s acceleration in dynamical friction is justified by the small amplitude of the force that is proportional to the square of the pertuber s mass .",
    "neglecting acceleration is independent of the type of motion and is mainly motivated by the lack of an analytical framework where the perturber s accelerated motion could be taken into account . to overcome this obstacle",
    ", we derive in appendix a a new expression of dynamical friction that applies to a general type of motion and depends on the perturber s motion and the boundary conditions but not the density perturbation .",
    "in particular , dynamical friction is shown to be non - local as it depends on the whole trajectory of the perturber . although non - locality does not appear if the perturber s velocity is constant , its origin is easy to identify : as the perturber s wake propagates in the medium , a velocity change because of acceleration affects the density enhancement near the perturber and offsets the force from its local value as the far parts of the wake were generated by a different velocity . therefore when acceleration is taken into account , the amplitude of dynamical friction may change with respect to the value derived assuming a constant velocity because in modelling the force on an accelerated perturber as that on a constant velocity perturber",
    ", one assumes that the gravitational wake produced by accelerated motion is similar to that of uniform motion .",
    "we shall see that this difference between the two wakes makes dynamical friction dependent on the initial velocity of the perturber .",
    "another difference between the wakes generated by constant velocity motion and accelerated motion is the absence of a perturbed region with front - back symmetry with respect to a subsonic accelerating perturber . in effect",
    "a constant velocity perturber raises a gravitational wake in the ambient medium that is symmetric with respect to it and truncated by the sonic shockwave .",
    "this truncation defines two regions , one that lacks front - back symmetry located behind the perturber , and one with front - back symmetry around the perturber that becomes the largest region inside the wavefront for velocities smaller than half the sound speed .",
    "dynamical friction arises from the former region as shown by ostriker ( 1999 ) .",
    "when acceleration is taken into account , front - back symmetry is lost everywhere .",
    "this would intuitively imply that dynamical friction on an accelerated perturber should be much larger than the value derived assuming uniform motion for subsonic perturbers .",
    "curiously , we shall show that the force on an accelerating subsonic perturber initially at rest is similar to the uniform friction force .",
    "lastly , accelerated motion friction would differ from uniform motion friction because the former never reaches steady state . in effect , dynamical friction on a constant subsonic velocity perturber is known to be time - independent ( ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "it is the object of this paper to quantify how taking into account acceleration modifies dynamical friction on a perturber travelling in an infinite homogeneous gaseous medium .",
    "the perturber s motion is assumed to have a constant acceleration , a choice that makes the analytical developments simpler .",
    "physically such constant acceleration approximates the deceleration felt by the perturber because of dynamical friction as the force amplitude is small and the corresponding instantaneous velocity change is equally small .",
    "constant acceleration also models the motion of a young star with an asymmetric jet system moving in interstellar gas ( hirth et al 1994 , hartigan and morse 2007 , namouni 2005 , 2007 ) . in what follows",
    ", we characterize the density perturbation associated with accelerated motion in section 2 .",
    "we derive the force on an accelerated perturber in section 3 using the general expression of dynamical friction ( derived in appendix a ) that does not depend on the density enhancement caused by the perturber but only on the perturber s motion and the medium s boundary conditions . in particular we show that including acceleration makes dynamical friction dependent on the initial velocity of the perturber .",
    "section 4 contains concluding remarks . in appendix",
    "b , the new expression of dynamical friction derived in appendix a is validated by applying it to uniform rectilinear motion and recovering the known results on dynamical friction .",

    "the roots of the argument of the @xmath24function in equation ( [ density2 ] ) satisfy the quartic equation : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the spherical radius .",
    "this equation is the counterpart of the quadratic equation derived by ostriker ( 1999 ) for uniform motion .",
    "the former may be reduced to the latter once time and length dimensions are restored .",
    "equation ( [ roots ] ) , however , can not be solved analytically because its varying coefficients do not permit simple and unique expressions of the roots .",

    "the perturber reaches mach 1 at @xmath35 but remains inside the sonic wavefront of radius @xmath36 as the latter has been propagating faster than the perturber s velocity .",
    "once the velocity is supersonic , a mach cone is formed inside the sonic wavefront and a shallow density depression develops and trails the perturber ( @xmath37 ) .",

    "the density enhancement of subsonic perturbers has a structure similar to that of uniform motion ( ostriker 1999 ) but lacks its front - back symmetry with respect to the perturber .",
    "we show in the following section that under certain circumstances , dynamical friction may be not significantly affected by the loss of front - back symmetry even as closed level curves around the perturber contribute to the force unlike those of uniform motion ( see introduction ) .",
