    "this geometrically thick structure would explain the relative strength of the ir emission as well as the angle - dependent obscuration of the accretion disk and broad line region , leading to the well - established type 1/type 2 dichotomy of unobscured and obscured objects .",

    "detailed studies of the type 1 agn ngc3783 and the type 2 sources ngc 1068 and the circinus galaxy imply that the ir emission emerges from at least two distinct parsec - scale structures : ( 1 ) a compact , geometrically thin disk in the equatorial region of the agn , and ( 2 ) an extended , elongated polar structure , which is cospatial with the outflow region of the agn on larger scales @xcite . the disk seems to be contributing a relatively larger fraction to shorter wavelengths , while the polar region dominates the overall ir emission energetically , which requires a significant covering fraction .",
    "individual aspects of this behaviour may be explained with radiative transfer effects within a torus ; however , the combination of extension , direction and emitted radiation strongly disfavours current torus models , either smooth or clumpy .",
    "one of the hypotheses put forward to explain this structure leans on the idea that matter accreting onto the agn is subject to radiative and hydrodynamic pressure producing strong outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in the specific picture outlined in @xcite ,",
    "the disk component represents the inflowing dusty gas . near the sublimation radius ,",
    "the radiation pressure from both the agn and the dust itself causes material to lift up and form a hollow outflow cone .",
    "both outflow and disk contribute to the obscuration .",
    "this paper presents the radiative transfer model _ cat3d - wind _ of a clumpy disk and outflow with the geometry and dust composition built upon the hypothesis outlined in @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that such a configuration reproduces key observational characteristics of agn , including the overall ir seds , the type 1/type 2 dichotomy , the observed disk plus polar emission structure , and the @xmath1 bump seen in many unobscured agn .",
    "the _ cat3d - wind _ model is based on the parametrisation of a clumpy dust torus used in the underlying _",

    "classical torus models do not account for the observed predominance of polar emission in the mid - ir emission of agn .",

    "finally , a wind - to - disk ratio @xmath17 defines the ratio between number of clouds along the cone and @xmath10 .",

    "<S> while current models assume that the ir is emitted from a dusty torus in the equatorial plane of the agn , spatially resolved observations indicate that the majority of the ir emission from @xmath0100pc in many agn originates from the polar region , contradicting classical torus models . </S>",
    "<S> the new model _ cat3d - wind _ builds upon the suggestion that the dusty gas around the agn consists of an inflowing disk and an outflowing wind . here </S>",
    "<S> , it is demonstrated that ( 1 ) such disk+wind models cover overall a similar parameter range of observed spectral features in the ir as classical clumpy torus models , e.g. the silicate feature strengths and mid - ir spectral slopes , ( 2 ) they reproduce the @xmath1 bump observed in many type 1 agn unlike torus models , and ( 3 ) they are able to explain polar emission features seen in ir interferometry , even for type 1 agn at relatively low inclination , as demonstrated for ngc3783 . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristics make it possible to reconcile radiative transfer models with observations and provide further evidence of a two - component parsec - scaled dusty medium around agn : the disk gives rise to the @xmath1 near - ir component , while the wind produces the mid - ir emission . </S>",
    "<S> the model seds will be made available for download . </S>"
