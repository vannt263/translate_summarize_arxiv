    "social media platforms are some of the most popular information sharing mediums in use today .",
    "they provide a wealth of real - time information , which , if used effectively can provide insights about what is happening in the world .",
    "importantly , during emergency situations such as natural disasters , the information shared on social media has been shown to be valuable to enhance the emergency response  @xcite .",
    "in particular , experts in a variety of domains have developed tools to use social media to identify and track events  @xcite .",
    "for example , the crisis tracker system  @xcite makes use of a manually created set of search terms to crawl crisis - related content , which is then clustered automatically and manually annotated by volunteers . in general , social media tracking and analysis tools can collect , enrich , aggregate and visualize information from people involved in an event , enabling both the general public and emergency response agencies to better monitor what is happening in real - time .    however , many current crisis tracking and analysis tools rely on real - time volunteer ( `` the crowd '' ) effort to enable or enhance core functions , such as information categorization  @xcite , location identification  @xcite or information verification  @xcite .",
    "this reliance on humans for core functionalities can be disadvantageous , particularly during the outset of a disaster , where volunteers may not yet be in place .",
    "furthermore , current fully automatic platforms such as twitris  @xcite and twitcident  @xcite are tied to one social media platform , and hence are not applicable to deployment in regions where those platforms are less prevalent .",
    "on the other hand , a wider array of automatic solutions for real - time event detection in social streams  @xcite , sentiment analysis  @xcite , timeline summarization  @xcite and credibility estimation of social content are becoming available , which present new opportunities to provide enhanced automatic tools for disaster monitoring on social media .",
    "hence , we present a new crisis tracking and analysis toolkit , named : eaims ( emergency analysis identification and management system ) , which aims to provide automatic identification , tracking , summarization and exploration tools over social content generated during emergency events .",
    "eaims differs from most existing crisis analysis toolkits , in that it provides a richer suite of automatic tracking and analysis tools , namely : automatic event detection , timeline construction , targeted sentiment analysis , user - community identification and information credibility estimation , as well as information access support tools in the form of social media search and discussion threads ranking and visualization .",
    "eaims is social media platform - independent , making it applicable to deployment in regions that use alternative platforms .",
    "to illustrate the functionalities of the eaims toolkit , we describe how eaims might be used during a real event .",
    "more precisely , we use the large earthquake that occurred during 24th of august 2016 in central italy as our example when using twitter as a social media data source , as illustrated in figures  [ fig : stratv ] and [ fig : tactv ] .",
    "eaims supports two operational levels , namely strategic and tactical , based on requirements defined by civil protection and law enforcement agencies  @xcite .",
    "the strategic level supports the early identification of an event for the end - user using social media as a sensor for what is happening in the world .",
    "in particular , users are able to define tracking profiles targeted for particular types of events ( earthquakes in our example ) .",
    "once a profile is registered , social media content is collected and first story detection ( fsd ) technologies  @xcite are used to identify posts representing candidate events , which are then pushed in real - time to a map screen as pings ( figure  [ fig : stratv ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the user can view the content of these posts within the strategic ui ( figure  [ fig : stratv ] ( b ) ) .",
    "multiple tracking policies can be used concurrently by different users , which enables the identification multiple events of different types .",
    "once an event has occurred , the user can transition from the strategic to the tactical level .",
    "the tactical level provides a targeted data collection for a particular event , as well as a suite of data enrichment , data exploration and visualization tools for use of the collected content .",
    "in particular , once the user is confident that an emergency event is in progress , they can use the _ event builder _ function of eaims to configure the tracking of that event , e.g. by setting event - specific tracking terms to collect data for ( figure  [ fig : stratv ] ( c ) ) .",
    "once the event tracking is configured , the user opens the tactical level ui for that event .",
    "the tactical level ui visualizes the output of a series of social sensors that select or enrich ( e.g. by automatically adding sentiment or credibility labels ) the social data collected , as well as provides social media content search and discussion threads visualization . in particular , within the tactical ui , eaims provides : real - time search using the terrier information retrieval platform  @xcite with automatic credibility estimation over the ranked content ( figure  [ fig : tactv ] ( a ) ) ; sentiment tracking for particular named people , organizations or places ( figure  [ fig : tactv ] ( b ) ) ; top influencer identification within the social network(s ) ( figure  [ fig : tactv ] ( c ) ) ; visualization of the most active relevant discussion threads within the social network(s ) ( figure  [ fig : tactv ] ( d ) ) ; and automatic event timeline generation ( figure  [ fig : tactv ] ( e ) ) . the underlying eaims services that feed the tactical visualization support content collection and analysis from multiple events concurrently , as long as those events have been registered with the event builder .",
    "an earlier version of the eaims toolkit was published in @xcite , where the additional technical details of the platform can be found .",
    "the current version of the toolkit has been extended with real - time automatic extraction and storage of active discussion threads within the social media platform , as well as ranking and visualization capabilities for those discussion threads ( figure  [ fig : tactv ] ( d ) ) .",
    "in particular , based on consultation with civil protection and police agencies , it was suggested that discussion threads on social media are a desirable means to both represent discussion topics and user communities during emergencies . indeed , when considering reasoning about information veracity within social networks , discussion threads are a natural unit to analyze , as they are topically coherent .",
    "however , within some social networks , discussion threads can not be accessed directly . instead , discussion threads are exposed as annotations on each individual post .",
    "for instance , within twitter , discussion threads are represented by either ` in_reply_to_status_id ' or ` retweet.id ' annotations added to each tweet . for this reason , it is necessary to construct the discussion thread structure in real - time .",
    "eaims uses an inverted index structure to construct the various discussion threads for an event over time . in this case , the inverted index stores the posting list ( documents contained ) for each discussion thread , while the lexicon stores the identifiers for each thread .",
    "when a new post @xmath0 arrives on the stream , if that post is not a reply to a previous post , then it is considered the start of a new thread , and is hence added to the lexicon ( we use the identifier of the first post as the thread identifier ) . if the post @xmath0 is a reply , then a three - stage update operation is performed .",
    "first , the inverted index is used to get the posting list for the source post that tn replies to , denoted @xmath1 .",
    "this posting list is in effect the discussion thread that @xmath0 belongs to .",
    "second , a new ` document ' is generated that contains the identifiers from all of the posts in the @xmath1 posting list , as well as the identifier for @xmath1 , i.e. this ` document ' represents the new thread for @xmath0 .",
    "this document is indexed , which both constructs the posting list for @xmath0 , but also updates the posting lists for the ( sub-)threads within @xmath0 .",
    "conceptionally , under this approach , the inverted index maintains k copies of a discussion thread , where k is the length of that thread .",
    "each copy is keyed by a different post within the thread . in this way",
    ", the full discussion thread can be retrieved in a single operation regardless of which post in the thread is replied to . for long - running events with very large thread sizes , storing multiple copies of each thread can be avoided by having all k posts within a thread ` map ' down to a single posting list .        within eaims ,",
    "the inverted index structure can be used to find the largest discussion threads at the current moment for the user .",
    "these are visualized as a tabular overview , as shown in figure  [ fig : tactv ] ( b ) .",
    "a user can then select a particular thread to open a more detailed view of the post within that thread and their statistics , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : thread ] .",
    "eaims is a prototype tool designed to aid emergency management organizations analyze and explore social media content in real - time during emergency and/or large public events .",
    "it was developed as part of a larger ec fp7 project called super ( social sensors for security assessments and proactive emergencies management ) .",
    "the outcomes of super , including the social sensors illustrated by eaims are being deployed and evaluated by end - users from the civil protection service of the campania region ( italy ) during flash flood emergencies , as well as end - users from the general inspectorate of romanian police , for safety monitoring during large public events .",
    "this work has been carried out in the scope of the ec co - funded super project ( fp7 - 606853 ) .",
