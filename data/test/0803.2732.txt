    "the intracellular active transport of particles , including organelles , vesicles and virus is mediated by motor proteins such as myosin , kinesins and dyneins * @xcite*. the unidirectional motion of a single motor along protein filaments is well characterized experimentally and it was first modeled at a microscopic level by a stochastic dynamics describing the behavior of a brownian particle in the presence of a time - dependent asymmetric potential field @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the idea is based on the mechanism of `` ratchet and paw '' introduced by feynmann to discuss the meaning of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite . since then , this model has been used as a prototype to explain why and in what conditions brownian particles are able to do work against external potential gradients .",
    "also if particles can bind directly to motors , the transport of cargo follows as a direct consequence of motor movement .",
    "more recently , it appeared in the literature attempts to describe the movement of interacting brownian motors , since it was realized that collective effects emerging from this situation may be relevant to explain certain characteristics of cellular transport and , in particular , the observed property of bidirectionallity of cargo movement @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this non - diffusive type of process is characterized by inversions of cargo direction after processive runs that may be preceded by relative large _ resting times _ ( intervals within which the particles remain at the same microtubule site ) .",
    "attempts to describe the observed bidirectional movement of extensive objects ( filaments ) mediated by motor proteins use essentially the same ideas of the original microscopic models @xcite .",
    "numerical results indicate that some of the observed characteristics of  bidirectional movement are captured in this way provided that the number of motors attached simultaneously to the filament , arranged in a periodic way , be no less than  a certain critical number @xmath0 .",
    "because of this , it is not clear how such models could be extended to describe the observed bidirectional movement of small particles , as vesicles or virus .",
    "the most accepted explanation in these cases is referred in the literature as the _ coordination model _ @xcite . according to this , the bidirectional movement would result from the coordinated action of two type of motors - a plus - ended and a minus - ended motor - attached simultaneously to cargo ( filament ) .",
    "the reversal of its direction would just reflect the fact that one or other type of motor , but not both simultaneously , shall be active during the respective time intervals .",
    "the motor coordination , that is , the control of motors activity would be accomplished by an external non - motor protein complex that should be able to coordinate the movement and timing of many motors of different nature and distinct characteristics - certainly a very non - trivial job . such an external complex has never been identified in any _ in vivo _",
    "experiment @xcite .    at certain scales of interest ,",
    "phenomena related to the collective behavior of interacting brownian motors can also be approached  by models that are intended to describe dynamic aspects of continuum media .",
    "such description , referred in the following as _ macroscopic _ model , is generally justified upon evaluation of the characteristic sizes and time scales where the molecules operate at very low reynold s numbers @xcite .",
    "usually , the approach is based on the continuum versions of the asymmetric exclusion processes  ( asep ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite for studying the _ long - time _ behavior of motors interacting through volume excluded @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . * * from this perspective , the individual microscopic asymmetric movement of motors is assumed _ a priori _ and for _ open boundary conditions _ the problem consists in analyzing the _ steady - state _ behavior of a defined motor density as the solutions to the corresponding non - linear differential equation - the non - viscous burgers equation - that describes the dynamics of the system in these limits .",
    "it is also possible to superimpose to the asep a non - conservative langmuir process to allow the system exchange motors with the bulk at any position of the microtubule @xcite .",
    "apparently , however , questions related to cargo transport , have not been considered in this context .    here",
    ", we make a proposal in this direction based on considerations about the interactions between cargo and motor molecules .",
    "it relies on the idea that the arrival of a cargo particle may perturb the motor system in such a way to produce local changes onto the existing motor density .",
    "thereafter cargo may take advantage of the gradients induced by this initial perturbation to move along microtubule by _ surfing _ at the density shock waves formed as the motor system relaxes back to the situation before interaction with cargo .",
    "shock waves separate regions of different motor densities and evolve according to the _ transient _ solutions to the corresponding burgers equation for the considered initial conditions ( perturbation ) . within this view , bidirectional movement of cargo particles follows naturally as a consequence of the reversals of shocks propagation direction .    from a more quantitative perspective",
    ", we use data from the movement of vesicles in drosophila embryo @xcite to perform a phenomenological analysis of the model considering the explicit expressions obtained for shock velocities . as we shall see",
    ", this allows us to associate geometrical characteristics of cargo with the extension and magnitude of the perturbation it produces .",
    "we then discuss on the possibility to make a connection between these results with the properties of the observed movement of virus at the cell body .",
    "we consider the continuum limit of the mean field approximation ( the macroscopic limit ) of an asep discrete model representing the stochastic dynamics of particle motors moving in a one - dimensional space . within this view",
    ", the diffusion process is not accounted for explicitly ; its effects on the movement of each motor under the time - dependent asymmetric potential , are assumed _ a priori .",
    "_ yet , the parameters that define the asymmetry of the potential , can be incorporated into the parameters of the considered asep__. _ _    consider the time - dependent asymmetric and periodic microscopic potential shown in * fig .",
    "1*. the position of each minimum may be associated to the position of a one - dimensional lattice site ; the distance between sites being @xmath1 coincides with the spacial period of the potential .",
    "the difference between parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 define the strength of the asymmetry .",
    "the time dependence is such that it alternates between an `` off '' state ( flat potential ) , when the particle feels no forces , and an state  `` on '' - the sawtooth profile shown .",
    "if the potential is turned off and the particle starts to diffuse from a local minimum corresponding to the site @xmath4 of the lattice , it shall diffuse around this position up to the instant when the potential is turned on again , after a time interval @xmath5 . at this instant ,",
    "the particle is supposed to fall immediately into the nearest minimum ( adiabatic approximation ) . because @xmath6 and considering a regime of relative slow diffusion , it is more likely that the nearest  minimum achieved by the particle be that at site @xmath7 .",
    "this prototype mechanism was conceived to explain from a microscopic point of view the observed unidirectional movement of a brownian motor @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "asep models have been introduced more recently in this context as a way to account for collective effects of many motors moving on the same lattice model ( @xcite , @xcite ) . at these scales , motors are _ self - driven _ and the interactions among them are that of volume excluded , i.e. a motor can not occupy a site already occupied by another motor .",
    "let us now consider a stochastic description of the process at this scale .",
    "the time unit being the interval @xmath5 within which a particle can execute one movement to a neighbor site with ( transition ) probability @xmath8 to move from site @xmath4 to site @xmath7 and ( transition ) probability @xmath9 to move from site @xmath4 to site @xmath10 . neglecting correlations ( mean - field approximation ) the average density @xmath11 of motors at site @xmath4 , at time",
    "@xmath12 satisfies the following recurrence relation : @xmath13 excluded volume interaction is introduced into the model by attributing to @xmath8 and @xmath9 an explicit dependence on the occupation of the target sites:@xmath14 and@xmath15 here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are dimensionless constants such that @xmath18 .",
    "now , let  @xmath19 be the total number of lattice sites and let @xmath20 be its total length .",
    "as in ref.@xcite , the discrete model can be coarse - graining with lattice constant @xmath21  to a continuum such that for @xmath22 the density @xmath23 becomes a function @xmath24 of a continuum variable @xmath25 in this limit , @xmath26 can be expanded in powers of @xmath27 @xmath28 and the recurrence in ( [ recurrence 1 ] ) becomes @xmath29 + o(l^{2 } ) \\label{recurrence 2}%\\ ] ] where we have defined@xmath30    for @xmath31 and @xmath32 keeping @xmath33 in ( [ gama ] ) finite and neglecting terms of @xmath34 , eq . ( [ recurrence 2 ] ) converges to the non - viscous burgers equation @xmath35    now , a connection between the above description and the microscopic model can be made by setting @xmath36 so that eq .",
    "( [ burgers 1 ] ) is rewritten as@xmath37 where we have defined @xmath38  positive .",
    "this can also be expressed as @xmath39 with the particle current given by @xmath40 notice that to keep @xmath41 finite as @xmath22 , parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 must scale as @xmath42 the same behavior is expected for the langmuir rates in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite . in these conditions , and with no lost of generality , we can set @xmath43    the nonequilibrium steady - state solutions to this equation have already been explored in the references mention above to study the _ long - time _ behavior of molecular motor traffic with open boundary conditions .",
    "this allows one to make important predictions on the stationary density profiles related to the concentrations gradients of motors at the microtubule ends .",
    "in particular , the emergence of stable domain walls separating regions of different motor densities , predicted in these conditions , have indeed been observed in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "here , we consider periodic boundary and study the _ short - time _ behavior of the system described by eq .",
    "( [ burgers 2 ] ) , after being perturbed with respect to the motor density steady - state @xmath44 .",
    "the results we obtain for a particular choice of initial conditions are shown in the next section .",
    "it is known that perturbations around the steady state solutions of burgers equation ( [ burgers 2 ] ) may create shocks due to encounters of particles at different velocities ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this leads us to speculate that cargo may use these shock waves , by _ surfing _ at the wave fronts , in order to reach target sites .    to illustrate these ideas",
    ", we can generally conceive that the approach of cargo induces a perturbation on motor density such as to create at the cargo neighborhood regions where motor density becomes lower and others where density becomes higher than the steady state @xmath45 as an example , we choose @xmath46{ccc}% \\rho(x,0)=1/2 & \\text{for } & x<0\\\\ \\rho(x,0)=1/2-\\varepsilon & \\text{for } & 0<x<2a\\\\ \\rho(x,0)=1/2\\text { } & \\text{for } & 2a < x<3a\\ \\\\ \\rho(x,0)=1/2+\\varepsilon & \\text{for } & 3a < x<4a\\\\ \\rho(x,0)=1/2 & \\text{for } & x>4a \\end{array } \\label{condinic}%\\ ] ] to represent such perturbation ( see * fig(2a ) * ) .",
    "parameters @xmath2 and @xmath47 are related , respectively , to the extension and magnitude of this perturbation .",
    "we then use the method of characteristics to find the transient solutions to eq .",
    "( [ burgers 2 ] ) that reveal the time evolution of shocks for these initial conditions ( ic ) ( [ condinic ] ) , which is our main interest here .",
    "this is performed in the appendix .",
    "the results for the density profile are represented in * fig.(2 ) * at various instants of time . the behavior of each shock front , namely , distance traveled up to an eventual encounter with other shock fronts - which are identified here with the processive runs -  the time spent within each of these runs , and the corresponding expressions for average shock velocities are compiled in * table1*.    in the next section , we use these results to examine the consequences of the hypothesis made above .",
    "the model proposed here offers rather simple explanations to a few but essential phenomena related to motor - driven cargo transport .",
    "in particular , it suggests an alternative to interpret data showing that cargo executes a non - diffusive bidirectional movement before it arrives at its final destination .    in general the main difficulty to explain the bidirectional movement of cargo relies precisely on the fact that the existing models have been conceived to explain the unidirectional movement of motors .",
    "because of this , the original idea that the cargo movement shall be put into effect by its attachment to a single or a few identical motor proteins has been reviewed in the literature",
    ".    the alternative mechanism proposed here does not exclude the possibility that eventually , the presence of two types of motors may contribute to explain the reversals of particle direction .",
    "however , it does not use this as a necessary condition as does the coordination model mentioned above .",
    "within such an alternative context , cargo is driven by _",
    "shocks _ and this is independent of the nature of motors involved provided they offer an assessable density background .",
    "that is , in order to move and eventually change direction , cargo must be able to perturb this background and follow gradients of motor density right after perturbation , just like the putative  microscopic `` second class particles '' introduced in the context of many - particle asymmetric exclusion processes ( asep ) to study the nature of shocks at these scales @xcite , @xcite .",
    "although we do not offer here any direct evidence that would support these ideas we can test for their compatibility by confronting some experimental data with the results shown in table 1 for the considered initial conditions .",
    "for example , it is shown there that a cargo particle accompanying the wave front referred here as wave front 2 , or second shock , would perform a backward movement within a time interval @xmath48 * * @xmath49 that depends on the model parameters .",
    "within the subsequent time interval @xmath50 @xmath51 the particle would remain at rest up to the instant @xmath52 when it reverses the direction of movement .",
    "thereafter , the particle would proceed eventually changing the magnitude of its velocity though not direction anymore ( in this specific case ( [ condinic ] ) the reversal happens just once ) until the motor density recovers its steady state profile @xmath44 and the particle reaches its final destination at the one of the microtubule ends , as expected . therefore , at least qualitatively , the phenomenological aspects of the observed movement , as reversals of direction , processivity in both directions and resting times are accounted for by this model .    evidently , if one considers other initial conditions , for example by introducing additional parameters to characterize the perturbation , it is expected a great variety of time intervals and corresponding distances traveled in both directions , differing in processivity and velocity . therefore",
    ", a relevant aspect of this proposal is the possibility to attribute primarily to cargo the task for creating such gradients , thus inducing its own _ surfing _ movement .",
    "this is discussed below in connection to a more quantitative analysis of available data from real biological systems .",
    "consider for instance the data in the literature on the movement of lipid vesicles on drosophila embryo @xcite .",
    "we can check for their compatibility with the results in table 1 all expressed in terms of just two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath47 . to accomplish this",
    ", we observe that data analysis obtained from the transport of vesicles in the referred experiment identifies two typical runs in both directions : one that is short ( average distance @xmath53 ) and slow ( average velocity @xmath54 @xmath55 ) and another that is long ( average distance @xmath56 ) and fast ( average velocity @xmath57 ) .",
    "we shall use these data to  estimate the values of @xmath2 and @xmath58 we proceed by identifying @xmath59 taken from experimental data ,  with the average velocity of the 4@xmath60 shock front @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "it results was defined adimensional and that the velocities are expressed in units of the parameter @xmath41 that have been defined equal to one . ]",
    "we can now use this to predict the magnitude of the average shock front velocity for the @xmath65 shock @xmath66 which approaches very well the values ( absolute values ) observed for @xmath67 @xmath68    on the other hand , these results must be compatible with the predictions for the distances traveled by the corresponding shocks .",
    "this complements the analysis by estimating possible values for parameter @xmath69 accordingly , the predicted distance @xmath70 must be approximately one order of magnitude greater than @xmath71 .",
    "this is in fact accomplished by the results shown in table 1 since from there @xmath72    we shall now perform a slight different analysis of the data by redefining the constant @xmath2 such that @xmath73 where @xmath16 is a numerical factor . from this , @xmath74 and @xmath75 therefore , if we choose @xmath76 , it results @xmath77 and @xmath78 these can be compared to the results for @xmath79 and @xmath80 given above to conclude that the characteristic times and distances traveled by shock fronts 4 and 5 can be related in a very direct way with the typical values obtained in experiments for short and long runs , respectively .    more interesting , however , is the fact that this approach to the experimental data is made possible with the choice in ( [ a ] ) for @xmath81 .",
    "first , notice that @xmath82 is the average diameter of the vesicles transported in the referred experiments .",
    "thus , if the nature of interactions between cargo and motors are of short range , this implies that the magnitude and extension of the perturbation should be related to the geometrical characteristics  ( typical sizes ) of the cargo . therefore ,",
    "if the nature of interaction of different cargos with motors is the same , but cargo differ from each other in morphological aspects , these differences would be reflected in the specific way ( size , magnitude ) each of them perturb the equilibrium motor distribution and consequently , in the diversity of movements .",
    "such diversity is indeed observed in experiments using different motor / cargo systems and/or under different conditions @xcite .",
    "the above considerations seem specially attractive to explain the behavior of virus particles moving within the cellular environment observed more recently using confocal microscopy technique ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . according to the authors of these experiments , virus appear _ surfing _ along filopodia in such a way to perform a bidirectional motor - driven process in the presence of a _ single type of motor _ protein , unidirectional myosin ii . from these observations",
    "the authors then discuss on the possibility that , in these experiments , virus might have been able to create the conditions to induce their own movement .",
    "these observations support the idea that virus use ( hijack ) existing cell transport machinery to invade the cell @xcite .",
    "the model presented here suggests a mechanism to explain how this can be accomplished without external and specific mechanisms of coordination .",
    "such explanation has a focus on the morphological aspects of cargo - which , of course , is a distinguished characteristic of virus . in our view , this complements the suggestions made in ref .",
    "@xcite relative to the existence of a common mechanism that drives different virus particles to their targets in cells , in spite of their morphological differences .",
    "we propose that this common mechanism is just related to their ability to interact with the system by perturbing the existing motor profile .",
    "specific geometries , however , would be used by virus to create a variety of movements , possible necessary for their efficiency .",
    "we thus believe that these ideas may be helpful for studying the mechanisms of virus infection and also for designing drugs that must be directed to the cell body .",
    "here we obtain the properties of shock waves shown in * table1 * within the transient regime , after the motor system is perturbed by interaction with cargo .",
    "we apply the method of characteristics to find the transient solutions to the equation ( [ burgers 2 ] ) . for this , we follow the texts by habermann ( @xcite ) and that by evans ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath83 for the chosen initial conditions ( ic ) ( [ condinic ] ) . in turn",
    ", these solutions define the properties of shocks depicted in table 1 which is our main concern in this work . for each pair ( @xmath84 )",
    "there corresponds a characteristic curve for ( [ burgers 2 ] ) given by @xmath85 thus , the ic in ( [ condinic ] ) define the different characteristic families : @xmath86 these are represented in fig.(3 ) where one observes the occurrence of shocks dividing regions of different density values .",
    "there are six shocks .",
    "there are also shown in this figure the rarefaction regions that are localized between any two characteristic families that get apart from each other as the time evolves .",
    "the exact determination of the origin of each of these shocks ( time and space ) - and rarefaction regions  and the course of their time evolution allows us to describe the evolution of @xmath87    at the initial time ( @xmath88 ) there are two shocks :    * * shock 1 ( @xmath89 ) * at position @xmath90 , between the families defined by @xmath91and @xmath92 . the velocity of this shock front is determined by mass conservation conditions : @xmath93 where the current @xmath94 is defined by ( [ corrente ] ) .",
    "we then have @xmath95 that gives the shock position as a function of time . * * shock 2 ( @xmath96 ) * at @xmath97 , between the families defined by @xmath92 and @xmath98 .",
    "the velocity of this shock is given by @xmath99 from which @xmath100    still at @xmath88 , there originate two rarefaction regions    * * rarefaction 1 ( @xmath101 ) * at @xmath102 , evolving in the region between families @xmath103 and @xmath91 .",
    "the requirement of entropic solutions drive us to look for the corresponding family of characteristic curves @xmath101 defined by the density @xmath104 at each point in this region : @xmath105 which are also represented in fig .",
    "conversely , one can write the solutions to @xmath106 for density profile at each position @xmath107 in this region as * * @xmath108 * * rarefaction 2 ( @xmath109 ) * at @xmath110 , evolving in the region between families @xmath98 and @xmath111 .",
    "the characteristics in this region are given by @xmath112 thus @xmath113 * * shock 3 ( @xmath114 ) * the third shock occurs at time @xmath115 when the two families @xmath89 and @xmath96 cross .",
    "thus , @xmath116 is determined by the condition:@xmath117 , which gives@xmath118 + the velocity of the shock is given by @xmath119 meaning that the shock front is stationary at @xmath120 .",
    "* * shock 4 ( @xmath121 ) * occurs at time @xmath122 when the family @xmath123 with origin at @xmath124 reaches the second region of rarefaction and also cross the characteristics from family @xmath125 thus , @xmath122 is determined by the relation @xmath126 , which gives @xmath127 the ( continuity ) condition , in this case reads @xmath128 , that is@xmath129 then @xmath130 is given by the solutions to the above differential equation for initial condition @xmath131 such that @xmath132 the result is @xcite @xmath133 + the dependence on time of the corresponding shock velocity can now be found@xmath134 * * shock 5 ( @xmath135 ) * , occurs between the two rarefaction regions , at the time @xmath136 when the characteristic from the family @xmath137 that originates at @xmath138 encounters @xmath130 @xmath139 resulting@xmath140 + the mass conservation conditions in this case ( see [ raref2 ] and [ raref1 ] ) reads @xmath141 considering that @xmath142 this can be integrated to find @xmath143 thus @xmath144 * * shock 6 ( @xmath145 ) * , occurs at @xmath146 when shock 5 encounters the characteristics from family @xmath147 that starts at @xmath124 .",

    "the solutions discussed above refer to behavior of @xmath24 within the transient regime soon after being perturbed by cargo .",

    "<S> the collective behavior of molecular motor proteins have been investigated in the literature using models to describe the long - time dynamics of a unidimensional continuum motor distribution . here , we consider the phenomena related to the transport of particles ( vesicles , organelles , virus , etc ) in the realm of these continuum motor systems . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that cargo movement may result from its ability to perturb the existing motor distribution and to _ surf _ at the resulting shock waves separating regions of different motor densities within the transient regime .  in this case , the observed bidirectionality of cargo movement is naturally associated with reversals of shocks directions . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the quantitative results predicted by this model with available data for cargo velocity allows us to suggest that geometrical characteristics of the transported particle shall determine the extension and intensity of the perturbation it produces and thus , its dynamics . </S>",
