    "magnetoresistance ( mr ) is one of the basic tools for analysis of the electronic structure of metals .",
    "mr data contains important information about _ bulk _ electronic structure of cuprate high temperature superconductors .",
    "this was demonstrated by recent mr studies providing compelling evidence for reconstruction of the fermi surface in the pseudogap state of underdoped cuprates as a result of density wave ordering @xcite .",
    "several experimental techniques revealed the existence of two distinct energy scales in cuprates : the superconducting gap @xmath11 and the normal state pseudogap ( pg ) ( for review , see e.g. refs.@xcite ) with different behavior with respect to temperature @xcite , doping @xcite and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , there is no consensus on whether they are competing  @xcite , cooperating  @xcite , or representing two manifestations of the same phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "analysis of magnetic field effects is particularly useful for scrutinizing the superconducting origin of the gaps .",
    "non - superconducting ( e.g. , structural , antiferromagnetic , charge , spin , or @xmath12-density wave ) orders are typically insensitive to achievable fields @xcite . in this case , magnetic field may selectively suppress the superconducting gap .",
    "however , discussion of magnetic field effects in cuprates remains controversial .",
    "conflicting reports exist even on such a basic parameter as the upper critical field @xmath5 .",
    "it was reported that @xmath5 behaves in a conventional manner , i.e. , vanishes at @xmath0 and scales with @xmath0 as a function of doping @xcite .",
    "but it was also reported that @xmath5 is @xmath13-independent and persists well above @xmath0 @xcite and increases with underdoping despite reduction of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "there are many obstacles for deciphering mr data of cuprates such as : fuzzy superconducting transition due to persistence of the pg ; @xmath12-wave symmetry of @xmath11 ; ill defined quasiparticles ( qp ) and strong angular dependence of qp scattering rates @xcite ; very high anisotropy , which requires accurate control of transport current direction and sample geometry ; existence of an extended fluctuation region above @xmath0 @xcite ; possible doping inhomogeneity @xcite ; and extremely large @xmath14 t. one of the important open question is whether so large magnetic fields simply suppress superconductivity , or simultaneously induce a competing order , as may be suggested by observation of charge density @xcite and antiferromagnetic spin order @xcite in vortex cores .",
    "typically mr involves only qps at the fermi level , averaged over the brillouin zone , and thus does not provide spectroscopic information about the qp density of states ( dos ) away from the fermi surface .",
    "a rare exception is the @xmath15-axis transport in extremely anisotropic layered cuprates .",
    "single crystals of bi , tl @xcite and hg @xcite based cuprates represent natural stacks of atomic scale intrinsic tunnel junctions . the intrinsic tunnelling spectroscopy ( its ) provides a unique opportunity to probe directly bulk electronic spectra of cuprates @xcite .",
    "tunneling mr is potentially a very powerful tool for analysis of superconducting features in electronic spectra .",
    "this was demonstrated in previous studies for cuprates @xcite as well as for conventional low-@xmath0 @xcite and non - cuprate @xcite high @xmath0 superconductors .",
    "application of magnetic field leads to appearance of a spatially inhomogeneous mixed state .",
    "this makes analysis of magnetotunneling data non - trivial @xcite and even counterintuitive @xcite .",
    "therefore , a clear understanding of how the magnetotunneling characteristics of josephson junctions should behave is needed for accurate data analysis .    in this work",
    "we perform detailed comparison of magnetotunneling in low-@xmath0 nb / alalox / nb , and slightly overdoped bi@xmath1pb@xmath2sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath4 [ bi(pb)-2212 ] intrinsic josephson junctions with theoretical calculations . small sizes of our bi(pb)-2212 mesas , which are one - two orders of magnitude smaller than in previous similar studies @xcite , in combination with the ability to extract information at the sub - gap bias with low dissipation power , lead to effective obviation of self - heating @xcite .",
    "both low- and high-@xmath0 junctions show qualitatively similar behavior .",
    "magnetic field and temperature suppress superconductivity in the state - conserving manner : enhancement of the sub - gap conductance due to suppression of @xmath16 is exactly compensated by reduction of the sum - gap conductance peak . as a result , the mr changes sign from the negative at the sub - gap voltages to the positive at the sum - gap @xmath17 .",
    "this allows us to trace closing of @xmath11 at @xmath9 with unprecedented clarity .",
    "we derive simple scaling laws for magnetotunneling and employ them for unambiguous extraction of superconducting parameters such as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the extracted @xmath19 decreases significantly upon approaching @xmath0 .",
    "our data indicates that superconductivity in slightly overdoped cuprates appears in a conventional manner by means of the second order phase transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the theoretical formalism , used for microscopic calculation of current - voltage ( @xmath20 ) characteristics in the mixed state .",

    "v we analyze scaling laws of different tunneling parameters as a function of @xmath22 and apply them for extraction of @xmath5 in nb - junctions .",

    "vii we summarize our conclusions .    [ cols=\"^,<,^ \" , ]      the only case where there is a certain disagreement between theory and experiment is @xmath23 at high fields in fig .",
    "[ fig5_nbbcssum ] ( a ) : experimental data at @xmath24  k and 4.7  k is clearly not reaching the normal conductance at @xmath25 . at higher fields it is not possible to measure junction characteristics because the nb electrodes are no longer capable to carry the supercurrent and turn into the resistive state .",
    "since the electrode resistance is several times larger than that of the junction , the measured resistance in this case is mostly given by the longitudinal resistances of the nb electrodes .",
    "this leads to the drastic decrease in the measured zero - bias conductance , as shown by thin solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig5_nbbcssum ] ( a ) . from this data",
    "it is obvious that some residual superconductivity in the nb electrodes is remaining up to fields significantly larger than @xmath5 .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig5_nbbcssum ] ( a ) shows the detailed view of the onset of the superconducting transition in nb electrodes .",
    "it is seen that at low @xmath24  k superconductivity in nb survives up to almost exactly @xmath26 , which is the expected value of the third critical field @xmath27 . at @xmath6",
    "superconductivity exists only in surface layers .",
    "a similar behavior has been reported in clean nb @xcite as well as in mgb@xmath3 @xcite . from the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig5_nbbcssum ] ( a ) it is seen that the ratio @xmath28 is decreasing with increasing temperature .",
    "a similar behavior was reported for clean nb and discussed in terms of a tricritical point @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that our nb films are in the dirty limit and are affected by the proximity effect with al .",
    "the columnar structure of sputtered nb films with a large effective surface - to - volume ratio and columns orientation perpendicular to the film may also enhance the role of surface superconductivity in the out - of - plane magnetic field .",
    "observation of a fairly conventional behavior of tunneling mr in overdoped bi(pb)-2212 encourage us to employ the derived scaling laws for extraction of the @xmath13-dependent upper critical field , which remains a controversial issue for cuprates , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the obtained scaling of the sum - gap peak voltage @xmath29 is valid not only for tunnel junctions made of @xmath30-wave superconductors . a similar scaling",
    "was also reported for @xmath31 in the mixed state of @xmath12-wave superconductors @xcite . in the remaining part of this work",
    "we apply the scaling rules for bi(pb)-2212 mesas in order to understand how normal or abnormal the behavior of intrinsic tunneling magnetoresistance is and in an attempt to estimate the upper critical field .          as seen from fig .",

    "[ fig3 iv_h_all ] ( d ) at @xmath35 k. here we also normalized the @xmath32 curves by that above @xmath0 .",
    "it is seen that the general behavior of the tunneling mr is the same as at low @xmath13 : the sub - gap conductance increases ( negative mr ) at the expense of the sum - gap conductance peak ( positive mr ) in the state - conserving manner .",
    "the corresponding peak resistances are shown by open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig6_ivh_ar ] ( a ) .",
    "however , the sum - gap peak is no longer moving to lower voltages with increasing @xmath21 , but instead spreads out to higher voltages . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a behavior is not totaly unusual . as a matter of fact the upturn of the peak voltage for high @xmath21 and @xmath13",
    "is also observed in theory and for nb / alalox / nb junctions , even though in a smaller scale , see curves at @xmath36 k in fig .",
    "[ fig5_nbbcssum ] ( d ) . as discussed above",
    ", the outward motion of the peak is the consequence of smearing of the peak in dos , rather than the actual increase of @xmath11 .",
    "this is also the reason why @xmath37 does not go to zero at @xmath38 , despite @xmath11 does vanish .",
    "figure [ fig6_ivh_ar ] ( c ) shows the ratio of conductances at @xmath39  t oriented parallel to @xmath40-planes ( which , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 iv_h_all ] ( d ) is equivalent to zero - field ) and in the @xmath15-axis direction .",
    "such a normalization perfectly removes all field independent features and allows observation with unprecedented clarity superconducting parts of the spectra at @xmath9 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6_ivh_ar ] ( c ) we clearly see the sum - gap peak at @xmath41 k , which is practically indistinguishable in @xmath32 characteristics . remarkably , we can observe the peak even at @xmath42  k ( see the inset ) , which is above the critical temperature for appearance of phase - coherence in the @xmath15-axis direction @xmath43 k. apparently the superconducting gap is still present at 95 k , but its value is rapidly decreasing at this temperature , as it does in bcs theory close to the mean - field @xmath44 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2_ivvst_h0_all ] ( f ) .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that superconductivity in near optimally doped bi-2212 appears by means of the second - order phase transition in the conventional bcs - manner .",

    "it is seen that in a wide bias range ( an order of magnitude ) @xmath49 have the same magnitude and disappears in a linear manner at @xmath38 .",
    "this fairly good and almost bias - independent scaling is the consequence of the almost parallel shift of @xmath20s ( in the semi - logarithmic scale ) with increasing @xmath21 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 iv_h_all ]  ( c ) , .",
    "the @xmath32 curves behave in the same manner , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig3 iv_h_all ]  ( d ) demonstrates that for bi(pb)-2212 such parallel translation of @xmath20 curves is even more impressive and expands to almost two orders of magnitude in bias current .",
