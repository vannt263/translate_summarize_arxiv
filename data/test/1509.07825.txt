    "the ads - cft correspondence , proposed by maldacena @xcite , has generated a flurry of activity both in high energy and condensed matter physics since it can address issues in strongly interacting systems in the latter ( that are otherwise intractable in conventional condensed matter framework ) , by exploiting results obtained in weakly coupled systems in the former .",
    "notable example of a strongly coupled condensed matter system is the high @xmath0 superconductor , some of whose generic features have been recovered from weakly coupled gravity systems by exploiting the ads - cft correspondence .",
    "in particular , there exists explicit mapping between relevant operators and parameters of a field theory in the bulk ads space - time to those of a conformal field theory living in the ( one dimension lower ) boundary .",
    "it was shown by gubser @xcite that a simple theory of abelian higgs model in ads space can lead to a spontaneous symmetry breaking thereby inducing scalar hair near the black hole horizon .",
    "the ads - cft correspondence and its associated dictionary can lead to interesting analogies with thin - film superconductors .",
    "in particular , the black hole hawking temperature and hair is identified with the superconductor temperature and the condensate , respectively .",
    "a still simpler variant that captures the essential physics of holographic superconductors was considered by hartnoll , herzog and horowitz @xcite , who took the so called probe limit where the maxwell field and the scalar field do not generate back reactions on the metric .",
    "operationally , this means that one can consider the effect of schwarzschild - ads metric on scalar and maxwell fields , instead of taking the background metric to be reissner - nordstrom in ads . afterwards the reissner - nordstrom metric was also considered in @xcite ( for a detailed review see @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the work initiated in our previous letter @xcite in that we now include effects of an external magnetic field on the non - commutativity ( nc ) induced generalized ads - cft correspondence proposed in @xcite .",
    "specifically , our aim is to study the effects of non - commutative ( nc ) geometry on ads - cft correspondence and subsequently on the properties of holographic superconductors , in the presence of both bulk electric and magnetic fields . in this context",
    ", the backreaction of the matter field on the metric is assumed to be suppressed by considering the probe limit .    in condensed matter scenario",
    "magnetic field plays an important role since the behavior of a superconductor in external magnetic field distinguishes it being type i or type ii . in general magnetic field is expelled out of the superconductor : the well known meissner effect .",
    "this is captured by the following law , @xmath1.\\ ] ] the critical magnetic field @xmath2 decreases as temperature @xmath3 gets closer to the critical temperature @xmath0 and vanishes for @xmath4 indicating the superconducting state ceases to exist beyond @xmath0 . for temperatures lower than @xmath0",
    "the system can withstand the external magnetic field up to @xmath2 .",
    "thus the critical magnetic field @xmath5 turns out to be an important parameter of the theory .",
    "when the external magnetic field exceeds @xmath5 , it starts to penetrate the superconductor but for type i the process is abrupt ( a first order phase transition ) whereas for type ii the process is gradual with formation of vortices of quantized flux ( a second order phase transition ) .",
    "the high @xmath0 superconductors fall in the type ii category .",
    "this feature is reproduced in the ads - cft analysis as well .",
    "non - commutativity in space - time was introduced long ago by snyder @xcite with the motivation of removing short distance singularities in quantum field theory but it was not successful .",
    "later on , nc field theory was resurrected by seiberg and witten @xcite , who demonstrated that in the low energy limit open strings , attached to @xmath6-brans , induced noncommutativity in the @xmath6-brans . in @xcite rules were provided for extending qfts to nc qfts , where normal products between local fields were replaced by @xmath7-products so that nc qfts can be studied perturbatively for small nc parameter @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nc gauge theories had to be treated in a special way by incorporating the seiberg - witten map @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "recently nicolini , smailagic and spalucci @xcite have given a new nc extension of schwarzschild metric by directly solving the einstein s equation with a smeared matter source , which has the form of a gaussian distribution that incorporate the nc effect through a minimum length scale @xmath8.sometimes @xmath9 is identified as the planck length .",
    "the black hole singularity was successfully removed in this scenario . in a sense , the original motivation of snyder @xcite was partly fulfilled by removing the black hole singularity in classical general relativity through quantum effects .",
    "nc effects on salient features of black hole , such as hawking radiation , have been studied using this @xmath8-corrected metric @xcite . in these analysis @xmath8",
    "is the nc parameter . hawking",
    "- page crossover with such nc black hole metric in ads has been studied in @xcite .",
    "recently , effects of noncommutativity on thermalization processes for the nc black hole backgrounds have been studied in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we will study the bulk nc effect on holographic superconductors in the probe limit approximation .",
    "our computations closely follow the analytical framework of @xcite as exploited by @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps significant that ( at least to the lowest non - trivial order of @xmath8 ) nc effect does not change the asymptotic behaviors of bulk fields in a qualitative way .",
    "this means that the functional forms remain unchanged whereas the numerical parameters can undergo nc corrections .",
    "this allows us to use the same ads - cft dictionary in order to compute the @xmath8-corrected relation between the critical temperature and the charge density of the holographic superconductor and thereafter the condensate - temperature relation .",
    "as we have mentioned our results are consistent in the probe limit domain and reduce to the conventional results if the nc effects are removed although the last part is achieved by a tricky limiting procedure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the nc - ads black hole metric by defining the action for an abelian gauge field coupled with a higgs scalar in this nc background . here , we obtain the field equations and we study the asymptotic behavior of the gauge and scalar fields . depending on these field equations in section 3",
    "we proceed to analyze the relation between the critical temperature and the charge density , and subsequently obtain the expression of the condensation operator .",
    "afterward , in section 4 we introduce an external magnetic field in the bulk and find the expression of the critical magnetic field for the nc holographic superconductor .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 5 by summarizing our results and mentioning some open problems .",
    "the present section is used to fix the notation and framework and consists of a recapitulation of the results used in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "we start with the conventional action integral in ads space - time background given by @xmath11 , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the radius of ads , @xmath13 the maxwell field in non - commutative background and @xmath14 the charged scaler higgs . throughout in this paper , we work in the system of natural unit with @xmath15 .    in nc background the black hole is considered to have matter and charge density in the form of a gaussian distribution as proposed in @xcite and for the ansatz @xmath16 , @xmath17 , variation of the above action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric tensor @xmath18 provides the charged black hole solution in ads as @xcite @xmath19+\\frac{r^2}{l^2}. \\label{metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath20 is the lower incomplete gamma function and @xmath21 the curvature which can take the values @xmath22 according to planar , spherical and hyperbolic space - time , respectively . it can be noted that as @xmath23 , the above metric ( [ metric ] ) reduces to the usual ads form .    in this paper , we will concentrate on large black holes , i.e. for which @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the radius of the horizon . outside the horizon",
    ", we can therefore consider @xmath26 , which approximates the gamma function to give an exponential function .",
    "since we are interested in studying the asymptotic behavior of ads , and restrict ourselves to the probe limit , the @xmath27-dependent back reaction terms are not considered further in @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , in this case , the metric is restricted to the form , @xmath29 thus nc corrections will enter only through @xmath28 .",
    "now , variations of the above action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the scalar field @xmath30 and the gauge field @xmath31 provide the governing equation for our system as @xmath32    asymptotically , as @xmath33 the term @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the metric coefficient @xmath28 in ( [ metric-2 ] ) can be approximated as @xmath35 ( considering terms up to @xmath36 only ) . with this approximation",
    ", the asymptotic behavior of the scalar field @xmath30 can be find to be @xmath37 here , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are constants and can be considered alternatively as a source and value of the condensate @xmath40 , respectively . in the article , we consider @xmath41 and @xmath42 , i.e. there will be condensation without any source term",
    ".    using the same approximation @xmath35 , the asymptotic behavior of the gauge field @xmath43 turns out to be @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are constants and can be considered respectively as the chemical potential and the charge density .",
    "notice that , the effects of non - commutativity are not present in both the above asymptotic behavior of the scalar fields @xcite .",
    "however , later on we will show that the effects of non - commutativity will appear through the near horizon solutions of @xmath30 and @xmath43 .",
    "in this section we recover the results obtained in our previous paper @xcite but now with a more straightforward analytical method as appliied in @xcite . changing the variable from @xmath47 to @xmath48 the above set of equations ( [ diff - si],[diff - fi ] ) turn out to be , @xmath49    * boundary conditions : *    * as , @xmath50 , so , in order to make the quantity @xmath51 finite and to obtain a regular solution of the scalar field @xmath30 at @xmath52 , we have the horizon boundary conditions for @xmath43 and @xmath30 respectively as @xmath53    with the above expressions ( [ diff - si-1],[diff - fi-1 ] ) in hand , we now aim to derive an analytic expression for the critical temperature and the condensation values in non - commutative background . since , all of @xmath43 , @xmath30 and @xmath54 are regular at the horizon , we can taylor expand them near @xmath52 , respectively as @xmath55 without loss of generality we can choose @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite .    using these taylor expansions , near @xmath58 from ( [ diff - fi-1 ] ) we obtain , @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",

    "we elaborate briefly on the figures [ fig-1 ] and [ fig-2 ] .    in figure [ fig-1 ]",

    "this result shows that in this nc scenario the critical value of the magnetic field actually reduces from normal case . from figure [ pic-2-b ]",
    "one can clearly see this result .",

    "for this reason , it is crucial to note that in this nc scenario the critical magnetic field @xmath5 vanishes before the temperature @xmath3 reaches the critical value @xmath0 .",
    "we have studied an extended form of ads - cft correspondence by introducing non - commutative geometry effects by considering a non - commutative generalization of the asymptotic ads black hole solution . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have studied such nc effects on holographic superconductors in the presence of electric field only . in the present work exploiting an analytic formulation we have studied the nc effects on holographic superconductors in the presence of a constant external magnetic field .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the probe limit and to the lowest non - trivial order in nc parameter .",
    "our findings are summarized below .",
    "we find that the basic features of ads - cft correspondence and holographic superconductors remain intact under non - commutative geometry , ( at least to the order of approximations considered here ) .",
    "but the critical parameters undergo nc corrections in an interesting and non - trivial way . apart from the modifications in the numerical values of the parameters , more interestingly ,",
    "the parameters depend on the nc parameter @xmath9 in a non - linear way and reaches a peak value depending on a dimensionless combination of @xmath9 and the black hole mass @xmath139 .",
    "the appearance of mass parameters is in itself interesting and nicely corroborated with ( some of our ) previous observations on nc corrections in completely different context .",
    "our main conclusion is that non - commutative effects tend to work against black hole hair formation which in turn shows its negative effect on holographic superconductors in two ways : it reduces the critical magnetic field value and furthermore the critical magnetic field vanishes slightly before the temperature reaches its critical value .",
    "there are several open problems along which one can proceed further .",
    "we expect non - commutative effects to significantly affect properties of holographic superconductors in a qualitative way once we go beyond the probe limit and include back reaction .",
    "the other area we wish to investigate in near future is the transport properties where non - commutative effects can have non - trivial consequences .",

    "<S> in this work , the effects of magnetic field on a holographic superconductor have been studied in non - commutative background through the ads - cft correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> the non - commutative correction has been incorporated here is the generalization of the schwarzschild black hole metric in ads . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that the non - commutative effects tend to work against the black hole hair formation . </S>",
