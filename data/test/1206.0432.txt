    "in recent years , more and more effort has been devoted to finding and studying field theories which are candidates for effective descriptions of multiple m - branes .",
    "inspired by the proposal of basu and harvey@xcite of an m - theory version of the nahm equation , bagger and lambert@xcite and independently gustavsson@xcite ( blg ) found a three - dimensional chern - simons matter theory with @xmath0 supersymmetry that is invariant under parity transformations .",
    "this theory was based on a matter multiplet taking values in a 3-lie algebra@xcite and a topological gauge field with a natural action on the matter fields .",
    "it was soon realized that the number of 3-lie algebras with desirable properties , such as admitting a positive definite metric , is very limited and generalizations of the blg model were sought .",
    "the most promising such generalization is the aharony - bergman - jafferis - maldacena ( abjm ) model@xcite , which is again a chern - simons matter theory . in this model",
    "the matter fields live in the bifundamental representation of the product gauge group @xmath1 , which is endowed with a metric of split signature .",
    "one can , however , rewrite the abjm model in 3-algebra language if one uses a generalization of 3-lie algebras known as hermitian 3-algebras@xcite .",
    "it seems that supersymmetry in the abjm model is reduced to @xmath2 , which makes it less appealing than the blg model .",
    "this could be remedied by the inclusion of monopole operators , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "furthermore , the abjm model passed a non - trivial consistency check when the scaling @xmath3 of the degrees of freedom with the number @xmath4 of m2-branes was reproduced@xcite . for",
    "a comprehensive review of m2-brane models , see @xcite .",
    "given that there is now a reasonable candidate for the description of multiple m2-branes , it is clearly tempting to look for a similar candidate for the effective description of multiple m5-branes .",
    "there are various arguments in the literature suggesting that such a theory has to be intrinsically quantum and that it should not possess a lagrangian description@xcite .",
    "however , recent results suggest that there might be loopholes to these arguments , as e.g.  the inclusion of non - local components in the model@xcite .    as mentioned above , the development of the m2-brane models used as a guideline the basu - harvey equation that captures the dynamics of self - dual strings , i.e.  m2-branes ending on m5-branes .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that the description of self - dual strings from the perspective of the m5-branes might shed light on potential m5-brane models .",
    "moreover , self - dual strings are interesting by themselves , as they should lead to new integrable models with a wealth of non - trivial mathematical structures behind them .    in the following",
    ", we will review a description of self - dual strings using loop space@xcite .",
    "loop space appears very naturally within m - theory , as one can see by the following nave argument : recall that the interactions of d - branes are governed by fundamental strings , whose endpoints induce an effective theory on the set of points in the d - branes worldvolume .",
    "the interactions of m5-branes , however , are governed by m2-branes , whose boundaries form loops called self - dual strings in the m5-branes worldvolume .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect an effective description on the loop space of the worldvolume .",
    "the use of loop space in m - theory has been advocated before@xcite .",
    "moreover , loop space equations for self - dual strings ( which differ from the ones presented here ) have been proposed@xcite .",
    "we will give more arguments in favor of a loop space description of m5-branes in the last section .",
    "a configuration of ( flat ) m2-branes ending on m5-branes corresponds in string theory to d2-branes ending on d4-branes or d1-branes ending on d3-branes .",
    "the latter configuration has been identified@xcite as the string theory interpretation of the atiyah - drinfeld - hitchin - manin - nahm ( adhmn ) construction of monopoles@xcite .",
    "the loop space description of self - dual strings that we present in the following is a rather literal lift of the original adhmn construction to m - theory .",
    "there are quite a few interesting structures related to the adhmn construction , such as twistor descriptions , lax pairs , spectral curves , etc .",
    "our m - theory lift of the adhmn construction should therefore allow us to find the m - theory analogues of these structures .",
    "we will list some more recent results related to this point in the last section .    as a further motivation for loop space",
    ", we also review the reformulation@xcite of a set of equations of motion that was proposed@xcite as an effective description of m5-branes on loop space .",
    "this reformulation leads to natural interpretations for some of the fields appearing in these equations as well as for some of the equations themselves .",
    "the bps equations in this model essentially agree with the self - dual string equation on loop space .",
    "this review is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we recall the definition of self - dual strings as well as their description from the perspective of the m2-branes in terms of the basu - harvey equation .",
    "just as monopoles can be seen as characteristic classes of principal fiber bundles , self - dual strings yield characteristic classes of abelian gerbes , which we review in section 3 .",
    "section 4 discusses the lift of an abelian gerbe to a line bundle over loop space , which yields a loop space version of the self - dual string equation . in section 5 ,",
    "we demonstrate how to lift all the ingredients in the adhmn construction of monopoles to m - theory .",
    "we also perform a few consistency checks and demonstrate that this lift reduces to the adhmn construction in a very natural way .",
    "section 6 gives a brief impression of how the construction of section 5 is extended to self - dual strings in the abjm model . in section 7 , we review the loop space interpretation of a proposal of m5-brane equations .",
    "we close in section 8 by summarizing the presented results and putting them into the context of some more recent findings related to m - theory .",
    "as stated in the introduction , it was the study of the bps equation for multiple m2-branes@xcite that ultimately led to the construction of the blg model@xcite .",
    "analogously , one might hope that studying the bps equations for multiple m5-branes might provide crucial hints on their effective description .",
    "this motivates the study of self - dual strings@xcite and their non - abelian extensions . in this section",
    ", we provide a concise review of the self - dual string soliton and its relation to monopoles .",
    "we start from a d - brane configuration of @xmath5 d1-branes ending on a d3-brane .",
    "the worldvolumes of the branes extend in ten - dimensional flat target space of type iib superstring theory as follows : @xmath6 we have coordinates @xmath7 , and , as usual , we mostly write @xmath8 instead of @xmath9 .",
    "the symbol @xmath10 indicates that the d1-branes end on the d3-brane located at @xmath11 . in the following",
    ", we will be interested in the vacua of this configuration .    from the perspective of the d3-brane",
    ", the endpoints of the d1-branes appear like @xmath5 dirac monopoles .",
    "the configuration is thus described by the _ bogomolny monopole equation _",
    "@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the curvature of the electromagnetic potential @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the higgs field of the monopole configuration .    from the perspective of the d1-brane ,",
    "however , the configuration is described by the _",
    "nahm equation_@xcite @xmath16~.\\ ] ] the @xmath17 are scalar fields taking values in the adjoint representation of @xmath18 and describe the fluctuations of the @xmath5 d1-branes in the directions parallel to the worldvolume of the d3-branes .",
    "note that the configuration is invariant under @xmath19 rotations in the @xmath20-directions , and this is reflected in the nahm equation .",
    "both descriptions are linked by the nahm transform@xcite .",
    "one can see this link very explicitly when comparing solutions to the bogomolny monopole equation and the nahm equation .",
    "note that @xmath12 , together with the bianchi identity , implies that @xmath15 is a harmonic function on @xmath21 , where we allow for sources at the positions of the monopoles .",
    "for a monopole at @xmath22 , we therefore have a higgs field @xmath23 , where @xmath5 is the _ monopole charge _ and the number of d1-branes . on the other hand",
    ", we find a simple solution to the nahm equation by factorizing @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . plugging this ansatz into",
    ", we obtain @xmath26~.\\ ] ] this solution is called the _ fuzzy funnel_@xcite : equations imply that the @xmath27 form a representation of @xmath28 , which suggests to interpret them as coordinates on a fuzzy sphere @xmath29 .",
    "the radius of this sphere is given by the function @xmath30 .",
    "thus , each point in the worldvolume of the d1-branes polarizes into a fuzzy sphere with a radius that diverges at @xmath31 . because the higgs field @xmath15 describes fluctuations of the d3-brane s worldvolume in the @xmath32-direction ( and therefore the coordinate @xmath8",
    "should be identified with @xmath15 ) , the profile of the d1-branes given by @xmath30 agrees precisely with that given by the higgs field from the d3-brane s perspective .",
    "let us now lift this configuration to m - theory . for this , we t - dualize along @xmath33 and interpret @xmath34 as the m - theory direction .",
    "we arrive at the configuration @xmath35 here , the boundary of the m2-branes in the m5-brane s worldvolume looks like a string .",
    "together with the self - duality of the three - form curvature in the m5-brane s worldvolume , this led to the name _ self - dual string_. we will assume that the boundary of the m2-brane is stable in the @xmath33-direction , and therefore restrict our attention to the @xmath36-directions .",
    "from the perspective of the m5-brane , the vacua of the configuration are described by the self - dual string equation@xcite @xmath37 .",
    "the configuration is obviously invariant under @xmath38 rotations in the @xmath36-directions , and this should be reflected in the extension of the nahm equation .",
    "basu and harvey therefore suggested essentially the following equation@xcite @xmath39~.\\ ] ] here , we assume that the bracket @xmath40 $ ] is totally antisymmetric and linear in each slot . before discussing this 3-algebra structure in any further detail , let us briefly compare the profiles of the scalar fields in the two descriptions .",
    "we make again a product ansatz @xmath41 and plug it into .",
    "the solution is @xmath42~.\\ ] ] on the other hand , the self - dual string equation @xmath43 implies that @xmath15 is a harmonic function on @xmath44 with sources at the location of the self - dual string .",
    "we therefore have @xmath45 , which is again compatible with the profile obtained from the solution given in .    the components @xmath46 of the solution @xmath47 take values in a _",
    "3-lie algebra_@xcite : they are elements in a vector space @xmath48 endowed with a totally antisymmetric trilinear bracket @xmath40:{\\mathcal{a}}^{\\wedge 3}\\rightarrow { \\mathcal{a}}$ ]",
    ". we also impose the _ fundamental identity _ , @xmath49=[[a , b , c],d , e]+[c,[a , b , d],e]+[c , d,[a , b , e]]~,\\ ] ] which plays the role of a higher jacobi identity .",
    "it guarantees that the inner derivations @xmath50 spanned by the operators @xmath51 with @xmath52 $ ] , @xmath53 , form a lie algebra .",
    "this lie algebra can be used as a gauge algebra in the basu - harvey equation : analogously to the nahm equation , we can write in gauge covariant form after introducing a gauge potential @xmath54 taking values in @xmath50 : @xmath55~.\\ ] ]    the most prominent example of a 3-lie algebra is the 3-lie algebra @xmath56 whose generators @xmath57 , @xmath58 , satisfy the relation @xmath59={{\\varepsilon}}_{\\mu\\nu\\kappa\\lambda}\\tau_\\lambda~.\\ ] ] it underlies the solution , and its lie algebra of inner derivations @xmath60 is @xmath38 .",
    "the basu - harvey equation is a bps equation in the blg model@xcite , a chern - simons matter theory with @xmath0 supersymmetry that was proposed as a candidate for the effective description of stacks of multiple m2-branes . in this theory , the matter supermultiplet , which takes values in a 3-lie algebra ,",
    "is coupled to a chern - simons action . to write down an action for this theory , it is necessary to equip the 3-lie algebra with a metric structure .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath61 and its direct sums are the only examples of finite - dimensional 3-lie algebras that can be endowed with a positive definite , @xmath50-invariant metric .",
    "generalizations of 3-lie algebras were therefore proposed that relax the total antisymmetry of the 3-bracket@xcite . _",

    ", we have again a lie algebra of inner derivations and we can construct chern - simons matter theories using them . in the case of hermitian 3-algebras ,",

    "more details on 3-algebras can be found in @xcite .",
    "all our constructions in the following can be applied to models using real or hermitian 3-algebras .",
    "while monopoles are described in terms of certain connections on principal fiber bundles , self - dual strings are described by certain connective structures on ( abelian ) gerbes . to explain this statement ,",

    "as mentioned above , the only finite - dimensional example of a 3-lie algebra with all physically desirable properties is @xmath61 .",

    "the covariant derivatives @xmath235 , however , acts only on the zero - modes of the fields : @xmath236 and this should be extended to a full loop space derivative . at the moment",
    ", it is not clear how to do this while preserving supersymmetry .    to compare this model with our generalization of the adhmn construction",
    ", we can derive the bps equations from the supersymmetry transformations on loop space .",
    "this yields indeed the ultra - local part of the loop space self - dual string equation .",
    "the adhmn - like construction we reviewed above arose very naturally from the assumption that self - dual strings should be described in terms of loop space : the necessary lift of the dirac operator of the original construction as well as the non - abelian generalization of the equation were readily derived .",
    "also , the basu - harvey equation features in the construction exactly in the expected way and takes over the role the nahm equation played in the original adhmn construction .",
    "explicit examples of solutions to the loop space self - dual string equation can be constructed . moreover , the reduction to the adhmn construction of monopoles is rather obvious .",
    "our construction extends to the more general real and hermitian 3-algebras , and it is therefore compatible with the abjm model .",
    "also , we obtained naturally a gauge group structure @xmath237 , which fits well with a recent proposals for m5-brane equations@xcite .    besides the nave argument for the appearance of loop space given in the introduction , there is further evidence that this approach is appropriate .",
    "first of all , the notion of a monopole bag together with the associated nahm construction have been lifted to m - theory@xcite . recall that a monopole bag is a double - scaling limit of infinitely many monopoles forming a surface diffeomorphic to a sphere , where the ratio of the monopole number and the yang - mills coupling constant is kept fixed . in this double - scaling limit , all equations become abelian , and the description of self - dual string bags is therefore known .",
    "it was checked that the infinite - charge nahm construction has a loop space version , which produces solutions to an abelian form of the loop space self - dual string equation@xcite .",
    "further motivation for the use of loop space also comes from a different perspective .",
    "one might wonder about the interpretation of the fuzzy funnel in the case of m2-branes ending on m5-branes . recall that in the @xmath19-invariant situation of d1-branes ending on d3-branes , the points in the worldvolume of the d1-branes polarize into fuzzy two - spheres .",
    "analogously one would expect that points on m2-branes polarize into fuzzy three - spheres . a satisfyingly precise notion of fuzzy 3-spheres",
    "is so far unknown . roughly speaking",
    ", the prequantum line bundle over @xmath77 should be replaced by a prequantum gerbe over @xmath91 .",
    "the hilbert space of the quantization , which in the case of @xmath77 is given by global holomorphic sections of the prequantum line bundle , should here be obtained from global holomorphic sections of the prequantum gerbe .",
    "while the latter notion seems rather opaque , one can transgress the problem to loop space : the loop space @xmath238 of @xmath91 carries the structure of a khler manifold@xcite , and the prequantum gerbe over @xmath91 is transgressed to a prequantum line bundle over @xmath238 .",
    "one can then quantized ( a subset of the ) functions on the space @xmath238 by identifying them with linear operators on the space of global holomorphic sections of the transgressed abelian gerbe over @xmath91 .",
    "such an approach to quantization has been suggested previously@xcite , where it was used to quantize the loop space of @xmath21 .",
    "it could be shown that the quantization of the loop space reduces as expected to the moyal quantization of @xmath239 upon imposing the usual restrictions reducing m - theory to string theory .",
    "the fact that an adhmn - like construction for self - dual strings exists at all is by now no longer surprising .",
    "underlying both the original adhm and adhmn constructions are corresponding twistor geometric interpretations of the instanton and monopole equations . here",
    ", a penrose - ward transform establishes a bijection between certain holomorphic bundles over a twistor space and solutions to the relevant equations .",
    "quite recently , a twistor space was found@xcite , that yields a bijection between certain holomorphic gerbes on this twistor space and ( abelian ) solutions to the self - dual string equation . in principle",
    "it is possible to transgress this picture to loop space and to obtain the twistor picture underlying our loop space self - dual string equation .",
    "moreover , the twistor construction using abelian gerbes@xcite has recently been extended to the non - abelian case@xcite .",
    "we therefore know that a full adhmn - like construction of self - dual strings based on ordinary space and non - abelian gerbes has to exist .",
    "the existence of our construction leads to another question .",
    "recall that the adhmn construction is a special case of a nahm transform mapping instanton solutions on a four - torus to instanton solutions on the dual four - torus .",
    "it is therefore a map between solutions to the same theory on different spaces and in the special case of the adhmn construction , one has a map between solutions to dimensional reductions of the instanton equation . therefore one would also expect the m - theory lift to be a map between solutions to closely related theories .",
    "the basu - harvey equation and the self - dual string equation , however , appear to be very different .",
    "a first step towards resolving this issue is the observation that all 3-lie algebras ( as well as the generalized real and hermitian 3-algebras ) are special cases of differential crossed modules or strict lie 2-algebras@xcite .",
    "these strict lie 2-algebras , in turn , are structure groups of categorified principal bundles , which contain in particular non - abelian gerbes as special cases . assuming that the gauge structure of the m5-brane model yet to be found will be defined by a non - abelian gerbe , we can conclude that at least the gauge structure of both m2- and m5-brane models do agree .",
    "moreover , in the m2-brane model the gauge two - form curvature carries no degrees of freedom , as it is fixed via the equations of motion by the matter fields .",
    "something analogous happens when working with non - abelian gerbes : here , a gauge two - form curvature is fixed by the two - form potential via the so - called fake curvature condition and just as in chern - simons matter theories , the gauge field does not carry any additional degrees of freedom .",
    "altogether , it seems that m2- and m5-brane models might not be as different as it appeared initially .",
    "this , together with the fact that more and more m5-brane models are being proposed@xcite , gives reason for careful optimism about the existence of an effective description of m5-branes .",
    "i would like to thank sam palmer and costis papageorgakis for very pleasant collaborations on the papers@xcite that i reviewed here .",
    "moreover , i am grateful to sergey cherkis for the invitation to berkeley as well as for many inspiring and entertaining discussions .",
