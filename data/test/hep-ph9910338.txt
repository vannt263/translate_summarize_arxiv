    "the next linear collider ( nlc ) will explore @xmath1 processes in the tev energy regime , and probe the standard model of elementary particles to great accuracy .",
    "electroweak processes which may reveal new physics , such as supersymmetry , are especially interesting .",
    "therefore the accurate calculation of the scattering amplitudes of such high energy processes in the standard model is very important .",
    "the main corrections to the born amplitudes at high energies , @xmath2 , are double logarithmic ( dl ) contributions of the form @xmath3 which arise from soft vector boson exchanges . here",
    "we derive the dl asymptotics of scattering amplitudes , for a sequence of gauge theories leading up to the standard electroweak model .",
    "the dl correction for qed processes dates back many years to the paper by sudakov @xcite . in section 2",
    "we present the original sudakov form factor for qed in a form in which it can be generalized to non - abelian gauge theories , a subject to which we then turn .",
    "we start with the processes where all the scalar products @xmath4 of the momenta of participating particles are of the same order . in section 3",
    "we compute the dl corrections to processes governed by massless non - abelian gauge theories , and then , in section 4 , we turn to the interesting case of broken gauge symmetries , discussing , in particular , the dl effects for standard model electroweak processes .    in all these cases",
    "the dl terms can be resummed in exponential forms which are generalizations of @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the probability of the emission of a soft and quasi - collinear gauge boson from an external particle @xmath7 , and the summation is over all @xmath8 external charged particles participating in the process .",
    "the virtual particles are subject to an infrared cut - off @xmath9 on their transverse momenta .",
    "we use an equation for the evolution of the scattering amplitudes as a function of the infrared cut - off @xmath9 of the transverse momenta of virtual particles .",
    "our approach is based on a gauge invariant dispersive method which is a generalization of a powerful theorem on photon bremsstrahlung due to gribov @xcite .",
    "his remarkable theorem , proved by dispersive methods , states that , due to gauge invariance , the region of applicability of well known formulas for accompanying photon bremsstrahlung is considerably extended at high energies . in these formulas the amplitude for a process with the emission of a soft photon is expressed , in a factorized form , in terms of the amplitude for the non - radiative process , with the particles taken _ on - mass - shell_. since the amplitude is taken on - shell , _ gauge invariance _ is guaranteed .",
    "the evolution equation approach greatly simplifies the computation of dl effects for electroweak processes , which are mediated by broken symmetry with the photon having components in both the @xmath10(2 ) and @xmath11(1 ) gauge groups .",
    "the evolution equations for the amplitude as a function of the infrared cut - off parameter @xmath12 are analogous to the renormalization group equations ( rge ) .",
    "basically we start from the domain of very large @xmath12 , where the born amplitude applies , and evolve down to small @xmath12 , matching the solution at the mass thresholds bounding every new kinematic domain .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the structure of the exponentiation of the dl effects has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "of course for observable processes it is necessary to consider the dl corrections to both the non - radiative and the radiative processes . for radiative processes we again have exponentiation of the sudakov dl corrections in a form similar to ( [ eq : a1 ] ) . the dependence on the infrared cut - off parameter @xmath9 is canceled in the measurable semi - inclusive process , and is replaced by a dependence on the experimental acceptance cuts on the soft boson emissions . in sections 3.1 , 4.1 and 4.2 we address these issues .    as well as",
    "dl corrections of the sudakov type , there are dl contributions specific to forward or backward scattering , when a final particle is quasi - collinear to an initial particle and their energies are almost equal .",
    "this is the domain of regge kinematics and is the subject of section 5 .",
    "here we have the dl corrections related to the exchange of soft pairs of fermions or of bosons in the crossed channel .",
    "the infrared evolution equations are now non - linear in the amplitude , and in the @xmath13-plane representation are of ricatti - type form . in simple cases",
    "the latter forms can be reduced to a schrdinger - type equation with a harmonic potential .",
    "this approach can also be applied to production processes in the multi - regge kinematics . in this case",
    "the evolution equations are solved in a sequence of domains starting from the region where the born amplitude applies and evolving down in the cut - off @xmath9 to the region where soft particles are emitted .",
    "the vector boson and fermion reggeization can be also easily verified in the dl approximation .",
    "moreover , the infrared evolution equation allows the construction of scattering amplitudes with quasi - elastic unitarity .",
    "the high energy asymptotics of electromagnetic processes was calculated many years ago within the framework of qed @xcite@xcite . in particular the amplitude for @xmath1 elastic scattering at a fixed angle ( @xmath14 a fictitious plays the role of the infrared cut - off . in physical cross sections the divergence in @xmath15 of the elastic amplitude is canceled with the analogous divergences in processes with soft photon emissions . ]",
    "photon mass ) in the dl approximation has the form @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the born amplitude for @xmath1 scattering and @xmath18 is the sudakov form factor .",
    "the dl approximation applies in the energy regime @xmath19 where the qed coupling @xmath20 .",
    "thus each charged external particle effectively contributes @xmath21 to the total amplitude .",
    "the sudakov form factor appears in the elastic scattering of an electron off an external field @xcite .",
    "it is of the form : @xmath22 to specify @xmath23 it is convenient to use the sudakov parametrization of the momentum of the exchanged virtual photon : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the initial and final momenta of the scattered electron .",
    "@xmath27 can then be written as the integral over @xmath28 and @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the first two factors in the integrand correspond to the propagators of the virtual fermions which occur in the one - loop triangle sudakov diagram .",
    "the @xmath32 - function appears as a result of the integration of the propagator of the photon over its transverse momentum @xmath33 , noting that the main contribution comes from the region near the photon mass shell @xcite : @xmath34 to dl accuracy ( 6 ) gives for @xmath35 : @xmath36 where the result comes equally from two different kinematical regions , @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ". therefore one can write @xmath39 .",
    "we can obtain physical insight by presenting the two equal contributions separately . in the first region , with @xmath40 ,",
    "the virtual photon is emitted along @xmath25 and the parameter @xmath29 is given by the ratio of energies of the photon and the initial electron . here instead of @xmath28 , it is convenient to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : kp ] ) to replace it by the square of the transverse momentum component of the photon .",
    "then integrating over @xmath29 and @xmath41 gives @xmath42 in the dl approximation , which may be evaluated to give half of @xmath23 .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is proportional to the probability @xmath44 of the emission of a soft and almost collinear photon from an external particle with energy @xmath2 and mass @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 if several charged particles participate in a process , for example @xmath47 , then analogous contributions appear for each external line , provided all external invariants are large and of the same order .",
    "this leads to the general result @xmath48 where @xmath8 is the number of external lines corresponding to charged particles . in summary",
    "the soft emissions described by the sudakov form factor is a quasi - classical effect which does not depend on the hard dynamics of the process .",
    "in particular there are no quantum mechanical interference effects in the dl sudakov corrections , for large scattering angles .",
    "sudakov effects have been widely discussed for non - abelian gauge theories , such as @xmath49 and can be calculated in various ways ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider here the scattering amplitude in the simplest kinematics when all its invariants @xmath50 are large and of the same order @xmath51 .",
    "a general method of finding the dl asymptotics ( not only of the sudakov type ) is based on the infrared evolution equations describing the dependence of the amplitudes on the infrared cutoff @xmath9 of the virtual particle transverse momenta @xcite .",
    "this cutoff plays the same role as @xmath52 in qed , but , unlike @xmath52 , it is not necessary that it vanishes and it may take an arbitrary value .",
    "it can be introduced in a gauge invariant way by working , for instance , in a finite phase space volume in the transverse direction with linear size @xmath53 . instead of calculating asymptotics of particular feynman diagrams and summing these asymptotics for a process with @xmath8 external lines it is convenient to extract the virtual particle with the smallest value of @xmath54 in such a way , that the transverse momenta @xmath55 of the other virtual particles are much bigger @xmath56 for the other particles @xmath57 plays the role of the initial infrared cut - off @xmath58 .    in particular , the sudakov dl corrections",
    "are related to the exchange of soft gauge bosons , see fig .  1 .",
    "for this case the integral over the momentum @xmath59 of the soft ( i.e. @xmath60 ) virtual boson with the smallest @xmath61 can be factored off , which leads to the following infrared evolution equation : @xmath62 where the amplitude @xmath63 on the right hand side is to be taken on the mass shell , but with the substituted infrared cutoff : @xmath64 .",
    "the generator @xmath65 acts on the color indices of the particle with momentum @xmath66 .",
    "the non - abelian gauge coupling is @xmath67 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vem ] ) , and below , @xmath68 denotes the component of the gauge boson momentum @xmath69 transverse to the particle emitting this boson .",
    "note that in sudakov dl corrections there are no interference effects , so that we can talk about the emission ( and absorption ) of a gauge boson by a definite ( external ) particle , namely by a particle with momentum almost collinear to @xmath69 .",
    "it can be expressed in invariant form as @xmath70 for all @xmath71 .",
    "the above factorization is related to a non - abelian generalization of the gribov theorem ) below , together with a description of its essential content . ] for the amplitude of the bremsstrahlung of a photon with small transverse momentum @xmath72 in high energy hadron scattering @xcite .",
    "the form in which we present eq .",
    "( [ eq : vem ] ) corresponds to a covariant gauge for the gluon with momentum @xmath59 .",
    "formally this expression can be written in a gauge invariant way if we include in the sum the term with @xmath73 ( which does not give a dl contribution ) . indeed ,",
    "in this case we can substitute @xmath74 by @xmath75 , where the polarization matrices of the boson @xmath76 in the various gauges differ by the terms proportional to @xmath77 or @xmath78 giving a vanishing contribution due to the conservation of the total color charge @xmath79 .",
    "thus we have the possibility of choosing appropriate gauges for each kinematical region of quasi - collinearity of @xmath59 and @xmath80 .",
    "we can , however , use ( [ eq : vem ] ) as well , noting that in this region for @xmath81 we have @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the energy of the particle with momentum @xmath80 and @xmath84 the frequency of the emitted gauge boson , so that : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the eigenvalue of the casimir operator @xmath87 ( @xmath88 for gauge bosons in the adjoint representation of the gauge group @xmath49 and @xmath89 for fermions in the fundamental representation ) .",
    "the differential form of the infrared evolution equation follows immediately from ( [ eq : dgvem ] ) : @xmath90 where @xmath91 with @xmath92 as in the abelian case , @xmath93 is the probability to emit a soft and almost collinear gauge boson from the particle @xmath94 with mass @xmath95 , subject to the infrared cut - off @xmath9 on the transverse momentum .",
    "note again that the cut - off @xmath9 is not taken to zero .",
    "the function @xmath43 is determined by ( 9 ) for arbitrary values of the ratio @xmath96 . to logarithmic accuracy",
    ", we obtain from ( [ eq : wl ] ) : @xmath97 the infrared evolution equation ( [ eq : ee ] ) should be solved with an appropriate initial condition . in the case of large scattering angles , if we choose the cut - off to be the large scale @xmath98 then clearly there are no sudakov corrections .",
    "the initial condition is therefore @xmath99 and the solution of ( [ eq : ee ] ) is thus given by the product of the born amplitude and the sudakov form factors : @xmath100 therefore we obtain an exactly analogous sudakov exponentiation for the gauge group @xmath49 to that for the abelian case , see ( [ eq : a11 ] ) . theories with semi - simple gauge groups can be considered in a similar way .      since ultimately we are interested in measurable cross sections we have to consider the dl corrections to amplitudes of processes with soft emissions , as well as those without .",
    "only in inclusive cross sections will the dependence on the infrared cut - off @xmath101 disappear , being replaced by parameters specifying the experimental acceptance . to put it in another way",
    ", cross sections of the emission processes receive large ( dl ) contributions from regions where the emitted bosons are soft and the emission angles are small . therefore , to be consistent , we need to calculate cross sections of such processes as well .",
    "this is easy to do for qed processes , where the single gauge boson ( the photon ) is neutral and does not possess self - interactions . therefore soft photons are emitted independently according to a poisson distribution . in non - abelian theories ,",
    "gauge bosons are not neutral and interact with each other .",
    "consequently , the soft emission does not follow a poisson distribution @xcite .",
    "we again consider the simplest situation , when the additional soft gauge boson is emitted in the process with all invariants @xmath102 large .",
    "of course , for the emission of a boson almost collinear to the particle the direction of the particle with momentum @xmath103 , the invariant @xmath104 is small in comparison with @xmath98 . in the case of",
    "non - abelian gauge theories the corresponding amplitude for the emission of a soft gauge boson with small @xmath105 has , according to the gribov theorem , the following form : @xmath106 the possible corrections to this factorized expression are of the order of @xmath107 .",
    "however , to dl accuracy , we can substitute @xmath58 in the arguments of the scattering amplitudes by its boundary value @xmath57 .",
    "notice that the amplitude on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : rem ] )",
    "is taken on - the - mass shell , which guarantees its gauge invariance . the result ( [ eq : rem ] ) is highly non - trivial in the feynman diagram approach .",
    "it means , that the region of applicability of the classical formulas for the bremsstrahlung amplitudes is significantly enlarged at high energies .",
    "v.  gribov proved this result by using dispersion relations in the variables @xmath108 , and demonstrating that for small @xmath109 the pole terms in these invariants are much larger than the corresponding cut contributions due to the gauge invariance of the theory @xcite .",
    "the region of applicability of ( [ eq : rem ] ) corresponds to the situation when the momentum of the emitted soft boson does not spoil the kinematics of the non - radiative process .",
    "this implies that the frequency @xmath110 of the boson emitted off the particle with momentum @xmath80 should be much smaller than the energy @xmath83 , and that the emission angle latexmath:[$\\vartheta _ { l}\\simeq         the angle between @xmath80 and all other momenta @xmath112 ( otherwise one needs to include interference effects ) . for the physical coulomb gauge ( @xmath113 ) in the kinematical region where the gauge boson is emitted at a small angle @xmath114 with respect to the particle with momentum @xmath103 in ( [ eq : rem ] ) only the term with @xmath115 contributes .",
    "the method based on the infrared evolution equation allows us to calculate , in the dl approximation , the amplitudes of the hard processes accompanied by the emission of any number of soft gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "let us consider the amplitude for the emission of one soft gauge boson in the region of quasi - collinearity of its momentum with momentum @xmath103 ( i.e. , the emission of a soft boson by a particle with momentum @xmath103 ) .",
    "when the transverse momentum @xmath109 of this boson is much less than the infrared cut - off @xmath9 , used for the virtual particles , the amplitude is given by the term with @xmath115 in the sum in ( [ eq : rem ] ) .",
    "but we need to know the emission amplitude in the opposite case , @xmath116 .",
    "it can be found from the evolution equation in this region using expression ( [ eq : rem ] ) at @xmath117 as the initial condition .",
    "the kernel of the evolution equation in this region differs from the corresponding kernel in the region @xmath118 ( that is the kernel ( 16 ) of the evolution equation for the amplitude without emission ) by a term connected with the emission of a virtual boson from the real gauge boson with momentum @xmath59 : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is given by ( [ eq : wl ] ) with @xmath88 and @xmath121 , see fig .",
    "it is clear , that this new term in the kernel for evolution from @xmath122 to @xmath58 leads to an additional term @xmath123 in the sudakov exponential .",
    "thus , the amplitude for the emission of one gauge boson with small transverse momentum from the hard scattering process is of the form : @xmath124 @xmath125 we note again that here @xmath122 means the square of the component of the three - dimensional momentum transverse to the momentum of the emitting particle , say for example , @xmath80 .",
    "we can write @xmath122 in the invariant form @xmath126 with @xmath81 , which does not depend on @xmath13 .",
    "again we see that we have the exponentiation of the sudakov dl corrections .",
    "note that in the abelian qed case we have @xmath127 and the exponent for the photon bremsstrahlung amplitude remains the same as that for the process without photon emission .",
    "it is related to the poisson distribution for soft photon production .",
    "the exponentiation of virtual dl corrections holds for multiple emission processes as well . in qed",
    "it is trivial , since the soft photons are emitted independently . in non - abelian gauge theories it is not so simple .",
    "the main complexity is connected with the nontrivial structure of the amplitudes for multiple emission of real soft gauge bosons , arising from their self - interaction .",
    "but in the dl approximation these amplitudes can be calculated .",
    "due to the coherence effect , the branching cascade develops only in the region of sequentially shrinking angular cones @xcite . in this region",
    "the born amplitudes for multiple emission processes have a factorized form and the virtual corrections exponentiate @xcite .",
    "it is proved by solving the infrared evolution equation in a series of regions where the infrared cut - off @xmath9 is bounded between a sequence of decreasing transverse momenta of the emitted gluons , using in each region the solution of the previous region as the initial condition .",
    "the final result is    @xmath128 @xmath129 where @xmath130 are the momenta of the emitted gluons with strongly ordered energies and @xmath131 are their components transverse to the momenta of the emitting jets .",
    "the same method , based on the infrared evolution equation , is also applicable to broken gauge theories .",
    "let us consider for definiteness the standard electroweak theory , where the physical gauge bosons are a massless photon ( described by the field @xmath132 ) and massive @xmath133 and @xmath134 bosons ( described correspondingly by fields @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) .",
    "to dl accuracy , all masses can be set equal : @xmath137 and the energy considered to be much larger , @xmath138 . in the unbroken phase the corresponding abelian and yang - mills fields",
    "are denoted by @xmath139 and @xmath140 , with @xmath141 .",

    "approximation the value of the infrared cutoff @xmath12 can be chosen in two different ranges : 1 ) @xmath148 and 2 ) @xmath149 .",
    "the second case is universal in the sense that it does not depend on details of the electroweak theory .",
    "it will be discussed below . in the first region",
    "we can neglect spontaneous symmetry breaking effects , in particular gauge boson masses , and consider the evolution equation in the unbroken phase with effectively massless particles @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "of course one could calculate everything also in terms of the physical fields @xmath152 and @xmath153 . in the unbroken phase this is equivalent to the description in terms of the original fields @xmath154 and @xmath155 and leads to the same final result , but the intermediate steps will be more complicated because there are cancellations between non - exponentiating terms from diagrams with @xmath134 and @xmath156 exchanges .",
    "the separation of these contributions is not gauge invariant and if we would consider the diagrams without virtual photons we would violate @xmath157 symmetry .",
    "taking into account only such diagrams leads to nonexponentiating dl effects in an axial gauge @xcite .",
    "3 illustrates this at the two loop level .",
    "the loss of gauge invariance is related to the fact that the photon field contains the component @xmath158 of the non - abelian field @xmath159 , and so omitting the virtual photons would violate the conservation of the weak isospin current ( in the unbroken theory ) .",

    "correspond to the contributions of the soft photon ( interacting with the electric charge @xmath170 ) , the @xmath133 and the @xmath134 bosons , respectively .",
    "although we may rewrite solution ( [ eq : ubs ] ) in terms of the parameters of the broken theory in the form of a product of three exponents corresponding to the exchanges of photons , @xmath133 and @xmath134 bosons , it would be wrong to identify the contributions of the diagrams without virtual photons with this expression for the particular case @xmath171 .",
    "this becomes evident when we note that if we were to omit photon lines then the result would depend on the choice of gauge , and therefore be unphysical . only for @xmath172 , where the photon coincides with the @xmath150 gauge boson ,",
    "would the identification of the @xmath173 term with the contribution of the diagrams with photons be correct .",

    "consequently , for values of the infrared cut - off @xmath202 we obtain : @xmath206 where @xmath193 is given by ( [ eq : ubsa ] ) and @xmath207 the important point here is the difference of the dl exponent for a nonradiative process and the process with photon emission , which leads to a violation of the poisson distribution for photons in the dl approximation at high energies .",
    "it is a direct consequence of the fact that the photon has a non - abelian component .",
    "measurable cross sections have an inclusive nature ( at least with respect to photons , since only cross sections with an infinite number of emitted soft photons are observable ) .",
    "let us consider the dl corrections to such cross sections .",
    "it is clear that for the emission of real gauge bosons the same cut - off @xmath208 must be used as for virtual ones .",
    "therefore , to calculate an experimentally measured cross section we have to take the cut - off @xmath58 less than the lower bound @xmath209 of @xmath210 of those photons emitted in processes which are not included in the cross section .",
    "the calculation of the cross section is simple if the experimental conditions are such that only processes with emission of photons with @xmath211 are allowed . in this case",
    "the non - abelian component of the photon is not essential , so that photon emissions obey a poisson distribution .",
    "therefore for the cross section with an arbitrary number of emitted photons with momenta lying inside regions @xmath212 of the momentum space around the emitting particles with momenta @xmath103 , we obtain : @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the cross section of the non - radiative process and @xmath215 is the probability of the emission of photons with @xmath216 inside the allowed region @xmath217 since the upper bound on @xmath57 of the photons which are allowed to be radiated is less than @xmath218 , we must use the cut - off @xmath219 and , consequently , ( [ eq : ubsa ] ) for the matrix element of the non - radiative process .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath220   \\nonumber \\\\       & & \\times \\exp \\left [ -\\sum_{i=1}^{n}q_{i}^{2}\\left ( w_{i}(s,\\mu       ^{2})-w_{i}(s , m^{2})\\right ) + w_{\\exp}^{\\gamma } \\right ] \\ , ,       \\label{eq : h3 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath221 is given by ( 10 ) and ( 9 ) . evidently , the dependence on @xmath9 in @xmath222 and @xmath215 cancels in the exponential .",
    "if we include in the observed cross section the emission of gauge bosons with transverse momenta larger than @xmath223 , then the problem becomes much more complicated because of the non - poisson distribution of soft emission in non - abelian gauge theories @xcite .",
    "let us consider here the simplest example of the cross section completely inclusive of photons emission in the two - loop approximation .",
    "then the cross section can be written as @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the one - loop virtual correction , @xmath226 comes from one - photon emission taken in the born approximation and @xmath227 from the one - loop correction to one - photon emission .",
    "due to exponentiation of the dl terms of the sudakov - type in virtual corrections , the term @xmath228 in ( [ eq : h4 ] ) gives the two - loop virtual correction .",
    "the term @xmath229 gives the correction from two - photon emission in the born approximation , since in this approximation the two photons are emitted independently .    in the considered case of the cross section completely inclusive of photon emission",
    "the cut - off parameter @xmath58 can be taken as large as @xmath218 ( but not greater , because the cross section does not include @xmath133 and @xmath134 emission ) .",
    "each of the corrections considered above depends on @xmath230 , but their sum in ( [ eq : h4 ] ) does not ; therefore , we can take the most suitable value of the cut - off to calculate the cross section .",
    "it is easy to see that the most convenient choice is @xmath231 . in this case from ( 26 ) we have : @xmath232 the correction due to one - photon emission taken in the born approximation is @xmath233 where @xmath234 is given by ( [ eq : h2 ] ) with @xmath231 , @xmath235 and the region @xmath212 defined by inequality @xmath236 .",
    "it gives @xmath237 the one - loop contribution to this correction @xmath227 can be found with help of ( 26 ) , ( 31 ) , ( 32 ) and ( 33 ) : @xmath238\\ ] ] @xmath239 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : h7}\\ ] ]",
    "the important point here is that the virtual correction to the one - photon emission does not coincide with the corresponding correction to the non - radiative process ( which means violation of the poisson distribution ) and depends on the momentum of the emitted photon .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that the photon has a non - abelian component .",
    "one can check that using an arbitrary cut - off @xmath219 gives the same result , but the calculation is more complicated .",
    "for two particle scattering in either the forward @xmath240 or the backward @xmath241 directions , corresponding to the regge regime , there are situations , where the amplitudes have dl contributions different from those of the sudakov type .",
    "these logarithms appear from feynman diagrams in which the soft particles with the minimal transverse momenta are pairs of virtual fermions or bosons exchanged in the crossed @xmath242 or @xmath28 channels . for qed and qcd the infrared evolution equations for such regge processes",
    "are known [ 4 , 5 , 7 ] .",
    "the new features presented by the standard model of weak interactions are that the gauge group is semi - simple , @xmath243 , and that there is a large difference in the particle mass scales .",
    "the general strategy of finding dl asymptotics in this case is to first solve the evolution equation in the region @xmath244 , where @xmath245 is the largest particle mass in the theory ; then to solve it in the region @xmath246 , where @xmath247 is the next largest particle mass , using the solution of the previous equation at @xmath248 as the initial condition , and to proceed with these steps until the intermediate particles are light quarks , electrons , neutrinos and photons .    for simplicity",
    "we consider only the evolution equation in the region where the cut - off parameter @xmath9 is much larger than all particle masses . in this case",
    "it is natural to calculate the amplitudes in terms of the massless particles of the unbroken theory , that is the leptons and quarks , the higgs , @xmath150 and @xmath198 bosons . by",
    "solving the generalized infrared evolution equation in the dl approximation we sum up contributions of ladder - type diagrams in the crossed channel , with all possible insertions of the gauge bosons , leading to the sudakov double logarithms .",
    "because the transverse momenta of the virtual particles are strongly ordered , the integral kernels in the ladder diagrams are given by the splitting kernels of the dglap evolution equ ation @xcite which describes all possible transitions among fermions and bosons in the standard model .",
    "these splitting kernels can be simplified since the regge kinematic domain corresponds to a strong ordering of the bjorken variables @xmath249 along the ladder .",
    "for definiteness we study the simple case of the backward lepton ( @xmath94 ) - antilepton ( @xmath250 ) scattering for @xmath251 . in the born approximation , the contribution of the feynman diagrams with the higgs , photon , @xmath150 and @xmath198 boson exchanges depend on the helicities @xmath252 ( with @xmath253 ) of the initial and final fermions , which have momenta @xmath254 we consider the scattering of the leptons @xmath255 and @xmath256 belonging to the first generation with the smallest masses .",
    "because the coupling of the higgs particle to leptons is proportional to their mass , we can neglect the higgs contribution .",
    "the dirac spinors describing the @xmath94 and @xmath257 states with the definite helicities @xmath52 are @xmath258 where @xmath259 with the use of these expressions we can calculate the matrix elements of the @xmath260-matrix structures which appear in the born approximation for backward lepton - antilepton scattering , @xmath261 , @xmath262 it is important , to note that both the helicity structures of @xmath263 and @xmath264 are proportional to @xmath265 , which means , that the helicities of the two fermions in the crossed @xmath28 channel are opposite in sign .",
    "therefore the born diagram with a virtual @xmath198 boson gives a negligible contribution to the backward scattering . because the @xmath150 boson interacts with hypercharge @xmath145 ,",
    "its contribution to the born amplitude is also zero for the right - handed neutrinos ( if they were to exist ) .",
    "below we consider only the non - trivial case , when only @xmath266 , @xmath267 and @xmath268 can participate in the reaction .",
    "because the hypercharge @xmath269 for left - handed fermions and @xmath270 for the right - handed electron , in this case the born amplitude is given by @xmath271 in the dl approximation we also obtain a significant simplification of the helicity structure of the scattering amplitude : @xmath272 where the functions @xmath273 describe contributions with positive and negative signature : @xmath274 the amplitudes @xmath275 are assumed to satisfy dispersion relations of the form @xmath276 where in the born approximation @xmath277 is different from zero only in the region where @xmath278 is of the order of unity . in particular , from the known behavior of the born contribution @xmath279 at large @xmath98 and its degeneracy in the signature we obtain @xmath280 the absence of degeneracy of the amplitude with respect to signature is a result of the presence of the non - planar diagrams which arise from the virtual soft @xmath150-bosons in the infrared evolution equations ( cf . the qcd case @xcite ) : @xmath281 @xmath282 @xmath283 @xmath284 where we introduced the notation    @xmath285    the linear terms in @xmath275 , on the right - hand side of the evolution equations , are the sudakov contributions which arise from soft @xmath198 and @xmath286 virtual bosons coupling to external lines with different momenta @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "the non - linear terms appear due to soft pairs of leptons exchanged in the crossed @xmath28 channel .",
    "note that , in the above equations , the term related to the @xmath98-channel sudakov vertex with @xmath198 exchange is proportional to the casimir operator @xmath289 for the weak isospin group @xmath165 , and the total @xmath150 boson contribution from the four sudakov vertices having singularities in the @xmath98 and @xmath242 channels is proportional to @xmath290 .",
    "the corresponding contribution of these vertices to the terms mixing the amplitudes with different signatures is proportional to @xmath291 for @xmath198 exchange and @xmath292 for @xmath150 exchange .",
    "non - linear terms take into account the contribution of the ladder diagrams for two leptons interacting through @xmath150 exchanges .",
    "the above equations can be simplified if we use the mellin representation for the amplitudes : @xmath293 where @xmath294 are the signature factors @xmath295 and where the integration contour @xmath296 is situated along the imaginary axes to the right of all singularities of the @xmath242-channel partial waves @xmath297 . in the @xmath13-representation , taking into account the degeneracy of the partial waves with different signatures in the born approximation , the evolution equations can be written in the form of ricatti equations [ 7 ] : @xmath298 if we take into account only the terms with effective dl variables @xmath299 and neglect other terms .",
    "furthermore , using the following definition for the @xmath242-channel partial waves @xmath300 the equations can be written as follows @xmath301 both equations can be reduced to linear form after introducing new functions @xmath302 and @xmath303 according to the definitions @xmath304 they have the form of schrdinger equations @xmath305 the first is an equation for the harmonic oscillator . therefore taking into account the boundary condition",
    "@xmath306 so as to match onto perturbation theory , we obtain the solution @xmath307 where @xmath308 is the parabolic cylinder function : @xmath309 therefore for the scattering amplitude with positive signature we have , to dl accuracy , @xmath310 with @xmath311 .",
    "the equation for negative signatures can be easily solved for @xmath312 ( corresponding to complex values of the weinberg angle ) : @xmath313 where @xmath314 is the confluent hypergeometric function : @xmath315 therefore for @xmath312 , the amplitude with negative signature , in the dl approximation , is @xmath316 with @xmath311 . for general values of the parameter @xmath317 the solution can be obtained as a perturbation series in @xmath318 .",
    "this perturbative expansion is convergent for all values of the dl parameter @xmath319 .",
    "because the function @xmath308 does not have any singularities in the complex plane , the high energy asymptotics of the scattering amplitude with positive signature @xmath320 is determined by the position of its zeroes , @xmath321 , in the left - half plane , re@xmath322 .",
    "the function @xmath323 has a singularity @xmath324 as @xmath325 , and therefore the scattering amplitude with negative signature behaves as @xmath326 at high energies .",
    "such behavior of @xmath327 is valid also for other values of the parameter @xmath317 .",
    "note , that similar dl asymptotics were obtained in qed for @xmath1 backward scattering amplitudes . for energies smaller than the masses of @xmath198 and @xmath134 bosons , only diagrams with virtual photons give rise to a dl contribution .",
    "the photons interact with electric charge @xmath328 , which is the same for left- and right - handed electrons .",
    "it is interesting , that at very large energies , the behavior of @xmath1 backward scattering amplitudes is different from the qed prediction even in the case of the abelian standard model with @xmath329    the dl asymptotics of lepton - antilepton forward scattering amplitudes , which is related to @xmath242-channel exchange of two fermions and an arbitrary number of @xmath198 and @xmath150 bosons , can be obtained in a similar way . in this case",
    "one should take into account the diagram with a virtual @xmath198 boson even in the born approximation .",
    "the reggeization of the fermions and @xmath198 boson can also be verified in the dl approximation with the use of the infrared evolution equation .",
    "moreover , one can construct amplitudes with quasi - elastic unitarity @xcite , which is important for the theory of the bfkl pomeron @xcite .",
    "some other applications of the dl asymptotics in qcd are given in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the double logarithmic ( dl ) corrections to the amplitudes of a number of different high energy processes , in particular , of electroweak processes in the standard model .",
    "these sudakov - type corrections , which are found to exponentiate , are crucial for the high precision studies planned at the next linear @xmath330 collider .",
    "our approach is based on the use of an evolution equation in the infrared cut - off parameter @xmath9 , which in turn is based on a generalization of a gauge invariant dispersive method for photon bremsstrahlung originally due to gribov .",
    "we have assumed that the energy of the process is much larger than all the masses in the theory .",
    "however new physics could appear in the tev region and it will modify our dl asymptotic forms . because our approach is based on the infrared evolution equation ,",
    "we need simply to change the initial conditions in this region to incorporate the new particles and/or new interactions of the existing particles .",
    "the infrared evolution equation has the form of a renormalization group equation in the two - dimensional impact parameter subspace .",
    "the usual bfkl equation can be also considered as a simplified version of the renormalization group equation but in two - dimensional longitudinal subspace . in this case , in the leading logarithmic approximation @xmath331 , instead of their dependence from the infrared cut - off @xmath12 , we have conformal invariance of the @xmath242-channel partial waves in impact parameter space .",
    "however , in the next - to - leading approximation , the effect of the running coupling leads to violation of conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "after the breaking of conformal invariance the equation takes the form of a quantized callan - symanzik equation @xcite .",
    "therefore , even in the case of the bfkl equation , the renormalization group has its peculiarities .",
    "it is related to the fact , that the equation determines not only the anomalous dimensions of the operators of different twists , but also their relative contributions .",
    "the expressions for the dl asymptotics that we have obtained in the standard model can be used in perturbation theory to verify the first order , and to predict the higher order , expressions for scattering amplitudes , as has been done for the dl asymptotics in qcd @xcite , @xcite .",
    "finally , we reiterate that the accurate calculation of scattering amplitudes is important because the effects of new physics can be rather small .",
    "after this work was completed a paper by p. ciafaloni and d. comelli @xcite appeared , in which the electroweak dl corrections are considered in the particular case of massless @xmath332 production by a source which is a singlet with respect to the @xmath243 gauge group .",
    "the results of this paper ( in particular , nonexponentiating dl corrections ) are not in agreement with our corresponding results .",
    "the difference appears due to the fact that the method in @xcite consists of factorizing off the virtual gauge boson with the softest ( i.e. with smallest frequency ) momentum @xmath333 by computing external line insertions only , and in iterating this procedure by setting the virtual momentum @xmath334 in the left - over diagram .",
    "we believe that this approach , which is in disagreement with the method based on the infrared evolution equation , is not valid .",
