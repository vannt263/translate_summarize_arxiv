    "one of the most important questions in condensed matter physics relates to how we should characterize and classify the many different quantum phases of matter .",
    "a large part of the story is the theory of symmetry breaking , which tells us that we should classify various phases based on the symmetries of the ground state wave function . yet with the discovery of the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states@xcite came also the understanding that there are many distinct and fascinating quantum phases of matter , called topological phases , whose characterization has nothing at all to do with symmetry .",
    "how should we characterize and systematically classify the different possible topological phases that may occur in a fqh system ?",
    "let us run through a few obvious possibilities .",
    "we know that the fqh states contain topology - dependent and topologically stable degenerate ground states , which allow us to introduce the concept of topological order in fqh states.@xcite such topology - dependent degenerate ground states suggest that the low energy theories describing the fqh states are topological gauge field theories in 2 + 1 dimensions , called chern - simons theories.@xcite so one possibility is that we may try to classify the different fqh phases by classifying all of the different possible chern - simons theories .",
    "but this is not a satisfactory approach for non - abelian fqh states because we do not have a good way of knowing which chern - simons theories can possibly correspond to a physical system made of electrons and which can not .",
    "another possibility comes through the connection between fqh wavefunctions and conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "it was discovered around 1990 that correlation functions in certain two - dimensional conformal field theories may serve as good model wavefunctions for fqh states.@xcite thus perhaps we may classify fqh states by classifying all of the different conformal field theories that may be used to construct a `` valid '' fqh wavefunction . while the connection between fqh wave functions and cft correlators has been extremely fruitful in both constructing new model wavefunctions and understanding their topological properties , the cft approach is incomplete in that there does not exist a complete classification of all possible conformal field theories that may be used to construct fqh wavefunctions .",
    "this precludes the possibility of systematically classifying fqh states .",
    "the cft approach also obscures the essential physics and the essential properties of the conformal field theory that allow one to obtain amenable fqh wavefunctions .    in an attempt to obtain a systematic classification of fqh states ,",
    "it was shown recently that a wide class of single - component fqh states and their topological excitations can be classified by their pattern of zeros , which describe the way ideal fqh wavefunctions go to zero when various clusters of particles are brought together.@xcite this analysis led to the discovery of some new non - abelian fqh states whose corresponding cft has not yet been identified .",
    "it also helped elucidate the role of cft in constructing fqh wavefunctions .",
    "the cft encodes the way the wavefunction goes to zero as various clusters of electrons are brought together .",
    "the order of these zeros must satisfy certain conditions and the solutions to these conditions correspond to particular cfts .",
    "thus in classifying and characterizing fqh states , one can bypass the cft altogether and proceed directly to classifying the different allowed pattern of zeros and subsequently obtaining the topological properties of the quasiparticles from the pattern of zeros .",
    "this construction can then even be thought of as a classification of the allowed cfts that can be used to construct fqh states .",
    "furthermore , these considerations give way to a natural notion of which pattern of zeros solutions are simpler than other ones . in this sense , then , one can see that the moore - read pfaffian quantum hall state@xcite is the `` simplest '' non - abelian generalization of the laughlin state .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the pattern - of - zeros classification to multilayer fqh wave functions .",
    "such a systematic classification leads us to the construction of non - abelian multilayer fqh states and also helps identify the simplest non - abelian generalizations of the halperin@xcite bilayer fqh states .",
    "therefore , in the same way that the pfaffian fqh state is the simplest non - abelian single - layer state and so one of the first non - abelian states expected to be realized experimentally , our construction allows us to identify the simplest non - abelian bilayer states and therefore some of the ones that deserve further consideration in future experimental and numerical work .",
    "we would like to point out that the `` 1d charge - density - wave '' characterization of single - component fqh states@xcite is closely related to the pattern - of - zeros approach .",
    "our pattern - of - zeros approach for multilayer fqh states can also be viewed as a way to generalize the `` 1d charge - density - wave '' characterization to multicomponent cases.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by describing the ideal fqh wave functions that we can characterize by the pattern of zeros and their relation to symmetric holomorphic polynomials . in section [ pozcharacterization ]",
    ", we describe the different ways to characterize the pattern of zeros . in section",
    "[ conditions ] we find the conditions that the pattern of zeros must satisfy in order to describe valid fqh wave functions . in section [ idealhamiltonians ] ,",
    "we sketch how one may begin to construct ideal hamiltonians whose ground states will be fqh wave functions with a given pattern of zeros . after a brief summary of the pattern of zeros data and conditions in section [ summary ]",
    ", we explain in section [ cftsection ] the relation between the pattern - of - zeros approach and the cft approach to fqh wave functions . in section [ examples ] , we describe some example solutions of this systematic classification of multilayer fqh wave functions , which yields many non - abelian multilayer states . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss some of the simplest of these non - abelian bilayer states that may be relevant for experiments on two - component quantum hall systems and that warrant further numerical study .",
    "the ground state wave function of a two - dimensional system of electrons in the lowest landau level can be written in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the coordinates of the @xmath7 electron , and @xmath8 is a holomorphic function of @xmath9 .",
    "since the electrons obey fermi statistics , @xmath10 is anti - symmetric under interchange of any two coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath11 when all of the electrons are identical . in many physical situations ,",
    "the electrons may be distinguished by various quantum numbers , such as a spin index ( when the zeeman energy is not too high ) , a layer index ( in a multilayer two - dimensional electron system ) , a valley index ( such as in graphene and sige heterostructures ) , _ etc . in such cases ,",
    "the ground state wave function in the lowest landau level may instead be written in the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a flavor index and @xmath14 is the number of different flavors .",
    "@xmath10 is then necessarily antisymmetric only under interchange of @xmath15 and @xmath16 for any @xmath17 and @xmath18 . given any antisymmetric polynomial @xmath19 , we can uniquely construct a symmetric polynomial : @xmath20 @xmath21 will also be a polynomial because @xmath22 must vanish when any two identical particles approach each other .",
    "thus the above division by the factor @xmath23 will never produce any poles in the resulting function .",
    "_    therefore to classify fqh phases of electrons , we can restrict our attention mainly to symmetric polynomials @xmath24 , where @xmath10 is invariant under the interchange of @xmath15 and @xmath16 for any @xmath17 and @xmath18 , but not necessarily invariant under the interchange of @xmath15 and @xmath25 if @xmath26 . in this paper",
    "we will often refer to @xmath27 as a layer index . in the following",
    ", @xmath10 will always refer to such a symmetric multilayer polynomial .",
    "we will introduce data , such as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , to characterize and classify bosonic fqh states ( symmetric polynomials ) @xmath24 . from the above discussion",
    ", we see that the same set of data also characterizes fermionic fqh states whose wave functions are given by @xmath31 .",
    "progress in understanding the various possible topological phases in the fqh effect has occurred largely because of the discovery of various kinds of model wave functions and the ideal hamiltonians that yield these wavefunctions as their ground states . in the pattern of zeros",
    "approach , we classify all of the possible ideal wave functions for fqh phases . in this section",
    "we will explain what we mean by `` ideal . ''    for each topological phase in the fqh system",
    ", we want to have a certain representative wave function that captures the topological properties of the phase .",
    "the prototypical example of such an ideal wavefunction is the laughlin wave function at filling fraction @xmath32 : @xmath33 at every particle in @xmath34 , there are @xmath29 zeros , and there are no off - particle zeros .",
    "the exact ground state of the microscopic hamiltonian with the coloumb interaction does not have this simple property .",
    "nevertheless , the ideal laughlin wavefunction captures all of the essential topological properties of these phases .",
    "the laughlin wavefunctions are also ground states of certain ideal hamiltonians that contain interaction potentials that are constructed only from @xmath35-functions and their derivatives .",
    "for example , if the interaction potential is of the form @xmath36 then the following wavefunction is an exact ground state , with vanishing total potential energy : @xmath37 on the other hand , if the interaction potential between two electrons is of the form @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ,",
    "then the zero - energy ground state will be @xmath41    more complicated ground states can be obtained through more complicated interactions .",
    "for example , consider the following three - body interaction between electrons : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total symmetrization operator between @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "an exact zero - energy ground state of this interaction is the pfaffian wavefunction at @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the total antisymmetrization operator between @xmath50 .",
    "since the pfaffian and laughlin wavefunctions are exact zero - energy ground states of interaction potentials that are constructed only from @xmath35-functions and their derivatives , these wavefunctions can be characterized completely by their pattern of zeros , i.e. by the order of the zeros in the wavefunction as different numbers of particles are taken together .",
    "these wave functions have certain ideal properties ; for example , the zeros that are bound to a particle lie precisely at the location of that particle , not slightly away from it . in this paper , we will classify ideal fqh wavefunctions , which are wave functions that are exact zero energy ground states of such ideal hamiltonians .",
    "the existence of these ideal hamiltonians is crucial .",
    "we can write down any arbitrary complex function of @xmath51 variables , but we can not know whether it corresponds to a valid topological phase of matter in the limit @xmath52 unless we also know that it is the ground state of some local , gapped hamiltonian .",
    "if this is the case , then it is conceivable that there exists some physical situation in which the low energy effective interactions between electrons yields a phase of matter that is in the same universality class as the ideal wave functions that we constructed .",
    "unfortunately , judging whether a many - particle interacting hamiltonian is gapped in the thermodynamic limit is in general an intractable problem .",
    "so here we limit ourselves to classifying ideal wave functions , which at least we believe can be realized as ground states of local hamiltonians .",
    "whether the corresponding hamiltonian can be gapped in the thermodynamic limit is a question that we must attempt to answer along the way .",
    "the ideal quasihole wavefunctions for these states are also zero energy eigenstates of their corresponding ideal hamiltonians .",
    "the true ground state is distinguished by being the unique translationally invariant state with lowest angular momentum .",
    "thus we can also classify topologically distinct quasiholes by their pattern of zeros , i.e. by the order of the zeros in the quasihole wavefunction as different numbers of electrons are taken to the quasihole . while the quasihole wavefunctions are also zero energy states , the quasiparticles will be gapped and will have the same topological properties as the quasiholes .",
    "therefore in the following , when we discuss the pattern of zeros of the quasiparticles , we are referring to the pattern of zeros of the quasihole wave functions .",
    "not all fqh phases have such ideal wave functions .",
    "the hierarchy states and the composite fermion states , for example , do not have ideal wave functions . while these phases do have their own model wave functions , they are not ideal in the sense that they can not be directly described by their pattern of zeros or written as a correlation function of conformal primary operators in a cft",
    ". therefore the pattern - of - zeros construction does not directly classify these phases .",
    "we will however discuss how they are related to the ideal multilayer fqh wave functions in section [ sec : n11 ] .",
    "the spirit of the pattern - of - zeros approach is to consider bringing together @xmath53 particles of type @xmath27 , for @xmath13 , and asking how @xmath10 goes to zero under such a procedure .",
    "the order of the zero will be denoted @xmath30 , where @xmath54 . in the following",
    "we will more precisely define @xmath30 and discuss some different yet equivalent ways of characterizing the pattern of zeros .",
    "this discussion is a straightforward generalization of the discussion in the single - layer case.@xcite      consider a set of @xmath53 coordinates of each type @xmath27 , and set @xmath55 .",
    "define @xmath30 as the minimal power of @xmath56 in the polynomial @xmath10 .",
    "this means that if we set @xmath57 and we take @xmath58 , then @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a polynomial in @xmath61 and the remaining coordinates @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we refer to @xmath62 as the coordinate of an @xmath64-cluster .",
    "we assume that @xmath30 is independent of the choice of @xmath62 , which must be the case for translationally invariant wavefunctions .",
    "we also assume that @xmath30 is independent of the choice of @xmath65 and that different polynomials @xmath66 obtained from different choices of @xmath67 are linearly dependent .",
    "this is the assumption of _ unique fusion .",
    "_    we can immediately deduce some basic properties of @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath10 has no poles , it is clear that @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath10 must be single - valued under rotating @xmath69 in the complex plane by an angle @xmath70 , @xmath30 must be an integer .",
    "let @xmath71 be the minimal power of @xmath72 ; that is , @xmath73 .",
    "a translationally invariant @xmath10 will have @xmath74 , otherwise it will vanish everywhere .",
    "thus , for a translationally invariant polynomial , @xmath30 is a nonnegative integer that characterizes the order of zero that results when the size of an @xmath64-cluster goes to zero .      in the previous section",
    ", we introduced the derived polynomials @xmath76 . as a consequence of the unique fusion condition , these polynomials are actually independent of @xmath77 .",
    "we may consider more general derived polynomials by bringing together other sets of coordinates in @xmath78 to obtain @xmath79 .",
    "then we may consider bringing together an @xmath64-cluster and a @xmath80-cluster : @xmath81 thus , @xmath82 characterizes the order of the zeros in the derived polynomials as a cluster of @xmath64 electrons are brought close to a cluster of @xmath83 electrons .",
    "the unique - fusion condition assumes that the derived polynomials obtained from different ways of fusion are always linearly dependent .",
    "the fact that @xmath10 is a single - valued , symmetric polynomial implies @xmath84    we can deduce a relation between @xmath82 and @xmath30 as follows . the order of the zero obtained by creating an @xmath85-cluster is @xmath86 .",
    "one way of creating such a cluster is by first creating an @xmath64-cluster , then creating a @xmath83-cluster , and finally bringing together the two clusters to create an @xmath87-cluster .",
    "the order of zero in this case will be @xmath88 . thus @xmath82 can be obtained from @xmath89 through the formula @xmath90 since @xmath91 , where recall @xmath92 is the unit vector in the @xmath27 direction , we also have @xmath93 from this recursion relation and from the fact that @xmath91",
    ", we may obtain @xmath30 from the sequence @xmath82 .",
    "therefore we may equivalently label the pattern - of - zeros data using @xmath89 or @xmath94 .",
    "the integer @xmath30 has the following meaning .",
    "a polynomial with @xmath53 particles of @xmath95 kind ( @xmath53 particles in the @xmath95 layer ) has a total order of @xmath30 . in other words",
    "the total angular momentum of the quantum hall droplet is @xmath30 if the droplet has @xmath96 particles in the @xmath95 layer .",
    "if we remove one particle from the @xmath95 layer , then the total angular momentum of the quantum hall droplet will be reduced to @xmath97 .",
    "thus we can interpret @xmath98 as the angular momentum of the highest occupied orbital in the @xmath95 layer for a quantum hall droplet with @xmath99 particles in the @xmath100 layer .",
    "the @xmath14-dimensional sequence of vectors @xmath101 will be called the sequence of highest occupied orbitals ( hoo ) .",
    "we see that @xmath102 makes sense only when @xmath103 .",
    "we will set @xmath104 when it does not make sense . from",
    ", we also see that there is one - to - one correspondence between the sequence @xmath30 and @xmath105 .",
    "thus we can also use @xmath106 to characterize the pattern of zeros in the wave function .",
    "a fqh wave function @xmath107 defined on a sphere forms a representation of @xmath108 . in such a case , @xmath109 represents the stereographic projection onto the plane of a point on the sphere .",
    "a single particle in the lowest landau level can fill any of the @xmath110 orbitals , so the representation of @xmath108 formed in this case is the one with angular momentum @xmath111 .",
    "the su(2 ) lie algebra is generated by @xmath112 in the multilayer case , then , the angular momentum of a particle of type @xmath27 will be @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the total number of flux quanta through the sphere seen by the particles in the @xmath95 layer . note that here we allow the numbers of flux quanta in different layers to be different .",
    "the total angular momentum of an @xmath64 cluster in the @xmath109 direction will be the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath115 the operator @xmath116 counts the total power of a polynomial .",
    "since the minimum total power of @xmath117 is @xmath30 , the minimum total angular momentum of an @xmath64-cluster is given by @xmath118 .",
    "this means that the @xmath64-cluster carries an angular momentum of @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we will use this relation later to construct ideal hamiltonians and to place conditions on the pattern of zeros for when they can correspond to rotationally invariant wave functions on the sphere .",
    "for the pattern of zeros to describe a valid fqh wavefunction , it must satisfy certain consistency conditions .",
    "we already encountered several such conditions above .",
    "for instance , we found that @xmath30 is a nonnegative integer , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 is even . in the following we find additional conditions that the pattern of zeros must satisfy .",
    "one of the most important conditions on the wave function is simply the condition that the wave function have no poles .",
    "this condition is remarkably restrictive on the allowed pattern - of - zeros sequences .",
    "consider a derived polynomial @xmath124 and fix all coordinates but @xmath62 , thus viewing it as a complex function @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath125 has zeros at isolated points , but no poles anywhere .",
    "some of the zeros are located at @xmath126 , @xmath127 , .",
    "those zeros are called on - particle zeros .",
    "the rest of the zeros are called off - particle zeros .",
    "if we imagine taking @xmath62 around @xmath126 without enclosing any off - particle zeros , then @xmath128 will pick up a phase @xmath129 . similarly ,",
    "if we take @xmath62 around @xmath127 without enclosing any off - particle zeros , then @xmath128 will pick up a phase @xmath130 .",
    "now consider taking @xmath131 .",
    "under such a process , some nearby off - particle zeros will also be taken to @xmath127 . therefore , if we take @xmath62 around a contour that encloses both @xmath126 and @xmath127 in the limit that @xmath132 , the complex function @xmath128 must change by a phase that is greater than or equal to @xmath133 .",
    "the phase can never be less than this amount because that would require the existence of off - particle poles that get taken to @xmath127 in order to diminish the strength of the on - particle zeros . by definition ,",
    "the phase change of @xmath128 under the above procedure is @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , the condition that the wavefunction have no poles leads directly to the following concavity condition on the integers @xmath82 : @xmath135 in cases where all of the zeros are located on the particles and there are no off - particle zeros , the above inequality is saturated .",
    "this occurs in the laughlin states @xmath136 , and their multilayer abelian generalizations , the halperin states @xmath137    in the following we will rewrite the concave condition as @xmath138 @xmath139      the cluster condition is a way to associate some kind of grading to the polynomials that is physically meaningful . let @xmath140 for @xmath13 be a set of vectors that generate an @xmath14-dimensional lattice , where @xmath14 is , as before , the number of flavors of particles ( or the number of layers ) .",
    "the cluster condition states that the concave condition is saturated , _",
    "i.e. @xmath141 if either @xmath64 , @xmath83 , or @xmath142 lie on the lattice generated by @xmath143",
    ". that is , if either @xmath64 , @xmath83 , or @xmath142 can be written as a linear combination with integer coefficients of the vectors @xmath144 .",
    "this means that a derived polynomial containing a @xmath145 cluster is non - zero unless @xmath146 coincides with the coordinates of another cluster ; viewed as a function of the single variable @xmath146 , it has no off - particle zeros .",
    "a consequence of this is that if all of the particles are fused to form @xmath147-clusters , then the resulting derived polynomial has the laughlin - halperin form ( see ( [ halperin ] ) ) and there are no off - particle zeros . _",
    "the single - layer read - rezayi @xmath148 parafermion wave functions satisfy an @xmath28-cluster condition and they are exact ground states of hamiltonians with @xmath149-body interactions . for a fixed filling fraction , as @xmath28 increases , the number of topologically distinct quasiparticles , the ground state degeneracy on higher genus surfaces and the complexity of interactions necessary to realize the state all increase .",
    "this suggests that the energy gap typically decreases with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "wave functions that do not obey a cluster condition can be thought of as having infinite @xmath28 and are not expected to correspond to gapped phases .",
    "this intuition also comes from the cft approach to fqh wave functions ; infinite @xmath28 corresponds to an irrational conformal field theory , which does not yield a finite number of quasiparticles and a finite ground state degeneracy on the torus . in the multilayer case",
    ", we may use the volume of the unit cell spanned by @xmath140 as one way to measure the complexity of a given fqh state .",
    "the cluster condition is extremely powerful and simplifying because it allows us to determine the entire pattern - of - zeros sequence from knowledge of a `` small '' number of them . to see how this works ,",
    "first observe using ( [ clustercond ] ) that @xmath150 where we have defined the matrix @xmath151 .",
    "so for any vector @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is an integer and @xmath154 , we have : @xmath155 the above equations imply @xmath156 where we have also defined the matrix @xmath157 .    in terms of the sequence @xmath158",
    ", this implies that for @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is an integer , @xmath159 therefore , all of the integers @xmath30 are specified by the points @xmath160 within the unit cell spanned by @xmath144 .    in terms of the hoo squence @xmath106",
    ", we have : @xmath161 finally , note that since @xmath162 is an even integer , we have : @xmath163      the density profiles of the single - particle states in the lowest landau level , @xmath164 , are in the shape of a ring , with a peak at a radius @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the magnetic length .",
    "such a wave function has an angular momentum @xmath29 .",
    "when many of these orbitals are filled by particles , the total wavefunction will describe a uniform , rotationally symmetric state that goes to zero at a radius @xmath167 , where @xmath168 refers to the filled orbital with maximum angular momentum .",
    "therefore , a given quantum hall wavefunction will describe a qh droplet of area @xmath169 , and @xmath168 is given by the maximum power of @xmath44 ( or @xmath9 for any other fixed @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath168 is also equal to the number of flux quanta , @xmath170 .",
    "an important constraint on the multilayer quantum hall wavefunctions is that they must describe systems in which each layer occupies the same area , up to small corrections .",
    "the requirement that each layer occupies exactly the same area amounts to the requirement that each layer has exactly the same number of flux quanta , @xmath171 .",
    "however , it is reasonable to include states in which different layers occupy equal areas only up to @xmath172 corrections , where @xmath173 is the number of electrons .",
    "such a requirement of approximately equal area layers is summarized in the following equation : @xmath174 we wish to see how this condition translates into a condition on the pattern of zeros .",
    "the conditions are slightly different depending on whether we ultimately want to characterize gapped fqh phases of fermions or bosons .",
    "if we are interested in fermionic phases , we require that @xmath175 be a valid fqh wave function of fermions , which does not require that @xmath176 be a valid fqh wave function of bosons . in what follows we",
    "will explicitly analyze the bosonic case , where we require @xmath177 to be a valid multilayer fqh wave function of bosons .",
    "@xmath114 is equal to the maximal power of @xmath72 ; for the boson wavefunction @xmath10 , this is given by @xmath178 where recall @xmath179 is the number of particles of type @xmath27 .",
    "using the cluster condition , we find @xmath180 where we have set @xmath181 .",
    "requiring ( [ equalareacond1 ] ) , we obtain the following condition on the pattern of zeros : @xmath182 this can be seen most easily by ignoring the @xmath172 terms in ( [ nphieqn1 ] ) , taking @xmath183 , and inverting the result to obtain @xmath184 , which must be nonnegative . from this analysis",
    ", we learn that if @xmath185 is not invertible , then the pattern of zeros can not fix the ratio of particles @xmath186 in the different layers .",
    "therefore the corresponding fqh state has a gapless mode corresponding to the relative density fluctuations between the different layers .    as a simple example of this analysis , consider the @xmath187 halperin bilayer state , which is known to have a gapless density mode and for which @xmath188 , which is not invertible . a macroscopic number of particles can freely go from one layer to the other without changing the area of the quantum hall droplets , signalling the existence of a gapless relative density mode",
    ".    inverting ( [ nphieqn1 ] ) yields @xmath189 from which we can read off the filling fraction in each layer : @xmath190 the total filling fraction is the sum of the filling fraction of each layer : @xmath191 .    for fermions , ( [ nphipoz ] )",
    "is modified to @xmath192 due to the extra factor @xmath193 in @xmath194 .",
    "note that @xmath195 still describes the pattern of zeros of the symmetric polynomial @xmath10 .",
    "the result for fermions is therefore @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the @xmath198 identity matrix .",
    "if @xmath199 is not invertible in the fermionic case , then there are gapless relative density modes , which is why the filling fraction in each layer becomes undefined .",

    "we want to put the quantum state on a sphere with @xmath200 flux quanta in the @xmath95 layer .",
    "we would like to know for which set of @xmath200 can the quantum hall state completely fill the sphere ? naively , one may expect @xmath200 and @xmath179 are related by the filling fraction in each layer @xmath201 .",
    "however the precise relation between the number of flux quanta and the number of electrons includes a shift , @xmath202 where @xmath43 is of order 1 in the large @xmath173 limit ( see eqn .",

    "the answer is that some of the corresponding cfts in the multilayer case will be closely related to the @xmath303 parafermion cfts that were constructed by gepner , where @xmath0 is a simple affine lie algebra at level @xmath304 and @xmath305 is the rank of the lie algebra @xmath306.@xcite the case @xmath307 is equivalent to the @xmath302 parafermion cfts of zamalodchikov and fateev .",

    "if we are considering quantum hall states with @xmath14 layers , then we would expect to see the appearance of these parafermion cfts with rank @xmath317 .",
    "therefore in the bilayer case , one class of states that we expect to see should be related to @xmath318 parafermion cfts where @xmath306 is a simple lie algebra of rank 2 .",

    "to list the solutions for those simplest cases , we may use some known cfts to construct the appropriate simple - current algebra that corresponds to the pattern - of - zeros solutions . using this known cft",
    ", we can then write the wavefunction explicitly . however , the wave function that we write down may not be unique in some cases ; there may be several independent polynomials that have the same pattern of zeros .",

    "so although the pattern - of - zeros construction does not directly classify those single - layer hierarchy states , their topological orders can still be described by the pattern - of - zeros approach .",
    "this choice of @xmath28 requires that the electron operators in the cft must take the form @xmath351 where @xmath352 and @xmath272 has scaling dimension that is integer or half - integer .",

    "there may also be some degree of tunability in the relative densities between the two components in addition to being able to probe fqh states with different numbers of filled landau levels . with this greatly increased amount of variability and tunability in the effective interactions between electrons in the unfilled landau levels , it is possible that a non - abelian state can be realized in a two - component quantum hall system .",
    "since the pattern of zeros provides a systematic classification and characterization of a wide variety of quantum hall states , it provides us with a general sense of how all of the non - abelian bilayer states are related and which ones are simpler than other ones .",
    "just as we know that the single - layer pfaffian quantum hall state is the simplest non - abelian generalization of the laughlin states , we can determine the simplest non - abelian generalization of the halperin bilayer states and therefore single out some of the possibilities that may be experimentally viable .    in",
    ", we have given an overview of some of the simplest non - abelian bilayer states that we find and that occur at filling fractions at which experiments on two - component fqh systems have already observed incompressible states . here we briefly summarize that discussion and supplement details of the calculations of various topological properties of the candidate states .",
    "experiments have so far observed fqh plateaus in two - component systems at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath425 , @xmath426 , @xmath427 , @xmath428 , etc .",
    "@xcite in some cases , these plateaus have been observed in both bilayer and spin - unpolarized single - layer systems , while in others , the plateau has only been observed in one of them .",
    "at all of these filling fractions , there exists also one ( or several ) candidate abelian phase(s ) ; in most cases , it is assumed that these plateaus are described by one of the abelian phases .",
    "however , the pattern - of - zeros construction also yields many simple non - abelian states at these filling fractions . in some situations",
    ", we expect the non - abelian states to be good candidate states .",
    "there are at least two dimensionless quantities that are important determining factors for which fqh state is realized .",
    "the first parameter is @xmath429 , where @xmath430 is the potential for interlayer repulsion and @xmath431 is the potential for intralayer repulsion .",
    "the second parameter is @xmath432 , where @xmath433 is the interlayer hopping amplitude . in the limit @xmath434 and @xmath435",
    ", the system will be a fqh state that consists of two independent single - layer fqh states in each layer . in the limit @xmath436 and @xmath434 ,",
    "a single - layer fqh state may be observed .",
    "but if we keep @xmath435 and increase @xmath437 from @xmath438 , then the fqh state formed by two independent single - layer fqh states in each layer must undergo a phase transition into either a compressible phase or a new incompressible state . in the latter case ,",
    "an abelian hierarchy state ( such as a bilayer composite fermion state ) may form , which would in most cases be a state described by a @xmath439 or more complicated @xmath344-matrix and would have four or more edge modes .",
    "the other possibility is that a non - abelian two - component state may form .",
    "the pattern - of - zeros construction yields non - abelian two - component wave functions that have zeros when particles from different layers approach each other , indicating that they can accomodate situations in which @xmath440 . additionally , these states generally have less than @xmath441 edge modes ; if we use the number of edge modes as a measure of the complexity of the state , then the non - abelian states are simpler and may therefore be realized experimentally .    at @xmath1 , experiments on wide single quantum wells have observed a phase transition from a bilayer to single - layer state while experiments on single - layer systems have seen a phase transition from a spin - polarized to a spin - unpolarized state . in the limit @xmath442 and @xmath435",
    ", the system should be in the @xmath443 state . as @xmath437 is increased while @xmath435 , one possibility is the @xmath444 state .",
    "this wave function appears unphysical , because it has higher order zeros as particles from different layers approach each other than particles from within the same layer .",
    "another wave function , which has the same topological order as @xmath444 , is a spin - singlet composite fermion state.@xcite there are two other plausible non - abelian states in this situation .",
    "one is the following interlayer pfaffian state ( see ( [ interpfpoz ] ) and ( [ interpfwf ] ) ): @xmath445 the other is the following intralayer pfaffian state @xmath446 which has even higher order zeros as particles from different layers approach each other .",
