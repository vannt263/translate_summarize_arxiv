    "entanglement is one of the potential sources of quantum theory .",
    "it is the key concept and major resource for quantum communication and computation @xcite . in the last few years",
    ", enormous efforts has been made to investigate various aspects of quantum entanglement and its benefits in a number of setups , such as teleportation of unknown states @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "recently , the study of quantum entanglement of various fields has been extended to the relativistic setup @xcite and interesting results about the behavior of entanglement have been obtained .",
    "the study of entanglement in the relativistic framework is important not only from quantum information perspective but also to understand deeply the black hole thermodynamics @xcite and the black hole information paradox @xcite .",
    "the earlier investigations on quantum entanglement in the relativistic framework is mainly focused by considering isolated quantum systems .",
    "in fact , no quantum system can be completely isolated from its environment and may results in a non - unitary dynamics of the system .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the effect of environment on the entanglement in an initial state of a quantum system during its evolution .",
    "the interaction between an environment and a quantum system leads to the phenomenon of decoherence and it gives rise to an irreversible transfer of information from the system to the environment @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     if we compare the single qubit and the both qubits decohering situations , it becomes obvious that the entanglement loss is rapid when both the qubits are coupled to the noisy environment .",
    "for example , in the case of bit flip channel the concurrence behaves as a linear function of @xmath0 for single qubit decohering case whereas in the case of both qubits decohering case it varies as a parabolic function .",
    "nevertheless , the sudden death happens at the same value of @xmath0 , irrespective of the acceleration , for both cases under the action of bit flip and phase damping channels . for depolarizing channel",
    ", however , this is not true .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated that the entanglement in dirac fields is strongly dependent on coupling with a noisy environment .",
    "this result is contrary to the case of an isolated system in which the entanglement of dirac fields survives even in the limit of infinite acceleration of rob s frame . in the presence of decoherence ,",
    "the entanglement rapidly decreases and entanglement sudden death occurs even for zero acceleration . under the action of phase flip channel , the entanglement can regrow when both qubits are coupled to a noisy environment in the limit of large values of decoherence parameter .",
    "the entanglement disappears , irrespective of the acceleration , under the action of phase damping channel only when the channel is fully decohered both for single qubit and the two qubits decohering cases .",
    "however , under the action of depolarizing channel an early sudden death occurs for larger acceleration when both qubits are coupled to the environment . in summary ,",
    "the entanglement generated by unruh effect in noninertial frame is strongly influenced by decoherence ."
