    "the experiments on resistivity of high mobility two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in presence of a relatively weak magnetic field and microwave radiation led to a discovery of striking zero - resistance states ( zrs ) induced by a microwave field by mani _",
    "_ @xcite and zudov _ et al .",
    "other experimental groups also found the microwave induced zrs in various 2deg samples ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a similar behavior of resistivity is also observed for electrons on a surface of liquid helium in presence of magnetic and microwave fields @xcite .",
    "these experimental results obtained with different systems stress the generic nature of zrs .",
    "various theoretical explications for this striking phenomenon have been proposed during the decade after the first experiments @xcite .",
    "an overview of experimental and theoretical results is give in the recent review @xcite .",
    "in our opinion the most intriguing feature of zrs is their almost periodic structure as a function of the ratio @xmath0 between the microwave frequency @xmath1 and cyclotron frequency @xmath2 .",
    "( in the following we are using units with electron charge @xmath3 and mass @xmath4 equal to unity ) . indeed , a hamiltonian of electron in a magnetic field is equivalent to an oscillator , it has a magneto - plasmon resonance at @xmath5 but in a linear oscillator there are no matrix elements at @xmath6 and hence a relatively weak microwave field is not expected to affect electron dynamics and resistivity properties of transport . of course",
    ", one can argue that impurities can generate harmonics being resonant at high @xmath7 but zrs is observed only in high mobility samples and thus the density of impurities is expected to be rather low .",
    "it is also important to note that zrs appears at high landau levels @xmath8 so that a semiclassical analysis of the phenomenon seems to be rather relevant .    in this work",
    "we develop the theoretical approach proposed in @xcite .",
    "this approach argues that impurities produce only smooth potential variations inside a bulk of a sample so that zrs at high @xmath9 appear from the orbits moving along sharp sample boundaries .",
    "it is shown @xcite that collisions with boundaries naturally generate high harmonics and that a moderate microwave field gives stabilization of edge channel transport of electrons in a vicinity of @xmath10 producing at these @xmath9 a resistance going to zero with increasing microwave power .",
    "this theory is based on classical dynamics of electrons along a sharp edge .",
    "the treatment of relaxation processes is modeled in a phenomenological way by a dissipative term in the newton equations .",
    "additional noise term in the dynamical equations takes into account thermal fluctuations .",
    "the dissipation leads to synchronization of cyclotron phase with a phase of microwave field producing stabilization of edge transport along the edges in a vicinity of resonant @xmath11 values .",
    "thus , according to the edge stabilization theory @xcite the zrs phase is related to a universal synchronization phenomenon which is a well established concept in nonlinear sciences @xcite .    while the description of edge transport stabilization @xcite captures a number of important features observed in zrs experiments it assumes that the contribution of bulk orbits in transport is negligibly small .",
    "this assumption is justified for smooth potential variations inside the bulk of a sample .",
    "however , a presence of isolated small scale scatterers inside the bulk combined with a smooth potential component can significantly affect the transport properties of electrons ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "also the majority of theoretical explanations of zrs phenomenon considers only a contribution of scattering in a bulk @xcite .",
    "thus it is necessary to analyze how a scattering on a single impurity is affected by a combined action of magnetic and microwave fields . in this work",
    "we perform such an analysis modeling impurity by a rigid circular disk of finite radius .",
    "we show that the dynamics in a vicinity of disk has significant similarities with dynamics of orbits along a sharp edge leading to appearance of zrs type features in a resistivity dependence on @xmath9 .",
    "the paper is composed as follows : in section ii we discuss the dynamics in edge vicinity , in section iii we analyze scattering on a single disk , in section iv we study scattering on many disks when their density is low , here we determine the resistivity dependence on @xmath9 and other system parameters , physical scales of zrs effects are analyzed in section v , effects of two microwave driving fields and other theory predictions are considered in section vi , discussion of the results is given in section vii .",
    "we study various models which we list here for a reader convenience : wall model described by the newton equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) with microwave field polarization perpendicular to the wall ( model ( w1 ) equivalent to model ( 1 ) in @xcite ) ; the chirikov standard map description ( [ eq3 ] ) of the wall model dynamics called model ( w2 ) ( equivalent to model ( 2 ) in @xcite at parameter @xmath12 ) ; the single disk model with radial microwave field called model ( dr1 ) ; the chirikov standard map description ( [ eq3 ] ) of model ( dr1 ) called model ( dr2 ) ( here @xmath13 in ( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath14 ) ; the model of a single disk in a linearly polarized microwave field and static electric field called model ( d1 ) ; the model of transport in a system with many disks called model ( d2 ) which extends the model ( d1 ) ; extension of model ( d2 ) with disk roughness and dissipation in space called model ( d3 ) ; the wall model ( w2 ) extended to two microwave fields is called model ( w3 ) .",
    "we remind first the approach developed in @xcite . here , the classical electron dynamics is considered in a proximity of the fermi surface and in a vicinity of sample edge modeled as a specular wall .",
    "the motion is described by newton equations @xmath15 where a dimensionless vector @xmath16 describes microwave driving field @xmath17 . here",
    "an electron velocity @xmath18 is measured in units of fermi velocity @xmath19 and @xmath20 describes a relaxation processes to the fermi surface .",
    "we also use the dimensionless amplitude of velocity oscillations induced by a microwave field @xmath21 . as in @xcite , in the following we use units with @xmath22 .",
    "the last two terms @xmath23 and @xmath24 in ( [ eq1 ] ) account for elastic collisions with the wall and small angle scattering .",
    "disorder scattering is modeled as random rotations of @xmath25 by small angles in the interval @xmath26 with poissonian distribution over time interval @xmath27 .",
    "the amplitude of noise is assumed to be relatively small so that the mean free path @xmath28 is much larger than the cyclotron radius @xmath29 .",
    "we note that the dissipative term is also known as a gaussian thermostat @xcite or as a landau - stuart dissipation @xcite . the dynamical evolution described by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is simulated numerically using the runge - kutta method .",
    "following @xcite we call this system model ( w1 ) ( equivalent to model ( 1 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "we note that for typical experimental zrs parameters we have : electron density @xmath30 , effective electron mass @xmath31 , microwave frequency @xmath32 , fermi energy @xmath33 , corresponding to @xmath34 , with fermi velocity @xmath35 . at such a frequency",
    "the cyclotron resonance @xmath36 takes place at @xmath37 with the cyclotron radius @xmath38 . at such a magnetic field",

    "we have the parameter @xmath42 . with these physical values of system parameters",
    "we can always recover the physical quantities from our dimensionless units with @xmath43 .",
    "examples of orbits running along the edge of specular wall are given in @xcite ( see fig.1 there ) .",
    "a microwave field creates resonances between the microwave frequency @xmath1 and a frequency of nonlinear oscillations of orbits colliding with the wall . due to a specular nature of this collisions",
    "the electron motion has high harmonics of cyclotron frequency that leads to appearance of resonances around @xmath44 ( there is an additional shift of approximate value @xmath45 to @xmath11 values due to a finite width of nonlinear resonance ) .    to characterize the dynamical motion it is useful to construct the poincar section following the standard methods of nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian case at @xmath46 in absence of noise .",
    "also we choose a linear polarized microwave field being perpendicular to the wall which is going along @xmath47-axis ( same geometry as in @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the generalized momentum @xmath48 is an integral of motion since there are no potential forces acting on electron along the wall ( here we use the landau gauge with a vector potential @xmath49 ) .",
    "the momentum @xmath50 determines a distance @xmath51 between a cyclotron center and the wall , which also remains constant in time .",

    "we see that at a small @xmath70 the main part of the phase space is covered by invariant curves corresponding to integrable dynamics .",
    "however , a presence of chaotic component with scattered points is also visible in a vicinity of separatrix of resonances , especially at large @xmath71 .",
    "the points at @xmath72 close to zero correspond to orbits only slightly touching the wall , while the orbits at @xmath73 have a large cyclotron radius and collide with the wall almost perpendicularly .",
    "there are also sliding orbits which have the center of cyclotron orbit inside the wall @xmath74 but we do not discuss they here .",
    "indeed , the orbits , which only slightly touch the wall ( @xmath75 ) , play the most important role for transport since the scattering angles in the bulk are small for high mobility samples and an exchange between bulk and edge goes via such type of dominant orbits @xcite .",
    "we note that the section of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] at @xmath57 , @xmath76 is in a good agreement with those shown in fig.1b of @xcite .",
    "however , here we have single invariant curves while in @xcite the curves have a certain finite width .",
    "this happens due to the fact that in @xcite the poincar section was done with trajectories having different values of the integral @xmath68 that gave some broadening of invariant curves . for a fixed integral value",
    "we have no overlap between invariant curves as it is well seen in fig .  [ fig1 ] here .    the phase space in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] has a characteristic resonance at a certain @xmath77 value which position depends on @xmath9 @xcite",

    "the same result can be obtained via semiclassical quantization of edge states developed in @xcite .",
    "it also can be found from a geometric overlap between the wall and cyclotron circle .",

    "the data presented in this section show that electrons from the bulk part of the sample can be captured for a long time in edge vicinity thereby increasing the electron density near the edge .",
    "this effect is very similar to the accumulation of electrons on the edges of the electron cloud under zrs conditions that was reported for surface electrons on helium in @xcite .",
    "however we have to emphasize that the confinement potential for surface electrons is very different from the hard wall potential assumed in our simulations , as a consequence our results can not be applied directly to this case .",

    "another interesting experimental possibility of our theory verification is to take a hall bar of high mobility 2deg sample and put on it antidots with regular or disordered distribution ( it is important to have no direct collision - less path for a cyclotron radius in crossed _ dc-_electric and magnetic fields ) with a low density of antidot disks @xmath410 ( as in our numerical studies ) so that an average distance between antidots is larger than the cyclotron radius @xmath161 .",
    "the regular antidot lattices have been already realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "the effect of microwave field on electron transport in a regular lattice has been studied in the frame of ratchet transport in asymmetric lattices @xcite .",
    "even a case of symmetric circular antidots has been studied in @xcite but the lattice was regular and no special attention was paid to analysis of resistivity at zrs resonant regime with @xmath136 .",
    "we think that the experimental condition of @xcite can be relatively easy modified to observe the zrs effect on disk scatterers discussed here .",
    "above we presented theoretical and numerical results which in our opinion explain the appearance of microwave induced zrs in high mobility samples .",
    "the synchronization theory of zrs proposed in @xcite and extended here is based on a clear physical picture : high harmonics @xmath411 are generated by collisions with sharp edge boundary or isolated impurities which are modeled here by specular disks .",
    "the zrs phases appear in a vicinity of resonant values @xmath412 . at these @xmath11 values",
    "the cyclotron phase of electron motion becomes synchronized with the microwave phase due to dissipative processes present in the system .",
    "for trajectories at the edge vicinity this synchronization gives stabilization of propagation along edge channels that creates an exponential drop of resistivity contribution of these channels with decreasing amplitude of thermal noise and increasing amplitude of microwave field .",
    "the contribution to resistivity from trajectories in the bulk is analyzed in the frame of scattering on many well separated disk impurities . here again the synchronization of cyclotron phase with the microwave phase takes place approximately at the same resonant @xmath11 values . at these @xmath11 values",
    "the synchronization leads to long time capture of trajectories in disk vicinity . during this long time",
    "an initial cyclotron phase is washed out by noisy fluctuations and many rotations around disk and thus an electron escapes from a disk with an average zero displacement along the applied _",
    "dc-_field even if dynamics in disk vicinity is dissipative .",
    "this provides the main mechanism of suppression of dissipative resistivity contribution from isolated impurities in the bulk . as a result",
    "the contribution of bulk to dissipative conductivity @xmath413 is suppressed , as it was assumed in @xcite , and the main contribution to current is given by electron propagation along edge states stabilized by a microwave field .",
    "as we showed above the resonance width or resonance energy scale @xmath350 are approximately the same for the disk and wall cases ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ,  [ eq5 ] ) ) .",
    "we note that for the disk case the energy @xmath350 is not sensitive to the disk radius as soon as it is significantly smaller than the cyclotron radius .",
    "thus we expect that at @xmath11 values the conductivity @xmath413 in the bulk is suppressed by a microwave field and at these fields the current is flowing essentially along stabilized edge states . in the case of corbino geometry",
    "we have radial conductivity @xmath414 which is determined by the bulk scattering and now the minima of @xmath414 are located at @xmath11 values ( see e.g figs .  [ fig12 ] , [ fig13],[fig14 ] where @xmath415 ) .",
    "the zrs experiments performed in the corbino geometry give minima of @xmath414 at these @xmath11 values ( see e.g. @xcite ) being in agreement with the synchronization theory .",
    "it is interesting to note that the nonlinear dynamics in vicinity of edge and disk impurity is well described by the chirikov standard map @xcite .",
    "the map description explains the location of resonances at integer values of @xmath9 with an additional shift @xmath370 produced by a finite separatrix width of nonlinear resonance .",
    "a finite rigidity of wall or disk potential can give a modification of this shift @xmath103 .",
    "our results show that the zrs phases at @xmath11 appear only at weak noise corresponding to high mobility samples .",
    "strong noise destroys synchronization and trajectories are no more captured at edge or disk vicinity .",
    "we also note that internal sample potentials with significant gradients act like a strong local _ dc-_field which destroys stability regions around disk impurities or near edge . due to",
    "that the zrs effect exists only in high mobility samples .",
    "the resistance at zrs minima drops significantly with the growth of microwave field strength since it increases the amplitude of nonlinear resonance which captures the synchronized trajectories .",
    "the synchronization theory of zrs is based on classical dynamics of noninteracting electrons .",
    "it is possible that electron - electron interaction effects can also suppress the contribution to resistivity from neutral short range range scatterers ( interface roughness , adatoms , ... ) .",
    "indeed , long capture times can increase the electron density around these short ranged impurities transforming them into long range charged scatters that the other electrons can circumvent by adiabatically following the long range component of the disorder potential thereby avoiding a scattering event .",
    "however , the theoretical description of this short - ranged impurity cloaking mechanism for the zrs effect remains a serious challenge .",
    "another important step remains the development of a quantum synchronization theory for zrs . even if in experiments the landau level is relatively high @xmath416 , there are only about ten landau levels inside a nonlinear resonance @xcite and quantum effects should play a significant role .",
    "the general theoretical studies show that the phenomenon of quantum synchronization persists at small effective values of planck constant @xmath417 but it becomes destroyed by quantum fluctuations at certain large values of @xmath417 @xcite .    the importance of quantum zrs theory is also related to a short range nature of the impurities considered here , typically on a scale of a few nanometers or even less . we have modeled these impurities by disks with a radius that was only several times ( in fact @xmath9 times ) smaller than the cyclotron radius which is not so close to microscopic reality .",
    "we could argue that in the quantum case a nanometer sized impurity would act effectively as an impurity of a size of quantum magnetic length @xmath418 .",
    "this gives a ratio @xmath419 which is comparable with the one used in our simulations with @xmath420 but of course a quantum treatment of scattering on nanometer size impurity in crossed electric and magnetic and also microwave fields remains a theoretical challenge .",
    "we note that such type of scattering can be efficiently analyzed by tools of quantum chaotic scattering ( see e.g. @xcite ) and we expect that these tools will allow to make a progress in the quantum theory development of striking zrs phenomenon .",
    "we hope that the synchronization theory of microwave induced zrs phenomenon described here can be tested in further zrs experiments .",
