    "in the last decades point contact spectroscopy has been proved to be a very powerful method to study electron - phonon interaction in metals ( for reviews see , and ) . in the recent years",
    "it has been realized that in mesoscopic metallic systems the electron scattering by some dynamical defects may play a major role in understanding the energy relaxation and dephasing processes of the electrons at low temperature ( for reviews see and ) .",
    "such defects can also be studied by point contact spectroscopy provided that they are situated in the contact region .",
    "these defects can either be magnetic impurities or structural defects where an atom or a group of atoms have a metastable , almost double degenerate groundstate forming a two - level system ( tls ) .",
    "the tls spectroscopy is very similar to the phonon spectroscopy , but as the tlss can not propagate like phonons , they are not in thermal equilibrium with the bath",
    ". the tls can be formed as defects in the bulk region of crystalline materials , or at dislocations , at surfaces due to impurities and also in amorphous materials . in most of the cases",
    "the internal structure of the tlss are unknown and they can behave very differently .    the dynamics of magnetic impurities shows the kondo effect@xcite where by lowering the temperature a kondo resonance is developed at the range of the characteristic kondo temperature , @xmath0 and approaching zero temperature a magnetic singlet is formed by the impurity spin and the electrons . in that case near zero temperature the magnetic singlet acts just like a static impurity and the dynamical processes are frozen out .",
    "the subject of slow defects can be described by the conventional theory of tlss and its application to the point contact is the present review .",
    "there are , however , many experimental facts which can not be described in that way , and show resemblance to the magnetic kondo anomalies even if their magnetic origin is very unlikely .",
    "we make an effort to point at those experiments by comparing the observed behavior with the predictions of the slow tls model .",
    "several of these are believed to be due to dynamical defects , different from slow tls .",
    "it must be emphasized that there is no theory which is generally accepted and can be applied .",
    "earlier it has been proposed that they are fast tlss , which can be described by the so called two - channel kondo model.@xcite that proposal has recently been criticized and debated.@xcite these scatterers now appear rather as `` phantoms '' and the present review does not cover that issue , we , however , present the earlier interpretation just to help in reading the earlier experimental publications .    * . in that case an atom or a group of atoms can have a transition between the two states of lowest energies by direct tunneling or at higher temperature by thermal excitation over the barrier . in the former case",
    "those systems are also called as tunneling centers ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "the transition rate can be on the scale of seconds and even on longer scales . in that case",
    "e.g. the specific heat may depend on the speed of the measurement as to reach thermal equilibrium takes longer time .",
    "the resistivity of such mesoscopic system may jump in time between two or several values on the above time scale , as in small mesoscopic systems the resistivity depends on the position of a single atom even if the two possible atomic positions are much smaller than an atomic distance .",
    "the study of point contacts containing tlss in the contact region turned out to be very powerful as the tls may result in zero bias anomalies shown by the @xmath1 characteristics .",
    "the electron passing through the point contact can interact dynamically with the tls or it can be elastically scattered , which scattering depends on the actual position of the atom forming the tls",
    ". the inelastic scattering may result in a back - scattering of the electron in which case the electron does not proceed from one electrode to the other when the applied voltage is larger than the splitting of the tls and the process shows up as a resistivity minimum at zero bias . in the case of elastic scattering",
    "the transmission rate may depend on the position of a single atom and the anomalies can have either sign .",
    "the characteristic relaxation times from the tls causing slow telegraph fluctuation of resistance to those being responsible for zero bias anomalies in the @xmath1 curve varies over several orders of magnitude , but for all these so - called slow tlss the average transition time is much longer than the electron - tls interaction time . *",
    "the fast tlss are strongly debated whether they can show kondo anomaly.@xcite here we present the previous ideas just to make contact with the extended literature , and the present status of the problem will be discussed at the end of the paper . if a conduction electron experiences several switching occasions one after the other we speak about fast tls .",
    "these fast tlss may show kondo anomaly as the tls s two states can be described by a quasi - spin replacing the real impurity spin of the magnetic kondo problem and the scattered electron can have different spherical momenta e.g. @xmath2- and @xmath3-states playing similar role to the real spin of the conduction electron .",
    "the spin - flip process of the magnetic kondo problem is replaced in the latter case by electron assisted transition between the two states of the tls .",
    "that trasnition was is originally believed to be electron assisted tunneling , which is unlikely according to the present theories,@xcite however an electron assisted transition without tunneling is still possible.@xcite in point contacts containing magnetic impurities the kondo resonance scattering contributes to the back - scattering rate , thus the kondo impurities result in zero bias peak in the dynamical resistivity , which has a width characterized by the kondo temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "the sign of the peak is just opposite to those caused by slow tlss .",
    "i.k . yanson and his co - workers@xcite and also other groups@xcite studied the zero bias anomalies due to intentionally placed magnetic impurities .",
    "considering the kondo effect there is a significant difference between the magnetic case and the tls . in the latter case",
    "the conduction electrons , additionally to their angular momenta occurring in the hamiltonian and the coupling , have a further degree of freedom , the real spin , which makes the electronic sea double degenerate although it does not appear in the coupling constants . referring to that extra degeneracy",
    "the phenomenon is called two - channel kondo problem ( 2-ck ) in contrast to the magnetic one - channel case ( 1-ck ) ( for earlier review see ) .",
    "that extra degeneracy prevents the system to have a singlet ground state at low temperature , it has finite entropy and , therefore , the fermi liquid behavior does not show up as far as a low energy cutoff ( e.g. the energy difference between the two lowest states of the tls , known as splitting ) is reached as the temperature is lowered .",
    "+ the condition for the formation of a 2-ck ground state is that the energy splitting is negligible compared to the kondo temperature , which is generally not expected .",
    "the zero bias anomalies have been believed to be powerful tools to make difference between 1-ck and 2-ck problems ( for a review see ) .",
    "for example annealing or electromigration could result in disappearance or modification of the zero bias anomalies in the case of structural defects while such effects are not expected for magnetic impurities.@xcite similar issues also appear in the electron dephasing time which has been intensively debated recently@xcite . another version of the two - channel kondo effect was proposed to explain the zero bias anomalies in uru@xmath4si@xmath4 point contacts@xcite where two degenerate localized electron orbitals of the u atom play the role of the tls which interact with the conduction electrons.@xcite    the issue of the 2-ck problem was responsible for the great interest in the zero bias anomalies due to tls and , therefore , it has a great importance to distinguish between anomalies due to slow tlss and fast scatterers .",
    "even if a considerable amount of the discussions are carried out considering fast tlss there is no doubt that in many cases the slow ones are dominant e.g. where the zero bias anomaly in the point contact spectrum has a positive sign.@xcite working on the issues listed above we learned that the literature on the theory of slow tlss in point contacts is very much scattered over many papers and journals , the predictions should be collected from a large number of papers , especially , published in russian and ukrainian physical journals some of them not available at smaller libraries .",
    "that experience encouraged us to collect and at several occasions to complete those results .",
    "the present review is written in a self - contained manner , thus no further reading is necessary to follow the theory .",
    "we want to emphasize that the authors did not consider as a task to give the historically proper complete list of references but they picked up those which are the most appropriate ones to get further information .",
    "the model of two level tunneling systems was at first introduced to explain the unexpected low - temperature behavior of specific heat and thermal conductivity in disordered solids which can not be described by phonon excitations.@xcite the model based on two level systems , which was able to explain the linear temperature dependence of specific heat of amorphous dielectrics at low temperatures was suggested by anderson , halperin and varma@xcite and phillips.@xcite this so - called tunneling model assumes that in an amorphous state some atoms or groups of atoms may switch between two , energetically nearly equivalent configurations .",
    "this situation is modeled as a double well potential with two stable states differing by energy @xmath5 , and a potential barrier between them with a tunneling rate @xmath6 ( see fig .",

    "are not isolated objects , but they interact with their neighborhood . for instance",
    "a strain induced by an elastic wave may change the parameters of the two level systems .",
    "it is assumed that only the asymmetry parameter @xmath5 is influenced by an elastic wave , thus the interaction between two level systems and phonons can be treated as a perturbation in @xmath5 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the coupling constant , and @xmath31 is the appropriate local elastic strain tensor .    in metallic samples",
    "the coupling to conduction electrons has to be taken into account as well .",
    "the general form of the hamiltonian describing the interaction between the electrons and the tls is:@xcite h_el - tls=__1,_2 , + , , b^+_a^+__2v^__1_2a__1b _ , [ gen_int_tls ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the electron creation and annihilation operators , @xmath34 is the spin index of the electron and @xmath11 is the interaction matrix element , which can be decomposed in terms of pauli operators:@xcite v^__1_2=_i = x , y , z v^i__1_2^i_+v^0__1_2_.

    "the interaction hamiltonian is further simplified if the electron - tls interaction time is much shorter than the transition time of the tls , thus the tls stays in a given position during the electron scattering .",
    "for these so - called slow two level systems the electron assisted transitions described by @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be neglected , and the hamiltonian is : h_el - tls=__1,_2 , v^z__1_2a^+__2a__1 _ , ^z_b^+_b_+__1,_2,v^0__1_2a^+__2a__1 _ , _ b^+_b _ , [ int_slowtls]the interaction matrix elements between the delocalized energy eigenstates are : e_-|h_el - tls|e_+=__1,_2,a__2^a__1,[matrix_elements_inel]which gives the amplitude of the electron s inelastic scattering on the tls , which is associated with an energy change , @xmath40 .",

    "the interaction strength , @xmath43 can be estimated as : @xmath44,@xcite as the difference between the electron scattering amplitudes in the two positions must be proportional to the distance of those positions on the scale of the fermi wavelength , and the strength of the scattering , @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath45 is very model dependent , e.g.  the tunneling atom can be different from the most of the atoms .",
    "the electron assisted transition processes are only important in the case of fastly relaxing two level fluctuators . in this case the hamiltonian given by eq .",

    "in contrast to the single - channel kondo problem , which has a non - degenerated , @xmath51 ground state because of the spin compensation cloud formed by the conduction electrons , the ground state of the two channel kondo problem has a non - zero entropy . in the two channel kondo model the conduction electrons overscreen the impurity spin by forming a non - trivial spin state . the low temperature regime of the two channel kondo model was found to have non - fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "this paper is devoted to review the literature of the slow tlss and point contacts .",
    "the kondo regime of the tlss is out of present consideration , but one can find an up - to - date review of this field in the work of cox and zawadowski.@xcite      in the previous part of this section the scattering rates due to tlss are calculated in born approximation . considering only the screening interaction @xmath43 and ignoring the assisted tunneling rates ( @xmath52 ) kondo@xcite has found power law correction to the tunneling rate which is due to the building up of a screening cloud or friedel oscillation around the changed position of the tunneling atom .",
    "that is closely related to the anderson s orthogonality catastrophe@xcite and the x - ray absorption problem ( see e.g.  ) .",

    "is used for @xmath53 ( see e.g.  ) .",
    "the behavior of a tls coupled to electronic heat bath ( ohmic region ) by the coupling @xmath53 has been studied in great detail ( see e.g.   and ) . in general",
    "there are two different regions regarding the coupling strength @xmath53 . here",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath5 is disregarded and @xmath62 is taken .    * . at @xmath63",
    "the atom has a periodic motion between the two positions . as @xmath53",
    "is increased the oscillation is more damped and the renormalized tunneling frequency @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the high frequency cutoff , which has first believed to be the electronic bandwidth ( see e.g. , but according to the adiabatic renormalization it is rather the energy scale of the lower excitations in the potential well where several excited levels are considered.@xcite * . the motion is incoherent and the atom is spending longer times in a position before tunneling as @xmath53 is increased .",
    "many experimental facts indicate ( see next subsection ) that the tlss are in the first region ( @xmath58 ) and even can be in the weak coupling limit ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the main issue is how the quasielastic and inelastic scattering rates are modified by the coupling @xmath53 .",
    "that problem was investigated by h. grabert , s. linkwitz , s. dattagupta , u. weiss@xcite considering the neutron scattering by tls .",
    "those results are very instructive for the present case , there are , however , essential differences :    * korringa type of relaxations are very important in the relaxation of the tls coupled to the ohmic electronic heat bath . if energy @xmath68 is transferred to the tls the spectrum of the tls is broadened by a relaxation rate proportional to @xmath68 . in the case of point contacts that energy may arise from the energy of the electron passing through the point contact . at finite bias , @xmath11 the system is , however , out of equilibrium and in the stationary state of the tls the averaged energy of the tls is proportional to @xmath11 also .",
    "thus , the nonequlibrium situation should be treated by using e.g. the keldysh technique.@xcite * the energy transfer is not determined by the applied voltage , in contrast to the neutron scattering experiment where the energy of the incoming and outgoing neutrons are simultaneously measured . in the present case by small change of the voltage the energy of the extra electrons passing through the point contact are given ( @xmath69 ) but the energy of the scattered electrons is not determined , thus the energy of the outgoing electron shows some distribution .",
    "that results in an additional smearing in the spectrum .    in the following we give a brief summary of the neutron scattering",
    "case.@xcite very accurate results are obtained for low temperature and energies except the range @xmath70 .",
    "that is certainly the interesting range considering especially for the long range tails of the characteristics which are crucial for the interpretations of the experiments.@xcite the calculation was carried out by expanding in the tunneling events and summing up .",
    "more comprehensive studies were performed by using numerical renormalization group@xcite for the entire energy range of energy and even including the asymmetry , @xmath5 and later even for nonequilibrium.@xcite .",
    "the previous results@xcite have a very good fit , by the formula @xmath71 where @xmath33 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are fitted parameters .",
    "that clearly shows a double peak structure with energies @xmath74 .",
    "the lines are broadened by a korringa type energy relaxation rate proportional to @xmath68 . in the nearly lorentzian lineshape no direct role of coupling @xmath53",
    "was discovered .",
    "those results are strongly indicating that in weak coupling region that would be very hard to discover any sign of anomalous relaxation rate in the tunneling characteristics .",
    "that situation is further complicated by the averaging over the distribution of the energy of the scattered electrons and the out of equilibrium situation .",
    "we find , that the experimental studies of the tunneling characteristics are not appropriate tool to look for the interaction effects , except that @xmath6 is renormalized .",
    "that situation is very different from the cases of one and two channel kondo impurities , where the characteristics are determined by the kondo resonances .",
    "there are several experimental methods to investigate the kinetics of tlss .",
    "the first two methods to be discussed are studying the tlss by their interaction with phonons . in",
    "heat release measurements the time dependence of heat release or specific heat is measured : after a sudden cool down of the sample due to the energy relaxation of the tlss it takes a long period of time to reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "the second group of measurements investigates the propagation of sound in amorphous materials measuring sound attenuation and sound velocity.@xcite    heat release measurements basically focus on amorphous dielectrics and superconductors , as in metals the contribution of conduction electrons to the heat capacity usually dominates that of tlss , thus the estimation of @xmath75 is more difficult . according to the heat release measurements of kol et al.@xcite in amorphous metal fe@xmath76b@xmath77si@xmath78 the density of the tlss is about @xmath79 .",
    "though in acoustic measurements basically the phonons are investigated , if the electron - tls coupling is strong , the results may significantly differ from that on amorphous dielectrics.@xcite a simple description for ultrasound absorption by two level systems is as follows .",
    "the occupation numbers for the upper and the lower states of the tls are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the probability for ultrasound absorption is @xmath82 , where @xmath14 is the ultrasound intensity , and @xmath16 is the absorption coefficient .",
    "the probability of relaxation is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the relaxation time of the tls . in balance",
    "these two quantities are equal , thus one obtains : @xmath85 the absorbed energy is : @xmath86 it is easy to see , that at large enough intensities ( @xmath87 ) , the energy absorption saturates to a value inversely proportional to the relaxation time ( @xmath88 ) . in insulators and semiconductors",
    "the available maximal ultrasound power is enough to drive the absorption into saturation at @xmath89k , but in metals such saturation is only obtained at temperatures as low as @xmath90mk .",
    "it implies that the relaxation times in metallic samples are much shorter than in disordered insulators .",
    "the interpretation for this experimental observation is , that the electron - tls scattering processes are dominating in the relaxation of tlss . assuming a standard korringa - like electron - tls relaxation , where an electron - hole pair is created , at low enough temperatures one obtains : @xmath91 that is , the ultrasound absorption measurements give the opportunity to make an estimation for the electron - tls coupling parameter ( @xmath53 ) , and the density of the tlss ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "in fact the acoustic properties of disordered metals do not show universal behavior as in the case of insulating glasses .",
    "there are several theoretical approaches ( the mentioned standard korringa - like relaxation,@xcite the strong coupling theory of vladr and zawadowski,@xcite the electron - polaron effect considered by kagan and prokofev@xcite ) that may explain the aspects of the relaxation of tlss due to conduction electrons.@xcite still , taking into account the simple electron - tls coupling given by eq .",
    "( [ gen_int_tls ] ) , the acoustic measurements can give estimations for the density of two level systems ( @xmath75 ) or the electron - tls coupling constant ( @xmath53 ) . in case of superconductors",
    "the korringa relaxation is suppressed by the presence of the superconducting gap , but the gap disappears if a high enough magnetic field is applied on the sample , switching on the tls - electron interaction.@xcite according to the measurements of esquinazi et al.@xcite in the normal and superconducting state of @xmath92 compared with the theory of kagan and prokofev@xcite the coupling parameter is approximately @xmath93 .",
    "the acoustic measurements of coppersmith and golding@xcite on the normal conducting amorphous metal pd@xmath94si@xmath95cu@xmath96 estimated the coupling constant as @xmath97 .",
    "for the density of the two level systems a lot of results are available in the literature , and it can be stated generally , that it is the same within a factor of less than 10 over a large variety of disordered material , being metallic glasses or dielectric amorphous material .",

    "a detailed review of heat release and acoustic measurements in disordered material can be found in , and for earlier data see .",
    "electron - tls interaction can be studied directly by measuring electric transport in disordered metals .",
    "point contact spectroscopy offers the possibility to investigate the properties of even a single two level system centered in the vicinity of the contact .",
    "the most spectacular sign of two level systems in point contacts is the so - called telegraph noise : the resistance of the contact is fluctuating between two ( or more ) discrete values on the timescale of seconds .",
    "one can estimate the average lifetimes in the excited ( @xmath98 ) and ground state ( @xmath99 ) by recording hundreds of transitions , and fitting the resulting histograms of lifetimes ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) with exponential decay functions ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively ) .",
    "the two life times are related to each other by the detailed balance , @xmath104 , where @xmath5 is the asymmetry parameter .",
    "if the tls jumps to the other state , the electron screening cloud also needs to rearrange , which makes the jumps of the tls slower .",

    "they argued that their samples were in the strong coupling limit , where the coupling of the tls to conduction electrons is very strong compared to the tunneling matrix element , thus the latter can be treated as a small perturbation . in this limit",
    "the tunneling of the tls is incoherent , because of the dephasing due to the fast oscillations of the electron bath . here a theoretical scaling function can be set up : @xmath106 , which does indeed agree with the experimental result .",

    "the effect of fastly relaxing tls in point contacts can not be resolved as a telegraph fluctuation of the resistance , it causes an anomalous behavior in the voltage dependence of the differential resistance around zero bias , a so - called zero bias anomaly ( zba ) , which will be a subject of detailed discussion in this review .",
    "metallic systems , where two macroscopic electrodes are connected via a contact with small cross section are called `` point contacts '' ( pc ) in general , regardless of the actual size of the contact area .",
    "it can be generally stated , that the resistance of a point contact is mostly determined by the narrow neighborhood of the junction ; therefore , a pc acts as a `` microscope '' magnifying all kinds of phenomena occurring in the small contact region .",
    "+ ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d )    several methods have been worked out to produce extremely small contacts between two conducting leads .",
    "figure  [ 4methods ] presents the four most important experimental techniques .",
    "the first one ( fig .",
    "[ 4methods]a ; ) is referred to as mechanically controllable break junction technique ( mcbj ) . here the sample ( practically a piece of metallic wire )",
    "is fixed on the top of a flexible beam , and a small notch is established between the anchoring points . the contact is created in situ at low temperature by breaking the sample with bending the beam , thus one obtains clear and adjustable junction on atomic length scale .",
    "the second method ( fig .",
    "[ 4methods]b ; ) uses nanolithography to establish a small hole in a silicon nitride insulating membrane by etching .",
    "if the etching is stopped just when the hole breaks through , the diameter at the bottom edge remains extremely small ( @xmath110 3 nm ) , well below the usual resolution of lithography ( @xmath110 40 nm ) . in the next step metal",
    "is evaporated on both sides , creating a high - quality point contact device .",
    "this method can provide extremely stable and clear contacts on atomic length scale , however the contact diameter can not be varied during the measurement .",
    "the third drawing ( fig .",
    "[ 4methods]c ) shows a similar arrangement to a scanning - tunneling microscope , a so - called spear - anvil geometry : a vertically movable , sharply tapered needle is pressed onto a flat surface . finally , fig .",
    "[ 4methods]d shows a simple technique , where the edges of two wires are brought into contact . in arrangements ( a ) , ( c ) and ( d )",
    "usually a differential screw mechanism is used to adjust the contact supplemented with a piezo - crystal for fine tuning .",
    "the first application of point contacts was carried out by igor yanson@xcite to investigate electron - phonon scattering in nanojunctions .",
    "he found , that the point contact spectrum , obtained as the second derivative of current with respect to the bias voltage ( @xmath111 ) contains structure due to the electron - phonon interaction described by the eliashberg function @xmath112.@xcite this simple method for measuring electron - phonon interaction spectrum became a popular application of pc spectroscopy , however , it can be used to probe other electron scattering processes as well , like electron - tls interaction , which is the central topic of this paper .",
    "theoretically , point - contacts are considered as two bulk electrodes connected through a narrow constriction .",
    "the simplest , and most commonly used pc model is presented in fig .",
    "[ pcmodels.fig]a .",
    "this so - called opening - like point contact is an orifice with diameter @xmath8 in an infinite isolating plane between the two electrodes .",
    "another extreme limit is the channel - like pc : a long , narrow neck between the bulk regions with the length being much larger than the diameter , @xmath113 ( fig .  [ pcmodels.fig]b ) .",
    "the crossover between the both cases can be obtained by considering the point - contacts as rotational hyperboloids with different opening angles ( fig .",

    "these processes give a strongly voltage dependent correction to the current , for instance at zero temperature backscattering can only occur if the voltage bias exceeds the excitation energy of the tls .",
    "the nonlinear current correction due to the inelastic scattering of the electrons on a single tls can be explicitly given , if the occupation number of the upper level @xmath231 , the electron - tls coupling strength @xmath373 , and the geometrical factor @xmath710 are known .",
    "it has crucial importance that the interaction of a tls with the neighborhood is dominated by the electron - tls scattering , and the phonon contribution is significantly smaller because of the relatively small phonon phase space at energies much smaller than the debye energy .",
    "therefore , the excited tls mainly relaxes its energy through the electrons , which have a nonequilibrium distribution near the contact . as a consequence ,",
    "the tls occupation number is also not the equilibrium one , and it is strongly voltage dependent .",
    "the value of @xmath347 can be determined by a simple dynamical equation using fermi s golden rule .",
    "due to voltage dependence of @xmath231 a nonlinear current correction arises from the elastic scattering of the electrons on the tls as well , provided that the scattering cross sections are different for the two states of the tls . both for the elastic and inelastic scattering",
    "the point contact spectrum ( i.e.  the second derivative of the @xmath711 curve ) shows a sharp peak at the excitation energy of the tls , and a background tail at higher voltages due to the nonequilibrium occupations .",
    "the current correction due to the scattering on a single tls can also be determined for a diffusive point contact . in this case",
    "the equations are more difficult , as the collision integral due to the elastic scattering on defects should also be included in the boltzmann equation .",
    "surprisingly , the lengthy calculations give exactly the same results as in ballistic contacts , just the geometrical prefactors are different .",
    "the response to a time dependent bias voltage was also reviewed . due to the nonlinearity of the @xmath711 curve",
    "the application of a small ac modulation beside the dc bias causes two important features in the response signal : ( i ) a second harmonic signal is generated , ( ii ) the average value of the current is shifted , which is referred to as the dc shift signal .",
    "if the frequency of the ac modulation is much smaller than the relaxation frequency of the tls and its amplitude is small compared to the energy splitting , then both of these signals are proportional to the second derivative of the @xmath711 curve . on the other hand ,",
    "if the modulating signal is fast compared to the relaxation of the tls then the occupation number @xmath231 can not follow the variation of the bias voltage , which has important consequences .",
    "previously it was believed that in the high frequency limit both the elastic and inelastic contributions from the scattering on the tls are completely suppressed in the response signal .",
    "our more detailed calculations have shown that the dc shift signal contains a frequency independent contribution due to the rectification at voltages in the range of the tls energies thus it is not decisive for the relaxation dynamics of the tls .",
    "we have demonstrated that both the elastic and inelastic contributions are almost independent of the irradiation frequency in the dc shift signal .",
    "a more appropriate quantity for these studies is the second harmonic generation signal . in this case",
    "the elastic contribution is completely suppressed and the inelastic contribution shrinks by a factor of @xmath692 if the irradiation frequency exceeds the relaxation frequency of the tls .",
    "we have also investigated the phase shift in the second harmonic signal which might be examined in subsequent experimental studies .",
    "there is another suggestion by kozub and rudin@xcite to explain zero bias anomalies based on the adiabatic renormalization of the splitting of the tls by electrons .",
    "that gives , however , a weak temperature dependence because the main contribution comes from the electrons far from the fermi energy , thus that is not related to infrared singularities .",
    "the interaction between the tls due to the friedel oscillation was also considered and magnetic field dependence is suggested .",
    "however , it is hard to compare the theory with experiment in its present form .",
    "it is also interesting to note that tlss and magnetic impurities interacting with metallic electrons show several similar features .",
    "both could lead to logarithmic corrections known as the kondo effect .",
    "the main similarity is that the spin @xmath712 has also two states . without external magnetic field or internal magnetic field characteristic to the spin glass systems the two states @xmath713",
    "are degenerate , just like a tls without splitting ( @xmath714 ) . in that case the occupations of the two spin states",
    "@xmath715 and that can not be affected by the applied voltage on the point contact because of spin degeneracy . in born approximation that gives a single peak at zero bias in the point contact spectra @xmath716 , and",
    "no background occurs .",
    "the logarithmic kondo corrections , however , broaden the peak which looks very similar to background in case of phonons and tls , but that is not due to a nonequilibrium distribution.@xcite the situation is different , where the spin degeneracy is lifted by the magnetic field . in that case @xmath717 ,",
    "thus the occupation numbers depend on the applied voltage and background occurs even without kondo corrections .    in the following section",
    "the former experimental results are discussed and confronted with the model of slow two level systems .",
    "this review is aimed at collecting and summarizing the main results concerning the theory of the scattering on slow two - level systems in point contacts , and to compare those with the experiments . as a point contact probes the restricted area around the contact region ,",
    "it can be used to investigate a few or even a single tls located in the contact area .",
    "therefore , some measurements can be directly used to study the nature of tlss in the contact region , and to check the relevance of the model presented .    in disordered metallic point contacts tlss with a wide variety of relaxation times",
    "can be present .",
    "a spectacular sign of the presence of tlss in a point contact is the telegraph fluctuation of resistance , caused by defects fluctuating between metastable configurations on an experimentally resolvable timescale.@xcite examples for such so - called two level fluctuators are shown in fig .",
    "[ buhrmantls ] .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the simplest telegraph fluctuation : the resistance is switching between two values , as discussed by considering the elastic processes ( see sec .  [ elasticscattering ] ) , while the switching itself is an inelastic process . in panel",
    "( b ) two independent telegraph fluctuations are superimposed upon each other , while on panel ( c ) and ( d ) one two - level fluctuator modulates the amplitude or the average switching time of the other .",
    "the screening of these two - level systems by electrons causes a slow - down of the tls motion which can be described by the renormalization of the tunneling amplitude.@xcite this phenomenon can be used to estimate the electron - tls coupling constant , as it is discussed in and .",
    "this review concentrates on slow tlss where the relaxation time is much larger than the electron - tls interaction time , but still the tls is fast enough not to be able to resolve it as a telegraph fluctuation of the resistance .",
    "it was seen , that such `` slow '' tlss can be studied by point - contact spectroscopy , a singularity in the pc spectrum ( @xmath718 ) is expected if the voltage bias coincides with the energy splitting of the tls close to the contact .",
    "figures [ ball_cent ] and [ secder_ball ] demonstrated that the contributions of both the elastic and inelastic scattering exhibit this anomaly at @xmath397 . in the inelastic case",
    "this anomaly always corresponds to a maximum of the differential conductance , @xmath719 , which is reflected by a negative peak in the point contact spectrum @xmath720 at @xmath397 . in the elastic case a similar peak",
    "is observed , however its sign can either be negative or positive , depending on the sign of @xmath400 ( see eq .",
    "[ iel ] ) .",
    "a similar peak is expected in the pc spectrum for fast kondo - like tlss , for which the electron assisted transition processes are not negligible ( see sec .  [ fasttls ] ) . for the fast tlss",
    "the anomaly appears as a minimum in the differential conductance around zero bias , and the width of the zero bias minimum is determined by the kondo temperature @xmath0 .",
    "this feature is shown as a positive peak in the @xmath720 curve at @xmath721.@xcite that peak shows very strong similarity to the kondo peak in the presence of magnetic impurities,@xcite but no magnetic field dependence is observed , and the peak is changing by annealing .",
    "the sign of the anomaly has crucial importance in distinguishing the slow tlss from fast tlss . along this discussion",
    "the anomaly exhibiting a conductance maximum at zero bias is called `` positive '' zero bias anomaly ( zba ) , while the conductance minimum is called `` negative '' zba .",
    "we note that the labelling of the sign of the anomaly can be confusing , as in some cases the voltage dependence of either the differential conductance or the differential resistance is plotted , in other studies the point contact spectrum is presented .",
    "furthermore , concerning the pc spectrum , in theory the @xmath720 curves have direct physical meaning ( showing the excitation spectrum ) , whereas in experimental studies usually the second derivative of the inverse curve , @xmath720 is plotted .",
    "regardless of the way how the pc spectrum is plotted , the sign of the anomaly can be determined by comparing it with the sign of the contribution of the phonons .",
    "for the inelastic scattering on tlss the increase of the bias voltages causes an enhancement of the back - scattering , thus this anomaly has the same sign as the phonon part of the spectrum .",
    "in contrast , for kondo - like anomalies a resonant scattering is observed , which is restricted to the energy range of the kondo temperature . in this case the back - scattering is enhanced at zero bias , and it decreases as the bias is elevated above @xmath722 , thus the anomaly has negative sign compared to the phonon contribution . in terms of this labelling , the fast tlss should always show a negative anomaly , the inelastic contribution from slow tlss shows up as a positive anomaly , while the elastic contribution has an indefinite sign .    in the experiments",
    "different zero bias anomalies were observed .",
    "a basic distinction should be made between the experiments performed on pure metals , and those , performed on disordered systems , like metallic glasses . in the first case the temperature dependence of the bulk resistance",
    "does not show any anomalous behavior , but due to the magnifying effect of point contacts , the scattering on a few defects near the contact might be seen in the point contact spectrum . in this case",
    "the appearance of the anomaly depends on the way the contact is created , and usually the anomaly can be destroyed by annealing . in metallic glasses , however , a high degree of disorder is initially present , and the anomalous feature seen in the pc spectrum is also reflected by the anomalous low - temperature behavior of the bulk resistivity@xcite ( see also ) .",
    "several metallic contacts show anomalies with different signs depending on the way the contact is prepared . in the following we concentrate on a few typical and most interesting cases .",
    "the zero bias anomalies were widely studied in copper nanocontacts created with different methods .",
    "the first experiments by touching two cu electrodes@xcite reported a pronounced positive anomaly at @xmath723mev [ fig .  [ akimenko.fig]a ] .",
    "the zba has a highly asymmetric shape , which can be well fitted with the theoretical prediction for the elastic scattering on a single slow tls .",
    "the inelastic scattering could be excluded , as in this case the anomaly should show a basically symmetric peak with a background of opposite sign [ see fig .  [ secder_ballq ] ] . furthermore , as the zba has consequently shown a positive sign , a kondo - like explanation could also be excluded . in some occasions",
    "further low - energy peaks were also observed [ fig .",
    "[ akimenko.fig]b ] , which were argued to be due to the higher excitations of the tls .    ,",

    "these samples were created by vapor deposition , and judging from the residual resistance ratio and the intensity of the phonon peaks in the pc spectrum they were of low crystalline quality implying that the contacts were in the diffusive regime .",
    "however , the authors claim that the zba is not due to the intrinsic disorder of the sample , but it correlates with the amount of bending and stretching of the film . in these thin film samples",
    "the zba has consequently shown a positive sign , and it could be well fitted with the elastic scattering on a slow tls , similarly to the above discussed measurements of akimentko et al .",
    "the same work of keijsers et al.@xcite has also presented measurements on single crystal cu break junctions [ fig .  [ posneganomaly]b ] . in this case",

    "it turns out that the model of fast kondo - like tlss is in good agreement with the measurement , while the theory of slow tlss gives a poor fit because of the long tail of the pc spectrum.@xcite      the common feature in the yet reported zbas is that the anomaly appears in the voltage region @xmath729mv .",

    "that spectroscopy is complementary of tunneling spectroscopy with oxide barrier@xcite or break junction in the tunneling limit,@xcite but there are similarities and differences as well .",

    "the detailed studies of the frequency dependence based on the theoretical part of the present review would be especially useful and that would clarify some of the contradictions of the present time .",
    "it is very important to study further the resonances of unknown origin which have strong resemblance to nonmagnetic kondo behavior@xcite and to make attempts to determine their origin in at least a few cases .",
    "the origin of those resonances has been the subject of theoretical debates in the recent years .",
    "originally it was proposed that kondo effect could arise from tunneling tlss with non - commutative couplings e.g. due to the screening by electrons and electron assisted tunneling ( see e.g.  ) .",
    "it was shown , however , that the adiabatic screening of the moving atom by electrons depresses the tunneling rate in such a strong manner,@xcite that the actual kondo temperature is negligible .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the situation can be changed if the atom in the double potential well has the ground - state below the potential barrier , but the first excited state is above it.@xcite then this objection could be avoided , but the value of the splitting raises many questions . that theory for an intermediate heavy atom gives too small @xmath0 , not more than @xmath742k and that can not explain the resonances of typical width of @xmath743k .",
    "there is , however , the possibility of light atoms like hydrogen,@xcite as the dominating energy scale is the kinetic energy of the atom in the potential well .",
    "therefore , it would be very important in the future to study hydrogen defect either in atomic states or water contamination , where the hydrogen could still change its position .",
