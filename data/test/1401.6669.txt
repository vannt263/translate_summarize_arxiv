    "accurate prediction of finite amplitude acoustic waves traveling through biological media are essential in developing new therapy and imaging techniques for medical ultrasound applications .",
    "numerous experimental studies show that attenuation @xmath0 of biological media exhibits a power law dependence on frequency @xmath1 over the frequency range used in medical applications @xcite @xcite . in this sense , considering an initial monochromatic plane wave traveling through nonlinear media , two opposite effects govern the final wave amplitude : on one hand , higher harmonics appear and their amplitude grows as a consequence of nonlinear progressive wave steepening ; and on the other hand , the damping for each harmonic is different , following the above power law .",
    "therefore , differences in the frequency power law model can lead to huge differences in attenuation of higher harmonics , and hence the inclusion of frequency dependence attenuation is critical for correctly predict nonlinear propagation .",
    "classical thermo - viscous @xcite sound attenuation exhibit a squared frequency dependence , @xmath2 , however the empirically fitted power law for soft tissues typically ranges between @xmath3@xcite @xcite @xcite . for many tissues",
    "the attenuation shows a dependence that can be modeled by @xmath4 close to the unity , where the value varies from different tissues .",
    "moreover , for some individual examples the local value of @xmath4 exhibit lower values at low ultrasound frequencies and tends to 2 in the high frequency limit @xcite . despite the study of the physical mechanism besides this complex frequency dependence is out of the scope of this work , there exist numerous phenomenological approaches for including the observed losses in the acoustic equations@xcite @xcite . on the other hand , is common in literature to describe the losses in soft tissues as multiple - relaxation processes @xcite @xcite @xcite , where the relaxation frequencies can be associated to either a tissue specific physical mechanism or empirically optimized to fit the observed tissue attenuation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , fractional partial differential operators has been demonstrated the ability to describe frequency power law attenuation @xcite @xcite .",
    "these operators can be included in the modeling by means of time @xcite , space @xcite or combined time - space fractional derivatives @xcite @xcite",
    ". the latter operators can be biological motivated and derived from tissue micro - structure using fractal ladders based on networks of springs and dashpots @xcite .",
    "however , these fractional loss operators can be also derived from a continuum of relaxation process @xcite , that suggest that the two approaches can be equivalent under certain conditions @xcite .    in order to solve these models , many time - domain numerical methods have been developed .",
    "attenuation modeled by relaxation processes can be solved by means of finite - differences in time - domain ( fdtd ) solvers in linear regime @xcite and in nonlinear regime applied to augmented burger s equation @xcite , khokhlov - zabolotskaya - kuznetsov ( kzk ) @xcite and westervelt @xcite nonlinear wave equations . on the other hand",
    ", time - dependent fractional derivatives can be solved in nonlinear regime @xcite by convolutional operators .",
    "this approach requires the memory storage of certain time history , and although the memory can be strongly reduced compared to direct convolutions , this algorithm employs up to ten auxiliary fields and a memory buffer of three time steps . in order to overcome this limitation , time - space fractional derivatives or fractional laplacian @xcite @xcite can be used to model frequency power laws without time - domain convolutional operators .",
    "recently k - space and pseudo - spectral methods have been applied in order to solve fractional laplacian operators efficiently in nonlinear regime @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a numerical method that solves the complete set of equations ( continuity , momentum and state equations ) including nonlinear propagation and frequency power law attenuation based in multiple relaxation processes .",
    "the numerical method presented here is based on the fdtd method .",
    "the inclusion of relaxation processes in the presented formulation avoids convolutional operators so only one extra field per relaxation process is needed and no memory buffer is needed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ s : model ] the model equations that describes the problem are exposed , sec .",
    "[ s : numerical ] describes the computational method presented in this work and in sec .",
    "[ s : validation ] the method is validated comparing the numerical results with known analytic solutions for linear and nonlinear regimes .",
    "the principles of mass and momentum conservation lead to the main constitutive relations for nonlinear acoustic waves , which for a fluid can be expressed as @xcite @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total density field,@xmath8 is the particle velocity vector,@xmath9 is the pressure,@xmath10 and @xmath11 are the coefficients of shear and the bulk viscosity respectively .",
    "the acoustic waves described by this model exhibit viscous losses with squared power law dependence on frequency . in order to include a power law frequency dependence on the attenuation",
    ", a multiple relaxation model will be added into the time domain equations .",
    "the basic mechanism for energy loss in a relaxing media is the appearance of a phase shift between the pressure and density fields .",
    "this behavior is commonly modeled as a time dependent connection at the fluid state equation , that for a fluid retaining the nonlinear effects up to second order an be expressed as @xcite@xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the density perturbation over the stationary density @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the nonlinear parameter , @xmath16 is the small amplitude sound speed , and @xmath17 is the kernel associated with the relaxation mechanism .",
    "the first two terms describe the instantaneous response of the medium and the convolutional third term accounts for the  memory time \" of the relaxing media .",
    "thus , by choosing an adequate time function for the kernel @xmath17 the model can present an attenuation and dispersion response that fits the experimental data of the heterogeneous media .",
    "however , the direct resolution of the constitutive relations ( [ eq : continuity]-[eq : st_cont ] ) in this integral form is a complex numerical task due to the convolutional operator .",
    "thus , instead of describe @xmath17 with a specific time domain waveform , the response of the heterogeneous medium can be alternatively described by a sum of @xmath18 relaxation processes with exponential time dependence as : @xmath19 with the @xmath20-th order kernel expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the heaviside piecewise function @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the characteristic relaxation time and @xmath26 the relaxation parameter for the @xmath20-th order process .",
    "this last dimensionless parameter controls the amount of attenuation and dispersion for each process as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the sound speed in the high frequency limit associated to @xmath20-th order relaxation process , also known as the speed of sound in the  frozen \" state @xcite . in order to describe relaxation without the need of including a convolutional operator",
    ", we shall define a state variable @xmath29 for each process as @xmath30 thus , using the convolutional property @xmath31 , the time derivative of the relaxation state variable obeys the following relation for the n - th order process : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dirac delta function . using the eq .",
    "( [ eq : sn ] ) this relation becomes a simple ordinary differential equation for each process as : @xmath34 using again convolutional properties , we can substitute eq .",

    "( [ eq : st_final_c0 ] ) leads to : @xmath37 due to the smallness of the relaxation parameter , @xmath26 , i.e. when weak dispersion is modeled , the sound speed in the high frequency limit reduces to @xcite : @xmath38 note eq .",
    "( [ eq : st_final_cinf ] ) for a mono - relaxing media is equivalent to that can be found in literature @xcite @xmath39 thus , the constitutive relations to solve by means of the numerical method in the nonlinear regime are the continuity eq .",

    "although the aim of this work is to model biological media , the generalized formulation presented here can be used to describe the attenuation and hence the dispersion observed in other relaxing media , as the relaxation processes of oxygen and nitrogen molecules in air or the relaxation associated with boric acid and magnesium sulfate in seawater @xcite .      on the other hand ,",
    "if small amplitude perturbations are considered , an equivalent derivation of this model can be expressed for multiple relaxation media @xcite .",
    "thus , for an homogeneous inviscid relaxing fluid the linearized continuity and motion eq .",

    "( [ eq : lin_st ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin_cont ] ) yields @xmath44 then , taking the time derivative of the state variable eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsdt ] ) we get @xmath45 finally , substituting again the linearized state eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin_st ] ) and arranging terms the linearized continuity equation leads to @xmath46 on the other hand , the state evolution equation can be expressed as a function of the acoustic pressure as @xmath47 thus , the linearized governing eq .",

    "however , to obtain an explicit solution , the equations can be solved using an iterative solver . in this way , the future field values depend not only in the past values but also on unknown future values : @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 the fields in the above expressions with temporal index @xmath81 are the temporal averaged values and are calculated by the iterative solver as : @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 the initial value for the iterative solver is obtained by means of the explicit fdtd linear solution .",
    "this value is injected into the implicit system ( [ eq : solver1]-[eq : solver3 ] ) . due to the fact that the linear value is very similar to the nonlinear solution for a small time step",
    ", the iterative algorithm converges fast . in all the simulations presented in the validation section",
    "one iteration is used . finally , a leap - frog time marching is applied to solve each time step until the desired simulation time is reached .",
    "perfectly matched layers ( pml ) @xcite were placed in the limits of the domain ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) to avoid spurious reflections from the limits of the integration domain . inside the pml domains linearized acoustics equations",

    "these absorbent boundary conditions have reported an attenuation coefficient of 55.2 db for a layer of 30 elements and broadband wave with 1 mhz central frequency and non - normal incidence angle .",
    "the staggered grid is terminated on velocity nodes , so the coupling to the pml layers is implemented by only connecting these external nodes .",
    "this allows us to prevent the singularity of the cylindrical coordinate system : due to the staggered grid , the only variable discretized at @xmath87 is @xmath88 , and axisymmetric condition @xmath89 is applied there . to solve spatial differential operators on boundaries some  phantom \" nodes must be created with the conditions : @xmath90      the stability for the lossless algorithm follows the courant - friedrich - levy ( cfl ) condition ,",
    "so for uniform grid @xmath91 the maximum duration of the time step is limited by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the number of dimensions ( in our case , cylindrical axisymmetric coordinate system , @xmath94 ) .",
    "however , numerical instabilities have been observed when @xmath95 . due to this empirical relation , the maximum values for relaxation frequencies",
    "are limited too by the chosen spatial discretization by the simple relation @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the maximum relaxation frequency for all processes , @xmath98 is the number of elements per wavelength and @xmath99 the frequency of the propagating wave . at higher amplitudes nonlinear effects",
    "induce the growing of harmonics of the fundamental frequency of the initial wave . the diffusive viscosity term in the motion equation , eq . ( [ eq : momentum ] ) , attenuates the small wavenumbers , damping the  node to node \" numerical oscillations and ensuring numerical stability in weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "however , when discontinuities are present in the solution , extra numerical techniques must be employed to guarantee convergence . in this work artificial viscosity @xcite",
    "was added when shock waves are present in the solution .",
    "thus , by choosing the artificial viscosity as @xmath100 the algorithm shows consistency when @xmath101 , so if stability is achieved by the cfl condition , the convergence is guaranteed .",
    "thereby , the viscosity term ensures the entropy condition is fulfilled @xcite , and the method is able to solve shock waves in viscous fluids .",
    "in order to validate the frequency dependent attenuation and dispersion of the numerical method a simulation was done in linear regime including a single relaxation process .",
    "a homogeneous medium was considered , where the parameters were set to the typical values for water at 20 c : @xmath102 m / s , @xmath103 kg / m@xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 pa@xmath107s .",
