    "plasmons in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) can be utilized for terahertz ( thz ) devices .",
    "thz sources and detectors based on compound semiconductor heterostructures have been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensionality , which gives rise to the wavenumber - dependent frequency dispersion , and the high electron concentration on the order of @xmath3 @xmath4 allow us to have their frequency in the thz range with submicron channel length .",
    "most recently , a very high detector responsivity of the so - called asymmetric double - grating - gate structure based on an inp - based high - electron - mobility transistor was demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "however , resonant detection as well as single - frequency coherent emission have not been accomplished so far at room temperature , mainly owning to the damping rate more than @xmath3 s@xmath5 in compound semiconductors .",
    "plasmons in graphene have potential to surpass those in the heterostructures with 2degs based on the standard semiconductors , due to its exceptional electronic properties  @xcite .",
    "massive experimental and theoretical works have been done very recently on graphene plasmons in the thz and infrared regions ( see review papers refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "one of the most important advantages of plasmons in graphene over those in heterostructure 2degs is much weaker damping rate close to @xmath6 s@xmath5 at room temperature in disorder - free graphene suffered only from acoustic - phonon scattering  @xcite .",
    "that is very promising for the realization of the resonant thz detection  @xcite and also of plasma instabilities , which can be utilized for the emission . in addition , interband population inversion in the thz range was predicted  @xcite , and it has been investigated for the utilization not only in thz lasers in the usual sense but also in thz active plasmonic devices  @xcite and metamaterials  @xcite .",
    "many experimental demonstrations of graphene - based devices have been performed on graphene samples with heavily - doped substrates , in order to tune the carrier concentration in graphene by the substrate as a back gate . typically , either peeling or cvd graphene transferred onto a heavily - doped p@xmath7-si substrate , with a sio@xmath8 dielectric layer in between , is used ( some experiments on graphene plasmons have adapted undoped si / sio@xmath8 substrates  @xcite ) .",
    "graphene - on - silicon , which is epitaxial graphene on doped si substrates  @xcite , is also used . for realization of thz plasmonic devices , properties of plasmons in such structures",
    "must be fully understood .",
    "although the coupling of graphene plasmons to surface plasmons in perfectly conducting metallic substrates with / without dielectric layers in between have been theoretically studied  @xcite , the influence of the carrier scattering in a heavily - doped semiconductor substrate ( with finite complex conductivity ) has not been taken into account so far . since the scattering rate in the substrate increases as the doping concentration increases , it is anticipated that the coupling of graphene plasmons to surface plasmons in the heavily - doped substrate causes undisired increase in the damping rate .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study theoretically the coupling between graphene plasmons and substrate surface plasmons in a structure with a heavily - doped substrate and with / without a metallic top gate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the sec .",
    "ii , we derive a dispersion equation of the coupled modes of graphene plasmons and substrate surface plasmons . in sec .",
    "iii , we study coupling effect in the ungated structure , especially the increase in the plasmon damping rate due to the coupling and its dependences on the doping concentration , the thickness of graphene - to - substrate separation , and the plasmon wavenumber . in sec .",
    "iv , we show that the coupling in the gated structures can be less effective due to the gate screening .",
    "we also compare the effect in structures having different dielectric layers between the top gate , graphene layer , and substrate , and reveal the impact of values of their dielectric constants . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss and summarize the main results of this paper .",

    "[ figschematics](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the thickness of the substrate is assumed to be sufficiently larger than the skin depth of the substrate surface plasmons .",
    "the top gate can be considered as perfectly conducting metal , whereas the heavily - doped si substrate is characterized by its complex dielectric constant .    here",
    ", we use the hydrodynamic equations to describe the electron motion in graphene  @xcite , while using the simple drude model for the hole motion in the substrate ( due to virtual independence of the effective mass in the substrate on the electron density , in contrast to graphene ) .",
    "in addition , these are accompanied by the self - consistent 2d poisson equation ( the formulation used here almost follows that for compound semiconductor high - electron - mobility transistors , see ref .  ) .",
    "differences are the hydrodynamic equations accounting for the linear dispersion of graphene and material parameters of the substrate and dielectric layers . in general , the existence of both electrons and holes in graphene results in various modes such as electrically passive electron - hole sound waves in intrinsic graphene as well as in huge damping of electrically active modes due to the electron - hole friction , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "here , we focus on the case where the electron concentration is much higher than the hole concentration and therefore the damping associated with the friction can be negligibly small . besides , for the generalization purpose , we formulate the plasmon dispersion equation for the gated structure ; that for the ungated structure can be readily found by taking the limit @xmath9 ( see fig .

    "the dependence of the collision frequency , @xmath31 , on the doping concentration , @xmath29 , is calculated from the experimental data for the hole mobility at room temperature in ref .  .",

    "qualitatively , eq .  ( [ eqac ] ) indicates that the coupling occurs unless @xmath47 or @xmath48 , i.e. , unless the separation of the graphene channel and the substrate is sufficiently large or the gate screening of graphene plasmons is effective .",

    "[ figdampgated-2ddep - sio2 ] ) unlike the case of the ungated structure , where the resonant peak decreases monotonically as increasing the wavenumber .",
    "this can be explained by the screening effect of the substrate against that of the top gate .",
    "when the wavenumber is small and the doping concentration corresponding to the resonance is low , the field created by the channel mode is mainly screened by the gate and the field is weakly spread into the bottom direction . as the doping concentration increases ( with increase in the wavevector which gives the resonance ) , the substrate begins to act as a back gate and the field spreads more into the bottom dielectric layer , so that the coupling effect becomes stronger .",
    "when the wavenumber becomes so large that @xmath91 does not hold , the field spread is no longer governed dominantly by the substrate or gate screening , i.e. , the channel mode begins to be `` ungated '' by the substrate .",
    "eventually , the coupling effect on the damping rate again becomes weak , with the decay of the field being proportional to @xmath96 .",
    "as illustrated in eq .",
    "( [ eqfirstfactor ] ) , the coupling effect in the gated strcture is characterized by the factor @xmath94 when the conditions @xmath91 and @xmath92 are met .",
    "this means that not only the thicknesses of the dielectric layers but also their dielectric constants are very important parameters to determine the coupling strength .",
    "for example , if we adapt the high - k material , e.g. , hfo@xmath8 in the top dielectric layer , it results in the more effective gate screening than in the gated structure with the al@xmath8o@xmath82 top dielectric layer , so that the coupling effect can be suppressed even with the same layer thicknesses .",
    "the structure with the dlc top and 3c - sic bottom dielectric layers ( with @xmath97  @xcite and @xmath98 ) corresponds to the quite opposite situation , where the gate screening becomes weak and the substrate screening becomes more effective , so that stronger coupling effect is anticipated .",

    "the damping rate as well as the frequency are more influenced by the coupling effect in the entire ranges of the doping concentration and wavevector .",
    "in particular , the increase in the damping rate with high doping concentration @xmath99 @xmath1 and the thickness of the bottom layer @xmath100 nm , which are typical values in real graphene samples , is much larger .",

    "the dependences of the damping rate on the doping concentration , the thickness of the bottom dielectric layer , and the plasmon wavenumber are associated with the field spread of the channel mode into the bottom dielectric layer and into the substrate .",
    "we revealed that even with very high doping concentration ( @xmath0 @xmath4 ) , away from the resonance , the coupling effect causes nonnegligible increase in the damping rate compared with the acoustic - phonon - limited damping rate . in the gated graphene structure ,",

    "<S> coupling of plasmons in graphene at terahertz ( thz ) frequencies with surface plasmons in a heavily - doped substrate is studied theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal that a huge scattering rate may completely damp out the plasmons , so that proper choices of material and geometrical parameters are essential to suppress the coupling effect and to obtain the minimum damping rate in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> even with the doping concentration @xmath0 @xmath1 and the thickness of the dielectric layer between graphene and the substrate @xmath2 nm , which are typical values in real graphene samples with a heavily - doped substrate , the increase in the damping rate is not negligible in comparison with the acoustic - phonon - limited damping rate . </S>",
    "<S> dependence of the damping rate on wavenumber , thicknesses of graphene - to - substrate and gate - to - graphene separation , substrate doping concentration , and dielectric constants of surrounding materials are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the damping rate can be much reduced by the gate screening , which suppresses the field spread of the graphene plasmons into the substrate . </S>"
