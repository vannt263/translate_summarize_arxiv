    "braneworld models are best described by scalar - tensor theories @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "the gravitational couplings become functions of the moduli and standard gr predictions get modified in ways that can be tightly constrained by present astrophysical observations .",

    "we show that solar - system and binary - pulsar tests can be used to discriminate between different 5d braneworld models and to shed light on their extra - dimensional configuration . for this , we have chosen a rather general setup , bps - braneworlds , of which the randall - sundrum model @xcite and dilatonic braneworlds @xcite are just particular examples .",
