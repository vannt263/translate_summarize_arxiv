    "recently the study of quark gluon plasma(qgp ) , expected to be created in heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies , intrigues the scientific community with its multifarious interesting aspects .",
    "therefore , in order to understand different properties of qgp we need to probe it . among many , one of the efficient probes is the charm quark ( cq ) produced in the early hard collisions of the partons from the colliding nuclei .",
    "generally the transport coefficients are sensitive to the interaction of the probes with the medium .",
    "hence , estimation of the various transport coefficients of qgp by using cq is a field of high contemporary interest .",
    "moreover , strong coupling of the probes with the medium may bring the probe in equilibrium with the bulk matter , so that the probe follow a momentum distribution similar to that of the constituents of the medium .",
    "in the present work , we will consider the qgp as the thermal medium of light quarks , their antiparticles and gluons and the cqs as probes .",
    "this will enable us to estimate the drag , diffusion and shear viscous coefficients of qgp and the nature of the equilibrium distribution of the cqs .",
    "the reasons behind choosing cq as a probe are : ( i ) being created from the early hard collisions , cq can experience the hot / dense medium from its birth .",
    "the cq distribution function is different from that of the medium particle and being heavier than the constituent particles of qgp , it does not get equilibrated quickly and hence it qualifies to act as the brownian particle .",
    "( ii ) the probability of the production of cq ( with mass m ) inside the thermal medium of temperature @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) is very less , hence , the probability of annihilation of cqs in the qgp is also small",
    ". therefore , the cqs witness the entire evolution of the bath . the probability of creation and annihilation of bottom quarks is even smaller , therefore , the present work can be extended to the bottom quarks also . while propagating through the qgp the cq interacts with the medium particle via two dominant processes : a)collisional or elastic interaction and b ) inelastic interaction like gluon bremsstrahlung . in earlier works , while calculating the momentum diffusion coefficients , either the gluon radiation by the cq have been ignored  @xcite or it is calculated for non - relativistic cq  @xcite or estimated by first determining the drag from radiative energy loss  @xcite and then using the einstein relation between drag and diffusion coefficients@xcite .    in this work , we calculate , using pqcd , the transverse and longitudinal diffusion coefficients of the cq undergoing radiative loss by emitting gluons while propelling through the qgp .",
    "we consider that the emitted gluons , being soft , get absorbed in the medium , thereby resulting in transporting the energy from the fast moving cq to the slow moving constituents of the bath .",
    "this transportation of momentum is reflected in the momentum diffusion coefficients of the cq in qgp .",
    "the values of the drag and diffusion coefficients can be used to characterize the distribution function of the probe .",
    "therefore , these transport coefficients can be utilized to understand the departure of the cq distribution from the thermal distribution of the bath particles .",
    "the shape of the equilibrium distribution function of cq have been studied using a generalized einstein relation derived in ref.@xcite .",
    "we revisit this relation by including both the collisional and the radiative transport coefficients of cq .    the present work is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discourse the formalism of fokker planck equation(fpe ) and the procedure to evaluate transport coefficients for collisional and radiative processes . in section iii , the equilibrium distribution(@xmath2 ) of cq",
    "is elaborated in the context of bremsstrahlung process .",
    "the impact of the radiative transport coefficients on the @xmath2 is particularly highlighted . in section iv , the @xmath3 of qgp has been estimated using cq transverse diffusion coefficients with particular emphasis on the radiative processes .",
    "section v is dedicated to summary and conclusions .",
    "heavy quark propagates as a brownian particle in the qgp medium . the ensemble of brownian particles immersed in the thermal medium can be characterized by the single particle distribution function , @xmath4 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath5 is governed by the master equation , a simplified version of which is the fokker planck equation(fpe ) .",
    "the form of the master equation or the boltzmann transport equation(bte ) governing the cq distribution @xmath5 is given by : f(,,t)=_collisions in the absence of external force , @xmath6 and for a homogeneous plasma , we can write bte as follows : _ collisions= d^3[w(+ , ) f(+)-w(,)f ( ) ] .",
    "[ bte ] where @xmath7 is the rate of collision of cq changing its momentum from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . considering only the soft scattering of cq with the bath particles ,",

    "our motivation is to find out these coefficients due to the elastic and inelastic interactions of the cqs with the bath particle within the ambit of pqcd .",
    "first , we concentrate on the two - body elastic processes .",
    "while propagating inside the plasma , the cq(q ) encounters the following interactions with the bath particle : q(@xmath12)+g(@xmath13)@xmath14q(@xmath15)+g(@xmath16 ) , q(@xmath12)+q(@xmath13)@xmath17 q(@xmath15)+q(@xmath16 ) and q(@xmath12)+@xmath18)@xmath17 q(@xmath15)+@xmath19 ) , where the quantities within the bracket denote momenta of the cq , quark ( q ) , antiquark ( @xmath20 ) and gluon ( g ) .",
