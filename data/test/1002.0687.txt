    "the ultimate goal of nanotechnology is control over molecular - scale mechanical and electronic components .",
    "an oft - proposed route to this goal is the construction of components from controllable single molecules .",
    "an important class of such molecules with obvious applications is formed by those that have properties that are reversibly and bi - stably modifiable by external stimuli  so - called _",
    "molecular switches_. one example is the azobenzene molecule ( h@xmath2c@xmath3-n@xmath4n - c@xmath3h@xmath2 ) , which can be bi - stably photo - isomerized between its planar , @xmath5 symmetric _ trans _ and torsioned - twisted , @xmath6 _ cis _ conformers in both solution and gas - phase .",
    "the high yield and stability of this reaction have rendered azobenzene an archetype of molecular switch research with proposed technical applications including e.g.  light - driven actuators@xcite and information storage media@xcite .",
    "perspective views of _ trans _ and _ cis _ azobenzene and tba , together with an illustration of the diazo - bridge bond length @xmath7 and the dihedral cnnc angle @xmath8 .",
    "the latter is defined as the smallest angle between two planes spanned by the @xmath1 bridge and @xmath9c@xmath9n@xmath9 and @xmath9n@xmath9c@xmath9 bonds to the first and second phenyl - ring , respectively .",
    "the c atoms of the phenyl - rings have been darkened to allow easier distinction of azobenzene backbone and functional butyl groups in tba . ]    for many such applications , switching of molecules at solid interfaces ",
    "adsorbed at metal surfaces , for example  is of particular interest .",
    "unfortunately however , the switching properties of azobenzene have proven highly sensitive to the adsorbate - substrate interaction : even at nearly chemically inert close - packed noble metal surfaces , switching of surface - adsorbed azobenzene by light has never been achieved , and switching by excitation with a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) tip has been successful only at au(111)@xcite . a natural route to restoring the adsorbate switching ability is to further decouple the frontier @xmath10 and @xmath11 orbitals responsible@xcite for the gas- or liquid phase photo - isomerization from the substrate electronic structure . with these frontier orbitals largely located at the central diazo ( @xmath9n = n@xmath9 ) bridge an intuitive idea to achieve such",
    "a decoupling is to functionalize the molecule with bulky spacer groups that prevent a closer encounter of the photochemically active unit with the substrate .",
    "this is precisely the notion behind the arguably to date most studied such adsorbate , @xmath0-tetra-_tert_-butyl - azobenzene ( tba ) @xcite .",
    "tba consists of azobenzene functionalized with four _ tert_-butyl ( -c-(ch@xmath12)@xmath12 ) groups in the phenyl - ring meta positions as illustrated in fig .",
    "these table legs were indeed found to enhance the switching efficiency of the adsorbed species , as e.g. indicated by the successful tba switching by light at au(111 ) @xcite .",
    "however , attempts at stm - tip induced switching at ostensibly comparable substrates such as ag(111)@xcite and au(100)@xcite have been unsuccessful , indicating that tba is not significantly more robust to specifics of the substrate interaction than pure azobenzene .",
    "these circumstances beg the question , how and to what degree the tba butyl groups really decouple the photochromic moiety from the substrate . for a corresponding atomic - scale understanding the detailed characterization of the adsorbate geometry and binding",
    "constitutes a prerequisite and is the main objective of the present contribution . in contemporary surface science ,",
    "corresponding analyses are increasingly performed by quantitative first - principles electronic structure calculations . particularly density - functional theory ( dft ) with present - day local or semi - local exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals has developed into an unparalleled workhorse for this task , with often surprising accuracy particularly with respect to structural properties of the surface adsorption system .",
    "for tba at au(111 ) corresponding calculations are already challenged by the extension of the functionalized molecule and the simultaneous necessity to describe the metal band structure within a periodic supercell approach . on a more fundamental level ,",
    "the real limitation comes nevertheless from sizable dispersive van der waals ( vdw ) contributions to the surface chemical bond as characteristic for organic molecules containing highly polarizable aromatic ring systems @xcite . with local and semi - local xc functionals",
    "inherently unable to account for such contributions @xcite skewed , if not qualitatively wrong results must therefore be suspected .",
    "we have recently quantified this for azobenzene at the close - packed coinage metal surfaces @xcite .",
    "comparison to detailed structural and energetic reference data from normal - incidence x - ray standing wave ( ni - xsw ) and temperature programmed desorption ( tpd ) measurements for azobenzene at ag(111 ) demonstrates that the prevalent semi - local dft xc treatment leads indeed to a significant underbinding with key structural parameters deviating by more than 0.5 @xcite .    for system sizes as those implied by the adsorption of azobenzene or tba an appealing and computationally tractable possibility to improve on this situation",
    "is a semi - empirical account of dispersive interactions within the framework of so - called dft - d schemes @xcite . in this approach",
    "the vdw interactions not described by present - day xc functionals are approximately considered by adding a pairwise interatomic @xmath13 term to the dft energy . at distances below a cut - off , motivated by the vdw radii of the atom pair , this long - range dispersion contribution",
    "is heuristically reduced to zero by multiplication with a short - range damping function . while the applicability of this approach to adsorption at metal surfaces is uncertain ( _ vide infra _ ) , our recent benchmark study for azobenzene at ag(111 ) revealed that in particular the most recent dft - d scheme due to tkatchenko and scheffler ( ts ) @xcite yields excellent structural properties , albeit at a notable overbinding @xcite .    in this contribution we further explore the generality of this finding by analyzing the adsorption geometry , vibrations and energetics of tba at au(111 ) .",
    "comparison against our recent near edge x - ray absorption fine structure ( nexafs ) @xcite and high - resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ( hreels ) @xcite measurements , as well as a complete analysis of new tpd data confirms the accurate structural and vibrational predictions reached by the dft - d ts scheme .",
    "the again obtained significant overbinding furthermore supports the interpretation @xcite that the neglect of metallic screening is the main limitation in the application of this scheme to the adsorption of organic molecules at metal surfaces . comparing the tba data to those for pure azobenzene at au(111 )",
    "we find a qualitatively different adsorption geometry for the functional backbone in the case of the _ cis _ isomer .",
    "for the _ trans _ isomer , on the other hand , we determine an intriguing structural and vibrational insensitivity of the photochemically active central diazo - bridge to the presence of the bulky spacer groups .",
    "the role of the latter for the switching efficiency is therefore more subtle than simple geometric decoupling and will be the topic of continuing work in our groups .",
    "the dft - d methodology followed in this work corresponds exactly to that employed in our preceding work for the adsorption of azobenzene .",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves here to a brief account and refer to our previous publications @xcite for an in - depth description of the underlying concepts and technical details .",
    "the dft calculations were performed using a plane - wave basis set and library ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite as implemented in and distributed with the castep@xcite code . the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to the xc - functional with the parametrization suggested by perdew , burke and ernzerhof@xcite ( pbe ) was used throughout . in the spirit of the dft - d approach ,",
    "the lack of vdw interactions in this semi - local functional is approximately corrected with an additional analytical , two - body inter - atomic potential . at long range , this potential equals the leading @xmath14-term of the london series , where @xmath15 is the inter - atomic distance , and @xmath16 a so - called dispersion coefficient . at short range , this long range potential is matched to the dft inter - atomic potential by a damping function @xmath17 , typically modulated by the vdw radii @xmath18 of the atom pair . in this work we use the material - specific @xmath16 and @xmath18 parameters , as well as",
    "the damping function form suggested by tkatchenko and scheffler @xcite ( henceforth denominating corresponding results as pbe+ts ) .",
    "this scheme accounts to some degree for the bonding environment through a hirshfeld - analysis based adjustment of the @xmath19 parameters , which in our previous work on azobenzene at coinage metal surface gave a superior performance compared to other dft - d schemes @xcite .",
    "the analytical form of the dispersion correction potential brings the advantage that dispersion - corrected total energies of geometries that are fully relaxed with respect to the dispersion - corrected forces can be obtained ( employing an in - house extension to the castep code ) at essentially the same computational cost as a regular gga calculation . on the other hand",
    "the assumption of a simple two - body form for the dispersion potential inherently neglects the effect of electronic screening of the vdw interactions@xcite , which particularly for the here studied adsorption at metal surfaces is expected to lead to an overestimation of the binding energy @xcite . a second limitation of the semi - empirical dft - d approach might arise for adsorbate molecules which also interact covalently with the substrate .",
    "this typically leads to molecule - substrate bond distances that are so short that the uncertainties in the heuristic damping function of the dispersion term may mingle in an uncontrolled way with deficiencies of the employed semi - local dft xc functional .",
    "the surface calculations were performed within supercells , using ( 111)-oriented metal slabs with @xmath20 surface unit - cells and at least 18 vacuum .",
    "we verified that lateral interactions between adsorbed tba and its periodic images are negligble at the gga - pbe level . in the dispersion correction",
    "potential corresponding interactions were also switched off , so that our calculations should give a fair account of tba adsorption in the low - coverage limit . as in our preceding work we neglected the subtle effects of the long - range au(111 ) surface reconstruction .",
    "full geometry optimizations ( to within residual forces below 30 mev /  ) of all molecular degrees of freedom were correspondingly performed with tba adsorbed on one side of a four layer bulk - truncated slab .",
    "test calculations with appropriately saturated _",
    "tert_-butyl groups indicated only a weakly expressed site specificity of these tba functional groups at au(111 ) .",
    "this suggests that the photochemically active diazo - bridge plays a prominent role in anchoring the molecule at the metal substrate .",
    "the geometry optimizations were correspondingly initiated with the tba diazo - bridge laterally placed as in the previously determined optimal adsorption geometry of azobenzene , corresponding to a 1:1 n - metal atom coordination @xcite .",
    "harmonic vibrational spectra of the adsorbed species in these relaxed geometries ( and in the gas - phase ) were subsequently obtained from numerical hessians calculated by finite differences and neglecting any degrees of freedom of substrate atoms . to efficiently parallelize over the 432 displacements required for each spectrum , we have interfaced with the atomistic simulation environment including the phonopy extension to it @xcite .",
    "not aiming to reproduce the hreels intensities @xcite , simple lorentzian broadening with a width of 1 mev was applied to the spectra for better visualization .    for the energetic and electronic structure calculations the thus determined relaxed adsorbate geometries were inverted in the bottom layer , forming inversion - symmetric seven layer slabs with adsorbates at both sides .",
    "this zeroes the internal dipole moment of the slab and results in a substantially improved substrate electronic structure .",
    "the two central energetic quantities obtained with the resulting structures are the adsorption energy @xmath21-e_{{\\rm azo(gas ) } } \\quad , \\label{eq : e_ads}\\ ] ] and the relative stability of adsorbed _ cis _ ( c ) and _ trans _ ( t ) conformer @xmath22 \\quad .",

    "both quantities were also consistently zero - point energy corrected with the previously obtained vibrational frequencies . in the convention of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_ads ] ) the adsorption energy of either _ cis _ or _ trans _ isomer at the surface is thus measured relative to its stability in the gas - phase at both pure pbe and dispersion corrected pbe+ts levels of theory , and a negative sign indicates that adsorption is exothermic .",
    "consistently , a negative sign of @xmath29 indicates a higher stability of the _ cis _ isomer .",
    "convergence tests show that at the employed plane wave cutoff of 450ev and @xmath30 monkhorst - pack ( mp ) grid@xcite both energetic quantities are numerically converged to within @xmath31mev .",
    "the tpd measurements were carried out under ultrahigh vacuum conditions .",
    "the au(111 ) crystal was mounted on a liquid nitrogen cooled cryostat , which in conjunction with resistive heating enables temperature control from 90k to 750k .",
    "the crystal was cleaned by a standard procedure of ar@xmath32 sputtering and annealing .",
    "the tba was dosed by means of a home - built effusion cell held at 380k at a crystal temperature of 260k . in the tpd experiments",
    ", the substrate was resistively heated with a linear heating rate of 1 k / s and desorbing tba was detected with a quadrupole mass spectrometer at the tba - fragment mass of 190 amu ( 3,5-di-_tert_-butyl - phenyl ion ) .",
    "this procedure was repeated for different dosing times corresponding to different initial tba - coverages .    as further discussed below , three desorption features ( @xmath33@xmath34 )",
    "are observed in the tpd .",
    "they are assigned to desorption from the multilayer ( @xmath33 ) and the first monolayer ( ml ) ( @xmath35 + @xmath34 ) , where @xmath35 represents the desorption of @xmath36 10% of the monolayer coverage ( for details see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and ref .  ) .",
    "the nexafs and hreels measurements of refs . discussed in section iii were performed at a coverage of 1.0 and 0.9ml , respectively , which were prepared by heating the multilayer - covered surface to 340k or to 420k .",
    "side view of adsorbed _ cis _ tba at au(111 ) , illustrating key structural parameters defining the adsorption geometry ( see text ) : the vertical height @xmath37 of the two diazo - bridge n atoms , as well as the out - of - horizontal phenyl plane bend angles @xmath38 . ]",
    "our previous work on azobenzene at coinage metal surfaces points to an understanding of the surface chemical bond in terms of a balance of four major contributions : a covalent bond between the diazo - bridge and the metal , the vdw attraction between the metal and the phenyl - rings , the pauli repulsion between the phenyl - rings and the metal , and the energetic penalty due to the distortion of the gas - phase molecular geometry @xcite . this understanding should largely carry over to tba at au(111 ) , with the bulky tert - butyl groups particularly adding to the vdw attraction and the molecular deformation upon adsorption .",
    "key structural parameters to characterize the adsorption geometry for both _ trans _ and _ cis _ isomer are therefore the location and orientation of the central diazo - bridge , as well as the orientation of the planes of the two phenyl - rings with respect to the surface . as further illustrated in figs .",

    "obviously , @xmath43 reflects an diazo - bridge that is oriented parallel to the surface , as we obtain for the more symmetric _ trans _ isomer throughout . to specify the position of the phenyl - rings we focus on the cnnc dihedral angle @xmath8 and the out - of - horizontal bend angles @xmath44 of the two ohenyl planes , with the same convention for the index @xmath45 to distinguish the closer and more distant phenyl - ring in the asymmetric adsorption geometry of .",
    "[ fig2 ] . adapting to the convention employed in refs . and",
    ", a dihedral angle of @xmath46 indicates a planar tba molecule , while @xmath47 denotes a phenyl - ring that lies parallel to the surface plane .",

    "assuming no additional activation barrier for adsorption , this then provides the aspired benchmark number against which the calculated @xmath50 for _ trans _ tba may be referenced .",
    "as apparent from table [ table2 ] the values obtained at the pbe and pbe+ts level are very consistent with the findings of the previous studies of benzene and pure azobenzene at coinage metal surfaces @xcite : the lack of vdw interactions in the semi - local pbe functional leads to an overall negligible binding of both tba isomers , with the actual values for @xmath50 in fact essentially identical to those computed for pure azobenzene at au(111 ) before @xcite .",
    "adding dispersive attraction within the dft - d approach these binding energies are dramatically increased , such that in the end the intended dispersion correction amounts to more than 90% of the total binding energy .",
    "compared to the experimental reference the pbe+ts approach overbinds the _ trans _ isomer by about as much as pbe underbinds . in absolute numbers",
    "this is a disconcerting deviation of more than 1ev . in our previous work",
    "we had assigned the corresponding overbinding determined for pure azobenzene to the neglect of metallic screening in the dft - d approach@xcite .",
    "this argument was largely based on the intriguing accuracy of the pbe+ts adsorption geometry compared to the bond distances derived from ni - xsw measurements . as discussed above , such a conclusion on the determined tba adsorption geometry",
    "is presently not possible , as all hitherto measured structural parameters are not very sensitive to the additional vdw attraction provided by the pbe+ts scheme .",
    "on the other hand , the additional butyl groups lead to a significantly increased overall binding energy of tba compared to azobenzene , and in both cases pbe+ts overbinds by roughly 40% ( azo : 1.71ev vs. 1.08ev @xcite ; tba : 3.00ev vs. 1.70ev ) .",
    "such a rather geometry - unspecific deviation between theoretical and experimental data quite well fits the anticipated effect of an overestimated uniform background potential .",
    "the latter is attributed to the neglect of screening of vdw contributions from more distant substrate atoms .    for gas - phase tba pbe+ts yields a somewhat smaller _",
    "cis_-_trans _ energy difference @xmath51 than for pure azobenzene , 0.29ev compared to 0.49ev@xcite , respectively .",
    "this arises predominantly from the additional vdw attractions due to the butyl groups in the bend _",
    "conformer , cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and is not found at the pbe level of theory , where @xmath52ev for both tba and azobenzene . compared to the gas - phase reference , the stability difference of the two tba conformers is with 0.99ev substantially increased at au(111 ) at pbe+ts level of theory .",
    "this is primarily due to the larger vdw attraction possible in the planar _",
    "trans _ adsorption mode and was equivalently obtained for pure azobenzene adsorption @xcite . this interpretation in terms of vdw is corroborated by the essentially unchanged @xmath29 of gas - phase and adsorbed tba at pbe level of theory , where these bonding contributions are absent , cf . table [ table2 ] . not withstanding , in light of the suspected overestimation of the vdw attraction within pbe+ts",
    "we also expect that this increase of @xmath29 upon adsorption is overestimated . extrapolating the roughly 40% overshoot seen in the _ trans _ tba binding energy",
    ", we would therefore cautiously conclude on only a moderate @xmath53ev increase of the _ cis_-_trans _ energy difference upon adsorption of tba at au(111 ) . while the therewith implied higher stability of adsorbed _ trans _ tba is consistent with the existing experimental data , there are to date unfortunately no dedicated measurements of @xmath29 against which this estimate could be compared .",
    "the picture arising from the geometric and energetic characterization of tba at au(111 ) points to a surface chemical bond that is predominantly due to unspecific dispersive interactions . particularly for the _ trans _ conformer , the structural similarity of the azobenzene and tba adsorption complex with respect to the photochemically active diazo - bridge moiety ( together with the in both cases negligible @xmath9n = n@xmath9 bond activation ) questions the oft - quoted function of the tert - butyl spacers in terms of a geometric decoupling from the surface .",
    "complementary information confirming this view can come from an analysis of the surface vibrational modes .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] compares corresponding results computed for _ trans _ tba at au(111 ) at pbe+ts level of theory with experimental data from hreels @xcite . at first glance ,",
    "we find overall agreement with all major features nicely reproduced by the calculations .",
    "as had already been noticed in the experimental work , the vibrational spectrum exhibits only minor changes between adsorbed _ cis _ and _ trans _ tba and even tba in the condensed phase @xcite .",
    "this is similarly obtained in the calculations , as illustrated by the spectrum for _ cis _ tba at au(111 ) also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "the detailed inspection of the c - h vibrational modes in the energy range of 350 to 400  mev reveals nevertheless the subtle influence of the au(111 ) substrate on the vibrational spectra of the adsorbed species .",
    "based on the calculations the three frequency bands centered at 368 , 378 , and 390mev are assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric c - h vibrations of the tert - butyl groups , as well as the c - h bending modes at the phenyl - rings , respectively .",
    "there is a clear change of the former two vibrational bands when going from the pbe to the pbe+ts description , cf .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "the overall reduced distance of the tba molecule to the gold substrate upon inclusion of the attractive vdw forces leads to a clear splitting of the c - h vibrations of the _ tert_-butyl moieties . in the adsorbed species the frequencies of the c - h bonds pointing towards the substrate",
    "are red shifted by 5 - 10mev and the corresponding vibrations develop low - energy sidebands .",
    "these subtle but important changes are confirmed by the experimental hreels spectra . due to the mainly in - plane character of the c - h phenyl - ring bending modes we observe only a small shoulder at 390mev .",
    "in contrast the symmetric and asymmetric c - h stretch vibrations of the _ tert_-butyl legs at 368 and 380mev result in pronounced dipole - active bands . upon _",
    "trans _ to _ cis _ isomerization the number of c - h bonds pointing towards and noticeably contacting the substrate is roughly halved , cf .",
    "this leads in both experiment and theory to a reduction of the low - energy side bands best seen for the symmetric c - h stretch vibrations which constitute the lowest band at 368mev . as the splitting of the c - h stretch vibrations happens only at a reduced distance to the substrate ( pbe vs. pbe+ts adsorption structure ) it confirms the importance of vdw interaction in the bonding of tba .",
    "unfortunately this is not a quantitative benchmark for the accuracy of our semi - empirical pbe+ts approach .",
    "more insight into the specific bonding of the diazo - bridge moiety can specifically come from a detailed analysis of the @xmath9n = n@xmath9 stretch mode",
    ". however , identically obtained with pbe and pbe+ts , the computed value of 184mev in adsorbed _ trans _ and _ cis _ tba again reflects a negligible activation of the nn bond at the surface . compared to the respective gas - phase values , the mode red - shifts only by about 3mev for both isomers . correspondingly , the obtained shift between this stretch mode in _ trans _ and _ cis _ tba at au(111 ) is very similar to the one computed for free tba , 6 vs. 5 mev , respectively .",
    "this in turn compares very well to the 8mev measured for tba in the condensed phase with ir and raman spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "such a negligible change of the _ cis_-_trans _ stretch frequency difference upon adsorption is not found for pure azobenzene at au(111 ) . here",
    ", the closer encounter of the diazo - bridge in the _ cis _ adsorption geometry softens the stretch mode by more than 6 mev . with the mode unaffected in adsorbed",
    "azobenzene , this leads to a concomitant increase of the _",
    "cis_-_trans _ stretch frequency shift compared to the gas - phase . in _",
    "tba at au(111 ) a corresponding softening does not occur as the diazo - bridge does not come as close to the surface in the skewed adsorption mode . in this respect",
    ", one can really attest some geometric decoupling effect to the butyl groups , yet only for the _ cis _ isomer .",
    "for the _ trans _ isomer though , an equivalent analysis of the diazo - bridge against surface stretch or other torsional azo modes shows always the same similarity between tba and azobenzene at au(111 ) as for the just discussed @xmath9n = n@xmath9 stretch mode",
    ". also the characterization of the surface vibrational properties supports therefore the understanding that the effect of the bulky _",
    "tert_-butyl groups for the switching properties of _ trans _ tba at au(111 ) must be more subtle than a mere geometric decoupling of the central photochemically active molecular moiety .",
    "a methodological motivation of this work was to further explore the capabilities of the semi - empirical dispersion correction approach to semi - local dft in describing the adsorption of complex organic molecules at metal surfaces .",
    "for this we have presented a detailed characterization of the geometric , energetic and vibrational properties of the _ trans _ and _ cis _ isomers of the azobenzene derivate tba at au(111 ) .",
    "the findings are in all respects in line with the experience from preceding studies on benzene and pure azobenzene at coinage metal surfaces @xcite : the additional account of attractive vdw interaction introduced by the pbe+ts scheme leads to a significant modification of the adsorption geometry , primarily in terms of bringing the molecule closer to the surface .",
    "the concomitantly dramatically increased binding energy is notably overestimated compared to the reference value from tpd measurements . for azobenzene at ag(111 ) a corresponding overbinding  in fact in relative terms very much comparable to the one found here for tba at au(111 )  was attributed to the neglect of metallic screening of dispersive interactions in the semi - empirical dft - d approach @xcite .",
    "this argument was largely based on the very accurate pbe+ts adsorption geometry as compared to detailed structural data from ni - xsw measurements .",
    "such a conclusion is , unfortunately , not yet possible in full for the here studied tba at au(111 ) .",
    "the qualitative features of the determined _ trans _ and _ cis _ adsorption geometries and even detailed tilt and inclination angles agree all very well with existing data from stm @xcite , hreels @xcite and nexafs @xcite experiments .",
    "the energetic lowering of the c - h stretch vibrations of the _",
    "tert_-butyl groups pointing towards the substrate is only observed in the pbe+ts approach .",
    "this points towards the importance of the vdw component introduced by the dft - d approach . however , no experimental reference data exist to date for the vertical height of the adsorbed molecule , that would allow to directly confirm the present working hypothesis , namely that the pbe+ts approach is a very useful and computationally tractable tool to provide accurate structural information for adsorbed complex organic molecules .",
    "if this working hypothesis proves correct and the determined pbe+ts adsorption geometries are indeed accurate , the prevailing preconception of the role of the bulky functional groups for the experimentally observed improved isomerization ability of adsorbed tba needs revision .",
    "motivated by the gas - phase structure , this view discusses the butyl groups as spacers that help to decouple the molecular switch from the metal substrate . for the tba _ cis _ isomer",
    "we indeed compute a skewed adsorption mode , in which one phenyl - moiety is much more tilted , up to the point of standing essentially perpendicular to the surface plane .",
    "this is quite different to the more symmetric adsorption mode of _ cis _ azobenzene at au(111 ) , such that here one can attest some geometric decoupling from the surface due to the butyl table legs. quite distinctly , the almost planar adsorption mode of _ trans _ tba is very much comparable to the adsorption geometry of pure azobenzene . particularly for the photochemically active diazo - bridge moiety this similarity goes even down to essentially unchanged structural and vibrational properties . in this respect ,",
    "a core message arising from the present study is that especially for the photo - switching of _ trans _ tba the effect of the bulky spacer groups must be more subtle than the anticipated mere geometric decoupling of the functional backbone from the metal surface .",
