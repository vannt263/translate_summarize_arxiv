    "the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite plays a crucial role in our understanding of quantum field theory . despite its non - renormalizability in 3 + 1 dimensions , the njl model has already found many applications in nuclear and high energy physics @xcite .",
    "the 2 + 1 dimensional njl model has also been studied in the large @xmath0 limit @xcite .",
    "this model is know to be non - renormalizable when expanded in the four - fermi coupling . nevertheless , it is renormalizable in the @xmath1 perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the effective potential of this model has been studied at zero temperature up to the next to leading order in @xmath1 by carrying out the hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite . when the fluctuations of the composite scalars are included",
    "the effective potential develops an imaginary part . at finite temperature",
    "this complicates the analysis of the symmetry breaking and restoration .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effective potential to the next to leading order in the large @xmath0 expansion for the three - dimensional model at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "the problem of obtaining the effective potential is an old one .",
    "there exist well developed general methods for constructing effective potentials for elementary @xcite as well as for composite fields @xcite ( see also @xcite where a finite temperature version of the latter is discussed ) .",
    "these methods , however , can not be applied to some specific models in a straightforward manner .",
    "for example , should one try to construct the effective potential for a scalar theory with a double - well tree level potential , he would find at the leading order an imaginary contribution @xcite .",
    "the latter is due to a tachionic vacuum at an intermediate stage in the calculations . in the scalar @xmath2 theory , a method for dealing with this obstacle",
    "was found long ago @xcite .",
    "the way around the problem was the introduction of an additional scalar field .",
    "while studying the njl model , one usually introduces some auxiliary scalar fields that could be interpreted as composites built from fermions @xcite . in terms of these new fields ,",
    "the problem of constructing the effective potential is very much the same as in pure scalar theories except that the propagators of the composite particles are much more complicated @xcite .",
    "the leading order effective potential in the njl model , which plays the same role as a tree level potential in scalar theories , may also be double - well in shape .",
    "in fact , this happens as soon as the four - fermi coupling constant becomes larger than some critical value .",
    "then , an attempt to go beyond the leading order inevitably results in an imaginary contribution to the effective potential due to the same reasons as in the pure scalar case @xcite .    often there is no reason to doubt the leading order result ,",
    "so this lack of a straightforward method for calculating the next to leading order corrections may seem to be of no interest .",
    "there are , however , several instances when the knowledge of the next to leading order terms becomes of prime importance .",
    "this happens , for example , when one studies the finite temperature 2 + 1 dimensional njl model which enjoys a continuous global symmetry .",
    "the leading order calculation of the effective potential indicates that the symmetry remains broken for a range of non - zero temperatures .",
    "this result seem to contradict the predictions of the mermin - wagner - coleman ( mwc ) theorem @xcite . the argument is well known . the infrared region of the system is dominated by the zero matsubara modes of the boson fields .",
    "the latter effectively live in a 1 + 1 dimensional space .",
    "thus , by appealing to the above mentioned theorem , one concludes that the symmetry breaking is forbidden @xcite .",
    "we find it surprising that there are no explicit calculations of the next to leading order effective potential at finite temperature in the njl model in 2 + 1 dimensions to demonstrate that the symmetry is restored for an arbitrarily small @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we perform such calculations and show that the global minimum of the potential does indeed occur at the origin or , in other words , that the symmetry is not broken at any finite temperature .",
    "the fluctuations of the composite scalar particle , which is the ng boson at @xmath4 , play a crucial role in the symmetry restoration .    in some recent studies the finite temperature condensate @xcite and the equation of state @xcite of njl models",
    "have been computed to the next to leading order in @xmath1 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the problem of the imaginary contributions was appreciated in @xcite .",
    "there it was noticed that the effective potential of the njl model ( with a non - zero bare mass for fermions ) is real at the minimum field configuration .",
    "this is similar to the result obtained by dolan and jackiw for theories with fundamental scalar fields @xcite .",
    "even though the effective potential is real at the minimum , the problem still exists in general . in this paper",
    "we suggest a method that resolves the imaginary part problem in the njl model in 2 + 1 dimensions at finite temperature ( and even outside the minimum of the potential ) .",
    "its generalization may also work in the 3 + 1 dimensional case at finite temperature .",
    "finally , it seems that there is no clear understanding of what happens in the 2 + 1 dimensional njl model as the temperature approaches zero .",
    "since the mwc theorem is believed to work for arbitrarily small temperatures , there is no symmetry breaking for any non - zero t. at t=0 , the continuous symmetry is broken .",
    "then , a natural question arises .",
    "how does the effective potential in the model behave as the temperature approaches zero ?",
    "we answer this question below .",
    "let us start with the analysis of the njl model in 3-dimensional euclidean space at zero temperature . to apply the large @xmath0 expansion scheme , we consider the model containing @xmath0 identical flavors .",

    "( [ njlt=0 ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that the integrated in boson fields are also involved in symmetry transformations .    after integrating out the fermions ,",

    "\\label{kint=0}\\ ] ] the straightforward calculation of the infrared asymptotic behavior of the boson propagators reveals the following expressions for the kinetic coefficients @xcite @xmath17 instead of using these infrared asymptotes , we replace them with constant coefficients and argue that this would give a reasonable approximation in the whole range of momenta .",
    "the reasoning goes as follows .",
    "the composite particles in the far infrared region ( large distances ) should presumably behave as almost point - like objects .",
    "their kinetic coefficients would be given by the expressions as in eq .",
    "( [ at=0 ] ) with a specific value of @xmath18 . as for the ultraviolet region",
    ", it is known that the leading asymptotic behavior does not depend on @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath20 s independent of @xmath19 as a much better approximation than that in eq .",
    "( [ at=0 ] ) .",
    "later , when we match the zero and the finite temperature results , we will see that there is another advantage to the above approximation .",
    "following the standard analysis applied for scalar theories @xcite , we introduce an additional auxiliary scalar field @xmath21 into our bosonic action , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the characteristic scale of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "below we assume that @xmath24 .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the model at hand is renormalizable in the @xmath1 expansion . in spite of that",
    ", it is more convenient for us to use the bare quantities throughout the paper without performing renormalizations .",
    "that is sufficient for our purposes since we are only interested in analyzing the long distance behavior of the theory , which is captured quite well by a model with a large but finite physical cutoff .    in calculations",
    ", we have to keep all contributions up to the order @xmath25 .",
    "however , it will be more convenient to keep exact results as they appear after integrations , without continually performing the expansions .",
    "obviously , this will not affect any of our results since all the interesting features of the effective potential , as we shall see , occur at values of @xmath26 much smaller than the cutoff @xmath12 .    to construct the effective potential",

    "( [ effchit=0 ] ) , we finally obtain the effective potential as a function of @xmath26 alone .",

    "obviously , the straightforward extension of our calculations to the region @xmath45 would result in a non - zero imaginary part in the effective potential .",
    "such a situation looks rather disappointing .",
    "it has been claimed , though , that the maxwell construction has to be used for the region @xmath45 @xcite .",
