    "recent advances in the construction of low cost , low power , and mass produced micro sensors and micro - electro - mechanical ( mem ) systems have ushered in a new era in system design using distributed sensor networks @xcite .",
    "the advent of sensor network technology provides a variety of applications that have been considered unrealistic in the past .",
    "one such application is in the area of space communications : with ad hoc sensor networks , a number of sensor nodes randomly placed on a planet can collaboratively collect information and then , also collaboratively , send the information back to earth . in this scenario",
    ", the sensors must have an ability to transmit information over very long distances with high energy efficiency . in this kind of point - to - point communication ,",
    "directional antennas are a preferred means to avoid interference .    in general ,",
    "this can be achieved by adaptive beamforming . given a number of well - designed antenna elements at the transmitting /",
    "receiving sensor nodes , each node could in principle autonomously transmit / receive the information to / from any desired direction .",
    "the advantages and applications of beamforming with antenna arrays are well known ; in wireless communications , this enables space - division multiplex access ( sdma ) , a technology which has the potential to significantly increase the capacity of multiple access channels .",
    "one of the most important constraints on wireless sensors is energy efficiency .",
    "since the sensor nodes are often distributed in places where manual maintenance is costly , such as remote locations , on top of buildings and so on , it should be possible to operate these for several months without battery replacement . considering the fact that each antenna element requires analog circuitry ( and thus leads to costly hardware ) , in practice each distributed sensor is likely to be equipped with only a single antenna and this precludes the use of autonomous beamforming in scenarios of very energy efficient communication .",
    "nevertheless , if the sensors in the cluster share the information _ a priori _ and synchronously transmit the data collaboratively as sketched in fig.[fig : adhoc_network_model ] , it may be possible to beamform when transmitting ( and also receiving ) the data in a distributed manner",
    ". the resultant overhead due to intra - cluster information sharing may be relatively small as this can be done by low - cost short distance broadcasting - type communication among nodes .",
    "thus , with distributed collaborative beamforming , the nodes can send the collected information to the far - end receiver over long distances with high efficiency .",
    "also , only the sensor cluster in the specified target direction receives the data with high signal power and no significant interference occurs for clusters in other directions .",
    "overall there is thus a potential to increase the capacity of the multiple access channel significantly despite the additional overhead for information sharing .",
    "the obvious question is whether one can form a nice beampattern with a narrow mainbeam , or achieve a reasonable directional gain ( directivity ) .",
    "the sensor nodes in ad hoc networks are located randomly by nature , and the resultant beampattern depends on the particular realization of the sensor node locations .",
    "therefore , it may be quite natural to treat the beampattern with probabilistic arguments . in this paper",
    ", assuming idealized channel model conditions and antenna properties , we analyze the achievable performance of collaborative beamforming based on distributed sensor nodes in a probabilistic sense . specifically , the statistical properties of the achievable beampattern of the random sensor arrays are studied based on the following assumptions .",
    "the sensors form an ad hoc network and the geometry of the cluster is given by a two - dimensional disk of a given radius over which all sensor nodes are distributed uniformly as illustrated in fig.[fig : adhoc_network_model ] .",
    "since the corresponding far - field beampattern depends on the particular realization of the random array of nodes , the probability distribution of the far - field beampattern is of particular interest .    to the best of the authors knowledge ,",
    "the beampattern aspects of collaborative beamforming using random arrays have not been analyzed before in the framework of wireless ad hoc sensor networks .",
    "nevertheless , in the antenna design literature , probabilistic analysis of random arrays is not new . in the framework of linear array design with a large number of sensors ,",
    "lo @xcite has developed a comprehensive theory of random arrays in the late 1960s .",
    "it has been shown that randomly generated linear arrays with a large number of nodes can in fact form a good beampattern with high probability and that with linear random arrays of @xmath0 sensors , the directivity approaches @xmath0 asymptotically .",
    "although our scenario is quite different in that our main goal is not to design array geometry but to _ exploit _ the randomness of the distributed sensor network , it turns out that the results we shall develop in this paper can be seen as an extension of the theory of linear random arrays , @xcite , to random arrays on a disk .",
    "thus , the same conclusion will be reached : with @xmath0 collaborative sensor nodes , one can achieve a directivity of order @xmath0 asymptotically .    the major difference between classical beamforming by antenna arrays and distributed beamforming",
    "is that whereas the geometry of the former is usually known _ a priori _ , the exact location of the sensor nodes in ad hoc network is not , and it should be acquired dynamically . even if their relative location is estimated by some adaptive algorithm ( e.g. , @xcite for receiver beamforming ) , considering the low snr operation of the sensor nodes , it is almost certain that the acquired geometric information has some inaccuracy . also , since all nodes are operated with physically different local oscillators , each node may suffer from statistically independent phase offsets . in order to model and",
    "elucidate the effect of these impairments , we consider the following two scenarios : _ closed - loop _ and _ open - loop_. the closed - loop scenario may be described as follows .",
    "each node independently synchronizes itself to the beacon sent from the destination node ( such as a base station ) and adjusts its initial phase to it .",
    "thus , the beam will be formed in the direction of arrival of the beacon .",
    "this kind of system is often referred to as a _ self - phasing _ array in the literature , and may be effective for systems operating in time - division duplex ( tdd ) mode .",
    "the residual phase jitter due to synchronization and phase offset estimation among sensor nodes is then often the dominant impairment . on the other hand , in the open - loop scenario",
    "we assume that all nodes within the cluster acquire their relative locations from the beacon of a nearby reference point or cluster head .",
    "the beam will then be steered toward an arbitrary direction .",
    "thus , the destination need not transmit a beacon , but each node requires knowledge of its relative position from a predetermined reference point within the cluster .",
    "this case may occur in ad hoc sensor networks where sensor nodes do not have sufficient knowledge of the destination direction _ a priori_. in this scenario ,",
    "since the acquisition of precise knowledge is not realistic , the effects of location estimation ambiguity among sensors upon the beampattern may be of particular interest .    throughout the paper ,",
    "the nodes and channel are assumed to be static over the communication period , and for simplicity the information rate is assumed to be sufficiently low that inter - symbol interference ( isi ) , due to residual timing offset , is negligible .",
    "it will also be assumed that all nodes share the same transmitting information _ a priori _ , as the main focus of the paper is on the beampattern , rather than the front - end communication performance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] describes the assumptions , model , and main parameters that describe beam characteristics associated with the framework of wireless ad hoc sensor networks . in section [ sec : average_property ] , the average properties of the beampattern are derived .",
    "the average beampattern of linear random arrays has been derived in @xcite , and our results can be seen as its extension to our sensor network model . for analytical purpose , we also introduce the concept of 3 db sidelobe region . in section [ sec : distribution_beam ] , the statistical distribution of the beampattern in a specific direction is derived .",
    "lo @xcite has derived the distribution of the beampattern in linear arrays based on a gaussian approximation of the array factor , which is a common assumption in the random array literature .",
    "in contrast , we shall develop a numerical method to calculate the exact distribution of the beampattern and also examine the accuracy of the gaussian approximation in detail .",
    "the distribution of the maximum of the sidelobe region is discussed in section [ sec : distribution_maximum ] .",
    "this aspect of beampattern was analyzed by steinberg @xcite , agrawal and lo @xcite , and donvito and kassam @xcite in the framework of linear random arrays . in this paper",
    ", we derive an upper bound on the distribution of the maximum sidelobe in our framework of collaborative beamforming based on the approach of @xcite .",
    "the effect of phase jitter or location estimation errors on the resultant beampattern , associated with the closed - loop and open - loop scenarios , is analyzed in section [ sec : imperfect ] .",
    "steinberg @xcite has analyzed the effects of phase estimation errors in linear arrays , and based on a similar approach we analyze the effects of the average beampattern with phase estimation errors .",

    "each node is equipped with a single ideal isotropic antenna .",
    "all sensor nodes transmit identical energies , and the path losses of all nodes are also identical .",

    "the far - field beampattern is thus identical for both systems , and the received signal exhibits no difference as long as the base station compensates for this phase rotation",
    ".    therefore , there are two ways of forming a beam .",
    "one way is to use , but this approach requires accurate knowledge of the distance , relative to the wavelength @xmath21 , between each node and the destination .",

    "knowledge of the elevation direction @xmath8 is also required , but this may be assumed to be known _ a priori _ in many applications . in both cases , the synchronization among sensors is critical , which may be achieved by the use of reference signals such as those of the global positioning system ( gps ) .    of particular interest in practice is the case where @xmath30 , i.e. , the destination node is in the same plane as the collaborative sensor nodes .",
    "therefore , we will consider the beampattern in this plane and thus assume that @xmath31 for the rest of the paper .",
    "we then denote @xmath32 in by @xmath33 and @xmath34 for simplicity .    by assumption , the node locations @xmath6 follow the uniform distribution over the disk of radius @xmath4 .",

    "finally , the far - field beampattern can be defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50",
    "we start by investigating the average beampattern of the random array resulting from the distributed sensor network model in the previous section . here",
    ", the average is taken over all realizations of @xmath51 , and from the average beampattern is expressed as @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes expectation with respect to the random variables @xmath54 . from and , it can be readily shown that @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath57th order bessel function of the first kind . although the function @xmath58 is oscillatory , the local maxima of oscillation tend to decrease with increasing @xmath2 . in , the first term represents the average power level of the sidelobe , which does not depend on the node location , whereas the second term is the contribution of the mainlobe factor . since , conditioned on @xmath44 , the array factor of the form is an average of bounded independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d",
    ") complex random variables , by the weak law of large numbers the beampattern converges to the ensemble average in probability as @xmath59 .",

    "the @xmath57th peak and @xmath57th zero positions ( in the sense of the second term in ) can then be expressed asymptotically as @xmath76 since the peak sidelobe value does not depend on @xmath60 and is less sensitive to the value of @xmath0 , it is apparent that the only way one can avoid high peaks in the sidelobe region is to increase @xmath60 such that most of the major peaks are relatively concentrated around the mainlobe .",
    "this phenomenon will be further examined in the following subsections .",
    "one of the important figures of merit in directional antenna design is the 3db beamwidth . in the deterministic antenna , the 3db beamwidth is the threshold angle at which the power of the beampattern drops 3db below that in the target direction @xmath9 . in our scenario ,",
    "the 3db beamwidth itself is a random variable and it is not easy to characterize analytically .",
    "thus , as an alternative measure , we may define the 3db beamwidth of the _ average _ beampattern denoted by @xmath77 as the angle @xmath44 that satisfies @xmath78 in the limit as @xmath79 , one may obtain @xmath80 by numerically solving . for @xmath81 , can be approximated as @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the beamwidth is asymptotically independent of @xmath0 and is mainly determined by the inverse of the disk radius of the cluster .",
    "consequently , sparsely distributed sensors form a narrow beam on average provided that the cluster radius is sufficiently large .",
    "this sharp mainbeam property may be desirable , but if the far - field destination node has mobility , it should be designed carefully ; the calibration should take place before the mobile node moves out of the mainbeam , but the mainbeam width is inversely proportional to the normalized radius @xmath60 as observed in fig.[fig : avrage_beam ] .",
    "therefore , calibration should be performed more frequently if the destination node moves rapidly or when @xmath60 is increased .",
    "similar to the 3db beamwidth concept , it may also be convenient for our subsequent analysis to define the region within which the average of the sidelobe beampattern falls below some threshold level .",
    "as we have seen , for large @xmath60 , the sidelobe of the average beampattern is given by @xmath62 asymptotically .",
    "therefore , we shall define the _",
    "3db sidelobe region _ as the region in which neither neighboring sidelobe peak in the average beampattern exceeds 3db above @xmath62 . let @xmath83 denote the minimum index of the peak position such that the corresponding peak value satisfies this 3db condition . specifically , from , @xmath83 is the minimum integer @xmath57 that satisfies @xmath84 ^ 3 & \\leq 2 , \\label{3db_region_def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and it can be bounded by @xmath85 let @xmath86 denote the angle corresponding to the zero point next to the @xmath83th peak sidelobe which can be obtained from with @xmath87 .",
    "consequently , in this paper , the 3db sidelobe region is defined as @xmath88 fig.[fig:3dbdefs ] illustrates the definitions of the 3db sidelobe region together with that of the 3db beamwidth .",

    "thus we may reasonably assume that the array factor has zero mean in this region , and this assumption significantly simplifies the analysis of the statistical distribution in the following sections .",
    "fig.[fig : three_side ] shows the threshold angle above which the 3db sidelobe region begins .",
    "the asymptotic 3db beamwidth is also shown for reference . as can be observed , whereas the 3db beamwidth is less sensitive to the number of nodes @xmath0 , the 3db sidelobe region will be considerably reduced as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this means that as @xmath0 increases the dominant non - negligible sidelobe peak may occur with high probability unless @xmath60 is also increased .",
    "this trade - off will be clarified by the study of directivity in the following subsection .",

    "however , since by the law of large numbers the denominator of @xmath101 may approach its average value with high probability as @xmath0 increases , the above bound is expected to become tight as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this will be verified in the numerical results below . substituting into",
    ", we obtain @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a generalized hypergeometric function which monotonically decreases with increasing @xmath2 and converges to 0 as @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , unlike well - designed deterministic linear arrays , the gain of a given realization is very likely to be less than @xmath0 , and the limit @xmath0 can be approached only by increasing @xmath60 .",
    "this agrees with the previous observation that the average mainbeam becomes narrow as @xmath60 increases and thus improves the directivity .",
    "it should be noted that although has a simple form and offers some insight into the asymptotic behavior of directivity , the calculation of the generalized hypergeometric function involved in becomes numerically unstable as @xmath60 increases , and it is much easier to numerically integrate the denominator of directly .",
