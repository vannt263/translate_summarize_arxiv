    "low - temperature , layer  by  layer epitaxial growth techniques are commonly employed for creation of complex layered nanostructures with atomically flat interfaces and vanishing material intermixing at the interfaces . however , in some cases growth temperature or the after  growth annealing may result in a morphological reorganization of nominally layered structures adopting their shape to the given thermodynamic conditions .",

    "all processes are realized sequentially . at first new particles",
    "are adsorbed at the surface , then they can diffuse on the surface , perpendicularly to the growth direction . at the same kmc step those particles which are located within the bulk of the crystal may also change their positions .",
    "this process , the bulk diffusion , is isotropic in the directions perpendicular to the growth direction . in the direction parallel to the growth axis , however , the bulk diffusion in driven by an additional bias , associated with the growth course and temperature gradient . this sequence of dynamical processes is repeated in every step of the kmc process .",
    "we show that the assumed set of events leads to the formation of the structures observed in the experiments .",
    "because of the different crystal structure of pbte and cdte ( rock salt and zinc blende , respectively ) this material system is immiscible , i.e. in its ground state both components are separated .",
    "such situation can be described as follows : pbte crystal and cdte crystals have higher binding energy as a bulk than the interface energy between both materials .",
    "the energy of the interface between pbte and cdte slabs have been calculated in ref . by the formula @xmath5-\\frac{1}{2}e^{tot}[{\\rm cdte}]-\\frac{1}{2}e^{tot}[{\\rm pbte } ] \\big { ) } \\label{interface}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 $ ] means energy calculated for the supercell described within square brackets inside .",

    "all other contributions to the energy cancel out .",
    "we start our simulations with a thick cdte layer located at the bottom of the structure .",
    "the layer represents the 4@xmath20 m thick cdte buffer located between the substrate and the pbte / cdte structure in the real experiment . in the experiment",
    "the thickness of the buffer layer is much larger than that of the deposited layers , which have the thickness of several nanometers .",
    "because of computational limitations , however , the buffer in our simulations is only 50 atomic layers thick .",
    "we start mc simulation by adsorption of new particles on the initially prepared buffer .",
    "the particles are adsorbed at randomly chosen sites of the substrate or later on the top of the already deposited particles .",
    "the probability of this process is given by @xmath21 .",
    "we set @xmath22 ml/(mc step ) , what assuming appropriate time scale is equivalent to a typical , experimental growth rate of 1.3 @xmath23 .",
    "particles on top of the crystal and within the bulk of the crystal structure that is built up can diffuse at each mc step .",
    "two types of diffusion process are present - the bulk and the surface diffusion .",
    "both are thermally activated , they depend on the energy difference between the initial and the final state and there exists an energetic barrier for a single jump of a particle between the lattice sites . for the bulk diffusion we do not assume any specific mechanisms",
    ". it can be vacancy assisted or happen via interstitial positions .",
    "all these processes effectively give different energy barriers and can be projected into the switching of the positions of two nearest neighbors of different type .",
    "we realize this process by choosing randomly a particle in the bulk and then we select , also randomly , one of its six nearest neighbors . if the particles are of different type , the exchange is realized with the jump rate @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy difference of the system related to the change of the neighbors of the involved particles due to their jump calculated with the help of eq .",
    "( [ en ] ) .",
    "attempt frequency @xmath26 sets the time scale and is assumed to be equal to @xmath27 .",
    "the general energy barrier for diffusion for each single jump was estimated by the analysis of rates of the experimental processes at given temperatures what gave us the value @xmath28 mev",
    ".    with the energy difference calculated with help of eq.([en ] ) jumps lead to configurations where the number of neighboring particles of the same type is larger .",
    "this assures that the components do not mix with each other even at higher temperatures and the system is immiscible .",
    "the process of diffusion defined as above does not differentiate any direction . in the process of the growth , however ,",
    "the top of the crystal is distinguished as a place where particles attach .",
    "therefore vertical direction can be different for the particle diffusion .",
    "the crystal structure can be slightly different or there can even be more vacancies on going to the top of the multilayer structure .",
    "moreover the bottom of the crystal is the part where the sample is heated .",
    "if the sample is heated from the bottom , its temperature should decrease towards the top .",
    "we assumed that all these effects result in faster diffusion along the direction perpendicular to the substrate . to model this property a small driving force",
    "is added to the energy difference @xmath29 where @xmath30 denote the initial and the final positions of one of the particles exchanging positions and @xmath31 is a parameter , @xmath8 - the distance between successive layers .",
    "in such a way exchange of compounds along @xmath32 axis up or down becomes easier .",
    "we will show that this bias in the bulk diffusion is responsible for emergence of structures that are prolonged in the z - direction .",
    "the biased diffusion is known as a reason for a formation of stripped structures @xcite .",
    "we assume that some vertical temperature gradient is present .",
    "this gradient is assumed to be not large enough to change noticeably diffusion rate from one position to the other , so we leave the diffusion rate across the layers unchanged",
    ". however both material components are not identical .",
    "not only their lattice structures are different but also the thermal conductivity of pbte is much lower than that of cdte ( 1.9 and 6.2 w / mk , respectively ) and their bulk energies should differ . when the income from the temperature gradient is calculated as the first correction to the jump barrier in the exponent of rate ( [ prob ] ) it becomes proportional to the bulk energy difference .",
    "pbte should be then more strongly influenced by the temperature gradient because it is expected to be larger than in cdte .",
    "the difference between the values of the bias should reflect the asymmetry between the two components that was seen in the experiment at high temperatures when the cdte deposits gather on the top of quasi bulk pbte . to model",
    "this we assume parameter @xmath31 different for pbte and for cdte .",
    "thus we set a small difference between values of @xmath31 , choosing the bias values for pbte moving up @xmath33 mev and for cdte moving up @xmath34 mev .",
    "the bulk diffusion is realized in each mc step together with the surface diffusion at the top crystal layer .",
    "the surface diffusion is performed by choosing randomly a particle on the surface and making it move to an empty neighboring site at the same level , i.e. , with the same z - coordinates or jump down to an empty place to the lower layer . jumps up are disallowed what additionally promotes the surface smoothening .",
    "the probability of a single surface diffusion jump is @xmath35 the values of @xmath26 and @xmath36 are kept the same as in the process of bulk diffusion , however because particles are less connected to the surface and they can jump to the empty site the surface processes are faster than bulk ones . for the studied systems the role of the surface diffusion is reduced mainly to smoothening of the surface after new particles are adsorbed on it .",
    "we will show however that in different conditions the process of surface diffusion in our model can lead to the ordered structure of one dimensional stripes as it was discussed before @xcite .    in our kmc simulations subsequent layers",
    "are grown in the similar way as it was done in the experiment .",
    "the type of the currently adsorbed particles changes periodically , starting from pbte .",
    "for the fixed value of the adsorption rate deposition duration of each of the components can be chosen in such a way that in each repetition pbte and cdte consist of the desired number of atomic layers . assuming the lattice constants @xmath8 of 6.46@xmath37 for pbte and 6.48@xmath37 for cdte , we need approximately 12 atomic layers of pbte and 32 atomic layers of cdte to simulate the real growth conditions .",
    "it corresponds to the thicknesses of the layers used in the experiment @xcite .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations based on the microscopic model described in this section .",
    "we set the size of the crystal @xmath3880 particles both in the x and y direction . we assume the periodic boundary conditions in both those directions .",

    "for instance , the highest pbte layer , plotted as the first from the top , has no cdte holes inside .",
    "the holes appear , however , in the lower layers and in the lowest one a few cdte holes of larger size are clearly visible .",
    "the observation indicates an onset of the reorganization of horizontal 2d layers into 1d percolation networks , which later would disintegrate into pbte quantum dots embedded in cdte matrix .",
    "the process much more affects the layers which were deposited first because they stayed at the growth temperature for longer time than those deposited at the end of the growth .",
    "this indicates that the bulk diffusion plays the role in the reorganization process . in our simulations",

    "yet the surface diffusion takes also place in the self - organizing process and its mean rate is of the same order as this of the bulk one .",
    "the main role of the surface diffusion in our system is the surface alignment . yet , many works show how the stripe ordering results as an effect of the surface diffusion@xcite .",
    "such process indeed is possible in our system also but not at the experimental conditions that are studied here . to illustrate this",
    "we show that the deposition of thinner multilayers eventually leads to the stripe formation starting at the surface of grown crystal .",
    "we studied the process of crystal grow at the lowest temperature of t=@xmath73c and with the same growth rate as in fig .",
    "[ cross_sections1 ] and the ratio of delivered components is the same . what we have changed as compared to the first situation is the width of the deposited multilayers . we have grown the crystal by setting one pbte layer and three cdte layers . in fig  [ layers ] we can see that the geometries of the grown structures are completely different in left panels - for thicker layers and in right panels - for thinner layers .",
    "thicker multilayers stay more or less two - dimensional , they eventually perforate during further growth process . in the second case , when multilayers are very thin striped structure builds just from the beginning .",
    "the main mechanism of this process is surface diffusion , that has a possibility of ordering the material during growth process .",
    "the final striped structure can be seen in fig  [ 3d ] .",
    "resulting columns are straight , spread from bottom to top , but they have some additional structure in the vertical direction .",
    "they are wider at the bottom than at the top .",
    "this last feature evidently is due to still active bulk diffusion and the existing anisotropy in the component diffusion . when surface diffusion is left as the only dynamical process in the system above it results in creating columns very similar to this seen in fig .",
    "[ layers ] , but not so regular , with not so smooth surfaces and of the same width from bottom to top .",
    "we proposed model that correctly reproduces all types of experimentally observed morphological evolutions of the pbte / cdte structures at different temperatures@xcite .",
    "depending on the growth conditions combination of bulk and surface diffusion cooperate in the process of spinodal decomposition of immiscible materials and lead to the formation of 1d elongated structures or 0d spherical droplets . additionally , present in the process of crystal growth vertical bias orders created structures in the shape of vertical columns collecting material from several deposited layers .",
    "formation of such columns starts from the bottom of multilayer structure and lasts all time until structure is grown .",
    "this is exactly the case of experimental systems @xcite .",
    "the small difference in bias is main ground for the phase separation locating pbte phase at the bottom and cdte at top at temperatures as high as @xmath74c .",
    "we have shown that the same model leads to other patterns like long columns spreading from bottom to to top when different deposition schema is applied .",
    "it can be seen that the structure formation in the immiscible compounds can be controlled both by temperature change and by the deposition method .",
