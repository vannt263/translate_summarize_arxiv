    "there are indications both from observations and theoretical studies that stars in many astrophysical environments may have the relative abundances of elements synthesized by nuclear @xmath4-capture reactions ( e.g.  c , o , ne , mg , si , ti , etc ) that are enhanced with respect to the solar ones . in brief , king ( 1994 ) found the mean [ o / fe ] ratio for a handful of halo stars to be @xmath8  dex .",
    "similar results are found for globular cluster stars ( e.g.  [ @xmath9=0.18 $ ]  dex for 47 tuc , carney 1996 ) and galactic bulge k giants ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 , rich & mcwilliam 2000 ) . according to models of chemical evolution of the galaxy ,",
    "bulge stars should be @xmath4-enhanced to reproduce the metallicity distribution ( matteucci & brocato 1990 , matteucci et al .",
    "indications that the abundance ratios of elements in elliptical galaxies are not solar ( e.g. @xmath10 = 0.3 - 0.7 $ ]  dex ) come from worthey et al .",
    "also synthetic metal line strengths ( weiss , peletier & matteucci 1995 ) from high - metallicity models show that solar - scaled models do not fit the observed mg2 ( 5180   ) and fe ( 5270 and 5335   ) line indices .    given these premises ,",
    "it is of paramount importance to include the enhancement of @xmath4-elements in the population synthesis models designed to describe those galaxies . in the past",
    "this has been done but using models that suffered from many limitations .",
    "firstly , till recently there were no extended sets of opacities for @xmath4-enhanced mixtures covering the complete relevant range of stellar temperatures .",
    "such opacity calculations are nowadays available .",
    "secondly , it has often been assumed that the behaviour of @xmath4-enhanced isochrones can be easily mimicked by suitably scaling the metallicity  ( salaris et al .",
    "1993 ) . however , the validity of such a re - scaling has only been confirmed for low metallicities , and it holds only for some particular cases like all @xmath4-elements being enhanced by the same factor .",
    "weiss et al .  ( 1995 ) already pointed out the differences in the evolution due to @xmath4-enhancement at solar and super - solar metallicities .",
    "recent work by salaris & weiss ( 1998 ) and vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also indicates that the simple re - scaling of the  content becomes risky at high metallicities .",
    "moreover , we should keep in mind that there is no _ a priori _ reason , from the point of view of both nucleosynthetic and chemical evolution theories , to expect that all @xmath4-elements are enhanced by the same factor . from observations of halo and bulge stars ,",
    "the degree of enhancement of different @xmath4-elements is , in general , not constant with differences amounting to @xmath11  dex .",
    "therefore in this paper we intend to re - analyze the impact of the enhancement of @xmath4-elements on the properties of metal - rich stellar populations ( whose metallicity ranges from half - solar to three times - solar ) .",
    "the analysis is made for a particular choice of abundance ratios , for which self - consistent opacities are available .",
    "we start calculating extended sets of stellar evolutionary tracks ( sect .",
    "[ sec_tracks ] ) , with total metal contents @xmath12 , 0.019 , 0.040 and 0.070 both for solar - scaled ( same abundance ratios as in the solar mix ) and @xmath4-enhanced patterns of abundances .",
    "particular attention is paid to the description of the adopted initial element abundances and sources of opacity .",
    "based on those stellar models we derive large grids of isochrones and single stellar populations for which we present magnitudes , colours and mass - to - light ratios in many pass - bands of the johnson and wfpc2 photometric systems ( sect .",

    "are combined with the molecular opacities provided by alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) for the solar mixtures , and by alexander ( priv .",
    "communication ) for the ones . in both cases ,",
    "low- and high - temperature opacity grids are merged by interpolation in the temperature range from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "for very high temperatures , @xmath31 , the weiss et al .",
    "( 1990 ) opacities are used .",
    "these rely on the los alamos opacity database .",
    "the radiative opacities for c , o mixtures , needed in the post - main sequence phases , are from iglesias & rogers ( 1993 ) . finally , conductive opacities of electron - degenerate matter are from itoh et al .",
    "( 1983 ) .",
    "it is very important to emphasize that the present models are based on _ complete and consistent opacities _ ,",
    "i.e.   the opacities ( both for solar and mixtures ) are generated for the same pattern of abundances adopted in the stellar models , both at low and high temperatures .",
    "the importance of this issue is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ compare_opacity_hr ] , which shows the effect in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram of adopting different ( inconsistent ) opacities and/or mixtures and/or enhancement factors as input to a 1  @xmath14 main sequence model with @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "some of the illustrated cases are often found in literature .",
    "the tracks are evolved up to the solar age of 4.6 gyr .",
    "the meaning of the labels is the following : the first label refers to high temperature opacity ( @xmath33 ) and can vary from opal - s , i.e.  solar - scaled mixture , to opal-@xmath4 , i.e.  enhanced according to salaris & weiss ( 1998 ; w95 ) or rogers ( priv .",
    "communication ; r95 ) .",
    "this latter case is a special @xmath4-enhanced mixture characterized , if compared with salaris & weiss ( 1998 ) , by more c , less o , more ne , more na ( which is not an alpha - element ) , less al , more s , and more fe .",
    "the second label refers to the molecular opacity , with the same notation as for solar and @xmath4-enhanced mixtures .",
    "af stands for alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) .",
    "the prescription enclosed in a box represents the one adopted by us .",
    "another point to emphasize is the difference between the present opacities and those used by girardi et al .",
    "two are the main sources of differences .",
    "first the adoption of the itoh et al .",
    "( 1983 ) conductive opacities instead of the older ones by hubbard & lampe ( 1969 ) .",
    "interestingly , catelan et al .  ( 1996 ) show that itoh et al .",
    "( 1983 ) conductive opacities should not be used in rgb models , because they are valid only for a liquid phase , and not for the physical conditions existing in the interiors of rgb stars .",
    "however , we verified that the effect of using the itoh et al .",
    "( 1983 ) opacities instead of the hubbard & lampe ( 1969 ) is to increase the core mass at the helium flash by 0.006  ( see also castellani et al .  2000 and cassisi et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is a negligible effect .",
    "the second difference lies in the numerical technique used to interpolate within the grids of the opacity tables . in this paper",
    "we use the two - dimensional bi - rational cubic damped - spline algorithm ( see & weiss 1998 ; and spth 1973 ) , whereas girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) adopted the smooth bi - parabolic spline interpolation ( ssi ) already introduced in our code by bressan et al .",
    "we verified that the differences amount to about a few percent .    in general ,",
    "evolutionary models of low mass differ very little by changing the opacity interpolation scheme",
    ". however , massive stars ( say @xmath34 ) are much more sensitive to the interpolation algorithm .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ compare_tracks_6msun ] , where we plot two 4  and 6  models with @xmath35 $ ] calculated both with the ssi ( continuous lines ) and the damped - spline ( dashed lines ) scheme .",
    "figure  [ compare_opacity_inner ] compares the effects of the different interpolations on the opacity at the physical conditions holding in the inner regions of a 6  star when the central hydrogen mass fraction is @xmath36 , i.e.  at the stage marked with a dot in fig .",
    "[ compare_tracks_6msun ] . at this stage",
    "the temperature at the schwarzschild border of the convective core is @xmath37 and the density is @xmath38 ( corresponding to the arrow in the fig .",
    "[ compare_opacity_inner ] ) . for the temperatures indicated along the curves ,",
    "these represent the opacity as a function of the quantity @xmath39 ( see rogers & iglesias 1992 for more details ) .",
    "the continuous curve is based on the ssi interpolation , whereas the dashed curve refers to the method adopted in the present study .",
    "the small difference in opacity at the core border is typical of the values found throughout the evolutionary sequences , and is responsible for the different hr patterns .",
    "we notice that both interpolations are acceptable , because the percentage error associated to both of them is roughly 3 % , which is lower than the opacity uncertainty in the original opal tables ( the latter can be as high as 10 % at individual @xmath40 points ) .",
    "this shows that even the fine opal grid for some applications is not sufficiently dense and more grid points might be needed .",
    "this is also illustrated by the solar model by schlattl & weiss ( 1998 ) , where the inverse situation , i.e.  spline producing a nicer opacity run , is found .",
    "the reason for the different luminosities in the high - mass models , is that in these stars the radiative gradient across the border of the convective core is shallow .",
    "therefore , even slightly larger opacities at the schwarzschild border may cause an increase of the convective core and lead to higher luminosities .",
    "this trend already begins during the core h - burning phase and remains during the subsequent evolution .",
    "the effects are detectable starting from stars with mass larger than @xmath41   ( see fig .",
    "[ compare_tracks_6msun ] ) and becomes dramatic over 60  .",

    "this causes an increase of 0.005  in the core mass at helium ignition .",
    "we have checked this on a 1  model with @xmath42 .",
    "differences of the same order have been found by other authors ( e.g.  haft et al .",
