    "evidence that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating @xcite has led to the conclusion that the dominant cosmic component is `` dark energy '' , a negative pressure ( yet smoothly - distributed ) material . but given problems related to magnitude fine - tuning @xcite and `` coincidences '' @xcite for a cosmological constant ( @xmath0 )  and more unknowns for evolving forms of dark energy ",
    "an attractive alternative is known as `` backreaction '' , in which the ( apparent ) acceleration is a natural result of the ever - increasing inhomogeneity of the structure - forming universe ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "presently , backreaction is not widely considered to be a viable method for achieving the observed acceleration @xcite . elsewhere",
    "@xcite , i discuss how this seeming inadequacy of backreaction is likely due to the neglect of crucial physics via the use of overly trivial backreaction models .",
    "some neglected physics includes : the dropping of vorticity for the virialization of stabilized structures ; the dropping of `` small amplitude '' ( but _ cumulatively _ important ) terms in perturbation theory such as time derivatives , and velocity terms at least up to @xmath1 $ ] ; the neglect of tensor components and ` gravitomagnetic ' terms , which carry gravitational perturbation information _ causally _ , at @xmath2 ; the neglect of the cumulative _ overlap _ of different perturbations , artificially isolating each one from all others ( they just `` fall out of the expansion '' ) , as in swiss - cheese models ; and the debatable view ( from newtonian cosmology ) that ( individually ) newtonian - strength perturbations must yield essentially no backreaction .    our approach here , in contrast , is to try to include _ all _ of the necessary physics of backreaction  even at the cost of using a very simplified model  rather than using a more sophisticated ( or even exact ) model of a _ physically _ simplified universe .    utilizing the straightforward nature of the `` before '' vs. `` after '' cosmic states  that is , quantifying the total effect of the transition from smooth universe to `",
    "fully clustered '  it can be argued @xcite that the net effect of the formation of a vorticity - stabilized , virialized cluster far from a given observation point @xmath3 , should be the simple addition of the newtonian metric perturbation due to that cluster s stabilized mass , to the overall ( initially frw ) metric at @xmath3 .",
    "for any point @xmath3 , since the number of perturbing contributions increases with distance as @xmath4 , but each contribution only weakens as @xmath5 , the summed effect of all such contributions can become dominantly large  limited only by the look - back distance out to which an observer at @xmath3 can ` see ' stabilized structures , at that given time .",
    "the total metric perturbation ( at _ any _ given observation point , in a `` smoothly - inhomogeneous '' universe ) as a function of time , @xmath6 , is thus given by an integral over the ( retarded ) clumping that is felt from great distances at the observation point , as per eq .",

[ figsnraytraceints ] ) : @xmath7   ~ [ ( t_{0 } / t)^{2/3 } ] \\ } ~   \\alpha ~ d \\alpha ~ . \\label{eqnitotintegration}\\ ] ]    to an observer at @xmath3 , new clustered masses thus seem to ` appear ' over time ( as attractive , perturbing forces ) as the material within each one transitions from smoothly distributed and almost motionless , to clumped and vorticity - stabilized . and",
    "though each such perturbation is ` newtonian ' in strength ( as seen at @xmath3 ) , the total , summed metric perturbation will grow ever stronger as more virialized clusters ` come into view ' , eventually becoming strong enough to generate the apparent acceleration .",
    "this accumulation of perturbation effects from cosmologically - distant new structures , coming in towards @xmath3 at speed @xmath2 , is called `` causal updating '' @xcite .    averaging over clumps distributed randomly in direction , we get the metric : @xmath8 ~ dt^{2 }   ~ + ~ \\ { [ a_{\\mathrm{md}}(t)]^{2 } ~   [ 1 + ( 1/3 ) i(t ) ] \\ }   ~ \\vert d \\vec{r } \\vert ^{2 } ~ .   \\label{eqnfinalbhpertmetric}\\ ] ] this is the final metric ( computed for any given `` clumping evolution model '' , @xmath9 $ ] ) to be used for calculating hubble curves , and all cosmological parameters of interest .",
    "though several models were found in ref .   which provided acceptable fits to the scp union1 snia data @xcite , those initial backreaction simulations neglected an important complication : the fact that _ old _ metric perturbations from pre - existing structures slows down all _ future _ propagation of inhomogeneity information ( from new structures , from old structures even farther away , etc . ) .",
    "this weakens causal updating , so that causal backreaction has a negative feedback upon itself ( making an `` eternal '' acceleration very unlikely here ) . the causal backreaction response",
    "to clustering is therefore ` recursive ' and nonlinear in terms of response versus clustering strength , and thus a second - generation model of causal backreaction was designed to incorporate the effects of these `` recursive nonlinearities '' ( as distinct from _ gravitational _ nonlinearities ) .",
    "this new formalism , and a full suite of simulation runs , fit results , and cosmological parameters obtained with it , are given in ref .  .",
    "the principal result of this study , is that astrophysically realistic causal backreaction models can indeed be chosen which successfully mimic the apparent acceleration generically attributed to @xmath0 , but without any form of dark energy , voids , etc .",
    "some of these models , plotted against the union1 snia data , are shown in fig .",
    "[ figvaryingearlysatzval ] .",
    "though successful at reproducing the ` acceleration ' , quite a large amount of clustering is needed  a nearly - complete clustering on several different hierarchical scales , simultaneously (  stellar clusters , galaxies , galaxy clusters  ) .",
    "a more moderate amount of final clustering is sufficient , though , for models in which structure formation saturates at late times due to `` gastrophysics '' feedback , and due to clustering slow - down ( still present in this formalism ) from the ` acceleration ' itself .    from the final results for our",
    "` best - fitting ' models found ( even without a rigorous optimization ) , the output cosmological parameters were calculated , as would be seen by cosmic observers at @xmath10 ( such as ourselves ) .",
    "these values are presented in table [ tabrnlearlysatrunsabbrev ] , where it is clear that there are backreaction models for which all of the cosmological parameters considered here  including the observed hubble constant ( @xmath11 ) , the observed age of the universe ( @xmath12 ) , the matter density required for spatial flatness ( @xmath13 ) , the characteristic angular scale of the cmb acoustic peaks ( @xmath14 ) , and the strength of the apparent acceleration ( @xmath15 )  are each broadly consistent with those from the @xmath0cdm cosmologies of the `` concordance model '' .",
    "it can therefore be concluded that a new , alternative concordance can indeed be achieved with causal backreaction , without any mysterious `` dark energy '' cosmic component being required .",
    "finally , higher - order terms in the expansion ( @xmath16 , etc . ) could potentially be used to distinguish between @xmath0cdm and causal backreaction .",
