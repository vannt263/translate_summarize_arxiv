    "galaxy clusters play an important role in precision cosmology that complements other techniques like type ia supernovae luminosity - distance relation measurements @xcite , baryonic acoustic oscillations ( baos ) angular - distance relation measurements @xcite , and observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "for example , @xcite exploit dark energy s influence on the growth of structure by using 37 moderate - redshift and 49 low - redshift clusters to measure the shape of the galaxy - cluster mass function and its redshift evolution , which constrain the dark - energy density parameter @xmath1 to @xmath2 in a non - flat @xmath3 cosmology and the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath4 to @xmath5 in a flat cosmology . @xcite",
    "have obtained similar results from measurements of the evolving number density of the largest clusters in order to constrain @xmath4 to @xmath6 .",
    "strategies like these that compare model predictions to galaxy - cluster sample statistics inevitably confront sample error and sample bias .",
    "future surveys expected to gather samples of 1040 thousand galaxy clusters will maximize survey reach while maintaining sufficient observation quality in order to minimize sample error , but they still must grapple with a major source of sample bias , which is scatter in the relationship used to infer cluster mass from an observable mass proxy . an important mass - observable relation for galaxy cluster studies",
    "connects dark matter halo mass to the temperature of the intracluster medium ( icm ) inferred from its x - ray spectrum ( its `` x - ray temperature '' @xmath7 ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility of correcting for scatter in this relation using temperature - inhomogeneity in the icm , and discuss challenges that may exist in such a program .",
    "a significant amount of uncertainty in the dark - energy constraints obtainable from large cluster surveys derives from uncertainty in scatter about the mean scaling relations obeyed by galaxy clusters bulk properties @xcite .",
    "the key galaxy cluster property to measure when trying to constrain dark energy with clusters is the cluster s mass , which can not be directly observed .",
    "theoretical considerations predict correlations among halo mass and more readily observed cluster properties , like its galaxy richness , the velocity dispersion of its galaxies , @xmath7 , the sunyaev - zeldovich decrement , the gas mass , and @xmath8 parameter , which is the product of @xmath7 and the gas mass inferred from x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "theory also predicts intrinsic scatter in these relations owing to variation in cluster dynamical state ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one way to deal with intrinsic scatter is to join a cluster model to a cosmological model and simultaneously fit for the parameters of both , leveraging the statistical power of large surveys and `` self - calibrating '' the mass - observable relations .",
    "another approach is to combine observables that tend to depart from the expected scaling relations in opposite ways , yielding a new , low - scatter composite observable .",
    "an example low - scatter composite observable is @xmath8 , since at a given halo mass , offsets in the measured gas mass at fixed total mass tend to anti - correlate with offsets in the measured temperature @xcite .",
    "another family of low - scatter composite observables attempt to measure structural variation directly . mergers , relaxation , and non - adiabatic processes like radiative cooling , star formation , and feedback ought to leave a visible imprint that may allow us to measure and correct for scatter .",
    "for example , one might use imaging to quantify resolved morphological substructure .",
    "@xcite apply two observationally - motivated structure measures , the power ratios @xcite and the centroid shift @xcite , to a sample of galaxy clusters simulated with  @xcite .",
    "they find that cluster structure correlates strongly with bias in mass estimates derived from @xmath7 under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and accounting for cluster structure can be used to correct some of the bias .",
    "similarly , @xcite apply the power ratios , centroid shift , and axial ratio @xcite substructure measures to the same sample of simulated clusters used in this paper , and find that cluster substructure correlates with departures from the mean  relationship in the sense that clusters with more substructure tend to have a lower temperature at a given mass , and can be used to refine mass estimates derived from the icm x - ray temperature .",
    "@xcite likewise find that greater substructure , as quantified with power ratios , correlates with lower temperature at a given mass .",
    "@xcite find a strong correlation between mass - temperature scatter and halo concentration in their sample of simulated clusters , with cooler clusters appearing more concentrated than warmer clusters at similar mass .",
    "@xcite observe , however , that line - of - sight projection effects lead to significant uncertainties in morphologically - derived substructure measures .",
    "substructure also becomes more difficult to resolve at high redshift .",
    "spectral signatures of dynamical state are therefore attractive because they are aspect - independent and redshift - independent .",
    "one such spectral signature of dynamical state is the `` temperature ratio '' @xcite , which divides a `` hardband '' spectral - fit temperature by a `` broadband '' spectral - fit temperature .",
    "an energy cut applied to a broadband spectrum produces a hardband spectrum and serves to filter out cooler line - emitting components of the icm .",
    "@xcite studied the effects of relaxation on the observable properties of galaxy clusters , using a sample of numerically - simulated galaxy clusters generated by @xcite .",
    "they found that hardband ( 2.09.0 kev ) x - ray spectral fit temperatures average @xmath920% higher than broadband ( 0.59.0 kev ) temperatures and suggested that this effect may signal the presence of cool , luminous sub - clusters lowering the broadband temperature .",
    "@xcite corroborated these findings in simulations that included radiative cooling .",
    "figures [ fig : f01 ] and [ fig : f02 ] illustrate the effect . both show a counts spectrum and single - temperature fit for a typical , unrelaxed cluster in our sample , with an aperture set at @xmath10 and a core region out to @xmath11 excised .",
    "figure [ fig : f01 ] is for a single - temperature model fit to the broad band , while figure [ fig : f02 ] is for the hard band . note the excess emission relative to the model above 4.0 kev and the deficit below 2.5 kev that arises because the model can not simultaneously fit both a hot component and a cooler , line - emitting component @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : f02 ] shows the same spectrum , but with the residuals for a model fit just to the hard band . in this case",
    "the fit is much better over the range from 2.0 to 7.0 kev but under - predicts the emission below 2.0  kev .",
    "@xcite suggested that the temperature skewing they observed might indicate a real temperature skewing detectable in real clusters using .",
    "@xcite fit single - temperature emission models to the hard band ( 2.07.0 kev ) and broad band ( 0.77.0 kev ) for a large ( n = 192 ) sample of clusters with observations selected from the  data archive .",
    "these authors show that for a large , heterogeneous sample of clusters across a broad temperature range , the distribution of  has a mean of 1.16 and an rms deviation @xmath12 , with  tending to be larger in merging systems .",
    "they also report that while this signal is significant in the aggregate , the errors for any single measurement and the scatter across all of the measurements together pose challenges for any effort to use  either to select for merging systems or to obtain more accurate mass estimates . in order to meet these challenges",
    "it is important also to examine  and similar spectral signatures of dynamical state in a simulation context . like the original study of @xcite , this paper examines the temperature ratio for a sample of simulated clusters and simulated  observations , and as in the subsequent study by @xcite ,",
    "the simulated clusters analyzed here were generated using a hydrodynamical code with radiative cooling included .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath13",
    ", we describe the simulated clusters in our sample along with the 2 code for generating their mock x - ray observations . in @xmath14 , we present our analysis methods and define the spectral signatures of dynamical state we examine . in @xmath15 , we report and discuss our results , and @xmath16 summarizes our work .",
    "this study is based on an analysis of 118 clusters simulated using the cosmological hydrodynamics tree+sph code gadget-2 @xcite , which were simulated in a standard @xmath17 cold dark matter ( @xmath17cdm ) universe with matter density @xmath18 = 0.3 , @xmath19 = 0.7 , @xmath20 = 0.04 , and @xmath21 = 0.8 .",
    "the simulation includes radiative cooling assuming an optically - thin gas of primordial composition , with a time - dependent uv background from a population of quasars , and handles star formation and supernova feedback using a two - phase fluid model with cold star - forming clouds embedded in a hot medium .",
    "all but four of the clusters are from the simulation described in @xcite , who simulated a box @xmath22 on a side , with @xmath23 dark matter particles and an equal number of gas particles .",
    "the present analysis considers the 114 most massive clusters within this box at @xmath24 , which all have @xmath25 greater than @xmath26 .",
    "these are referred to as the b04 sample in the remainder of this paper . by convention",
    ", @xmath27 refers to the mass contained in a sphere which has a mean density of @xmath28 times the critical density @xmath29 , and whose radius is denoted by @xmath30    that cluster set covers the @xmath91.5 - 5 kev temperature range , but the @xmath22 box is too small to contain significantly hotter clusters .",
    "we therefore supplemented it with four clusters with masses @xmath31 and temperatures @xmath32 kev drawn from a dark - matter - only simulation in a larger @xmath33 box @xcite , referred to in this paper as the d09 sample .",
    "the cosmology for this simulation also was @xmath17cdm , but with @xmath21 = 0.9 .",
    "these were then re - simulated including hydrodynamics , radiative cooling , and star formation , again with gadget-2 and using the zoomed - initial - conditions technique of @xcite , with a fourfold increase in resolution .",
    "this is comparable to the resolution of the clusters in the smaller box . adding these four massive clusters to our sample",
    "gives a total of 118 clusters with @xmath25 in the range @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "the mean structural properties of massive clusters drawn from a sample with @xmath21 = 0.9 may differ somewhat from those of similar - mass clusters in a @xmath21 = 0.8 universe because they reflect a more advanced state of cosmic evolution .",
    "however , these four additional clusters carry minimal statistical weight in the context of the overall sample .",
    "they are included primarily to evaluate whether the mean and dispersion of their @xmath36 values are consistent with those of the lower - mass systems .",
    "the simulated galaxy clusters in our sample are processed with the _ x - ray map simulator _ version 2 ( 2 ) @xcite to generate x - ray images suitable for standard  reduction techniques . in its",
    "first step 2 uses the outputs of the hydrodynamic code to calculate the emissivity of each simulation element within the chosen field of view and to project this onto the image plane . in its second step",
    "it convolves the resulting flux with the appropriate response of a given detector . in the case of our simulated observations ,",
    "the second step applies the response matrix file and ancillary response file for the acis s3 ccd , with a 200 kilosecond exposure time . in order to separate out potential calibration issues from the focus of this particular study , these response matrices implement a constant response over the detector , and in generating the simulated x - ray images ,",
    "the evolved zero - redshift clusters are shifted to a redshift sufficient to fit @xmath37 within the 16 arcminute field of view .",

    "step filters each raw event file into a new set of event files by randomly sampling the events it records .",
    "the number of counts in each file is its `` count level , '' and in order to cover the space of typical  archival observations , we apply the filtering step to each of the raw event files four times , at count levels 15k , 30k , 60k , and 120k .",

    "we use its default sequence of wavelet scale sizes in this analysis ( 2 and 4 pixels ) , though we apply the tool four times to each filtered event file , each time incrementing the multiplicative factor by which the source regions are scaled . in ciao `",
    "wavdetect ` , the parameter governing this multiplicative factor is ` ellsigma ` and in our study ranges between 0 to 3 .",
    "a value of 0 for ` ellsigma ` is equivalent to `` no masking '' while a value of 3 corresponds to what we call `` full masking '' .",
    "the effect is to produce versions of each cluster observation with a range of masking .",

    "the simulated clusters occupy a range of redshifts because larger clusters are translated to higher redshifts in order to fit @xmath37 within 16 arc - minutes , when creating artificial observations .",
    "the second fit is over the broad band , including all energy channels in the spectrum from 0.77 kev .",
    "every fit is made by minimizing the @xmath53 statistic for a single - temperature mekal model multiplied by a warm - absorber ( wabs , to account for galactic absorption ) .",
    "the galactic column is fixed to @xmath54 and the metallicity to 0.3 solar , leaving the temperature of the emission component , its h density ( although this makes no difference ) , and its normalization as the only free parameters .",
    "we adopt two spectral measurements of temperature structure .",
    "the first is the temperature ratio  of @xcite and is found in the following way . for each simulated cluster in our sample , for each count level ( 15k , 30k , 60k , 120k ) , and for each cool lump masking level ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) , we find a spectral - fit temperature in the hard band and the broad band and form the temperature ratio .",
    "emission from cooler , line - emitting metal - rich parts of the icm ought to be excluded from the hard band , so we expect that a  value greater than unity signals the presence of merging sub - clumps .",
    "our second measure of temperature , which we call the `` cool residual , '' ( @xmath55 ) compares an observation s actual broadband count rate to a model - predicted count rate for a spectral model fit only over the hard band .",
    "again , we determined a spectral - fit temperature for each combination of cluster , count level , and masking level , except that in this case we performed only a hardband fit . since emission from cooler components",
    "should be excluded from this band , in general we achieve good fits even when the count level is sufficiently high that broadband fits may formally have large reduced @xmath53 values . from this hardband model fit",
    "we estimate the corresponding broadband count rate and calculate its percentage deviation from the actual broadband count rate . while single - temperature systems will have actual count rates that are essentially the same as their model count rates , the introduction of cooler",
    ", luminous substructure components should generate an excess broadband count rate relative to the model .",
    "this measure of temperature substructure avoids the uncertainties associated with a single - temperature fit to the broad band .",
    "having calculated spectral - fit temperatures , , and the cool residual for all of the clusters in our sample , we have the means to study how well temperature structure correlates with departures from the mean  relation , and how well these measures can be used to obtain better mass estimates .",
    "we will also examine how our results depend on the removal of the cool lumps .",
    "we present in figure [ fig : f05 ] the temperature ratios  for our simulation sample , plotted as a function of the broadband temperature fit .",
    "this figure is similar to figure 8 in @xcite , which shows that the mean value of  observed among clusters in the _ chandra _ archive is @xmath56 , with a standard deviation of @xmath57 .",
    "we remind the reader of important differences between the two samples being considered .",
    "the archive sample of @xcite contains clusters most of which have @xmath58 3 kev , whereas most of the clusters in our sample have @xmath59 3 kev .",
    "nevertheless , even with that caveat the temperature ratios of the simulated clusters are distributed in approximately the same way as are those in the real sample of @xcite , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 , provided the cool lumps are not excised ( circles in figure [ fig : f05 ] ) . when the cool lumps are excised ( squares in figure [ fig : f05 ] ) ,",

    "this table provides mean values for  and its variance for all of the clusters in the sample , and for a subset whose  value is greater than 2 kev .",
    "much of the variance derives from the lower - temperature clusters , and as they are removed the variance in  drops significantly , especially when full masking is applied .",
    "figure [ fig : f06 ] presents a similar effect for @xmath55 . here , we see that the excision of cool lumps again reduces the mean and variance of the temperature substructure measure ,",
    "although in this case the effect is more dramatic . evidently , the presumably unphysical cool lumps in simulated clusters may be necessary to reproduce the distribution of quantitative temperature substructure measures found in real clusters .",
    "this is a subject which we return to in section [ sec : masking ] .",
    "our original motivation for conducting this study was to determine if temperature structure , as quantified by the temperature ratio , correlates with and can be used to correct for departures from the mean mass - temperature relation . in order to test this idea , we define the `` mass offset '' at fixed temperature by the relation @xmath66",

    "these clusters are presented in figure [ fig : f13 ] with surface - brightness contours overplotted and with the associated values for  and @xmath73 .",
    "the two clusters in the left column appear more symmetric in their contours , while the two in the right column exhibit noticeable centroid shift .",
    "however , the morphologically apparent structure in the lower right cluster is not observed spectrally in the temperature ratio .",
    "evidently , neither morphology nor  is a perfect measure of relaxation in our simulation sample , as it contains clusters with small centroid shift @xmath82 and obvious substructure , as in the upper left of this figure . and",
    ", it contains clusters with large @xmath73 that are nearly isothermal , as in the lower right of this figure .",
    "we used a sample of galaxy clusters simulated with radiative cooling and supernova feedback , along with simulated  x - ray observations of these clusters , to study temperature inhomogeneity as a signature of cluster dynamical state .",
    "specifically , we adopted two methods of quantifying temperature inhomogeneity spectroscopically , the temperature ratio @xcite and the cool residual @xmath55 .",
    "the former is the ratio of a hardband x - ray spectral - fit temperature to a broadband temperature , and becomes greater than 1 for clusters whose icm contains cool , over - luminous sub - components .",
    "the latter is the excess broadband count rate relative to the count rate predicted by a model fit to the hard x - ray band .",
    "though our simulated clusters are typically less massive and have lower temperatures than the  archive clusters in @xcite , we find that their temperature ratios  occupy generally the same distribution as the observed clusters .",
    "we also looked for an opportunity to combine  and the cool residual with the mean mass - temperature relation to obtain better mass estimates than are achieved just with the scaling relation alone .",
    "we find , however , that while both  and the @xmath55 are correlated with offset from the  relation , these correlations are weak , at least for this sample .",
    "we conclude that these measures of temperature inhomogeneity are not very effective at reducing scatter in the mass - temperature relation .",
    "finally , we note a particular difficulty that arises when trying to use clusters from hydrodynamic simulations to calibrate scatter - correction observables based on temperature inhomogeneity , such as .",
    "historically , simulated clusters have tended to exhibit their own kind of `` over - cooling problem '' , in which dense lumps of luminous , cool gas associated with merged sub - halos appear .",
    "these cool lumps are often excised from simulated clusters before their global properties are measured , but masking them appears to make the remaining temperature structure of the simulated clusters overly homogeneous .",
    "this finding suggests that real clusters may have cooler sub - components , that are more diffuse and less concentrated than in their simulated counterparts . some physical process , perhaps thermal conduction , turbulent heat transport ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a more aggressive form of feedback , prevents cool lumps from forming in real clusters and might not completely eliminate those temperature inhomogeneities .",
    "newer simulations incorporate treatments of conduction and agn feedback , as well as more accurate treatments of mixing , and it will be interesting to revisit these temperature inhomogeneity measures in simulated clusters when large samples of such simulated clusters become available .",
