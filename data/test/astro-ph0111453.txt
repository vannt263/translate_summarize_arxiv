    "in this configuration , the brunt - visl  frequency is simply proportional to the radial distance .",
    "many mathematical results are known ( friedlander & siegmann 1982 ) concerning the shape of critical surfaces and characteristics of the governing mixed type operator .",
    "we confirm all these results by calculating the orbits of characteristics which propagate in the hyperbolic domain .",
    "in particular , we find that characteristics can be focused along attractors leading to associated singular velocity fields ( dintrans et al .",
    "we study , using the anelastic approximation , the low - frequency oscillations of a typical @xmath0-doradus star .",
    "hence , we show that dealing with rotation by the means of a second - order perturbative theory is not correct for rotation periods less than 3 days . using the same geometric formalism as above ( i.e. calculations of orbits of characteristics ) allows us to compute the frequencies of oscillations in the rapid rotation rgime ( rotation periods @xmath1 1 day ) .",
    "we find again that wave attractors are a common feature of rapidly rotating fluids and conclude that they are promising features for the transport of angular momentum and chemicals in the radiative zone of rotating stars ( dintrans & rieutord , 1999 ) ."
