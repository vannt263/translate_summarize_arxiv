    "we present a method for the numerical calculation of solutions to general hyperbolic partial differential equations ( pdes ) over the sphere that combines several existing techniques in novel ways .",
    "our motivating interest is the analysis of gravitational radiation in a neighbourhood of infinity via friedrich s conformal field equations @xcite , where it is convenient to regard space - time as the product of a @xmath1 dimensional lorentzian manifold and a euclidean @xmath1-sphere .",
    "the main difficulty for the numerical solution of problems in this geometric setting stems from the fact that @xmath2 can not be covered by a single chart .",
    "hence the coordinate description of fields inevitably breaks down .",
    "spectral methods avoid most of the problems caused by this as fields on @xmath2 are expressed as a sum of functions that form a well defined bases on the sphere . assuming that the properties of the functions in the sum are well understood",
    ", it is possible to avoid working directly with coordinate expressions that suffer from coordinate singularities . as an example , we mention the recent work of @xcite in the context of kerr space - time shows that indeed issues such as coordinate singularities and instability are avoided in such an approach , leading to accurate evolutions of dynamical equations . as a consequence we use a spectral method in what follows .    to implement our spectral method we choose to work with spin weighted spherical harmonics ( swshs ) and the associated @xmath3 and @xmath4 operators @xcite .",
    "swshs are a generalisation of scalar , vector and tensor harmonics on the sphere @xcite .",
    "swshs form an orthonormal basis for @xmath5 @xcite upon which the differential operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 act by raising and lowering spin - weight , respectively . in common with all spectral methods ,",
    "this reduces the action of differential operators to algebraic manipulations .",
    "this is a property which we exploit to reduce pdes to systems of coupled odes .    in order to apply swshs to a spectral evolution scheme it is necessary to decompose arbitrary fields on @xmath2 into a sum of swshs .",
    "many methods to do this have been proposed , since such decompositions are important for the analysis of data over the sphere , e.g.@xcite .",
    "we choose huffenberger and wandelt s method @xcite ( which is a modification of @xcite and @xcite ) for three reasons .",
    "firstly , the algorithm is theoretically exact if a minimum number of grid points are used .",
    "this is in contrast to several alternatives that are asymptotically exact in the limit of increasing numbers of grid points @xcite .",
    "secondly , the method can be applied simultaneously to functions of different spin weights . in our desired application",
    "we will be working with several functions each with different spin weights @xcite . as a consequence huffenberger and wandelt s method",
    "has reduced computational effort in comparison to a method which operates on each spin weighted function separately .",
    "thirdly , huffenberger and wandelt s method , via a clever mapping of the sphere into the @xmath1-torus allows for fast fourier transformations to be used , see also @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to spectral methods adapted to the non - periodic coordinate on @xmath2 , e.g.   @xcite .    in order to calculate the values of swshs over @xmath2 huffenberger and wandelt",
    "used a formula relating swshs to reduced wigner @xmath6-functions evaluated at @xmath7 .",
    "they implemented the calculation of these @xmath6-functions via the three term linear recursive relations given by risbo and trapani and navaza @xcite .",
    "trapani and navaza s scheme is both faster and more accurate than risbo s but eventually becomes unstable . to cope with this use a non - linear scheme that is equivalent to the scheme proposed by przeau and reinecke @xcite .",
    "we build a hybrid linear / non - linear recursion that avoids the numerical problems that both linear and non - linear recursive schemes suffer from , see sections [ sec : algodelcalc ] and [ sec : wdelstab ] .",
    "a similar hybrid scheme has been proposed by luscombe and luban @xcite for the calculation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 symbols . to the best of the authors knowledge",
    "neither the use of a hybrid scheme for the calculation of reduced wigner @xmath6-functions at @xmath7 nor the use of this method in swsh decompositions of functions over @xmath2 has been used before .",
    "the @xmath0 maxwell equations on a deformed sphere , section [ sec : maxcnstrct ] , have non - constant coefficients .",
    "we will therefore need to perform a swsh decomposition of products of swshs .",
    "this requires the calculation of clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "to do this we use a hybrid linear / non - linear recursion for @xmath8 symbols originally presented by luscome and luban s method @xcite to schulten and gordan s linear scheme @xcite . as",
    "before , to the best of the author s knowledge this is the first time a hybrid linear / non - linear scheme has been used for the calculation of clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "an alternative to the above explicit decomposition is to use spectral transformations directly to perform decompositions of products of swshs @xcite ( the pseudo - spectral approach ) .",
    "we use this approach to check for accuracy .",
    "it is our goal to provide a self - contained presentation , with consistent conventions , that may be readily adapted to general non - linear hyperbolic pdes using the outlined spectral method .",
    "wherever possible we present results for both integer and half - integer spin .",
    "this will provide a foundation for future extension to the half - integer spin case .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in  [ sec : geom ] we provide the geometric background appropriate for formulation of problems later in the work , in particular we review the construction of frames adapted for use with the @xmath3-formalism . in  [ sec : weightedquantities ] we explicitly show how an arbitrary smooth tensor field may be represented in terms of spin - weighted quantities on @xmath2 . in ",

    "@xmath41 can be represented as @xmath42 here we again consider @xmath11as being embedded into @xmath12 by @xmath13 , and the manifold @xmath2is thought of being given by @xmath43 in @xmath44 .",
    "when we introduce standard polar coordinates on @xmath2 , namely @xmath45 then @xmath19 obtains the particularly simple representation @xmath46 in particular , it becomes obvious that the push - forward of @xmath47 to @xmath2along @xmath19 vanishes .",
    "indeed , @xmath14 is the principal bundle over @xmath48 with structure group @xmath49 generated by @xmath47 ( whose integral curves are closed ) and projection map @xmath19 ; this is the _",
    "hopf bundle_.    the hopf bundle can be identified with the bundle of orthonormal frames on @xmath48 with respect to any smooth riemannian metric .",
    "an explicit construction in terms of the coordinates above can be done as follows .",
    "let @xmath50 be an open subset of @xmath48 ; we assume that the poles @xmath51 are outside of @xmath50 so that the representation of the hopf map given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : localhopf ] ) is well - defined and the euler coordinates cover @xmath52 .",
    "if we restrict to sufficiently small open subsets this is no loss of generality since for any sufficiently small choice of the open set @xmath50 we can always introduce the coordinates such that the poles are not in @xmath50 . let @xmath53 be a smooth orthonormal frame on @xmath50 and define the corresponding complex field @xmath54 we consider the action @xmath55 of @xmath56which is defined pointwise on @xmath50 , i.e.  the group parameter @xmath57 is a smooth function on @xmath50 . any specification of the function @xmath58 therefore yields another smooth orthonormal frame on @xmath50 and can hence be interpreted as the smooth local section @xmath59 in the bundle of orthonormal frames , or equivalently , in the hopf bundle . doing this for every open subset @xmath50 of @xmath48 ( introducing coordinates so that the poles are not in @xmath50 as above ) , the full bundle of orthonormal frames can be recovered and can therefore be identified with the hopf bundle . at every point @xmath60 of @xmath50 ,",

    "let @xmath63 be the dual coframe of @xmath64 and @xmath65 dual to @xmath66 .",

    "but under rotations of the frame , it gives rise to a unique function on @xmath52 which changes along the fiber according to the transformation of the frame .",
