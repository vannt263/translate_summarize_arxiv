    "several recent observations indicate a potential problem with the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario of structure formation in that they seem to contradict the numerically simulated density structure of cdm haloes .",
    "a first difficulty is posed by published rotation curves of dwarf galaxies , which often rise linearly from the centre to radii greater than @xmath2kpc .",
    "such a rise implies a constant - density core for the host dark - matter halo @xcite , and is in conflict with the central density cusps of the haloes found in @xmath3-body simulations , which are usually fitted by a double power - law profile with central logarithmic slope @xmath4 ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ; moore et al .",
    "a second problem is related to the large number of low - mass subclumps found orbiting within simulated galaxy - size haloes ; with a naive scaling to the observed properties of dwarf galaxies within the local group , the abundance of these subclumps appears too high by a factor of 10 to 50 @xcite .    a possible way to modify the cdm scenario to be compatible with these observations",
    "has recently been suggested by spergel & steinhardt .",
    "they propose a model where the dark matter is self - interacting but dissipationless .",
    "they argue that if the dark matter particles have a sufficiently large cross - section for elastic scattering , the strength of the central density concentration and the abundance of orbiting subclumps can both be reduced .",
    "collisions between dark matter particles would destroy the central cusps and lead to a gradual evaporation of small subclumps .",
    "self - interacting dark matter would also affect the structure of galaxy clusters , making them more nearly spherical and reducing the number of subclumps .",
    "these effects have been confirmed by several recent studies in which the halo properties in cosmological simulations of collisionless cold dark matter and self - interacting dark matter have been compared .",
    "for instance , yoshida et al . and dav et al . found that intermediate scattering cross sections for dark matter particles produce haloes which are less centrally concentrated than in a collisionless model and have smoother and more spherical cores .",
    "similar results have also been obtained by burkert , firmani et al .",
    "( 2000,2001 ) and kochanek & white , although they find different time scales for the onset of core collapse , which transforms intermediate flat cores into cores with density profiles @xmath5 .",
    "it is natural to ask how self - interacting dark matter would affect the strong gravitational lensing properties of galaxy clusters .",
    "strong lensing is a very powerful tool to probe the distribution of dark matter in cluster cores . from the location of multiple images of background sources lensed by a cluster",
    "one can obtain a detailed map of the mass distribution in the lens @xcite .",
    "the morphology of long arcs observed in the cluster fields yields important information on the core density @xcite .",
    "finally , the location of radial arcs can put strong constraints on the size and compactness of the lens cores ( e.g.  narayan & bartelmann 1997 ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to evaluate whether self - interacting dark - matter models are compatible with the observed ability of galaxy clusters to produce strong lensing events .",
    "some recent work has already addressed this issue .",
    "miralda - escud argued that the shallow cores produced by self - interacting dark matter could not agree with current observations of lensing by clusters .",
    "wyithe , turner & spergel studied simplified analytic models of self - interacting dark matter haloes and found large collision cross - sections to be incompatible with multiple imaging by clusters . in this paper",
    ", we address the issue by using ray - tracing through high resolution simulations to compute lensing cross sections for arcs of various types .",
    "we study a set of simulations designed to isolate the effect of collisions between dark matter particles on the structure of an individual cluster .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in section  [ method ]",
    "we describe the cluster models used in the simulations and present the numerical method adopted to compute the lensing properties .",
    "we present and discuss the results of our analysis in section  [ results ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are drawn in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the cluster models used in this study are those described in yoshida et al .",
    "( 2000a , b ) .",
    "they consist of a set of five different resimulations of the same cluster - sized halo , which is the second most massive object in the gif-@xmath6cdm simulation of kauffmann et al . .",
    "all simulations were performed with the gadget code ( springel , yoshida & white 2000 ) , in a flat model universe , with a matter density parameter @xmath7 and a cosmological constant of @xmath8 .",
    "the hubble constant is assumed to be @xmath9 .",
    "the cdm power spectrum was normalised so that the _ rms _ matter density fluctuations in spheres of radius @xmath10 is @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the value of @xmath13 in units of 100 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ) .",
    "the first cluster of the series ( hereafter called the s1 model ) is just a resimulation at higher resolution of the original gif-@xmath6cdm cluster , and was produced assuming standard collisionless dark matter .",
    "three other simulations ( hereafter called w - models ) were carried out introducing elastic scattering between cdm particles .",
    "this was accomplished by the monte - carlo method proposed by burkert , slightly modified by considering the pairwise velocity difference in evaluating the scattering probability instead of the one - point velocity dispersion .",
    "the three simulations differ in the value of the scattering cross section per unit mass @xmath14 : @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 were chosen .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to these models as s1wa , s1wb and s1wc , respectively , following the notation of yoshida et al . .",
    "finally , yoshida et al . also considered the extreme case in which dark matter particles are as strongly interacting as in the `` fluid '' limit ( see also moore et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this last simulation , the time evolution ,",
    "starting from the same initial conditions as in the collisionless original simulation , was followed solving the fluid equations with the sph technique . in the following",
    ", this model will be referred to as s1f .",
    "the resolution achieved in these simulations is quite high .",
    "most of them employ @xmath18 particles in the central , high - resolution region , where the particle mass is @xmath19 .",
    "the gravitational softening length is set to @xmath20 .",
    "all haloes have a similar final virial mass of @xmath21 .    for our lensing analysis",
    ", we picked the simulation snapshots at redshift @xmath22 because this is close to the most efficient redshift for strong gravitational lensing ( e.g.  bartelmann et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional density profiles of the five cluster models at this redshift are shown in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] .",
    "the general trends in the profiles follow our expectations . as the scattering cross section of the dark matter particles increases , the cluster density profile in the inner region of the halo flattens .",

    "the principal axis ratios of the five models , determined from the inertial tensors of the matter at densities exceeding 100 times the critical value , are listed in the third column of table  [ clusters ] .",
    "the values clearly show that the haloes are more spherically symmetric when the frequency of collisions between the dark matter particles increases . in the fourth column of table  [ clusters ] , we also report the core radius @xmath23 of the three haloes with self - interacting dark matter , which we define as the distance from the cluster centre where the surface density drops below half its central value . for models",

    "[ cols=\"<,>,^ , > \" , ]     [ crosssec ]    each cluster model provides six estimates of its strong - lensing cross sections , two for each projection since we performed simulations with two source distributions .",
    "we average all measurements in order to obtain the mean cross sections for each cluster model .",
    "the lensing cross sections of the five models are listed in tab .",
    "[ crosssec ] .",
    "models s1wb and s1wc have vanishing cross sections even for arcs satisfying condition @xmath26 , given that , as shown in fig .",
    "[ moments ] , they do not produce arcs with length - to - width ratio larger than @xmath27 .",
    "we find that model s1 has cross sections larger than model s1wa .",
    "in particular , the cross sections @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the first model are more than one order of magnitude larger than those of the second .",
    "this feature suggests that a galaxy cluster consisting even of very weakly interacting dark matter should produce at least ten times fewer giant arcs than one made of collisionless particles .",
    "compared to the other models , s1f has very large cross sections , in agreement with the results shown earlier .    as a consequence of the lower curvature in the effective lensing potential ,",
    "arcs produced by flatter profiles tend to be more strongly magnified . however , the corresponding change in the magnification bias is expected to have a very small effect on the previous results for two reasons .",
    "first , such arcs would then be very thick , while the observed ones are generally thin and sometimes unresolved in the radial direction even when observed from space .",
    "second , the magnification bias depends on the colour selection , because the number - count slope does , and unless only very blue or very red objects are selected , the bias is negligible for arcs .    a comparison of the cross sections listed in tab .",
    "[ crosssec ] for the collisionless simulation ( s1 ) shows that the cluster almost exactly reproduces the average cross section found in the cluster sample used by bartelmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for a lens redshift of @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , we checked whether different realisations of the same cluster had comparable large - arc cross sections .",
    "to do so , we took the cluster mass distributions at different output redshifts ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) and computed their lensing properties when placed at a redshift of @xmath30 . for the given cosmological parameters , the linear growth factor changes by less than @xmath34 between redshifts @xmath30 and @xmath33 , so that the effect of cluster growth is unimportant .",
    "we find only a modest growth in the large - arc cross sections when using the cluster mass distributions at redshifts @xmath35 and @xmath32 . between redshift @xmath32 and @xmath33 , however , the cluster undergoes a merger event with a clump of @xmath36 and subsequent relaxation , which increases its central density and therefore also the large - arc cross section .",
    "the effect of the merger on the lensing cross section is larger for the collisional than for the collisionless model . the infalling clump increases surface mass density and shear .",
    "since the surface density profile of the collisional cluster is flatter than that of the collisionless cluster , this increase in lensing efficiency affects a larger region in the cluster centre .",
    "while the ratio between the large - arc cross sections between the s1 and s1wa models is roughly an order of magnitude during quiescent periods , it is reduced to approximately five during the merger event . for similar reasons ,",
    "it is important to mention that the presence of a dominant central galaxy could affect our different models in different ways , being more effective on top of the flatter models . as a consequence",
    ", the differences between collisional and collisionless cases could be reduced .",
    "a detailed study of this effect is in progress .",
    "nonetheless , we can conclude ( 1 ) that the chosen cluster is typical for clusters in the @xmath6cdm cosmology , and ( 2 ) that the large - arc cross section for the mildly collisional model s1wa falls substantially below that of the collisionless model s1 for different realisations of the same cluster .      in this subsection , we analyse the capability of our models to produce radial arcs .",
    "such arcs have been observed in several galaxy clusters .",
    "for instance , two radial arcs exist in the core of ms  0440 @xcite . from x - ray observations ,",
    "the mass of this cluster within @xmath37 was estimated to be @xmath38 , which is similar to that of the cluster we analyse here .",
    "the appearance of radial arcs and their position within the lensing cluster depend on both the slope of the projected mass profile and on the central density of the lens .",
    "the surface density must surpass a critical value in order for the radial critical curve to appear where the eigenvalue @xmath39 of the jacobian matrix is zero .",
    "moreover , the steeper the density profile is , the closer to the centre the radial arcs tend to move @xcite .",
    "the observed location of radial arcs close to the cluster mass centres suggests that the core radii of the host clusters must be quite small @xcite . due to the different slopes of the density profiles of the cluster models",
    ", we thus expect to find quite large differences in their capacity to form radial arcs ( see e.g. molikawa & hattori 2000 ) .",
    "the radial magnification @xmath40 at each point of the lens plane is given by the inverse of the radial eigenvalue of the jacobian lensing matrix , @xmath41 . from the convergence and the shear , computed as explained in sect .",
    "[ lp ] , we obtain @xmath40 at each of the @xmath42 grid points of the lens plane . we show in fig .",
    "[ radhist ] how these radial magnifications are distributed for the five cluster models .",
    "each histogram combines contributions from all three projections of each cluster .",
    "as can be noted , values of @xmath40 exceeding @xmath43 are reached only by models s1 and s1f , while models s1wa , s1wb and s1wc can only produce weak radial distortions .    using the tangential and radial eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix , we can also identify the radial arcs from the complete sample of distorted images , and this enables us to compute the lensing cross sections for radial arcs . for their automatic detection",
    ", we assumed that radial arcs must lie on the radial critical curve or very close to it .",
    "therefore , we searched those images containing at least one pixel for which the radial eigenvalue is @xmath44 and the tangential eigenvalue is @xmath45 .",
    "these values were chosen in order to avoid misclassifications of radial arcs .",
    "the cross sections for radial arcs , @xmath46 , averaged over the six simulations performed for each cluster , are listed in the fifth column of table  [ crosssec ] .",
    "we found that only models s1 and s1f are able to produce radial arcs , while the w - models are not .",
    "the results for model s1wa are particularly interesting because this cluster seems to have a sufficiently high surface density to produce giant arcs , but not enough to radially distort the background galaxies .",
    "our results show that models s1wb and s1wc can not produce long and thin arcs at all . although the mass of these clusters is already fairly large , we have checked whether an even more massive cluster with density profile similar to that of s1wb could efficiently form this kind of arcs . to this end , we rescaled the cluster mass by a variable factor @xmath47 .",
    "the virial radius @xmath48 of a halo scales as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the virial mass of the halo . to obtain a halo of mass @xmath51 which is dynamically stable , we also need to rescale distances by a factor @xmath52 .",
    "this means that , while the three - dimensional density @xmath53 remains fixed , the halo surface density is enhanced by a factor @xmath52 . for this reason",
    "we expect that , increasing its mass , cluster s1wb will eventually become able to produce strong lensing effects .",
    "we therefore perform a new set of lensing simulations , choosing mass scaling factors @xmath54 equal to 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ rescaled ] the cross sections of these rescaled clusters , as a function of the rescaling factor @xmath54 . in this plot , upper , middle and lower panels refer to the lensing cross section for length - to - width ratios larger than 5 , 7 , and 10 , respectively .",
    "the dashed and dotted horizontal lines correspond to the equivalent cross sections for models s1 and s1wa .",
    "we can infer from this figure that a cluster with the same density profile as our model s1wb must have a mass of at least @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) times larger than the mass of our present cluster , in order to achieve the same strong lensing efficiency of model s1 ( s1wa ) .    in the same spirit",
    ", we also rescale the mass of cluster s1wa , to determine when it starts producing radial arcs .",
    "we multiply the cluster mass by a factor of two and found that only one out of three projections of the rescaled cluster was efficient in forming radial arcs .",
    "however , the cross section of the rescaled cluster , @xmath57 , is still one order of magnitude lower than that of model s1 .",
    "finally let us comment that our method to rescale the clusters is approximate .",
    "in fact , rescaling the mass should in principle affect the collision rate .",
    "yoshida et al .  ( 2000b ) estimated the number of collisions between dark matter particles per hubble time as @xmath58 , where @xmath53 is the three - dimensional density and @xmath59 is the particle velocity .",
    "since @xmath60 , the number of collisions would increase by a factor @xmath61 when the cluster mass is rescaled by a factor @xmath54 .",
    "since our rescaling technique keeps @xmath62 constant while the cluster mass is increased by a factor @xmath54 , the result practically corresponds to an effective @xmath63 reduced by a factor @xmath61 .",
    "this means that we are even over - estimating the lensing efficiency of the @xmath54-scaled clusters and our previous conclusions can be considered conservative .",
    "self - interacting dark matter was suggested as a solution to the problems ( 1 ) that dwarf galaxies are observed to have flat cores , while they should have density cusps according to @xmath3-body simulations , and ( 2 ) that simulations tend to produce more substructure in galaxies than there seems to be . in essence , the dark - matter self - interaction flattens density cusps , increases radial symmetry , and damps substructure ; all of which are ` desired ' effects .",
    "however , it was shown before that asymmetries , steep density profiles , and existence of substructures are essential for the ability of galaxy clusters to produce pronounced strong - lensing features like large arcs .",
    "this is due to several reasons .",
    "first , lenses need to exceed the critical surface mass density in order to form critical curves , which are mandatory for large arcs .",
    "second , asymmetries in lenses increase the gravitational tidal field , or shear , which helps to make them critical for multiple imaging .",
    "asymmetric clusters can be critical at lower surface mass densities than symmetric clusters .",
    "third , observed arcs are generally thin , i.e.  little magnified or even demagnified in the radial direction .",
    "for this to be the case , the surface mass density needs to be lower than about half the critical surface density at the location of the arcs .",
    "together with the requirement that the surface density be supercritical in lens centres , this implies that density profiles have to be steep .    in other words ,",
    "the introduction of self - interaction between dark - matter particles is expected to have a pronounced , potentially ` undesirable ' impact on the ability of clusters to produce large arcs : it is exactly the desired effect of the self - interaction , namely to make clusters flatter , rounder , and smoother , that on the other hand threatens to destroy their strong - lensing capabilities . in this paper",
    ", we have investigated this effect on the second - most massive cluster in a cosmological @xmath6cdm simulation , and produced the following results :    * the introduction of self - interaction even with a small cross section of @xmath64 reduces the cluster cross section for the production of large arcs by about an order of magnitude compared to the collisionless case . * upon further increase of the interaction cross section , the cluster becomes entirely uncritical and can not produce arcs any more , despite the otherwise favourable conditions in terms of cluster mass and redshift . * the cross section for radial arcs vanishes even for the smallest interaction cross section considered .",
    "* the cluster with an interaction cross section of @xmath65 would require about five times more mass to reach the cross section for large tangential arcs of the cluster with @xmath64 , and about @xmath66 times more mass to restore the cross section of the collisionless cluster .",
    "due to the steepness of the cluster mass function , the spatial number density of such clusters at the redshift considered is more than six orders of magnitude smaller than that of the original cluster . *",
    "the strong - lensing cross section of the cluster model investigated here is almost identical to the average cross section found in a sample of clusters simulated earlier in the @xmath6cdm cosmology ( bartelmann et al .",
    "also , the cross sections obtained do not change significantly when the cluster model is taken at different output times and placed at the original lens redshift of @xmath67 .    at a length - to - width ratio of @xmath68 ,",
    "the abundance of observed arcs brighter than @xmath69 is @xmath70 per cluster with x - ray luminosity @xmath71 . extrapolated to the whole sky , there should be @xmath72 such arcs .",
    "numerically simulated clusters in a ( cluster - normalised ) @xmath6cdm model fall short by about an order of magnitude of producing this number of arcs ( bartelmann et al .",
    "it may be possible that massive central cluster galaxies can increase the arc optical depth of @xmath6cdm clusters sufficiently to reconcile it with observations ( williams et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , a further reduction of the strong - lensing cross section by an order of magnitude due to even mild dark - matter interaction seems problematic in view of the observed arc abundance .    although the inability to produce radial arcs of the clusters with interacting dark matter is a potentially important piece of information , it is currently impossible to draw any firm conclusions from comparisons with data .",
    "radial arcs have so far been reported in five galaxy clusters ( ms  2137 , fort et al .",
    "1992 ; a  370 , smail et al .  1996",
    "; ms  0440 , gioia et al .  1998 ; ac  114 , natarajan et al .  1998 ; a  383 , smith et al .",
    "2000 ) , all of which are located near bright galaxies in the cluster centre . it is currently unclear what exactly the influence of the galaxies on the occurrence of the radial arc is , and how the presence of luminous galaxies near cluster centres prevents the detection of more radial arcs .",
    "a statistical comparison of predicted and observed radial - arc numbers therefore appears premature . in principle",
    ", the ratio of the clustercentric distances of radial and tangential arcs could be used to constrain the cluster density profile , but in practice at least redshift estimates of the arc sources would have to be available .    of course , our simulations are insufficient for statistically sound statements on the total arc cross section of a given cluster population .",
    "however , given the massive impact of dark - matter interaction even with the smallest cross section considered , we conclude that the dark - matter self - interaction hypothesis may be in severe conflict with the abundance of large arcs unless the interaction cross section is very small .",
