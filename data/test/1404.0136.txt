    "in the solar system , there are many small bodies such as asteroids and comets .",
    "since these small astronomical objects could keep the ancient information of the history of the solar system , a lot of efforts have been devoted to investigations of these objects so far  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , the asteroid itokawa was explored by the japanese space craft _ hayabusa _ from september 2005 .",
    "the exploration uncovered the details of itokawa s surface terrain .",
    "itokawa is covered by various sizes of granular matter such as regolith , pebbles , and boulders  @xcite .",
    "moreover , migrations and sorting of the regolith could occur on the surface of itokawa  @xcite , although the surface gravity of itokawa is extremely low .",
    "impact craters located on the surface of itokawa were very subtle , i.e. , they show indistinct morphologies  @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the erasure of the craters by seismic shaking  @xcite .",
    "in addition , tiny samples returned from itokawa allow us to analyze the detail of its history .",
    "@xcite revealed that itokawa s surface grains are relatively young in terms of cosmic - rays exposure .",
    "the estimated age is approximately eight million years . besides , using x - ray microtomography ,  @xcite found that some particles had rounded edges .",
    "all these facts suggest that the surface of itokawa would be active and continue to be renewed until recently",
    ". one possible explanation of such young surface is the regolith convection caused by impact - induced seismic shaking .",
    "although the direct measurement of the seismic wave has not been achieved , @xcite and @xcite studied the possibility of global seismic shaking of asteroid eros in order to explain its surface modification processes .",
    "they built a model of seismic shaking by considering the attenuating diffusion of the seismic wave .",
    "@xcite partially applied the model to the asteroid itokawa and showed that the global regolith convection might occur even by small - scale impacts . to unlock the regolith grains network supported by gravity , the maximum acceleration induced by the seismic shaking has to be greater than the gravitational acceleration .",
    "@xcite revealed that this criterion can be satisfied by a small - scale impact since the gravity on the surface of itokawa @xmath3 is very small , @xmath4 m / s@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the earth s gravitational acceleration , @xmath6 m / s@xmath5 .",
    "the evaluation is still qualitative since they only assessed the onset criterion of the regolith convection .",
    "while the quantitative assessment of the convective velocity is necessary to discuss the feasibility of the regolith convection , there have been very few such studies .",
    "granular convection can be generally observed in a granular matter under the mechanical vibration . when a granular matter is subjected to a steady vertical vibration , granular convection",
    "is readily induced .",
    "if the vibrated granular matter is polydisperse , the size segregation of grains occurs usually in vertical direction .",
    "this vibration - induced size segregation is called brazil nut effect ( bne ) .",
    "the bne can be caused by the granular convection  @xcite .",
    "this means that the grains can be migrated and sorted simultaneously by vibration .",
    "although the regolith convection accompanied by migration and sorting seems to be a natural outcome of global seismic shaking , the scaling approach to the granular convective velocity is needed to discuss the consistency between regolith convection and observational data such as surface age of the asteroid .",
    "therefore , we experimentally measure and scale the velocity of granular convection in this study , as a first - step approach to this problem .    fundamental nature of granular convection itself is an intriguing problem .",
    "the granular convection has long been studied both by experiments  @xcite and numerical simulations  @xcite . the onset of granular convection depends on the maximum acceleration of the applied vibration .",
    "if the maximum acceleration is less than the gravitational acceleration , any granular convection does not occur at all  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 , which represents the balance between the maximum vibrational acceleration and the gravitational acceleration @xmath1 , has been used to characterize the behavior of granular convection .",
    "@xmath7 is defined as , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vibration amplitude and @xmath10 is the frequency .    in this study ,",
    "the scaling method is applied to the analysis of granular convective velocity .",
    "we are interested in asteroidal - scale granular convection while the actual experiment is limited within the laboratory scale .",
    "in such a situation , the scaling is the only way to derive a meaningful quantitative relation . in the scaling analysis ,",
    "dimensionless parameters such as @xmath7 are useful since they do not depend on the system of unit .",
    "the weak point of the scaling analysis is its arbitrariness .",
    "of course , @xmath7 is one of the most important dimensionless parameters to discuss the vibrated granular matter .",
    "however , the choice of the important dimensionless parameter is not unique .",
    "specifically , another dimensionless parameter called shaking parameter @xmath11 was firstly introduced by  @xcite and recently used to describe the transitions among the granular leidenfrost , bouncing bed , undulations , convection , and so on  @xcite .",
    "particularly , @xmath11 is relevant to characterize a strongly shaken shallow granular convection  @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 is defined as , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the constitutive grains diameter .",
    "@xmath11 denotes the balance between the squared vibrational velocity and the squared gravitational velocity .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 can be also obtained by the natural non - dimensionalization of the granular - hydrodynamic model for the strongly shaken granular convection  @xcite . using the aforementioned dimensionless parameters",
    ", we would like to find a useful scaling relation between granular convective velocity , the gravitational acceleration , and other parameters .",
    "therefore , we carry out a systematic laboratory experiments of the vibration - induced granular convection",

    "one minute pre - vibration is applied before each experimental realization .",
    "this means that we measure the steady granular convection .",
    "while the actual impact - induced regolith convection might be transient , we have to concentrate on the steady convection to eliminate the memory effect .",
    "the frame rate is fixed at @xmath32 fps and spatial resolution of the image ranges from @xmath33 @xmath34m / pixel to @xmath35 @xmath34m / pixel depending on the experimental conditions .",

    "another example of the missing parameters is the cohesive force among grains .",

    "we also think that the gravitational force is more dominant than the electrostatic force for the bulk convective motion of glass beads .",

    "the detailed study for the effect of friction is a very important future problem .",
    "the origin of granular convection in the current experiment is plausibly the effect of wall . as already mentioned , the structure of the convective roll changes spontaneously when @xmath10 or @xmath15 are varied",
    "this implies that there is an inherent length scale in the granular convection .",
    "however , the wall effect to the velocity scaling is still significant even in split ( doubled ) roll state since we observe the grains motion on the wall .",

    "nevertheless , astronomical objects obviously maintain their own shapes without any wall .",
    "it is hard to eliminate the container wall effect in usual granular experiments even in microgravity environment .",
    "rather , highly heterogenous structure of small asteroids might work as an effective wall which triggers the granular convection .",

    "and the deep region of the vibrated granular matter is almost at rest .",
    "if this peculiar regime called _ frozen zone _ presents in the real asteroids convection , the regolith migration occurs only within a shallow region . in the current experiment ,",
    "most of velocity profiles do not show the clear frozen zone .",
    "the convective velocity decays calmly as typically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot](b ) .",
    "thus the convective velocity is simply scaled by @xmath86 with the nontrivial exponent @xmath102 .",
    "if the frozen zone is clearly observed , the convective velocity would be saturated at a certain @xmath83 , and it can not be simply scaled by a single exponent . actually , the frozen zone can be partially observed also in the current experiment under small @xmath7 , large @xmath10 , and large @xmath83 conditions .",
    "since we are interested in the principal flow velocity of the granular convection , we have focused only on the axisymmetric convective state and its maximum velocity @xmath58 , in this study .",
    "detailed analysis of @xmath46 profile is a next important step to reveal the granular convection dynamics that relates to the depth of regolith convection occurring in small astronomical objects .",
    "so far , the scaling form for the granular convective velocity has been discussed on the basis of systematically performed experimental results . in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the implication of the obtained scaling law .",
    "the scaling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sl_scaling ] ) can be rewritten by considering its physical meaning .",
    "then the scaling is compared with a recent experimental result of two - dimensional granular convection .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : sl_scaling ] ) can be transformed into a following form , @xmath103 this form is more understandable than eq .",
    "( [ eq : sl_scaling ] ) .",
    "the representative velocity @xmath58 is expressed by a power law product of two characteristic velocities : gravitational @xmath104 and vibrational @xmath105 .",
    "in addition , the system size dependence is scaled by the last factor @xmath106 .",
    "the scaling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) is qualitatively consistent with a recent experiment performed by  @xcite .",
    "they investigated the convective - driven bne and found that the convective velocity linearly depends on @xmath105 .",
    "to better explain the experimental data , the use of @xmath105 was much better than @xmath7 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) , convective velocity depends on vibrational velocity as , @xmath107 .",
    "these two experimental results show a good agreement . however , they reported the presence of critical vibrational velocity below which the granular convection was not induced .",
    "this critical vibrational velocity probably corresponds to the onset criterion . in the current analysis",
    ", however , we do not clearly confirm this offset in the scaling ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sl_scaling ] ) .",
    "instead , we varied @xmath11 over two orders of magnitude to obtain the power - law relation .",
    "the range of @xmath11 and other parameters were relatively narrow in the study of @xcite since they are not interested in the scale - free form .",
    "thus they reported the linear relation between the convective velocity and the vibrational velocity . on the other hand",
    ", we obtain the scaling ( power law ) relation between the convective velocity , the vibrational velocity , and the gravitational velocity .",
    "it should be noted that the system size dependence of the scaling is bounded . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) , the value of @xmath58 can be very large when @xmath108 becomes large .",
    "this condition corresponds to a large @xmath109 or a small @xmath13 case . at the limit of @xmath110 or @xmath111",
    ", @xmath58 diverges .",
    "however , such a divergence does not occur in the actual granular convection .",
    "the convective roll size can not grow to the infinitely large size .",
    "in fact , we experimentally observed the split of the convective roll ( double toroidal - roll ) in a very shallow layer , although such a split rarely happened .",
    "this preliminary observation indicates that there might be an intrinsic length scale which determines the maximum convective roll size .",
    "since the current experimental system size is limited , it is hard to systematically reveal the effect of this intrinsic length scale . at a small @xmath13 regime ,",
    "on the other hand , the cohesive force among grains becomes dominant instead of the gravitational force .",
    "the current scaling form can not be applied to such a situation .",
    "the detailed investigation on the size - dependent scaling form for more widely spreading size regime is an important future problem . to investigate the small @xmath13 regime ,",
    "the experiment under the vacuum condition is also necessary .",
    "finally , the experimentally obtained scaling is cast into a form in which the gravity effect can be directly evaluated .",
    "since the interpretation of scaling is not unique in general , we have to take a special care for its understanding . whereas the discussion in this subsection is speculative , the result is consistent with other related works .",
    "moreover , the obtained scaling includes various parameters such as vibration frequency and system size .",
    "thus the form is very efficient to estimate the timescale of regolith convection occurring on the surface of small asteroid .",
    "recently , some granular flow experiments were performed under microgravity conditions created by parabolic flights  @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a taylor - couette geometry and measured both sheared and convective flows induced by the shearing .",
    "particularly , @xcite reported the effect of gravity to the sheared granular convection .",
    "they claimed that the gravity plays an essential role to make a stiff grains network in a bulk granular matter .",
    "such a grains network is necessary to transform a shear stress into a driving force of the convective motion .",
    "therefore , the granular convective velocity under the microgravity became almost zero .",
    "moreover , the convective velocity under the high - gravity condition became large  @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured the rising velocity of intruders in convective - driven bne under the reduced gravity .",
    "they found that the rising velocity is almost linearly scaled by the gravity .    to compare the current result with above - mentioned microgravity experiments ,",
    "here we evaluate the gravity influence to the convective velocity based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) . at a glance of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) , the convective velocity is scaled as @xmath112 .",
    "this scaling implicitly assumes the fixed @xmath105 under different @xmath1 environment .",
    "this assumption is not practical to estimate the granular convective velocity induced under the different @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , under the microgravity environment , very small vibrational acceleration is enough to satisfy the onset criterion of granular convection ( @xmath113 ) . however , if @xmath105 is fixed to consider the granular convective velocity under the microgravity environment , the corresponding @xmath7 becomes extremely large .",
    "it is not a realistic assumption . instead",
    ", the value of @xmath7 should be fixed to estimate the convective velocity by means of similarity law .",
    "in fact , fixed @xmath7 was used to discuss the possibility of convection on the surface of itokawa  @xcite . @xcite",
    "also fixed @xmath7 to discuss @xmath1 dependence .",
    "therefore , the typical vibrational velocity should be written as @xmath114 instead of @xmath105 .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) can be modified into the following form , @xmath115 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) , @xmath58 depends on @xmath1 as , @xmath116 .",
    "the value @xmath117 is close to unity .",
    "this result is qualitatively similar to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , note that we do not directly vary the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence is indirectly deduced from the scaling . besides , the convective motion of  @xcite was induced by shear in a taylor - couette cell . thus the similarity is rather qualitative .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) and a model of seismic shaking induced by impacts  @xcite , we are able to estimate the convective velocity for various astronomical objects .",
    "to do that , we have to be careful in the estimate of @xmath106 .",
    "whereas its value strongly affects the estimate of @xmath58 , it is still very uncertain",
    ". then it might be possible to evaluate the surface age ( resurfacing timescale ) of the microgravity asteroid by considering the population of impactors .",
    "such an estimate for itokawa or eros is an interesting application of this scaling .",
    "this topic is a part of ongoing investigation .",
    "an experimental study of the granular convection was performed with a vertically shaken glass beads bed .",
    "the maximum convective velocity @xmath58 was measured by piv method .",
    "although the @xmath58 was measured on the wall , we assume that it corresponds to a representative value of the convective velocity .",
    "the normalized convective velocity @xmath118 was scaled by the shaking parameter @xmath119 and the dimensionless system size @xmath108 .",
    "the obtained scaling ( eq  ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) ) indicates that the representative convective velocity can be written as a certain power - law product of the vibrational velocity @xmath105 , the gravitational velocity @xmath104 , and the dimensionless system size @xmath86 .",
    "this experimentally obtained scaling law is qualitatively consistent with other previous studies of granular convection or bne . using the scaling law",
    ", one can roughly estimate the convective velocity for various vibrational conditions , in principle . since the gravitational acceleration and frictional properties",
    "are not varied in this experiment , applicability of the current result toward actual regolith migration might be still limited .",
    "systematic further studies have to be carried out to unveil the regolith migration dynamics owing to the granular convection .",
