    "roughly half of the known short - period black - hole binaries have low - mass companions ( lee , brown & wijers 2002 ) .",
    "however , it has been realized for more than a decade now that such systems are difficult to form ( see the discussion in podsiadlowski , rappaport & han 2003 [ prh ] and further references therein ) .",
    "the problem is that , in order to produce a short - period system ( i.e. , @xmath4 hrs ) with a low - mass donor star , the progenitor system has to pass through a common - envelope ( ce ) phase where the binary s period is reduced from a typical period of several years to less than a few days . in the standard model for ce evolution ( paczyski 1976 )",
    ", this requires that the orbital energy released in the spiral - in process is sufficient to eject the massive envelope of the primary . for a low - mass companion ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) , this is energetically difficult , if not impossible , in particular considering the large binding energies of the massive envelope of the primaries ( dewi & tauris 2001 ; prh ) .",
    "this problem has led to the suggestion of a number of more exotic formation scenarios for low - mass black - hole binaries , e.g. , involving a triple scenario ( eggleton & verbunt 1986 ) or the formation of the companion from a disrupted envelope ( podsiadlowski , cannon & rees 1995 ; prh ) . alternatively",
    ", the low - mass black - hole binaries could descend from intermediate - mass systems ( justham , rappaport & podsiadlowski 2006 ) , as is the case for the majority of low - mass neutron - star binaries ( pfahl , rappaport & podsiadlowski 2003 ) . in this paper",
    ", we present a new mechanism for the ejection of the common envelope : `` explosive common - envelope ejection '' , involving nuclear rather than orbital energy , which can be highly efficient in ejecting a massive envelope even if the companion is a relatively low - mass star .    a particularly interesting black - hole binary is the well studied system gro j165540 ( nova scorpii 1994 ) .",
    "it has an orbital period of 2.6d and a black hole with a mass @xmath6 ( beer & podsiadlowski 2002 ) .",
    "israelian et al .  ( 1999 ) claimed that the secondary in this system has been highly enriched with the products of explosive nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , mg , si , s , ti ) produced in the supernova explosion that produced the black hole . based on the actual abundance ratios , podsiadlowski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found some tentative evidence that these are better explained by an energetic supernova explosion , a hypernova , with a typical ejecta energy of @xmath7ergs ( i.e. , 10 times the energy in a ` typical ' supernova ) .",
    "this may suggest that the formation of the black hole in this system could have been accompanied by a long - duration gamma - ray burst ( lgrb ) .",
    "however , in this case it is puzzling why the black - hole progenitor would have been rapidly rotating as required in the collapsar model for lgrbs ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) since the core of the primary should have been spun down rather than have been spun up during its evolution ( heger , woosley & spruit 2005 ) . as we will show later in this paper , in the case of explosive ce ejection , this problem does not arise , possibly linking the formation of compact black - hole binaries having low - mass secondaries to lgrbs .",
    "this process of explosive ce was discovered in a systematic study of the slow merger of massive stars ( ivanova 2002 ; ivanova & podsiadlowski 2003 ; ivanova & podsiadlowski 2010 ) , where it was found that , in some cases in the late stage of the spiral - in process , hydrogen - rich material could be mixed into the helium - burning shell leading to a thermonuclear runaway which released enough energy to eject both the hydrogen and the helium envelope ( see figure  1 for a schematic representation ) , possibly explaining why to date all supernovae associated with lgrbs appear to be type ic supernovae ( i.e. , supernovae without hydrogen and helium in their spectrum ; cf .",
    "podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will first discuss the numerical method in section  2 , and the physics of the process of explosive ce ejection in section  3 . in section",
    "4 we apply it to the formation of low - mass black - hole binaries and lgrbs , and end with a broader discussion in section  5 .",
    "to model the merging of the two stars , we used a modified one - dimensional henyey - type stellar evolution code ( based on kippenhahn , weigert & hofmeister 1967 ) , which has recently been updated ( podsiadlowski , rappaport & pfahl 2002 ) .",
    "it uses opal opacities ( rogers & iglesias 1992 ) , supplemented by molecular opacities from alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) at low temperatures and a mixing - lenth parameter @xmath8 .",
    "following the calibration by schrder , pols & eggleton ( 1997 ) and pols et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we generally assume 0.25 pressure scale heights of convective overshooting , unless stated otherwise .    in the calculation of the spiral - in and merger phase we followed the angular - momentum transport in the envelope of the primary , using prescriptions similar to those given by heger & langer ( 1998 ) , where the source of the angular momentum is the orbital decay of the immersed binary .",
    "this is important for determining the averaged distribution of the heating sources inside the common envelope .",
    "the envelope heating is provided by the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the differentially rotating shells due to viscous friction .",
    "note that this energy is not necessarily released in the same place where the angular momentum has been deposited initially . for modelling the latter",
    ", we included a prescription that simulates the frictional energy input during the spiral - in phase of the companion star similar to the prescription given by meyer & meyer - hofmeister ( 1979 ) ( also see podsiadlowski 2001 ) .",
    "once the immersed secondary fills its own critical potential surface ( i.e. , its equivalent `` roche lobe '' defined by the effective potential of the core - secondary pair ) within the common envelope , we simulate the mass transfer guided by the detailed stream ",
    "core simulations presented in ivanova , podsiadlowski & spruit ( 2002 ) .",
    "we use their equation ( 28 ) to determine the depth to which the stream penetrates the hydrogen - exhausted core of the primary and vary the parameter @xmath9 to take into account uncertainties in the modelling of the stream  core impact .",
    "defines the stream penetration efficiency and depends on the amount of entropy that is generated in the stream ",
    "core impact : a larger @xmath9 corresponds to the case where the ambient medium near the core has a larger pressure and temperature gradient resulting in the generation of stronger shocks and faster dissipation of the stream . ]    in each time step , we determine how much mass is lost from the secondary and deposit this material with the appropriate entropy at the bottom of the stream . in this phase , the mass - transfer rate from the secondary is still determined by the frictional angular - momentum loss the immersed binary experiences , and reaches up to 100m@xmath10yr@xmath3 in the final phase .",
    "since hydrogen is deposited in layers with temperatures @xmath11k , an extended nuclear reaction network , including all important weak interactions , is included using the reaclib library ( thielemann , truran & arnould 1986 ) .",
    "this library provides the data for reaction rates which can be applied for a wide range of temperatures ( @xmath12k ) for all elements up to @xmath13kr . for heavier elements",
    ", the library has been updated for neutron - capture cross - sections and half - lifes of beta - decays for the s - elements from @xmath14rb up to @xmath15bi .",
    "the data for these cross - sections were taken from the work of beer , voss and winters ( 1992 ) and have been interpolated using the method of minimal squares to fit the formulae for reaction rates used in reaclib .",
    "the data for the half lives of the beta - decays were taken from newman ( 1978 ) .",
    "we note that , in explosive phases , the nuclear timescales of many reactions are shorter than the convective turnover timescales in convective regions , and thus the assumption of homogeneous mixing in the convective layers is not valid . to treat the time - dependent nuclear burning in convective zones",
    ", we therefore use a modified version of the two - stream formalism developed by cannon ( 1993 ) .",
    "to explore the conditions for explosive common - envelope ejection , we performed a detailed numerical study of the merger of a 18@xmath17 primary with secondaries in the range of 15@xmath17 . in all cases",
    ", we assumed that the spiral - in phase started when the primary had completed helium core burning and was ascending the red - supergiant branch for the second time ( so - called case c mass transfer ; lauterborn 1970 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the results of a typical calculation which illustrates the evolution from the initial spiral - in phase to the point at which the envelope is ejected . to test the effects of convective overshooting",
    ", we used models with 0.25 pressure scale heights of convective overshooting and models without convective overshooting , where the former produces a h - exhausted core of 6.8@xmath17 , 1.3@xmath17 larger than the latter . to examine the uncertainties due the modelling of the stream ",
    "core interaction , we use two different parameters for the entropy generation in equation  ( 28 ) of ivanova et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , @xmath18 for low - entropy generation and @xmath19 for high - entropy generation .",
    "we note that , in the present study , we did not model how rotation of the core affects the penetration depth ( see section 5.3.2 of ivanova et al .  [ 2002 ] ) and how this changes during the stream  core interaction phase .",
    "we do not expect that this would change our conclusions significantly .          at the end of the spiral - in",
    ", when the secondary starts to fill its roche lobe within the common envelope , the secondary itself is located partially within the outer convective zone ( ocz ) of the primary , although the inner lagrangian point , @xmath20 , is within the radiative zone . the layer of envelope material at the position of the secondary has expanded because of the frictional energy input from the spiral - in and has a density roughly two orders of magnitude less than before the spiral - in , with a typical range from about @xmath21 to about @xmath22 .",
    "the spiral - in does not affect the structure of the primary s core ( the co core plus the surrounding he shell ) , it only affects the structure of the radiative hydrogen zone between the ocz and the he shell ( @xmath23 ) , since the upper part of this zone has been heated and may have become convective .",
    "for example , in the case of a 5@xmath17 donor inside an 18@xmath17 primary , the total mass of the ocz is increased by @xmath24 , while , in the case of a @xmath25 donor , it is only increased by @xmath26 .",
    "it should be noted that , in the first case , the initial @xmath23 is 0.13@xmath17 for our standard case with convective overshooting . without convective overshooting , it would be @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding radial sizes of this zone ( @xmath28 ) are @xmath29 cm and @xmath30 cm for the case with and without convective overshooting , respectively .",
    "once the stream leaves the secondary , the depth of its penetration depends on the initial entropy of the stream material and on how much this entropy is modified during the stream s penetration into the primary s core by shocks ( ivanova et al .",
    "the latter is a function of the density contrast between the stream and the surrounding matter and depends on how strongly the medium itself is stratified .",
    "a larger density gradient in the primary s material near the stream leads to more entropy generation in the stream .",
    "the stream will stop its fall when the ambient pressure becomes comparable to the stream pressure .    in the test cases ,",
    "the penetration depth is two times smaller in the model with large entropy generation ( with @xmath19 ) than in the model with @xmath18 .",
    "the distance to the he shell from @xmath20 is also larger . for a secondary that is",
    "more massive than @xmath31 , the stream is unable to penetrate into the he shell since the density contrast between the stream and the ambient medium is lower and the stream entropy higher .          in the layer where the hydrogen - rich stream penetrates into the helium - dominated layer ( see the middle and right panels of figure  2 ) , the stream entropy is higher than that of the surrounding material . as a consequence ,",
    "both the entropy and the hydrogen mass fraction @xmath32 have negative gradients .",
    "this leads to the formation of a local convective zone that rapidly expands outwards .",
    "as the stream continues to hit the core , it penetrates progressively deeper into the core for several reasons : first , the entropy of the donor material decreases as material from deeper inside the star is transferred .",
    "second , the outer layer of the he shell starts to expand , reducing the density in the outer part of the he shell .",
    "third , the mass transfer rate steadily goes up , and , fourth , the @xmath20 point moves closer to the helium core . in the case where the initial stream does not penetrate",
    "deeply enough into the he - rich layer and is unable to create a negative entropy gradient in the ambient medium , a convective zone still develops in the region where the stream is being dissolved , but more slowly ( the stream s entropy is still higher than the ambient medium and stream energy is being deposited , further increasing the entropy ) .",
    "this convective zone propagates inwards as the stream penetrates deeper .",
    "we found that in some models this zone can connect with the ocz ; however , it either never penetrates deeply enough to connect to the convective helium - burning shell , or it starts efficient steady hydrogen burning , leading to a drop of the temperature in the he convective shell .      based on these simulations , it seems that the main condition for experiencing explosive ce ejection ( ecee ) is that the stream is able to penetrate deeply enough into the he - rich zone from the very beginning such that both a negative entropy and a negative composition gradient are created .",
    "this favours models with convective overshooting and low - entropy generation .",
    "it also favours lower - mass secondaries with lower entropies .",
    "for example , for @xmath33 , after leaving @xmath20 , the stream can penetrate as much as 2.5@xmath34 of the core , while for @xmath35 it stops further from the primary center , passing through only 1@xmath34 .",
    "an alternative criterion is that @xmath23 is small : @xmath36 .",
    "based on our test calculations , we conclude that the conditions for a successful explosive common - envelope ejection are satisfied for secondary masses up to 3@xmath17 in the models with convective overshooting",
    ". a lower limit on the secondary mass is roughly given by 1@xmath17 where the energy released in the spiral - in does not provide enough energy to lead to an expansion of the envelope ( i.e. lead to a `` slow '' merger ) ; in that case the merger is expected to occur on a dynamical timescale .",
    "with these constraints to guide us , we find that the ecee conditions are found for primaries with masses up to 40@xmath17 .",
    "if the minimum mass for black - hole formation is 25@xmath17 , this leads to co cores in the range of 6.513@xmath17 ( using our standard convective overshooting parameter ) .    the amount of mass transferred from the secondary before the ce ejection also depends on the secondary s mass : it is about 1m@xmath1 for a 3@xmath17 secondary , 0.8@xmath17 for a 2@xmath17 secondary and 0.20.3@xmath17 for a 1@xmath17 secondary ( but this depends somewhat on the stream entropy parameter ) .      while the initial spiral - in and the early merger phase take place on a timescale of @xmath37yr , once the h - rich stream connects to the helium - core - burning shell",
    ", the evolution accelerates .",
    "the overall duration of the explosive phase is @xmath38yr , although 90% of the energy is released in the last few days . at the end of our calculations , the outer parts of the core",
    "expand with a velocity exceeding the local escape velocity , and typically 0.030.06@xmath17 of stream material has been burned explosively .",
    "the nuclear energy that has been released ( @xmath39 ergs ) exceeds the binding energy of both the he - rich layer and the common envelope by about a factor of 2 .    by the time the envelope is ejected , we find that the co core has been moderately spun - up by the accretion of angular momentum and transport into the core during the pre - explosive core - accretion phase .",
    "the characteristic specific angular momentum of the core is @xmath40@xmath41s@xmath3 , at the low end of what is required in the collapsar model for lgrbs .",
    "however , further spin - up is possible , since even after the ejection of the envelope , mass transfer is likely to continue and the system is close enough for tidal spin - up to operate.h ) , the core can be spun up significantly on a timescale of @xmath42yr ( also see brown et al .",
    "however , unlike the case considered by detmers et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the remaining lifetime of the primary after case c mass transfer is short enough that wind mass loss will not cause significant widening of the system which would then tidally spin down the star again . ]",
    "indeed , despite the ejection of the helium shell , the system does not widen appreciably , if at all , because there is still enough frictional angular - momentum loss to keep the secondary in roche - lobe contact .",
    "this suggests that the system will continue to transfer mass after the ce ejection .",
    "this mass transfer occurs on a thermal timescale since the secondary is highly out of thermal equilibrium , in fact has a radius smaller than its equilibrium radius , and will try to expand towards a new thermal - equilibrium stage .",
    "the remaining evolution of the primary s co core to core collapse is expected to be of order a few @xmath43 to at most @xmath44yr ( in the 18@xmath17 simulation it was 3000yr ) .",
    "we note that this time is significantly longer than it would have taken the core to core collapse without the ejection of the he layer because of the signifiant core expansion and cooling .",
    "in order to assess the importance of ecee events for lgrbs and low - mass black - hole binaries , we first estimate in this section the expected rate of these events and then present detailed binary population synthesis results that simulate the properties of the resulting black - hole ( bh ) binaries .     the cumulative rate for ecee events as a function of the minimum primary mass required .",
    "the black curves assume a maximum primary mass of 40@xmath45 whilst the grey curves take a maximum primary mass of 30@xmath45 .",
    "the solid curves assume a flat initial mass - ratio distribution ( @xmath46 ) , the dotted curves use @xmath47 .",
    "the light grey shading indicates a plausible range for the minimum mass of a single star which can form a black hole at solar metallicity . for these estimates we assumed that 1% of binaries have an orbital period that leads to case c mass transfer",
    ". the actual rate could be higher by an order of magnitude at low metallicity , and the minimum mass for bh formation could be lower .",
    ", width=317 ]      using the results discussed in the previous section , it is straightforward to estimate the fraction of binaries that experience explosive ce ejection .",
    "this depends mainly on the secondary mass and the condition that the systems experience case c mass transfer .",
    "figure [ fig : imftimesimrd ] shows the cumulative rate for ecee events as a function of the minimum primary mass for different assumptions about the maximum mass of the primary and different mass - ratio distributions . here",
    ", we assume that 1% of all binaries experience case c mass transfer at solar metallicity .",
    "the primary masses @xmath48 are chosen from an initial mass function @xmath49 ( kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 ) .",
    "the rates are nomalised to a core - collapse sn rate of 1 per century ( i.e. , assume that one star more massive than @xmath50 is formed per century in a typical galaxy ) .",
    "this probably underestimates the core - collapse supernova rate in the milky way ( cappellaro , evans & turatto 1999 ) .",
    "we also assumed that all massive stars form in binaries ( kobulnicky & fryer 2007 ) , with a distribution of initial separations @xmath51 that is flat in @xmath52 between 3 and @xmath53 .",
    "a significant source of uncertainty in the ecee rates is the initial mass - ratio distribution @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the mass ratio and @xmath56 is the mass of the secondary . in figure",
    "[ fig : imftimesimrd ] we consider a distribution where @xmath57 and one where @xmath58 .    in using the ecee mechanism to produce short - period black - hole x - ray binaries ,",
    "we require the primary to form a bh .",
    "the light grey shading in figure  [ fig : imftimesimrd ] indicates the expected minimum mass for black - hole formation , which is generally believed to be in the range of 2025@xmath17 ( see , e.g. , fryer & kalogera 2001 and further references in prh ) .",
    "black - hole formation is also generally assumed to be a requirement for the formation of lgrbs , though we note that rapid rotation at core - collapse for lower mass cores may lead to the formation of magnetars ( e.g. , thompson & duncan 1993 ; akiyama et al .",
    "magnetar formation has also been proposed as a channel for lgrbs ( e.g. , wheeler , hflich & wang 2000 ; burrows et al .  2007 ; uzdensky & macfadyen 2007 ; bucciantini et al .",
    "2008 ) , which would increase the potential lgrb event rate from this proposed mechanism . because of the steepness of the primary mass function , the upper limit of 40@xmath45 indicated by our hydrodynamic calculations is of lesser importance to the rates .",
    "the fraction of binary systems that experience case c mass transfer is strongly dependent on the metallicity and the assumptions about the wind - loss rate from the primary star ( see justham & podsiadlowski 2010 ) , but for z=0.02 , 1% is a reasonable estimate . on the other hand , if the nieuwenhuijzen & de jager ( 1990 ) wind - loss rates are correct , only primary stars with masses @xmath59 can experience case c mass transfer .",
    "this mass goes up to @xmath60 if the nieuwenhuijzen & de jager rate is reduced by a factor @xmath61 , to take into account that the the empirical rates are not corrected for the effects of wind clumping ( e.g. , moffat & carmelle 1994 ; fullerton , massa & prinja 2006 ) .",
    "however , as figue  3 shows , the uncertainty in this upper mass limit is not a significant contribution to the uncertainty in the ecee rate .",
    "hence , if we only allow primary masses of @xmath62 to produce lgrbs through the ecee channel , and take @xmath63 , we obtain a lgrb rate of @xmath2 gal@xmath3 yr@xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent , though at the lower end , of recent lgrb rate estimates ( e.g. , podsiadlowski et al .",
    "there is some evidence that lgrbs prefer lower metallicity ( e.g. , fruchter et al .",
    "2006 ; wolf & podsiadlowski 2007 ; modjaz et al .  2008 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the ecee scenario , since the rate of case c mass transfer increases with decreasing metallicity , by up to at least a factor of 10 at extremely low metallicity ( @xmath64 ; justham & podsiadlowski 2010 ) . given the uncertainties in these estimates , we conclude that the ecee channel could account for at least a significant subset of the lgrb rate and possibly all of it .",
    "ecee links lgrbs with short - period black - hole x - ray binaries .",

    "we also mark the maximum effective temperatures consistent with the spectral types of the known systems ( crosses with arrows).,width=317 ]      figure [ fig : teffperioddists ] shows a selection of our population synthesis calculations , which reproduces the shape of the observed orbital - period distribution fairly well , for @xmath86 and for no kick .",
    "however , the donor temperatures do not easily match the observations , unless either our model effective temperatures or our conversion from spectral type to effective temperatures is incorrect .",
    "note that these donor temperatures give a significantly better match to the observations than systems which initially contained intermediate - mass donors would provide ( see , e.g. , justham et al .",
    "2006 ) , and that this apparent mismatch in effective temperature seems to be a problem for all models , unless the donor stars in short - period bh binaries are pre - main sequence stars ( ivanova 2006 ) .",
    "hence this problem with effective temperatures appears to be a generic problem for models of these systems .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a new mechanism for the ejection of a common envelope where the energy source is not orbital energy but nuclear energy .",
    "this provides a new channel to produce plausible progenitors of short - period black - hole binaries and long - duration grbs .",
    "we have also demonstrated that this scenario may be able to explain both the origin and the main properties of short - period black - hole binaries , such as the period distribution , although the distribution of spectral types is still not fully satisfactory .",
    "two of the most attractive features of the explosive ce ejection scenario are that ( 1 ) it leads to the ejection of both the hydrogen and the helium layer , explaining why all lgrb supernovae to - date have been classified as type ic supernovae , and ( 2 ) this ejection occurs late in the evolution of the star ; hence the progenitor will only experience a short wolf - rayet phase , in which it will not be spun down significantly by wind mass loss .",
    "this may also explain why extended wolf - rayet wind bubbles are not being found around lgrbs ; e.g. , in the case of grb 021004 , van marle , langer & garcia - segura ( 2005 ) found that the wolf - rayet phase had to last less than @xmath87yr ; this is consistent with the explosive ce - ejection scenario , since it always requires late case c mass transfer .",
    "this also predicts that such wolf - rayet bubbles are terminated by a dense shell from the ejected common envelope .",
    "our rate estimate for this channel ( @xmath88yr@xmath3 ) implies that this can produce a significant fraction of all lgrbs ; this rate should be higher at lower metallicity , because case c mass transfer is expected to be more common at lower metallicity . unlike some of the single - star progenitor models for lgrbs ( yoon & langer 2005 ; woosley & heger 2006 ; yoon , langer & norman 2006 )",
    ", lgrbs may occur even at solar metallicity , but they are expected to be more common at low metallicity . indeed , there is some evidence now that lgrbs can also occur in super - solar host galaxies ( see , e.g. , levesque et al .",
    "the different metallicity biases may provide a possible way of distinguishing between these two different scenarios .",
    "explosive ce ejection also operates for lower - mass primaries that are expected to produce neutron stars rather than black holes .",
    "it is tempting to associate these with rapidly rotating neutron stars and possibly magnetars , for which sn 2006aj , which was associated with the x - ray flash grb 060218 , may provide an observed example in nature ( mazzali et al .",
