    "the phenomenological classification of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) based on their prompt emission observed @xmath15 durations defines `` long '' and `` short '' bursts which are , respectively , longer or shorter than @xmath16 s @xcite .",

    "the empirical rate can be evaluated as @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the number of identified energetic ns  ns short bursts , @xmath128 sr is the average fermi solid angle , and @xmath129 years is the fermi observational period .",
    "we infer a local rate of @xmath130gpc@xmath13yr@xmath14 , where the attached errors are determined from the @xmath131 confidence level of the poisson statistic @xcite . at @xmath132 ,",
    "the above inferred rate provides an expected number of events @xmath133 , which is consistent with the above three observed events during the fermi observational period .",
    "also at @xmath134 our estimate @xmath135 is consistent with the absence of any short grb detection .    with the inclusion of grb 081024b , with a theoretically estimated redshift @xmath136 ( more details will appear in aimuratov et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , the above rate remains stable with smaller error bars , i.e. , @xmath12gpc@xmath13yr@xmath14 .",
    "this inferred rate is different from that of the long grbs , recently estimated to be @xmath137 gpc@xmath13yr@xmath14 @xcite , and also from the estimates of the family-1 short grbs given in the literature ( without a beaming correction @xmath138@xmath88 gpc@xmath13yr@xmath14 , see e.g. , and @xcite ) .",
    "such a low rate can be explained based upon the existing data of binary nss within our galaxy ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : ns ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : dns ] we notice that only a subset of them has the sum of the masses of the components larger than the critical ns mass and can collapse to a bh in their merger process .",
    "only this subset can lead to a short grb .",
    "now we discuss some general considerations for the new @xmath9@xmath10 relation for short grbs @xcite , with a power law similar to the one of the amati relation for long grbs @xcite , but different amplitude .",
    "this yet unexplained difference discourages the use of the amati relation as an astronometrical tool .",
    "all four family-2 short grbs satisfy this new @xmath9@xmath10 relation ( see the quantities listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : lat ] ) .",
    "we call attention to the need to investigate the physical reasons for the validity of this universal @xmath9@xmath10 relation , which appears to be satisfied by short bursts , where the binary ns merger does not lead to bh formation , and also the short bursts , where bhs are formed and reveal their presence by giving rise to the short - lived but significant gev emission .",
    "in this article we have predicted the occurrence of two different kinds of short grbs originating from binary ns mergers , based on    * the analysis of grb 090227b , the prototype of short bursts originating from a binary ns leading to bh formation @xcite , * the recent progress in the determination of the mass - radius relation of nss and the determination of their critical mass @xmath139 m@xmath140 @xcite , and * the recently measured mass of psr j0348 + 0432 , @xmath39 m@xmath20 @xcite , establishing an absolute lower limit on @xmath18 , and the remarkable information gained from radio observations of binary ns systems in our own galaxy .",
    "the first kind of short grbs , which we call , are the most common ones with @xmath0 erg and rest - frame spectral peak energy @xmath17 mev , originating from binary ns mergers with merged core mass smaller than @xmath18 and leading , therefore , to a massive ns , possibly with a companion .",
    "we identify these short bursts with the ones extensively quoted in literature .",
    "the second kind of short grbs , which we call , are those with @xmath1 erg and harder spectra with @xmath141 mev , originating from binary ns mergers with merged core mass larger than @xmath18 .",
    "these short bursts satisfy the necessary condition to form a bh , following the example of the prototype grb 090227b @xcite .",
    "the application of the fireshell model @xcite to the short grb 140619b analyzed here has allowed the determination of the physical parameters of this source : the identification of the p - grb emission in the early @xmath2 s of its light curve , the theoretical cosmological redshift of @xmath5 and consequently the total burst energy @xmath142 ergs , the baryon load @xmath143 , and a lorentz @xmath54 factor at transparency @xmath144 .",
    "the analysis of the prompt emission has also led to the determination of the cbm density , @xmath145 cm@xmath13 , typical of the galactic halo environment , where ns ",
    "ns binaries migrate to , due to natal kicks imparted to them at birth , clearly supporting the binary ns merger hypothesis of this source .",
    "unexpectedly , we have found the existence of a short - lived and very intense gev emission , just after the p - grb occurrence and during and after the prompt emission phase , which has led us to conclude that this high energy emission originates from the newly - formed bh .    while this article was being refereed , we have discovered three additional examples of these short bursts : grb 081024b , grb 090510 , and grb 090227b .",
    "these have given evidence that all these short bursts indeed show the existence of high energy emission , with the sole exception of grb 090227b , which at the time of the observation was outside the nominal lat field of view .",
    "* all short grbs have an extended x - ray afterglow .",
    "when computed in the rest - frame @xmath87@xmath88 kev energy band they do not show any specific power - law behavior @xcite or the `` nesting '' properties @xcite which have been discovered in some long grbs .",
    "we predict that short grbs , originating from a binary merger to a massive ns , should never exhibit high energy emission .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath146 erg can be simply understood in terms of a merger leading to a massive ns . * all short grbs",
    "have been observed not to have prominent x - ray or optical afterglows .",
    "they all have short - lived but very energetic gev emissions ( see , e.g. , fig .  [ fig:8]b and c ) , when lat data are available .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath147 erg can be also simply understood in terms of a merger leading to bh formation . *",
    "the high energy emission episode in short grbs always occurs at the end of the p - grb emission , during and after the prompt emission phase .",
    "this fact uniquely links the high energy emission to the occurrence of the newly - born bh .",
    "the prompt emission phase studied within the fireshell model has also allowed the determination of a large number of essential astrophysical parameters , both of the source ( e.g. , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) and of the cbm ( e.g. , @xmath59 , @xmath55 , and @xmath148 ) .",
    "it is interesting that the very simplified conditions encountered in the short grbs in the absence of a sn event , which characterize the long grbs @xcite , have allowed definite progress in understanding some fundamental grb properties , e.g. , the correlation of high energy emission to the bh formation .",
    "they can be adapted to the case of long grbs .",
    "the points summarized above go a long way towards reaching a better understanding of and long grbs @xcite , as well as of the bdhne @xcite .",
    "we are confident that grb 140619b is one of the best examples of short grbs obtained with the current space technology .",
    "we sincerely hope that the results of our research will lead to new missions with greater collecting area and time resolution in x- and gamma - rays .",
