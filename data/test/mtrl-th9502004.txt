    "because of their simple crystal structure , the perovskite oxides present a special opportunity for the development of a detailed theoretical understanding of the ferroelectric phase transition . within this family of materials ,",
    "one finds transitions to a wide variety of low - symmetry phases , including ferroelectric and antiferroelectric transitions .",
    "both first- and second - order transitions are observed , with a full spectrum of transition behavior ranging from displacive to order - disorder .",
    "the properties of batio@xmath0 , a much - studied prototypical example of this class of compounds,@xcite exemplify this rich behavior .",
    "batio@xmath0 undergoes a succession of first - order phase transitions , from the high - temperature high - symmetry cubic perovskite phase ( fig .",
    "[ stru ] ) to slightly distorted ferroelectric structures with tetragonal , orthorhombic and rhombohedral symmetry .",
    "there is increasing evidence that the cubic - to - tetragonal transition , at first thought to be of the simple displacive kind , may instead be better described as of the order - disorder type .",
    "the variety exhibited by the perovskite oxides shows that the phase transformation behavior depends on details of the chemistry and structural energetics of each particular compound .",
    "therefore , it is of the first importance to develop a microscopic theory of the materials properties which determine the ordering of the phases , the character and thermodynamic order of the transitions , and the transition temperatures .",
    "the value of a microscopic approach has long been appreciated , but its realization was hindered by the difficulty of determining microscopic parameters for individual compounds .",
    "the forms of phenomenological model hamiltonians @xcite were limited by the available experimental data , leading to oversimplification and ambiguities in interpretation . for the perovskite oxides , empirical @xcite and non - empirical pair potential methods @xcite did not offer the high accuracy needed for the construction of realistic models .",
    "first - principles density functional calculations offer an attractive approach for enhancing our microscopic understanding of perovskites and other ferroelectrics . the all - electron full - potential linearized - augmented - plane - wave ( flapw )",
    "method has been used by several groups to study ferroelectricity in perovskites within the local density approximation ( lda).@xcite recently , king - smith and vanderbilt performed a systematic study of structural and dynamical properties and energy surfaces for eight common perovskites,@xcite using the first - principles ultra - soft pseudopotential method and the lda .",
    "these calculations demonstrate that ferroelectricity in the perovskites reflects a delicate balance between long - range electrostatic forces which favor the ferroelectric state , and short - range repulsions which favor the cubic phase . while constrained to calculations of zero - temperature properties , these calculations yield correct predictions of ground state structures and occurrence of ferroelectric phases for certain materials .",
    "they show that high - quality lda calculations can provide considerable insight into the nature of the total - energy surface in the perovskites .",
    "for further insight into the energetics of ferroelectric compounds , the polarization generated by various distortions can be studied directly , using a recent first - principles method by king - smith and vanderbilt.@xcite this approach has been applied to the investigation of the zone - center phonons in the common perovskite oxides.@xcite    the application of these first - principles methods can clearly form a foundation for the realistic study of the finite - temperature phase transitions . while an _ ab - initio _ molecular - dynamics simulation of the structural phase transition is not computationally feasible at present , we purse an alternative first - principles approach to study ferroelectric phase transitions and demonstrate its application to batio@xmath0 . in particular , we ( i ) construct an effective hamiltonian to describe the important degrees of freedom of the system,@xcite ( ii ) determine all the parameters of this effective hamiltonian from high - accuracy _ ab - initio _ lda calculations,@xcite and ( iii ) carry out monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to determine the phase transformation behavior of the resulting system .",
    "an abbreviated presentation of this work has already appeared in ref .  .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we go through the detailed procedure for the construction of the effective hamiltonian , and give the explicit formula . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe our first - principles calculations and the determination of the expansion parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "the technical details of the monte carlo simulation are presented in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v , we report our calculated transition temperatures , order parameters , and phase diagram , as well as thermodynamic order and nature of the phase transitions .",
    "the role of different interactions in determining the phase transition behavior is also discussed .",
    "vi concludes the paper .",
    "the central quantity for studying the equilibrium properties of a system at finite temperature is its partition function .",
    "this can be determined from the energy surface , i.e. , the total potential energy as a functional of the atomic coordinates . since the contribution to the partition function decreases exponentially with increasing energy , it is possible to obtain an accurate partition function for low - temperature applications from a simplified energy surface including only low - energy configurations .",
    "our goal is to construct a parameterized hamiltonian which ( i ) is _ ab initio",
    "_ , involving no empirical or semi - empirical input ; ( ii ) results in an accurate partition function for the temperature range of interest ; ( iii ) is fully specified by a few _ ab - initio _ total energy calculations ; and ( iv ) involves only approximations that are systematically improvable and removable .    our first fundamental approximation is to use an energy surface represented by a low - order taylor expansion .",
    "both experiments and first - principles total energy calculations suggest that the ferroelectric ( fe ) phase transition involves only very small atomic displacements and strain deformations from the equilibrium cubic structure .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that all the atomic configurations with significant contribution to the partition function would be close to this cubic structure in the temperature range of interest .",
    "thus , it is natural to represent the energy surface by a taylor series in the displacements from the cubic structure .",
    "we include up to fourth - order terms in our expansion ; this is clearly a minimum , since ferroelectricity is intrinsically an anharmonic phenomenon . by including higher - order terms , this approximation could later be systematically improved .",
    "it is convenient to describe the small distortions from the cubic structure in terms of the three acoustic and twelve optical normal - mode coordinates per k - point .",
    "while this could be regarded as only a change of basis , it motivates our second fundamental approximation , which is to restrict the expansion to include only low - energy distortions . to achieve this separation",
    ", we note that both experimentally - measured and lda - calculated phonon dispersion relations@xcite show that only the lowest to modes ( soft modes ) and long - wavelength acoustic phonons ( strain variables ) make significant contributions to the phonon density of states at low energy .",
    "experimental studies also suggest that the fe phase transitions are accompanied by a softening of the lowest to mode and the appearance of a strain .",
    "all other phonons are hardly affected by the transitions .",
    "it is then our second approximation to express the energy surface only as a function of the soft - mode amplitudes and strain .",
    "this approximation reduces the number of degrees of freedom per cell from fifteen to six , and greatly reduces the number of interaction parameters needed . if necessary",
    ", this approximation could later be relaxed by including additional modes .",
    "it is convenient to describe the soft mode over the whole brillouin zone ( bz ) in terms of a collective motion of `` local modes , '' just as one describes an acoustic phonon in terms of a collective displacement of individual atoms .",
    "however , there is more than one choice of local mode which will generate the same soft mode throughout the bz ; an intelligent choice can simplify the hamiltonian and reduce the number of calculations needed.@xcite first , the local mode should be as symmetric as possible , so as to minimize the number of expansion parameters needed .",
    "second , the interactions between local modes at different sites are more difficult to treat than their on - site energy , so the local mode should be chosen so as to minimize intersite interactions . for perovskite abo@xmath0 compounds ,",
    "the highest symmetry is achieved by centering the local mode on either atom a or b. in the case of batio@xmath0 , the ti ",
    "o bond is much stronger than the ba ",
    "o bond and the motion of the ti is more important in the fe transition , so we choose the local mode which is centered on the ti atom .    the soft zone - center ( @xmath1=0 ) fe mode in batio@xmath0 is a @xmath2 mode which can be characterized by the four parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ( for a mode polarized along the @xmath7th cartesian direction , these refer to the displacements of the a atom , the b atom , the o atom that forms a b  o bond along direction @xmath7 , and the other two o atoms , respectively ) .",
    "we take the corresponding local mode to consist of a motion of the central a atom by amount @xmath3 , the eight neighboring b atoms by amounts @xmath8 , and the six neighboring o atoms by amounts @xmath9 or @xmath10 , along the @xmath7th cartesian direction .",
    "this mode is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ stru ] ) ; its amplitude is denoted @xmath11 .",
    "an arbitrary @xmath12 soft mode can then be realized as a linear superposition of these local modes having identical amplitudes @xmath13 in every cell .",
    "the harmonic interactions between the local - mode amplitudes @xmath14 connecting neighboring cells @xmath15 must be chosen to reproduce the harmonic behavior of the soft - mode branch throughout the bz .",
    "long - range coulomb forces are known to play an important part in these interactions ; they are characterized in terms of the calculated born ( or `` transverse '' ) effective charges.@xcite thus , the harmonic intersite interactions are represented by a sum of two contributions : an infinite - range piece that is precisely the interaction of point dipoles whose magnitude is given by the born effective charge , and corrections which we take to be of covalent origin and therefore local .",
    "to be completely general , anharmonic intercell interactions between neighboring @xmath16 would likewise have to be included .",
    "instead , we include only _ on - site _ anharmonic interactions , which are chosen in such a way that the anharmonic couplings for @xmath12 modes of the real system are correctly reproduced .",
    "this `` local anharmonicity approximation '' is an important feature which helps make our scheme tractable and efficient . to go beyond this approximation",
    ", one could carry out a careful series of frozen - phonon lda calculations on supercells to determine anharmonic couplings at other points in the bz .",
    "however , past experience has shown that calculations of this kind are very cumbersome because of the large number of parameters which have to be determined.@xcite    with these approximations , our hamiltonian consists of five parts : a local - mode self energy , a long - range dipole - dipole interaction , a short - range interaction between soft modes , an elastic energy , and an interaction between the local modes and local strain .",
    "symbolically , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the local soft - mode amplitude vector , and @xmath19 is the six - component local strain tensor in voigt notation ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) . in the following subsections , we present the explicit formulae for these five contributions .",
    "the first term is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the energy of an isolated local mode at cell @xmath24 with amplitude @xmath16 , relative to that of the perfect cubic structure . to describe the fe phase",
    ", @xmath23 must contain anharmonic as well as harmonic contributions .",
    "since the reference structure is cubic , only even - order terms can enter ; we choose to truncate at fourth order .",
    "symmetry considerations then require that it take the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are expansion parameters to be determined from first - principles calculations .",
    "the second term in the effective hamiltonian represents long - range interactions between local modes .",
    "only dipole - dipole interactions are considered , since higher - order terms tend to be of short range and their effect will be included in the short - range contribution @xmath30 .",
    "the dipole moment associated with the local mode in cell @xmath15 is @xmath31 .",
    "here , @xmath32 is the born effective charge for the soft mode , which can be obtained as @xmath33 from the eigenvector of the soft mode , once the born effective charges for the ions are known.@xcite in atomic units ( energy in hartree ) , we have @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the optical dielectric constant of the material , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .    in practice ,",
    "( [ dipolesum ] ) is not directly useful for three - dimensional systems with periodic boundary conditions ; instead , we use an ewald construction to evaluate @xmath39 .",
    "we effectively terminate the sum in such a way that the @xmath12 modes of the supercell will represent physical to(@xmath40 ) modes . for a to mode , the induced depolarization electric field is zero ; from the point of view of the dipole sum , it is as though the material were surrounded by a layer of metal . in the ewald construction",

    "because of its long - range nature , the calculation of @xmath39 is the most time - consuming part of our monte carlo simulations .",
    "it is thus worth some special treatment to reduce the computational load . in principle",
    ", the term @xmath44 appearing in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ dipolesum ] ) should be strain - dependent .",
    "however , as we have chosen to expand the intersite interactions between local modes only up to harmonic order , it is consistent to ignore this effect , since strain - induced changes of the dipole - dipole interaction will enter only at higher order .",
    "this is equivalent to fixing the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath45 and all the atomic position vectors @xmath24 .",
    "the dipole energy can then be written as @xmath46 with @xmath47 \\ ; .\\ ] ] here , @xmath28 and @xmath48 denote cartesian components .",
    "the matrix @xmath49 is thus treated as a constant ; it is calculated once and for all , and stored for later calculation of the dipole energy .",
    "this strategy increases the computational efficiency by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "@xmath50 is the energy contribution due to the short - range interactions between neighboring local modes , with dipole - dipole interaction excluded .",
    "this contribution stems from differences of short - range repulsion and electronic hybridization between two adjacent local modes and two isolated local modes .",
    "together with the dipole - dipole interaction , this interaction determines the soft - mode energy away from the zone center .",
    "expanded up to the second order , it can be written as , @xmath51 the coupling matrix @xmath52 is a function of @xmath53 and should decay very fast with increasing @xmath54 . here , we consider the short - range interaction up to third nearest neighbor ( nn ) , whose local mode shares atoms with the local mode on the origin .",
    "local modes between further neighbors involve displacements of atoms at least two hops away ( in tight - binding language ) and their core - core repulsion or hybridization should be much less important than the dipole - dipole interaction which is taken care of in @xmath39 .    the interaction matrix @xmath52 can be greatly simplified by symmetry . for a cubic lattice",
    ", we have , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath28 component of @xmath57 .",
    "so we have only seven interaction parameters for a cubic lattice .",
    "the coefficients @xmath58 , @xmath59 , ... ,",
    "@xmath60 in the above equations have physical meanings that are sketched schematically in fig .",
    "for example , @xmath58 represents the interaction strength of `` @xmath61 '' like interactions between first neighbors .",
    "we will describe the state of elastic deformation of the batio@xmath0 crystal using local strain variables @xmath62 , where the voigt convention is used ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath24 labels a cell center ( ti ) site .",
    "in fact , the six variables per unit cell @xmath64 are not independent , but are obtained from three independent displacement variables per unit cell . in our analysis , these are taken as the dimensionless displacements @xmath65 ( in units of the lattice constant @xmath66 ) defined at the unit cell corner ( ba ) positions @xmath67 . in terms of these , the _ inhomogeneous _ strain variables @xmath68 are defined in the next subsection . because of our use of a periodic supercell in the monte carlo simulations , however , homogeneous strain deformations are not included in the configuration space @xmath69 .",

    "rather than use an expression like ( [ eqhom ] ) for the inhomogeneous strain energy , we have found it preferable to express this part directly in terms of the @xmath65.@xcite this approach keeps the acoustic phonon frequencies well behaved throughout the brillouin zone . to satisfy requirements of invariance under translations and rotations of the crystal as a whole",

    "this argument is justified by our monte carlo simulations which show that the calculated transition temperature is insensitive to different decompositions of @xmath119 and @xmath60 .",
    "this prompts us to make an approximate decomposition based on a simple physical argument : we expect the interaction to be smallest for two interacting local modes oriented such that reversing the relative sign of the vectors produces the least change of bond lengths .",
    "applied to third nearest neighbors , this argument implies @xmath120 , thus fixing the value of @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting interaction parameters are shown in table  [ table2 ] , together with other parameters published previously .",
    "it may be surprising to see that the on - site @xmath27 is positive , while the cubic structure is known to be unstable against @xmath12 distortion .",
    "the cubic structure is thus stable against forming an isolated local mode ; instability actually comes from the intersite interactions between local modes . to be more precise",

    "if we turn off the dipole - dipole interaction by setting the effective charge @xmath121 , we find that the ferroelectric instability disappears .",
    "this is consistent with the previous point of view that long - range coulomb forces favor the ferroelectric state , while short - range repulsions favor the nonpolar cubic state .    from table",
    "[ table2 ] , we see that the intersite interaction parameters decay very fast with increasing distance , indicating the short - range nature of the intersite interactions after the long - range coulomb interactions have been separated out .",

    "for the quantitative study of non - universal finite - temperature behavior of a given model , monte carlo simulation@xcite has emerged as the most reliable and powerful technique .",
    "it is especially appropriate for a model such as ours , with two continuous vector degrees of freedom per unit cell and both short and long range interactions , for which analytical approaches such as renormalization group or high - temperature expansions would be cumbersome and involve additional approximations . in comparison ,",
    "the monte carlo approach requires only the ability to compute changes in total energy as the configuration is changed .",
    "furthermore , with suitable analysis of statistical errors and finite - size effects , the results of monte carlo simulation can be made arbitrarily accurate .",

    "that is , a trial move consists of an attempted update of a single variable , after which the total energy change is calculated to determine whether to accept the move .",
    "the step sizes are adjusted to ensure an acceptance ratio of approximately 0.2 . in one monte carlo sweep ( mcs ) ,",
    "we first make a trial move on each @xmath16 in sequence , then each @xmath126 in sequence , then iterate several times ( typically @xmath127 times ) on the homogeneous strain variables . for @xmath128 ,",
    "each mcs takes about one second on an hp 735 workstation .",
    "the typical correlation time for the total energy is found to be several hundred mcs close to the phase transition ; this long correlation time makes certain new mc techniques using energy distribution functions@xcite unfavorable .",
    "the correlation times for the local mode amplitudes are one order of magnitude shorter , and thus 10,000 mcs are usually enough to equilibrate and to obtain averages of local mode variables with statistical error @xmath129% .",
    "in our simulation , we concentrate on identifying the succession of low - temperature phases , determining the phase transition temperatures , and extracting qualitative features of the transitions .",
    "this analysis will allow us to identify the features of the effective hamiltonian which most strongly affect the transition properties .",
    "for these purposes , it is most convenient to monitor directly the behavior of the homogeneous strain and the vector order parameter . in the case of the ferroelectric phase transition ,",

    "the effect of symmetry - equivalent rotations on the homogeneous strain is handled analogously , with the largest , the medium and the smallest linear strain components denoted by @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively , and shear strain components by @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the ferroelectric phase transition is very sensitive to hydrostatic pressure , or equivalently , to lattice constant .",

    "a system close to a displacive transition should show large and strongly temperature - dependent fluctuations of certain modes associated with a small portion of the brillouin zone ( bz ) ( for a ferroelectric transition , near @xmath40 ) .",
    "for an extreme order - disorder transition , on the other hand , the fluctuations are expected to be distributed over the whole bz . for batio@xmath0 , we calculated the average fourier modulus @xmath161 for eigenmodes at several high - symmetry k - points ( along @xmath40x , @xmath40m and @xmath40r ) for a range of temperatures above the c  t transition .",

    "for all the k - points considered , all the lo modes are almost temperature independent [ @xmath180 ] and are not included in the figure . along the @xmath40x direction ,",
    "the doubly - degenerate to modes are soft all the way to the zone boundary .",
    "in contrast , along the @xmath40r direction , both to modes become hard immediately after leaving the @xmath40 point . along the @xmath40m direction",
    ", the to1 mode becomes hard quickly , while the to2 branch remains soft at least halfway to the zone boundary .",
    "this behavior , especially along @xmath40x , does not conform completely to the displacive limit .",
    "this supports the interpretation of the c ",
    "t transition as intermediate between displacive and order - disorder , with a slightly stronger order - disorder character .",
    "thus , from the example of batio@xmath0 , it seems that a positive on - site quadratic coefficient does not automatically imply a displacive character for the transition .",
    "rather , the relevant criterion is the extent to which the unstable modes extend throughout the bz .",
    "our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the roles played by different types of interaction in the phase transition .",
    "first , we study the effect of strain . recall that the strain degrees of freedom were separated into local and homogeneous parts , representing finite- and infinite - wavelength acoustic modes , respectively .",
    "both parts were included in the simulations .",
    "if we eliminate the local strain ( while still allowing homogeneous strain ) , we find almost no change in the transition temperatures .",
    "this indicates that the effect of the short - wavelength acoustic modes may not be important for the ferroelectric phase transition .",
    "if the homogeneous strain is frozen at zero , however , we find a direct cubic ",
    "rhombohedral phase transition , instead of the correct series of three transitions .",
    "this demonstrates the important role of homogeneous strain .",
    "second , we studied the significance of the long - range coulomb interaction in the simulation . to do this , we changed the effective charge of the local mode ( and thus the dipole - dipole interaction strength ) , while modifying the second - order self - energy parameter @xmath27 , so that the frequencies of the zone - center and zone - boundary modes remain in agreement with the lda values .",
    "we found only a slight change ( 10% ) of the transition temperatures when the dipole - dipole interaction strength was doubled .",
    "however , elimination of the dipole - dipole interaction altogether changed the results dramatically ; the ground state becomes a complex antiferroelectric structure similar to the room - temperature structure of pbzro@xmath0 .",
    "this result shows that it is essential to include the long - range interaction , although small inaccuracies in the calculated values of the effective charges or dielectric constants may not be very critical .",
    "third , we investigated the sensitivity of our results to variations of the short - range interaction parameters .",
    "we find the accuracy of the first - neighbor interaction parameters ( @xmath58,@xmath59 ) is very important , and a mere 10% deviation can change the calculated transition temperatures dramatically , and can sometimes even change the ground state structure .",
    "second nearest - neighbor interactions are less important , and for the third - neighbor interactions , even a 100% change does not seem to have a strong effect on the values of t@xmath182 .",
    "this result is to be expected , and partly justifies our choice of including only up to third neighbors for the short range interactions .",
    "we have also tested the effect of our assumption @xmath183 .",
    "we find that any reasonable choice leads to a barely noticeable change in @xmath172 .    in short , highly accurate lda calculations",
    "do appear to be a prerequisite for an accurate determination of the transition temperatures , but as long as certain features of the energy surface are correctly described , other approximations can be made without significantly affecting the results .",
    "we have developed a first - principles approach to the study of structural phase transitions and finite - temperature properties in perovskite compounds .",
    "we construct an effective hamiltonian based on taylor expansion of the energy surface around the cubic structure , including soft optical modes and strain components as the possible distortions .",
    "the expansion parameters are determined by first - principles density - functional calculations using vanderbilt s ultra - soft pseudopotential .",
    "we have applied this scheme to batio@xmath0 and calculated the pressure - temperature phase diagram .",
    "we have obtained the sequence of low - temperature phases , the transition temperatures , and the spontaneous polarizations , and found them to be in good agreement with experiment .",
    "we find that long - wavelength acoustic modes and long - range dipolar interactions both play an important role in the phase transition , while short - wavelength acoustic modes are not as significant .",
    "accurate lda calculations are required for accurate determination of the transition temperatures .",
    "the c  t phase transition is not found to be well described as a simple displacive transition ; on the contrary , if anything it has more order - disorder character .    with slight modifications , our approach should be applicable to other perovskite compounds , as long as their structure is close to cubic and there are some low energy distortions responsible for the phase transitions .",
