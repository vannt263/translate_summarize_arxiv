    "in a head - on elastic collision of two identical objects , the momenta of the two participants are exchanged in any reference frame .",
    "@xcite in a fixed - target frame , the target acquires the energy and momentum of the incident object that makes a complete stop .",
    "such a complete energy - momentum transfer is hardly observed in many - body collisions .",
    "an interesting example is the newton s cradle which consists of a series of identical pendula that are aligned along a straight line on a horizontal level .",
    "however , this can actually be understood as a series of head - on collisions of two identical objects where small gaps between each pair of adjacent pendula are assumed .",
    "@xcite    although this small - gap model explains the observations , this model fails if some of adjacent pendula are in contact with each other so that the process can not be decomposed into a series of two - body collisions .",
    "the reason for this failure is that the conservation laws of energy and momentum are not enough to determine the final velocities .",
    "additional conditions such as force laws between objects are required to have a unique solution of the problem .",
    "various studies have been carried out to find an appropriate force laws governing the actual motions of the pendula .",
    "a phenomenological model is so called the contact hertz force of the form @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite further applications of the contact hertz force to various collision problems can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite in a recent work , we have studied the bouncing of a block against a rigid wall through one - dimensional multiple elastic collisions with a ball sandwiched by them . @xcite like the small - gap model , we assumed that each collision is instantaneous and the complete trajectories of the block and the ball were uniquely determined analytically . by taking the continuum limit of the exact analytic solution of the block trajectory , we have shown that the effective force carried by the ball is proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the distance between the block and the wall .",
    "this is consistent with previous results based on the differential equation that can be derived by taking the continuum limit of the energy - momentum conservation .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we generalize the model system of ref .",

    ", we find all possible values for _ the magic mass ratios _ @xmath13 at which the energy and momentum of the incident block are completely transferred to the scattered block .",

    "@xcite however , the pendula studied in these references are arranged in mass order so that the complete energy - momentum transfer from the incident pendulum to the target pendulum at the other end is achieved only if all of the pendula are of equal mass like the newton s cradle .",
    "redner considered a similar system consisting of two identical cannonballs approaching an initially stationary ping - pong ball .",
    "@xcite in that reference , the author mainly focused on deriving a simple relation between that elastic collision and a corresponding billiard system , which helps to obtain the total number of collisions of the system easily .",
