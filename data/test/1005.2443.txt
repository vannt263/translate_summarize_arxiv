    "fountain code @xcite and cooperative communication @xcite are two transmission strategies which are gaining popularity in recent years . in fountain codes ,",
    "message bits are grouped into blocks , each containing several packets .",
    "encoding is performed by taking random linear combination of the packets within each block over a galois field ( typically @xmath0 ) .",
    "as opposed to other fixed rate scheme , with fountain code , the source continuously transmits encoded packets until positive acknowledgement is received .",
    "hence , its optimality is guaranteed for erasure channels , regardless of the erasure probability .",
    "cooperation , on the other hand , improves transmission quality by making use of neighbouring nodes to forward the message to destination . by creating multiple paths between source and destination (",
    "each subjected to independent fading ) , a diversity advantage can be exploited .",
    "application of fountain codes in cooperative network have also been studied .",
    "for example , reference @xcite and @xcite proposed to combine distributed space time block coding ( dstbc ) and fountain code for single carrier and multiple carrier transmission respectively , and showed that extra diversity gain can be achieved . in @xcite , direct application of fountain code in cooperative network is analysed .",
    "it was shown that careful degree distribution design is necessary to ensure good decoding performance . alternatively , using conventional degree distribution , the encoding / decoding process at the relay node can be modified to cater for the online re - coding requirement , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "although it has been shown that performance improvement can be achieved using fountain codes in cooperative networks @xcite , this advantage brings about extra complexity , especially when more than one relay node is involved .",
    "motivated to address this issue , recently the authors have proposed an amplitude modulation scheme for fountain code transmission over multiple relay cooperative networks @xcite . however , the scheme is developed for erasure channels , and it is not directly applicable to wireless fading channels .",
    "the focus of this paper is to find an alternative strategy to tackle the above issue . here ,",
    "a novel scheme that combines network coding @xcite and fountain codes transmission is proposed . in erasure channel",
    ", the scheme applies digital network coding onto fountain encoded packets of two consecutive blocks , and allows source node to transmit together with the successful relay .",
    "whereas in wireless channel , the scheme employs analogue network coding with appropriate power allocation . the performance of the scheme is then analysed numerically , and it is shown to improve the overall throughput in both types of channel .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : systemmodel ] describes the system model .",
    "the proposed transmission scheme and its application into wireless channel are given in [ sec : transscheme ] and [ sec : appstowireless ] respectively .",
    "numerical results are then presented in section [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] gives concluding remarks .",
    "a half duplex cooperative network with one source @xmath1 , one destination @xmath2 , and two relay nodes ( denoted as @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) as depicted in figure [ fig : erasurenetwork ] is considered . at any one time , a node can either transmit or receive , but not both simultaneously .",
    "the channel between any given two nodes is modelled as erasure channel , with a superscript indicating the nodes under consideration ( e.g. , @xmath5 is used to indicate the erasure probability of the channel between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "message bits at the source are grouped into blocks of @xmath6 packets , each composed of @xmath7 information bits .",
    "fountain code is then applied to the @xmath6 packets in which linear combination of randomly selected @xmath8 ( generated following some degree distribution @xmath9 ) out of @xmath6 packets are transmitted . for simplicity ,",
    "random linear fountain code is considered throughout the analysis .",
    "therefore , the degree distribution used to generate encoded packets can be expressed as : @xmath10 which can be approximated as @xmath11 for large @xmath6 . here , @xmath12 denotes the number of combinations for selecting @xmath13 out of @xmath7 elements .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is independent of the actual degree distribution used , therefore the same technique can be applied to other ( more practical ) degree distributions such as robust soliton distribution @xcite .",
    "as a baseline comparison , direct transmission of fountain code from @xmath1 to @xmath2 is considered . in this case , the number of encoded packets received unerased at @xmath2 ( denoted as @xmath14 ) is random , and it is related to the number of transmitted packets ( @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ) through binomial distribution with parameter @xmath5 as follows : @xmath17 given that @xmath14 encoded packets are available at @xmath2 , the probability that the corresponding @xmath18 generator matrix is full rank can be calculated . following the assumption that random linear fountain code is used , all @xmath19 possible binary generator matrices are equiprobable . ] .",
    "hence , the probability of successful decoding can be calculated as : @xmath20 the above equation can be interpreted as the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of successful decoding after @xmath14 packets are received .",
    "the respective probability distribution function ( pdf ) can be expressed as : @xmath21 noting that the transmission stops as soon as @xmath2 is able to decode , the pdf of successful decoding after @xmath15 transmissions is given as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the normalising constant to satisfy the unit - sum constraint @xmath24 , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are given in ( [ eqn : binom ] ) and ( [ eqn : pm ] ) respectively .      in the presence of relay node , a natural way to perform transmission",
    "is through multiple hops using two - phase scheme as illustrated in figure [ fig : conventionalrelay ] . during the first phase , @xmath1 broadcasts fountain encoded packets to all @xmath27 s , as well as @xmath2 . since @xmath28 (",
    "assumed to be equal for all relays ) is smaller than @xmath5 due to geographical proximity , it is highly likely that one of the @xmath27 s is able to decode the message before @xmath2 .",
    "denoting the total number of relays as @xmath29 , the probability that any of them is able to decode after @xmath30 transmissions can be calculated as : @xmath31^r [ \\sum_{i > j } p^{(1)}(i , p_e^{sr } ) ] ^{\\mathcal{r}-r}\\ ] ] the above equation holds for any value of @xmath29 , and it determines the duration of phase one transmission .",
    "once any of the @xmath27 s decodes , the transmission enters the second phase , whereby the successful @xmath27 transmits fountain encoded packets to @xmath2 . since the last packet from @xmath27 to @xmath2 must not be erased , the pdf of successful decoding after @xmath15 transmissions is given as : @xmath32^\\mathcal{r } + ( 1-p_e^{rd } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{-20pt } \\sum_{j < m } \\ !",
    "\\left(\\sum_{s=0}^j   \\!\\ !",
    "\\sum_{t=0}^{m - j-1 } \\!\\!\\ !",
    "\\mathcal{b}_{j , p_e^{sd}}(s ) \\mathcal{b}_{m - j-1 , p_e^{rd}}(t ) f(s\\!+\\!t\\!+\\!1 ) \\!\\",
    "! \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term represents the case when @xmath2 is able to decode before any of the @xmath27 s , hence the probability of successful decoding falls back to direct transmission case ; and the second term represents the case when one of the @xmath27 s is able to decode before @xmath2 , hence the received packets come from both @xmath1 and @xmath27 during the first and second phase respectively .    * _ remark : _ * due to broadcast nature of the transmission , the other relays can receive the packets from the transmitting relay during phase two .",
    "however , those packets would not be useful , as they only contain information about the current message block .",
    "the moment @xmath2 is able to decode , it will send positive acknowledgement ( ack ) , and a new protocol cycle starts . here",
    ", ideal ack channel is assumed available for simplicity .",
    "the idea of this scheme is to allow @xmath1 transmitting partial information about the next message block during the second phase , hence enabling the receiving relays to help the transmission of subsequent message blocks .",
    "the first phase transmission in this case is identical to the naive relaying scheme . on the second phase , in addition to the successful @xmath27",
    ", @xmath1 also transmits the network coded version of fountain codes for the current and the next message block as illustrated in figure [ fig : proposedscheme ] . here , the fountain code for the current message block at the successful @xmath27 and @xmath1 are identical , while different code can be used for the next message block at @xmath1 .    without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath3 be the successful relay , and there are only two relays in the network .",
    "since the channel is an ideal erasure channel , the effective packet received at @xmath4 and @xmath2 is the combination ( bit - wise exclusive - or ) of the packets transmitted from @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "depending on which of those packets are erased , @xmath2 would store the resulting packet to one of the three buffers it maintains as illustrated in table [ tab : buffer ] .",
    "when the packet from @xmath27 is the only one unerased , the received packet contains information about the current block , and it is stored in buffer @xmath33 . when the packet from @xmath1 is the only one unerased , the packet contains a network coded version of the current and next block , and it is stored in buffer @xmath34 . finally , when both packets are unerased , the received packet contains information about the next block , and it is stored in buffer @xmath35 .",
    ".buffer assignment table at destination node during phase two .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]          in this approach , we focus more on the amount of information to be sent across to destination , which is equal to @xmath36 bits in each block . denoting the capacity between @xmath1 and @xmath2 as @xmath37 , the duration of phase one transmission can be calculated as @xmath38 .",
    "the constant @xmath39 is the snr - gap used to cater for the imperfection of the actual modulation used as compared to gaussian codewords @xcite-@xcite . during this @xmath40 period",
    ", @xmath2 also received @xmath41 bits of information .",
    "therefore , the remaining information about the current block that @xmath2 requires during phase two is @xmath42 bits .",
    "following the proposed scheme , both @xmath1 and @xmath3 transmit to @xmath2 in phase two . here",
    ", there are several possibilities . in one extreme",
    ", @xmath1 can transmit information about the same message block ( denoted as @xmath43 ) .",
    "the received signal at @xmath2 is then : @xmath44 after coherent detection is performed with respect to the combined channel , the resulting capacity can be expressed as : @xmath45 with this approach , the duration of phase two transmission is minimised . however , no information about the next message block is sent , hence similar problem arises . in the other extreme",
    ", @xmath1 can transmit information about the next message block .",
    "the received signal model at the destination is then : @xmath46 it is observed that the above model is a multiple access channel model .",
    "the capacity region of this channel is shown by the red line in figure [ fig : capacityregion ] . as compared to the previous case ( @xmath1 transmits only block @xmath47 information ,",
    "whose capacity region is reflected as the blue curve in figure [ fig : capacityregion ] ) , the rate of transmission about the current block is smaller .",
    "therefore the duration of phase two is also longer . on the other hand ,",
    "some information about the next message block will also get transmitted to both @xmath27 and @xmath2 , which will expedite the transmission of subsequent message blocks .",
    "however , the advantage of having some information about the next message block versus the penalty due to longer phase two duration needs to be studied .",
    "having considered the two extreme cases , it is natural to analyse the condition between those two extremes . in this case , @xmath1 transmits a combination of the message from current block @xmath47 and the next block @xmath48 , resulting in the following : @xmath49 this scheme is also known as analogue network coding or superposition coding @xcite .",
    "to satisfy the transmit power limitation , additional constraint @xmath50 is imposed .",
    "it is apparent that the above channel is another multiple access channel , with channel gains @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which are used to transmit information about current and the next block respectively .",
    "the capacity region of this scheme is shown by the black curve in figure [ fig : capacityregion ] .",
    "several observations can be made about the new capacity region .",
    "firstly , as the value of @xmath53 is increased , the rate for transmitting the next message block @xmath48 decreases .",
    "secondly , as @xmath53 increases , the rate of transmitting the current message block @xmath47 is increased , reducing the time required in phase two transmission .",
    "lastly , another interesting observation is that the sum rate capacity ( indicated by the doted green line in figure [ fig : capacityregion ] ) increases with parameter @xmath53 , which suggests that larger @xmath53 is better .",
    "however , @xmath53 should not be too large , as otherwise no information about the next block can be delivered .    taking the union of all capacity regions as parameter @xmath53",
    "is varied , the entire capacity region of network coded transmission scheme can be found ( depicted as the pink curve in the figure [ fig : capacityregion ] ) ) .",
    "optimal operating point lies in the boundary line of this region .",
    "however , further investigation is required to find the best trade - off point .",
    "one good operating point is to set the transmission rate for the current message block to be equal to the rate when only @xmath27 transmits during phase two . in this way ,",
    "the duration of phase two transmission is left unchanged . meanwhile , by operating at the boundary line of the capacity region , the amount of information about the next message block at the destination ( and receiving relay ) is maximised .",
    "in this section , the performance of various schemes in terms of required number of transmissions are analysed . due to the nature of fountain code , no analysis on bit error rate is given , as transmission is allowed to continue until successful decoding is achieved at destination . a system with single destination and two relay nodes",
    "is considered .",
    "the erasure probability of the direct link is set to @xmath54 , while that of the indirect links is set to @xmath55 .",
    "the number of packets in each message block is @xmath56 , and transmissions are normalised with respect to packet size @xmath7 .",
    "figure [ fig : histogram ] shows the histogram as well as the corresponding pdf ( calculated using equation ( [ eqn : p3 ] ) ) of the required number of transmissions using the proposed network coded scheme . the pdf of the number of transmissions under direct transmission and naive relaying schemes ( calculated according to equation ( [ eqn : p1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : p2 ] ) respectively ) are also shown for comparison .",
    "it is observed from the figure that the proposed scheme outperforms both direct transmission and naive relaying , which is reflected by the smaller mean in the required transmissions .",
    "it is to be noted , however , that the variance is larger ; which signifies that it is more suitable for non delay - constrained applications .",
    "another interesting observation is that unlike the other two schemes , there is a positive probability that successful decoding is possible in less than @xmath6 transmissions .",
    "this is attributed from the extra information in the form of encoded packets , which are received during the previous block .    in figure",
    "[ fig : meantransmissions ] , the average required number of transmissions over wireless channel is depicted for the three schemes under consideration . here , the path loss parameter is related to distance according to @xmath57 , where path loss exponent @xmath53 is set to 3 , and the source - destination distance ( @xmath58 ) is set to @xmath59 meters .",
    "meanwhile , the distance of the relay with respect to both source and destination is set to @xmath60 meters , and the inter - relay distance is @xmath61 meters . from figure [",
    "fig : meantransmissions ] , it is observed that the schemes exhibit similar behaviour in wireless channel ( for both approaches ) , whereby the proposed network coded scheme outperforms the other two schemes .",
    "the difference is more prominent in low snr regime . in high snr regime ,",
    "the effective erasure probability is very small , hence the performance of the three schemes are comparable .",
    "in this paper , a novel transmission scheme of fountain code over cooperative relay networks with multiple relay nodes is proposed .",
    "the scheme combines network coding concept to allow source node transmitting partial information about the next message block during the current block transmission .",
    "this extra information will expedite the transmission of subsequent blocks , thereby improving the overall throughput .",
    "two possible approaches to implement the scheme into wireless channel are discussed .",
    "it is then shown via numerical analysis that in both approaches , the proposed scheme is able to outperform the naive relaying scheme , especially in low snr regime .",
    "future work includes a search for optimal operating point as well as a development of robust scheme , which could adapt the relaying strategy according to channel conditions .",
