    "the limb - brightened morphology shown in several radio galaxies can be regarded as the evidence of a slower sheath - jet surrounding a faster spine - jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the afterglow data of grb 030329 also demanded a two - component jet ( @xcite ) : a narrow ultra - relativistic component responsible for the @xmath6-ray and early afterglow , and a wide , mildly relativistic component responsible for the radio and optical afterglow after 1.5 days .",
    "the rebrightening of xrf 030723 and the chromatic behavior of the broadband afterglow of grb 080319b have been considered as further evidence for a two - component jet in grbs ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested a two - component jet model with a baryon - poor jet existing within a baryon - rich outflow .",
    "the baryon - poor jet may be driven by the blandford - znajek ( b - z ) mechanism ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in which the rotational energy of a black hole ( hereafter bh ) is extracted to power the jet in the form of a poynting flux via the open field lines penetrating the event horizon .",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility of using the coexistence of b - z and blandford - payne ( b - p ) ( @xcite ) processes as an interpretation of the two - component jets for quasars and microquasars . in the b - p process",

    "it is argued that the baryon - rich jet can also play an important role in the collimation of the central jet ( @xcite ) . in the grb context , @xcite proposed a two - component jet scenario invoking a wide neutron jet and a narrow proton jet , and calculated the afterglow behavior in detail .",
    "@xcite proposed a two - component jet model for both grbs and agns , in which the inner and outer jets are powered by the b - z and b - p processes , respectively .",

    "recently , much attention has been paid on the discovery of the hard x - ray transient event swift j16449.3 + 573451 , ( `` sw j1644 + 57 '' hereafter , @xcite ) .",
    "this event has been interpreted as a tidal disruption event ( tde ) with jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "its rich observations in @xmath6-ray , x - ray , radio , mm , infrared bands provide us a good opportunity to study the underlying physics of launching a relativistic jet / outflow from tde events .",
    "detailed data also allow us to diagnose the composition and the structure of the jet .",
    "the unusual features of sw j1644 + 57 in its super - eddington x - ray luminosity ( @xcite ) , bright radio afterglow ( @xcite ) , and a historical stringent x - ray flux upper limit suggest that this tde is closely related to the onset of a relativistic jet from a supermassive bh .",
    "the jet is expected to be magnetically dominated ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that b - z process is the plausible mechanism to launch the relativistic jet from this source ( @xcite ) , and they used the available data to constrain the bh spin for sw j1644 + 57 .",
    "it is found that the bh of this source carries a moderate to high spin , suggesting that bh spin is likely the crucial factor of powering the jet / outflow from this bh system .",
    "in addition , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lzg13 ) interpreted a 2.7-day quasi - periodic variation with noticeable narrow dips in the x - ray light curve by invoking a precessing , b - z powered jet collimated by a wind launched from a twisted and warped disk . such a picture is reasonable , since very likely the initial orbital plan of the disrupted star is likely mis - aligned with the equatorial plane of the bh .",
    "recently , @xcite detected a @xmath0 200s quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) from the 2-to-10-kev power spectra of both the suzaku and xmm - newton observations of this source at redshift @xmath7 .",
    "it is interesting to note that both quasi - periodic variations ( 2.7-days and 200s ) were detected a few days after the bat trigger despite of using different instruments ( @xcite ) .",
    "a number of models have been proposed to interpret the 200s qpo .",
    "* hereafter al12 ) regarded this observed qpo as one of `` 3:2 twin peak qpo '' , assuming that the second frequency was not observed based on the resonance in two eigen - modes of disk oscillations ( @xcite ) .",

    "very recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tmgk14 ) assumed the presence of a strong magnetic flux threading the bh , and suggested a five - stage jet activity to interpret the evolution and radiation characteristics of this tde .",
    "the 200s qpo is explained based on the jet - disk qpo mechanism proposed by @xcite , and the bh mass and spin are constrained in tmgk14 by considering three scenarios : ( i ) a complete or ( ii ) partial tidal disruption of a lower mass main - sequence star by a supermassive bh ; or ( iii ) a complete disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate - mass bh .",
    "however , they did not interpret the 2.7-day variation . here",
    "we propose a structured jet model to interpret the two quasi - periodic variations of swift j1644 + 57 based on @xcite and lzg13 .",
    "we suggest that the jet consists of an inner and an outer component .",
    "the 200s qpo is related to the inner jet launched from the horizon of a spinning bh surrounded by a warped accretion disk , and the 2.7-days quasi - periodic variation is associated with the outer processing jet launched near the bardeen - petterson radius .    besides the two quasi - periodic variations discovered in the x - ray emission , the radio observation extending to about 600 days also revealed unexpected features : about 1 month later , the radio emission showed a surprising re - brightening feature . the late time x - ray flux",
    ", however , did not show this re - brightening but instead showed a dramatic transition starting from @xmath8 days with a sharp decline .",
    "therefore the x - ray and radio emissions likely have distinct physical origins : the x - rays may originate from internal dissipation within the jet ( @xcite ) , while the radio emission may originate from the forward shock that propagates into the surrounding material ( @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the radio re - brightening is a result of late - time energy injection from the central engine . based on such a single jet model , @xcite argued that the outflow gradually transits from a conical jet to a cylindrical one at later times .",
    "however , to explain the late - time radio re - brightening , these models require that the energy of the source increases by a factor of 10 - 20 from 5 to 200 days , and there is no indication for this additional energy injection from x - ray observations .",
    "more recently , @xcite argued that the effect of inverse - compton cooling of electrons in the external shock region by the internal emission ( x - rays ) could give rise to a flat radio light curve . realizing that the early - time x - ray and radio emission must have a separate origin , @xcite proposed a two - component jet model . in their model ,",
    "the inner jet with a high lorentz factor accounts for the early x - ray emission and the late radio re - brightening , while the outer , slower jet is responsible for the early radio emission .",
    "this model can explain radio emission up to 216 days .",
    "our two - component jet model is different : besides interpret the two quasi - period variation features in x - rays , we invoke the inner ( faster ) jet to interpret the early radio emission , and the outer ( slower ) jet to interpret the late radio observations .",
    "our model can account for the radio light curve all the way to @xmath0 600 days .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we present our model to interpret the two quasi - periodic variations in the x - ray flux . in sect .",
    "3 , we apply the model to the interpret the radio data . we summarize the results in sect .",
    "4 with some discussion .",
    "it is noted that two quasi - periodic variations of swift j1644 + 57 were detected after a few days since the bat trigger ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first is a rough 2.7-day periodicity in the dips of the xrt light curve of sw j1644 + 57 .",
    "this quasi - periodic signal was first pointed out by @xcite , more carefully studied by @xcite , and then further confirmed by lzg13 using the stepwise filter correlation ( sfc ) method .",
    "the details of the sfc method and its application to grb light curves are presented in @xcite . the second qpo feature was discovered by @xcite , who produced the light curves of sw j1644 + 57 over the 0.2-to-10.0-kev energy band using all the observational data from different detectors .",
    "they fourier transformed these light curves to obtain their power density spectra .",
    "the 2-to-10-kev power density spectra of both the suzaku and first xmm - newton observations displayed a potential qpo component near 5 mhz .",
    "the fractional root - mean - square variability in the qpo is @xmath9 and @xmath10 for suzaku and xmm - newton , respectively .",
    "these two apparent quasi - periodic features are the motivation of our two - component jet model .    by studying the x - ray timing and spectral variability of sw j1644 + 57",
    ", @xcite found that the x - ray spectrum became much softer during each of the early dip , while the spectrum outside the dips became mildly harder in its long - term evolution . combining @xcite with lzg13",
    ", we think that these soft dips can be also interpreted by a spine - sheath two - component jet structure : a natural mechanism to account for these dips would be a precessing jet driven by the b - p process at the bardeen - petterson radius @xmath11 , which is much softer than the inner jet launched at the bh horizon .",
    "the reason could be that the lorentz factor of the outer jet is much less than that of the inner jet , leading to much softer photons during the early phase of each dip .     and",
    "@xmath12 for the inner and outer jets , respectively ) : the outer jet is directed along the disk normal direction around @xmath11 , while the inner jet is directed along the direction of the magnetic axis of the bh , both are misaligned with the direction of the bh spin @xmath13 .",
    "the two jets are collimated with opening angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the observer makes an angle @xmath16 with respect to the bh spin axis.,width=302 ]    a two - component jet consists of an inner and an outer jet cone is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the jet configuration is constructed base on following considerations :    \\(i ) the initial stellar orbit is likely misaligned with the equatorial plane of the spinning bh .",
    "\\(ii ) the outer jet directed to the disk normal direction around @xmath11 as argued in lzg13 .",
    "it is misaligned with the bh spin axis due to the bardeen - petterson effect ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the inner jet is directed by the direction of the magnetic axis of bh .",
    "the bh alone can not maintain such magnetic field lines .",
    "they should be dragged by the accreting materials in the warped disk and are accumulated to the bh horizon .",
    "therefore , the magnetic axis and then the inner jet is also misaligned ( with a smaller degree with respect to the outer jet ) with the direction of the bh spin @xmath13 .",
    "the inner jet is dragged by the spinning bh with an angular velocity @xmath17 of the magnetic field lines , which is less than the angular velocity of the spinning bh @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 .",
    "generally , the coefficient @xmath21 is uncertain , being taken as 0.5 for the optimal b - z power ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the period of the inner jet revolving around the bh spin can be estimated as @xmath22 the angular velocity of the bh is given by @xmath23 where the bh spin @xmath24 is related to the bh angular momentum by @xmath25 .",
    "on the other hand , the precession period @xmath26 of the outer jet can be estimated as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the precession angular velocity due to the lense - thirring effect ( hereafter lt , @xcite ) , and it reads @xmath29    taking the redshift factor @xmath30 into account , we have the observational values of these two periods as follows @xmath31 @xmath32    it is easy to check that the ratio @xmath33 can be written as @xmath34 where three parameters , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are involved , and @xmath37 is the radius @xmath11 in terms of the gravitational radius @xmath38 .    combining equations ( [ eq1])([eq7 ] ) with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we have the following set of the parameters required by the two quasi - periodic variations ( 200s and 2.7-day ) of sw j1644 + 57 : @xmath41    fixing @xmath39 and @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 for @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "we therefore estimate ( for @xmath47 ) @xmath48    as argued in lzg13 , the radius @xmath11 is closely related to the initial inclination of the stellar orbit @xmath49 , and @xmath42 can be attained for appropriate values of @xmath49 and the outer disk boundary radius @xmath50 .",
    "taking @xmath51 ( corresponding to the optimal b - z power ) , the estimated bh mass is less than @xmath52 as shown in equation ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "this estimation is roughly in accord with that given in tmgk14 for the scenario of the partial tidal disruption of a low - mass main - sequence star , but it is one order of magnitude smaller than that estimated in @xcite .",
    "however , the lower bh mass does not lead to a lower jet luminosity , since @xmath53 is essentially independent of the bh mass as argued in @xcite .    in order to interpret the noticeable narrow dips in the 2.7-day quasi - periodic variation , we plot the projected regions of the two jet components on the celestial sphere , as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the projected regions of the outer / inner jet cones are indicated by the larger / smaller shaded circles centered at @xmath54/@xmath55 , respectively , and the bh spin axis @xmath56 and line of sight ( los ) are fixed points on the celestial sphere .",
    "it is found that the outer jet cone revolves with an angular velocity @xmath57 around @xmath56 along the dashed circle given in fig.[fig2 ] , and the observer moves with a period @xmath58 , and enters and exits the outer jet cone periodically .",
    "the observer is located at inside the outer jet cone during the outer jet cone moves from panel ( a ) to panel ( c ) , and is located at outside the outer jet cone during the outer jet cone leaves panel ( c ) , passing by panel ( d ) , and returns to panel ( a ) .",
    "the narrow dips indicate that the los can not be too far away from the bh spin axis @xmath56",
    ". one can expect @xmath59 ( lzg13 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the observer may remain outside the inner jet cone ( as shown in fig.[fig2 ] ) , giving rise to much smaller variation in luminosity with a much smaller period @xmath60 due to the revolution of inner jet around the bh spin .",
    "we thus take @xmath61 .",

    "the outer jet cone ( light gray shaded disc ) revolves with an angular velocity @xmath57 around @xmath56 along the larger dashed circle .",

    "the center of the outer and inner jets are denoted by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively.,width=302 ]    a comparison between this and other models is summarized in table [ tb1 ] .",
    "the advantage of this model lies in the fact that both quasi - periodic variations ( 200s qpo and 2.7-day variation ) of sw j1644 + 57 can be accounted for with a two - component jet model with a warped accretion disk , in which two promising jet launching mechanisms , the b - z and b - p processes , are invoked .",

    "the millimeter flux on a timescale of @xmath1 days is significantly brighter than what is expected by extrapolating the early declining light curve based on a single jet model ( @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite suggested that this implies continuous injection of energy to the decelerating blast wave , which produced this re - brightening radiation for @xmath1 days .",
    "this model requires about 20 times more energy in the blast wave than the initial jet energy that produced the strong x - ray signal , which is of the order of @xmath73 .",
    "it is puzzling why such a large kinetic energy did not leave imprints in x - rays .    as shown in @xcite , this",
    "re - brightening can be naturally accounted for by a two - component jet model . however , their model is quite different from ours .",
    "they suggested that the inner jet is responsible for both the early x - ray emission and late radio re - brightening , while the outer jet is the source of the early times radio emission . in our model , as described above , both the inner and outer jets contribute to the x - ray emission , which leave imprints on the x - ray light curve in the form of quasi - periodic variations .",

    "it is unlikely for it to account for the late re - brightening in radio emission .",

    "we will show that our model can interpret the long - term radio data up to @xmath74 days .    inspecting the observed x - ray light curve of sw j1644 + 57",
    ", the jet power may evolve with time as @xmath75 at later times .",
    "in such case , the late time dynamics of jet just depends on the total ejected kinetic isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath76 , which is about the energy injected in the initial emission episode ( @xcite ) .    .",

    "the two jets are assumed to be both along the bh spin axis . comparing with fig.[fig1 ]",
    ", we now neglect the jet precession effect .",
    "such a simple configuration is reasonable due to the follow reasons .",
    "first , the effect of jet precession does not noticeably change the jet dynamics , since we observe most of the outer - wide jet beam and are always outside the inner - narrow jet .",
    "second , as discussed in @xcite , the precessing jet would evolve and finally be aligned with the bh spin axis .",
    "finally , the observations also show the evolution of the precessing period ( @xcite ) , which is consistent with that expected by @xcite .",
    "we consider the two - component jet propagrates into a gaseous circumnuclear medium ( cnm ) with a number density @xmath77 . for a collimated jet ,",
    "the jet effect becomes important when @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "studies of sw j1644 + 57 indicated that the jet bulk lorentz factor is @xmath79 and the jet opening angle is @xmath80 ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that the initial lorentz factor obeys @xmath81 . in the calculations ,",
    "we include a suppression of the flux density by a factor of @xmath82 due to this jet break effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "the steep spectral slope at lower frequencies indicate the existence of self - absorption ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore calculate the self - absorption frequency in detail .",
    "@xcite argued that the inverse - compton cooling of electrons by x - ray photons streaming through the external shock region is an important cooling mechanism .",
    "we therefore also consider this effect in our model .",
    "to do this , one needs to solve the following equation for the cooling lorentz factor @xmath83 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 @xmath86 is comoving frame magnetic energy density , @xmath87 is the co - moving synchrotron photon energy density , and @xmath88 is x - ray photon energy density below the klein - nishina frequency , @xmath89 in the co - moving frame , and @xmath90 in the observer frame .",

    "following @xcite , the x - ray luminosity in 0.3 -10 kev is taken as @xmath92 for @xmath93d , and as a constant between 10 and 20 d.    we also assume @xmath94 .",
    "due to poor baryon loading ( @xcite ) , the inner jet should contain a large lorentz factor .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that the early radio emission comes from the forward shock of the inner jet .",
    "the outer jet has more baryon loading and is more energetic , so that it decelerates at a later epoch , which would be responsible for the late rebrightening around @xmath1 days .",

    "since it occurs at earlier times , we have the flux from the inner jet as , @xmath144 for @xmath145 . at @xmath146 days",
    ", the emission from the outer jet becomes the dominant component .",
    "the light curve rises first ( during the coasting phase ) , and then decays after the jet enters the deceleration phase at about 200 days .",
    "the late - time flux of the outer jet is given by ( in the regime of @xmath143 ) : @xmath147    the blastwave eventually enters the newtonian phase when it has swept up a cnm mass whose rest energy is comparable to the energy of the ejecta .",
    "the sedov time is , @xmath148^{1/3 } \\simeq 368 \\ { \\rm day } \\",
    "e_{53}^{1/3 } , \\ ] ] for the inner ( outer ) jet , the sedov time is about 200 days ( 400 days ) , which is much longer than that estimated by eq.([bm ] ) ( e.g. , taken to be the time when @xmath149 , i.e. , @xmath150 ) .",
    "this is reasonable , because the bm solution is not fully applicable for such a mildly relativistic case .    in the non - relativistic ( newtonian ) regime ,",
    "the dynamics is described by the well know sedov - taylor solution .",
    "we have the synchrotron frequencies as ( @xcite ) @xmath151 in this phase , the synchrotron emission is dominated by the outer jet .",
    "the synchrotron emission flux from the outer jet can be written as @xmath152    this two - component external shock model also predicts x - ray emission . as a self - consistency check , we also compare the predicted x - ray flux with the long - term x - ray observational data .",
    "late time x - ray observations with swift / xrt and chandra revealed a dramatic change in the lightcurve evolution : following a steady @xmath153 decline at @xmath154 days , there was a sharp decline by about a factor of 170 at @xmath155 days",
    ".     days .",
    "the solid line shows the x - ray emission expected from the forward shock using the synchrotron model described in section 3 .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines are the contributions from the inner and outer jets , respectively .",
    "the model indicates that the flux measured in the chandra observation is consistent with the external shock emission from the outer jet.,width=302 ]    in fig.[fig : xray ] , we plot the x - ray emission expected from the forward shock and compare it with the observed x - ray lightcurve with both swift / xrt and chandra .",
    "the observed x - ray emission at @xmath156 days is much brighter than the model prediction , and exhibits a rapid variability .",
    "this suggest that it is not from the external shock , but likely arises from the internal dissipation of the jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with our arguments in sect.2 to interpret the quasi - periodic variations of x - ray emission .",
    "the rapid decline at @xmath156 days also disfavors the external shock origin of early x - ray emission .",
    "one may therefore conclude that the central engine has been shut off at @xmath157 days ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the last chandra point is somewhat higher than the simple extrapolation of the steep decay phase , but is in excellent agreement with the external forward shock model prediction . from figure",
    "[ fig : xray ] , we can see that this fit would fail without the wide jet .",
    "this result lends further support to our two - component jet model .",
    "in this paper , we study the two quasi - periodic variations ( 200s and 2.7-day ) in the x - ray emission and the rebrightening in late - time radio observations of sw j1644 + 57 . the two quasi - periodic variations with very different periods led us to speculate a two - component jet model .",
    "such a model is also motivated by two natural jet - launching mechanisms , i.e. , the b - z process for powering the jet from the bh horizon and the b - p process for driving an outflow from the warped disk at @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this two - component jet scenario naturally predicts two afterglow components , which nicely interpret the radio data of the source , especially the mysterious re - brightening @xmath1 days after the trigger .",
    "the significant re - brightening in radio emission at @xmath158 days put strong constrains on the single jet model . @xcite and @xcite introduced an energy injection model to interpret this excess .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggested that the radio emitting electrons suffer inverse compton cooling by the x - ray photons passing through the blastwave region . within this scenario , the increase of the effective @xmath110 as the x - ray flux decreases with time ( so that the cooling mechanism weakens ) is responsible for the apparent energy increase in the radio emitting region .",
    "considering that the jet may be magnetically dominated ( @xcite ) , @xcite suggested a narrow poynting flux dominated jet model in which its magnetic energy gradually converts to particle energy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they argued that this model may solve the energy budget problem faced in many other models .",
    "although these models may explain the radio data , the two - component jet model proposed here is a natural one , without the need of invoking a huge energy injection at late times or introducing unconventional ingredients in the afterglow models .",
    "compared with the two - component jet model proposed by @xcite , our model can interpret both the two quasi - periodic variations in x - rays and the entire radio observations ( including data points later than 200 days ) .    since the inner ( b - z ) and outer ( b - p ) jets move relatively with each other through precession and differential motion due to different lorentz factors , dissipations of magnetic energy in both jets are inevitable .",
    "one can speculate two types of interactions .",
    "one is `` collision '' between the inner jet and the outer jet as the former streams into the later , the other is the relative `` shearing '' at the boundary of two jets",
    ". these would induce significant magnetic dissipation , through processes similar to the icmart process envisaged in grbs ( e.g. @xcite ) or something similar to kelvin - helmholtz instability ( in the strongly magnetized regime ) .",
    "it is difficult to quatitatively calculate the strength of such dissipations . on the other hand ,",
    "these dissipation processes provide a natural mechanism to power the observed x - ray emission in the jet .",
    "one may estimate the dissipation efficiency from data , using the x - ray observations and the radio data fits .",
    "the total x - ray energy emitted from sw j1644 + 57 is @xmath159 erg in the 1.35 - 13.5 kev band .",
    "based on our fits to the radio data of sw j1644 + 57 , the total kinetic energy of the outer jet is @xmath160 erg .",
    "the total jet energy can be therefore estimated as @xmath161 erg .",
    "therefore , the magnetic dissipation efficiency could be estimated as @xmath162 .",
    "such an efficiency is quite high , comparable to that of grbs ( e.g. @xcite ) , and consistent with the magnetic jet dissipation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "even though our model can fit most of the data , from fig.[fig_spec ] one can see that it fails to explain the observations around 5 days .",
    "for the light curves , we can not reproduce the sharp peak at @xmath8 days in the 1.8 ghz data . for 4.9 , 6.7 , 8.4 and 15.4 ghz lightcurves ,",
    "our model curves exhibit too sharp peaks .",
    "these discrepancies may arise from the simplified forward shock model we adopted here .    in most previous papers ,",
    "a wind like medium was adopted in the modeling ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a stratified medium profile was introduced to better fit the early - time radio data ( e.g. , metzger et al .",
    "some other authors adopted a constant medium density profile ( e.g. liu et al .",
    "2012 ; zou et al .",
    "in this work , we try to fit the entire radio data set , with focus more on the late - time radio observations .",
    "we find that in general a constant medium density profile provides an overall better fit than the wind - like stratified profile .",
    "it is possible that the medium is stratified nearby the central bh , probably modified by a galactic wind , but becomes a constant density one at larger radii when the influence of the wind becomes negligible .",
    "@xcite suggested that the inverse - compton cooling off the x - ray photons has a significant effect on electrons in the external shock region , which may result in flat light curves in the radio and mm bands .",
    "depending parameters , synchrotron self - compton @xcite can be also important .",
    "on the other hand , we found that both eic and ssc processes do not play an important role in our modeling .",
    "this is because our best fit requires a large @xmath109 .",
    "we have compared the magnetic field energy density with the photon densities in the emission region , and found that in the temporal regimes relevant to the radio observations , the ic processes can be neglected .",
    "however , the early suppression of @xmath163 by eic cooling improves the fit to the infrared observations .    besides the b - p mechanism for launching a jet from the disk , it is possible that an intrinsically episodic jet may be launched from the disk through a magnetic process ( @xcite )",
    "this can also produce variable light curves in x - rays .",
    "we do not discuss this mechanism in this paper .",
    "the rich observations of sw j1644 + 57 allow us to study this tde source with relativistic jet in great detail .",
    "another candidate sw j2058 + 05 shared many similarities with sw j1644 + 57 ( cenko et al .",
    "2012 ) , which deserves further investigation",
    ". there may be also some tdes hidden in the grb samples ( e.g. lu et al .",
