    "colloids are widely used to model atomic systems @xcite .",
    "however , there is one feature specific to colloidal suspensions which distinguishes them fundamentally from atomic systems : the so - called hydrodynamic interactions @xcite . a particle moving in a viscous fluid creates a long - range flow field around itself through which it interacts with other particles .",
    "thus , hydrodynamic interactions constitute a complicated many - body problem since the motion of one particle depends on the translations and rotations of all the other particles in the fluid @xcite .",
    "the central quantities in the description of hydrodynamic interactions are the mobility or friction tensors which connect in a linear response scheme all the forces and torques acting on the particles to their linear and angular velocities @xcite . in the present paper",

    "it is used to determine rheological properties of viscous and viscoelastic media by tracking the trajectory of embedded probe particles and calculating the time - dependent position correlations .",
    "the so - called two - point microrheology employs a system of two colloidal particles , which has several advantages over using only a single particle ; in particular , the correlated motions of two tracer particles reflect the bulk rheology of the medium they are embedded in more accurately @xcite .",
    "many experiments based on this technique have been carried out to study soft media @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this method was used to measure the corrections to the diffusion coefficients in a system of two spheres due to hydrodynamic interactions @xcite and to study the hydrodynamic coupling of two spheres to a wall @xcite .",
    "the physical systems we have in mind are colloidal suspensions of birefringent spherical particles .",
    "e.g. , they are realized by polymerizing the nematic order in liquid - crystal droplets @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional isotropic colloids , both their positions and orientations can be manipulated by optical tweezers . in particular ,",
    "the orientation is controlled with optical traps generated by linearly polarized laser light and is detected , e.g. , with crossed polarizers @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the laser beam of the orientational optical trap is directed along the @xmath0-axis and its polarization points into @xmath1-direction .",

    "pure longitudinal rotational correlations are only observable along the @xmath2-axis . ]    in the present paper , we consider a system of two trapped spheres of equal size . we give a complete analytic description of the coupled translational and rotational dynamics . due to the axial symmetry ,",
    "the longitudinal motions parallel to the particle - particle axis decouple completely from transversal motions .",
    "in addition , there is no coupling of translation and rotation in longitudinal motions .",

    "the correlations for translational motions have already been measured experimentally and compared with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "these works reveal a good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "the correlation functions for rotational motions show the same qualitative behavior ( fig .",

    "the functions are normalized to the mean square angular displacement @xmath169 .",
    "the mobilities were calculated using the numerical library hydrolib @xcite . ]    first of all , we realize that the strength of the cross correlations decreases with increasing particle separation .",
    "this is explained by the decrease of the cross - mobility @xmath170 , which is due to the spatial decay of the flow fields created by the particle rotation .",
    "compared to translational motions , this decrease is more pronounced since rotational flow fields decay stronger than their translational counterparts .",
    "secondly , while the auto - correlation reveals the typical monotonous decay , the cross - correlation function features an interesting behavior .",
    "it is negative ( denoted as `` anti - correlation '' in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , since the relative modes decay more slowly than the collective ones , as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ subsec : long_modes ] .",
    "therefore , the negative term in the cross - correlation function in the first paragraph dominates .",
    "the most interesting feature of the cross - correlation function is that it exhibits a `` memory effect . ''",
    "it vanishes at @xmath171 , in contrast to what one would initially expect for the instantaneous hydrodynamic forces in stokesian dynamics , and then shows a distinct time - delayed extremum ( located at @xmath172 in fig .",
    "[ fig : correl_long ] ) . this behavior can be understood as follows .",
    "the motion of particle  1 creates a fluid flow which instantaneously reaches particle  2 .",
    "however , due to the trap , particle  2 can only `` react '' in a finite time .",
    "thus , the correlation evolves on a characteristic time scale which is related to the relaxation times and thereby to the trap stiffness .",
    "since the `` memory '' is `` stored '' in the trap , it can not last longer than the typical relaxation time .",
    "hence , the correlation decays to zero for times larger than @xmath172 .    for sufficiently large particle distances ,",
    "the self - mobility @xmath173 is much bigger than the cross - mobility @xmath170 .",
    "then , to leading order , the characteristic time scale is given by the single - particle rotational relaxation time @xmath174 , in analogy to the translational case @xcite .",
    "indeed , according to fig .",
    "[ fig : correl_long ] , @xmath172 depends only very weakly on the particle distance . nevertheless , the cross - mobility @xmath170 is sufficiently large to separate the two time scales @xmath175 and @xmath176 , which is the origin of the `` anti - correlation '' .",
    "the transversal eigenmodes are characterized by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : evec / eval_trans_12 ] ) and ( [ eq : evec / eval_trans_34 ] ) .",
    "since the two types of eigenvectors are orthogonal to each other , i.e. , @xmath177 , the dual vectors @xmath178 are linear combinations of @xmath104 and @xmath102 only ; the equivalent holds for @xmath179 .",
    "one finds @xmath180 where the index combinations are @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 .",
    "the correlation functions for the coordinates @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm_correl ] ) .",
    "now , they are linear combinations of four exponential decays .    the auto - correlation functions @xmath189 and @xmath190 show qualitatively the same monotonous decay as in the case of longitudinal fluctuations ( see fig .  [ fig : correl_long ] ) .",
    "all the other correlation functions exhibit the features of the longitudinal cross - correlation discussed in sec .",

    "the most striking feature is revealed by the mixed self - correlation . for a single sphere , translation and rotation",
    "are not coupled @xcite , i.e. , the mixed ( self-)correlation vanishes . however , in the two - sphere system , there exists a mixed self - correlation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : correl_trans ] , that is mediated by the neighboring particle .",
    "this correlation is weaker than the mixed cross - correlation since the flow field created by particle  1 has to be reflected by particle  2 . as discussed before , particle  2 `` reacts '' with a finite delay due to the trap stiffness .",
    "then , in addition , particle  1 also has a finite `` reaction time . ''",
    "hence , we always expect @xmath197 .",
    "we also studied the influence of the trap stiffnesses @xmath72 and @xmath73 on the correlation functions .",

    "note that the mixed self - correlations can not be treated within the rotne - prager approximation .",

    "in this paper , we have presented the complete solution for the hydrodynamically coupled translational and rotational motions of two colloidal spheres that are harmonically trapped with respect to both their positions and orientations .",
    "based on pure symmetry arguments and without relying on explicit values of the mobilities , we have determined all the 12 collective eigenmodes and qualitatively discussed their relaxation times . whereas the properties of the longitudinal modes are reminiscent to a system with pure translational degrees of freedom , the transversal modes exhibit a characteristic coupling of translation and rotation .    in a detailed langevin - type analysis , we have been able to derive the full set of correlation functions characterizing the brownian motion of the particles in the optical traps .",
    "the analysis relies on the eigenvalue problem of nonsymmetric matrices .",
    "explicit examples for the correlation functions at different particle separations have been calculated based on mobilities which we obtained from the numerical library hydrolib @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal fluctuations exhibit the features already mentioned in refs .",
    "@xcite , namely a `` memory effect '' in the cross - correlations .",
    "the transversal fluctuations are governed by the coupling of translations and rotations . as the most striking feature , this coupling is also visible in the self - correlations which are governed by a second delay time in addition to the one observed in the cross - correlations .",
    "the self - coupling of translation and rotation for one sphere has to be mediated by a second sphere .",
    "it is not included in the rotne - prager approximation and therefore introduces an additional effect of higher order .",
    "correlation functions involving the rotational degrees of freedom are weaker compared to pure translational correlations since the flow field of a single rotating sphere decays as @xmath205 , compared to translating particles where the decay is @xmath206 .",
    "however , the strength of the correlations increases for decreasing particle separation which is more pronounced whenever rotations are involved .",
    "furthermore , at sufficiently small distances , lubrication theory becomes important @xcite , and the system introduced in this paper may help to check its predictions .",
    "our work stresses the rotational degree of freedom and its influence on hydrodynamic interactions .",
