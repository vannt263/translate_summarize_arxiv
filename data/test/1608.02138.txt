    "quantum chaos began as an attempt to find chaos , in the sense of extreme sensitivity to changes in initial conditions , in quantum mechanical systems .",
    "the most natural guess would be that chaos would appear in the quantum realm in much the same way as it appears in the classical one , namely in the form of sensitive dependence on initial conditions .",
    "however , the laws of quantum mechanics do not permit a similar definition , since the laws do not show an exponential sensitivity to the initial conditions .",
    "so it boosts this question , how does classical chaos emerge from a quantum system ? are there any signatures of chaos in a quantum system whose classical counterpart is chaotic?@xcite    over recent decades , researchers have gained some important insights about the relationship between quantum mechanics and classical chaos .",
    "one of the most solid conclusions concern the statistical properties of the energy levels of large quantum systems@xcite , such as heavy atomic nuclei@xcite .",
    "if a classical non - chaotic system is quantized , the resulting discrete energy values ( eigenvalues ) tend to cluster , while eigenvalues in quantum systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic typically repel each other and tend to be distributed more uniformly within the available energy range .",
    "the general integrable systems have the poisson distribution of energy level spacing , which implies the existence of many degenerate eigenenergies . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum chaotic systems have the wigner - dyson distribution of energy level spacing .",
    "the wigner - dyson distribution has two main features : zero probability at zero energy level spacing and a peak at a finite energy level spacing .",
    "the former feature means that there is a little degeneracy while the latter implies that there are a large number of energy level spacings around the peak value .",
    "these signatures of chaos have been experimentally observed in the energy levels obtained from molecular and atomic spectra@xcite .",
    "low - dimensional many body quantum systems , specially , spin-1/2 chains , are very good candidates@xcite for studying quantum chaos .",
    "it is known that the level spacing distribution for the integrable xxz chain is poissonian@xcite for all values of the anisotropy parameter , apart from some special ones that may lead to excessive degeneracies@xcite . in 2004",
    ", santos showed that a transition to the chaotic phase happens with the addition of a single defect in the spin-1/2 xxz chain model@xcite .",
    "one should note that , an open chain with defects only on edges is not chaotic .",
    "in addition , studies show that the transition to chaos can also be achieved with onsite disorder @xcite , by increasing the strength of the next - nearest neighbor interaction@xcite , or by coupling a second chain@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , motivated by some recent experimental realization of spin - orbit coupled optical lattices for both fermions@xcite and bosons@xcite , author in ref[@xcite ] synthesize spin - orbit and zeeman coupling into an effective hamiltonian for bosons and spin-1/2 fermions in optical lattices .",
    "it is shown that spin - orbit coupling leads to an effective in - plane dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) term , which its strength predicted of the same order as the heisenberg coupling constant . moreover , with the advent of experiments on optical lattices ( which mimic the lattices in real materials ) , can enable to explore condensed matter phenomena in a controlled and almost pure environment .",
    "the general hope is to be able to simulate interesting many - body systems beyond the reach of state - of - the art numerical methods and to find answers to so far unsolved questions of the field .    in this work",
    ", we explore whether the onset of chaos can also take place in spin-1/2 systems if one includes also the dm interaction . from a physical point of view , this interaction is one of the agents responsible for magnetic frustration .",
    "since this interaction may induce spiral spin arrangements in the ground state , it is closely involved with ferroelectricity in multiferroic spin chains@xcite . moreover , the dm interaction modifies the dynamic properties and the quantum entanglement of spin chains@xcite .",
    "ising model with the dm interaction was extensively studied@xcite .",
    "we consider the three limits of the 1d heisenberg model , namely the ising , xx , and xxz models .",
    "they have been previously explored before in the context of quantum chaos and quantum information @xcite .",
    "we analyze the effects of the dm interaction on these models with focus on the level spacing statistics and localization in real space . using exact diagonalization",
    ", we find that the ising and xxz models can develop chaos , but the same does not happen for the xx model . in terms of localization",
    "we find the structures of the eigenstates in real space are very similar when the system is chaotic , but differ in the integrable limit .",
    "we also address the relationship between chaos and quantum thermalization in isolated interacting many - body systems based on eigenstate thermalization hypothesis(eth ) .",
    "it is found that the onset of chaos is intimately related with the viability of thermalization and this indicates that the eth should be valid in the chaotic domain .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ( ii ) , we summarize the model hamiltonian . in section ( iii ) , the approach and formalism are addressed . in section ( iv ) , we present our numerical results . finally , the conclusion is given in section ( v ) .",
    "we consider a spin-1/2 chain with only nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian of the anisotropic xxz model in a uniform magnetic field ( _ h _ ) with added the dm interaction and an open boundary chain of length _",
    "l _ , is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 are spin-1/2 operators on the n - th site .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are the antiferromagnetic ( af ) coupling constants .",
    "@xmath4 is the flip - flop coupling and responsible for propagating the excitation through the chain .",
    "a spin pointing up corresponds to an excitation .",
    "@xmath5 is the ising coupling .",
    "we work with an anisotropic chain , that is , the coupling constant @xmath4 for the @xmath6 type interaction is different to the coupling constant @xmath5 for diagonal ising interaction .",
    "the term @xmath7 gives the zeeman splitting of each spin @xmath8 subjected to a magnetic field in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "a defect corresponds to the site which has a larger zeeman splitting @xmath10 ) an it is caused by a magnetic field slightly larger than the field applied on the other sites . in the case @xmath11 , the chain is ideal because all sites have the same energy splitting .",
    "it is also worth to address some characteristics of the ising and xxz models compare with the xx model , regarding to the dm interaction . using the raising and lowering operators , @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ", one can rewrite the interaction part of the eq.([hamiltonian ] ) as @xmath14 .",
    "it is clear that the dm interaction adds some anisotropic features to the system due to the absences of inversion symmetry .",
    "so , the @xmath15 model changes to the @xmath16 model .",
    "nevertheless , the diagonal ising interaction term which favors localization exists without any modification and just the off - diagonal terms modified which favors to propagate excitation and consequently induce delocalization .    in this model",
    ", eq .  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the total spin in the @xmath9 direction , @xmath17 , is conserved : @xmath18=0 $ ] , so states with different @xmath19 are not coupled . to obtain the level spacing distribution , we focus on a particular subspace of the hamiltonian with size @xmath20 , namely subspaces with @xmath21 spins up and @xmath22 eigenvalues .",
    "theoretically , in the simplest case of the xxz spin chain with nearest - neighbor interaction and in the absence of the defect , @xmath11 , and the dm interaction , @xmath23 , the model is integrable and it can be analytically solved using the bethe ansatz@xcite .",
    "we also recall the behavior of the model in the absence of the dm interaction , @xmath24 , but with the presence of a defect , @xmath25 , reported by gubin et al.@xcite and for an isotropic chain by santos@xcite . depending on the conditions",
    "bellow , the system defined by eq.([hamiltonian ] ) in the absence of the dm interaction can be chaotic :    * the strength of the ising interaction can not be much larger than xy - type coupling * the defect can not be placed on the edges of the chain@xcite * we can not have defect energy much larger than flip - flop coupling .",
    "the source of quantum chaos is the competition between the ising interaction , the off - diagonal terms and the defect@xcite .",
    "to discriminate between the chaotic and the integrable behavior of the system under consideration , one should work with some tools .",
    "below , we give a concise explanation about our toolkit to deal with this problem .",
    "the first choice is the level spacing statistics which we have addressed in the introduction .",
    "but one notes that some extra manipulations are needed to harness the level spacing as a good tool to quantify the crossover from integrability to quantum chaos . to find universal statistics within each invariant subspace ,",
    "it is necessary to to unfold the spectrum , which consists of locally rescaling the eigenvalues @xmath26 so that the mean level density of the unfolded eigenvalues is equal to unity .",
    "there are different standard numerical unfolding procedures .",
    "one of these procedures is explained with details in ref .",
    "we consider the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution ( nnsd ) @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the spacing between consecutive unfolded eigenvalues . for a quantum integrable system",
    "whose energy levels are not correlated , the distribution is typically poissonian , @xmath29 , while for chaotic quantum system whose energy levels are correlated and crossing are avoided , the level spacing distribution is characterized by the wigner - dyson surmise , @xmath30 , the wigner surmise for ensembles with time reversal invariance ( goe ) .",
    "our second choice is the number of principal components ( npc ) .",
    "contrary to the previous tool , the npc exploits the eigenstates statistics . for eigenstate @xmath31 ,",
    "the npc is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the basis vectors .",
    "the npc is a tool to measure the spreadness of eigenstates in the chosen basis .",
    "indeed , this quantity gives the numbers of basis vectors that contribute to each eigenstate .",
    "it is small when the state is localized localized , in which case there are a few number of non - zero components cin .",
    "it is large when the state is delocalized , in which case a large portion of the components are non - zero .",
    "complete delocalization occurs for gaussian orthogonal ensembles ( goe ) , where the eigenstates are random vectors , that is , the coefficients @xmath34 are independent random variables from a gaussian distribution , the average over the ensemble leads to the number of principal components , @xmath35 , @xmath36@xcite .",
    "note , the choice of basis is essential for studying the structure of the eigenstates , so we use the configuration space basis , which is also known as the site - basis@xcite .",
    "the site - basis vectors @xmath33 correspond to states where the spin on each sith either pionts down or up along the @xmath9-axis as @xmath37 .      in order to check the relationship between quantum chaos and quantum thermalization",
    ", we study the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) .",
    "several theoretical works have focused on the question of thermalization in nonintegrable quantum systems@xcite .",
    "it is known that the onset of thermalization in isolated interacting many - body systems is related to a chaotic structure of many - body eigenstates in the selected basis .",
    "according to eth , expectation values of physical observables in energy eigenstates are approximately smooth functions of their energy in the chaotic phase . here",

    "<S> using one - dimensional spin-1/2 systems as prototypes of quantum many - body systems , we study the emergence of quantum chaos . the main purpose of this work is to answer the following question : how does the spin - orbit interaction , as a pure quantum interaction , may lead to the onset of quantum chaos ? </S>",
    "<S> we consider three integrable spin-1/2 systems : the ising , the xx , and the xxz limits , and analyze whether quantum chaos develops or not after the addition of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , depending on the strength of the anisotropy parameter , the answer is positive for the xxz and ising models , while no such evidence is observed for the xx model . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the relationship between quantum chaos and thermalization . </S>",
