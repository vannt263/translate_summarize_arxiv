    "though the standard model ( sm ) is very successful , it possesses many unsatisfactory features .",
    "one of them is the redundancy of the free parameters in the yukawa sector .",
    "there exist ( infinitely ) many physically equivalent yukawa matrices that can produce the same physical quantities , such as the fermion masses and mixings .",
    "since there is no principle to fix the yukawa structure in the sm , the sm must be extended to impose a family symmetry in order to reduce the redundancy of the parameters .",
    "recently , non - abelian discrete symmetries have been used to extend the sm.@xcite    another unsatisfactory feature of the sm is the fine - tuning problem of the higgs mass , which can be softened by supersymmetry ( susy ) . moreover ,",
    "successful gauge coupling unification in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) seems to support the existence of low - energy susy .",
    "however , the situation is not this simple , because susy is broken at low energies .",
    "it is widely believed that to maintain the nice renormalization property of a supersymmetric theory , susy must be broken softly .",
    "it is known that there are more than one hundred soft breaking terms and , unless they are fine - tuned , they create large flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and _ cp _ violations . fortunately , however , this susy flavor problem can be softened by a non - abelian family symmetry.@xcite    the above cited facts suggest that a family symmetry could cure certain pathologies of the sm and mssm .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that a family symmetry consistent at low energies is a remnant of a symmetry of a more fundamental theory .",
    "if this is the case , the symmetry should be anomaly - free , at least at a fundamental scale .",
    "this provides the motivation to investigate anomalies of the discrete family symmetries of recently proposed models . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the anomaly of a discrete symmetry at low energies is canceled by the green - schwarz ( gs ) mechanism @xcite at a more fundamental scale . in this scenario ,",
    "the kac - moody @xmath1 levels play an important role , and if the kac - moody levels assume non - trivial values , the gs cancellation conditions of anomalies modify the ordinary unification of gauge couplings . note that it is impossible to construct a realistic , renormalizable model with a low - energy non - abelian discrete family symmetry in the case of the minimal content of the @xmath2 higgs fields .",
    "however , an extension of the higgs sector may spoil the successful gauge coupling unification of the mssm .",
    "therefore , a possible change of the ordinary unification condition because of the existence of nontrivial kac - moody @xmath1 levels is consistent with the assumption regarding the existence of a low - energy non - abelian discrete family symmetry .",

    "we do this to recall and to demonstrate that the jacobian can be calculated for a finite discrete transformation parameter . in  3 , we use the result of  2 to calculate the jacobian for a non - abelian discrete transformation .",

    "we find that the gs cancellation conditions can be satisfied if @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that the ordinary unification of gauge couplings is inconsistent with the gs conditions , indicating the possible existence of further higgs doublets .",
