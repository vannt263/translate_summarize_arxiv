    "the lattice realization of super yang - mills theory has been considered very difficult though highly desirable as a non - perturbative formulation@xcite . in our previous work and talk @xcite , we reported the presence of exact fermionic symmetries on the ` ichimatsu ' lattice , a novel lattice .",
    "if the symmetries survive in the continuum limit , they would be related to a supersymmetry if not to the brs symmetry .    from the equation",
    "presented shortly , we know that the fermionic symmetries can not survive on the ordinary lattice",
    ". therefore it is of crucial importance to study the continuum limit on the ` ichimatsu ' lattice .",
    "plaquettes on the regular lattice gauge theory are decomposed into two sets :    \\(i ) plaquettes on cell +   @xmath2 on @xmath3 ;    \\(ii ) plaquettes on pipe +   @xmath2 on @xmath4 .",
    "one a @xmath5 plane , one finds an alternating or chequered pattern and it is called as an ` ichimatsu ' pattern @xcite",
    ". the fields of the ichimatsu lattice theory are link variables , @xmath6 , as the gauge field , and a real staggered fermion , @xmath7 , as the fermion field .",
    "the gauge action of our model ( cell+pipe ) is @xmath8    the fermionic symmetry transformation of the fermion field is written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 are grassman - odd parameters .",
    "it should be emphasized that on the usual regular lattice ( @xmath11 ) , the transformation goes down to @xmath12 .",
    "therefore it is important to study the dynamical properties on the two - couplings space ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "from now on , we switch off fermion effects in our model and concentrate on the vacuum structure of the gauge sector .",
    "we take a link variable @xmath13 as a mean field .",
    "this approximation is not gauge - invariant and it is useful only in the first view of the phase diagram .",
    "the results are ( 1 ) there exists an exact duality under @xmath14 , that is , the partition functions are invariant under the interchange of couplings ; @xmath15    \\(2 ) in the cell model ( defined by putting @xmath16 ) and the pipe model ( @xmath17 ) , phase transitions occur .",
