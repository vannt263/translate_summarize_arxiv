    "( only part of which can be accounted for by transforming to the instantaneous eigenmodes , though the definition of instantaneous eigenmodes is a non - trivial task . )",
    "two regimes were identified : firstly , for energies much smaller than the chemical potential , the coupling of different modes is negligible and an effective space - time metric might be introduced for the phase fluctuations .",
    "this , however , necessitates a redefinition of the time coordinate such that the required change of trap frequency and/or interaction strength for a certain dynamics of this effective space - time is not obvious .",
    "it turned out that the sole variation of the interaction coefficient @xmath81 in a smooth monotonic way is hardly sufficient to render the evolution of the quantum fluctuations non - adiabatic , since the expansion / contraction of the background might compensate for changes of @xmath139 such that the sound velocity ( in comoving coordinates ) remains constant .",
    "breathing oscillations of the background , excited , e.g. , by the sudden change of the interaction coefficient @xmath139 , might still yield a notable amount of quasi - particles . and secondly , if the excitation energy is of the same order as the chemical potential , different quasi - particle modes couple .",
    "the amplification and freezing of the fluctuations and also the coupling of different modes was illustrated in an example , where the trap frequency and interaction strength were exponentially ramped down such that the shape of the condensate remains constant .",
    "for the considered parameters , a quasi - particle number of 0.5 was obtained in the lowest mode , though higher occupation numbers could be achieved by faster sweep rates or starting with a higher chemical potential .",
    "the inversion of the occupation number in the next two modes could be attributed to the inter - mode coupling : although the third excitation , @xmath219 , experiences a much briefer period of non - adiabatic evolution than the second mode , @xmath220 , only the former couples to the lowest mode , @xmath216 , and gets populated from it .",
