    "we describe in this paper analysis procedures that can answer two of the most important questions of neutrino research .",
    "how can one determine the total solar neutrino fluxes ( @xmath12 , and @xmath10 ) for comparison with solar model predictions ?",
    "how can one determine the sterile contribution to the total solar neutrino fluxes ?",
    "our answers allow for the possibility of an arbitrary mixture in solar neutrino oscillations of active and sterile neutrinos , but require the correctness of the lma solution of the solar neutrino problems and careful attention to all the sources of error ( theoretical as well as experimental).be and @xmath0b neutrinos are unchanged and the numerical results have not been affected significantly , but the present version is more up - to - date with respect to the input data .",
    "we have also added , inspired by the sage discussion , a detailed analysis of what one can learn about @xmath10 neutrinos before there is a dedicated experiment to measure just the @xmath10 neutrino flux . ]",
    "we focus first on determining total fluxes by comparing charged current ( cc ) observables measured in different experiments ; this method yields results as independent as possible of uncertainties due to the presence of sterile neutrinos .",
    "we then describe how similar techniques can be applied to determine total solar neutrino fluxes using a cc experiment plus a neutrino - electron scattering experiment [ or a neutral current ( nc ) measurement ] , which yields results that depend more on the sterile neutrino mix but which can nevertheless be relatively accurate .",
    "the numerical values we estimate for the expected precision with which different quantities can be measured rely upon simulations of the performance of the relevant experiments .",
    "therefore the accuracies that we quote are illustrative ; the actual accuracies that are obtainable can only be determined once the experimental uncertainties are known .",
    "neutrinos change flavors as they travel to the earth from the center of the sun .",
    "this flavor change was seen directly by the comparison of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) measurement  @xcite of the charged current reaction for @xmath0b solar neutrinos with the super - kamiokande measurement  @xcite of the neutrino - electron scattering rate ( charged plus neutral current ) .",
    "even more clearly , flavor change has been demonstrated by comparing the neutral current measurement by sno with the sno cc measurement  @xcite .",
    "the conclusion that flavor changes occur among solar neutrinos , if based solely upon the comparison of the sno and super - kamiokande event rates , is valid statistically at about the @xmath13 confidence level  @xcite .",
    "the neutral current measurement of sno increases the significance level for flavor changes among solar neutrinos to the @xmath14 confidence level .",
    "the sno and super - kamiokande results demonstrate simply that new physics is required to resolve the long - standing solar neutrino problem  @xcite , i.e. , to understand the origin of the discrepancy between the predictions of the standard solar model  @xcite and the observed solar neutrino event rates @xcite .",
    "if one includes the results of the chlorine @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , sage @xcite , gallex @xcite , and gno @xcite experiments together with the sno ( cc ) and super - kamiokande results , then the combined measurements require  @xcite new physics at @xmath15 and , if the relative temperature scaling of the @xmath8be and @xmath0b neutrino production reactions is taken into account , at @xmath16 .",
    "helioseismological measurements confirm the predicted sound speeds of the standard solar model to better than @xmath17% and show that stellar physics can not account for the discrepancies between standard predictions and the observed solar neutrino rates  @xcite .      the combination of the charged current ( cc ) and the charged plus neutral - current measurement with super - kamiokande has been used by several groups  @xcite to determine the flux of active @xmath0b neutrinos independent of the solar model .",
    "these model - independent determinations of the active flux exploit the similarity between the response functions in the sno and super - kamiokande detectors  @xcite .",
    "in addition , if one includes all the experimental data in a global oscillation solution in which the @xmath0b flux is a free parameter , one obtains a similar ( but slightly smaller ) allowed range for the @xmath0b neutrino flux  @xcite . the measurement of the nc rate by sno  @xcite provides an independent determination of the active @xmath0b neutrino flux .",
    "all of the analyses yield the same result : if electron neutrinos oscillate into only active neutrinos , then the total @xmath0b neutrino flux is in excellent agreement with the flux predicted by the standard solar model .",
    "this close agreement of the active @xmath0b neutrino flux with the total flux predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm )  @xcite is , if the flux of sterile neutrinos is small , an important confirmation of the quantitative theory of stellar evolution .",

    "what is the situation if sterile neutrinos exist ?",
    "the total flux of @xmath0b neutrinos could in this case be much larger than the standard solar model prediction ; a major fraction of the total flux that reaches the earth could arrive in a form that is not detected in solar neutrino experiments .",
    "the existing data disfavor ( at @xmath23 cl ) oscillation into purely sterile neutrinos .",
    "nevertheless , a large sterile component is allowed  @xcite if oscillations occur into a combination of active and sterile neutrino states ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a description of the formalism adopted here ) .",
    "the flux of sterile neutrinos could in principle be large enough to destroy the apparently excellent agreement between the flux predicted by the ssm and the true flux of @xmath0b neutrinos [ which is assumed to be pure active neutrinos in the comparison shown above in eqs .",

    "the kamland reactor neutrino experiment  @xcite , when combined with the sno measurement of the cc flux , is capable of providing a precise determination of the total , i.e. the active plus the sterile , @xmath0b neutrino flux .",
    "we assume throughout this paper the correctness of the currently favored large mixing angle ( lma ) solution to the solar neutrino problem . if the lma solution is not correct , then all global analyses of the available solar and reactor data indicate that either the mass difference , @xmath24 , or the vacuum mixing angle , @xmath25 , will be too small to produce a measurable effect in the kamland experiment ( see e.g. refs .",

    "figure  [ fig : solarvskamlandreal ] shows clearly that kamland has the potential for making a precise measurement of the solar neutrino oscillation parameters , provided that the lma is the correct oscillation solution .    the only complication involved in determining the total @xmath0b flux from a comparison of the kamland and sno cc measurements results from the fact that for the favored large mixing angle ( lma ) solar neutrino oscillation solution matter effects in the sun and the earth can be significant .",
    "matter effects are unimportant for the kamland reactor experiment .",
    "the role of matter effects in solar neutrino experiments depends somewhat upon the _ a priori _ unknown active - sterile mixture , which introduces a calculable uncertainty in the inferred total @xmath0b neutrino flux .    in summary",

    "the flux of @xmath8be solar neutrinos , which in the ssm is predicted@xcite to be @xmath36 , can be determined in a model independent way from a global analysis of the solar neutrino data assuming only active neutrino oscillations . for example , the latest analysis by garzelli and giunti  @xcite yields @xmath37 at 99% cl .",
    "we shall also show in this paper that one can extract the value of the @xmath8be neutrino flux from measurements of the gallium solar neutrino experiments , gallex , sage , and gno and the results of the sno and kamland measurements .",

    "<S> the @xmath0b solar neutrino flux inferred from a global analysis of solar neutrino experiments is within @xmath1% ( @xmath2 ) of the predicted standard solar model value if only active neutrinos exist , but could be as large as @xmath3 times the standard prediction if sterile neutrinos exist . we show that the total @xmath0b neutrino flux ( active plus sterile neutrinos ) can be determined experimentally to about @xmath4% ( @xmath2 ) by combining charged current measurements made with the kamland reactor experiment and with the sno cc solar neutrino experiment , provided the lma neutrino oscillation solution is correct and the simulated performance of kamland is valid . including also sno nc data , the sterile component of the @xmath0b neutrino flux can be measured by this method to an accuracy of about @xmath5% ( @xmath2 ) of the standard solar model flux . </S>",
    "<S> combining super - kamiokande and kamland measurements and assuming the oscillations occur only among active neutrinos , the @xmath0b neutrino flux can be measured to @xmath6% ( @xmath2 ) ; the total flux can be measured to an accuracy of about @xmath7% . </S>",
    "<S> the total @xmath8be solar neutrino flux can be determined to an accuracy of about @xmath9% ( @xmath2 ) by combining measurements made with the kamland , sno , and gallium neutrino experiments . </S>",
    "<S> one can determine the total @xmath8be neutrino flux to a @xmath2 accuracy of about @xmath1% or better by comparing data from the kamland experiment and the borexino solar neutrino experiment provided both detectors work as expected . </S>",
