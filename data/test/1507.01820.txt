    "networks play a role in several of the major contenders for a theory of quantum geometries . in the spin foam approach @xcite to loop quantum gravity @xcite spin networks represent the quantum states of the gravity on a given manifold . in the causal dynamical triangulation approach ( cdt ) @xcite , triangulations of space - time play the role of a lattice regularization of the einstein - hilbert action used to search for a non - trivial ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalization group fixed point defining quantum gravity in a non - perturbative sense , an approach that goes under the name of asymptotic safety @xcite",
    ". causal sets @xcite and energetic causal sets @xcite are attempt to build geometries from networks of causal relations .",
    "quantum graphity models @xcite attempt the same starting from graphs . finally , a very recent approach @xcite is the idea of considering discrete space - time as a quantum network , obtained by growing simplicial complexes .",
    "in a recent publication @xcite i proposed a different approach to quantum gravity in which networks play an even greater role .",
    "the idea is to turn things around and , instead of starting from the correct infrared ( ir ) geometric variables and use discrete space - time just as a regularization artefact , as in the cdt approach , to posit purely combinatoric information bits as the fundamental uv quantum variables of gravity and have these self - organize so that geometry and general relativity emerge .",
    "of course this presupposes the existence of a model having an uv fixed point corresponding to disordered bits and an ir limit in which vertices and edges self - organize to form a network with the topology of discrete space - time .",
    "in @xcite i have proposed exactly such a model , suitably generalizing kazakov s famed random lattice ising model @xcite . as i have shown in @xcite",
    "there is ample numerical and analytical evidence supporting the fact that the hausdorff dimension of the emergent space - time in this model is _ predicted _ to be 4 , the upper critical dimension of the ising model @xcite .",
    "this model distinguishes itself from previous approaches in two major respects .",
    "first of all , it is much more radical , in the sense that no constraints at all , like the requirements of triangulations , causal sprinklings of lorentz manifolds or simplicial complexes , are imposed on the discrete basic structure : this is completely determined by self - organization driven by a minimum energy principle alone .",
    "secondly , nothing is assumed a priori about time : contrary to most previous authors i believe time should not be assumed by imposing causality from the very beginning , but should be , rather , `` explained '' by the model itself . admittedly , though , i am still quite short of this goal . the idea , however , is to explore if space - time can emerge from the simplest combinatoric variables with no other driving force than the competition arising from frustrated ising hamiltonians .",
    "the model is formulated in terms of @xmath3 spin 1/2 bits @xmath4 , @xmath5 , whose values indicate the presence / absence of ( euclidean ) space - time , respectively and @xmath6 symmetric spin 1/2 bits @xmath7 , @xmath8 , whose values denote a connection ( 1 ) between space - time vertices @xmath9 and @xmath10 or the absence thereof ( 0 ) ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the unique dimensionless coupling .",
    "i use units in which @xmath14 , @xmath15 and all energies are measured in units of the standard ising coupling , second term in ( [ one ] ) , which is set to one for simplicity of presentation .",
    "the second term in this energy function is the standard ferromagnetic ising model .",
    "if the links @xmath16 would be uniformly drawn from random adjacency matrices of degree 4 , the model would be exactly kazakov s random lattice ising model in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the first term in the energy function , on the other side , is simply a nearest - neighbours ( sharing a common vertex ) antiferromagnetic ising model for the link spins .",
    "the generalizations with respect to kazakov s model , thus consist in dropping the restriction to degree 4 and drawing the random adjacency matrices from a gaussian distribution .",
    "the driver of self - organization in this model is the competition between the vertex ferromagnetic coupling and the link antiferromagnetic one , creating `` link frustration '' .",
    "indeed the vertex ferromagnetic coupling favours the creation of many links ( in a vertex aligned configuration ) while the antiferromagnetic link coupling tends to suppress such links . as i have shown in @xcite , for @xmath17",
    ", with integer @xmath18 , the compromise is a @xmath19-regular ground state graph with power - law extension , exactly what one would expect for a discretized space - time .",
    "the spectral and hausdorff dimensions @xcite of this  space - time graph \" are determined by the unique dimensionless coupling @xmath13 of the model .",
    "the spectral dimension is simply @xmath18 while all evidence supports the fixed value 4 for the hausdorff dimension @xmath20 in the whole range of couplings between the two quantum phase transitions at @xmath21 , corresponding to the lower critical dimension of the ising model , where space - time vertices themselves become disordered and @xmath22 , the upper critical dimension of the ising model where spectral and hausdorff dimension start to coincide .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to solve a simplified version of ( [ one ] ) in the mean field approximation to elucidate the nature of the upper phase transition with disorder parameter ( @xmath23 ) and to show how critical graphs with long - range correlations and power - law extension emerge as a result of frustrated edge antiferromagnetism .    near the upper transition",
    "all space - time vertices are aligned .",
    "i will thus assume a configuration with @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "in this case the model ( [ one ] ) reduces to a dynamical graph problem with an edge hamiltonian @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote edges emanating from vertex @xmath29 . in this case",
    "the frustration reduces to the competition between the edge antiferromagnetic interaction ( first term ) and an external edge  magnetic field \" generated by the aligned space - time vertices ( second term ) . in this space - time - aligned phase",
    ", the model can be thought of as being defined on the complete graph on @xmath3 vertices , the ( + 1 ) edges defining a dynamically generated subgraph representing the emergent space - time .",
    "the connectivity of this subgraph is dynamically determined by the coupling constant @xmath13 : for @xmath17 with integer @xmath18 the subgraph is @xmath19-regular .",
    "the toy model i will consider in this paper is defined by the same hamiltonian ( [ two ] ) but restricted on a connected , bipartite @xmath19-regular graph , while @xmath13 is left free .",
    "as i will now show , this model is solvable in the mean field approximation .    as a first step",
    "i will introduce a more familiar notation by defining standard spins @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ two ] ) reduces then to @xmath32    the second step is to invoke knig s edge colouring theorem @xcite , which states that the edge chromatic number of any bipartite graph equals its maximum vertex degree , in this case @xmath19 since the graph is assumed @xmath19-regular .",
    "this means that at every vertex one can colour the incident edges with exactly @xmath19 different colours , without two edges of the same colour ever touching .",
    "let me now further subdivide the @xmath19 colours into two types of light and dark colours : at every vertex there will be exactly @xmath18 light colours and @xmath18 dark colours .",
    "exactly like one standardly treats antiferromagnets on bipartite lattices by introducing two different magnetizations for the two sub - lattices i will consider configurations with two different magnetizations @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( defined as usual between -1 and 1 ) for the two types of edge colours and define @xmath35 as the magnetization and the staggered magnetization , respectively .",
    "the original @xmath19-regular graph corresponds clearly to a maximally  ferromagnetic configuration \" @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the maximally  antiferromagnetic configuration \" @xmath38 , @xmath39 , instead corresponds to a regular connected sub - graph . in between these two extremes",
    "there are intermediate configurations in which each dark - coloured edge has a probability @xmath40 of being present in the graph , whereas the probability for light - coloured edges is @xmath41 .",
    "in the mean field approximation i will decompose each edge spin into its mean value @xmath42 and a fluctuation around it : @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and neglect terms quadratic in the fluctuations in the hamiltonian , so that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the inverse temperature and @xmath47    at this point one can compute exactly the free energy per edge ( a @xmath19-regular graph on @xmath3 vertices has @xmath48 edges by the degree sum formula ) .",
    "@xmath49 i will consider first the ansatz of configurations with exactly @xmath18 edges of mean @xmath34 and @xmath18 edges of mean @xmath33 at every vertex .",
