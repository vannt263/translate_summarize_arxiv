    "turbulent aerosols are of interest in a variety of natural and technological systems .",
    "two very important examples are water droplets in turbulent rain clouds @xcite and dust grains in turbulent accretion disks around growing stars @xcite . in both of these systems",
    "the aerosol is unstable because the suspended particles collide ( leading to aggregation or possibly fragmentation of the aerosol particles ) .",
    "the collision processes therefore have significant consequences : the formation of rain in one case , and the widely hypothesised mechanism for the formation of planets in the other .",
    "collisions always occur due to molecular diffusion , but ( as pointed out by smoluchowski @xcite ) , macroscopic fluid motion can considerably increase the collision rate .    if the suspended particles are sufficiently heavy ( so that their inertia becomes relevant ) , they can move relative to the fluid . in this case the occurrence of caustics will typically increase the collision rate by several orders of magnitude @xcite . if the aerosol particles are sufficiently light , their molecular diffusion can make a significant contribution to the collision rate , which can be estimated by standard kinetic theory .",
    "in this paper we are concerned with the effect of macroscopic motion of a fluid on small particles which have insignificant inertia , so that they follow the flow ( advective motion ) .",
    "the seminal papers in this area were due to smoluchowski @xcite , who first considered the effect of shear of the fluid flow on collisions , and saffman & turner @xcite , who gave a formula for the collision rate which has formed the basis for most subsequent work on this problem .",
    "their paper was motivated by a problem in meteorology argued that small - scale turbulence in convecting clouds can accelerate collisions between microscopic water droplets , thus initiating rain formation : in this case the particles are brought into contact by hyperbolic or shearing motions of the turbulent flow .    the formula for the collision rate by saffman & turner @xcite has been used frequently in the past five decades in cloud physics and in chemical engineering problems .",
    "it appears to be widely accepted that their expression is an exact relation for the collision rate in a dilute suspension . in the following",
    "we show that the saffman - turner estimate describes an initial transient of the problem only . for particles suspended in incompressible flows",
    ", the collision rate falls below the initial transient ( which thus constitutes an upper bound ) . for particles advected in a compressible flows , however ,",
    "homogeneously distributed particles will cluster in a compressible fluid ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the clustering may increase the collision rate beyond its initial transient .",
    "the saffman - turner approximation treats the flow surrounding a test particle as if it were a steady hyperbolic flow , while in reality the flow fluctuates as a function of time . in section [ sec",
    ": 3.2 ] below we give an extension of the saffman - turner formula which does give the collision rate exactly .",
    "unfortunately the formula contains information about the time - dependence of the flow , and it is impossible to evaluate it in the general case .    because of the importance of understanding collision rates for aerosol particles , it is desirable to find exactly solvable cases which can be used as a benchmark for numerical studies . the collision rate must depend on a dimensionless parameter describing how quickly the fluid velocity fluctuates , the kubo number @xcite .",
    "we are able to obtain precise asymptotic results on the collision rate in the limit where the kubo number approaches zero . in this case ,",
    "particle separations undergo a diffusion process . by solving the corresponding fokker - planck equation we can determine the collision rate exactly .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : 2 ] we introduce the equations of motion and the dimensionless parameters of the problem .",
    "section [ sec : 3 ] discusses the saffman - turner theory and our extension of it . section [ sec : 3.1 ] describes the expression for the collision rate given in @xcite which is the starting point of our discussions . ( some new results on the evaluation of the saffman - turner expression are described in the appendix ) . in section [ sec : 3.2 ] we discuss our exact formula for the collision rate , and explain why the saffman - turner approximation describes an initial transient only . in sections [ sec : 4]-[sec : 6 ]",
    "we discuss how exact asymptotic results may be found for the limit of small kubo number .",
    "a fokker - planck equation for the probability density of the separation of particles is described in section [ sec : 4 ] . in section [ sec : 5 ] this is used to obtain the steady - state collision rate and section [ sec : 6 ] gives the full time dependence of the collision rate .",
    "these results are compared to numerical simulations in section [ sec : 7 ] , which also contains some concluding remarks , discussing scope for further work in this area .",
    "finally , we remark that a brief summary of some of the results of this paper has already been published @xcite . here",
    "we discuss the problem in greater depth and generality , and derive expressions for the time - dependent collision rate which were not discussed in @xcite .",
    "we consider spherical particles of radius @xmath0 in a fluid with velocity field @xmath1 which has an apparently random motion , usually as a result of turbulence .",
    "we assume that the suspended particles do not modify the surrounding flow .",
    "when the inertia of the particles is negligible , they are advected by the flow : @xmath2 it is assumed that direct interactions between the particles can be neglected until they collide . in other words ,",
    "the particles follow equation ( [ eq : 2.1 ] ) until their separation falls below @xmath3 .",
    "we model the complex flow of a turbulent fluid by a random velocity field @xmath4 .",
    "we consider flows in both two and three spatial dimensions and for convenience we use a gaussian distributed field when we carry through concrete computations . in most cases we are concerned with incompressible flow , satisfying @xmath5 .",
    "particles floating on the surface of a fluid may experience a partly compressible flow @xcite , as may particles in gases moving with speeds comparable to the speed of sound .",
    "for these reasons we also consider partially compressible flows .",
    "it is convenient to construct the random velocity field @xmath1 from scalar stream functions or potentials @xcite . in two spatial dimensions",
    "we write @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a normalisation factor and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are independent gaussian random functions .",
    "we shall use angle brackets to denote averaging throughout .",
    "the fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 have zero averages , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and they both have same correlation function , @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this two - point correlation function @xmath14 is a smooth function decaying ( sufficiently rapidly ) to zero for large values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the flow ( [ eq : 2.2 ] ) is incompressible . for finite values of @xmath21",
    "it acquires a compressible component . in the limit of @xmath22",
    "the flow is purely potential . in some cases",
    "the physics of a problem dictates that @xmath8 and @xmath9 should have different correlation functions ; many of our results can be generalised in this way .",
    "in three spatial dimensions we write @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath9 are four independent scalar fields with zero mean and with the same correlation function @xmath14 ; and @xmath25 is a normalisation factor .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "we choose the normalisation factors to be of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the standard deviation of the magnitude of the velocity and @xmath28 denotes the second derivative of the correlation function ( [ eq : 2.3 ] ) with respect to its first argument .",
    "fully - developed turbulent flows have a power - law spectrum in the inertial range , covering a wide band of wavenumbers @xcite .",
    "this feature can be incorporated by giving @xmath14 a suitable algebraic behaviour over a range of values of @xmath18 , as explained in @xcite .",
    "the long - ranged behaviour of the velocity field is not , however , relevant to the advective collision mechanism .",
    "it therefore suffices to consider a model with a short - ranged velocity correlation : for the numerical work reported in this paper we used following form of the correlation function @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant . in our numerical simulations",
    "we represent the flow field by its fourier components which are subject to an ornstein - uhlenbeck process as suggested by sigurgeirson & stuart @xcite .",
    "lc + & + particle size & @xmath0 + typical velocity fluctuation & @xmath27 + correlation length of the flow & @xmath31 + correlation time of the flow & @xmath32 + number density of particles & @xmath33 + compressibility & @xmath21 + spatial dimension & @xmath34 +   +    our problem is characterised by the six parameters listed in table [ tab:1 ] . from the parameters in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] , three independent dimensionless combinations can be formed : @xmath35 the first parameter characterises the dimensionless speed of the flow and is called kubo number , discussed in @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath36 is not possible , because the motion of the fluid places an upper limit on the correlation time .",
    "steady , fully developed turbulence corresponds to @xmath37 .",
    "the kubo number can be small for randomly stirred fluids .",
    "it is only in the limit @xmath38 that we are able to obtain precise and explicit estimates for the collision rate : this case is considered in sections [ sec : 4]-[sec : 6 ] . the second parameter in ( [ eq : 2.7 ] ) is the packing fraction of particles .",
    "throughout we assume that this parameter is small .",
    "similarly , the third parameter in ( [ eq : 2.7 ] ) is usually taken to be small .",
    "we note that kalda @xcite has considered the collision rate for particles in a non - smooth velocity field : this could be relevant to the case where @xmath39 .",
    "throughout this paper we consider the rate of collision of a given particle with any other particle , denoting this by @xmath40 .",
    "some papers consider the total rate of collision per unit volume . if the spatial density of particles is @xmath33 , the total rate of collision per unit volume is @xmath41 ( the factor of @xmath42 avoids double - counting ) .",
    "we will not be concerned with what happens after particles undergo their first collision : in different physical circumstances they may coalesce , scatter , or fragment , but in this paper we are concerned only with their first contact .",
    "we assume that the particles are spherical ( or circular , in two - dimensional calculations ) and that they all have the same radius , @xmath0 .",
    "we regard the particles as having collided when their separation reaches @xmath3 , and we neglect effects due to the interaction of the particles and the fluid . in practice",
    "the fluid trapped between approaching particles may slightly reduce the collision rate @xcite , but this effect can be accounted for by replacing the radius by an effective radius .",
    "the problem of calculating the rate of collision therefore reduces to the following problem .",
    "we consider a given particle , and transform to a frame where the centre of this particle is at the origin , and the separation of the centre of another particle is denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "initially , the reference particle is surrounded by a gas of particles with spatial density @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that these are initially randomly distributed , apart from the constraint that none of the particles is in contact with the reference particle .",
    "collisions with the test particle occur when other particles come within a radius @xmath3 of the reference particle .",
    "the rate of collisions is therefore the rate at which particles cross a sphere of radius @xmath3 centred at the origin in the relative coordinate system .",
    "this is obtained by integrating the inward radial velocity over the sphere , and multiplying by the density @xmath33 .",
    "this approach gives an expression for the collision rate which we term @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the radial velocity at spherical coordinate @xmath47 , radius @xmath18 and time @xmath48 .",
    "the function @xmath49 is a heaviside step function , which is used to select regions of the surface where the flow is into the sphere of radius @xmath3 .",
    "this is the fundamental expression for the collision rate given by saffman & turner @xcite . in section [ sec",
    ": 3.2 ] we discuss why this expression is not exact , and give the precise formula .",
    "the remainder of this section considers how this expression is evaluated ; some new results are presented in the appendix .",
    "the evaluation of ( [ eq : 3.1 ] ) is greatly simplified in the case where the particles are small , in the sense that @xmath50 . in this case",
    "the relative velocity is accurately approximated using the velocity gradient of the random velocity field @xmath51 .",
    "this approximation was also considered by saffman & turner @xcite .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath52 , the relative velocity @xmath53 is approximated as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the rate of strain matrix of the flow @xmath56 , with elements @xmath57 ( and @xmath58 ) .",
    "two particles with radii @xmath59 moving close to each other will thus experience a relative velocity @xmath60 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : 1 ] for a flow which is hyperbolic in the vicinity of the reference particle .",
    "the corresponding relative radial speed @xmath61 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the radial unit vector . in particular , at the distance @xmath64 where particles collide , the radial speed is @xmath65 .",
    "thus when @xmath50 , equation ( [ eq : 3.1 ] ) reduces to @xmath66 this expression was also obtained in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this subsection is concerned with the evaluation of ( [ eq : 3.2 ] ) .",
    "schematic picture of two particles of radius @xmath0 passing each other in a hyperbolic flow .",
    "the particle at the origin will see particles move past on hyperbolic trajectories .",
    "collisions occur whenever particles approach closer than @xmath3 .",
    "the collision rate is thus determined by the influx of particles into a disc of radius @xmath3 ( dashed line ) around the origin.,width=226 ]    earlier , smoluchowski @xcite had considered the special case of a fluid flowing with a uniform shear in @xmath67 dimensions : @xmath68 he obtained the collision rate : @xmath69 which is in agreement with the result of evaluating ( [ eq : 3.2 ] ) for this case . for a general strain - rate matrix @xmath70 the evaluation of ( [ eq : 3.2 ] ) is , however , very difficult . in [ sec : appa ]",
    "we discuss how this expression is evaluated for a general matrix @xmath71 in two dimensions , and for a general traceless matrix ( representing an incompressible flow ) in three dimensions .    in a turbulent flow , saffman &",
    "turner @xcite argued that the elements of @xmath71 change as a function of position and one needs to average over the ensemble of strain matrices @xmath70 at different positions in order to estimate the collision rate , so that ( [ eq : 3.2 ] ) is replaced by : @xmath72 at first sight the requirement to average over @xmath71 appears to complicate the problem .",
    "however , for a rotationally invariant ensemble of random flows , the problem is considerably simplified by taking the average . in an incompressible flow , for each realisation of @xmath1 , the currents into and out of the collision region ( the disk or sphere of radius @xmath3 ) cancel precisely . therefore ( [ eq : 3.5 ] ) can be written as @xmath73 ) or ( [ eq : 2.4 ] ) , with @xmath74 .",
    "this is demonstrated by the following argument ( here we discuss the two - dimensional case ) .",
    "if we did not include the factor @xmath75 in ( [ eq : 3.6 ] ) , we would calculate the sum of the collision rate for the flow @xmath51 and for the time - reversed flow @xmath76 .",
    "the time reversed flow is generated by reversing the signs of the potentials @xmath9 and @xmath8 in ( [ eq : 2.2 ] ) .",
    "the probability density for the gaussian field @xmath77 is the same as for @xmath9 ( and similarly for @xmath8 ) .",
    "it follows that the collision rate for the time - reversed flow @xmath76 is the same as for @xmath51 .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : 3.6 ] ) is therefore also valid for the cases of compressible flow which we consider in this paper .    now using rotational symmetry",
    ", one finds the very simple expression @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the the area of the sphere of radius @xmath3 in @xmath34 dimensions ( explicitly @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) . for the gaussian model flow which we consider , equation ( [ eq : 3.7 ] ) gives @xmath82 with @xmath83      the saffman - turner expression for the collision rate , equation ( [ eq : 3.1 ] ) or ( [ eq : 3.7 ] ) , correctly describes the initial collision rate .",
    "there are , however , two reasons why the collision rate may approach a significantly different value after an initial transient .    the first reason why ( [ eq : 3.1 ] ) may fail arises from the fact that the flow field fluctuates in time . recall that we are concerned with the rate at which pairs of particles collide for the first time",
    "if the flow is time - dependent , the relative position coordinate @xmath84 may pass through the sphere of radius @xmath3 more than once .",
    "this effect may be accounted for by writing the collision rate in the form @xmath85 as before @xmath86 is the @xmath34-dimensional surface element at @xmath64 and @xmath61 is the radial velocity component ( the relative speed ) and the heaviside step function ensures that only particles entering the sphere contribute to the collision rate .",
    "the factor @xmath87 is the density of particles in the neighbourhood of the test particle at time @xmath48 .",
    "the function @xmath88 is an indicator function : it is equal to unity if the point reaching the surface element @xmath47 at radius @xmath3 and at time @xmath48 has not previously passed through the sphere of radius @xmath3 , otherwise it is zero .",
    "the effect of including the function @xmath88 is illustrated in figure [ fig : 2 ] .",
    "the collision rate will reduce below the saffman - turner estimate for times where @xmath88 is no longer unity ..     initial positions of particles which have collided with a reference particle at the origin after a certain time ( shaded regions ) .",
    "the collision region ( disk of radius @xmath3 ) is bounded by a dashed circle . at short times",
    "this region extends along the direction of the stable eigenvector of the initial flow . at intermediate times",
    ", we see the effect of this eigenvector having rotated . at long times , the set of colliding initial conditions is stretched and folded .",
    "the shaded region then covers most of the surface of the circle , including the region where the radial velocity is inward .",
    "the figure shows results of a simulated flow with small kubo number , of the type discussed in section [ sec : 4 ] , at times @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    ", width=566 ]    in the general case ( [ eq : 3.13 ] ) is difficult to evaluate since the indicator function @xmath88 depends on the history of the flow .",
    "if the flow is rapidly fluctuating ( that is , if the kubo number of the flow is small ) , the relative separation of two particles undergoes a diffusion process which makes it possible to exactly evaluate the collision rate for a given ensemble of random flows .",
    "a second effect may modify the collision rate from the saffman - turner estimate is that if the flow field is compressible , particles may cluster together , and the particle density in the vicinity of a test particle may be higher than the average density .",
    "this effect is expected to cause the collision rate to increase , after an initial transient during which the clustering becomes established .",
    "again , this effect is very hard to quantify in the general case , but we can obtain precise asymptotic results in the limit of small kubo number , where a diffusion approximation becomes applicable . because we consider particles which are advected by the flow , there is no clustering effect when the flow is incompressible .",
    "we note that for incompressible flow the only correction to the saffman - turner estimate is the occurrence of the factor @xmath88 in ( [ eq : 3.13 ] ) .",
    "this implies that for advected particles in an incompressible flow , the saffman - turner estimate of the collision rate is an upper bound .",
    "in the limit of a rapidly changing flow , that is when @xmath92 , particle separations @xmath93 undergo a diffusion process ( see @xcite for a review ) . by solving the corresponding fokker - planck equation with the appropriate boundary conditions , we can determine the collision rate exactly in this limit .",
    "consider two particles , one at @xmath94 and the other in its vicinity , at @xmath95 .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eq : 2.1 ] ) implies that their separation @xmath96 obeys @xmath97 integrating ( [ eq : 4.1 ] ) over a short time interval @xmath98 we obtain @xmath99 the moments of the components @xmath100 of @xmath101 are : @xmath102 assuming that @xmath103 .",

    "the collision rate @xmath111 between particles of radius @xmath0 is given by the rate at which the particle separation @xmath18 decreases below @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this rate equals the radial probability current of particle separations evaluated at @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the radial unit vector .",
    "we evaluate ( [ eq : 4.8 ] ) in two steps .",
    "first ( in section [ sec : 5 ] ) we determine the steady - state collision rate as @xmath114 .",
    "second , we determine the full time - dependence of the collision rate ( section [ sec : 6 ] ) , describing how the initial transient discussed in section [ sec : 3 ] approaches the steady state .      because of the angular symmetry of the statistics of the fluid velocity , it is convenient to transform ( [ eq : 4.4 ] ) to spherical coordinates .",

    "the equation of motion ( [ eq : 2.1 ] ) is only physically meaningful when @xmath59 , so that the fluid velocity is approximately the same throughout all of the region occupied by the particle .",
    "we will , however , solve the diffusion equation for general @xmath0 .",
    "one reason for treating the general case is that it is hard to verify the analytical expressions for the limiting case @xmath125 in numerical investigations .    to determine this current , it is necessary to consider the appropriate boundary conditions",
    "first , if the particle distribution initially is uniform with density @xmath33 , we expect it to remain so at large separations .",
