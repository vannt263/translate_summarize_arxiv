    "failure avoidance is of paramount importance in critical software systems , needed to be considered in the first place as it has a direct impact on the safe operation .",
    "the main reasons for system failure are described in @xcite . around 44% of the failures",
    "are caused by wrong system specifications , and a 15% are introduced during the design and development phases .",
    "this means that over 60% of the failures can be avoided during design and development phases .",
    "some of the most common errors are to start the verification process in the final phase of the project or not to take into account the safety from the beginning .",
    "on the other hand , the cost associated to certain bugs and reingeneering can be unacceptably high .",
    "in general , the cost of the development activities is directly related to the required safety level .",
    "although this cost tends to be restrained , it can be doubled if the development follows an approach that does not consider safety requirements .",
    "there are a number of regulations and norms such as do-178b@xcite and do-278@xcite that define the set of _ objectives _ to achieve an acceptable level of safety . in the scope of critical software projects , there is a process of continuous investigation in order to reduce costs and development time , that usually includes the definition of methodologies and process automation and/or optimization techniques .",
    "the usage of adequate tools that support them is essential in order to optimize the monitoring of the processes . using a _",
    "v- model _ , the processes or phases identified in do-178b@xcite and do-278@xcite are _ planning _ , _ requirements _ , _ design _ , _ coding and integration _ , _ integration _ , _ verification _ , _ configuration management _ , _ quality assurance _ and _ certification / approval liaison_. some of these phases are _ integral processes _ and must be performed through all the software life cycle .    due to the specific requirements of the safety monitoring processes ,",
    "it is usual that the status information for all the involved processes is very complex ; information is typically contained in different places , and it is responsibility of several teams . this situation makes the status monitoring to be a difficult task to perform , prone to causing several undesirable effects such as missing information , or bad dimensioning of the development situation . in critical systems developments",
    ", this may lead to unsafe situations that have to be avoided .",
    "current monitoring tools are , in practice , complex tool chains mostly supporting separate activity monitoring .",
    "usually , the different views over the development progress are provided by distinct tools in a non collaborative environment .",
    "since different critical software projects follow different norms , there are no tools that are able to be easily customized to adapt to different norms .",
    "for instance , embedded software installed in aircrafts ( like cockpits , mission computers and others ) is usually developed under do-178b@xcite while ground equipments ( like navigation or surveillance radars ) use do-278@xcite . in both cases ,",
    "most of the processes are similar , but they are in fact different among themselves .",
    "for example , do-278@xcite introduces considerations about cots software or adaptation data .",
    "therefore , it is needed to take into account the particular characteristics of each norm , additional requirements introduced in each project , and possible changes in the applicable norm .    to increase the efficiency of development in critical software systems ,",
    "it is required that norms are supported by flexible yet pragmatic and more powerful monitoring methodologies that can be flexible to adjust to different norms .",
    "a severe drawback of current methods and tools is that they do not fully support the definition and use of a consistent and uniform methodology for the monitoring of the verification activities for all projects , and they do not facilitate the compliance with regulatory requirements .",
    "this paper describes an approach to improve the current practices of monitoring by providing a new methodology that covers the verification management activities in a collaborative environment to facilitate the integration with other life cycle process , and provide the possibility of future extensions .",
    "we present an approach that automates the process of monitoring by the integration of optimization mechanisms that includes all the information regarding the compliance statement of the applicable norm .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : intro ] presents an introduction and motivation for this work .",
    "section [ sec : background ] describes the related work in what concerns norms and practices used for monitoring .",
    "section [ sec : avapproach ] describes the proposed approach that allows cross - norm monitoring of the verification .",
    "section [ sec : validation ] presents the implementation of the methodology in a tool and its usage and results for a real - world critical software project .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "there are several standards that define processes for the software development of critical systems .",
    "most of these standards were initially guidelines describing an approach to the regulatory requirements ; they have later become de facto regulations due to their widespread adoption . some of these standards are defined in table [ standards ] .",
    ".selected related standards [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     once the project information was specified and parametrized according to table [ tab : parameterization_example ] , the monitoring process began where all actors used the supporting tool for the monitoring of all verification activities . checklists for each _ configuration item _ were filled , showing their status and details .",
    "_ observations _ about each item were registered in the tool .",
    "results are shown in figure [ fig : no_conformities_found_by_process ] where different metrics about the _ non - conformities _ are found , separated by verification process .",
    "there were @xmath0 observations introduced regarding the plans and standards developed for the project ; @xmath1 non - conformities were registered about the requirements , and @xmath2 regarding the design ; @xmath3 non - conformities were registered in the coding and integration processes , related to the compliance with the coding standard .",
    "@xmath4 incidences were found during the execution of the tests , and were registered in the supporting tool for monitoring and representing the status of the integration . eventually , @xmath5 non - conformities were detected in the _ verification of verification processes_. changes needed to the procedures where detected during the life cycle , and introduced in the tool , as part of the verification of verification process .",
    "the main _ observations _ were focused on the need of including additional clarifications about some contents , like references to the development and verification tools , and the need of their qualification .",
    "other comments refereed to the need of including additional information , or clarify the specified organization . in some cases , changes were needed such as in the _ software configuration management plan _ to address some processes required by the internal company policies .",
    "the observations of the _ certification authority _ were also introduced , becoming part of the information about the development process .    regarding the development standards ( requirements , design , and coding ) ,",
    "there were not many observations given that standards are typically well known and applied in different projects .",
    "still additional comments were brought due to the particularities of each project and improvements to be introduced .    for the requirements and design processes , the requirements document was introduced , filling the correspondent checklists and registering the observations .",
    "the requirements document is one of the most important one as requirements are used as the basis for ( 1 ) the design as they describe the required functionality ; and ( 2 ) to define the tests to be performed in the corresponding phase .",
    "consequently , there were more than @xmath6 of observations that involved changes in the original document , including some clarifications introduced by the author .",
    "in the review of this document , the applicable standard ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the requirements standard defined for the project were used .",
    "the tool provided tangible evidences for the results of the verification process for each development process which serves as a basic reference for generate the _ software accomplishment summary _ and _ system safety assessment_. in these documents , it is necessary to include references to all the evidences needed for the development assurance level required .",
    "the data introduced in the tool are able to provide an evidence to the certification authorities of the performed work and compliance status .",
    "the architecture of the software is of paramount importance in critical systems as it directly impacts the complexity of the final development and , therefore , its verification and testing .",
    "critical software systems verification focuses heavily on temporal behavior applying real - time mechanisms ( @xcite ) .",
    "other soft real - time domains rather provide quality of service mechanisms embedded in the software logic that accounds for mechanisms to allow dynamic execution whereas preserving timely properties ( @xcite ) .",
    "verification of the properties of distributed software also related to newer domains as cloud ( @xcite ) , the characteristics of the middleware are integrated in the model ( @xcite ) .",
    "lastly , specific verification mechanisms are executed on - line in very specific contexts such as cyber - physical systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of information and the complexity of the applicable norms and processes in systems with safety requirements increases costs and difficulties to achieve requirements compliance .",
    "this paper has presented an approach that clarifies these processes , that is supported by a tool that facilitates the compliance with the safety requirements and the adoption of new regulations .    due to the introduced information for",
    "the data items for each development phase , actors involved in the projects can know the software life cycle defined with a quick view of the tool .",
    "this directly implies a reduction in the training time of engineers . for each item",
    "it is possible to know the existing non conformities , which enables their early detection and correction by the responsible . in the tool",
    ", the collaboration is achieved through a web interface .",
    "all information about the status of development and verification tasks is immediately accessible to actors , that provides knowledge about the work performed and the pending tasks .",
    "so , an estimation of the remaining activities can be calculated , which could lead to implement corrective actions and minimize the impact in project goals , decreasing the project risks .",
    "the tool covers all the verification process according to the different levels .",
    "the supporting tool has managed two standards ( @xcite and @xcite ) , covering a large scope of safety related projects .",
    "a set of documents and checklists for each develop phase and for document have been created , providing a basic framework to manage this kind of projects .",
    "it is possible to add additional documents at any time .",
    "finally , the methodology allows to follow any kind of development model .",
    "thus , the objective about integration with other life cycle processes is fulfilled by the presented approach , including information about the development .",
    "the supporting tool provides possibilities of future growth , by extensions that include information about new norms or processes .",
