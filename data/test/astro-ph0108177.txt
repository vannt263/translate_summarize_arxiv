    "the cosmic reionization is an issue of great significance in cosmology in relation to the formation of galaxies .",
    "the information on the ionization states has been accumulated by the observations of ly@xmath0 absorption lines in high redshift qso or galaxy spectra .",
    "recently , 3d cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( cen et al . 1994 ; miralda - escude et al . 1996 ; gnedin & ostriker 1996 ; zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) have revealed that the ly@xmath0 absorption systems can be explained in terms of the absorption by intergalactic density fluctuations . also , the radiative transfer effects have been stressed by 3d calculations on the reionization of intergalactic matter ( abel , norman , & madau 1999 ; razoumov & scott 1999 ; gnedin 2000 ; nakamoto , umemura , & susa 2000 ; ciardi et al .",
    "2000 ) . here , to elucidate the reionization history ,",
    "we simulate qso absorption lines by using the results of 3d radiative transfer calculations and compare them to observations at high redshifts .",
    "also , the collapse of pregalactic clouds in a reionized universe is explored in relation to the formation of protogalaxies in uv background radiation .",
    "in a simulation box , random gaussian density fluctuations are generated based upon the zeldovich approximation in the context of cdm cosmology .",
    "the simulation box is irradiated by the isotropic uv background radiation of a power law - type spectrum , @xmath6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 hz@xmath8 sr@xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the lyman limit frequency .",
    "the ionization structure is obtained by solving the three - dimensional radiative transfer equation .",
    "the details of numerical techniques are presented in nakamoto , umemura , & susa ( 2000 ) ( see also the paper by nakamoto et al . in this volume ) .",
    "the resultant ionization degrees in the universe are different from place to place by more than three orders of magnitude . due to such inhomogeneous ionization structure",
    ", relatively low ionization regions could produce strong absorption in quasar spectra . to make a direct comparison with the observations , we simulate absorption lines .",
    "first , we focus on ly@xmath0 absorption . to match the recent observations by the keck telescope",
    ", we adopt the resolution of r=45000 and the variance of 0.04 , and assume the voigt profile of lines .",
    "the simulated ly@xmath0 absorption features are shown in upper three panels in figure 1 .    in order to compare the simulated absorption degree with observations ,",
    "we have assessed the so - called continuum depression , @xmath10 . in figure 1 , the simulated @xmath10 is compared to observations at high redshifts .",
    "we see that any model with a constant uv intensity does not match the observed trend that @xmath10 tends to grow quickly at redshifts higher than 4 .",
    "this implies that the metagalactic uv intensity must decrease rapidly with @xmath1 at @xmath2 by two orders of magnitude at least .",
    "the redshift dependence of uv background is required to be @xmath3 $ ] at @xmath2 .",
    "if the uv intensity decreases in this fashion , the reionization epoch is estimated to be @xmath11 .",
    "if the intensity keeps a level of @xmath12 at @xmath13 , the reionization epoch is assessed to be @xmath14 .",
    "thus , it is concluded that the cosmic reionization must have taken place between @xmath4 and 10 .",
    "however , the ly@xmath0 absorption is not appropriate to determine the reionization epoch more accurately , because , as seen in the absorption features in figure 1 , ly@xmath0 is too strongly depleted even if the mean neutral fraction is less than @xmath15 . in other words , @xmath10 is no longer sensitive to @xmath16 around the cosmic reionization epoch .",
    "as shown in the previous subsection , ly@xmath0 has too high line opacity to probe the universe at @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , three conditions are required for a line in order to investigate the universe at @xmath13 : ( 1 ) it has lower line opacity than ly@xmath0 , ( 2 ) line emission is detectable , and ( 3 ) it has lower extinction against dust because young star - forming galaxies are often dust - enshrouded .",
    "the most favorable solution seems to be h@xmath0 absorption lines .",
    "the h@xmath0 absorption is likely to be relatively weak around @xmath17 , while it could be sensitive to the ionization degrees at @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , h@xmath0 forest can be a more powerful tool to probe the universe at @xmath13 .",
    "forest has been never detected so far .",
    "the reason comes from the fact that h@xmath0 has much weaker opacity than ly@xmath0 . from observational points of view",
    ", the h@xmath0 continuum depression can be detected by low - dispersion spectroscopy or narrow - band photometry .",
    "furthermore , h@xmath0 forest is subject to less uv bump effects for agns compared to ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "the wavelengths of h@xmath0",
    "forest drop on @xmath18 at @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the observations can be done with subaru ircs , iris , sirtf , ngst , or h2/l2 .",
    "if one can obtain the absorption features with the resolution greater than 10000 , one can recover the density fluctuations at high redshifts .",
    "they allow us to determine the linear amplitude of pregalactic perturbations which is by no means measured in the cbr due to the strong sunyaev - zeldovich effects in galactic scales .",
    "if one has the amplitude of linear density fluctuations at galactic scales , one can not only set the initial condition for galaxy formation , but also make more reliable determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "here , the cosmology is assumed to have @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 with usual meanings .",
    "susa & umemura ( 2000a ) have explored the sheet collapse of a pregalactic cloud under uv background radiation , with including h@xmath24 chemistry .",
    "they have found that the cloud evolution is specified by two initial parameters , i.e. , the mean density ( @xmath25 ) and the thickness ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the initial parameter dependence is translated into the baryonic mass [ @xmath27 and the collapse epoch ( @xmath28 ) by assuming the initial stage is close to the maximum expansion of a density fluctuation .",
    "the numerical results have shown that the cloud evolution bifurcates into two characteristic states , i.e. , ( a ) a pregalactic cloud is self - shielded against the external uv in the course of the sheet collapse , so that the cloud cools down below @xmath29k due to h@xmath24 cooling and undergoes efficient star formation .",
    "hence , it is expected to evolve into an early type galaxy with a high bulge - to - disk ratio ( b / d ) due to the dissipationless virialization , or ( b ) a cloud is not self - shielded during the sheet collapse , but is self - shielded through the shrink to the rotation barrier .",
    "this leads to the retarded star formation , and thus the virialization would proceed in a fairly dissipative fashion . as a result , a late type ( small b / d ) galaxy would be preferentially born .",
    "such bifurcation is specified solely by a mass scale as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the collapse epoch and @xmath32 is the uv background intensity in units of @xmath33 .      here",
    "we include the effect of the evolution of uv background radiation .",
    "we assume @xmath34 ^ 3 $ ] for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "this dependence is consistent with the uv intensity in the present epoch ( maloney 1993 ; dove & shull 1994 ) , and the value inferred from the qso proximity effects at intermediate redshifts ( bajtlik , duncan , & ostriker 1988 ; giallongo et al .",
    "1996 ) . as for @xmath38",
    ", two models are employed .",
    "the first one is ( a ) the exponentially damping model , @xmath39 $ ] , which is inferred by the continuum depression , and the second one is ( b ) the constant extrapolation model , @xmath40 .",
    "then , based upon the above paradigm of the galaxy formation under uv background , the evolutionary bifurcation of pregalactic clouds is confronted with observations of elliptical and spiral galaxies . using the observed properties of galaxies ,",
    "the collapse epochs are assessed for each type of galaxies with attentive mass estimation ( susa & umemura 2000b ) .",
    "the comparison of observed galaxies with the bifurcation theory is presented in figure 2 .",
    "small open circles represent spiral galaxies in persic & salucci ( 1995 ) .",
    "small filled triangles denote the e and e - s0 galaxies in faber et al .",
    "open stars are elliptical galaxies from x - ray observations in matsumoto et al .",
    "the thick solid and dashed lines represent the bifurcation mass @xmath41 , respectively for model a and b , where both are identical at @xmath42 . by this direct comparison of the theory with the observations",
    ", it turns out that the theoretical bifurcation branch successfully discriminates between elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the uv background radiation could play a profound role for the differentiation of the galactic morphology into the hubble sequence . in figure 2 ,",
    "the density fluctuations in the cdm cosmology are also plotted by three thin solid lines marked as @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the variance of cdm perturbations .",
    "we find that the bifurcation mass scale coincides with the @xmath47 density fluctuations .",
    "thus , the present results are also intriguing from a view point of the density morphology relation of galaxies , because higher @xmath46 peaks reside preferentially in denser regions rather than in low - dense regions .",
    "using the ionization structure in an inhomogeneous universe obtained by 3d radiative transfer calculations on the reionization , we have simulated qso absorption lines at high redshifts . by comparison of simulated ly@xmath0 continuum depression with recent observations",
    ", it has been found that the metagalactic uv intensity must decrease rapidly with @xmath1 at @xmath2 , and the reionization must have taken place between @xmath4 and 10 .",
    "based on this time - dependence of uv background intensity , we have explored the collapse of pregalactic clouds in the uv background , and found that the degree of self - shielding bifurcates the evolution of protogalaxies .",
    "the bifurcation is characterized by a mass scale dependent on uv background intensity and redshift . by confrontation with observations",
    "it has turned out that the bifurcation mass successfully discriminates between elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the uv background radiation is closely related to the final bulge - to - disk ratios of galaxies .",
    "we have assumed here agn - like ionizing sources , but which type of sources reionized the universe is still an issue under a lot of debate .",
    "anyhow , the present analysis suggests that to elucidate precisely the reionization history is extraordinarily important for the understanding of galaxy formation .",
