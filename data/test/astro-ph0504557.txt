    "one phenomenon to emerge from @xmath6-body simulations of increasingly higher resolution is the existence of substructure ( or subhalos ) in dark matter halos ( e.g. , tormen et al . 1998 ; klypin et al .",
    "1999b ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ; ghigna et al .",
    "these small subhalos , relics of hierarchical structure formation , have accreted onto larger host halos and survived tidal forces . depending on their mass , density structure , orbit , and accretion time",
    ", the subhalos with high central densities can avoid complete tidal destruction although many lose a large fraction of their initial mass .",
    "these small and dense dark matter substructures , however , are prone to numerical artifacts and can be disrupted due to insufficient force and mass resolution . disentangling these numerical effects from the actual subhalo dynamics",
    "is an essential step towards understanding the composition and formation of structure .",
    "quantifying the effects due to dark matter substructure is also important for interpreting weak lensing surveys , which are sensitive to the clustering statistics of the overall density field . the level of precision for which surveys such as snap are striving ( massey et al .",
    "2004 ) suggests that theoretical predictions for the weak lensing convergence power spectrum need to be accurate to within a few percent over a wide of range of scales ( e.g. huterer & takada 2005 ) . at this level",
    ", subhalos may contribute significantly to the nonlinear power spectrum because they typically constitute about 10% of the host mass .    in the sections to follow ,",
    "we examine the effects of substructure on the matter and weak lensing power spectra with two methods . in ",
    "2 we use the result of a high resolution @xmath6-body simulation and quantify the changes in the power spectra when we smooth out increasing amounts of substructures .",
    "our other approach , detailed in   3 , is to incorporate substructure into the analytic halo model .",
    "the results are dependent on the parameters used in the model , but they provide useful physical insight into the results from @xmath6-body simulations .",
    "we summarize and discuss the results in   4 .",
    "we use the outputs of a cosmological dark - matter - only simulation that contains a significant amount of substructure .",
    "this simulation is a concordance , flat @xmath7cdm model : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the box size is @xmath10 mpc , the number of particles is @xmath11 , and the particle mass is @xmath12 .",
    "the simulation uses the adaptive refinement tree @xmath6-body code ( art ; kravtsov et al .",
    "1997 ; kravtsov 1999 ) to achieve high force resolution in dense regions . in this particular",
    "run the volume is initially resolved with a @xmath13 grid , and the smallest grid cell found at the end of the simulation is @xmath14 kpc .",
    "the actual resolution is about twice this value ( kravtsov et al .",
    "more details about the simulation can be found in tasitsiomi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    to quantify the effects of subhalos on the matter and weak lensing power spectra",
    ", we first identify the simulation particles that comprise subhalos within each halo .",
    "this is achieved using a version of the bound density maxima algorithm ( klypin et al .",
    "1999a ) , which identifies all local density peaks and therefore finds both halos and subhalos .",
    "it identifies the particles that make up each of the peaks and removes those not bound to the corresponding halo . as a controlled experiment",
    ", we then smooth out the subhalos within the virial radius of each host halo by redistributing these subhalo particles back in the smooth component of the host halo according to a spherically - symmetric nfw profile ( navarro , frenk , & white 1996 ) . for the concentration parameter @xmath15 of the profile",
    ", we do not use the fitting formulae ( e.g. , bullock et al .",
    "2001 ; dolag et al .",
    "2004 ) but instead fit each host halo individually to take into account the significant halo - to - halo scatter in @xmath15 .",
    "we therefore smooth over the subhalos and increase the normalization but not the shape of the spherically averaged profile of the smooth component to accommodate the mass from the subhalo component .",
    "this smoothing procedure also serves as a simple model for the effects of resolution on the abundance of subhalos in simulations , in which the lack of sufficient resolution will cause an incoming small halo to be disrupted quickly and lose most of its particles over its short - lived orbit .",
    "we quantify this effect by experimenting with different cut - offs on the subhalo mass : subhalos with masses below the cut - off are removed and have their particles spread over the host halo ; subhalos with masses above the cut - off are left alone . increasing mass cut - offs",
    "should roughly mimic increasingly lower resolution simulations because only higher mass subhalos will stay intact in the halo environment .",
    "we then calculate the matter fluctuation power spectrum @xmath16 , the fourier transform of the 2-point correlation function , and the matter bispectrum @xmath17 , the fourier transform of the 3-point correlation function . in order to compute @xmath18 and @xmath19 at large @xmath20 without using an enormous amount of memory ,",
    "we subdivide the simulation cube into smaller cubes and stack these on top of each other ( called `` chaining the power '' in smith et al .",
    "a typical stacking level used is 8 , meaning that we subdivide the box into @xmath21 cubes and stack these .",
    "we use stacked spectra for the high-@xmath20 regime and unstacked spectra for low-@xmath20 . finally , we subtract shot noise ( @xmath22 ) from the outputted spectra to eliminate discreteness effects .",
    "[ fig : pk ] shows the effects of substructure on the _ dimensionless _ power spectrum @xmath23 and the equilateral bispectrum @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "plotted is the ratio of the spectrum from the raw art output divided by the spectrum from the altered data .",
    "the altered data have no subhalos with masses below the labeled mass cutoff .",
    "the mass in the removed subhalos has been redistributed smoothly into the host halo as described above .",
    "the deviation from the original spectrum becomes larger as the cutoff is increased because more subhalos have been smoothed out . for a given cutoff , the figure shows that a simulation with dark matter substructures ( such as the raw art output ) has @xmath26 power at @xmath27 _ h _ mpc@xmath2 and _ less _ power at @xmath28 mpc@xmath2 than a simulation with smoother halos .",
    "we believe these opposite behaviors reflect the two competing factors present in our numerical experiments : _ removal _ of mass within subhalos , which affects scales comparable to or below subhalo radii ( and hence @xmath3 mpc@xmath2 ) , and _ addition _ of this mass back into the smooth component of the halo , which affects the larger scales of @xmath29 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the ratio approaches unity for @xmath30 mpc@xmath2 simply because the mass distribution on scales above individual host halos is unaltered .",
    "we will examine these effects further in the context of the halo model in ",
    "3 .    for a given curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] , we have also calculated the contributions from subhalos in host halos of varying masses to quantify the relative importance of cluster versus galactic host halos . for the @xmath31 curve ,",
    "e.g. , we find that smoothing over the subhalos in host halos above @xmath32 and @xmath33 account for 5% and 10% in the total 12% dip seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] , respectively . for the @xmath34 cutoff ,",
    "the numbers are 2% and 5% of the total 6% dip .",
    "the halos found in @xmath6-body simulations are generally triaxial .",
    "when we redistribute the subhalo particles , however , we assume for simplicity a spherical distribution .",
    "this assumption makes the altered halos slightly rounder .",
    "one can estimate how this effect changes the power spectrum by using the halo model without substructure .",
    "smith & watts ( 2005 ) incorporated a distribution of halo shapes found by jing & suto ( 2002 ) from cosmological simulations into the halo model ( ignoring the substructure contribution ) . compared with the case where all the halos are spherical ,",
    "they observed a peak decrement in the power spectrum of about @xmath35 for @xmath36 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding effect in our calculations would be much smaller since we redistribute only the subset of particles that belong to subhalos into the rounder shape ( e.g. , about 10% of all particles in the case where the cutoff was @xmath37 ) .",
    "thus , by extending the results of smith & watts , we expect the spurious rounder halos in our study to account for less than @xmath38 of the total @xmath39 drop .",
    "[ fig : weak ] shows the weak lensing convergence power spectrum @xmath40 corresponding to the matter power spectrum @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] .",
    "it is calculated from @xmath41 using limber s approximation and assumption of a flat universe : @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the comoving radial distance , and the weak lensing weight is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the distribution of source galaxies such that @xmath46 ( see , e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) . here",
    "we assume for simplicity that all sources are at one redshift ( @xmath47 ) and use the @xmath48 simulation output to estimate @xmath41 .",
    "host halos at higher redshift may have a larger fraction of their mass in substructures because the typical subhalo accretion epoch would be more recent and there would be less time for tidal disruption .",
    "the effects of @xmath49 substructure may therefore be somewhat larger than shown here for @xmath48 , although we do not expect the change to be significant .    the gray band in fig .",
    "[ fig : weak ] marks the extent of uncertainties from sample variance and shape noise in weak lensing measurements assuming _ gaussian _ density fields ( kaiser 1998 ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the fraction of the sky surveyed , @xmath52 is the rms ellipticity of galaxies , and @xmath53 is the number density of galaxies on the sky .",
    "the error is dominated by the sample variance on large scales ( first term in eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : noise ] ] ) and the `` shape noise '' on small scales .",
    "our assumption of gaussianity is not applicable for the angular scales shown in the plot because the scales plotted are near or below the size of individual halos , but the errors shown should be a useful reference and have been used in previous studies .",
    "a reliable estimate of the error would presumably require a ray tracing calculation which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "to gain a deeper understanding of the simulation results in figs .",
    "[ fig : pk ] and [ fig : weak ] , we use the semi - analytic halo model to build up the nonlinear power spectrum from different kinds of pairs of mass elements that may occur in halos ( e.g. ma & fry 2000 ; peacock & smith 2000 ; seljak 2000 ; scoccimarro et al 2001 ) .",
    "the original halo model assumes that all mass resides in virialized , spherical halos without substructures .",
    "one can then build the matter power spectrum from the different kinds of pairs of particles that contribute to the 2-point clustering statistics by writing @xmath54 , where the 1-halo term @xmath55 contains contributions from particle pairs where both particles reside in the same halo , and the 2-halo term @xmath56 is from pairs where the two particles reside in different halos .",
    "the 1-halo term is a mass - weighted average of single halo profiles and dominates on the scales of interest ( @xmath57 mpc@xmath2 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] because close pairs of particles are more likely to be found in the same halo .",
    "the 2-halo term is closely related to the linear power spectrum and is important only at large separation ( i.e. small @xmath20 ) where a pair of particles is more likely to be found in two distinct halos .",
    "similarly , the bispectrum can be constructed from the different classes of triplets of particles ( see , e.g. , ma & fry 2000 ) .",
    "the original halo model can be readily extended to take into account a clumpy subhalo component in an otherwise smooth host halo .",
    "sheth & jain ( 2003 ) , e.g. , decompose the original 1-halo term into @xmath58 , where `` s '' denotes smooth and `` c '' denotes clump .",
    "the smooth - smooth term , @xmath59 , arises from pairs of particles that both belong to the smooth component of the same host halo .",
    "this term is identical to the original 1-halo term except for an overall decrease in amplitude by the factor @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the fraction of the total halo mass that resides in subhalos .",
    "the smooth - clump term , @xmath62 , is due to having one particle in a subhalo ( clump ) and the other in the host halo ( smooth ) .",
    "the 1- and 2-clump terms , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , come from having both particles in the same subhalo and in two different subhalos , respectively .",
    "explicitly , @xmath65",
    "^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are the fourier transforms of the host halo radial density profile , the subhalo radial density profile , and the radial distribution of subhalo centers , respectively .",
    "@xmath69 gives the number density of host halos with mass @xmath70 , and @xmath71 gives the number density of subhalos of mass @xmath72 inside a host halo of mass @xmath70 .",
    "a similar expression can be written down for the 2-halo term @xmath56 , which is also included in our calculations .",
    "[ fig : terms ] illustrates the contributions from the individual terms in the halo model .",
    "we use the nfw profile ( truncated at the virial radius ) for the input host halo @xmath66 and subhalo @xmath67 , and the concentration @xmath73 with @xmath74 that we find to approximate the art host halos and is identical to dolag et al ( 2004 ) except for a 15% increase in amplitude .",
    "we use @xmath75 for the subhalos to take into account tidal stripping but also compare different values in fig .  4 below .",
    "for the distribution of subhalo centers , @xmath76 , we compare the profile of nfw with that of gao et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who find the number of subhalos within a host halo s virial radius @xmath77 to be @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the total number of subhalos in the host .",
    "since this distribution at small @xmath81 is shallower ( @xmath82 ) than the inner part of the nfw profile ( @xmath83 ) , its fourier transform @xmath76 at high @xmath20 is about a factor of @xmath84 lower than that of the nfw profile .",
    "this decrement results in a much lower @xmath85 and @xmath86 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : terms ] ( dashed vs dotted curves ) .",
    "we find the subhalo centers in the art simulation to follow approximately the distribution of gao et al .",
    "although there is a large scatter .",
    "we use the mass function of sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) for the host halos @xmath87 and a power law @xmath88 that well approximates the subhalo mass function in the art simulation .",
    "the latter is normalized so that the total mass of subhalos in a host halo adds up to @xmath61 times the host mass @xmath70 ( @xmath89 in fig .",
    "3 ) . to compare the halo model with simulations , we set the lower limit on the @xmath59 integral to @xmath90 , which is the smallest halo present in the simulation ( about ten times the simulation particle mass )",
    ". the lower limit on the outer integrals of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 corresponds to the smallest halo that contains substructure , which we set to the smallest halo that we considered for erasing substructure in   2 : @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , the lower limit on the inner integrals of these terms is set to the smallest subhalo that can be resolved ( i.e. @xmath92 ) .",
    "4 compares the sum of all the terms in the halo model with the simulation result from fig .  1 . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] , we illustrate the effects due to substructures by dividing out the power spectrum from the original ( smooth ) halo model , i.e. , @xmath93 $ ] , where @xmath59 is given before in eq .",
    "( [ haloterms ] ) .",
    "[ fig : halomod ] shows that the halo model is able to reproduce qualitatively the simulation results when the subhalo centers in the halo model are assigned the shallower distribution of gao et al .",
    "the feature of @xmath94 at @xmath95 mpc@xmath2 is mainly caused by the drop in the smooth - clump term relative to the smooth - smooth term at @xmath96 mpc@xmath2 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : terms ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath97 becomes @xmath98 only at @xmath99 mpc@xmath2 when the 1-clump term finally takes over .",
    "fitting the halo model to actual simulation results is clearly not exact in part due to the large scatters in the properties of simulated halos , e.g. , the concentration ( for both hosts and subhalos ) , the subhalo mass fraction @xmath61 , and the maximum subhalo mass in each host halo .",
    "the halo model allows us to study the dependence of clustering statistics on these parameters ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "in addition , a number of effects are neglected in the current halo model , e.g. , tidal effects are likely to reduce the number of subhalos ( modeled by @xmath100 of gao et al . here ) as well as their outer radii ( not modeled here ) towards host halo centers ; a larger amount of stripped subhalo mass may also be deposited to the inner parts of the hosts , resulting in a radius - dependent subhalo mass fraction @xmath61 within the host .",
    "4 also shows that the halo model predicts the opposite effect due to substructure ( i.e. @xmath101 at all @xmath20 ) if the subhalo centers @xmath76 are assumed to follow the nfw distribution like the underlying dark matter .",
    "the sign of this effect is consistent with the previous subhalo model study of dolney et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which assumed the same nfw profile for the subhalo centers and the hosts and obtained a matter power spectrum that had a _",
    "amplitude for all @xmath20 when the substructure terms were included .",
    "their results differ slightly from ours because of different integration limits .",
    "subhalos in recent simulations like that of gao et al .",
    ", however , show a much shallower radial distribution in the central regions of the host halos , and inclusion of gas dynamics appears to have little effect on the survivability of subhalos ( nagai & kravtsov 2005 ) .",
    "the shallow distribution is apparently due to tidal disruptions , even though the precise shape of the distribution is still a matter of debate ( e.g. , zentner et al .",
    "we have also experimented with a third distribution @xmath76 that has the nfw form but is less concentrated .",
    "we are able to bring @xmath97 below unity only when the concentration is reduced by a factor of more than 2.5 , and only when this reduction factor is increased to @xmath102 would we get a comparable dip as the curves for art simulation and gao et al . in fig .",
    "[ fig : halomod ] .",
    "it is interesting to see if we can mimic the behavior of the art simulation _ without _ using subhalos in the halo model .",
    "we try replacing the one - halo term , @xmath55 , by one that is a simple superposition of a gao et al .",
    "profile and the usual nfw profile .",
    "this accounts for the fact that @xmath103 of the mass is in a smooth nfw profile and that @xmath104 is in subhalos , which follow a flatter profile .",
    "one would not expect the high-@xmath20 regime to agree as it is dominated by the subhalos ( the 1-clump term , specifically ) .",
    "the intermediate range , @xmath95 mpc@xmath2 , is dominated by the host halo itself , but we find no similarity in this range either .",
    "subhalos are therefore needed if the halo model is to recreate the art results .",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide a physical understanding of the effects of substructures on clustering statistics . by experimenting with dark matter substructures in a cosmological simulation with @xmath11 particles",
    ", we have shown that the power spectra of matter fluctuations and weak lensing shear can change by up to @xmath105% ( and up to @xmath106% in the bispectrum ) if a significant amount of substructures is not resolved in a simulation .",
    "when a larger mass fraction of the host halos is in the form of lumpy subhalos , we find the effect is to lower the amplitude of the matter and weak lensing power spectra at the observationally relevant ranges of @xmath107 to @xmath108 mpc@xmath2 and @xmath109 , and to raise the amplitude on smaller scales . a similar drop in power",
    "is also seen in our analytic halo - subhalo model when the subhalo centers @xmath100 within a host halo are distributed with a shallower radial profile than the underlying dark matter ( as expected due to tidal effects ) . a way to understand",
    "the drop involves looking at where the dense regions are .",
    "when @xmath100 has an nfw form the subhalos basically trace the smooth background .",
    "thus , there is never a decrease in power when the smooth - smooth and smooth - clump terms are added because dense regions are in nearly the same relative positions .",
    "when we use a shallower profile for @xmath100 , the subhalos are not as numerous in the denser inner regions of the background halo .",
    "this decrease in the overlap between dense clump regions and the dense inner regions causes the drop in power .",
    "we have quantified the effects of substructures on clustering statistics by erasing substructures in an @xmath0 simulation .",
    "an important related question is whether @xmath0 , single - mass resolution simulations such as the one used in our study has sufficient resolution to measure the power spectrum to the few - percent accuracy required by future surveys .",
    "note that at least hundreds of particles and force resolution of @xmath110 kiloparsec are required to ensure subhalo survival against tidal forces , placing stringent requirements on the dynamic range of simulations .",
    "multi - mass resolution simulations designed for subhalo studies , on the other hand , do not give reliable predictions for @xmath16 on quasi - linear scales due to compromised resolution outside highly clustered regions .",
    "the fact that the curves in figs .",
    "1 and 2 continue to change at the few - percent level each time the mass threshold is lowered by 0.5 dex from @xmath111 to @xmath112 suggests that subhalos of @xmath113 may still be affecting the power spectra at a comparable level and that @xmath114 would be required .",
    "we also find @xmath115% changes in @xmath16 at @xmath116 mpc@xmath2 in the halo model as the minimum subhalo mass in the integration limit of eq .",
    "( 3 ) is lowered to @xmath117 ( although the exact predictions are sensitive to the slope of the subhalo mass function , which is assumed to be @xmath118 here . )",
    "careful convergence studies with higher resolution aided by insight from this study and detailed semi - analytic models for halo substructure will likely be needed to determine @xmath6 .",
    "there are other challenges to predicting accurately the weak lensing signal on single halo scales .",
    "the effect of neutrino clustering could cause a rise in weak lensing convergence of @xmath119 at @xmath120 ( abazajian et al .",
    "two recent groups have investigated different aspects of baryon effects .",
    "white ( 2004 ) found that baryonic contraction and its subsequent impact on the dark matter distribution is capable of causing an increase in the weak lensing convergence power of a few percent at @xmath121 .",
    "zhan & knox ( 2004 ) , on the other hand , use the fact that the hot intracluster medium does not follow the dark matter precisely and predict an opposite effect : a suppression of weak lensing power of a few percent at @xmath122 . unlike the effects of substructure and neutrino clustering , the baryon effects cause departures from the pure dark matter weak lensing signal that only get larger with increasing @xmath123 .",

    "<S> predicting the nonlinear power spectrum to a few percent accuracy for future surveys would therefore require large cosmological simulations that also have exquisite numerical resolution to model accurately the survivals of dark matter subhalos in the tidal fields of their hosts . </S>"
