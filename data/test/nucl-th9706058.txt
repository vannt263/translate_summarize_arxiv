    "in some models of ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions , the formation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is assumed to proceed via creation of a strong colour - electric field in the region between the two nuclei receding from each other after the collision , and the subsequent decay of the field by parton - pair production according to the well known nonperturbative formula given by schwinger @xcite .",
    "we shall call these models @xcite background - field models .",
    "they make use of the framework of the relativistic transport theory to study the formation and preequilibrium evolution of qgp , with schwinger s formula providing a basis for derivation of the source term ( i.e. , production rate in the one - particle phase space ) in the boltzmann transport equation .    in analogy with an ordinary parallel - plates capacitor ,",
    "the above models have also been called colour - plates models . the colour field ,",
    "however , need not owe its existence entirely to the colour plates .",
    "a high - density many - body system is often conveniently described in terms of a self - consistent mean field and residual short - range interactions .",
    "for example , blaizot and iancu @xcite have considered gauge theories at high temperatures and shown that long - wavelength excitations of qgp can be described as collective oscillations of gauge and fermionic mean fields .",
    "they have presented non - abelian solutions to the equations of motion , which correspond to spatially uniform colour oscillations .",
    "importance of the mean field has also been stressed in the context of hot and dense hadron gas models of relativistic heavy ion collisions ; see for example @xcite . whatever may be the origin of the colour field , once it is there , it can produce pairs of partons , add to the entropy of the system and affect its subsequent evolution .",
    "a few remarks on the source term mentioned above are in order . the exact one - loop nonperturbative result ( fig .",
    "1a ) that schwinger derived for pair production in a constant , uniform background electric field ( @xmath0 ) is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath3 is the particle mass .",
    "it is instructive to understand this result in terms of a semiclassical tunneling across the mass gap @xcite .",
    "this result , strictly speaking , is applicable to the parton pair production only in the so - called abelian approximation .",
    "secondly , eq . ( 1.1 ) gives the probability per unit volume and per unit time , that a pair is produced , while the transport equation requires the source term in _ one - particle phase space_. finally , and more importantly , unlike the case considered in @xcite where the constant electric field is maintained by external sources , the pairs produced in the background - field models derive their energy and momentum from the field , the field becomes time dependent and eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) stops being applicable .",
    "the resolution of these problems has so far involved rewriting the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) as an integral over @xmath4 or @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the parton momentum transverse to the direction of the collision axis .",
    "the expression so obtained has often been used in the qgp transport equation and it reads @xcite @xmath7 \\right\\vert.\\ ] ] while the above extension may be justified semiclassically , the next assumption that the constant @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( 1.2 ) , may be replaced by its time - dependent counterpart @xmath8 , merits a critical examination . strictly speaking ,",
    "this replacement is invalid since as soon as the field acquires time dependence , it can directly excite negative - energy particles to levels above the mass gap , by a perturbative mechanism , without recourse to any tunneling or barrier penetration mechanism .",
    "the above replacement may be justified as a kind of a local - field approximation provided the time - dependence of @xmath8 is so weak that it only excites frequencies with magnitudes negligible compared to the mass gap .",
    "equivalently , the field needs to be constant on the scale of the compton wavelength @xmath9 .",
    "fields that are constant over such large time intervals are unlikely to be produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "moreover , a justification for the local - field approximation , which could be looked for _ a posteriori _ is not forthcoming from the explicit numerical results presented in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to take the time dependence of the electric field into account , as properly as a semiclassical formalism would allow , and present a new source term based on fig .",
    "1b , for use in the qgp transport equation , thereby avoiding the unphysical aspect that we have pointed out in the current formulation .",
    "the mechanism depicted in fig .",
    "1b was used by martin et al .",
    "@xcite to calculate the total energy deposited during a certain time interval , under certain assumptions .",
    "they did not derive a source term .",
    "for fermion pair production in the presence of a _ space - time - dependent _ background field the amplitude to the lowest order ( fig .",

    "next , in order to evaluate @xmath15 , we introduce @xmath16 and use @xmath17 .",
    "this gives @xmath18 now recall @xmath19 to be able to compare our results with those based on eq .",

    "we shall now rewrite this term also in terms of @xmath25 . to that end , we choose the following gauge : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an arbitrary real function vanishing at @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita tensor in @xmath32 dimensions .",

    "we have @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the dual of @xmath37 .    keeping in mind the boost - invariant central - rapidity region expected to be formed in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions",

    "it indicates a highly nonlocal nature of this term in the configuration space ; the production rate depends not only on the instantaneous strength of the field but also on its derivatives .",

    "_ substituting @xmath52 from eq . ( 2.12 ) in eq .",
    "( 2.15 ) and then substituting the resulting expression in eq . ( 2.5 ) we get @xmath53 thus the probability @xmath54 in eq .",

    "( 2.16 ) we define ( for @xmath56 ) @xmath57 and substitute @xmath58 in eq .

    "@xcite predict @xmath63-dependence which is consistent with eq .",

    "@xcite that if a particle is produced at @xmath29 and @xmath28 , it must appear with the longitudinal velocity @xmath77 .",
    "( this is reminiscent of the thomas - fermi approximation in condensed - matter physics . )",
    "it allows us to identify the spatial and momentum rapidities and we can write @xmath78    combining these results we finally get the new source term : @xmath79 where the electric field @xmath60 and the function @xmath80 are defined in eqs .",
