    "the noncommutative cp violating effects has been examined at low energies and it was ephasized that cp violation due to noncommutative geometry was comparable to the one due to the standard model ( sm ) only , for a noncommutative scale @xmath7 .",
    "noncommutative sm ( ncsm ) building has been studied in @xcite and recently , the determination of triple neutral gauge boson couplings has been done in @xcite .",

    "the parameter @xmath6 is taken the average magnitude of the tensor @xmath11 .",
    "ncsm can be constructed at least up to @xmath15 by replacing the ordinary products by @xmath12 product .",
    "this replacement modifies the feynman rules considerably ( see the appendix of @xcite ) .    in our work ,",
    "we study the form factors appearing in the inclusive decay @xmath0 , in the framework of the ncsm . when the noncommutative effects are switched on , the form factors due to the sm are modified and new structures with the corresponding form factors arise .",

    "this is a small number which creates weak noncommutative effects in the calculation of form factors .",
    "however , these noncommutative effects may be stronger for the decays including heavy flavors .",
    "on the other hand , this parameter is a new source for the cp violation which exists with the help of the complex cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements in the ordinary sm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the structures and the form factors appearing in the @xmath0 decay in the sm , including the non - commutative effects .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analysis of these form factors and our discussions .",
    "in this section , we calculate the form factors of the decay @xmath0 in the framework of the sm , including the noncommutative effects . as it is well known , @xmath0 decay is created by flavor changing neutral currents at loop level in the sm .",
    "the possible interactions at one loop level are self energy and vertex type ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . at this stage",
    ", we use the on - shell renormalization scheme to get rid of the divergences appearing in the ordinary sm and obtain a gauge invariant vertex function .",
    "notice that , in this scheme , the self energy diagrams do not contribute and only the vertex part survives .",
    "when the non - commutative effects are switched on , there appears new structures and the corresponding form factors , that contain new uv and ir divergences .",
    "use of on - shell renormalization scheme helps one to get a gauge invariant vertex function however , the form factors appearing due to the noncommutative effects still need renormalization .",
    "now , we will present the calculations @xcite to get the form factors for the decay underconsideration .",
    "the starting point of the calculation is to use the exponential representation for the propagators , i.e. the schwinger parametrization @xmath18 and to obtain the denominator of the momentum integral for the vertex function , which we call the core integral , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath3 ( @xmath21 ) is four momentum of @xmath5 ( @xmath22 ) quark , @xmath23 and @xmath4 is virtual gluon four momentum . here , the new factor @xmath24 is due to the non - commutative geometry and it can be rewritten as @xmath25 .",

    "we will summarize the procedure used in the following :    * calculating the the numerator of the integral by differentiating the momentum integrated core integral with respect to the auxilary variable @xmath31 and set @xmath31 to zero at the end . * applying the wick rotation @xmath32 and using the identity @xmath33 * making the rescaling @xmath34 * redefining the core integral by introducing the uv regulator @xmath35 as @xmath36 \\,\\",
    ", , \\label{int3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41    where @xmath42 .",
    "with this procedure one obtains all the structures and the corresponding raw coefficients due to the decay under consideration .",
    "now , we use the on - shell renormalization scheme and extract the nonvanishing structures to get a gauge invariant result . in this scheme , only the vertex diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) contributes and the self energy diagrams vanish . using the raw bare vertex function , @xmath43 , introducing the counterms @xmath44 to satisfy the expression @xmath45 where @xmath46 is @xmath47 and neglecting the @xmath22-quark mass we get @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the gluon momentum 4-vector and @xmath50 dependent functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are proportional to the charge radius and dipole form factors .",
    "@xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the new form factors appearing when the noncommutative effects are switched on and they read as @xmath56 in the calculation of the coefficients , at first , the @xmath57 integrations are taken .",
    "these integrations bring the modified bessel functions of first and second type . for the high energy limit , namely @xmath58 , or the low energy limit @xmath59 simultaneously",
    ", the integration of @xmath60 and @xmath61 over @xmath57 does not bring any divergence . however , the @xmath57 integrations of @xmath62 and @xmath63 result in the modified bessel functions of first type , where the logarithmic divercences appear . here",
    "we assume that these divercences can be overcome by adding the necessary counter terms , i.e. the ncsm model is renormalizable at least at one loop level , similar to ncqed @xcite .",
    "the result of the integration of the form factor @xmath64 over @xmath57 is proportional to the cut - off factor @xmath65 .",
    "fortunately , this term is irrelevant because of the following reason ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if we consider the uv limit , namely , @xmath66 or @xmath67 , this term is finite .",
    "however as @xmath68 tends to zero , we have @xmath69 and therefore @xmath70 .",
    "since the structure due to @xmath64 contains the term proportional to @xmath71 , this term is irrelevant in the ir limit .",
    "finally , we end up with the form factors @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 : @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the integration over the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be performed easily and we get @xmath81 for @xmath82 , @xmath83 , the internal u and c quarks are on mass - shell and an absorptive part appears in the coefficients related with the light quark part .",
    "notice that when the non - commutative effects are switched off the form factors @xmath74 and @xmath75 disappears and we obtain the form factors in the ordinary sm .",
    "this section is devoted to the analysis of the form factors appearing in the @xmath0 process in the framework of the sm including noncommutative effects .",
    "the new parameter existing in this geometry is @xmath84 and it is at the order of the magnitude of @xmath17 for the process underconsideration .",
    "this factor is also a new source for the cp violating effects in addition to the complex ckm matrix elements in the sm , @xmath85 in our case .",
    "it enters into expressions as an exponential and its odd powers in the expansion of the exponential factor bring new cp violating effects , even for real ckm matrix elements . in our work , we study @xmath84 and the @xmath86 dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the form factors . here",
    ", we use the parametrization @xmath87 and @xmath86 is proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath85 , which is the only source of the cp violating effects in the commutative sm . note that we take the numerical value @xmath88 .    in fig .",
