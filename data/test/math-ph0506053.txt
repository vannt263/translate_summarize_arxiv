    "@xcite , there has been a great deal of interest in finding relations between the geometry of a manifold or a graph and spectral properties of the laplacian defined on it .",
    "the impressive works @xcite , which have been chosen by way of example , witness the steady progress achieved in recent years and provide further references . whereas laplacians on manifolds dominated the scene in the earlier years , the rise of spectral graph theory @xcite in the late 1980s and 90s has contributed to deepen our understanding of the discrete case .",
    "spectral theory of random graphs , however , is still a widely open field .",
    "the very recent contributions @xcite take a probabilistic point of view to derive heat - kernel estimates for laplacians on _ supercritical _ bernoulli bond - percolation graphs in the @xmath0-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice .",
    "on the other hand , traditional methods from spectral theory are used in @xcite to investigate the integrated density of states of laplacians on _ subcritical _ bond - percolation graphs .",
    "depending on the boundary condition that is chosen at cluster borders , two different types of _ lifshits asymptotics _ at spectral edges were found @xcite .",
    "for example , the integrated density of states of the neumann laplacian behaves as @xmath1 at the lower spectral edge for bond probabilities @xmath2 below the percolation threshold @xmath3 .",
    "we have put quotation marks here , because , strictly speaking , one should take appropriate logarithms on both sides .",
    "the lifshits exponent @xmath4 in is independent of the spatial dimension @xmath0 .",
    "this was explained by the fact that , asymptotically , @xmath5 is dominated by the smallest eigenvalues which arise from very long _ linear clusters _ in this case .",
    "in contrast , for the dirichlet laplacian and @xmath6 , it was found that @xmath7 we note that @xmath8 .",
    "the lifshits exponent in comes out as @xmath9 , because the dominating small dirichlet eigenvalues arise from large _ fully connected cube- or sphere - like clusters_. thus , depending on the boundary condition ( and the spectral edge ) different geometric graph properties show up in the integrated density of states .",
    "we refer to the literature cited in @xcite for a discussion of other spectral properties of these and closely related operators , for the history of the problem and what is known in the physics literature .",
    "lifshits asymptotics for a neumann laplacian on erds  rnyi random graphs are studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we pursue the investigations of @xcite and ask what happens to and in the _ supercritical phase _ of bond - percolation graphs . clearly",
    ", one would not expect the contribution of the finite clusters to alter the picture completely .",
    "but for the infinite percolating cluster , the story may be different .",
    "indeed , we will prove that the percolating cluster produces a _",
    "van hove asymptotics _",
    "@xmath10 in the neumann case for @xmath11 .",
    "there is also an additional lifshits - tail behaviour due to finite clusters , but it is hidden under the dominating asymptotics .",
    "loosely speaking , is true because the percolating cluster looks like the full regular lattice on very large length scales ( bigger than the correlation length ) for @xmath11 . on smaller scales",
    "its structure is more like that of a jagged fractal .",
    "the neumann laplacian does not care about these small - scale holes , however .",
    "all that is needed for to be true is the existence of a suitable @xmath0-dimensional , infinite grid . in contrast",
    ", the dirichlet laplacian does care about holes at all scales so that continues to hold for @xmath12 , as we shall prove .",
    "low - lying dirichlet eigenvalues require large fully connected cube- or sphere - like regions , and this is a large - deviation event .",
    "closely related large - deviation results for laplacians on percolation graphs have been obtained in @xcite . to be precise , @xcite refer to the pseudo - dirichlet laplacian @xmath13 in the sense of our definition  [ deltadef](ii ) below . considering both site- and bond - percolation graphs , and using a discrete version of the method of enlargement of obstacles , antal @xcite derives the long - time asymptotics for the mean ( i.e.  annealed ) hitting - time distribution of the set of absent sites ( resp .",

    "biskup and knig work in the setting of the parabolic anderson model , which contains @xmath13 on _ site_-percolation graphs as a special case .",

    "however , his results apply to a random walk which is generated by @xmath243 instead of @xmath86 .",
    "hence , some additional comments are needed to adapt his results , and we address this issue now .    according to the preceding remark the proposition is established , if we show that barlow s quenched upper bound for the return probability , i.e.  the special case @xmath244 of the upper bound in thm .",
    "2 in @xcite , applies also to the random walk generated by @xmath86 .",
    "eventually , the upper bound in thm .  2 in @xcite is reduced to prop .  3.1 in @xcite via thm .  1 ,",
    "6.1 , thm .  5.7 and thm .  3.8  the latter being nothing but the off - diagonal generalisation of prop .  3.1 , so",
    "we do not need it here .",
    "the reduction does not make use of any specific properties of the random walk s generator .",
    "hence , all that remains to check is prop .  3.1 . in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that some of the constants in the proof of prop .",
    "3.1 must be modified for our purpose , but this does not have any consequences .",
    "in addition , the proof of prop .",
    "3.1 also requires estimates ( 1.7 ) and ( 1.8 ) of lemma  1.1 in @xcite .",
    "estimate ( 1.8 ) follows from estimate ( 1.5 ) , as is argued in the proof of lemma 1.1(b ) in @xcite .",
    "this argument applies in our situation , too .",
    "so , in the end , we have to verify the validity of ( 1.7 ) and ( 1.5 ) in @xcite for the random walk generated by @xmath86 .",
    "estimate ( 1.5 ) is seen to hold as a special case of cor .",
    "11 in @xcite .",
    "the upper bound in estimate ( 1.7 ) can be inferred , for example , from thm .",

    "v.2 and its proof with the choice @xmath245 .",
    "this choice corresponds to a weak isoperimetric inequality which merely reflects that the percolating cluster contains an infinitely long path . from this point of view , the weak @xmath246-decay of the upper bound in estimate ( 1.7 ) does not come as a surprise . finally , the lower bound in estimate ( 1.7 ) arises solely from the uniform growth condition @xmath247 for the volume of a ball around @xmath222 with radius @xmath248 .",
    "such type of results are well known for heat kernels on manifolds and also for discrete - time random walks @xcite . to employ them here ,",

    "using this , the lower bound in ( 1.7 ) follows from thm .",

    "for the lower bound , one has to choose @xmath263 large enough such that the constant , which arises from the application of both estimates in , is strictly positive .",
    "proposition  [ heatkernel ] and lemma  [ tauber ] establish the desired van hove bounds for @xmath266 .",
    "therefore , it remains to show that the finite clusters do not spoil this behaviour . since @xmath267 for all @xmath268 , only an appropriate upper bound is required for the contribution of the finite clusters .",
    "we shall show in eq .   below that @xmath269 obeys even a lifshits - type upper bound , which will then complete the proof .",
    "the lifshits behaviour for the contribution of the finite clusters in the percolating phase arises from the cluster - size distribution  in the same way as it was shown to arise in the non - percolating phase in @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath270 for all @xmath1650,\\infty[$ ] . here",
    "@xmath271 is the event that the origin belongs to a finite cluster , say @xmath272 , and @xmath273 denotes the number of its vertices .",
