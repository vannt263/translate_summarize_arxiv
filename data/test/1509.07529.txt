    "the kinematics of objects in the vicinity of such a body are expected to differ from those based on newton s theory of gravity .",
    "the nasa / stanford spaceborne mission gravity probe  b ( ) was designed to measure these differences with four gyroscopes essentially freely falling around earth , in a polar orbit at an altitude of about 640 km . according to gr",
    ", the gyroscopes spin axes should precess by @xmath46  yr@xmath5 in a north - south direction due to the curving of space - time by the earth s mass , and by @xmath439  in an eastward direction due to the warping of space - time by the earth s angular momentum .",
    "these precessions are dubbed the ",
    "geodetic \" effect and the  frame - dragging , \" ( `` lense - thirring , '' or `` gravitomagnetic '' ) effect , respectively , and can be considered as rotations of any near - earth inertial frame relative to the distant universe .    the gyroscopes were set spinning within a quartz block with respect to which , through superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) ,",
    "each of the spin axes precessions could be measured with an accuracy of 100  within @xmath440 days .",
    "the quartz block was bonded to a @xmath415  cm diameter quartz optical telescope .",
    "all of these devices  the quartz block , the squids , and the quartz telescope ( together termed the probe )  were placed in a dewar filled with liquid helium and cooled to a temperature of 1.8 k. ideally , the orientation of the probe could be best provided by pointing the telescope to one suitable quasar , one of the most distant compact types of single object in the universe .",
    "however , quasars were too dim for the telescope to track .",
    "only stars in our galaxy were bright enough .",
    "the challenge was therefore to find a ",
    "guide star , \" bright enough for the on - board telescope to track , sufficiently isolated to limit light contamination , and suitably located to not unnecessarily decrease the accuracy of the measurement of the precessions of the gyroscopes .",
    "then the guide star s motion on the sky needed to be measured with respect to quasars or distant galaxies so that the precession of the gyroscopes could be determined with respect to the distant universe .",

    "we give a synopsis of these papers .",
    "a suitable guide star for  had to simultaneously meet a number of requirements :    * the motion of the star needed to be known or measurable with an uncertainty small enough not to significantly increase the prelaunch anticipated standard error of  of @xmath60.5  in each of the two precessions .",
    "the specific requirement was that the standard error be @xmath70.14  for measurements of the star s motion in each coordinate . in 1990 , when we entered the first stage of our search for a suitable guide star , no star s ( or any other celestial object s ) motion on the sky",
    "was known with such accuracy in the optical .",
    "such accuracy had previously been achieved only in the radio .",
    "pioneered by @xcite , astrometric measurements with the radio technique of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) of a quasar relative to another quasar nearby on the sky yielded a proper - motion estimate with a standard error less than half of the requirement for  @xcite .",
    "therefore vlbi appeared to be at that time the only option to determine the motion of a suitable guide star with the desired accuracy . *",
    "the star needed to be sufficiently bright in the radio , preferably with a flux density at least of order 1  mjy , for vlbi astrometry measurements to be successful . * the star needed to be sufficiently bright in the optical , at least 7th magnitude , for the on - board telescope to detect . *",
    "the star s angular distance , @xmath8 , from the ecliptic needed to be between 20@xmath9 and 40@xmath9 .",
    "the lower limit was set by the requirement that , with a suitable sun shield at the telescope , sunlight not enter the dewar and boil off the liquid helium .",
    "the upper limit was set by the power requirements of the spacecraft , since the solar panels were fixed to the spacecraft , which would continually point to the guide star , making the power received by the solar panels dependent on @xmath8 . *",
    "the star needed to be located as close as possible to the celestial equator , so as to maximize the sensitivity of the measurement of the frame - dragging precession , which essentially decreases with the cosine of the star s declination . * the star needed to be sufficiently isolated on the sky .",
    "neighbouring stars or reflection nebulae could possibly intolerably decrease the accuracy of the pointing of the telescope to the star s center of brightness .    to find the most suitable guide star for , we conducted a vla survey at 8.4 ghz from 1990 to 1992 of @xmath41200 stars with v magnitude @xmath76.0 and a declination between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "no single stars were found in the survey with a flux density above @xmath41  mjy .",
    "in fact , we detected only previously known radio stars , all of them binaries of the rs canum venaticorum type ( see also , for a later survey , * ? ? ?",
    "we identified four potentially suitable guide stars : @xmath12  andromeda  ( hr  8961 , @xmath13 declination ) , hr  1099 ( @xmath14 ) , hr  5110  ( @xmath15 ) , and ( hr  8703 , @xmath16 ) . after investigating each of the four candidates with vlbi , studying the sky fields around them in the optical , and checking on possible vlbi reference sources for each of them , we selected  as the most suitable for",
    ".      is a binary with a giant primary and sun - type secondary .",
    "we summarize its optical characteristics and previously known properties in table [ topt ] .",
    "the radius of the primary is @xmath413.3 @xmath3 0.6 , which translates at a distance of  of @xmath4100 pc , to an angular radius of @xmath40.64 @xmath3 0.03 mas .",
    "this radius is comparable to the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the synthesized beam of a global vlbi array operating at 8.4 ghz , and therefore in principle allows for an accurate determination of the location of the radio emission with respect to the center of the primary .",
    "a prerequisite for successful guide star tracking was that the onboard telescope be able to lock sufficiently accurately on the center of the optical disk of the star ( or a point with an offset from this center constant during the mission ) .",
    "one concern here was the appearance of variable dark spots on the primary , shown by doppler imaging and photometry to cover @xmath415% of the star s surface .",
    "if the variations in the size or location of these spots resulted in a linear trend over the course of the  mission in the centroid of optical brightness , relative to the center of the disk of the i m peg primary , then that trend would have the same effect on the  data reduction as an equal error in our vlbi measurement of the proper motion of i m peg .",
    "such a trend is not necessarily implausible , given the year - to - year variations in i m peg s optical brightness and the astrophysical plausibility of variations in typical spot latitudes analogous to the systematic variations of sunspot locations on the sun .",
    "however , @xcite showed , through extensive spot mapping spanning the duration of the  mission , that any error due to variability in the spot pattern would yield no more than a  0.04  drift in the optical center .",
    "a second concern was the surroundings of i m peg on the sky .",
    "any star or nebula within the field of view of the telescope when locked on , possibly combined with s photometric variability , could cause systematic astrometric errors .",
    "however , for , no other star within , e.g. @xmath17 , is brighter than v magnitude 10 , which can be compared with the corresponding relative large brightness of , that varied during the mission only between v magnitude 5.7 and 6.0 . all in all , through extensive optical and even millimetric observations of the co(j=1@xmath180 ) line ( the latter to search for any molecular cloud that could be associated with a reflection nebula ) , we constrained any astrometric systematic error to a negligible value : the combined error from dark spots , neighbouring stars , and a nebula , combined with the photometric variability of , we estimated to be smaller than 0.05  .",

    "it was used as a reference source for  from 1991 to 1994 @xcite , and could therefore extend the time baseline of our vlbi observations .",
    "the disadvantage is the complexity of 3c  454.3 s structure and its superluminal nature . in figure  [ f2images ]",
    "we identified six components of which the easternmost component , c1 , is still compact at the highest angular resolution , has a flat or inverted high - frequency spectrum @xcite , and is located almost exactly at the same position ( ) as the core of the quasar seen at 43 ghz @xcite .",
    "the component c1 was therefore considered to be the core at 8.4 ghz , the part most closely related to the supermassive black hole and to the center of mass of the quasar ; it was thus the reference point in the quasar s structure for our astrometric measurements .",
    "the other components are moving away from c1 , with apparent speeds of up to @xmath45  c ( ) .",
    "the remaining sources were both rather compact , so that the brightness peak could simply be taken as the reference point in the structure ; their disadvantages were that b2250 + 194 was located relatively far away from  and b2252 + 172 was rather faint ( with an unknown redshift ) .",
    "in addition , we used geodetic and astrometric vlbi observations regularly conducted over many years to determine the limit on the proper motion of two of the three reference sources , 3c  454.3 and b2250 + 194 .",
    "these determinations were made without consideration of a particular reference point in the structure of the two sources but were made with respect to a celestial reference frame , crf .",
    "this frame is defined by a large number of extragalactic radio sources distributed over the sky and is for our purposes essentially the same as the international celestial reference frame , icrf2 @xcite .",
    "all in all , we took c1 in 3c  454.3 as the primary reference point with respect to which the motion of  was measured .",
    "the other measurements served to determine the stability of c1 on the sky so that finally the motion of  could be determined with respect to the distant universe .",
    "to determine the motion of  relative to c1 and test c1 s stability relative to the brightness peaks of the other two reference sources , we took into account :    *  is catalogued as a binary .",

    ", we spread a sufficiently large number of vlbi measurements over eight and a half years to be able to determine any nearly constant change of the proper motion with time (  proper acceleration \" ) , or place a limit on it . * for the best determination of s parallax , we spread the vlbi measurement epochs appropriately to cover the different seasons each year .",
    "similarly , to allow us to model any orbital component of the motion of the radio emission , we carefully distributed the epochs over the phase of the binary orbit , which could be computed from earlier spectroscopic results . * to measure the time - variable brightness distributions of  and the three reference sources , and in particular to identify c1 in 3c 454.3 , we selected each vlbi observation session to be long enough to ensure that the  coverage was sufficiently dense for us to obtain excellent imaging of the sources . * since we expected  to fluctuate strongly in radio brightness , and since we knew that radio emission from b2252 + 174 was relatively weak , we needed our vlbi array to be sufficiently sensitive to nearly guarantee detection of the sources in each observing session . *",
    "lastly , we needed an observing frequency for which receivers were available at each of the telescopes of the vlbi array , and which guaranteed sufficiently high angular resolution and low system temperatures .",
    "all said , 35 sessions of astrometric vlbi observations were made between 1997 january 16 and 2005 july 16 with about four sessions every year , each about 11 to 15 h long .",
    "the observations were made with a global array of 12 to 16 radio telescopes comprised of most or all of : mpifr s 100 m telescope at effelsberg , germany ; nasa / caltech / jpl s 70 m dsn telescopes at robledo , spain , goldstone , ca , and tidbinbilla , australia ; nrao s ten 25 m telescopes of the vlba , across the u.s.a ; nrao s phased vla , equivalent to a 130 m telescope , near socorro , nm ; and , at early times , nrcan s 46 m algonquin radio telescope near pembroke , ont , canada , and nrao s 43  m telescope in green bank , wv .",
    "the observing frequency was 8.4 ghz .",
    "all of these vlbi observations were made to extract interferometric phase delays related to the difference of arrival times of a radio wave from a celestial source at each pair of antennas of a vlbi array .",
    "such observations allow the most accurate astrometric measurements @xcite and can yield relative positions and proper motions referenced to particular points in the structure of the sources with uncertainties as low as @xmath410   and @xmath410  , respectively ( for the earliest such measurements , see , e.g. , marcaide & shapiro 1983 ; bartel et al . 1986 ; and for a recent review , see reid & honma 2014 )",

    "for the first 23 sessions , we used a typical sequence of 3c  454.3 ( 80  s ) - i m  peg ( 170  s ) - b2250 + 194 ( 80  s ) . for the remaining 12 sessions , b2252 + 172 was included in the observations and the sequence was altered to 3c  454.3 ( 80  s ) - i m   peg ( 125  s ) - b2250 + 194 ( 80  s ) - 3c  454.3 ( 80  s ) - i m  peg ( 125  s ) - b2250 + 194 ( 80  s ) - b2252 + 172 ( 90  s ) .",
    "in addition to the astrometric 8.4 ghz observations , we also observed once at 5.0  ghz and once at 15.0  ghz , to allow investigation of the compactness and spectral properties of the components of the sources .",
    "almost all observations were recorded in both right and left circular polarization , and all were processed with the vlba correlator at socorro , nm .",
    "we used a custom software package ( ) that allowed us to analyze the data efficiently .",
    "first , we connected the phases and removed the 2@xmath55 phase ambiguities to generate the correct phase delays .",
    "then we corrected the phase delays for the effects of the troposphere and the ionosphere with _ a priori _ estimates .",
    "we further processed them with a kalman filter to model the residuals of the troposphere and the ionosphere , and the clock offset at each telescope from the one chosen as the reference clock for the vlbi array .",
    "then , for the more extended source 3c  454.3 , the structure effects were removed from the phase delays based on the reference point , c1 , defined with images made with nrao s aips software package .",
    "the other two reference sources were sufficiently compact that no correction for their source structure was needed .",
    "the relative weakness of s radio emission , and sometimes also that of b2252 + 172 , made it necessary for us to develop a special technique for the analysis of  vlbi data .",
    "it combines the advantages of parametric model - fitting via weighted least - squares applicable for the relatively strong sources 3c 454.3 and b2250 + 194 with the sensitivity of phase - referenced mapping , the latter required for  and b2252 + 172 .",
    "the merged analysis technique yielded superior results to the phase - referenced mapping technique ( ) .",
    "the radio emission from  varied from session to session , reflecting the complex astrophysical nature of the environment of the star . in most cases",
    "the images of  showed only one clearly defined component . in these cases",
    "the coordinates were determined for the maximum of a two - dimensional gaussian fit to that component . in the remaining cases",
    ", there was more than one local maximum of approximately equal brightness in the emission region : in eight cases there were two such maxima , and in one case there were three , all of them significant .",
    "in such cases , we took the position of i m peg to be the mean position of the different maxima .",
    "the final result of the analysis of the  vlbi observations was a set of coordinates with statistical standard errors for each source and each observing epoch .",
    "these sets were the basis for the study of the motion , or upper bounds on it , of the sources with respect to each other .",
    "in addition , we analyzed geodetic astrometric vlbi observations and made use of interferometric group delays .",
    "group delays are given by @xmath60 these are observations of thousands of sources from all over the sky .",
    "these observations are done on a routine basis , independent of the  program . for 3c  454.3",
    "we used all available data from a total of 1,119 observing sessions , from 1980 to 2008 . in support of , the second reference source , b2250 + 194 ,",
    "was included in 38 sessions of routine geodetic astrometric group - delay observations between 1997 and 2008 .",
    "group - delay observations have the advantage that 2@xmath55 ambiguities are not inherent in the data and that the positions are determined relative to a celestial reference frame ( crf ) .",
    "the disadvantage , however , is that the parameter , @xmath52 , was not determined and that therefore the exact reference point in the brightness distribution of the sources for the position measurement remained undefined .",
    "all available geodetic astrometric data with a total of 6.5 million group - delay determinations were processed via least - squares and yielded estimates of coordinates with statistical standard errors for 3c 454.3 and b2250 + 194 for each observing session , keeping the coordinates of the other sources constant .",

    "these errors can for instance be due to uncorrected effects from source structure and/or atmospheric and ionospheric variations , and are difficult to quantify .",
    "therefore the total standard errors of the position determinations were determined partly empirically by including a particular constant for each fit .",

    "no matter whether there is some motion due to activity near the black hole or not , the 1@xmath64 upper limits of the proper - motion values for c1 relative to b2250 + 194 and b2250 + 194 relative to the crf are each smaller than 40 .",
    "combining the phase - delay proper - motion determination of c1 relative to b2250 + 194 with the group - delay proper - motion determination of b2250 + 194 relative to the crf gives for the time period from 1998 to 2005 a 1@xmath64 standard error for the mean position of c1 in the crf of 45 and 68 .",
    "the proper motion of c1 relative to the crf for that same period is @xmath65  and @xmath66  in  and , respectively , which we do not consider significant .",

    "with the stationarity of the reference point in 3c 454.3 determined , the motion of  relative to the distant universe could be analyzed .",
    "five kinds of motion needed to be considered :    * proper motion mainly due to the motion of  relative to the motion of the sun in the galaxy , * annual parallax due to the orbital motion of earth around the sun , together with the much smaller contribution of the motion of the sun with respect to the solar system barycenter , * change of proper motion over time due to a hypothetical third member of the  binary system , * orbital motion around the common center of mass of the binary , and * erratic motion of the center of radio emission within the binary system .      to determine the proper motion , parallax , proper acceleration , and orbital motion , we used weighted least - squares to fit a linearized model to the 35 determinations of the positions of the reference point in  relative to the position of c1 in 3c 454.3 .",
    "the uncertainties of these position determinations are hard to compute theoretically .",
