    "hydrogen bond is an important interaction present in different systems in nature ; the most famous examples of its occurrence are in water molecules and the dna double helix , @xcite and references therein .",
    "particularly , biological macromolecules as proteins , nucleic acids and carboxylic acids have the molecular groups nh and oh in their structures .",
    "these groups induce the hydrogen bonds which are essential to stabilize the structures and play an important role in the behavior of these macromolecules .",
    "several other systems like clathrates and liquid crystals present hydrogen bonds in their structures @xcite .",
    "few years ago a modern definition of the hydrogen bond following a list of criteria was recommended , after a survey on recent results of the subject , @xcite . according to this definition",
    "the hydrogen bond is an attractive interaction between a hydrogen atom from a molecule or a molecular fragment x - h in which x is more electronegative than h , and an atom or a group of atoms in the same or a different molecule , in which there is evidence of bond formation .",
    "the hydrogen bond can be classified as a donor - acceptor interaction .",
    "the notation of the bond is x - h@xmath1y , where the dots represent the bond , x - h is the hydrogen bond donor and y is the acceptor anion .",
    "the covalent bond is represented by x - h and the hydrogen bond is represented by h@xmath1y .",
    "the high electro - negativity of atom x compared with the hydrogen atom in the x - h chemical bond makes the hydrogen to share part of its electronic density .",
    "the different spectroscopy techniques , such as , raman , infrared ( ir ) , terahertz ( thz ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy , provide the identification of the vibrational transitions of the molecular groups involved , since they are sensitive to changes in the spectrum .",
    "therefore , it is possible to know if a specific molecular group participate of the hydrogen bond , because the vibrational spectrum changes .    in this work",
    "it is proposed that quantum confinement effect is the main cause of delocalization of the vibrational spectrum of nh and oh groups when hydrogen bonds are formed .",
    "quantum confinement can be defined as the restricted space where the particles can move and it is generally introduced by a potential barrier created , for instance , due to electrostatic potentials , the presence of an interface between different materials or the presence of a surface .",
    "the simplest case of confinement consists of a particle subject to an infinite square well potential treated in introductory quantum mechanics , @xcite . in this confined regime , the motion of a particle is restricted to a well defined region of space and there is the appearance of discrete energy levels due to quantization effects .",
    "they appear once the size of the barrier is of the same magnitude as the de broglie wavelength of the particle wave function .",
    "confined systems have interesting applications ; in material science the quantum confinement effect is well studied theoretically and experimentally in semiconductor physics , mainly in the study of quantum dots , @xcite , @xcite . if the size of the material is reduced , the electronic and optical properties are drastically changed and can be controlled ; this is one of the main subjects of nanostructure science , @xcite . there are other cases that may also be studied by confinement as , for instance , a system subjected to high pressure , @xcite .",
    "recent studies focus on theoretical as well as experimental investigations of hydrogen / halogen bonds in different confining environments , @xcite - @xcite .    in the approach used in this work",
    "the confinement is introduced by a potential barrier . in the formation of the hydrogen bond ,",
    "the acceptor atom of the hydrogen bond introduces a barrier which prevents the free oscillation of the hydrogen atom attached to the donor atom .",
    "in this situation , the hydrogen is confined between two atoms and the energy levels are distorted by this confinement , i. e. , there are vibrational frequency shifts .",
    "vibrational frequency shifts can also be induced by high pressure , @xcite -@xcite .",
    "thus , the main interest of this paper is to study the hydrogen bonds present in biological macromolecules , particularly , to determine the vibrational transitions related to oh and nh groups . to overcome this proposal we used an analytical methodology based on the variational method associated to supersymmetric quantum mechanics , ( sqm ) .",
    "the confined quantum mechanical problem is settled by considering the schr@xmath2dinger equation depending on a potential with a potential barrier .",
    "considering that the hydrogen bonds are highly directional , the vibrations of the groups studied are better described by the one - dimensional morse potential . if not by the potential barrier ( without confinement ) this potential presents exact analytical solution , @xcite . however , by considering the confined case ( with confinement ) the problem is not exactly solvable and therefore an approximation method has to be introduced . at this point",
    "we use the formalism of sqm to calculate the spectrum of wave functions and energies and use the variational method to treat the confined case , with a potential barrier .",
    "the transition energy between two adjacent states is calculated and the values obtained are compared with experimental spectroscopy data to validate the proposed hypothesis . the formalism of sqm coupled to the variational method has been a successful methodology to study many problems , in particular , the confined systems , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "other theoretical models based on the use of the morse potential have been proposed to describe high frequency and low frequency vibration modes of the hydrogen bonds , @xcite-@xcite . in the approach proposed here , unlike these models , there is no need either to use any coupling theory nor to enter new parameters in the morse potential .",
    "the data used here refer only to the covalent bonding and to the length of the hydrogen bond , which reduces significantly the number of parameters .",
    "a schematic model of a hydrogen bond between atoms x and y is shown in figure 1 .    in a hydrogen bonding",
    ", the hydrogen nuclei may oscillate within a region determined between a minimum distance ( @xmath3 ) and a maximum distance ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is given by the covalent radius ( @xmath5 ) of atom x and @xmath4 is given by the length of the hydrogen bond ( @xmath6 ) subtracted by the van der waals radius ( @xmath7 ) of the acceptor atom , i.e. , [ xmax ] x_max = l_x y - x_vw the origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of the atom x. any distance used is computed from this point and it is considered center - to - center . the covalent radius is adopted by the condition of impenetrability of the hydrogen atom donor ; the employment of the van der waals radius is justified because it is a measure of the volume excluded by the acceptor atom , i.e. , the hydrogen can not penetrate this region .",
    "the atoms are considered as hard spheres and the hydrogen is treated as a material point , since the electron cloud is shared with the donor and the acceptor atoms .    as mentioned before , the vibrational energy of the system is described through the confined one - dimensional morse potential .",
    "this potential has been widely used to describe oscillations of diatomic molecules , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the energy absorbed / emitted is obtained from the calculation of the energies of the ground state ( @xmath8 ) ( for nh and oh ) , the first excited state ( @xmath9 ) ( for nh and oh ) and the second excited state ( @xmath10 ) ( only for oh ) .",
    "the energy of the absorbed / emitted photon is obtained from the difference between two adjacent levels . the energies of the confined case are evaluated by using the variational method associated to the formalism of sqm .",
    "sqm is an algebraic method commonly used to exploit different aspects of non - relativistic quantum mechanical systems .",
    "it is particularly efficient to solve exactly all the quantum potential problems by means of the hamiltonian factorization , thus providing the entire spectrum of wave functions with their respective energies together with a hierarchy of hamiltonians , all related by the supersymmetric algebra , @xcite . on the other hand , when the potential is non - exactly solvable , such as in a confined system , an approximation technique is needed and the variational method has already appeared as fully appropriate , @xcite .",
    "thus , using the superalgebra a given hamiltonian can be factorized in terms of bosonic operators . in @xmath11 units ,",
    "the schr@xmath2dinger equation can be rewritten as h_1 = -d^2 d x^2 + v_1(x ) = a_1^+a_1 ^ - + e_0^(1 ) where @xmath12 is the lowest eigenvalue with ground state wave function satisfying a_1 ^ - _ 0^(1)(x)=0 and with the bosonic operators defined as a_1^ = ( + w_1(x ) ) where the superpotential @xmath13 satisfies the riccati equation [ riccati ] w_1 ^ 2 - d dxw_1= v_1(x ) - e_0^(1 ) .",
    "and the ground state wave function has the following form [ eigenfunction ] _ 0^(1 ) ( x ) = n exp ( -_0^x w_1(|x ) d|x ) .",
    "thus a whole hierarchy of hamiltonians can be constructed , with simple relations connecting the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the @xmath14-members , h_n = a_n^+a_n^- + e_0^(n ) , a_n^ = ( + w_n(x ) ) [ psis ] _",
    "n^(1 ) = a_1^+a_2^+ ...",
    "_0^(n+1)e_n^(1 ) = e_0^(n+1 ) . in equation ( [ psis ] )",
    ", the upper index between parentheses refers to the hierarchy hamiltonian member and the lower index to the level within the hierarchy .",
    "the one - dimensional morse potential@xcite , is given by v_m = d_e ( e^-2(x - x_eq ) - 2e^-(x - x_eq ) ) where @xmath15 is the dissociation energy of molecule , @xmath16 is the parameter related to the width of potential well and @xmath17 is the inter - nuclear equilibrium distance .",
    "the @xmath16 parameter may be determined by treating the molecule as a frequency oscillator @xmath18 and through experimental data . by expanding the morse potential in a taylor series around the equilibrium position to the second order",
    "we find that [ beta ] = ( 2 ^ 2 d_e)^. the schr@xmath2dinger equation for a molecule subject to the morse potential , according to the model , is written in one - dimensional cartesian coordinates with the change of variables , @xmath19 . after multiplying both sides by @xmath20",
    ", we obtain the schr@xmath2dinger equation [ se ] -d^2 ( y ) dy^2 + ^2(e^-2(y- y_eq ) - 2e^-(y - y_eq))(y ) = ( y ) where [ lambda ] ^2= 2 d_e^2 ^ 2 and = 2 e^2 ^ 2 where @xmath21 is the reduced mass of the system . the hamiltonian operator in equation ( [ se ] )",
    "is given by [ morse - hamiltonian ] h_m = -d^2 dy^2 + ^2(e^-2(y- y_eq ) - 2e^-(y - y_eq ) ) since the schr@xmath2dinger equation is exactly solvable , the process of factorization can be completely made and the whole hierarchy can be evaluated .",
    "the result is , @xcite v_n+1(y ) = ^2 ( e^-2(y - y_eq ) - 2e^-(y - y_eq ) ) + 2n e^-(y - y_eq ) w_n+1(y ) = - e^-(y - y_eq ) + ( - 2n + 12 ) [ non - confined energy ] _ 0^(n+1 ) = -(- 2n + 12)^2 .",
    "+ in addition we can calculate exactly the wave functions .",
    "the ground state wave function is evaluated by using equation ( [ eigenfunction ] ) and is given by [ psi1 ] _ 0^(1)(y ) exp ( -e^-(y - y_eq ) -y(- ) ) .",
    "this wave function is then used to evaluate , through the sqm algebra , the wave function for the excited states by using equation ( 9 ) ; the first excited state is given by [ psi2 ] _",
    "1^(1)(y ) -2 ( e^-(y - y_eq)-+1 ) exp ( -e^-(y - y_eq ) -y(- 32 ) ) and the second excited state is given by [ psi3 ] _",
    "2^(1)(y ) & ( 4 ^ 2 e^-2(y - y_eq ) -8 ^ 2 e^-2(y - y_eq ) + 12e^-(y - y_eq)-+4 ^ 2 - 14 + 12 ) .",
    "+ & exp ( -e^-(y - y_eq ) -y(- 52 ) ) .the wave functions given in ( [ psi1 ] ) , ( [ psi2 ] ) and ( [ psi3 ] ) are obtained to the exact system , non - confined or with no hydrogen bond .",
    "we refer to them as @xmath22 . for the confined system a potential barrier",
    "is introduced meaning that the wave functions must be zero outside the barrier .",
    "as the system is no longer exact , it is necessary to use an approximative method , which we choose to be the variational method .",
    "thus , based on previous results , @xcite and @xcite , the eigenfunctions are multiplied by the term @xmath23 , i.e. , the wave functions become zero at the edges of the confinement region . for the ground state , this approach is equivalent to introduce two additional terms in the superpotential @xmath24 , which corresponds to an infinite barrier in the confinement border , @xmath25 .    adopting this procedure ,",
    "the wave functions are defined for the region of space in which we are interested and , consequently , the probability of finding the hydrogen outside the confinement region must be zero . thus , the trial wave functions to be used in the variational method are given by [ psi - confined ] _",
    "n^(1)_(confined ) _ ( non - confined ) .(y_max - y)(y - y_min ) and we will only need the cases of @xmath26 .",
    "the energies for the confined case are obtained by solving [ energylevels - confined ] e_n = _ y_min^y_max_n^ * h_m _ n dy where @xmath27 is the hamiltonian of the system given by equation ( [ morse - hamiltonian ] ) and @xmath28 are the trial wave functions given by equation ( [ psi - confined ] ) , where @xmath22 are given by ( [ psi1 ] ) , ( [ psi2 ] ) and ( [ psi3 ] ) .",

    "in all the cases mentioned the distortion in the spectrum when the bond is formed is considerable and measurable , and is easily distinguished from the non - confined case , with no hydrogen bond .",
    "this shift occurs because the hydrogen bond imposes a barrier to the hydrogen and prevents it from having freedom in its oscillatory motion .",
    "quantitative results obtained for the vibrational transitions of the groups mentioned agree with the experimental results reported in the literature , reenforcing the applicability of the proposal and the reliability of this quantum mechanical methodology .",
