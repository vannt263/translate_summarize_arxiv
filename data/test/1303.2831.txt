    "@xmath7he@xmath8 is a metastable three - body system consisting of one electron in the ground state , the helium nucleus and one antiproton  @xcite .",
    "exotic _ atom can be created whenever an antiproton in the vicinity of a helium atom is slowed down to its ionization energy of @xmath924.6  ev or below .",
    "the antiproton can eject one of the two electrons from the ground state and replace it .",
    "the antiproton is captured and , due to its high mass , most likely to be in states with high angular momentum and with principal quantum number @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the reduced mass of the system , while the electron remains in the ground state .",
    "therefore , these newly - formed atoms occupy circular states with @xmath12 close to @xmath13 , where @xmath12 is the angular momentum quantum number .",
    "a majority of 97% of these exotic atoms find themselves in states dominated by auger decay . due to the auger excitation of the electron they ionize within a few nanoseconds after formation .",
    "the remaining 3% of antiprotonic helium atoms remain in metastable , radiative decay - dominated states .",
    "these states are relatively long lived , having a lifetime of about 1 - 2  @xmath14s  a time window that can be used to do laser and microwave spectroscopy measurements  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of magnetic moments between electron , antiproton and helium nucleus gives rise to a splitting of the @xmath15he@xmath8 energy levels .",
    "the coupling of the electron spin @xmath16 and the orbital angular momentum of the antiproton @xmath17 leads to the primary splitting of the state into a doublet structure , referred to as _ hyperfine ( hf ) splitting_. the angular momentum @xmath18 defines the two substates with quantum numbers @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the non - zero spin of the @xmath21he nucleus causes a further , so - called _ super - hyperfine ( shf ) splitting _ , which can be characterized by the angular momentum @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the spin of the helium nucleus .",
    "this results in four shf substates . at last",
    ", the spin - orbit interaction of the antiproton orbital angular momentum and antiproton spin @xmath24 in combination with the contact spin - spin and the tensor spin - spin interactions between the particles result in a further splitting of the shf substates into eight substates which we call _ super - super - hyperfine ( sshf ) splitting_. this octuplet structure can be described by the angular momentum @xmath25 . even though the magnetic moment of the antiproton is larger than that of the @xmath21he nucleus ,",
    "the former has a smaller overlap with the electron cloud .",
    "therefore it creates a smaller splitting . the complete hyperfine structure for @xmath15he@xmath8",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : he3_lmwl ] .",
    "the interest in @xmath26he@xmath27 arises from an additional contribution to the hyperfine structure caused by the coupling of the nuclear spin to the antiproton orbital momentum with respect to @xmath28he@xmath27  @xcite .",
    "such a measurement would allow a more rigorous test of qed theory .",
    "the accurate knowledge of the hyperfine structure of antiprotonic helium is essential for the calculation of the laser transition energies at the level of ppb accuracy needed for comparison to laser spectroscopy experiments and the extraction of the antiproton - to - electron mass ratio @xcite .",
    "an experimental verification of the hfs splitting in @xmath26he@xmath27 is therefore of great importance .",
    "the calculations of the hyperfine structure were developed by two different groups  @xcite .",
    "this series of experiments , studying the @xmath1 state , was the first attempt to measure the microwave transition frequencies between hyperfine substates of @xmath26he@xmath27 .",
    "transitions between the sshf states were induced by a magnetic field oscillating in the microwave frequency range . due to technical limitations of the microwave input power ,",
    "only the transitions which flip the spin of the electron could be measured .",
    "there are four such `` allowed '' sshf transitions for the @xmath1 state of @xmath26he@xmath27 two of which we investigated with the present work : @xmath29",
    "the first observation of a hyperfine structure in antiprotonic helium was achieved in a laser scan of the @xmath30 transitions in @xmath28he@xmath27 @xcite . due to the limited precision achievable in a laser scan , a _ laser - microwave - laser method _",
    "[ fig : he3_lmwl ] ) was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is based on a three - step process involving laser and microwave stimulated resonance transitions .",
    "after antiprotonic helium is formed , the atoms in the hyperfine substates are all equally populated .",
    "therefore at first a population asymmetry between the sshf substates of the measured radiative decay state @xmath31 needs to be created .",
    "this depopulation is induced by a short laser pulse which transfers the majority of antiprotons from one of the hf states of the radiative decay - dominated , metastable parent state to an auger decay - dominated , short - lived daughter state . in this experiment",
    "the @xmath32 transition is used .",
    "the bandwidth of the laser ( 100  mhz ) and doppler broadening at 6 k ( 300  mhz ) are small enough compared to the difference of @xmath33  ghz so that the @xmath34 transition is not affected and a population asymmetry can be achieved .",
    "the antiprotons in the short - lived state annihilate within a few nanoseconds . in the next step , a microwave frequency pulse tuned around the transition frequency between two sshf substates of the metastable state",
    "is applied .",
    "if the microwave field is on resonance with one of these transitions , it will cause a population transfer and thus partial refilling of one of the previously depopulated states .",
    "a second laser pulse will then again cause depopulation of the same hf substate and subsequently auger decay of the transferred atoms and annihilation of the antiprotons in the nucleus will occur .",
    "the number of annihilations after the second laser pulse will be the larger the more antiprotons were transferred by the microwave pulse .    when the antiprotons first enter the helium gas , a large annihilation peak (  prompt peak  ) is caused by the majority of formed @xmath35 atoms which find themselves in auger decay - dominated states and annihilate within picoseconds after formation . at later times",
    ", this peak exhibits an exponential tail due to @xmath35 atoms in the metastable states cascading more slowly towards the nucleus .",
    "this constitutes the background for the laser - induced annihilation signals .",
    "the daughter state has a very short lifetime of @xmath910  ns and thus the population transfer is indicated by a sharp annihilation peak against the background during the two laser pulses .",
    "the area under these peaks is proportional to the population transferred to this short - lived state .",
    "this spectrum , with the two laser - induced peaks super - imposed on the exponential tail  as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : adats ]  is called _ analogue delayed annihilation time spectrum _ or adats .",
    "since the intensity of the antiproton pulse fluctuates from shot to shot , the peaks must be normalised by the total intensity of the pulse ( total ) .",
    "this ratio is referred to as _ peak - to - total_. the peak - to - total ( ptt ) corresponds to the ratio of the peak area ( @xmath36 or @xmath37 ) to the total area under the full spectrum .",
    "if the second laser annihilation peak is further normalised to the first one , the total cancels out .",
    "the frequencies of the two sshf transitions can now be obtained as distinct lines by plotting @xmath38 as a function of the microwave frequency .",
    "the ratio @xmath38 is largely independent of intensity and position fluctuations of the antiproton beam .",
    "the intensity of the transition lines is subject to the time delay between the two laser pulses and thus also to collisional relaxation processes  @xcite .",
    "this means that , once the first laser has caused depopulation , the system will start to relax through spin exchanging collisions between antiprotonic helium atoms and regular helium atoms .",
    "refilling from higher - lying states also contributes to the equalization of the hyperfine substate populations . in general , a short delay @xmath39 is preferable because the signal height will decrease for longer laser delay times as a result of the exponential decay of the metastable state populations .",
    "however , the linewidth of the rf transition will increase if the delay is too short .",
    "further , far higher rf power will be required to complete one spin - flip .",
    "if the delay is too long , the collisional relaxation of the system would already have eliminated any asymmetry between the two states caused by the first laser pulse .",
    "the signal would be too low to be observed .",
    "the two pulsed lasers were fixed to a wavelength of 723.877  nm , with a pulse length of 8 - 12  ns , to induce the @xmath40 laser transition between the @xmath1 and the @xmath41 state .",
    "the pulse length should be comparable to or longer than the auger lifetime of the short - lived state .",
    "generally spoken , the longer the laser pulse the larger the achieved depopulation and thus the resulting annihilation signal .",
    "the depopulation also depends on the laser pulse energy .",
    "it is important to find the appropriate laser fluence where the power is saturated and therefore the laser depletion efficiency is optimized in order to avoid power broadened resonance lines and as a consequence partial depopulation of the other hf transition line f@xmath42 . for this experiment",
    "a pulse - amplified continuous - wave laser system with a narrow linewidth of about 100  mhz was used  @xcite .",
    "the laser fluence was in the range of 20 - 40  mj@xmath43@xmath44 , the laser waist @xmath95  mm , leading to a depletion efficieny of about 90%  based on numerical simulations of the laser transition processes  @xcite .",
    "there are several limitations to the choice of the measured state , such as availability of a laser source in the required frequency range or the splitting of the transitions between the hf states of the daughter and the parent state .",
    "the laser transition between the @xmath1 and the @xmath41 state was chosen because it is easily stimulated and the primary population is large , thus leading to a large signal .",
    "the captured fraction of antiprotons in the measured metastable state @xmath1 is ( 3 - 4)@xmath45  @xcite .",
    "the antiprotons for the experiment are provided by the ad ( antiproton decelerator ) at cern  @xcite , with a pulsed beam of ( 1 - 3)@xmath46 antiprotons at an energy of 5.3  mev , a pulse length of 100 - 300 ns , and a repetition interval of about 100  s. the particles are stopped in a helium gas target , with a gas pressure of 250  mbar , cooled down to a temperature of about 6  k. this target is built as a cylindrical chamber whose axis is parallel to the beam direction and which is designed to act also as a microwave cavity resonating in the tm@xmath47 mode .",
    "the faces of the cylindrical cavity have a 25 @xmath14 m thick titanium window for the antiproton beam and a 4 mm thick fused silica window for the laser beam to enter @xcite , and are equipped with meshes to contain the microwaves .    in order to measure the annihilation decay products two",
    "cherenkov counters are mounted around the target volume , connected to photomultipliers ( cf .",
    "[ fig : newcryostat ] ) .",
    "they are gated off during the initial @xmath7 pulse arrival  @xcite in order to count only the photons arriving from the induced annihilations . a vector network analyzer ( vna , rhode & schwarz zvb20 ) synthesizes the microwave pulse that is further amplified by a travelling wave tube amplifier ( twta , tmd ptc6358 ) from where a waveguide system transmits the pulse of @xmath920  @xmath14s length to the cavity .",
    "the waveguide is over - coupled to the cavity resulting in a low quality factor of @xmath48 .",
    "the frequency of the microwave radiation is tuned by changing the frequency of the vna , increasing the input power off - resonance so to keep the power inside the cavity constant .",
    "the microwave power inside the cavity is measured by a pickup antenna and a calibrated diode ( agilent 8474b ) .",
    "input powers of maximum 40 w were used to achieve a constant power of 7.5 w inside the cavity . a detailed discussion on the microwave apparatus , including design , simulation , construction and calibration , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a cryostat with compressor - based cooling system was built to cool the experimental apparatus without abundant use of coolants , to allow an efficient cooling procedure and thus little loss of measurement time .",
    "the microwave cavity is filled with helium gas and cooled down directly to about 6  k by mounting it on a coldhead  @xcite . by use of additional degrader foils ( polymide film foils   of about 70  @xmath14 m thickness ) the antiprotons",
    "could be stopped in the center of a cavity in a volume of about 1  @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "in preparation for the actual investigation of the hyperfine substructure , via microwave resonance , several studies are required to optimize the parameters such as laser power , laser resonance frequency , laser delay time and microwave power .",
    "the frequency and the splitting of the two resonance lines @xmath40 and @xmath49 are determined by scanning our laser system over a range of about 5  ghz centered around the two transition frequencies .",
    "the laser power was adjusted to observe a clear splitting of the two transition lines to ensure that only one of the two hyperfine levels of the @xmath1 state is depopulated by laser stimulation .",
    "the measurements were all performed at a target pressure of 250  mbar and a delay time of @xmath50  ns between the two lasers pulses .",
    "due to limited measurement time , only one target density was used .",
    "however , previous studies in @xmath51he@xmath8 @xcite as well as calculations suggest that the target density should have no effect on the resonance line shape , width or amplitude of the resonance lines  @xcite at the level of the precision of this experiment .",
    "it is important to choose the correct microwave power in order for the electron to undergo one electron spin - flip  @xcite , i.e. to achieve a @xmath52-pulse that results in the highest signal . for this",
    "the ptt ratio is measured at the predicted resonance frequency for several power values in the range between 0 and 20 watts microwave power inside the cavity , as determined by the pick - up antenna .",
    "the points measured at 0  w were recorded on resonance .",
    "points were also taken sufficiently off resonance ( a few hundred megahertz away ) but at some non - zero power .",
    "off resonance , the microwave pulse should have no effect on the atoms , thus confirming that the observed signal is real and not caused by some kind of fluctuations .",
    "[ fig : mwpowscan ] illustrates such a scan . according to these data ,",
    "a @xmath52-pulse is completed at the first power maximum of about 7.5  w. the microwave power study is performed for a laser delay of 350  ns .",
    "figure  [ fig : mwpow ] displays the frequency dependence of the microwave power over the scan range in the case of the two 11  ghz transitions  with an average drift of 10 - 13% over the recorded spectrum . despite thorough calibration of the system",
    ", there appears to be a linear tendency of the power over the frequency range .",
    "this behavior could potentially lead to a distortion of the line shape and an increase of errors .",
    "however , from fig .  [",
    "fig : mwpowscan ] can be seen that the peak - to - total ratio does not change considerably within the error between a microwave power of 7.5  w and 10  w. therefore , it is not expected that this linear tendency of the power over the frequency range has a significant effect on the error and the fit of the transitions lines .",
    "two of the four allowed sshf resonance transitions in @xmath26he@xmath27 could be observed . in the analysis all recorded data , including the previously published data of 2010 @xcite and new ones obtained in 2011 were taken into account .",
