    "the prevalence of dusty , infrared luminous galaxies at early times tests our theories about early galaxy formation and the production of metals . semi - analytic models predict very small numbers of submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) at extreme redshifts ( @xmath0 , e.g.  baugh et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the best observational constraints on the redshift distribution of smgs are consistent with this ( chapman et al .  2005 ; swinbank et al .",
    "much attention has been given to recent studies which have spectroscopically confirmed a small number of smgs at @xmath0 ( capak et al .",
    "2008 ; coppin et al .  2009 ; daddi et al .  2009ab ; knudsen et al .",
    "2010 ) ; however , these sources are still only a small fraction of the submillimeter population .",
    "small number statistics and cosmic variance in current submillimeter surveys prohibit an accurate measure of the space density of the most distant smgs .",
    "the question of the prominence of the high redshift tail of dusty smgs can be addressed with imminent submillimeter wide area surveys such as those with the _ herschel space observatory _ ( pilbratt 2001 ) , the scuba-2 camera on the jcmt ( holland et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the aztec camera on the large millimeter telescope ( lmt , wilson et al .",
    "the _ herschel space observatory _ is currently collecting data from 70500@xmath6 m over wide survey fields . with an aperture of 3.5@xmath9 m , _ herschel _",
    "is only sensitive to ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , l@xmath10 ) above @xmath11 at 250500@xmath6 m before it reaches the confusion limit .",
    "one advantage of spire surveys is the simultaneous observations at three wavelengths ; 250 , 350 and 500@xmath6 m , which samples the peak of the far - ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) due to dust emission in high redshift galaxies . with prior knowledge of the dust properties which describe the shape of the sed",
    ", the position of the far - ir peak is sensitive to the redshift of the galaxy .    in this paper , we discuss the power and limitations of using the far - ir peak as a redshift indicator in submillimeter surveys .",
    "we apply this technique to the current blast survey of ecdfs and place an upper limit on the number density of 500@xmath6m - selected smgs at @xmath0 .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a standard cosmology with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the 1.6@xmath15 m bump in the near - infrared sed of galaxies arises due to a minimum in the h@xmath16 opacity in the spectra of cool stars .",
    "this bump has been used in extragalactic _",
    "spitzer_/irac surveys to identify sources in a specific redshift range ( e.g.  wright et al .",
    "1994 , sawicki 2002 , farrah et al .",
    "2008 ) . a similar , but factor of @xmath17 broader , peak exists in the sed of galaxies at far - ir wavelengths which is caused by the integrated thermal emission from dust of different temperatures .",
    "this sed is often parameterized as a blackbody distribution of a particular far - infrared color temperature ( t@xmath18 ) with an additional term to account for the dust emissivity .",
    "the choice of emissivity affects the derived color temperature . ]",
    "( e.g.  blain et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the challenge with using the far - ir bump as a redshift indicator is that the average dust temperature and the redshift are degenerate ( e.g.  blain 1999 ; blain , barnard & chapman 2003 ) .",
    "wien s displacement law tells us that the wavelength of the peak of a blackbody scales with the dust temperature . coupling this with the displacement of the peak due to redshift we find that the observed wavelength of the far - ir peak depends linearly on both the redshift and the inverse of the dust temperature : @xmath19 .",
    "the most luminous galaxies in the local universe show far - infrared color temperatures that peak at @xmath2040@xmath9k although there is a significant scatter in luminosity - temperature parameter space ( e.g.  dunne et al . 2000 ) . for a reasonable range of dust temperatures for ulirgs",
    ", sources that peak at 500@xmath6 m can be found anywhere between @xmath216 . this is a very large range in redshift and without prior information about the dust temperature it is difficult to further constrain the redshift with the spire data alone .",
    "in order to test this technique on observations we use the data from the blast survey of ecdfs ( devlin et al .  2009 ) . blast has the same three detectors as _ herschel_/spire but with beam sizes that are twice as big ; 36 , 42 , 60 arcsecs fwhm at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath6 m respectively ( marsden et al .  2009 ) .",
    "we use the publicly released blast maps and the matched filter catalogs ( chapin et al .",
    "these matched filter catalogs do a much better job at de - blending adjacent sources and result in higher signal - to - noise ratios than previous blast catalogs ( see chapin et al .",
    "2010 for further details ) .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the central 0.47@xmath9deg@xmath22 of the blast image where @xmath23mjy at 500@xmath6 m .",
    "we have conservatively added the confusion noise in quadrature with the instrument noise ( @xmath24 ) for all analysis in this paper .",
    "we only consider detections if they are @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) . in this central region",
    "there are 23 galaxies robustly detected at @xmath27 m with @xmath28mjy .",
    "we match the 500@xmath6m - selected galaxies to the matched filter catalogs at 250@xmath6 m and 350@xmath6 m ; we consider any @xmath25 detection within a radius of 60 arcsecs to be the counterpart to the 500@xmath6 m emission . for sources which are undetected at these other wavelengths we set upper limits on the 350 and 250@xmath6 m fluxes from the 90% completeness limits of the survey ( chapin et al .",
    "2010 ) which is equivalent to @xmath29 .    of these 23 500@xmath6m - selected galaxies , 8",
    "have @xmath2 indicating that the dust sed peaks at or near 500@xmath6 m  we refer to these galaxies as 500@xmath6 m ` peakers ' ( although their peak may be at even longer wavelengths ) .",
    "interestingly , none of these 500@xmath6 m peakers ( detected at @xmath25 ) are detected above @xmath30 at 250 and 350@xmath6 m .",
    "we inspected all of these candidates by hand in the blast images to make sure they are not obviously blended .",
    "we have not attempted to correct for flux boosting ( e.g.  coppin et al .",
    "2006 ) in this analysis but , since we are not interested in the absolute fluxes and only the relative colors , this is less of a concern .",
    "in addition by considering only higher signal - to - noise ratio sources we ensure that this effect is minimal . in order to assess how photometric uncertainties ( from both confusion and instrument noise ) affect",
    "the number of 500@xmath6 m peakers identified , we ran a monte carlo simulation to randomly sample the fluxes of each of the 23 sources from a gaussian distribution @xmath31 .",
    "we find that photometric uncertainties can vary the number of sources with @xmath2 by 2 .",
    "thus our final number of 500@xmath6 m peakers is @xmath1 .",
    "these 8 high redshift candidates are listed in table 1 along with their fluxes and fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] shows an example sed for one source .",
    "five of these 500@xmath6 m peakers are within the ecdfs field and one is within the smaller goods - s region ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the source within goods - s is associated ( 6 arcsecs away ) from an aztec 1.1@xmath9 mm detected source ( gs11 , scott et al .",
    "2010 ) ; however , flux boosting in the blast bands prohibit a detailed comparison .    knowing that a source peaks at ( or near ) 500@xmath6 m does not provide a definitive redshift due to the degeneracy between redshift and temperature ( e.g.  fig .  [",
    "fig : tdust ] ) .",
    "if we conservatively assume that all 500@xmath6 m peakers are at @xmath0 we can obtain an upper limit on the number density of @xmath0 galaxies predicted in _",
    "herschel _ spire surveys . based on our analysis of the blast data , the number density of galaxies ( with s@xmath7mjy ) which peak at 500@xmath6 m is @xmath3deg@xmath4 .",

    ", we find that only @xmath36% have @xmath35 .",
    "these two factors roughly cancel each other and we are left with a constraint on the number density of @xmath0 sources ( with s@xmath7mjy ) of @xmath37deg@xmath4 .    the above limit on the number density of @xmath0 smgs ambitiously assumes a flat redshift distribution . if instead we assume the observed redshift distribution of smgs ( @xmath38 , chapman et al .  2005 ;",
    "pope et al .  2006 ) , we find only 10% of the 500@xmath6 m peakers at @xmath0 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tdust ] ) which brings the number density estimate down to @xmath39deg@xmath4 . based on our analysis of the blast data ,",
    "we conclude that the number density of s@xmath7mjy sources at @xmath0 is @xmath37deg@xmath4 and could be as low as @xmath39deg@xmath4 .    with some assumptions about the dust temperature distribution",
    ", we have shown that the submillimeter color selection , @xmath2 is a plausible way to identify samples containing the highest redshift smgs selected at these wavelengths ( albeit these samples contain contamination from lower redshift objects ) . without further multi - wavelength data ,",
    "it is impossible to tell individually which of the 8 candidates are at @xmath0 , and which are just peaking at 500@xmath6 m because they have cooler dust temperatures .",
    "one way to test the reality of these high redshift candidates is to further constrain their seds with data at longer submm wavelengths such as those from the 870@xmath6 m laboca survey of ecdfs ( weiss et al .",
    "in order to do a robust comparison between the laboca and blast fluxes , a correction for flux boosting needs to be applied to both surveys using the same method ( e.g.  coppin et al .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper but should be possible with full access to the signal and noise maps from both surveys .",
    "another potential way to break the degeneracy between redshift and temperature for these candidates is with the radio and/or far - ir ( e.g.  @xmath40 m ) flux ; we discuss this further in the next section .",
    "photometry from 250500@xmath6 m alone can provide an accurate measure of @xmath41 .",

    "is known to correlate well with the infrared emission in the local universe ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "because of this radio - infrared correlation , radio data is often used to help identify counterparts to smgs ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "2002 ) , and to constrain the redshift ( e.g.  carilli & yun 1999 ; hughes et al .  2002 ; aretxaga et al .",

    "[ fig : sim ] .",
    "here we assume the average value and scatter in the @xmath43 parameter from fitting local galaxies ( yun , reddy & condon 2001 )",
    ". the radio flux is not degenerate with the redshift ; however , unfortunately , the large scatter in the local radio - ir correlation provides fairly loose constraints on the redshift of individual objects from the radio flux .",
    "nevertheless , a large fraction of the bright smgs detected with spire will be above the flux limits of deep ( @xmath44jy ) 1.4 ghz radio surveys . with large statistical samples ,",
    "the redshift distribution inferred from including radio observations should be robust , assuming the radio - ir correlation holds out to high redshift .",
    "below @xmath45 m rest - frame , the sed of galaxies is no longer dominated by the single temperature modified blackbody but instead by warmer dust components .",
