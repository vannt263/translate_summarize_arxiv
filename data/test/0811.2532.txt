    "presto uses a similar matched filtering algorithm to the one described below , but a different rfi excision scheme and trial dm list .",
    "we dedisperse raw data with 1272 trial dms in the range @xmath36  pc  @xmath37 . in order to find individual pulses from intermittent sources we operate on dedispersed time series with two time domain algorithms : matched filtering , which has been the standard in single pulse searching so far , and a friends - of - friends algorithm . after single pulse candidates",
    "have been identified we use a stacking method in the time - frequency plane to verify that the pulses are dispersed and the sweep observed across frequencies follows the dispersion relation , as expected for non - terrestrial sources .",
    "certain types of terrestrial signals , e.g. swept - frequency radars , have pulses whose appearance in the time - frequency plane may approximate dispersion by ionized gas , but on closer inspection such pulses generally deviate significantly from the cold plasma dispersion relation .      matched filtering detection of broadened pulses relies on the convolution of a pulse template with the dedispersed time series .",
    "ideally , a pulse template would consist of one or several superimposed gaussian templates , reflecting the diversity of pulsar pulse profiles , some of which exhibit multiple peaks .",
    "in addition , multipath propagation due to scattering adds an exponential tail to the pulse profile .",
    "we approximate true matched filtering by smoothing the time series by adding up to @xmath38 neighboring samples , where @xmath39 , and selecting events above a threshold after each smoothing iteration .",
    "the smoothing is done in pairs of samples at each @xmath40-stage , so that the resulting template is a boxcar of length @xmath38 samples ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sampling time used in palfa observations is 64  @xmath8s and therefore our matched filtering search is most sensitive to pulse widths of 64  @xmath8s to 8.2  ms .",
    "this search strategy is not optimal for single pulses from heavily scattered pulsars because the templates are symmetric , while the scattered pulse shape with an exponential tail is not , and significantly scattered pulses can be wider than @xmath41  ms .",
    "two issues make a complement to matched filtering necessary .",
    "the pulse templates described above have discrete widths of @xmath42 samples by algorithm design and there is decreased sensitivity to pulses with widths that are significantly different .",
    "in addition , the matched filter search output may be dominated by bright , wide pulses from radio frequency interference ( rfi ) . in that case ,",
    "a single rfi burst is detected as an overwhelming number of individual events instead of a single event .",
    "the cluster algorithm is similar to the friends - of - friends search algorithm used to find galaxies in optical images ( @xcite ) , and complements matched filtering by not restricting the width of expected pulse detections .",
    "the dedispersed time series is processed sequentially .",
    "each event above a threshold which is found is designated as the first of a cluster .",
    "a cluster of events is augmented by broadening it to include any adjacent samples above a threshold .",
    "gaps of @xmath43 samples are allowed within a cluster , and palfa data is processed with @xmath44 .",
    "the brightest sample of a cluster is recorded as the event amplitude , and the total number of samples in the cluster as its width .",
    "this approach is less sensitive to weak , narrow pulses but results in significantly fewer spurious events due to rfi .    a limiting factor for the largest pulse width detectable by both the matched filtering and friends - of - friends search algorithms is the fact that data are analysed in blocks much shorter than the complete time series length .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of a block are used for thresholding events found within the block .",
    "this approach minimizes the effect of baseline variations with time scales much longer than typical pulsar pulse widths of a few to a few tens of ms .",
    "the disadvantage is that only pulses with @xmath45 can be detected . in processing palfa data ,",
    "we use blocks of length @xmath46s  @xmath47  s. according to the ne2001 model of ionized gas in the galaxy ( @xcite ) , a scattering broadening time of that magnitude in the inner - galaxy part of the palfa survey corresponds to @xmath48  pc  @xmath37 and a maximum search distance well outside of the milky way for most directions we survey .",
    "however , lines of sight intersecting hii regions can result in large dispersion measures and scattering times and are therefore selected against . any intergalactic scattering that broadens pulses beyond about 0.1",

    "we simulated this effect by generating a time - frequency plane of gaussian noise , dedispersing it , and selecting events above threshold from the resulting time series .",
    "we extracted chunks from the fake time - frequency plane centered on each event and stacked them , thus reproducing the procedure used on real data .    selecting events with signal - to - noise above a threshold @xmath55 in the dedispersed time series yields a biased set of noise - only samples in the time - frequency plane . on the other hand ,",
    "when stacking dynamic spectra , points in the stacked dynamic spectrum must have a minimum signal - to - noise @xmath56 for a dispersion sweep to be discernible by eye .",

    ". therefore if @xmath64 data chunks are added there will be a spurious , dispersed pulse in the resulting stacked dynamic spectrum even if the chunks contain only noise .",
    "since the noise decorrelates over @xmath65 samples , the pulse will have a width on the order of @xmath66s . to avoid the induced spurious - event effect ,",

    "palfa survey data are dedispersed with trial dispersion measures of @xmath36  pc  @xmath37 .",
    "rfi pulse intensity typically peaks at @xmath71  pc  @xmath37 , and incidental low - intensity pulses whose s / n peaks at dm = 0  pc  @xmath37 tend to be smeared below the detection threshold for dedispersed time series with trial @xmath72  pc  @xmath37 .",

    "the more radar pulses are present , the better the performance of this technique because the radar peak in the dft is more prominent and the pulses arrival times are determined more precisely .",
    "however , if only a couple of strong radar pulses are present within the typical 268  s palfa integration time , they may be bright enough to dominate event statistics , yet the dft method does not excise non - periodic incidental rfi .",
    "consequently , after applying the dft - based method we use an additional rfi filter that handles aperiodic cases .",
    "the second filter uses the number and proximity of beams in which an event is detected in order to determine if it is due to rfi . again",
    "events for trial @xmath77  pc  @xmath37 from each beam are binned in time . after detecting peaks indicating an excess of events for",

    "most pulsars detected blindly via a single pulse search appear in one beam or two adjacent beams , and very bright pulsars may be detected in three or four adjacent beams .",
    "we set the excision penalty threshold just below the value corresponding to the latter configurations and excise events accordingly .",
    "this method complements the dft cleaning scheme and effectively excises sparse radar blasts as well as non - periodic rfi detected in multiple beams .",
    "the application of the two excision algorithms makes a marked difference in the final single pulse search output for pointings contaminated with rfi ( fig .",

    "the figure shows some false positives , for example a clump of pulsar pulses in beam 4 around @xmath81  s are excised due to low - level rfi at low dms occurring in non - adjacent beams in the same 0.1  s time bins as the pulses .",
    "lowering the threshold according to which an excess of events is defined and time bins are marked for excision reduces false positives but also diminishes the effectiveness of rfi excision . while tens of pulses are detected within 134  s from the bright pulsar b2020 + 28 ( fig .",

    "considering that bright pulsars are more likely to be seen by both the fft and sp search , and they are also more likely to have already been found by previous , less sensitive surveys , this indicates that palfa is probing deeper and finding pulsars that are farther away or less bright than the known objects in the same region of the galactic plane .",
    "single pulse searches have not been routinely carried out on survey data in the past , with the exception of @xcite , @xcite , who discovered psr  j1918 + 08 via a single pulse search , and @xcite , who found 11 rrats .",
    "therefore , the proportion of single - pulse - only detections is higher for the palfa discoveries than the known pulsars .",
    "the five known pulsars detected only by single pulse search are known steady emitters which were seen away from the beam center and therefore with reduced sensitivity .",
    "the sample of palfa single pulse discoveries (   [ section_objects ] ) includes one object which has not been detected again despite reobservations ( j1928 + 15 ) , two sources detectable in re - observations through their time - averaged emission ( psr  j0628 + 09 and psr  j1909 + 06 ) , and four long - period objects , one of which has the smallest known duty cycle for any radio pulsar ( psr  j0627 + 16 ) .    among the 11 parkes rrats ,",

    "have periods greater than 2  s. in this section we discuss selection effects which may account for some of the observational characteristics of intermittent sources . characteristics of this population which remain unexplained by observational biases may indicate underlying intrinsic differences between these objects and conventional radio pulsars .",
    "they may belong to a genuinely intermittent and physically different class of neutron stars .",
    "we can define a general model for observed signal intensity in terms of the time and frequency - dependent flux density @xmath82 as i(t , ) = g_t(t , ) g_iss(t , ) s_i(t , ) + n(t , ) + rfi(t , ) , where @xmath83 is the telescope gain , @xmath84 is the variation factor due to interstellar scintillation , @xmath85 is radiometer noise , and @xmath86 is the contribution from terrestrial radio frequency interference .    variations in telescope gain across the beams of the multi - beam receiver or within the power pattern of a single beam impact the detectability of a pulsar as either a single pulse or periodic source . as shown by the reobservations of psr  j0627 + 16 , psr  j1909 + 06 , psr  j0848@xmath143 and psr  j1754@xmath130 , classifying a source as intermittent may be due to insufficient sensitivity to detect its periodic emission during the discovery observation .",

    "the pulsar is also detected in the first sidelobe of an adjacent beam , in which case only the brightest pulses are above the detection threshold and only the high - intensity tail of the distribution is visible .",
    "thus an off - axis detection of a steadily emitting pulsar may misrepresent it as an intermittent source .",
    "a different set of effects which affect detectability in single pulse vs. periodic search is due to intervening ionized gas .",
    "turbulence in the ionized interstellar gas and the motion of the pulsar with respect to the gas introduce phase modulations in the pulsar emission which cause the observed intensity to change over time and frequency . in general , the scintillation gain factor has contributions from both diffractive ( diss ) and refractive ( riss ) interstellar scintillation , such that @xmath87 @xcite .",

    "the scintillation bandwidth @xmath91 and scattering timescale @xmath92 are related through @xmath93 . an empirical fit from @xcite for @xmath23 in ghz and @xmath92 in ms gives an estimate for @xmath92 based on dm : _ s = -6.46 + 0.154  dm + 1.07 (  dm)^2 - 3.86  _ f _ [ eqn_taus ] , but there is significant scatter about this relationship . when the scintillation bandwidth and time scale are small , averaging over the observation time and bandwidth can quench diss .    for refractive scintillation , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "unlike for diss , the time scale of riss increases with distance and therefore it can become very long for distant pulsars with relatively high dms . both riss and diss can either help or hinder pulsar detection due to the time - variable constructive or destructive interference of wave fronts they cause . for a single - pass survey",
    ", this means that some weak pulsars may be detected because they are modulated above the detection threshold , and some pulsars that are otherwise bright enough may be missed because of scintillation modulation .",

    "the palfa survey can place limits on the rate and amplitude distribution of radio transients that are shorter than about 1 second in duration .",

    "other possibilities are discussed in @xcite .    motivated by these considerations , we discuss the constraints that can be made on transient events from palfa survey data obtained to date .",
    "first , we note that most  but not all  of the aperiodic events detected to date in palfa data ( as reported in   [ section_objects ] ) and in the parkes multibeam survey by @xcite , appear to be periodic when they are reobserved sufficiently to establish a periodicity .",
    "additionally , _ all _ events detected so far in both surveys have dispersion measures that can be accounted for by ionized gas in the galaxy ( using the ne2001 model ) , suggesting that the emitting sources are closely related to the standard galactic pulsar population . by constrast",

    "in addition to detecting radio sources on axis in data streams from each of the seven beams of the alfa system , it is possible to detect strong events off axis with low but non - zero sensitivity over almost the entire hemisphere centered on the zenith .",
    "consequently , it is possible to detect relatively low - rate but very bright transients off axis as well as the much weaker but higher rate single pulses that we have detected in the on - axis parts of the beam pattern .    to establish that a given event is celestial in nature , we need to distinguish it from terrestrial interference . for on - axis events ,",
    "this classification process is aided by the directionality of the seven beams and the expectation that most real events are likely to be seen in three or fewer contiguous beams rather than in all seven beams .",
    "bright events may violate this expectation , however , because near - in sidelobes are fairly large ( c.f .",
    "figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "celestial and terrestrial radio signals can also enter the seven beams of the alfa receiver indirectly  far off the nominal pointing axis  through reflection and scattering off telescope support structures , as with any antenna .",
    "extremely bright signals ( celestial or terrestrial ) may be detected after scattering into one or more beams , and the effective gain is approximately that of an isotropic radiator with small gain for events incident far off axis from the pointing direction .",
    "for the arecibo telescope , which has an intricate support structure with many possible scattering surfaces , such wide - angle incidence is likely to provide multiple paths for radiation to enter the feed optics .",
    "radiation arriving along multiple paths will constructively and destructively interfere across alfa s focal plane , so that the event s strength will be nonuniform in the different data streams .    when radiation enters the telescope optics from wide angles , it is difficult to distinguish celestial from terrestrial signals based on the nominal pointing direction of the telescope and on whether they are detected in a single beam , a subset of beams , or all beams",
    ". conceivably , extremely bright events from a single radio source could be emitted at very rare intervals that would be detected when the telescope is pointed nominally at directions separated by tens of degrees ( but within the same hemisphere ) .",
    "such sources and events will be exceedingly difficult to disentangle from terrestrial rfi .",
    "of course the most powerful confirmation of a particular event is the detection of similar events in reobservations of the same sky position . for most of the events",
    "reported in   [ section_objects ] and by @xcite ,",
    "redetections have been made in this manner .",
    "they have also relied on establishing that their signatures in the frequency - time plane conform to what is expected .",
    "the simplest celestial signals are narrow pulses that show differential arrival times in accord with the cold - plasma dispersion law ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "celestial objects may also show the effects of multipath propagation through the interstellar medium ( ism ) either in the frequency structure that is produced in the spectra of nearby pulsars or in the asymmetric broadening of the pulses from more distant objects . for cases where spatial information associated with the nominal telescope pointing direction is insufficient to constrain the celestial nature of a particular event",
    ", we must rely especially on a detailed study of the event s structure in the time - frequency plane .",
    "indeed the time - frequency structure of the event discussed by @xcite was a key part of the argument for its classification as a celestial event .",
    "a given reflector and feed antenna have a net antenna power pattern with a main lobe and near - in sidelobes that is similar to an airy function with a main - lobe angular width @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the effective reflector diameter .",
    "the wide - angle part of the antenna pattern has far - out sidelobes that are independent of @xmath148 and have average gains @xmath149 , similar to that of an isotropic antenna .",
    "however peaks in the far - out sidelobe pattern can have gains significantly larger than @xmath150 , corresponding to special directions where scattering from the telescope support structure is especially efficient .",
    "for the arecibo telescope , we expect sidelobes to have the same general properties , with the caveat that support structures will introduce further complexity in the far - out sidelobe pattern that varies as the telescope is used to track a source .",
    "tracking a sky position is done by rotating the azimuth arm and moving the gregorian dome along the azimuth arm , thus changing the scattering geometry .",
    "we therefore expect the sidelobe structure to change significantly with azimuth and elevation of the targeted position on the sky .",
    "for the seven - beam alfa system , the main beams by design sample different parts of the sky , as do the near - in sidelobes . at wider angles , the power pattern of each feed overlaps the others but with considerable variation in gain from feed to feed .    to derive simple constraints on burst amplitudes and rates , we expand the gain for each feed into inner beam and wide - angle terms : g ( , ) = g_max p_n ( , ) + ( 1 - _ b ) , where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are polar and azimuthal angles , respectively ; @xmath153 is the power pattern for the main beam and near - in sidelobes ; @xmath154 is the main - beam efficiency , and @xmath155 is the average level of the far - out sidelobes .",

    "[ farout_palfa ] ]      a brief summary of our results is that ( a ) a small number of events has been detected from sources that are consistent with their membership in the radio pulsar population , but with a much greater deal of modulation in some cases ; ( b ) no very strong pulses have been identified in the far - out sidelobes of the arecibo telescope and ( c ) no bursts have been detected that are extragalactic in origin .",
    "here we compare our results with those of @xcite , who surveyed high - galactic - latitude regions that included the magellanic clouds and who discovered a single reported pulse , with amplitude 30  jy .",
    "they surveyed @xmath183  deg@xmath13 with a detection threshold @xmath184  mjy , about 100 times fainter than the detected pulse amplitude .",
    "to compare any two surveys , we initially assume a population of radio sources that is homogeneously distributed in euclidean space and we ignore propagation effects that might limit the detectability of bursts from distant sources . the number of events detected @xmath185 for a survey of duration @xmath186 that samples instantaneously a solid angle @xmath187 . for multibeam systems with @xmath188 pixels , @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the solid angle of a single beam .",
    "we assume events have the same peak luminosity and pulse width @xmath19 and are detectable to a distance @xmath15 .",
    "the ratio of number of detected events in two surveys with total observation times @xmath191 and @xmath192 , and bandwidths @xmath193 and @xmath194 is & = & ( ) ( ) ( ) ^3 + & = & ( ) ( ) ( ) ^3/2 ( ) ^3/4 .",
    "[ eqn_nbna ]    as pointed out by @xcite , the same survey that detected the 30-jy pulse should have yielded many more detections if the assumptions of a volume limited sample apply . using eq .",
    "[ eqn_nbna ] , the lone 30  jy pulse implies there should have been @xmath195 additional detections above a 100-times fainter threshold . in the 90  h of follow up observations ,",
    "there should have been @xmath196 additional detections .",
    "comparing the parkes and palfa surveys , a system - equivalent flux density of 4  jy , and 100 mhz bandwidth .",
    "for the parkes survey we use 13 beams of 14  arcmin diameter , 480  h , a threshold of 600 , @xmath197  jy , and 288  mhz bandwidth . ] , we estimate that the palfa survey should have identified @xmath198 pulses above threshold .",
    "the palfa survey s null result on extragalactic events is therefore in accord with lorimer et al.s non - detection of events weaker than the single strong event they reported .",
    "with the assumptions made , these results suggest that the non - detections of pulses weaker than the 30-jy pulse are inconsistent with the source population having a distribution that is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "there are caveats on these results related to the assumptions about the source population and to the possible role of propagation effects in limiting detectability .",
    "the minimum detectable flux density for the palfa survey is 30  mjy for a 5-ms pulse , implying that a pulse of 30  jy strength emitted at a distance @xmath199 is detectable to a distance @xmath15 given by @xmath200 .",
    "if the lone event detected by lorimer et al . is from a source at the attributed distance @xmath201  gpc ( based on assigning about half of the dm to the intergalactic medium ) , the palfa survey would detect fewer pulses than estimated above ( for constant luminosity ) because the universe is not old enough and from redshifting of the spectrum if it is steep in frequency .",
    "nonetheless , a cosmological population of constant - luminosity sources would extend to @xmath202 times the attributed distance , implying from the first form of eq .",
    "[ eqn_nbna ] that @xmath203 pulses should have been detected in the palfa survey , on average , while @xmath204 weaker pulses should have been seen in the discovery survey with parkes .",
    "the difference in yield under this alternative scaling results from the fact that the palfa survey can detect sources well beyond the cosmological population while the parkes survey is comparatively shallower ( by a factor of ten in flux density , i.e. 300 compared to 30  mjy ) , but covers a factor of 30 greater solid angle .",
    "consideration of a broad luminosity function does not alter these conclusions qualitatively .",
    "however , we would generally expect the pulse amplitude distribution to extend to _ lower _ flux densities ( from lower luminosities ) given that the sole reported event was much larger than the threshold and that , therefore , many more pulses are expected compared to the constant - luminosity assumption .",
    "pulse broadening from multipath propagation in either the ism or the intergalactic medium ( igm ) can also limit the numbers of events detected in a survey because the broadening increases with source distance .",
    "the maximum detectable distance is therefore diminished , as demonstrated for the ism in figure  [ fig : dmax_vs_lp ] .",
    "lorimer et al .",
    "argued that the strong frequency dependence of the width of the 30-jy pulse was consistent with multipath propagation through a turbulent , ionized igm .",
    "if so , sources from a greater distance would be less - easily detectable . in the simplest scattering geometries ,",
    "scattering conserves the area of the pulse , so matched filtering yields a test statistic with s / n @xmath205 when the pulse broadening time @xmath206 is much larger than the intrinsic pulse width ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 30-jy pulse therefore could have been broadened by an additional factor of @xmath207 and the s / n still would have been above threshold .",
    "the much longer pulses ( @xmath208  ms = 50  s ) would have been difficult if not impossible to identify in the time series owing to high - pass filtering used to mitigate baseline fluctuations .",
    "the high - pass filtering was explicit in the parkes multibeam data acquisition but is part of the post - processing in the palfa analysis .",
    "such very broadened pulses could be detected by imaging surveys with relatively short integration times like the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) and future surveys with the australian square kilometer array pathfinder or the allen telescope array .    in between this extreme case of 50-s broadening and the reported pulse width of @xmath145",
    "ms is a substantial search volume in which more distant sources could have produced detectable events . broadening from sources at redshifts greater than one",
    "is increased by the larger electron density but is lessened by the frequency redshift , so the net scaling of the pulse broadening with redshift depends on how the scattering material is distributed along the line of sight .",
    "we have examined the current state of knowledge about various classes of intermittent radio - loud neutron stars , summarized selection effects that may affect the classification of intermittent sources , and presented our data processing methods and results from single pulse searches performed on palfa survey data .",
    "one of our single - pulse discoveries is a relatively persistent emitter that , like many other pulsars , shows a broad amplitude distribution , from which a few bright pulses were detected .",
    "two sources were detected as normal periodic emitters when observed at a lower frequency ( psr  j0627 + 16 ) and with the more sensitive central beam of the alfa receiver ( psr  j1919 + 17 ) .",
    "four objects were most likely not detected via periodicity search because of their long periods ( @xmath209  s ) compared to the palfa observation time of @xmath210  s , and one intermittent object ( psr  j1928 + 15 ) was discovered by detecting three pulses emitted on successive rotations but it was not detected again despite multiple reobservations .",
    "most of the palfa sources that were discovered solely through the single - pulse analysis have subsequently been found to be _ sporadic _ but with measureable and consistent rates of detectable pulses .",
    "the parkes survey had similar results . however , two sources ( the parkes source psr j1839@xmath101 and the palfa source psr j1928 + 15 ) are much more irregular even though an underlying periodicity has been found in each case .",
    "we therefore distinguish between cases where the apparent sporadic behavior is due to a detection threshold that selects only the strongest pulses from a broad distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) and those where emission is truly _",
    "intermittent_.    a major issue is related to the question , if we see transients from a given sky direction only once , how can we figure out what phenomena produce them .",
    "we must archive radio survey data and characterize the wide variety of detected radio transients outside the framework of rotating neutron stars if necessary .",
    "archived data may yield new discoveries if reprocessed with improved search algorithms and a database of transient signals would be an invaluable reference as theoretical understanding of energetic radio events and prediction of their signatures improves .",
    "the palfa survey is taking steps in both directions : raw data are stored in a tape archive and data processing products are indexed in a database at the cornell center for advanced computing and currently work is under way to make them publicly available via a web portal .",
