    "neutrinos are produced in states of given flavors  electron , muon or tau  that are mixtures of mass eigenstates .",
    "as different masses propagate with different phases , the mixture at some distance from a neutrino source may be different from the initial one , resulting in a disappearance of the initial flavor and an appearance of other flavors in the neutrino beam .",
    "quantitatively , the phase of the state of mass @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 at the time @xmath2 from the production is @xmath3 at the distance @xmath4 from the source and , therefore , the disappearance and appearance probabilities depend on the squared mass differences , @xmath5 , ratio @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the neutrino energy , and mixing angles , @xmath8 , describing how mass eigenstates mix to form states of definite flavor .",
    "this phenomenon , called the neutrino oscillations , has been well established in the past two decades and is now considered one of the major discoveries in particle physics , celebrated by two recent nobel prizes  @xcite .",
    "the values of the oscillation parameters  two squared mass differences and three mixing angles  are being measured with an increasing precision , thanks to a global effort that produced a number of experiments currently taking data or planned in the near future .    within the next two decades",
    ", the precision is expected to be sufficient to begin testing the unitarity of the mixing matrix  @xcite , discover the neutrino - mass hierarchy  @xcite and unambiguously determine the value of the dirac phase , @xmath9 , violating the charge - parity ( cp ) symmetry of neutrino mixing  @xcite .",
    "these results are going to have profound consequences for possible extensions of the standard model , building models of the neutrino masses and our understanding of the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe .    in this topical review ,",
    "we discuss systematic uncertainties in ongoing and future long - baseline ( @xmath103001300 km ) neutrino - oscillation experiments using conventional beams  @xcite .",
    "such neutrino beams are tertiary products , originating from the decay of mesons ",
    "predominantly pions  produced in interactions of the primary proton beam with a target . as the resulting neutrinos are not monoenergetic , to extract the oscillation parameters from the collected event distribution , their energies have to be reconstructed on an event - by - event basis from the measured kinematics of particles in the final state . depending on the beamline",
    ", the relevant neutrino energies extend from a few hundred mev to a few gev , at which the dominant interaction mechanisms change from quasielastic to resonant and nonresonant meson production  @xcite .",
    "because the oscillation parameters are extracted from the energy dependence of event distributions , their accurate determination requires an accurate reconstruction of neutrino energy .",
    "while the reconstruction would involve smallest uncertainties for scattering off free protons and deuteron  @xcite , owing to the low cross sections involved , it is necessary to employ nuclear targets as detector materials to ensure high statistics of collected events . as",
    "a consequence , however , description of nuclear effects turns out to be one of the largest sources of systematic uncertainties in the oscillation analysis of modern long - baseline experiments .",
    "additionally , when energy reconstruction requires the kinematics of produced hadrons to be measured , detector effects may play an important role and uncertainties of the detector response contribute to the systematic uncertainties of the extracted oscillation parameters  @xcite .    over the past decade",
    ", the extensive neutrino - scattering program has yielded a wealth of experimental cross sections for carbon or hydrocarbon , ch  @xcite , and much fewer results for other targets , such as water@xcite , argon @xcite , iron @xcite and lead @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that there seem to remain puzzling tensions between different measurements  such as @xcite or @xcite  which have attracted a sizable attention of the theoretical community .",
    "a number of approaches developed to describe nuclear response to other probes has been extended to neutrino interactions , and the understanding of nuclear effects relevant to neutrino - oscillation experiments has clearly improved  @xcite ; see also recent reviews  @xcite .",
    "however , many problems still await a quantitative explanation . while for detector targets containing hydrogen the pion - production events on free protons can be separated out  @xcite , current and future neutrino - oscillation experiments are going to collect data predominantly for interactions with the targets of atomic numbers @xmath11 ranging from 12 to 40 , for which accurate and complete nuclear models permitting fully trustable data analysis are not available yet .",
    "the main difficulty of developing theoretical models useful to oscillation experiments stems from the flux average over polychromatic beams  @xcite . as any data bin may receive contributions from a range of neutrino energies and different interaction mechanisms , understanding the source of discrepancies between theoretical results and experimental data",
    "is a formidable task .",
    "for example , resonant pion production followed by pion absorption in medium leads to the same final state as single - nucleon knockout . at the kinematics of the long - baseline oscillation experiments",
    ", nuclear models must be able to describe relativistic products of interaction .",
    "additionally , experiments employing tracking detectors require predictions of exclusive cross sections for different hadronic final states .",
    "this topical review is organized as follows .",
    "after general remarks regarding systematic uncertainties of measurements of cp violation in , we present our procedure of the oscillation analysis in . in sections",
    "[ sec : nucleareffects ] and [ sec : detectoreffects ] we illustrate the importance of nuclear and detector effects for an accurate reconstruction of neutrino energy and an unbiased extraction of oscillation parameters , discussing selected results from our previous publications  @xcite .",
    "finally in we summarize this review .",
    "in recent and ongoing oscillation experiments , it has been a common practice to use the spread between different theoretical descriptions of nuclear effects , implementations of the same model in monte carlo generators , detector response parametrizations etc . as an estimate of the associated systematic uncertainties .",
    "while this method seems very effective , a word of caution is in order .",
    "non - negligible correlations between the ingredients used to find the uncertainties  such as common assumptions of nuclear models or fine - tuning of event generators to the same data  may lead to sizable underestimates , making this procedure insufficient and unreliable .    for the next 20 years",
    ", the long - baseline neutrino - oscillation program is most likely going to employ conventional beams  @xcite .",
    "this technique of producing neutrino beams has been used for a few decades : an intense proton beam is impinged on a target typically made of beryllium or graphite in order to produce mesons , mainly pions .",
    "the target is embedded within a horn  an electromagnet producing a toroidal magnetic field  that focuses secondary particles of a  selected charge and defocuses those of the opposite charge .",
    "the horn polarization determines whether the resulting beam will be made of neutrinos or antineutrinos .",
    "it is important to point out that the beams and their contaminations by wrong - sign mesons in the neutrino and antineutrino modes are not related in a meaningful way .",
    "therefore , while using the same beamline , target and horn , the neutrino or antineutrino runs of an experiment could be considered two separate experiments .    an accurate determination of the neutrino flux  its flavor composition and energy spectrum  exclusively from the proton - beam parameters , meson - production data for thick targets and horn configuration is a challenging task .",
    "state - of - the - art methods of controlling systematic uncertainties of a neutrino beam have been developed for the minos  @xcite and minerva  @xcite experiments , largely thanks to using two horns of adjustable positions at the numi beamline  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether such a feature  difficult to realize for off - axis beams  is going to be available for future oscillation experiments .",
    "therefore , the beam normalization uncertainty of about 5% achieved in the minos and minerva experiment , can be expected also in future oscillation experiments employing conventional beams .",
    "note , however , that recently proposed new concepts of neutrino beams , such as @xmath12storm  @xcite , would allow the neutrino flux to be determined with an accuracy of the order of 1% .    to extract the probability of oscillation between the neutrino flavors @xmath13 and @xmath14 , experiments collect event distributions @xmath15 with respect to a set of observables @xmath16 , such as the charged lepton s energy and cosine of its production angle , @xmath17 in the above equation , the normalization factor @xmath18 depends on the beam power , data collecting time , fiducial mass etc . the flux expected in the detector , @xmath19 , and the oscillation probability @xmath20 are both functions of the true neutrino energy @xmath7 .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath21 describes likelihood for a neutrino of the flavor @xmath14 and energy @xmath7 to produce an event of kinematics @xmath16 .",
    "the detection efficiency is denoted as @xmath22 .",
    "systematic uncertainties in neutrino - oscillation experiments can be effectively reduced by using an unoscillated event distribution measured in the near detector system to predict the distribution expected in the far detector .",
    "this method of exploiting the cancelation of correlated uncertainties  giving the best results when the near and far detectors are functionally identical  has been used with great success in the reactor experiments daya bay  @xcite , reno  @xcite and double chooz  @xcite to measure the mixing angle @xmath23 with remarkably high precision . barring the differences in the backgrounds and in the geometric acceptances of the beam",
    ", the ratio of the energy - unfolded event distributions in a disappearance experiment , @xmath24 , has in this case the simple interpretation @xmath25 where the far - to - near flux ratio , @xmath26 , reduces to the ratio of the squared distances from the neutrino source , @xmath27 and the oscillation probability in the near detector is @xmath28 .    unlike in the reactor experiments , in long - baseline studies ,",
    "the relevant cross sections are currently known with an accuracy of 1020% and the procedure of energy unfolding in much more involved . additionally , in the near and far sites , different detectors are usually employed and",
    "the differences in backgrounds and beam acceptances are non - negligible . for a disappearance measurement",
    ", minos can serve as a benchmark of how well the near - to - far comparison does reduce systematic uncertainties  @xcite .    in @xmath29 appearance measurements ,",
    "the situation is even more involved .",
    "the final and initial flavors of neutrino are different , which leads to a dependence of the near - to - far event distributions ratio on the cross sections ratio @xmath30 . as the beams are designed to minimize the @xmath31 contamination in order to reduce the background in the far detector , direct measurements of the @xmath31 cross sections suffer from the statistics lower typically by 23 orders of magnitude than in the @xmath32 case and from larger uncertainties coming from both the flux and detector response  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the recent t2k analysis  @xcite , the total systematic uncertainty is estimated to be 16.6% , with the flux and detector - response contributions of 12.9 and 8.4% , respectively .",
    "there are no obvious methods to reduce those uncertainties and measurements for electron antineutrinos are going to be even more challenging .",
    "however , it is important to note that all available data are consistent with lepton universality .    to emphasize the importance of reduction of systematic uncertainties in appearance measurements ,",
    "let us make a simple estimate of those needed for an experiment to probe cp violation at 3@xmath33 confidence level for 75% of the possible @xmath9 values , the goal set by the p5 advisory panel  @xcite .",
    "we consider the cp asymmetry defined as  @xcite @xmath34 the energy average @xmath35 is taken over the full width at half the first oscillation maximum . in vacuum @xmath36 is proportional to @xmath37 and , therefore , for @xmath9 values in the vicinity of 0 and @xmath38 , the uncertainties of @xmath36 are very similar to those of @xmath9 .",
    "baseline dependence of the cp asymmetry   for different @xmath9 values.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    shows the cp asymmetry @xmath36 as a function of the baseline for the @xmath9 values of @xmath39 , 0 , and @xmath40 and the remaining oscillation parameters from a recent global fit  @xcite . for the 1500-km baseline ,",
    "matter effects introduce the asymmetry of @xmath1047% and @xmath9 can modify it by @xmath41 . for 75% of the @xmath9 values ,",
    "the cp asymmetry can become as small as 5% , which at 3@xmath33",
    "confidence level translates into @xmath101.5% accuracy . for equal contributions of statistical and systematic uncertainties ,",
    "the latter are required not to exceed @xmath101% .",
    "fortunately , if the maximal cp violation is realized in nature , as suggested by recent results of the t2k  @xcite and nova  @xcite experiments , less stringent conditions are going to be sufficient for the @xmath9 discovery .",
    "discussing the role of nuclear and detector effects in the oscillation analysis , in sections [ sec : nucleareffects ] and [ sec : detectoreffects ] we present the results obtained using the software package globes  @xcite . simulating data according to  , we keep all the oscillation parameters fixed , setting their values to @xmath42    unless specified otherwise , we perform the @xmath43 disappearance analysis for a setup similar to that of the t2k experiment  @xcite with a narrow - band off - axis beam  @xcite , considering carbon as the detector material .",
    "the main motivation for selecting the @xmath44 channel is that it can effectively be treated as two - flavor oscillations with the probability  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 which allows for a clear interpretation of the obtained results .",
    "as detailed in , the experimental setup consists of the near and far detectors simulated following  @xcite .",
    "the exposure and beam intensity are chosen to ensure that the statistics of unoscillated events is high enough to constrain the analyzed systematic uncertainty .",
    "our treatment of systematic uncertainties , the @xmath47 implementation and the method of determination of the confidence regions is the same as in @xcite .",
    "we assume 20% systematic uncertainties for the shape ( bin - to - bin uncorrelated ) and for the overall normalization ( bin - to - bin correlated ) . adding a gaussian prior for each systematic error , the pull method is used and the final @xmath47 profile is obtained after the minimization over the nuisance parameters .",

    "the energy reconstruction would be perfect . in a realistic case",
    ", however , there is a non - negligible probability of energy misreconstruction @xcite . in our calculations ,",
    "both nuclear and detector effects are encoded in the migration matrices , @xmath59 , the elements of which describe the probability that an event of type @xmath60 with a true energy in the bin @xmath61 is reconstructed with an energy in the bin @xmath62 .",

    "we note that the significance of nuclear effects , analyzed here for the carbon nucleus ( @xmath65 ) , can be expected to increase further for the argon target @xmath83 .",
    "although the considered experimental setup and our procedure of data analysis do not closely follow those of any existing experiment , the discussed results point toward the crucial role that an accurate description of nuclear effects plays in monte carlo simulations of precise oscillation experiments .",
    "for the success of precise oscillation studies it is , therefore , of great importance to continue efforts aiming to provide new cross - section measurements , improve existing monte carlo generators , develop more accurate nuclear models and determine their uncertainties in comparisons with available data .",
    "in the oscillation analysis of long - baseline experiments , neutrino energy is inferred from the kinematics of particles produced in the interaction . as a consequence , the reconstructed energy may be affected by finite detection capabilities  energy resolutions , efficiencies and thresholds  and uncertainties they are known with .",
    "we explore this issue within a realistic scenario , in which particles are detected according to their efficiencies and thresholds , and measured energies and angles are smeared by finite detector resolutions . to analyze how uncertainties of these detector effects may affect the oscillation analysis , we obtain simulated event distributions in the far detector within the realistic scenario and analyze them partly neglecting the detector effects implemented in the migration matrices .",
    "accounting for the effect of finite detector resolution , we smear observables according to the normal distributions centered at their true values . for muons ,",
    "this procedure is applied both to the momentum and production angle , using the realistic parameters  @xcite @xmath84 the energy resolutions of for @xmath85 s producing electromagnetic showers and other hadrons are set to @xmath86 respectively .",

    "the detection thresholds correspond to the measured kinetic energy of 20 mev for mesons and 40 mev for protons . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "the efficiencies are treated as energy - independent and set to 60% for @xmath85 s , 80% for other mesons , and 50% for protons .",
    "owing to difficulties of their reconstruction in neutrino events , we assume that neutrons always escape detection .    in the context of the @xmath32 disappearance analysis  @xcite , we analyze the t2k - like setup described in , following the same treatment of systematic uncertainties and applying the same method of @xmath47 calculations .",
    "our calculations are performed for the expected number of unoscillated events @xmath104900 .    instead of varying individual parameters involved in the detector description ,",
    "we vary the migration matrices making a linear combinations of the those calculated with and without detector effects . in this manner",

    "it is a consequence of very precise reconstruction of muon kinematics achieved in modern experiments and assumed in this analysis , see  .",
    "same as figure [ fig : deteff_kin ] but for the calorimetric energy reconstruction.,scaledwidth=39.0% ]    on the other hand , we observe that detector effects play an important role in the calorimetric reconstruction method , in which the neutrino energy is inferred from the energies deposited in detector by all interaction products .",
    "shows that in order to avoid a significant bias in the extracted values of the oscillation parameters , the detector response has to be determined with an accuracy of at least 10% .",
    "this behavior can be traced back to much larger uncertainties in the hadron - energy determination , see , entering the calorimetric method of neutrino energy reconstruction .",
    "while the results of figures [ fig : deteff_kin ] and [ fig : deteff_cal ] are obtained for the narrow beam peaked at @xmath100.6  gev  @xcite , the conclusions on influence of detector effects seem to be valid in more general case , as suggested by the findings for a  wide - band beam with the peak at @xmath101.6 gev and a non - negligible contribution of energies above 3 gev  @xcite .    owing to the very complicated oscillation probability ,",
    "an accurate neutrino - energy reconstruction is of particular importance for appearance experiments , observing electron ( anti)neutrinos from oscillations of muon ( anti)neutrinos . in this context",
    ", we analyze the role of missing energy  @xcite  carried away from event by undetected particles  on the @xmath9 sensitivity for an experiment similar to dune  @xcite .    in the considered setup ,",
    "a wide - band neutrino beam is produced in interactions of the initial 1.08-mw proton beam with the target material and aimed at the far detector of fiducial mass 40 kton , located 1300 km from the source .",

    "we consider 2% uncertainties of normalization ( bin - to - bin correlated ) and shape ( bin - to - bin uncorrelated ) .",
    "for the background , only a global normalization uncertainty of 5% is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the simulated event distributions are obtained accounting for all detector effects  resolutions , efficiencies , and thresholds . on the other hand , extracting the oscillation parameters , we construct the migration matrices as linear combinations of those calculated with and without the shift resulting from the missing energy . in this way , for the purpose of this analysis , we single out the role of missing energy from other detector effects .",

    "right : @xmath87 confidence regions in @xmath89 plane obtained when the simulated data are fitted using the migration matrices accounting for 90% , 80% and 70% ( lines ) of the missing energy and when all the missing energy is accounted for ( shaded area ) .",
    "the dot shows the assumed true values of the oscillation parameters.,scaledwidth=39.0% ]    its influence on the reconstructed - energy distribution is illustrated in the left panel of for the example of deep - inelastic scattering of electron neutrino .",
    "it clearly appears that owing to undetected particles in the final state , the maximum of the distribution is shifted to an energy lower than the true neutrino energy .",
    "as the composition of particles in the final state differs for neutrinos and antineutrinos and depends on the interaction channel and the probe s energy , this is also the case for the energy carried away by undetected particles .",
    "this can be expected to have important consequences for the oscillation analysis .",
    "as presented in the right panel of , even a 20% underestimation of the missing energy introduces a sizable bias in the extracted @xmath9 value .",
    "should the missing energy be underestimated by 30% , the analysis would exclude the true value of @xmath9 at a confidence level between 2 and 3@xmath33 .",
    "this result illustrates the importance of an accurate determination of detector response in test - beam exposures and the relevance of a realistic simulation of nuclear effects in neutrino interactions , including intranuclear cascade .",
    "we would like to emphasize that while our results are meant to point out the importance of various aspects of detector effects , much more detailed studies are necessary to draw truly quantitative conclusions for specific experiments .",
    "in particular , our treatment of the missing - energy uncertainty  assumed to be equal for neutrinos and antineutrinos and independent of the energy and interaction channel  may be regarded as simplistic .",
    "however , as more realistic sensitivity estimates would require an accurate knowledge of the detector response and inclusion of nuclear - model uncertainties , out of necessity , we leave them for future investigations within experimental collaborations .",
    "thanks to tremendous progress in experimental neutrino physics over the last two decades , systematic uncertainties in oscillation studies have been greatly reduced . as a consequence ,",
    "however , those arising from description of nuclear effects and related to determination of detector response have become very important in current appearance measurements .",
    "this is going to be even more so in future experiments aiming to unambiguously discover the lepton - sector contribution to violation of charge - particle symmetry .    in this topical review , we have discussed a few examples illustrating the relevance of an accurate description of quasielastic interactions with any number of knocked - out nucleons and argued that for pion production a similar effect is expected .",
    "we pointed out that comparisons to electron scattering data provide opportunity to test nuclear models and estimate their uncertainties ; they also allow for much clearer interpretation of discrepancies than neutrino data .",
    "discussing detector effects , we have drawn attention to their larger importance for experiments employing the calorimetric method of energy reconstruction and emphasized the key role of an accurate estimate of the missing energy for precise oscillation studies .    as a final remark",
    "we reiterate that future experiments are going to require coordinated efforts toward improving theoretical descriptions of nuclear effects , implementing them in monte carlo generators and determining detector response in extensive test - beam exposures .",
    "however , the discoveries coming in the next two decades have the potential to overshadow those of the past two decades .",
