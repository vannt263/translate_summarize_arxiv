    "extreme star formation rates of @xmath10  yr@xmath4 have been derived for luminous infrared galaxies discovered by deep @xmath11 surveys @xcite . in such radiation - pressure supported galactic disks with the maximum starburst @xcite , large scale outflows can be triggered by superwinds from massive young stars and supernova explosions , which may play important roles in galaxy formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "galactic outflows can regulate star formation by heating cool gas @xcite .",
    "they can enrich both intergalactic medium and galactic disks @xcite .",
    "their feedback can also explain the apparent discrepancy between the theoretical prediction of the dark matter halo mass function and the measured stellar mass function for galaxies in the successful @xmath12cdm scenario @xcite .",
    "in this letter , we probe kinematic signatures of molecular outflows in a sample of 27 ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) recently studied by @xcite . a large fraction of ulirgs are mainly powered by merger - induced starbursts @xcite and hence make good targets for investigating associated outflows .",
    "evidence for such an outflow has been reported in a single ulirg system such as arp  220 @xcite and mrk  231 @xcite .",
    "those outflow signatures are however too faint to be detected individually in our ulirg sample .",
    "therefore we employ a stacking analysis to look for faint and broad high velocity line wings in the @xmath0co line profile . in order to inspect outflow driving mechanisms ,",
    "our ulirg sample is partitioned into two groups based on optical emission line diagnostics : starburst dominated galaxies and galaxies with large agn contributions . with the reduced noise in the stacked composite spectrum",
    ", we also measure the average brightness of other weaker molecular lines such as @xmath9co(10 ) and @xmath0cn(10 ) , as an independent measurement of molecular gas properties , that have been detected only in the nearest @xmath11 luminous galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use the sample and the data from the recent redshift search receiver ( rsr ) @xmath0co @xmath13 survey of local ulirgs by @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out with the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) 14 m telescope in 2007 and 2008 , targeting 29 ulirgs at @xmath1 . as discussed in detail by @xcite ,",
    "this is a representative subset of ulirgs as the primary selection criteria were those related to observational scheduling and the redshift range that brings the @xmath0co @xmath14 line within the bandpass of the rsr system . in our stacking analysis , we include only the 27 co detected objects .",
    "the co line luminosity @xmath15 of the sample ranges from 1.2 to 15.3@xmath16k  km  s@xmath4  pc@xmath17 with a median value of 6.7@xmath16k  km  s@xmath4  pc@xmath17 .",
    "the stacking of the rsr spectra is performed using the following procedure .",
    "first , each coadded spectrum is shifted to the rest frequency by multiplying the observed frequency by ( 1+@xmath18 ) , where @xmath18 is the co redshift of each ulirg derived from the line fitting @xcite .",
    "each co spectrum is normalized by the best fit gaussian peak , and then all spectra are _",
    "`` aligned '' _ at the frequency centroid .",
    "a linear interpolation is used in the alignment process .",
    "the normalized spectra are averaged , weighted by the @xmath19 `` noise '' measured in the normalized spectra , excluding the @xmath20ghz regions around the three transitions of our interest , @xmath9co , @xmath0cn , and @xmath0co as well as the noisy end channels .",
    "finally , the averaged spectrum is hanning smoothed to produce the final spectral resolution of 61  mhz ( 158  km  s@xmath4 at 115.27  ghz ) .",
    "a `` non - ulirg '' comparison spectrum was derived by stacking the rsr spectra of 19 @xmath21 galaxies selected for their high hi mass ( @xmath22 ; haynes et al . in prep .",
    ", oneil et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "these 19 galaxies were selected from another rsr commissioning programs - the co survey of 29 hi rich galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "nineteen galaxies were detected in co with comparable @xmath23 and sensitivity as our ulirg sample , but they are otherwise normal in their star formation and nuclear activities .",
    "these hi rich galaxies mostly look like normal spirals in the optical and their mean @xmath8 luminosity is @xmath24 , 30 times lower than that of our ulirg sample .",
    "their @xmath25 of 0.43.2@xmath26  k  km  s@xmath4  pc@xmath17 is only slightly smaller than that of our ulirg sample .",
    "further details of the rsr co observations of these hi - rich spirals will be presented elsewhere ( chung et al . in prep ) .",
    "the rms noise in the final spectra for the ulirg sample and the control sample , normalized by the @xmath0co peak flux , are 0.014 and 0.027 , respectively , yielding the s / n that is better than those of individual spectra by a factor of 5 to 47 ( see table  [ tbl - stack ] ) . figure  [ fig - chemi ] shows the stacked , normalized spectrum of a broad frequency range ( 109.65116.25  ghz ) which includes all three transitions , @xmath9co ( 10 ) , @xmath0cn ( 10 ) , and @xmath0co ( 10 ) . in figure  [ fig - stack ] , we zoom in the 4500  km  s@xmath4 range around the @xmath0co line to show the characteristics of the profile more in detail .",
    "the stacked spectrum of the ulirg group has revealed broad wings around the co line as seen on the top of figure  [ fig - chemi ] .. the wings are blue- and redshifted by @xmath27 km  s@xmath4 from the main co line peak ( fwzi of 2000  km  s@xmath4 ) with the total line integral of 19@xmath5% of the total ( see fig .  [ fig - stack ] ) .",
    "the line wings of the ulirg stacked spectrum are detected with s / n@xmath28 in each channel , which would be difficult to be detected in individual spectra .",
    "in fact , the effective integration time of the stacked ulirg spectrum is 115.8  hrs , 1060 times more than the integration on individual ulirgs .",
    "note that such wings are not present in the control sample of hi rich galaxies with the effective integration 127.7  hrs as shown on the bottom of figure  [ fig - chemi ] .",
    "the comparison of the ulirgs with the non - ulirg population is better shown in the upper two panels of figure  [ fig - stack ] .    [",
    "cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     such broad wings can form when entrained cool gas gets ejected along with hot ionized outflowing gas @xcite . in order to examine whether a starburst or an agn is powering the outflow , we have divided the ulirg sample into two groups : ( 1 ) 14 ulirgs which are classified as `` sbrst '' or `` hii '' ( sb group ) with no obvious sign of agns ; and ( 2 ) 13 ulirgs with `` seyfert '' spectra ( agn group ) .",
    "this grouping is done based on the classification from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "objects with a `` liner '' classification are included in the agn group unless it also has a `` sbrst '' or `` hii '' designation . galaxies with a hybrid ( `` sy+sb / hii '' )",
    "classification are included in the agn group . among our sample , eight ulirgs from each group have been modeled in their spectral energy distribution by @xcite who found an agn contribution to the @xmath11 luminosity of @xmath2927% for the eight in the agn group , which is a factor of two higher than that of the eight in the sb group ( @xmath30% ) . the mean s / n measured by the ratio of the co line peak and the rms is highest for the sb group due to a few objects with the strongest co emission among the sample , but this ratio does not vary significantly from group to group .",
    "in fact , the mean rms of each group and the co linewidths of different groups are very similar as summarized in table  [ tbl - stack ] , making our results robust .",
    "we show the comparison of the two groups on the bottom of figure  [ fig - stack ] .",
    "the rms noise in the normalized stacked spectra is 0.0189 and 0.032 for the sb group and the agn group , respectively .",
    "the wings around @xmath0co line appears to be even stronger in the sb group compared to the wings seen in the entire ulirg sample , with more flux in the wings which is about 25% of the total co flux .",
    "these broad features however disappear when only the ulirgs with seyfert spectra are combined .",
    "the total line flux was measured by integrating the line flux density within the fwzi regions ( thin solid lines in fig .",
    "1 ) for both groups with and without wings .",
    "the wing - only flux was measured within the same fwzi as the agn group and the control sample , and the difference between the total and the line wing flux has been adopted as the co flux for these groups . the fractional flux in the wings and the upper limits of different subgroups are summarized in table  [ tbl - stack ] .",
    "@xcite also found a lower frequency of neutral wind among seyfert 2 ulirgs in their study of na  i  d absorption line in 26 agn / starburst - composite ulirgs at @xmath31 , further supporting the starburst origin for this massive neutral wind .",
    "the energetics of the neutral wind traced in broad co wings is also consistent with being powered by the ongoing starburst traced in the far - infrared .",
    "the energy injection rate ( @xmath32 ) in a wind - blown bubble of a radius @xmath33 expanding at velocity @xmath34 into an infinite homogeneous medium with density @xmath35 can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath36 adopting a bubble size of @xmath37kpc @xcite found for the high velocity molecular wind in arp  220 , an outflow velocity of @xmath38  km  s@xmath4 from the line wing velocity in the stacked spectrum , and an ambient density of 10  @xmath39 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we drive an energy injection rate of @xmath40  ergs  s@xmath4 . assuming an energy output per supernova of @xmath41  ergs @xcite , our estimated @xmath32 yields a supernova rate , @xmath42 of @xmath43  yr@xmath4 . using a scalo initial mass function ( imf ) with a mass range of @xmath44 , the star formation rate inferred from this supernova rate ( @xmath45  yr@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath46yr@xmath4 .",
    "this agrees well with the @xmath7 derived from the @xmath8 luminosity for these ulirgs , 134 - 352  @xmath47yr@xmath4 ( see eq",
    ". 8 of * ? ? ?",
    "the outflow speed implied by the co line wings , @xmath38  km  s@xmath4 , is comparable to the wind velocity measured by other phases of the superwind such as h@xmath48 and na  d ( 400 - 800  km  s@xmath4 , * ? ? ? * ) and oh ( 1400  km  s@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "if they all trace the same outflow , then eq . ( 1 ) suggests that the spatial extent of na d and h@xmath48 should be larger ( @xmath49kpc ) while the spatial scale for the oh winds measured by herschel would be more compact ( @xmath50  kpc ) than the co wind . the fact that wind velocities measured in molecular outflows are larger than in the optical may indicate that supernova driven wind embedded in molecular gas slows down by the time it breaks out of the starburst region .",
    "the inferred outflow speed exceeds the escape velocity and is high enough to blow away the molecular gas that hosts the star formation activity and to pollute the surrounding igm significantly . depending on whether the co line is optically thin or thick , the outflowing molecular gas mass ranges between 1 - 6@xmath51 .",
    "the line wings are symmetric in intensity and shape on both sides of the line , and this suggests that the wings are bipolar in geometry and likely optically thin .",
    "this is not contradictory to the highly asymmetric co @xmath52 line wings in arp  220 ( fwzi = 1000  km  s@xmath4 ) found by @xcite since the @xmath53 line has a higher optical depth .",
    "these observations suggest that more than @xmath54 of molecular gas can be removed from the central starburst region through such a wind , rapidly depleting the gas supply for the starburst .",
    "some of this gas may eventually rain back onto the galaxy , enriching the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "our conclusion that the central starburst can power the observed massive outflow contradicts the conclusion by @xcite that the 750  km  s@xmath4 wind in co @xmath55 found in mrk  231 is powered by the agn activity and thus is an example of a `` quasar feedback '' at work .",
    "although @xcite adopted a smaller than galactic co - to - h@xmath56 conversion factor , they may still have over - estimated gas mass and mass outflow rate as an optically thin estimate leads to a @xmath57 times smaller gas mass , lowering the mass outflow rate much closer to the current @xmath7 . a stronger case for an agn - driven molecular outflow",
    "is found in ngc  1266 where the optically thin co mass outflow rate clearly exceeds the observed current @xmath7 ( alatalo et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "the co outflow velocity is much lower ( @xmath58  km  s@xmath4 ) , however , and this phenomenon may not be very common , at least at low-@xmath59 , since this is the only object with an agn - driven molecular outflow found in their survey of a large number of early - type galaxies . @xcite",
    "have shown that an agn - driven molecular outflow may persist longer than a sb - driven outflow using a numerical simulation , but the accuracy of such model predictions and the sub - grid physics included needs to be tested further using a large sample of agn+sb systems .",
    "two important molecular transitions also appear in our stacked composite spectra , and we examine their line strengths to gain further insights into the molecular ism in these ulirgs .",
    "those are the lowest transitions of @xmath9co and @xmath0cn ( cn hereafter ) at 110.20 and 113.50  ghz , which have been detected in local starburst and seyfert galaxies @xcite . in the rsr composite spectra",
    ", we find @xmath60 bumps at both @xmath9co and cn frequencies only in the agn ulirg group with the flux ratios , @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath0co/@xmath9co and @xmath0co / cn , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig - chemi ] ) .",
    "the other groups do not show such features , and the lower limits in @xmath0co/@xmath9co and @xmath0co / cn are summarized in table  [ tbl - stack ] .",
    "the same linewidths as the agn group have been adopted to calculate the upper limits of @xmath9co ( 660  km  s@xmath4 ) and cn ( 600  km  s@xmath4 ) for the other groups .",
    "the ratio @xmath0co/@xmath9co ( @xmath63 ) has been reported to be generally larger in starburst galaxies ( @xmath64 , * ? ? ?",

    "increased velocity dispersion within gmcs and a broader cloud - to - cloud velocity distribution can reduce the @xmath9co opacity within these starburst nuclei .",
