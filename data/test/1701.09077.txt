    "when magnetic materials are involved in transport measurements the spin has an impact on the resistance , in general coined magnetoresistance ( mr ) .",
    "the most prominent example is the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr )  @xcite , which occurs when current flows between two magnetic electrodes separated by a non - magnetic metallic spacer .",
    "a similar setup is used to measure tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr )  @xcite , where the metallic spacer is exchanged with an insulating tunnel barrier .",
    "because in both cases the conductance depends on the relative alignment of the magnetization in the two electrodes , one of them can be used to read out the magnetic state of the other one .",
    "the tmr can be exploited in a spatially resolved scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurement , when the tip is spin - polarized ; such spin - polarized stm measurements can reveal spin structures at surfaces down to the atomic scale  @xcite .",
    "changes in mr can be described in scattering models  @xcite or based on electronic band structure effects  @xcite . because in scanning tunnel spectroscopy ( sts ) the differential conductance ( d@xmath0/d@xmath1 ) reflects the vacuum local density of states ( ldos ) ,",
    "stm can be used to study the latter .",
    "recently , the mr change due to the presence of a domain wall has been discussed  @xcite . however , different types of mr are expected in the presence of a domain wall , and a separation of different effects is experimentally difficult because the measured signal is a combination of several effects . due to",
    "its spatial resolution stm has been a key method to unravel the changes of the vacuum ldos of a domain wall : the difference between the center of the wall ( in - plane magnetization ) and a domain ( out - of - plane ) was detected with a non - magnetic tip and it was pinned down by accompanying density functional theory ( dft ) calculations of the electronic band structure to a mixing of states due to spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , resulting in tunnel anisotropic magnetoresistance ( tamr )  @xcite .",
    "recently , stm measurements have identified an mr effect , which originates from the non - collinearity of a spin texture  @xcite .",
    "the observed non - collinear magnetoresistance ( ncmr ) , see sketch in inset to fig.[fig1](a ) , arises due to spin mixing effects because of electron hopping between atoms with canted magnetic moments , as demonstrated by two - band tight - binding as well as ab - initio dft calculations .",
    "these theoretical approaches for the system of a pdfe bilayer on ir(111 ) have demonstrated that the electronic band structure of this material is different for collinear versus non - collinear spin configurations  @xcite .",
    "this explains the experimental observation that skyrmions are electronically different compared to their ferromagnetic surrounding , enabling an all - electrical detection scheme .",
    "ncmr is a general effect , but it is not always straightforward to disentangle from other mr effects , in particular the tamr , which typically leads to a maximal mr change for perpendicular magnetization quantization axes . while the tamr originates from soc and is thus usually limited to a few percent , the ncmr results from a spin mixing and values up to @xmath2 have been found experimentally for pdfe  @xcite , with mr defined by : @xmath3 where d@xmath0/d@xmath1 is the differential conductance signal at a non - collinear ( nc ) or ferromagnetic ( fm ) position of the spin texture .",
    "furthermore , whereas the tamr is an on - site effect , which depends on the local quantization axis of the magnetization , ncmr is governed by the details of the spin texture in the local environment .    a theoretical investigation including soc of a closely related pdfe system , i.e.  with a different stacking of the pd layer , has evaluated the contributions of non - collinearity and soc to the energy - dependent mr in the skyrmion center :",
    "although both contributions are comparable for extremely small skyrmions , the soc has a minor effect for more realistically sized skyrmions , however , the effect of the non - collinearity was found to be as large as @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "other theoretical studies of spin spirals in atomic chains  @xcite and films  @xcite have also found that the impact of soc on the total mr is less than @xmath5 , and that the conductance change due to the non - collinearity is dominating the transport .",
    "recent experimental studies have shown that discrete jumps in magnetic field dependent mr can be linked to the appearance and disappearance of individual skyrmion tubes in a wire  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend the investigation of the previously studied system of pdfe on ir(111 ) and present a more detailed analysis , in particular of the central finding of the response of a susceptible peak in the differential conductance and its relation to the non - collinearity  @xcite .",
    "first , we present data which demonstrates that the ncmr effect occurs also for the zero magnetic field spin spiral ground state and in both stackings of the pd on fe .",
    "then we turn to the magnetic skyrmions , that arise in this system upon application of a perpendicular magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "we look closely into the magnetic field dependent details of the skyrmion spin texture  @xcite and correlate the evolution of the peak energy as well as its intensity with the different parameters that characterize the local spin configuration .",
    "we conclude with a discussion about the different local contributions to the total mr in these non - collinear spin textures .",
    "the experiments were performed in a multi - chamber ultra - high vacuum system with separate chambers for substrate cleaning , metal deposition , and stm measurements .",
    "the ir crystal was cleaned by repeated cycles of sputtering and annealing , and from time to time heating in oxygen .",
    "iron was deposited onto the ir(111 ) surface at elevated temperature to obtain step - flow growth of the fcc stacking  @xcite and subsequently pd was deposited  @xcite .",
    "two different stms were used with base temperatures of 4.2k and 8k , and the tip material was either cr or w. maps of differential conductance ( d@xmath0/d@xmath1 ) were measured simultaneously to constant - current ( @xmath0 ) topographic images at identical sample bias voltage ( @xmath1 ) with closed feedback loop .",
    "scanning tunnel spectroscopy ( sts ) , d@xmath0/d@xmath1(@xmath1 ) , was performed with open feedback loop ; the stabilization parameters ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) before switching off the feedback loop were chosen with particular care to ensure that the tip - sample distance does not depend on the magnetic state of the sample , i.e.  in first approximation the laterally - resolved spectroscopic data represents constant - height spectroscopy .",
    "the d@xmath0/d@xmath1 signal was measured via lock - in technique where the bias voltage was modulated with @xmath8 at a frequency of about 2.6khz .",

    "the measurement was performed with a non - magnetic tip and the dark irregular stripes connected to the step edges of the ir(111 ) substrate indicate the fe monolayer grown in fcc stacking .",
    "the islands on top of the fe are monolayer pd patches and different signal strengths indicate different stackings .",
    "a d@xmath0/d@xmath1 map of the area indicated by the black rectangle is shown again in fig.[fig1](b ) with an hcp pdfe island on the left and an fcc pdfe stripe to the right .",
    "in addition to the different contrast levels due to the pd stacking one can observe a stripe pattern indicative of the spin spiral states : the observed d@xmath0/d@xmath1 contrast originates from the ncmr at this sample bias of + 0.7v . because of the non - negligible out - of - plane anisotropy of pdfe  @xcite the spin spiral is inhomogeneous and the d@xmath0/d@xmath1 signal is higher for out - of - plane regions with smaller angles between neighboring magnetic moments as compared to in - plane magnetic moments with larger angles between them  @xcite .",
    "note that while there is no external magnetic field applied this is not the virgin state and some interconnected in - plane rings have remained after a previous magnetic field sweep .    when an external magnetic out - of - plane field is applied single magnetic skyrmions can be found in pdfe of both stackings , see fig.[fig1](c ) for a d@xmath0/d@xmath1 map of the same area at @xmath16 t . at this magnetic field strength",
    "the skyrmions appear as dark spots due to the ncmr ( see dotted circles ) ; the skyrmions form due to the interface - induced dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and thus have unique rotational sense and are of cycloidal nature  @xcite . to study the electronic states of pdfe in the different magnetic phases local sts has been employed : fig.[fig1](d ) and ( e ) show spectra at positions of highest and lowest d@xmath0/d@xmath1 signal of the spin spiral ( compare colored circles in ( b ) ) as well as for the ferromagnetic region and the skyrmion center ( compare colored circles in ( c ) ) for hcp and fcc pdfe , respectively .",
    "all spectra are featureless at negative sample bias ( not shown ) but show characteristic peaks in the unoccupied states : the ferromagnetic states have a single peak at around @xmath17v , which shifts towards higher energy for the spin spiral states and the skyrmion centers ; at the same time the intensity of this peak decreases . as demonstrated previously  @xcite a two peak structure",
    "is found for the skyrmion center of the hcp pdfe , and this change of the electronic structure has been modeled by tight - binding based on density function theory ( dft ) calculations for the ferromagnetic state which neglect soc  @xcite and has been shown to originate from ncmr .",
    "in addition , the vacuum ldos , which correlates with the experimentally measured d@xmath0/d@xmath1 , has been obtained from these dft calculations for the ferromagnetic state and a spin spiral with a period of 5.14 nm , very similar to the experimentally observed one . for both stackings the agreement between the calculated vacuum ldos and the experimentally obtained spectra is very nice , except for a rigid shift by about 0.2v  @xcite .",
    "other dft calculations for extremely small skyrmions for fcc pdfe , this time including soc , have been published in ref . and show a peak at about 0.6v for the ferromagnetic state , which shifts to smaller energies upon introducing non - collinearity , in contrast to the experimentally observed shift of the peak at 0.7v to higher energies .    /d@xmath1",

    "this plot demonstrates that the diameter ( defined as distance from in - plane to in - plane ) changes from about 4 nm at 1 t to about 2 nm at 2.5 t , and that also the general shape of the skyrmion changes with external magnetic field .",
    "previous analysis  @xcite has revealed that the peak energy in the center of a skyrmion scales roughly linear with the nearest - neighbor angle @xmath24 , see inset to fig.[fig2](e ) . while for a spin in the center of a skyrmion the angle @xmath25 to all six nearest - neighbors on the hexagonal lattice is the same ( @xmath24 ) , i.e.  the environment is symmetric , the situation is different for other positions within a skyrmion , compare configurations indicated by circles in the sketch of the spin structure of a magnetic skyrmion at 1.75 t in fig.[fig2](c ) . to account also for such inhomogeneous environments with different nearest - neighbor angles @xmath25",
    ", we calculate the mean angle @xmath26 to the six nearest neighbors from the given spin texture and plot it as a function of distance from the skyrmion center , see fig.[fig2](e ) .",
    "this parameter @xmath26 can be interpreted as the generalized degree of non - collinearity , and we find that its maximum value moves towards the center of the skyrmion as the external magnetic field is increased .",
    "the question arises , whether the peak energy directly reflects the local mean angle @xmath26 , as suggested by the direct correlation of peak energy and nearest - neighbor angle @xmath24 in the center of the skyrmion , see inset to fig.[fig2](e ) .",
    "we can crosscheck this for the 1.75 t skyrmion : both in the center of the skyrmion as well as at a distance of about 1.6 nm from the center @xmath26 is about @xmath27 .",
    "however , comparison of the experimental spectra obtained at the respective positions within the skyrmion ( fig.[fig2](b ) center and rim ) reveals that such a strict correlation between peak energy and mean angle @xmath26 can not be confirmed .",
    "although the two selected positions within the 1.75 t skyrmion ( compare groups of atoms indicated by the circles in fig.[fig2](c ) ) have the same mean angle @xmath26 there are also two obvious differences : first , the variation in the six nearest - neighbor angles @xmath25 , which can be quantified by the standard deviation @xmath28 of the mean angle @xmath26 , is different ( compare also distance - dependent plots for selected magnetic fields in fig.[fig2](f ) ) .",
    "naturally the standard deviation @xmath28 is zero for the collinear state outside the skyrmion as well as for the symmetric spin arrangement in the center of the skyrmion .",
    "however , at all other positions within the skyrmion it is finite .",
    "the second apparent difference for the two positions with the same mean angle is the quantization axis of the magnetization , which is reflected by @xmath29 as plotted in fig.[fig2](g ) : the magnetization quantization axis can also modify electronic states due to soc , resulting in tamr  @xcite . in a magnetic skyrmion a potential tamr contribution @xmath30 is identical in its center and outside , and it is maximal different for the in - plane spins , cf .",

    "it is natural to try to generalize this dependence for the mean angle @xmath26 when considering arbitrary positions within the skyrmion .",
    "to analyze the relation between the experimentally observed peak energy and intensity with the degree of non - collinearity , we plot these parameters not as a function of the distance from the skyrmion center , but as a function of @xmath26 at the respective position , see fig.[fig4](a , b ) .",
    "the three data points for the center of the skyrmions at the different magnetic field values are indicated by crosses , and the black line represents a linear fit to these data points and the ferromagnetic reference . while the data points for the intensity ( b ) have the tendency to be below the line , we conclude that the peak intensity in first approximation scales with @xmath26 , irrespective of the applied field and the detailed spin configuration .",
    "this might be linked to a previous theoretical finding reported in ref . ,",
    "in which the leading order contribution to the relative mr change due to the rotating magnetization was found to be proportional to the inverse of the spin spiral wave length , i.e.  proportional to the nearest neighbor angles of a spin spiral .",
    "in contrast , there are strong systematic deviations from a linear behavior for the peak energy , see fig.[fig4](a ) : except for the positions in the skyrmion center the peak energy is significantly lower than the fit line , and even nearly constant for mean angles between @xmath41 at @xmath37 t . for a change of the angle in the skyrmion center of @xmath42 we find a peak shift of about 60mv ; however , we can find the same peak shift for different positions within a skyrmion that have the same mean angle , e.g.  @xmath43 at @xmath44 t ( at the skyrmion center and about 1.6 nm away from it , see also red dot in fig.[fig2](e ) ) .",

    "we now come back to the details of the skyrmion spin texture , cf .",
    "fig.[fig2](c ) : different positions can be characterized by the polar angle of the magnetization @xmath23 , the mean angle @xmath26 , the degree of inhomogeneity @xmath28 , and the quantization axis given by cos@xmath45 .",
    "because @xmath26 alone does not describe the evolution of the peak energy , we analyze whether one of the latter two parameters also plays a role : the insets to fig.[fig5](a , b ) show @xmath28 and cos@xmath45 as a function of the mean angle , and the main panels demonstrate that either one can , together with the linear dependence on @xmath26 , describe the general trend of the peak energy for all three magnetic field values .",
    "while the agreement using @xmath28 seems to be better for positions closer to the ferromagnetic surrounding , the shape of the cos@xmath45 fits slightly better towards the center of the skyrmion .",
    "we have studied the magnetic field dependent vacuum d@xmath0/d@xmath1 of skyrmions in the system of pdfe on ir(111 ) and analyzed in more detail the previously observed peak , which is sensitive to the local spin texture , regarding the energy and the intensity .",
    "the peak intensity is found to be roughly linear with the local mean angle between neighboring magnetic moments , reflecting the degree of non - collinearity .",
    "in contrast , while the peak energy in the skyrmion center is proportional to its magnetic field dependent mean angle , we observe significant deviations from a linear behavior of the peak energy elsewhere in the skyrmion .",
    "we demonstrate that this could be attributed either to the inhomogeneity of the local spin texture as represented by the standard deviation of nearest neighbor spin angles , or to the mixing of states due to soc , as manifested in tamr .",
    "the latter depends on the local magnetization quantization axis and leads to a variation of the density of states from site to site across the skyrmion .",
    "while this has a direct effect on the band structure , also a more indirect effect is possible : when the bands that are altered by soc are also involved in the ncmr , a slight modification of electronic states due to soc may lead to a significant change of the density of states when the spin bands mix with each other , resulting in an enhanced ncmr signal .",
    "this possible interplay also implies that the relevant effects determining the peak shift need not be additive , as suggested by the simplistic illustration of fig.[fig5 ] , but can induce more complicated behavior of the ldos .",
    "the presented detailed experimental study can serve as a benchmark for future theoretical studies regarding the magnetoresistive properties of non - collinear states .",
    "regardless of the details of the mechanism for the peak shift and intensity change the variation of the mr is large and we propose to use it as a means to detect and investigate the spin texture of non - collinear states .",
