    "radio continuum data alone , however , only describe the present distribution of cr electrons , without providing any information regarding the initial source distribution or propagation history .",
    "the close spatial correlation between the thermal dust and non - thermal synchrotron emission within galaxies argues for a shared origin , presumably massive star formation @xcite .",
    "young massive stars , still in or near their dusty natal molecular cloud , emit photons that are re - radiated by dust grains at far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths .",
    "these stars are also the progenitors of supernovae ( sne ) whose remnants ( snrs ) are thought to accelerate cr electrons responsible for synchrotron radiation . since the mean free path of dust - heating photons ( @xmath0100  pc )",
    "is far shorter than the diffusion length of cr electrons ( @xmath01 - 2  kpc ) , @xcite conjectured that the radio image of a galaxy should resemble a smoothed version of its infrared image .",
    "this prescription has been shown to hold for galaxies observed at the `` super resolution '' ( @xmath11@xmath2 ) of _ iras _ hires data @xcite . using _",
    "spitzer _ imaging , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m06 ) tested this model on sub - kiloparsec scales within four nearby galaxies and found it applicable to first order , improving the correlation between the infrared and radio maps while leaving patterns in the residuals that mirror the structure in the galaxy s image .",
    "more recently , @xcite has found that within the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , synchrotron halos around individual star - forming regions are more extended than fir - emitting regions , corroborating this phenomenology on scales @xmath350  pc .    in this _",
    "letter _ we explore how star formation activity affects the relative spatial distributions of fir and radio continuum emission for a sample of 12 spiral galaxies observed as part of the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) legacy science project @xcite and the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt)-sings radio continuum survey .",
    "this analysis builds on that of m06 , though the larger sample has increased the range in star formation rates ( sfrs ) investigated by a factor of @xmath05 .",
    "such a study is only now possible due to the high spatial resolution and sensitivity of the _ spitzer _ space telescope at fir wavelengths .",
    "observations at 24 , 70 , and 160  @xmath4 were obtained using the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; * ? ? ? * ) as part of the sings legacy science program .",
    "the mips data were processed using the mips data analysis tool ( dat ; * ? ? ? * ) and included in the sings data release 3 ( dr3 ) .",
    "details on the data reduction can be found in m06 . the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the mips 24 , 70 , and 160  @xmath4 point spread functions ( psfs ) are 5@xmath57 , 17@xmath6 , and 38@xmath6 , respectively , and the final calibration uncertainty is @xmath010  % at 24  @xmath4 and @xmath020  % at 70 and 160  @xmath4 .",
    "radio continuum imaging at 22  cm was performed using the wsrt .",
    "each galaxy was observed in a configuration with particularly good sampling at short baselines to curtail flux loss at low spatial frequencies .",
    "the wsrt data were cleaned and self - calibrated using an imaging pipeline based on the miriad package .",
    "the final clean maps were restored with 18@xmath6 fwhm circular gaussian beams .",
    "total intensity calibration of the data was performed in the aips package and the flux density calibration of the radio maps is better than 5  % .",
    "a complete description of the image processing can be found in @xcite .    to properly match the resolution of the mips and radio images , the fourier transform ( ft ) of the 70  @xmath4 images",
    "was divided by the ft of a model of the mips 70  @xmath4 psf , and then multiplied by the ft of a gaussian psf matching that used as the clean restoring beam .",
    "the final product was then transformed back into the image plane , and checked to ensure flux was conserved . by matching the resolution of the mips and radio data with gaussian beams , rather than the mips 70  @xmath4 psf ( which has significant power in its wings ) , the dynamic range of the 70  @xmath4 images has increased by roughly a factor @xmath02 . due to the improved resolution",
    "there is also a slight increase in the rms noise of the maps by an average of @xmath033  % .",
    "we smooth each galaxy s 70  @xmath4 map with a parameterized kernel and calculate the normalized squared residuals between the smoothed 70  @xmath4 and the 22  cm image as defined by , @xmath7^{2}}{\\sum    r_{j}^2 } ,   \\label{phi}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is used as a normalization factor , @xmath9 represents the infrared image after smearing with kernel of scale - length @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the observed radio image , and the subscript @xmath12 indexes each pixel .",
    "the smoothing kernel takes the form , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the projected , @xmath15-folding length of the kernel ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this kernel was chosen because it works as well as or better than the other kernel types studied by m06 .",
    "we calculate the residuals after first removing pixels detected below the 3  @xmath16 level in either the radio or maximally - smeared infrared maps and editing out contaminating background radio sources .",
    "additional editing was performed in the cases of ngc  3031 and ngc  5194 as described in m06 .",
    "the residuals are plotted against the smearing kernel scale - length in figure [ rescurves ] . to quantify the improvement in the spatial correlation between the 70  @xmath4 and 22  cm maps due to smoothing the 70  @xmath4 image ,",
    "we measure @xmath17 defined as the logarithmic decrement from @xmath18 to @xmath19 at its minimum ; this minimum point defines the best - fit scale length .",
    "since @xmath17 is an estimate of the _ global _ improvement , we also created residual maps , defined by @xmath20 , using the best - fit smearing kernels to determine how well the smearing prescription works for different regions within each galaxy .",
    "the 70  @xmath4 and residual maps are plotted in figure [ resmaps ] .      to see how the fir - radio correlation within galaxies is affected by ongoing star formation activity",
    ", we measure their total infrared ( tir ; 3 - 1100  @xmath4 ) surface brightness and express it as sfr surface density , @xmath21 .",
    "we first create @xmath22 maps via a weighted combination of the 3 mips maps according to equation 4 of @xcite .",
    "the sfr surface densities , in units m@xmath23",
    "yr@xmath24  kpc@xmath25 , were then calculated by estimating a sfr ( i.e. equation 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the tir luminosity within an ellipse fit to the @xmath26  w  m@xmath25  sr@xmath24 isophotal radius , and then dividing by the corresponding deprojected area ( comparable to the galaxy sizes at 70  @xmath4 ) .",
    "in figure [ rescurves ] , we plot the residuals against the smearing scale - length for the sample galaxies , separated into low and high @xmath21 bins .",
    "there is a wide range of behavior in the residual curves among the galaxies .",
    "three galaxies do not display any definitive minimum in their curves .",
    "we also find that galaxies with higher @xmath21 have better defined single minima compared to galaxies with lower @xmath27 even though the distribution of @xmath17 is similar between the two groups .",
    "the smearing technique improves the correlation between the radio and 70  @xmath4 maps by an average of @xmath00.5 in @xmath28 .",
    "this value is 0.3  dex larger than what was found by m06 and is due to improvements in the resolution matching and the larger sample .",
    "we display the 70  @xmath4 and residual maps of each galaxy ordered by @xmath21 in figure [ resmaps ] .",
    "while there appears to be a general correlation between the structure found in the 70  @xmath4 and residual maps , there is a range in the residual map behavior exemplified by the cases of ngc  628 , ngc  5055 , and ngc  6946 . for ngc  5055 , the residuals are small and the image is nearly uniform . in ngc  6946 , on the other hand , we see distinct structures in the residual maps associated with the spiral - arm morphology of the galaxy , as well as a much larger range in the residuals compared to ngc  5055 .",
    "the arms of ngc  6946 display infrared excesses peaked on star - forming regions while the galaxy s inter - arm regions exhibit excess radio emission .",
    "ngc  628 is distinctly opposite to ngc  6946 in its residual map displaying _ radio _ excesses for star - forming regions .",
    "this implies that the large smoothing scale - lengths , which provide the best - fits for low @xmath21 galaxies , oversmooth the active star forming components . in figure [ sfrdleg ]",
    "we plot the best - fit scale - length for each galaxy versus their sfr surface density , @xmath21 .",
    "galaxies are better modeled by larger smearing scale - lengths if their disk - averaged sfr is lower . to ensure that this trend is not an artifact ,",
    "we have compared the best - fit scale - lengths with galaxy distances , linear sizes , and signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios and find a correlation with none of them .",
    "the implications of this trend will be discussed in @xmath29[secdisc ] .",
    "since the image - smearing technique is designed for the physics of non - thermal radio emission , the presence of free - free emission can complicate the interpretation of the best - fit smearing scale - lengths . to gauge the effect of free - free emission on the trend in figure [ sfrdleg ] , we repeat the smearing analysis after subtracting an estimate of the free - free emission distribution using a scaled version of the 24  @xmath4 maps .",
    "the scaling factor was determined by first relating the 24  @xmath4 emission to pa@xmath30 line emission using the correlation found between 24  @xmath4 and pa@xmath30 luminosities within ngc  5194 ( m51a ) @xcite .",
    "although this correlation is not universal @xcite , it should be sufficient for the purpose of roughly estimating how the thermal emission affects the best - fits scale - lengths .",
    "the corresponding pa@xmath30 emission estimate can then be related to an ionizing photon rate @xcite , and the expected free - free emission at 1.4  ghz @xcite .",
    "the final relation is given by , @xmath31 where we have assumed an average h  ii region temperature of @xmath32  k.    for seven of the sample galaxies , @xcite report a mean thermal fraction of @xmath00.08 at 1.0  ghz from radio spectral index fitting .",
    "assuming a mean spectral index of @xmath33 , we obtain a very similar thermal fraction using our data .",
    "since the distribution of free - free emission is clumpy , mostly originating in h  ii regions , we expect that the smearing scale - lengths should increase after it is removed .",
    "the best - fit scale - lengths increase by an average of @xmath025  % .",
    "the slope of the fit using these scale - lengths versus @xmath27 is shallower by @xmath110  % , indicating that the observed trend in figure [ sfrdleg ] can not be suppressed by removing the thermal radio emission .",
    "we have analyzed the effect of star formation intensity on the fir - radio correlation _ within _ galaxies using a phenomenological image - smearing model .",
    "we find that the best - fit scale - length decreases as the star formation activity within each galaxy increases , implying a systematic decrease in the mean distance diffused by cr electrons @xcite .",
    "the measured diffusion scale - lengths can provide independent estimates for the ages of related star formation episodes as well as help constrain interstellar medium ( ism ) parameters associated with the propagation characteristics of cr electrons .",
    "the physical interpretation of our results indicates that cr electrons are , on average , closer to their place of origin in galaxies having higher star formation activity .",
    "since the diffusion scale - length of cr electrons depends only on their age and ability to diffuse through a galaxy s ism , three explanations of the results are possible .",
    "the cr electrons may : ( 1 ) have relatively short lifetimes due to a high energy loss rate ; ( 2 ) diffuse at a slower rate due to the ism having a high density and magnetic field strength , resulting in a shorter mean free path ; or ( 3 ) have been accelerated recently and be relatively young .",
    "the first two of these explanations are applicable in the case of steady - state star formation , while the third requires a recent episode of enhanced star formation .",
    "we will try to distinguish among these three explanations .",
    "as cr electrons propagate through the ism , they lose energy due to synchrotron , inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering , bremsstrahlung , ionization , and adiabatic expansion losses . in normal star - forming galaxies",
    "only the first two mechanisms are significant for cr electrons associated with synchrotron emission at @xmath01  ghz @xcite . assuming an isotropic distribution of electron velocities , the cooling timescale due to synchrotron and ic losses for cr electrons emitting at a frequency @xmath34 , in a magnetic field of strength @xmath35 is , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the magnetic and radiation field energy densities , respectively .    in simple diffusion models ,",
    "the propagation of cr electrons is usually characterized by an empirical energy - dependent diffusion coefficient , @xmath39 , where @xmath40  @xmath41  s@xmath24 for @xmath42  gev and @xmath43  @xmath41  s@xmath24 for @xmath44  gev @xcite . though derived for cr nuclei ,",
    "the above values appear consistent with empirically measured diffusion coefficients for cr electrons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "according to synchrotron theory , cr electrons will emit at @xmath45 thereby allowing @xmath39 to be expressed as a function of @xmath35 for a fixed @xmath34 .",
    "now , assuming that cr electrons diffuse a distance @xmath46 , we can estimate the relative importance of ic losses , ism density ( @xmath47 ) , and @xmath35 on the distance cr electrons travel .",
    "fixing @xmath35 and scaling @xmath48 , we plot the expected relation between @xmath49 and @xmath38 in figure [ sfrdleg ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "this relation has a slope @xmath09 times shallower than a line fit to the data ( dotted line ) .",
    "it is more likely that @xmath47 , @xmath35 , and @xmath38 will all scale together , with a @xmath39 dependence on @xmath47 .",
    "accordingly , we introduce the scaling relations , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are realistic index ranges @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath53 , which has been shown to be valid for a large sample of spirals @xcite , leads to @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and the dependence @xmath56 for the unlikely case that each galaxy takes the extreme values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we obtain the steepest possible index of @xmath59 ( solid line in figure [ sfrdleg ] ) , which is still a factor of @xmath02 times shallower than the line fit to the data .",
    "consequently , differences in the diffusion properties and/or cooling timescales of each galaxy s cr electron population alone ( i.e. the case of steady - state star formation ) , can not explain the observed trend in figure [ sfrdleg ] .    on the other hand , by setting the best - fit scale - lengths equal to @xmath49 and @xmath60 g for each galaxy",
    ", we estimate mean ages ranging from @xmath01.1@xmath61 to @xmath08.3@xmath62  yr for these 1.4  ghz emitting populations of cr electrons . even if we assume @xmath63 , this range of ages shrinks only slightly . while these ages are plausible , spanning nearly 3 orders of magnitude over a factor of 4 change in @xmath21 seems unphysically large .",
    "this suggests that as @xmath21 decreases the best - fit scale - length shifts from being dominated by young cr electrons associated with regions of star formation to being dominated by old cr electrons in the galaxy s underlying disk .",
    "consequently , we conclude that galaxies with higher @xmath21 are likely to have experienced a recent episode of enhanced star formation compared to galaxies with lower disk - averaged sfrs , leading to a larger fraction of relatively young cr electrons within their disks .",
    "we should also note that galaxies with higher star formation activity may also suffer from increased cr electron escape due to instability driven breaks in magnetic field lines @xcite , though characterizing the importance of escape is beyond the scope of this _",
    "letter_. the galaxies analyzed here exhibit a wide range of ages and spreading scale - lengths of their cr electrons , going from the youngest populations , recently injected within star - forming regions ( @xmath64500  pc ) , to the oldest cr electrons , making up a galaxy s underlying synchrotron disk ( @xmath643  kpc ) .",
    "this exponential synchrotron disk results from the superposition of older cr electrons originating from all star - forming regions . in spite of an occasionally dominant mode",
    ", a given galaxy will contain a range of ages for cr electrons , so it is no surprise that a single smoothing kernel can not describe perfectly the relation between infrared and radio disks , as evidenced by the recognizable structure in the residual maps .",
    "ngc  628 , ngc  2403 , ngc  3031 , and ngc  3184 exhibit inflection points in their residual curves which is also suggestive of multiple cr electron populations , possibly from time - separated bursts of star formation .",
    "a more realistic description to account for the range of ages translates into a multiscale analysis of the galaxy images to separate the signatures of various cr electron populations .",
