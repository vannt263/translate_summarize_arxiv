    "the cause of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and the origin of fermion masses are important problems of current particle physics . the standard model ( sm ) accommodates fermion and weak gauge boson masses by including a fundamental weak doublet of scalar higgs bosons .",
    "however , the sm can not explain dynamics responsible for the generation of mass .",
    "furthermore , the scalar sector suffers from the problems of triviality and unnaturalness .",
    "thus , the sm can only be an effective field theory valid below some high energy scale .",
    "topcolor assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) theory @xcite is an attractive scheme in which there is an explicit dynamical mechanism for breaking electroweak symmetry and generating the fermion masses including the heavy top quark mass . in tc2 theory ,",
    "there are no elementary scalar fields and unnatural or excessive fine - tuning of parameters .",
    "thus , tc2 theory is one of the important promising candidates for the mechanism of ewsb .    in tc2 theory@xcite ,",
    "almost all of the top quark mass arises from the topcolor interactions . to maintain electroweak symmetry between top and bottom quarks and yet not generate @xmath11 ,",
    "the topcolor gauge group is usually taken to be a strongly coupled @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 provides the difference that causes only top quark to condense . in order that topcolor interactions be natural , i.e. without introducing large isospin violation ,",
    "it is necessary that ewsb is still mainly generated by technicolor(tc ) interactions . in tc2 theory ,",
    "extended technicolor(etc ) interactions are still needed to generate the masses of light quarks and contribute a few gev to @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this means that the associated top - pions @xmath16 , @xmath17 are not the longitudinal bosons @xmath18 and @xmath19 , but are separately physically observable objects .",
    "thus , tc2 theory predicts a number of pseudo goldstone bosons(pgbs ) including the technipions in the tc sector and the top - pions in the topcolor sector .",
    "these new particles are most directly related to the dynamical symmetry breaking mechanism . thus , studying the production and decay of these new particles at high energy colliders will be of special interest .",
    "the production and decay of the technipions have been extensively studied in ref.[3,4 ] .",
    "the virtual effects of the pgbs(technipions and top - pions ) on the processes such as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 have been discussed in the literatures , where the signatures and observability of these new particles were investigated in hadronic colliders@xcite , @xmath25 colliders@xcite and @xmath26 colliders@xcite . in this paper , we will study the production and decay of the neutral top - pion at high energy @xmath6 colliders(lc ) and discuss the signatures and observability of the neutral top - pion .",
    "the neutral top - pion @xmath27 , as an isospin - triplet , can couple to a pair of gauge bosons through the top quark triangle loop in an isospin violating way similar to the couplings of qcd pion @xmath28 to a pair of gauge bosons .",
    "our results indicate that the main contributions to the production cross section of the neutral top - pion @xmath0 are expected to come from the @xmath7 channel at the lc experiments . in this channel , we find that several hundred events of @xmath0 can be produced per year by assuming an intergrated luminosity @xmath29 .",
    "possibly , a smaller @xmath0 production may also be observed in the @xmath30 channel .    for tc2 theory ,",
    "the underlying interactions , topcolor interactions , are nonuniversal and therefore do not possess a gim mechanism .",
    "this is an essential feature of this kind of models due to the need to single out the top quark for condensation .",
    "this nonuniversal gauge interactions result in flavor changing neutral current(fcnc ) vertices when one writes the interactions in the quark mass eigen - basis .",
    "thus , the top - pions have large yukawa coupling to the third family fermions and induce the new flavor changing scalar couplings including the @xmath31 transitions for the neutral top - pion @xmath0 . within the sm ,",
    "the flavor changing processes are controlled by the scalar sector and the one - loop level fcncs are very small .",
    "thus , we can detect the neutral top - pion via the processes @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "our results show that the production cross sections are significantly large and may be observable in the future lc experiments .    in the rest of this paper , we will give our results in detail .",
    "the couplings of the neutral top - pion @xmath0 to the ordinary particles are discussed in sec.2 , and the decay widths of the relative decay modes are also estimated . in sec.3 , we calculate the production cross sections of the processes @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec.4 .",
    "to solve the phenomenological difficulties of tc theory , tc2 theory@xcite was proposed by combining tc interactions with the topcolor interactions for the third generation at the energy scale of about 1 tev . in tc2 theory ,",
    "the tc interactions play a main role in breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "the etc interactions give rise to the masses of the ordinary fermions including a very small portion of the top quark mass , namely @xmath36 with a model dependent parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the topcolor interactions also make small contributions to the ewsb , and give rise to the main part of the top quark mass , @xmath38 , similar to the constituent masses of the light quarks in qcd .",
    "so , for tc2 theory , there is the following relation : @xmath39 where @xmath40 represents the contributions of the tc interactions to the ewsb , @xmath41 is the top - pion decay constant , and @xmath42 .    for tc2 theory ,",
    "it generally predicts three top - pions with large yukawa couplings to the third generation .",
    "this induces the new flavor changing scalar couplings .",
    "the couplings of the neutral top - pion @xmath0 to the ordinary fermions can be written as@xcite : @xmath43,\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath44 reflects the effect of the mixing between @xmath0 and the would be goldstone boson @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 is the matrix element of the unitary matrix @xmath46 which the ckm matrix can be derived as @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the matrix element of the right - handed relation matrix @xmath49 .",
    "ref.[8 ] has shown that their values can be taken as : @xmath50 if we assume that the part of the top quark mass generated by the topcolor interactions makes up @xmath51 of @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath52 , then we have @xmath53 . in the following calculation",
    ", we will take @xmath52 and @xmath54 as a free parameter .",
    "the coupling of @xmath0 to the bottom quark can be approximately written as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the etc generated part of the bottom - quark mass . according to the idea of tc2 theory , the masses of the first and second generation fermions are also generated by etc interactions .",
    "we have @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "if we take @xmath58 , @xmath59 , then we have @xmath60 .    the couplings of @xmath0 to gauge bosons via the top quark triangle loop are isospin violating similar to the couplings of qcd pion @xmath28 to gauge bosons .",
    "the general form of the effective @xmath61 coupling can be written as @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 represent the field operators of the gauge bosons .",
    "we define @xmath65 to be the strong coupling constant @xmath66 if @xmath67 and @xmath68 are qcd gluons and equal to @xmath69 if @xmath70 and @xmath71 are electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "the anomalous factors @xmath72 are model dependent .",
    "they can be calculated by using the formulas in ref.[11 ] . for the neutral top - pion @xmath27",

    "if we assume that the mass of @xmath0 is in the range of @xmath81@xcite , the possible decay modes of @xmath0 are @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath82 . then we have : @xmath83 using eq.(2)-eq.(9 ) , we can obtain : @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88    since the @xmath89 coupling is very small @xcite , we have assumed @xmath90 in eq.(13 ) . using above equations , we can estimate the branching ratios of the various decay modes of the neutral top - pion @xmath0 . in fig.1 , we plot the resulting branching ratios as a function of @xmath91 for @xmath92",
    ". the branching ratios of anomalous channels @xmath93 and @xmath94 are very small , so we do not give the values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 in fig.1 .",
    "from fig.1 , we can see that the largest branching ratio is that of the decay channel @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath97 branching ratio varies between @xmath98 and @xmath99 for its mass in the range of @xmath100-@xmath101 . for large value of the @xmath0 mass ,",
    "a considerable ratio of the @xmath0 decay mode can also occur in the anomalous channel @xmath102 . for @xmath103",
    ", we have @xmath104 .    to see the effect of the parameter @xmath54 on the branching ratio @xmath105 , we plot @xmath105 versus @xmath54 in fig.2 for @xmath103 .",
    "from fig.2 we can see that @xmath105 is sensitive to the value of parameter @xmath54 . for @xmath106",
    ", we have @xmath107 .",
    "from above discussion , we can see that @xmath3 is one of the dominant decay modes of the neutral top - pion @xmath0 .",
    "this will make @xmath0 observed in the @xmath2 final state at a hadron collider very easy .",
    "ref.[8 ] has extensively studied the signatures of the @xmath0 at the hadron colliders . in this section",
    "we will focus on the @xmath0 production at the high energy @xmath6 colliders(lc ) . in the lc experiments , the @xmath0 production channels",
    "are represented by the processes @xmath108    for the processes in eq.(17 ) , the general form of the total cross section has been given in ref.[12 ] .",
    "for the neutral top - pion @xmath0 , we have assumed that its mass is in the range of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "thus the production cross sections of the processes in eq.(17 ) can be written as : @xmath111,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the center - of - mass energy . using the above equations",
    ", we can calculate the @xmath0 production cross sections via the processes @xmath114 and @xmath8 .",
    "our results are shown in fig.3 as a function of @xmath91 for @xmath115 , @xmath52 . from fig.3",
    ", we can see that the production cross sections increase with decreasing the value of @xmath91 in most of the parameter space and the cross section @xmath116 is larger than the cross section @xmath117 .",
    "however , the cross section @xmath118 increases with increasing the mass @xmath91 for @xmath119 .",
    "the reason is that the factor @xmath120 increases speedily as @xmath78 goes to @xmath121 . for @xmath103 ,",
    "the cross sections are @xmath122 and @xmath123 . to see the effects of the center - of - mass energy @xmath113 on the production cross sections , we plot the cross section @xmath124 versus @xmath113 in fig.4 for @xmath52 and @xmath103 . from fig.4",
    ", we can see that the cross sections increase with increasing the value of @xmath113 . for the process @xmath125 , the cross section increases from @xmath126 to @xmath127 as @xmath113 increases from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "we consider two future @xmath6 collider scenarios : a lc with @xmath115 and a yearly intergrated luminosity of @xmath130 and a lc with @xmath131 and @xmath29 .",
    "the yearly production events can be easily calculated .",
    "our numerical results are shown in table 1 . from table 1",
    "we can see that the neutral top - pion @xmath0 can be significantly produced via the @xmath125 channel at the future high energy @xmath6 colliders . for this channel , several hundred events of @xmath0",
    "can be produced per year which would be observed at the lc experiments , @xmath0 can also be produced via the @xmath132 channel .",
    "several ten events of @xmath0 can be produced per year which may be observed at the lc experiments with @xmath131 .",
    ".the number of @xmath27 produced per year from @xmath133 and @xmath134 at the lc experiments [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the sm , @xmath2 pair production cross sections are unobservably small due to the unitarity of ckm matrix @xcite .",
    "thus , any signal of such @xmath31 transitions will be a clear evidence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "this fact has led to a lot of theoretical activities involving @xmath31 transitions within some specific popular models beyond the sm .",
    "for example , @xmath2 production has been studied in multi higgs doublets models @xcite , in supersymmetry with r - parity violation @xcite , in models with extra vector - like quarks @xcite and model independent@xcite . for tc2 models , we have discussed the contributions of the new gauge bosons and the neutral top - pion @xmath0 to @xmath2 production@xcite . from our discussion in sec.2 , we can see that the @xmath2 mode is one of the dominant decay modes of the neutral top - pion @xmath0 .",
    "thus the new flavor changing scalar coupling @xmath135 may have significant contributions to the processes @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the neutral top - pion @xmath0 may be detected by studying these processes .",
    "since we only consider the real @xmath0 production , the cross sections of the processes @xmath138 and @xmath139 contributed by @xmath0 can be written as : @xmath140 @xmath141 with @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the total decay width of the @xmath0 .",
    "in fig.5 , we plot the cross sections @xmath144 and @xmath145 as a function of the mass @xmath91 for @xmath115 , in which the solid and dotted lines stand for the final states @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively .",
    "from fig.5 we can see that , for @xmath109 , the cross section @xmath144 varies from @xmath148 to @xmath149 and @xmath145 varies from @xmath150 to @xmath151 .",
    "thus , for a lc with @xmath115 , tc2 models predict tens and up to one hundred of @xmath146 raw events , and only few of @xmath147 raw events .",
    "detecting the neutral top - pion @xmath0 is very difficult via the process @xmath137 .",

    "we show the @xmath144 and @xmath145 as a function of @xmath113 for @xmath103 .",
    "same as fig.5 , the solid and dotted lines stand for the final states @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively . from fig.6 , we can see that the cross sections increase with increasing @xmath113 . for a lc with @xmath131 and @xmath29",
    ", there can be about 443 @xmath146 raw events and 95 @xmath147 raw events for @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the neutral top - pion @xmath0 can also be detected via the process @xmath139 at a lc with @xmath131 .",
    "to avoid or solve the problems , such as triviality and unnaturalness arising from the elementary higgs field , various kinds of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking models have been proposed , and among which tc2 theory is one of the important candidates .",
    "tc2 theory predicts the existence of the top - pions .",
    "these new particles are most directly related to the dynamical symmetry breaking mechanism and can be seen as the characteristic feature of tc2 theory .",
    "thus it is of great importance to understand what about the prospects for discovering the top - pions and whether we can study their properties to determine key features and parameters of tc2 theory .    in this paper , we have studied the production and decay of the neutral top - pion @xmath0 at high - energy @xmath6 colliders .",

    "thus , the @xmath0 can be significantly produced at hadronic colliders .",
    "the signatures and observability of the neutral top - pion @xmath0 can be studied at the tevatron .",
    "this is consistent with the results of ref.[8 ] .    except the decay modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the @xmath0 can also decay into @xmath4 and @xmath82 modes .",
