    "in recent years , a brane world scenario has been extensively studied @xcite .",

    "since the schwarzschild radius of particles in the collider becomes smaller than the particle radius , mini black holes could be produced in the accelerators .",
    "if we are able to detect the production and evaporation of black holes , it would be not only the direct evidence for the hawking radiation , but also the stepping stone to a unified theory .",
    "for this reason , the basic study of higher dimensional black holes is now of great importance .",

    "neutral charged black holes are completely specified by their mass and angular momentum , and moreover non spherical topology is forbidden @xcite .",
    "this is the first counterexample that uniqueness theorem does not hold in higher dimensions .",
    "it is then important to examine the property of the black ring and black holes in detail .    in this paper , we focus our attention on the energy extraction by the penrose process @xcite .",
    "using such a formalism , we discuss the efficiency of the energy extraction .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : the geometry of the higher dimensional black holes and black ring is summarized in section [ sec : hdbh ] .",

    "this point gives a lower bound of angular momentum of a black ring .",
    "we also find a similar structure for the horizon area ( entropy)-angular momentum relation ( see fig . 3 in @xcite ) ,",
    "in which we have also a cusp at the same point .",
    "the higher entropy branch should be relatively stable , while the lower entropy branch may be unstable , i.e. it contains at least one unstable mode .",
    "note that the higher rotational energy branch corresponds to the lower entropy branch .",
    "the appearance of such a cusp indicates change of stability .",
    "such a behavior of stability could be understood by a catastrophe theory @xcite .",
    "catastrophe theory is a mathematical tool to explain a change of stability in nature . in some phenomena ,",
    "a state changes discontinuously in spite of a gradual change of the state parameters .",
    "the stability changes of colored black holes , for example , are explained by a catastrophe theory @xcite . the stability analysis via a catastrophe theory seems to have one - one correspondence to the linear perturbations .    to see this",
    "more precisely , we introduce a potential function , which is a functional of a control parameter and a state variable .",
    "we here assume that a control parameter is a radius of a black ring @xmath165 ( this can be driven by solving ( [ eq : brmass ] ) for @xmath166 ) , a state variable is the reduced angular momentum @xmath163 and a potential function is the reduced rotational energy @xmath167 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : catastrophy ] , we depict the equilibrium space @xmath168 . we find that there are two smooth curves : one ( the fine line ) corresponds to a set of black hole solutions and the other ( the solid line ) to that of black rings .",

    "when we compare the rotational energy of a black hole ( @xmath175 ) and that of a black ring in the lower branch ( @xmath176 ) , we find that @xmath177 as a result , a black hole might be unstable for larger angular momentum , while a black ring might be unstable for smaller angular momentum .",
    "one may expect that there is a phase transition from a black ring to a black hole when the object loses its angular momentum .",
    "however , a catastrophe theory can not predict it because two curves in the equilibrium space are connected at a singular point ( @xmath178 ) but not smoothly .",
    "we do not predict any stability for the equilibrium curve with such a singular point in a catastrophe theory . since two objects are topologically different , classical perturbations will also not judge which spacetime is more stable .",
    "we should also mention about gregory - laflamme ( gl ) instability of a black ring @xcite .",
    "when the angular momentum gets large , a ring becomes very thin , which phase corresponds to the lower branch in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] .",
    "then we expect the similar instability to gl instability of a black string @xcite , because in the limit @xmath179 @xcite , a black ring solution approaches a boosted black string solution ( see appendix [ sec : app2 ] ) .",
    "this gl instability seems to be different from the above instability discussed in a catastrophe theory , which we shall call the small entropy ( se ) instability because the smaller horizon area ( entropy ) branch would be unstable .",
    "the upper branch of a black ring is unstable in the sense of se instability , while the lower branch ( at least for large @xmath163 ) becomes unstable in the sense of gl instability .",
    "therefore , it is not so clear what kind of stable configuration is achieved for a black ring .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the energy extraction via the penrose process from higher dimensional black holes and black rings .",
    "the result is that we can extract much more energy from higher dimensional black holes than from 4-dimensional kerr black hole .",
    "although we can gain at most about @xmath117 energy of incident particle in 4-dimensional kerr space - time , the efficiency could be rather amplified in higher dimensions .",
    "in particular , if one rotation parameter vanishes , the maximum efficiency becomes infinitely large because the angular momentum is not bounded from above .",
    "we also apply a catastrophe theory to analyze the stability of black rings .",
    "our analysis indicates a branch of black rings with higher rotational energy is unstable , which should be a different type of instability from the gregory - laflamme s one .",
    "the consequence might enable us to distinguish the 4-dimensional kerr black hole from higher dimensional ones by their energy extraction rates .    however we have to be more careful .",
    "the penrose process tells us only possibility .",
    "if we are interested in the microscopic process such as the hawking evaporation of a black hole or a superradiance , we have to put some field in some background spacetime and then quantize it .",
    "the super - radiant mechanism in the mp black hole has been investigated in @xcite . in the 5-dimensional black hole ,",
    "if one rotation parameter is much smaller ( but not zero ) than the other , superradiant modes play an important role , by which two rotation parameters turn eventually to be almost equal @xcite . for the black hole with the same rotation parameters",
    ", it turns out that the thermal radiation is much important than the superradiance even if the black hole is maximally rotating .",
    "this result would be consistent with our result , i.e. the efficiency of energy extraction can be infinitely large if one rotation parameter is very small , on the other hand it is finite for the case with the same rotation parameters .    as for a black ring , so far we do not know so much .",
    "although the efficiency of energy extraction from a black ring can be infinitely large in the limit @xmath71 ( [ eq : brefficiency ] ) , the effective potential becomes larger and larger in this limit .",
    "when we quantized some field in this background , the particles created by a quantum process may not be able to escape to infinity .",
    "if it is the case , the energy extraction via quantum process is not likely . to evaluate it",
    ", we have to investigate the superradiance and hawking radiation .",
    "the evaporation mechanism and evolution of a black ring would tell us the real conclusion .",
    "however , we have unfortunately not succeeded to separate the variables of geodesic motion and the klein - gordon equation in a black ring space - time .",
    "what we can do so far is to analyze it in the limit of @xmath180 as @xmath181 fixed , which corresponds to a boosted black string spacetime .",
    "we find that no superradiance occurs in this highly rotating spacetime .",
    "the detail is given in appendix [ sec : app2 ] .",
    "this result is again consistent with our result , i.e. the efficiency of a black ring in the small-@xmath182 branch decreases with the angular momentum @xmath73 .",
    "however , the penrose process is still possible because the efficiency reaches some finite constant even when @xmath183    the stability of the black ring as well as higher dimensional rotating black hole , has not yet been established .",
    "only the stability of schwarzschild black hole is proved in higher dimensions as well @xcite .",
    "an interesting thermodynamics approach to stability shows that they are unstable in specific limit @xcite .",
    "a black ring approaches a boosted black string and a rotating black hole with large angular momentum in @xmath22 approaches a black membrane .",
    "black strings and membranes are shown to be unstable @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to perform a stability analysis by the metric perturbations and compare the result with a thermodynamics viewpoint .",
    "as we demonstrated in section [ sec : im ] , the appearance of cusp in fig.[fig : energy ] indicates that there is a stability change at that point via a catastrophe theory .",
    "this shows that a black ring has another unstable mode which is different from the gl instability",
