    "the interaction of a charged particles beam with a plasma is an important subject of relevance for many fields of physics , such as inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) driven by ion or electron beams @xcite , high energy density physics @xcite , and related astrophysical phenomena @xcite .",
    "this interaction is also relevant , among others , for the fast ignition scenario ( fis ) @xcite , where the precompressed deuterium - tritium ( dt ) core of a fusion target is to be ignited by a laser - generated relativistic electron beam .",
    "in addition , a promising icf scheme has been recently proposed @xcite , in which the plasma target is irradiated simultaneously by intense laser and ion beams . within this scheme several experiments @xcite have been performed to investigate the interactions of heavy ion and laser beams with plasma or solid targets .",
    "an important aspect of these experiments is the energy loss measurements for the ions in a wide - range of plasma parameters .",
    "it is expected in such experiments that the ion propagation would be essentially affected by the parametric excitation of the plasma target by means of laser irradiation .",
    "this effect has been supported recently by particle - in - cell numerical simulations @xcite .    motivated by the experimental achievements mentioned above , in this paper we present a study of the effects of intense radiation field ( rf ) on the interaction of projectile particles with an electron plasma .",
    "previously this has been a subject of great activity , starting with the pioneering work of tavdgiridze , aliev , and gorbunov @xcite . more recently",
    "the need of the comprehensive analysis of the complexity of the beam - matter interaction in the presence of strong laser fields has stimulated a number of theoretical studies .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have developed a time - dependent hamiltonian formulation to describe the effect of a strong laser field on energy losses of swift ions moving in a degenerate electron gas .",
    "it has been shown that the energy loss is reduced for ions at intermediate velocities , but is increased for slow ions , due to a resonance process of plasmon excitation in the target assisted by a photon absorption @xcite . for plasma targets , on the other hand",
    ", it has been obtained that the energy loss is reduced in the presence of a laser field when the projectile velocity is smaller than the electron thermal velocity @xcite .",
    "moreover , the reduction of the energy loss rate increases with decreasing the angle between the projectile velocity and the polarization vector of the laser field @xcite .",
    "next , an interesting effect has been obtained by @xcite considering the oscillatory motion of the light projectile particles in the laser field . in this case",
    "the energy loss depends on the projectile charge sign and mass and , therefore , results in a different stopping powers for electrons and positrons . in recent years",
    "special attention has been also paid to the regimes of high intensities of the laser field when the quiver velocity of the plasma electron exceeds the projectile velocity @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the projectile particles can be even accelerated in a plasma due to the parametric effects excited by an intense laser field .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have studied the influence of a high - intensity laser field on the coulomb explosion and stopping power for a swift h@xmath3 cluster ion in a plasma target .",
    "they have demonstrated that the laser field affects the correlation between the ions and contributes to weaken the wake effect as compared to the laser - free case .",
    "all papers mentioned above deal with a nonrelativistic projectile particles interacting with a laser irradiated plasma . in the present paper we study more general configurations thus considering the interaction of relativistic particles with an electron plasma .",
    "our objective is then to study some aspects of the energy loss of relativistic particles which have not been considered previously . as an important motivation of the present paper is the research on the topic of the fis for inertial confinement fusion",
    "@xcite which involves the interaction of a laser - generated relativistic electron beam ( reb ) with a plasma .",
    "although the concept of the fis implies an overdense plasma and the propagation of a relativistic electron beam from the border of a precompressed target to the dense core occurs without crossing the laser beam , the target plasma is assumed to be parametrically excited by the rf through high - harmonics generation .",
    "in this situation , the presence of the rf as well as the relativistic effects of the beam can dramatically change the main features of the standard stopping capabilities of the plasma .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we outline the theoretical formalism for the electromagnetic response of a plasma due to the motion of a relativistic charged particles beam in a plasma in the presence of an intense rf .",
    "the stopping of the relativistic beam is formulated in section  [ sec:3 ] . in this section",
    "we calculate the effects of the rf on the mean energy loss ( stopping power ) of the test particle considering two somewhat distinct cases with a weak ( sec .",
    "[ sec:3 - 1 ] ) and intense ( sec .",
    "[ sec:3 - 2 ] ) radiation field as well as a wide range for the test particle energies , extending from nonrelativistic up to the ultrarelativistic energies .",
    "the dynamics of the electron plasma is treated by a system of fluid equations which results in a high - frequency approximation for the dielectric response function .",
    "the results are summarized in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the whole interaction process of the relativistic charged particles beam with plasma involves the energy loss and the charge states of the projectile particle and  as an additional aspect  the ionization and recombination of the projectile driven by the rf and the collisions with the plasma particles .",
    "a complete description of the interaction of the beam requires a simultaneous treatment of all these effects including , in particular , in the case of the structured particles the effect of the charge equilibration on the energy loss process . in this paper",
    ", we do not discuss the charge state evolution of the projectiles under study , but concentrate on the rf effects on the energy loss process assuming an equilibrium charge state of the projectile particle with an effective charge @xmath4 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the charge equilibration occurs in time scales , which are usually much smaller than the time of passage of the beam through target .",
    "in addition , the effects mentioned above are not important in the case of the relativistic electron beams .",
    "the problem is formulated using the hydrodynamic model of the plasma and includes the effects of the rf in a self - consistent way .",
    "the external rf is treated in the long - wavelength limit , and the plasma electrons are considered nonrelativistic .",
    "these are good approximations provided that ( i ) the wavelength of the rf ( @xmath5 ) is much larger than the debye screening length @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 the thermal velocity of the electrons and @xmath8 the plasma frequency ) , and ( ii ) the quiver velocity  of the electrons in the rf @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the amplitude of the rf ) is much smaller than the speed of light @xmath11 .",
    "these conditions can be alternatively written as ( i ) @xmath12 , and ( ii ) @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the intensity of the rf . as an estimate in the case of a dense plasma , with electron density @xmath15  @xmath16 , we get @xmath17  w/@xmath18 . thus the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are well above the values obtained with currently available high - power sources of the rf , and these approximations are well justified .",
    "the response of the plasma to the incoming relativistic beam is governed by the hydrodynamic equations for the density @xmath19 and the velocity @xmath20 of the plasma electrons as well as by the maxwell equations for the electromagnetic fields .",
    "thus , @xmath21 \\right ] ,   \\label{eq:2}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath22 is the rf , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the self - consistent electromagnetic fields which are determined by the maxwell equations , @xmath25here @xmath26 is the induced current density , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the charge and current densities for the beam , respectively , @xmath29 is the equilibrium plasma density in an unperturbed state .",
    "as mentioned above we consider a relativistic beam of charged particles and , therefore , the influence of the rf @xmath30 on the beam is ignored .",
    "consider now the solution of eqs .  - for the beam - plasma system in the presence of the high - frequency rf . in an unperturbed state ( i.e. , neglecting the self - consistent electromagnetic fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 in eq .   and assuming the homogeneous initial state ) the plasma velocity satisfies the equation @xmath31 which yields the equilibrium velocity for the plasma electrons , @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are the quiver velocity and the oscillation amplitude of the plasma electrons , respectively , driven by the rf .",
    "next we consider the linearized hydrodynamic and maxwell s equations for the plasma and electromagnetic fields , respectively . for sufficiently small perturbations ,",
    "we assume @xmath35 , @xmath36 , ( with @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",

    "in this case the solution of eq .   is trivial and it is given by @xmath85 .",

    "for this purpose we insert the last expression into the second term of the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "then it is straightforward to see that this term corresponds to the erenkov radiation ( or absorbtion ) in a plasma by a moving charged particles beam .",
    "note that this effect is absent in the field - free case since the physical conditions of the erenkov radiation can not be fulfilled in this case .",
    "thus the rf essentially changes the dispersion properties of the plasma and the erenkov effect becomes now possible .",
    "in particular , an inspection of a general expression shows that in a long wavelength limit the emission of the transverse electromagnetic waves occurs at the frequencies @xmath86 for @xmath87 ( emission ) , and at @xmath88 for @xmath89 ( absorbtion ) , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the relativistic factor and the velocity of the beam , respectively .",

    "is of the order of @xmath92 and the neglect of the second term in eq .",
    "is justified at the high - frequencies of the rf ( @xmath93 ) . in the next sections",
    "the further calculations will be done using the approximate expression .    before closing this section",
    "let us consider briefly some limiting cases of eq .  .",
    "for instance , in the electrostatic limit ( assuming that @xmath94 ) from eq .   one obtains @xmath95which confirms eq .  .",
    "in the limit of the vanishing radiation field with @xmath96 , eq .",
    "yields @xmath97 , where @xmath98 .",
    "\\label{eq:26}\\]]it is seen that in the last expression @xmath99 is the fourier transform of the electric field created in a medium by an external charge with the density @xmath100 and current @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "with the basic results presented in the previous sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we now take up the main topic of this paper , namely the investigation of the stopping power of a relativistic charged particle beam in a plasma irradiated by an intense laser field . for further progress the charge and current densities of the beam in eq .   should be specified .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that these quantities are given functions of the coordinates and time .",
    "in particular , for a beam of charged particles having a total charge @xmath4 and moving with a constant velocity @xmath101 , the charge and current densities are determined by @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "here @xmath104 is the spatial distribution of the charge in the beam with the normalization @xmath105 .",
    "accordingly , the fourier transforms of these quantities are @xmath106q(\\mathbf{k})\\delta ( \\omega -\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{u})$ ] , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 is the fourier transform of the distribution @xmath104 ( form - factor of the beam ) .",
    "note that @xmath108 is normalized in a such way that @xmath109 .",
    "in particular , for the gaussian beam with a charge distribution @xmath110 , we obtain @xmath111 . here",
    "@xmath112 and @xmath113 are the characteristic sizes of the beam along and transverse to the direction of motion , respectively .    from eqs .",
    "and it is straightforward to calculate the time average ( with respect to the period @xmath114 of the laser field ) of the stopping field acting on the beam .",
    "then , the averaged stopping power ( sp ) of the beam becomes @xmath115 \\frac{(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\mathbf{a})}{c^{2}\\zeta } \\right ] \\right\\ } ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath116 and @xmath90 is the relativistic factor of the beam . in eq .",
    "the symbol @xmath117 denotes an average with respect to the period of the laser field .",
    "hence , the sp depends on the beam velocity @xmath101 , the frequency @xmath118 and the intensity @xmath119 of the rf ( the intensity dependence is given through the quiver amplitude @xmath120 ) . moreover , since the vector @xmath121 in eq .",
    "is integrated over the angular variables , @xmath122 becomes also a function of the angle @xmath123 between the velocity @xmath101 , and the direction of rf polarization , represented by @xmath120 .",
    "in addition , it is well known that within classical description an upper cut - off parameter @xmath124 ( where @xmath125 is the effective minimum impact parameter or the distance of closest approach ) must be introduced in eq .   to avoid the logarithmic divergence at large @xmath126 .",
    "this divergence corresponds to the incapability of the classical perturbation theory to treat close encounters between the projectile particles and the plasma electrons properly . for @xmath125 ,",
    "we use the effective minimum impact parameter excluding hard coulomb collisions with a scattering angle larger than @xmath127 .",
    "the resulting cut - off parameter @xmath128 is well known for energy loss calculations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "here @xmath7 is the thermal velocity of the electrons .",
    "in particular , at high - velocities this cut - off parameter reads as @xmath129 .",
    "when , however , @xmath130 , the de broglie wavelength exceeds the classical distance of closest approach . under these circumstances",
    "we choose @xmath131 .",
    "equation   contains two types of the contributions .",
    "the first one is proportional to the imaginary part of the inverse of the longitudinal dielectric function @xmath132 and is the energy loss of the beam due to the excitations of the longitudinal plasma modes .",
    "the second contribution comes from the imaginary part of @xmath133^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath134 has been introduced above and determines the energy loss of the beam due to the excitations of the transverse plasma modes .",

    "neglecting such terms we finally arrive at @xmath139 \\delta \\left ( \\varepsilon ( \\omega _ { \\ell } ) \\right ) .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the energy loss of a relativistic charged particles beam moving in a laser irradiated plasma , where the laser field has been treated in the long - wavelength approximation .",
    "the dynamics of the beam - plasma system in the presence of the rf is studied by the linearized fluid and maxwell equations for the plasma particles and the electromagnetic fields , respectively .",
    "the full electromagnetic response of the system is derived involving all harmonics of the rf .",
    "it has been shown that , in general , the excited longitudinal and transversal modes are parametrically coupled due to the presence of the rf . as a result , the erenkov radiation by the charged particles beam , which is absent in a plasma in the field - free case , becomes possible .",
    "however , in contrast to the usual erenkov effect in a laser - free medium , the spectrum of the radiation in the present case is discrete and the emitted frequencies are localized around the harmonics of the rf depending essentially on the energy of the incoming beam . in particular , at ultrarelativistic energies of the beam emitted frequencies are shifted towards higher harmonics of the rf .    in the course of our study",

    "the sp in a laser irradiated plasma is completely determined by the dielectric function of the plasma which in the present context is given by the hydrodynamic approximation . explicit calculations have been done for two particular cases assuming ( i ) a low - intensity laser field but arbitrary orientation of the laser polarization vector @xmath10 with respect to the charged particles beam velocity @xmath101 , and ( ii ) an arbitrary ( but nonrelativistic ) intensity of the laser field when @xmath10 is parallel to @xmath101 . in the case",
    "( i ) it has been shown that the rf increases the sp for small angles between the velocity of the beam and @xmath10 while decreasing it at large angles .",
    "furthermore , the relative deviation of the sp from the field - free value is strongly reduced with increasing the beam energy . in the case ( ii ) and at high - intensities of the rf",
    "two extrem regimes have been distinguished when the excited harmonics cancel effectively each other reducing strongly the energy loss or increasing it due to the constructive interference . as in the previous nonrelativistic treatments @xcite an acceleration of the projectile particle",
    "is expected at high - intensities of the rf when the quiver velocity of the plasma electrons exceeds the beam velocity @xmath91 .",
    "special attention has been paid to the relativistic effects of the beam .",
    "we have demonstrated that in general the energy loss increases with the beam energy forming a maximum at moderate relativistic factors @xmath254 which , however , are shifted towards higher energies of the beam with the laser intensity .",
    "in addition , the enhancement of the sp is more pronounced when the laser frequency approaches the plasma frequency in agreement with pic simulations @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been also shown that the sp of the ultrarelativistic electron beam increases systematically with the intensity of the rf exceeding essentially the field - free sp .",
    "going beyond the present model , which is based on several approximations , we can envisage a number of improvements .",

    "<S> in particular , it has been shown that the weak rf increases the mean energy loss for small angles between the velocity of the reb and the direction of polarization of the rf while decreasing it at large angles . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the relative deviation of the energy loss from the field - free value is strongly reduced with increasing the beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> special case of the parallel orientation of the polarization of the rf with respect to the beam velocity has been also considered . at high - intensities of the rf </S>",
    "<S> two extreme regimes have been distinguished when the excited harmonics cancel effectively each other reducing strongly the energy loss or increasing it due to the constructive interference . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it has been demonstrated that the energy loss of the ultrarelativistic electron beam increases systematically with the intensity of the rf exceeding essentially the field - free value .    </S>",
