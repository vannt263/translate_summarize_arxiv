    "we now restrict the system basis to the single excitation subspace .",
    "these excitations can be photonic or atomic , that is @xmath31 or @xmath32 , respectively , where @xmath33 specifies the cavity . as such ,",
    "the full system state is written as a tensor product of every single cavity state , where one excitation must be conserved ( the other non - excited cavities are in the @xmath34 state ) , so the hilbert space has @xmath35 dimensions . in such basis , the matrix form of the hamiltonian ( [ jchhamilt ] ) can be simply expressed by @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the detuning between photonic and atomic modes , @xmath38 is the @xmath39 identity matrix , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the usual pauli matrices , and @xmath42 the adjacency matrix .",

    "the an does not take geometrical deformations into account so we are only interested in the connections between the nodes . by considering uniform inter - cavity coupling , the adjacency matrix @xmath42 for @xmath4 , for example , can be written by @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in order to discuss our results in the following sections , we need the appropriate identification of each node ( cavity ) , then fig .",

    "the first generation is made up by nodes 1 to 4 , the second one includes 5 to 7 , the third , 8 to 16 , and the fourth , 17 to 43 .",
    "the corner nodes were drawn bigger for a clearer visualization .",
    "this is the node labelling we will adopt through the paper.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the jch model eigenstates are known as polaritons , superposition of atomic and photonic excitations over the entire lattice . as we are considering the single excitation subspace ,",
    "the polaritons are linear combinations written on the @xmath46 basis , as seen in the last section .",
    "the an topology induces both localized and extended eigenstates , and its spectrum is characterized by several regions , some of these with a high degree of degeneracy due to the node degree distribution ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "such configuration drastically changes the the way atomic and photonic degrees of freedom relate with each other for specific sets of parameters , comparing to the jch model defined in regular lattices .",
    "hence , in order to get an idea of the form such polaritons will take , we shall provide a brief description of the free - field hamiltonian , @xmath47 normal frequency spectrum and eigenstates on the single photon basis .",
    "we solve the above hamiltonian by numerical diagonalization . in order to characterize the degree of localization of such eigenstates we evaluate the participation ratio , defined as @xmath48 for a given an generation @xmath29 , where @xmath49 represents an eigenstate and @xmath50 a single photon located at node @xmath21 .",
    "this quantity can assume values within @xmath51 , for completely localized states , and @xmath0 , for extended states ( @xmath52 for all @xmath21 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) we compare the participation ratio with the node coefficient amplitudes , @xmath53 , for different @xmath21 s on the 4th generation an .",

    "( b ) the field normal mode frequency band ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the eigenstates are labelled according to increasing values of @xmath54 ( in units of @xmath27 ) and , within each degenerate group , by increasing values of @xmath56.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    firstly , notice that the hub node @xmath60 , with degree @xmath61 , has its largest amplitude in the most localized eigenstate , @xmath62 , corresponding to the frequency @xmath63 , which is non - degenerate . from now on , we call it @xmath64 . for the other nodes , @xmath65 , 8 , and 18 , representing the @xmath66 , 6 , and 3 group , respectively ,",
    "more eigenstates get involved but there is still a peak over a reasonable localized eigenstate .",
    "it turns out that a similar distribution occurs for every node @xmath21 , with different localization strengths , not necessarily scaling with @xmath8 , although the hub node localized eigenstate will always be paramount , regardless of the network size .",
    "moreover , even within a node group sharing the same @xmath8 , there can be a difference in such localization strengths , since there can be many symmetry groups in it ( the an has a @xmath67 rotational symmetry ) .",
    "anyway , what is most relevant to be addressed here is that , apart from the hub node localized eigenstate that corresponds to a non - degenerate frequency @xmath64 , every node has a ( not solely ) related localized eigenstate associated with a degenerate frequency level ( @xmath68 ) depending on @xmath8 ( higher frequencies are associated with higher @xmath8 values ) . by looking at figs . [ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) we can identify the level @xmath69 as being related to the @xmath70 group ( nodes 17 to 43 ) , for instance . frequencies below this value comprise extended eigenstates mostly .",
    "although we have only discussed the @xmath45 an spectrum properties , the an structure presents self - similarity as the generation increases and thus it reflects on its properties .",
    "these spectrum regions containing strongly localized eigenstates for a given @xmath8 yield to attractive features when we consider the full jch hamiltonian as we are going to show in the next section .",
    "further details about localized and extended states on the an and its relationship with the structure size and characteristic spectrum , for a similar tight - binding hamiltonian , can be found in ref .",
    "in this section we display the results for time evolution of the jch model arranged on the considered an .",
    "the system eigenstates @xmath71 ( polaritons ) and its corresponding eigenvalues @xmath72 were evaluated by means of numerical diagonalization of hamiltonian ( [ hamilt1exc ] ) . for an initial state of the form @xmath73 fully localized at node ( cavity ) @xmath74 , we discuss the system dynamics for different energy regimes .",
    "the state at time @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the quantum time evolution operator .",
    "we are primarily interested on the single excitation propagation dynamics .",

    "firstly , we investigate the strong hopping regime , @xmath84 . in this case , the existence of discrete field normal mode frequencies along with strongly localized eigenstates brings an interesting feature : a jc - like interaction between the field normal mode and its atomic analog occur for an appropriate tuning of the atomic transition frequency , @xmath23 , regardless of the system size @xcite , since the an maintain its spectrum pattern as the generation increases .",
    "it means that the atomic component still can propagate ( in a time scale of the order of @xmath22 ) even in such a regime where the atom - field interaction rate is much slower than the photon inter - cavity hopping .",
    "this property comes from the fact that , as long as the single cavity parameters are uniform through the lattice and the decoupling of the hopping hamiltonian in terms of normal modes is known , the jch hamiltonian can be rearranged into a sum of decoupled jc models , each coupling a field normal mode to its atomic counterpart @xcite .",

    "a pair of such polaritons starts to overlap with both components , by a similar way as the single cavity jc model eigenstates @xcite except that , in the jch model , it extends over the entire network .",
    "if the field normal mode frequency happens to be @xmath29-fold degenerate , then @xmath29 pairs of polaritons get involved in such process .",
    "although in this case there is no jc - like interaction exclusively between one field normal mode and its atomic analog , a significant energy transfer between atomic and photonic degrees of freedom might still occur as long as a pair of localized jc - like polaritons is available and we set the appropriate initial state . in order to highlight these phenomena , mainly to address the amount of energy that can be exchanged between atomic and photonic components , for given initial conditions",
    ", we shall start the system with a fully localized atomic state .",
    "as such , we induce the system dynamics to be generated only by those jc - like polaritons , for the given atomic frequency , and thus the photonic component does not propagate freely . in figs . [ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) we show the overall photonic ( atomic ) occupation probability , @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , when the system starts with an atomic excitation at nodes 4 ( hub node ) and 18 , respectively .",
    "the atomic frequency @xmath23 was set to @xmath64 in order to simulate the dynamics of the jc - like polaritons strongly localized at the hub node .",
    "observe that a significant atom - field interaction happens only when the atomic excitation is initially present at such node . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show how the process takes place in a detailed way .",
    "the initial concentrated atomic energy is progressively converted into field modes ( mostly at node 4 ) and it reaches the other cavities as well .",
    "right after the field modes reach its maximum , it releases energy until the point that the system is fully atomic again , but the excitation is delocalized instead of being fully localized at the initial node .",
    "then a reverse process occur , i.e. , the field modes retrieve the same amount of energy and transfer all of it to the node 4 in the form of atomic excitation , thus recovering the initial state . as long as @xmath94 is high enough and @xmath23",
    "is precisely adjusted to the discrete field normal mode frequency , the same behavior occurs cyclically . in figs .",
    "[ fig4](c ) and [ fig4](d ) , the atomic frequency matches with the degenerate field normal mode frequency level comprising every localized polariton associated to the @xmath95 node group .",
    "in this case , as we prepare the atomic excitation at node 4 , it freezes [ fig . [ fig4](c ) ] , indicating that the overlap between this node and every involved jc - like polaritons is minimum .",
    "the same does not applies to node 18 and thus a considerable atom - photon interaction is triggered [ fig . [ fig4](d ) ] .",
    "even though now there are many polaritons taking part on the dynamics ( as the discrete field normal mode frequency level is degenerated ) , the atom - field interaction occurs in a similar way as in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , since most of the contribution comes from the localized polaritons .",
    "thus , despite of the degeneracy degree of a discrete field normal mode frequency level , we can assert that the overlap between the involved jc - like polaritons and the initial state dictates the amount of energy in which can be exchanged .",
    "this property is still valid for large - size networks since the an field normal frequency band is characteristically gapped for any generation . observe that , in principle , such effective jc interaction is possible in small regular clusters with uniform hopping rates , for instance .",
    "however , as we increase its size , the field normal spectrum tends to a continuum thus making an accurate resonance not achievable anymore .",
    "in addition , the involved polaritons become even more extended . therefore",
    ", it does not matter in which node we set the initial state , the atomic component becomes practically frozen @xcite .",
    "let us now consider an initial state of the form @xmath96 which is a jc model single cavity eigenstate @xcite . in this case , the whole frequency band is available for the photonic mode propagation while the atomic mode behavior depends on the atomic frequency @xmath23 , in a similar way as in the previous discussion where the initial state was fully atomic .",
    "thus , the photonic mode describes a quantum walk through the network @xcite while the atom - field interaction takes place in a much longer time scale , since @xmath84 .",
    "obviously , the latter is only possible if the atomic frequency matches with any of the field normal mode frequencies .",
    "anyway , regardless of @xmath23 , in this case the photonic mode propagates practically free without being disturbed by the atom - field interaction .",
    "hence , in the remaining of this section we discuss the quantum transport properties of the photonic excitation on the an .",
    "firstly , observe that the an has a @xmath67 rotational symmetry , thus there are several subsets of equivalent nodes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) like @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and so forth , in which @xmath78 would lead to the same dynamics .",
    "likewise , for the initial state set at the hub node ( @xmath100 ) , the occupation probabilities @xmath101 are equal for each subset .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] show the time evolution of the photonic occupation probability for different initial single cavity states on the @xmath102 and @xmath45 an , respectively .",

    "although exhibiting a rather complex dynamics , we can identify some general aspects of the propagation .",
    "the most remarkable feature is periodic transition between localized and extended states .",
    "the return probability @xmath108 can reach the highest values so that the excitation is most likely to be found in the initial node .",
    "this is expected due to the existence of many localized eigenstates , as discussed in sec .",
    "this localization is stronger for @xmath100 , the hub node .",
    "now let us turn our attention to the probability of finding the excitation in nodes other than the initial one . in general ,",
    "such probabilities are very small compared to @xmath109 , although these can reach relevant values in some specific nodes .",
    "the probability distribution strongly depends on the given an generation and the initial conditions . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , by examining @xmath110 for @xmath105 , we see that a significant amount of probability flows to the other nodes belonging to the same degree group , that is , nodes 1 and 2 . the same applies to @xmath111 and @xmath112 when @xmath107 . for @xmath113 ,",
    "the nodes 10 and 11 , even belonging to the same degree group , are barely populated .",
    "it suggests that sharing the same degree does not necessarily imply in privileged networking .",
    "it turns clearer in fig .",

    "when @xmath107 for @xmath45 , the excitation still roams between nodes 6 and 7 , but now avoiding transport to higher generation nodes . for @xmath113 , there is a relevant probability of finding the excitation at nodes 20 , 21 , and 22 .",
    "these nodes belong to the subnetwork formed by nodes 1 , 2 , and 5 , where node 15 plays the role of hub node .",
    "these observations indicate that these subnetworks have a fundamental part on the system transport dynamics for higher an generations .",
    "a better way to visualize how the excitation probability is distributed among the nodes for given initial conditions is by evaluating the long time average of @xmath115 , defined as @xmath116 where @xmath117 for @xmath118 and @xmath119 else .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the distribution of this average for different an generations .",
    "first of all , notice that @xmath120 for every @xmath74 and @xmath81 ( since the evolution is unitary ) , hence this quantity provides us a clearer view on the way the nodes establish communication channels with each other .",
    "as it must be , the higher averages are @xmath121 , however , by looking at the other connections we can identify several zones ( square boundaries ) and branches apart which , interestingly , present self - similarity as @xmath29 increases .",
    "the branches connect generations with each other while the zones connect nodes from the same generation , i.e. , with same degree @xmath8 .",
    "the strongest ( darkest ) branch is always the one connecting nodes from the current generation to the previous one .",
    "it mostly represents the links between the corresponding hub nodes from the @xmath122 subnetworks having 7 nodes , to its three nearest - neighbour nodes with @xmath70 . as @xmath29 increases , the previous branches still remain but with lower intensities since the aforementioned hub nodes now have a higher @xmath8 .",
    "also , nodes from `` distant '' generations seem to be barely connected and links between nodes from the same generation are only relevant within subnetworks composed by 16 nodes at most . for instance",
    ", at a given generation @xmath29 , there are @xmath123 subnetworks having @xmath124 nodes .",
    "further , these degree interconnections also become weaker as generation increases .      in what follows",
    "we consider the situation where the hopping rate and the atom - field coupling strength are of the same order : the jch regime ( @xmath125 ) . in this case",
    "the dynamics is nontrivial since neither there is a jc - like interaction between photonic and atomic components nor the photonic mode describes a quantum walk on the an , as we have just seen for the strong hopping regime . instead",
    ", somehow both degrees of freedom start to interfere with each other .    at the strong hopping regime it is possible to drive the atomic frequency ( comprising a set of denegerate eigenvalues ) along the jch spectrum thus creating jc - like polaritons .",
    "otherwise we have well defined photonic- and atomic - like polaritons .",
    "once the atom - field coupling parameter is raised , such effective resonance is no longer feasible . in other words , at the jch regime it is not possible to generate a jc - like interaction without disturb other polaritons associated with different frequency levels on the jch spectrum , within a range compatible with the @xmath94 value .",
    "thus , the excitation roams between photonic and atomic degrees of freedom while it propagates through the network in a rather complex way .",
    "it turns out that each cavity provides its contribution mostly to one of these two components , depending on the detuning and the system initial conditions .",
    "hence , an initial state like @xmath126 will not maintain the even superposition between the whole photonic and atomic parts of the system , as in the strong hopping case .",
    "due to the existence of strongly localized polaritons , we must expect that the detuning and the initial state will be crucial in driving the whole system among both degrees of freedom .",
    "[ fig9 ] describes how the initial state significantly changes the way each cavity contributes to each one of the components , at the jch regime . in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) we show the long time average occupation probability distribution @xmath127 when the single cavity state is set at the hub node , @xmath100 .",
    "notice that @xmath128 can be evaluated by the same way as eq .",
    "[ eqlongtime ] by projecting the eigenstates on @xmath129 , instead of @xmath130 .",
    "we can see that some groups of nodes have higher @xmath131 values ( including the hub node ) , others mostly contribute to @xmath132 , and a few practically remains even for both components . in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) we plot the overall photonic ( atomic ) occupation probability , @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the whole system notoriously fluctuates between both components , mainly due to large shift between @xmath133 and @xmath134 plus the fact that the polaritons leading the dynamics are strongly localized",
    ". figs . [ fig9](c ) and [ fig9](d ) show the same quantities but now for @xmath114 ( @xmath95 ) . recall that , as @xmath106 , several pairs of localized jc - like polaritons related to every node with @xmath95 are involved thus keeping @xmath135 and @xmath136 practically the same .",
    "however , even with a jc - like dynamics taking place , thus resulting in a small variation of the overall occupation probability , other polaritons are involved , hence shifting the average for the rest of the cavities .",
    "such nontrivial features arising from the jch regime fade out if we keep on raising the atom - field coupling strength until @xmath137 . in this regime ,",
    "the dynamics for both atomic and photonic modes behaves exactly like at the large hopping regime but now creating new single cavity eigenstates ( if @xmath126 ) , as passing by other cavities , and propagating at half the speed of the photonic excitation at the @xmath84 regime @xcite .",
    "it turns out to be expected , from the fact that , as @xmath94 decreases , more jc - like pairs of polaritons are created until the entire jch spectrum is affected .",
    "we now provide a review of the main features provided by the different energy regimes , as previously discussed .",
    "although we have dealt with the jch dynamics on the an , these properties apply for any structure .",
    "the main difference lies on the existence of a gapped spectrum and localized eigenstates , and also whether or not it holds for a large - size system .    in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we outline the energy regime transition from @xmath138 to @xmath139 by evaluating the time evolution of the photonic [ fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) ] and atomic [ fig .",
    "[ fig10](b ) ] return probabilities @xmath140 for a single cavity initial state , eq .",
    "( [ scstate ] ) . at the strong hopping regime , @xmath84 ,",
    "the interaction between photonic and atomic components occurs in a time scale much longer than the photon hopping .",
    "it means that , in a single cavity initial state , the whole system remains in an even superposition between both components .",
    "as the single photon describes a quantum walk through the network , the atom - field coupling does not interfere on it , practically .",
    "moreover , the atomic dynamics will be restricted to a single or a set of jc - like pair of polaritons ( if the corresponding energy level is degenerate ) , or none , if the atomic frequency @xmath23 does not match with any field normal mode frequency .",
    "the latter case obviously implies in the atomic freezing . on the contrary , a jc - like pair ( or pairs ) of polaritons",
    "might be created and , if it happens that it is strongly localized at some node , by setting the appropriate initial state , a significant atom - field energy exchange takes place ( in a time scale of the order of @xmath22 ) , as described in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , where we have considered a fully atomic initial state in order to highlight the phenomena .",
    "we have also analysed the quantum transport properties of the an .",
    "the excitation is most likely to be found at the initial node , as expected . by evaluating the long time average photonic occupation probability for different an generations",
    ", we have discussed the interplay between the nodes and subnetworks thus showing their role on the system dynamics . at a given generation @xmath29 ,",
    "the nodes with @xmath95 are mostly connected with its correspondent hub node from the previous generation and with some other nodes having the same degree within local subnetworks .",
    "furthermore , these properties hold recurrently as we increase the network size ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the jch regime , @xmath125 , is characterized by a polariton interference which leads the system to roam between photonic and atomic degrees of freedom in a nontrivial way .",
    "the dynamics is neither strictly ruled by jc - like pairs of polaritons nor the photonic mode propagates freely . instead , for a given detuning , even if jc - like pairs of polaritons are set , other polaritons associated with different frequency levels on the jch spectrum now contribute to the dynamics .",
    "it generates a splitting between photonic and atomic average occupation ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) within each cavity .",
    "such deviation can be avoided ( at least in a particular cavity ) by setting an appropriate atomic frequency in order to create a pair of jc - like polaritons strongly localized at the initial node .",
    "the strong atom - field coupling regime , @xmath141 , is reached by the time such polariton interference is so robust that every field normal mode becomes coupled to its atomic analog and hence the photonic and atomic excitation propagate coherently through the network .",
    "even at the single excitation subspace , the jch model provides a rich dynamics .",
    "moreover , the an induces a peculiar spectrum and set of strongly localized eigenstates due solely to its topology , as we have considered uniform coupling parameters over the network .",
    "the structure self - similarity naturally reflects on the jch model dynamics . as a result",
    ", the atomic excitation might not be stationary at the strong hopping regime even for large - size networks .",
    "another appealing feature is the possibility of driving a specific set of polaritons to rule the dynamics , by a judicious tuning of the atomic transition frequency .",
    "we have also discussed the continuous time quantum walk on the an for different system sizes . for any initial state ( fully localized at a specific node )",
    ", the system will always carry a large amount of information about its initial conditions and will significantly propagate to a small set of nodes only .",
    "further work along this direction should also consider other kinds of initial states , other than localized , where a much more complex dynamics arise .",
    "even though high - fidelity excitation transport protocols in an one - dimensional array of coupled cavities have been proposed @xcite , such regular structures induce mostly extended polaritons , which do not highlight all the features the single excitation jch model can provide , in contrast to non - conventional complex structures , where , aside from the jch model , might also shed light in the behavior of other many - body systems .",
