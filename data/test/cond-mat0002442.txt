    "the itinerant ferromagnetism has been one of the most fundamental problems in condensed matter physics , and we are still some way from a full understanding of the problem . for the ferromagnetism in the hubbard model , a simplest possible model for interacting itinerant electrons , there are various studies , which are pioneered by gutzwiller@xcite , hubbard@xcite , and kanamori@xcite . for the hubbard model on finite - size systems",
    ", it recently extended to rigorous proofs that spin - independent coulomb interaction can indeed result in fully - polarized ferromagnetic ground states without degeneracy for appropriate conditions and/or appropriate models@xcite .",
    "apart from these , there is a body of numerical studies for finite systems , where various authors have shown that finite hubbard models with appropriate band fillings and boundary conditions have fully - polarized ferromagnetic ground states@xcite .    on the other hand , for infinite systems",
    ", the itinerant nature of electrons makes the problem interesting and subtle .",
    "the most important reason is the existence of the spiral - spin(sp ) state , a _",
    "spin - singlet _ state that has the spin - spin correlation length as large as the sample size@xcite , which is known to accompany the fully - polarized ferromagnetic(f ) state in various finite - size itinerant models . by accompanying we",
    "mean sp and f states are close in energy in finite systems , where the ground state changes between them when the boundary condition is twisted .",
    "the sp state does not seem to be an accident of the hubbard model , since sp states are found not only in electron systems with strong charge - charge interactions , but also in those with spin - dependent interactions such as double - exchange@xcite or kondo lattice@xcite models .",
    "so we believe that it is a general feature of strongly correlated systems for the f state to be accompanied by the sp state .",
    "it is rather surprising , since the latter has the total @xmath0 while the former has @xmath1 .",
    "thus it is desirable to resolve this question to understand the ferromagnetism in itinerant systems in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus the problem we have to clarify is the relation between the sp and f states in the thermodynamic limit ( do those states degenerate or coalesce , etc ) , which we address in this paper .",
    "first , we show that the sp state is eligible as the ground state ( i.e. , degenerate with the f state in energy in the thermodynamic limit ) when the f state is the ground state .",
    "we check this for one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model with infinitely large coulomb interaction taken as a typical example and calculate the energies of the sp and f states as a function of the inverse system size with the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method .",
    "next , we discuss whether the symmetry of the sp state is broken in the thermodynamic limit , following the arguments by koma and tasaki@xcite on symmetry breaking and finite - size effects in quantum many - body systems on a lattice .",
    "we show that ( i ) the sp state possesses a kind of order parameter , ( ii ) although the state does not break the global su(2 ) symmetry in the finite system , it does so in the thermodynamic limit by making a linear combination of other states that are degenerate in that limit .",
    "we have studied excitation spectrum of the sp state by calculating one - particle spectral function , dynamical spin and charge susceptibilities for the sp state in various finite - size models , including 1d @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model , tasaki s flat band model , and hubbard ladder .",
    "we have found that the excitation spectrum of these two states in the finite size system are almost identical .",
    "the present results suggest that we should regard the sp state as identical with the f state although they have the total spins in the opposite extremes ( @xmath0 for the sp state , @xmath1 for f ) in the finite size system .",
    "these properties can be exploited to determine the magnetic phase diagram from the calculation of the total spin of the finite - size system in an unambiguous fashion .",
    "otherwise we have to worry about not only the total spin , but the spin - spin correlation to identify sp states in determining the phase diagram .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first confirm that the sp and f states have degenerate energy for @xmath4 : sample size ) in that the energy per site is identical between them .",
    "dmrg is used to calculate the difference in the total energy , @xmath5 , between the sp state and the f state as a function of system size @xmath6 for the @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model with @xmath7 as a typical example .",
    "the extrapolate @xmath8 is always finite ( or zero depending on the boundary condition even in the thermodynamic limit ) , i.e. , @xmath9 per site does indeed vanish .",
    "it implies that when the f state is the ground state , the sp state is also eligible as the ground state if these states are translation invariant .",
    "then we move on to the discussion on symmetry breaking of the sp state along the koma - tasaki s argument . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the single - particle spectral function and dynamical spin and charge susceptibilities for various models .",
    "our results suggest that the sp state and the f state are identical state in the thermodynamic limit .    in sec .",
    "iv , we take an appropriate combination of the boundary condition and the number of electrons to make the sp state higher in energy than the sf state , and the phase diagram for the one - dimensional @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model , tasaki model , and 2-leg hubbard ladder model is obtained with exact diagonalization of small systems . we have found that the phase boundaries rapidly converge to those for larger systems obtained with dmrg .",
    "we may expect that it can be exploited to the determination of the phase diagram of 2d or higher dimensional systems .",
    "a summary of the present study is given in sec .",
    "1d @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model is one of the simplest models that is thought to exhibit ferromagnetism for sufficiently strong electron - electron interaction .",
    "mller - hartmann suggested that in the low - density limit the ground state of @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model is ferromagnetic@xcite .",
    "daul and noack@xcite have carried out highly accurate dmrg calculation to conclude that there is an extensive ferromagnetic phase in the phase diagram .",
    "since the @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model is numerically tractable , we study the energy difference of the sp and f states by taking this model with @xmath7 as an example .    the @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard hamiltonian is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 creates an electron at site @xmath12 with spin @xmath13 , @xmath2 is the nearest - neighbor hopping , and @xmath3 the next nearest - neighbor hopping , @xmath14 the hubbard repulsion , and @xmath15 . in this section",
    "we take @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath7 .",
    "as we can check by a simple exact diagonalization , the ground state of the system has always @xmath18 for any value of @xmath14 at least for system sizes up to 12 sites when a periodic boundary condition(pbc ) is adopted .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the phase diagram obtained by daul and noack with an open boundary condition(obc ) , in which a wide ferromagnetic region is found for @xmath17 and large @xmath14 .",
    "let us first confirm that the sp and f states are degenerate in the sense that their difference in the total energy behaves as @xmath19 i.e. , the energy per site vanishes , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the lowest energy within the @xmath18 sector , namely the energy of the sp state .",
    "we take obc , because the dmrg becomes most accurate for this condition . as daul and noack showed@xcite ,",
    "the ground state of @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model is ferromagnetic for @xmath17 and @xmath22 in obc at least up to 50 sites . to estimate @xmath9",
    ", we must calculate the energy of the ground state of the @xmath18 sector which has higher energy than the ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "therefore , we add the term @xmath23 to the original hamiltonian ( [ eqnttj ] ) to selectively shift the states with higher total spin to higher energies by turning on @xmath24 , while conserving the su(2 ) symmetry . here",
    "we set @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "[ dmrgspin ] , we show the spin correlation function , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) of the spin singlet state for @xmath28 sites , @xmath29 as an example .",
    "we can see that the spin correlation wave length is as large as the system size .",
    "namely , the spin singlet state is the sp state .",
    "since dmrg is a variational procedure , the energy of the sp state is an upper bound , while the energy of the f state is calculated exactly because the f state does not feel the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "hence we overestimate @xmath9 . to minimize this overestimation",
    ", we must calculate the energy of the sp state as accurately as possible .",
    "this is the reason why we have set @xmath7 and @xmath17 .",
    "namely , the exclusion of double occupancies reduces the hilbert space drastically , while a small value of @xmath30 reduces the truncation error .    using the finite - size algorithm in dmrg , we calculated up to @xmath31 for the density of electrons @xmath32 , sweeping the system about 20 times to improve the wave function .",
    "we store the density matrix at each step to construct good initial vector for each super - block diagonalization .",
    "we have kept up to @xmath33 states per block at each step , where the convergence is checked by comparing the results for @xmath34 . the truncation error is smaller than @xmath35 , which is small enough to enable us to extrapolate @xmath8 .    in fig .",
    "[ dmrgene](solid line ) , we show the results for @xmath5 as a function of inverse system size @xmath36 for electron density @xmath32 .",
    "we can see that all the points for @xmath37 fall upon a linear dependence on @xmath36 , from which we can extract @xmath8 .",
    "for all the densities studied , @xmath8 indeed remains finite ( @xmath38 ) . in order to check whether the result is not an accident for @xmath7",
    ", we can introduce the effect of large but finite @xmath14 as an ( antiferromagnetic ) exchange interaction @xmath39 , @xmath40 added to the @xmath7 @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model . here",
    "@xmath41 is the spin operator , where @xmath42 is the pauli matrices and @xmath43 denotes the gutzwiller projection operator . in fig .",
    "[ dmrgene ] the results for @xmath44 are superposed .",
    "we can see that @xmath9 does not change drastically even if we introduce the effect of finite @xmath14 .",
    "this kind of @xmath9 may depend on the boundary condition , which can be indeed the case with finite systems .",
    "for instance , kusakabe and aoki@xcite have shown for a finite two - dimensional hubbard model that nagaoka s ferromagnetic state ( one hole in the half - filled band with @xmath7 ) alternate with an sp state as the boundary condition is changed from periodic to anti - periodic . in other words",
    "a level crossing takes place between the two states as an aharonov - bohm magnetic flux is introduced to twist the boundary condition .",
    "such a boundary effect can affect the ` energy gap ' even in the thermodynamic limit in general .",
    "thus we compare in fig .",
    "[ boundary ] the ordinary obc ( the same as fig .",
    "[ dmrgene ] , solid line ) and the boundary condition in which we further turn off the nearest - neighbor transfers ( @xmath2 ) at either end of the system in the @xmath2-@xmath3 model for @xmath8 at @xmath32 .",
    "we can see that @xmath8 becomes zero ( negligibly small ) in the latter case .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude a possibility for which the sp state has a lower energy than the f state in some appropriate boundary condition .",
    "in other words , the problem which state has a lower energy is a very subtle problem .",
    "as we have seen , it is meaningless in the thermodynamic limit to identify the ground state by studying small ` finite ' differences in the total energy between the candidates , so that a totally different point of view is required .",
    "the mathematical definition of the ground state in the thermodynamic limit is reviewed in koma and tasaki s article@xcite and here we follow them . for simplicity , we focus on the case of pbc .",
    "we first recapitulate the definition .",
    "let @xmath45 be an arbitrary local operator that acts on a finite number of sites .",
    "we define @xmath46 as @xmath47 for each @xmath45 , and we call @xmath46 as ` state ' in the thermodynamic limit . here",

    "we also assume a hamiltonian @xmath55 that is local as defined by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a local component such as @xmath58 for the hubbard model .",
    "we then define the ground - state energy density @xmath59 as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a state in @xmath55 and @xmath62 is the norm of @xmath48 .",
    "a state @xmath63 in the infinite - volume limit is said to be a ground state if it satisfies @xmath64 for arbitrary @xmath65 .    in the present context , we have seen in the previous section that the numerical results for the hubbard model imply that the energy per site of the sp state and the f state is identical in the thermodynamic limit for any boundary condition , especially pbc . in this boundary condition",
    "the system has a translational invariance , so that an sp state in a finite system should have latexmath:[\\[t(x)|{\\rm sp}\\rangle_{\\lambda } = \\exp(i\\gamma )    which translates the state by @xmath65 .",
    "we can expect that the invariance holds in the thermodynamic limit as well , so that @xmath67 and we can conclude that the sp state in pbc is also the ground state in the thermodynamic limit .      one important question is : does the sp state , despite its being spin singlet , accompany a symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit ? for simplicity , we consider the 1d case . from the numerical results for the spin - spin correlation in finite systems ,",
    "a natural quantity that is expected to become nonzero ( in pbc ) is @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "we can then introduce an order parameter , @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "three operators @xmath72 , which obey a lie algebra , satisfy the assumption required for theorem 2.4 in ref . .",
    "the expectation values of the squared @xmath73 is @xmath74 we can always take @xmath75 to be real in pbc since @xmath55 is real .",
    "@xmath76 can also be represented as a real matrix , so that @xmath77 is a real number , and we have @xmath78 so that the last line above vanishes .",
    "from the inequality eq.([cosss ] ) we have @xmath79 on the other hand the order parameters , when not squared , satisfy @xmath80 thus we have @xmath81 as the ` low - lying state ' in the theorem 2.4 in ref . , which asserts that a symmetry breaking can occur when some low - lying excitations whose energies approach that of the state in question like @xmath36 mix with it . here",
    "@xmath82 does have an energy that approaches to @xmath83 as @xmath84 we also have , according to theorem 2.5@xcite , @xmath85 where , @xmath86.\\ ] ] here , let us introduce the translation operator @xmath87 , which satisfies @xmath88 . since @xmath89 @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a constant .",
    "thus , for @xmath92 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) , @xmath93 therefore , we have @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a finite subspace of @xmath48 whose size is @xmath96 .",
    "hence , @xmath97 namely , although the sp state itself does not break the symmetry , it does so in in the thermodynamic limit by letting @xmath98 mix with it in that limit .",
    "in other words , an arbitrarily large but finite region in an sp state has a broken su(2 ) with a finite magnetization .",
    "if we use identities @xmath99 , @xmath100=0 $ ] , @xmath101 , @xmath102 thus both of the sp state and @xmath98 that mixes with it in the thermodynamic limit turn out to be orthogonal to the f state for finite systems .",
    "finally , let us discuss whether @xmath103 is the ground state in the thermodynamic limit by checking whether @xmath104 holds for arbitrary @xmath65 . since @xmath105 @xmath106 does indeed hold for arbitrary @xmath65 in the limit of @xmath107 .",
    "this means @xmath103 is the ground state .",
    "having shed light in the context of koma - tasaki s argument , we may now conjecture that the sp state and the f state are identical in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus let us have a closer look at the sp state as compared with the f state in three one - dimensional models , i.e. , the @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model , tasaki s flat band model , and the two - leg hubbard ladder . to determine whether the sp and f states are identical in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we must show that the relation @xmath108 holds for arbitrary local operator @xmath45 .",
    "although it is impossible to confirm this for all the possible @xmath45 , if the f state and the sp state are identical in that limit , the excitation spectrum of these state in finite size system are expected to be almost identical . to confirm this",
    ", we look specifically at the single - particle spectral function and the dynamical spin and charge correlation functions of the sp state .",
    "indeed we will show that since the nature of the sp state in finite systems is almost identical to that of the f state , we can not distinguish the sp state from the f state by looking at these quantities for sufficiently large system .      in the @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model where the electron transfer extends to next nearest neighbors ( @xmath3 ) , the ground state is @xmath18 for any value of @xmath14 in pbc at least for sizes up to 12 sites as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "let us first look at the spin - spin correlation function , @xmath109 , to confirm that the @xmath18 ground state for large enough @xmath110 is the sp state .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ spinspinco ] the result for 10 electrons in a 12-site ring ( two holes ) with @xmath111 or 40 . for @xmath111 , a short - range antiferromagnetic spin - spin correlation",
    "is observed for @xmath112 . by contrast , for @xmath113 ( or larger , which falls upon the ferromagnetic region in the phase diagram ; see fig .",
    "[ apbcphasett02 ] below ) , the spin - spin correlation has a wave length as large as the system size , which is the same behavior of the lowest @xmath18 state in obc ( fig . [ dmrgspin ] ) .    a more detailed nature the states",
    "is encapsulated in the single - particle spectral function given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 denote the electron addition ( removal ) spectrum with @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 the ground state and its energy , respectively .",
    "we have numerically calculated this quantity . in fig .",
    "[ akw1 ] , we show the result for the parameter values adopted in fig.[spinspinco ] with @xmath113 .",
    "we can see that the luttinger relation , @xmath120 ( with @xmath121 here ) , for the spin unpolarized electrons is violated in favor of @xmath122 , which would be expected for fully spin - polarized fermions .",
    "this behavior in the single particle spectral function is consistent with the nearly ferromagnetic nature of the sp state .",
    "such a behavior was first found for the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath123 model by eder and ohta@xcite , and then given an interpretation subsequently@xcite .",
    "the @xmath124-dependence of the spectral function may be analyzed by evoking the argument by doucot and wen(dw)@xcite , who studied the infinite-@xmath14 hubbard model on a two - dimensional square lattice with two holes to find a trial state that gives an energy lower by @xmath125 than nagaoka s ferromagnetic state .",
    "the key idea of dw is based on the following intuition .",
    "holes behave as free fermions for on - site interactions when the background spin state is ferromagnetic ( or nearly so ) .",
    "assume that fully polarized electrons take an open - shell configuration ( in which there is a degeneracy in the free - electron configurations ) in @xmath124-space in pbc .",
    "if the background spin state is changed from f to the sp spin texture , a fictitious gauge field corresponding to half flux quantum is generated .",
    "this shifts the @xmath124-points by half the @xmath124-point spacing , which lowers the kinetic energy because the polarized electrons now take a closed - shell configuration .",
    "it is a nontrivial question whether the dw s trial state may be applied to reproduce the spinless - fermion - like behavior in @xmath126 found here for the 1d system .",
    "let us assume , for simplicity , that the holes hop in a rigid spin background , although in the original paper dw considered the holes dressed by spin waves .",
    "the energy of the hole in the @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model is then given as @xmath127 where @xmath128 is an integer ) is wave number and @xmath129 corresponds to the sign of the fictitious flux .",
    "we can see that the fitting in fig .",
    "[ akw1 ] is remarkably good . to be precise ,",
    "the transfer integrals in the original dw are taken to be effective ones ( @xmath130 ) to take care of the reduction in the transfer between slightly twisted spins , but the present result is better fitted with these reduction factors omitted ( dashed curves ) .    in the addition spectrum an almost dispersionless band of low intensity peaks",
    "is seen ( at around @xmath131 in fig .",
    "[ akw1 ] ) .",
    "if the ground state were the fully polarized f state , then such a band is expected , since we can add an opposite spin at any @xmath124-point .",
    "a remnant of such a band again suggests the nearly ferromagnetic nature of the sp state .",
    "a next question is whether the sp state persists for more than two holes . in fig .",

    "we can expect that they will become identical in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "tasaki@xcite proposed a hubbard model on a special class of lattice structures for which the lowest energy band is dispersionless ( flat ) .",

    "this is due to the appearance of the sp state , which are encountered if we assume pbc for even number of electrons , or more generally , if we assume a boundary condition for which the fully - polarized electrons take an open - shell configuration in the ground state .",
    "since the sp state may be regarded as ferromagnetic as elaborated in previous sections , we have then to distinguish the sp state from nonmagnetic states by calculating the spin correlation , etc . here",
    "we propose that this difficulty can be readily overcome by taking an appropriate combination of the boundary condition and the electron number for which the sp state is excluded from the ground state  this enables us to obtain a reliable magnetic phase diagram within finite - size studies by simply looking at @xmath174 without worrying about the existence of @xmath18 ferromagnetic - like states .",
    "we stress here that this procedure is allowed because the sp state may be regarded as ferromagnetic : if the sp state were a distinct state , then the exclusion of sp states would lead to a missed phase transition .    here",
    "we illustrate this with an appropriate boundary condition that makes the f state take a closed - shell configuration .",
    "we present the phase diagram thus obtained for the models employed in section iii , i.e. , 1d @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model , tasaki s model , and 2-leg hubbard ladder . in all cases ,",
    "the results accurately coincide with those obtained by dmrg calculation for much larger systems with obc . in other words",
    ", the result converges to the thermodynamic limit rapidly when we concentrate on the f states .",
    "we may expect that this method should be applicable to the determination of the phase diagram of 2d or higher dimensional systems .",
    "we first observe that , in the one - electron energy band of the @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model , @xmath175 the band minimum at @xmath176 splits into double minima for @xmath177 as @xmath3 is increased . hereafter in this section , we set @xmath16 .",
    "we first look at the case of @xmath178 .",
    "the band has a single minimum , so that an even number of fully - polarized electrons take a closed - shell configuration for all densities @xmath179 if we assume apbc to put the @xmath124-points symmetrically about @xmath176 . in fig .",
    "[ apbcphasett02 ] , we show the exact diagonalization results for 4 , 6 , 8 , or 10 electrons in a 12-site system ( @xmath180 ) , and 4 , 6 , or 8 electrons in a 10-site system . we have also plotted the dmrg result for the phase boundary obtained by daul and noack for a 50-site system with obc@xcite .",
    "we can immediately see that the results obtained with apbc for fairly small systems is close to that obtained for larger ones .",
    "if we move on to the case of a larger @xmath181 , an even number of fully - polarized electrons only take a closed - shell configuration for apbc when the fermi energy is higher than @xmath182 .",
    "when the fermi energy is lower , the situation depends on how the @xmath124-points are located around the double - minimum dispersion in the given boundary condition , so we concentrate on the former case . in fig .",
    "[ apbcphasett08 ] , we show the results for 8 or 10 electrons in a 12-site system and 8 electrons in a 10-site system .",
    "we can see that the result for small systems with apbc is very close to the dmrg result for a 50-site system .",
    "the phase diagram against @xmath14 and @xmath183 ( that controls the dispersion of the band ) of the 1d tasaki s model ( a chain of triangles ) was obtained by sakamoto and kubo@xcite for various band fillings ( @xmath184 ) by means of the dmrg method with pbc . as they mention",
    ", the phase boundary between @xmath185 and @xmath18 varies strongly with the system size for small systems , so that a reliable phase diagram can be obtained only by going to sufficiently large ( @xmath28 ) systems .    in fig .",
    "[ phaseflat ] , we show the phase boundary determined by exact diagonalization for @xmath186 and system size as small as 8 or 12 sites with apbc . here",
    "we fix @xmath187 , so that the lower band becomes flat for @xmath188 . again",
    ", the result excellently agrees with that of 32 sites with pbc .      as mentioned in sec .",
    "iiic , kohno@xcite obtained the phase diagram of @xmath7 hubbard ladder by means of the dmrg method . according to his results",
    ", there is a wide region of partially ferromagnetic phase in the neighborhood of paramagnetic phase .",
    "let us consider whether we can reproduce the phase boundary between non - magnetic phase and partially polarized phase by assuming apbc for small systems .",
    "we consider the case of 6 and 8 electrons on a @xmath189 lattice and 4 and 6 electrons on a @xmath190 lattice .",
    "we performed calculation for @xmath191 , and found the ferromagnetic - non - magnetic transition only for the case of 8 electrons on a @xmath189 lattice , around @xmath192 .",
    "this is consistent with kohno s the result@xcite .",
    "all these results indicate that the phase boundary between the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic states is reasonably close to the thermodynamic limit for small systems when a care is taken ( i.e. , letting fully - polarized electrons take closed shell configurations ) .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the relation between the fully - polarized ferromagnetic state and the spiral spins state , a spin - singlet spin state that has a spin correlation length as large as the system size , which accompanies the fully - polarized ferromagnetic state in a number of electron correlation models . as a typical example , we calculate the energy of the sp state and the f state for one - dimensional @xmath7 @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model , it suggests that the sp state is also the ground state in the thermodynamic limit when the f state is the ground state . following the argument by koma and tasaki@xcite ,",
    "we have also indicated how a symmetry becomes broken in the sp state in the thermodynamic limit , where some ` low - lying states ' become hybridized .",
    "we have then characterized the sp state , an itinerant magnetic state , by calculating the one - particle spectral function .",
    "the result is interpreted in a picture in which holes move almost freely in a twisted spin configuration .",
    "we have also calculated the dynamical spin and charge correlation functions to find that their behaviors in the sp state are similar to those of the f state .    from these",
    "we have conjectured that we should regard the sp state and the f state are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit , even though the sp state ( spin - singlet ) and the f state ( fully - polarized ) are opposite extremes in terms of @xmath193 .",
    "we have then shown that the magnetic phase diagram can be determined accurately from finite - size studies by taking appropriate boundary condition ( that depends on the number of electrons which are accommodated in the shells in the non - interacting case ) that pushes up the energy of the sp state .",
    "this enables us to concentrate on the f states , i.e. , to simply look at the change in @xmath174 .",
    "this is permissible since the sp and f states are regarded to be equivalent , so that we can concentrate on either of them .",
    "we have obtained the phase diagram in this way for 1d @xmath2-@xmath3 hubbard model , tasaki s model and 2-leg hubbard ladder .",
    "we have found that the phase boundary between the ferromagnetic state and the non - magnetic state determined in such a way accurately coincides with those obtained by the dmrg calculation for much larger systems . since the method does not depend on the dimensionality",
    ", we may expect that it should be applicable to the determination of the phase diagram in two or higher dimensional systems .",
