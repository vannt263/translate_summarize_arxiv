    "an important feature of these models is that their dynamics becomes spatially correlated  @xcite , i.e. , growing timescales are accompanied by growing dynamical lengthscales , giving rise to dynamic heterogeneity as observed in experiments and simulations  @xcite .    in this paper , we study by means of extensive numerical simulations the three - dimensional generalization of the east model  @xcite , the north - or - east - or - front ( nef ) model @xcite .",
    "this model is a realization of the ` arrow ' model of ref .",

    "the principal aims of this work are the following :    _ ( i ) quantitative characterization of the fragile limit_. we report numerical results for a wide range of dynamic observables in the nef model , describing in detail distributions of the relevant timescales and lengthscales .",

    "the nef model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 are @xmath3 binary variables defined on each site of a cubic lattice of linear size @xmath4 , which has periodic boundary conditions .",
    "physically , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) describes at a coarse - grained level a site which is mobile ( immobile ) .",
    "the dynamics of the model can be written as follows , @xmath7 { } \\\\ \\end{array } n_i=1 , \\label{rates}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the mean concentration of mobile regions and @xmath9 is the kinetic constraint , @xmath10 the prime indicates that the product is restricted to those three sites , @xmath11 , which are north , front , and east nearest neighbours of site @xmath12 .",
    "the kinetic constraint ( [ kc ] ) implies that site @xmath12 can not change state unless at least one of those three neighbours is in the state @xmath13 .",
    "the system is therefore more constrained than the corresponding one - spin facilitated fa model , where any of its six neighbours can facilitate the site @xmath12 . in the arrow model , anisotropy is only local and results physically from the empirical observation that facilitation has locally a preferred direction that may persist over a certain length scale even though the system is on average totally isotropic  @xcite .",
    "the nef model corresponds therefore to having an infinitely large persistence length of dynamic facilitation .",
    "this is physically unrealistic , but constitutes a useful limit effectively describing systems with a large but finite persistence of dynamic facilitation @xcite .",
    "we performed monte - carlo simulations of the nef model for several temperatures in the range @xmath14 $ ] , covering over eleven orders of magnitude in relaxation times .",
    "such large time scales can be simulated using a continuous time algorithm  @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , this dynamical slow - down is accompanied by the growth of dynamic spatial correlations , and one has to pay attention to possible finite size effects  @xcite .",
    "this is however not a serious problem in the present model because even at very large time scales spatial correlations are not very large ( see below ) . at the lowest temperature simulated a system size of @xmath15 proved to be large enough .",
    "compare this to the system size @xmath16 used in the strong limit to simulate similar timescales  @xcite .",
    "equilibrium behaviour is trivial due to the non - interacting hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to produce independent equilibrated initial configurations .",
    "simulations therefore only consist of production runs .",
    "averages are then performed over truly independent initial configurations .",
    "we first consider the spatially averaged dynamics , which may be probed via the mean persistence function , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the single - site persistence function at time @xmath19 , which takes the value @xmath20 if site @xmath12 has not flipped up to time @xmath19 , and the value @xmath21 otherwise . as discussed in ref .",

    "the shape of the mean persistence function will be discussed below in some detail . for the moment",
    ", we simply note that the long - time decay is non - exponential , as is commonly observed in supercooled liquids .",

    "[ pers ] .",
    "the mean relaxation time , @xmath27 , is extracted via the usual relation @xmath28 . in the present context , @xmath29 represents also the @xmath0-relaxation of the model .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath29 is shown in fig .",
    "the main observation from this figure is that the mean - relaxation time grows with decreasing temperature in a super - arrhenius manner , see fig .",
    "the nef model behaves as a fragile supercooled liquid , as expected @xcite .",
    "note however that the ratio @xmath30 that can be extracted from fig .",
    "[ taut ] is about three times smaller in fragile liquids such as orthoterphenyl .",
    "various fits are also included in fig .",
    "the high temperature behaviour is well described by a naive mean - field approximation  @xcite , @xmath31 this behaviour breaks down below @xmath25 , where dynamics is dominated by local fluctuations of the mobility .",
    "generalizing to three dimensions the results for the east model  @xcite , we expect that in the limit of small temperature , the time scale behaves as @xmath32 with @xmath33 at low @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a constant . since @xmath36 , eq .",
    "( [ bassler ] ) implies an exponential inverse temperature squared dependence at low temperatures , @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , an empirical fit using @xmath38 allows one to describe the whole temperature range studied , using @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the supposedly exact low - temperature result , @xmath41 , works well for very large relaxation times .",
    "indeed we find that a plot of @xmath42 vs. @xmath43 nicely converges to the theoretical value @xmath44 ( not shown ) . at low temperatures ,",
    "the @xmath0-relaxation in the nef model therefore follows a bssler law  @xcite .",
    "[ taut ] also shows that the low @xmath34 data can be fit using the vogel - fulcher law , @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the bssler and vogel - fulcher curves are hardly distinguishable for over eight orders of magnitude , as has been observed before when fitting experimental data  @xcite . in our case , it is evident that the finite temperature singularity of the vogel - fulcher law is completely unphysical .    as will be discussed below , the fragile behaviour of the nef model results from the existence of a hierarchy of lengthscales governing the dynamical behaviour .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the relaxation time in this model does not follow the adam - gibbs relation which is argued to link dynamics and thermodynamics of supercooled liquids  @xcite . for the nef model , the entropy has essentially an arrhenius behaviour at low temperatures .",
    "the adam - gibbs relation thus predicts the relaxation time to grow as a double exponential of the inverse temperature .",
    "this vastly overestimates the growth of @xmath29 , which follows the bssler law , eqs .",
    "( [ bassler],[bassler2 ] ) . in the same vein , naively extracting a kauzmann temperature by linearly extrapolating the entropy to zero in the same temperature range where the vogel - fulcher law seems to apply ( see fig .  [ taut ] ) , gives a value @xmath46 , which is very different from the vogel - fulcher temperature @xmath47 found above .",
    "although @xmath48 and @xmath49 are ill - defined temperatures in our case , experimentally they are often found to be close in fragile liquids , a feature which is not quantitatively reproduced by the nef model .",
    "the mean relaxation time @xmath27 captures only in part the relaxation behaviour of the model .",
    "we consider in this subsection the distribution of relaxation times , @xmath50 , related to the mean persistence function via  @xcite @xmath51 these distributions are shown in fig .",

    ", we find that the stretching exponent @xmath54 decreases with @xmath34 in the regime @xmath55 , from its high temperature value @xmath56 .    as can be guessed from figs .",
    "[ pers ] and [ dis ] , using @xmath27 and @xmath57 as unique fitting parameters does not allow for a satisfactory description of the whole decay of the persistence function and distribution of relaxation times .",
    "this becomes evident when data are presented in an alternative way .",
    "following the experimental literature , we show the data obtained from the distribution of time scales in a frequency representation via  @xcite @xmath58 as is often done with dielectric susceptibility measurements .",
    "this will also allow us to make quantitative comparisons to experiments below .",
    "the results for @xmath59 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ wing ] . at temperature @xmath60",
    "we show on top of the data the fourier transform of the stretched exponential fit to the long time tail of @xmath22 .",
    "the fit is clearly incorrect in this representation , although it would look acceptable in most of a plot such as in fig .",
    "in fact , deviations appear when @xmath61 , corresponding to @xmath62 in the time domain .",
    "this reveals the presence of ` additional processes ' on the ` high - frequency flank ' of the @xmath0-relaxation .",
    "this feature is obviously reminiscent of the ` high - frequency ' , or ` nagel ' wing extensively studied by dielectric spectroscopy in several materials  @xcite .",
    "the wing is usually observed in fragile glass - formers , but its precise nature has not been fully elucidated . despite initial claims of certain universal behaviour of the high - frequency wing , more recent investigations seem to favour the interpretation that the phenomenon does not obey universal scaling  @xcite .",
    "this is compounded by the observation that the amplitude of the phenomenon also seems to depend on the technique used to study it  @xcite .    in our case ,",
    "the physical interpretation of the wing is very clear . the relaxation of the nef model proceeds in a hierarchical manner , just as in the one - dimensional case  @xcite . in order to relax a domain of immobile regions of size @xmath63 , a region of size @xmath64",
    "must first be relaxed , which itself necessitates the relaxation of a domain of size @xmath65 , etc .",
    ", down to the smallest size @xmath66 .",
    "this implies an energy cost @xmath67 , from which the bssler form , eq.([bassler2 ] ) , and stretched exponential decay , eq .",

    "interestingly , the hierarchy also shows up in the distributions of figs .",
    "[ dis ] and [ wing ] at time scales shorter than the @xmath0-relaxation in a manner reminiscent of the experimental finding of additional short - time processes . due to the underlying lattice structure of the model ,",
    "the hierarchy is discrete rather than continuous , as can be indeed observed in fig .",
    "notice also that there is no ` fast ' process at the microscopic time scale , @xmath68 , in our system .",
    "this is a consequence of coarse - graining by which molecular vibrations are removed .",
    "these results show that the pattern of dynamical relaxation of the nef model is quantitatively accurate on a wide frequency range .",
    "this will be shown explicitly in sec .",
    "[ data ] where dielectric susceptibility data taken close to the experimental glass transition are compared to the nef model results .",
    "we recall that in the strong case the large - time decay was found to be purely exponential , while short - time processes had a much smaller magnitude  @xcite .",
    "this prediction is however hard to confirm experimentally since strong liquids are not easy to study by dielectric spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "physically , our results also suggest that the high - frequency wing observed in fragile glass - formers is an intrinsic feature of the @xmath0-relaxation linked in a direct way to their dynamical hierarchical structure which is also at the origin of stretched relaxation and fragile behaviour .",
    "when the relaxation time is moderate , an even more complex behaviour is observed due to the influence of clusters of defects .",
    "such dynamic objects are irrelevant at low temperatures , but can influence the short - time dynamics just below @xmath25 , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "these clusters were in particular shown to be responsible for the temperature behaviour of a number of quantities discussed in some numerical works .",
    "clusters also produce additional short - time processes visible in the distributions @xmath50 when temperature is not too low  @xcite . interestingly in the present context",
    ", these patterns closely resemble the ones observed experimentally in mildly supercooled liquids and usually explained in terms of mode - coupling theory  @xcite .",
    "this will be demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ data ] , where data recently fitted via mode - coupling theory  @xcite are also fitted using the nef model .",
    "the growth of timescales in the nef model is accompanied by growing spatial correlations as the system approaches its critical point at @xmath69 .",
    "these correlations are purely dynamical in origin , and give rise to dynamic heterogeneity  @xcite .",
    "figures  [ critical ] and [ bubble ] serve to illustrate this phenomenon , as we now explain .",
    "we quantify the local dynamics via the local persistence function @xmath18 .",
    "for a given temperature we run the dynamics for a time @xmath70 , such that @xmath71 , meaning that half of the sites have flipped at least once .",
    "we colour white persistent ( immobile ) spins , for which @xmath72 , and black transient ( currently or previously mobile ) spins , for which @xmath73 .",
    "figure  [ critical ] shows the local persistence function for the nef model at two different temperatures , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . clearly , the low - temperature dynamics is spatially heterogeneous , and the spatial correlations of the local dynamics grow as @xmath34 is decreased .",
    "the ` critical ' nature of dynamic clusters is apparent : the pictures are reminiscent of the spatial fluctuations of an order parameter close to a continuous phase transition , such as the magnetization of an ising model near criticality . in our case",
    ", the order parameter is a dynamic object , the persistence function , and the critical fluctuations are purely dynamical in origin  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that these figures are qualitatively different from the ones obtained in the strong case where dynamic facilitation is isotropic .",

    "[ critical ] the north , east and front directions of facilitation , implying that wandering of excitations in the other three directions is forbidden .",
    "domains of fig .",
    "[ critical ] appear much less rough than the ones obtained in the isotropic case @xcite . in that sense , increasing the fragility is similar to increasing the ` surface tension ' of the dynamic domains observed in fig .",
    "[ critical ] .",
    "the same observation applies to an even more fragile system , the two - spin facilitated fa model in two dimensions , where the corresponding domains resemble a polydisperse assembly of squares  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative observations of dynamic heterogeneity performed in numerical or experimental works can also be made in the present coarse - grained model .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ bubble ] the analog of spatial clustering of subsets of fast and slow sites . to build these snapshots ,",
    "we represent a given percentage , 5% , of the sites that relax faster or slower , i.e. we show those sites for which the persistence time is among the 5% smaller or larger in a randomly chosen run at temperature @xmath60 .",
    "one observes that the fastest sites are not randomly located in space , but clustered in ` non - compact ' or ` stringy ' objects , similar to those observed in simulations and experiments  @xcite .",
    "the shape of these objects is a consequence of the existence of point defects of mobility .",
    "when a defect moves , it induces those sites along its trajectory to relax , so leaving in its wake a string of fast sites .    in fig .  [ bubble ]",
    "we also show 5% of the sites which are slowest , using the same simulation temperature as before . a more compact structure is seen .",
    "this is again the consequence of the relaxation via point defects of mobility .",
    "the slowest sites belong to regions of space devoid of defects which take then a very long time to be visited by defects .",
    "these large domains are thus slowly relaxed .",
    "it is the bulk of these slow domains that is observed in fig .",

    "the susceptibility develops at low temperature a peak whose amplitude increases , and whose position shifts to larger times as @xmath34 decreases .",
    "as expected , the location of the peak scales with the relaxation time @xmath27 , indicating that dynamical trajectories are maximally heterogeneous when @xmath87 .    in figure  [ cr ]",
    "we show the correlator @xmath88 and the structure factor @xmath81 for different temperatures and fixed times @xmath89 where dynamic heterogeneity is maximal .",
    "these correlation functions confirm , as suggested by fig .",
    "[ critical ] , that a dynamic length scale associated with spatial correlations of mobility develops and grows as @xmath34 decreases : spatial correlations decay more slowly with distance as @xmath34 decreases , while a peak in the structure develops and grows at @xmath90 .",

    "it is interesting to note that the relation between susceptibility and length is very different in the strong and fragile cases , since we find that @xmath115 in the nef model , while the scaling is closer to @xmath116 in the fa case  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we use the numerical results obtained in previous sections to fit experimental data with the nef model . in doing so there are several points that need to be considered .    first , the model we use is meant to be a description of supercooled liquids which is coarse - grained both in time and space , and lives on a lattice .",
    "we are thus dealing with discrete , rather than continuous , spatial degrees of freedom , and the very short - time dynamics of the liquid is removed . by construction , this produces discrepancies between real data on liquids and numerical nef model data , especially for short times and small lengths .",
    "this is a small price to pay in such an approach given the large number of features that can still be satisfactorily accounted for with the nef model .",
    "second , we have some freedom on how to relate real experimental timescales and monte carlo steps in the simulation .",

    "third , one must adjust the temperature given in kelvin in experiments to the adimensional @xmath34 of the simulations .",
    "this amounts to fitting the value of an energy scale , @xmath119 , which should appear on dimensional grounds in front of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . in principle , @xmath119 could be fixed independently by fitting , say , viscosity data of a given liquid before using the corresponding temperatures to fit more detailed dynamic data in what would be a zero - parameter fitting procedure .",
    "we have done the correspondence in a less constrained manner , adjusting @xmath34 in the simulation to give a good fit to the data . very satisfactorily , though , we end up with a correspondence between numerical and experimental temperatures which is well described by linear relations , as it should be at low temperatures @xcite .    in fig .",

    "mode - coupling theory is thought to be applicable in this regime , under the assumption that the dynamics at modest supercooling is different from that near @xmath131 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , our results here suggest that this may not be the case .",
    "one of the advantages of the present approach on mode - coupling theory is that it does not produce an unphysical singularity at a temperature above @xmath131 , and it can therefore be used down to very low temperatures and large relaxation times . in fig .",

    "this is one of the central predictions of the dynamic facilitation approach @xcite .",
    "it is a consequence of the temperature dependent dynamic exponent of east - like models such as the nef model , in contrast to strong systems where dynamic lengths go as a fixed power of the relaxation time .",
    "note that a figure qualitatively similar to fig .",
    "[ dyn ] would be obtained for the four - point susceptibility as a function of relaxation time .",
    "this slow growth of lengthscales in the nef model is also compatible with the modest size of heterogeneities as suggested by experiments near @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the lj mixture appears in this representation as a fairly strong system , despite the common assumption that it is a good model for fragile liquids .",
    "the theoretical and numerical findings reported in fig",
    ".  [ dyn ] offer a solution to the paradox that experimentally measured length scales are very small when compared to extrapolations performed from numerical works  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have presented an extensive numerical study of the north - or - east - or - front model , the three - dimensional generalization of the east facilitated spin model .",
    "the nef model , whose dynamical rules have an externally imposed asymmetry , is in the same universality class of the more physical arrow model of ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit of maximal directional persistence , and therefore models the behaviour of fragile , super - arrhenius , glass formers .",
    "we have characterized the equilibrium dynamics of the nef model through measurements of the @xmath0-relaxation timescales , distributions of relaxation times , and the growth of dynamic correlation lengths and four - point susceptibilities .",
    "we find that @xmath132 follows a bssler law of exponential - inverse - squared temperature dependence , and that the dynamic correlation length grows as @xmath133 with @xmath104 , where @xmath134 is the equilibrium concentration of excitations , while the dynamic susceptibility grows as @xmath135 with @xmath106 .",
    "these results confirm some of the expectations of ref.@xcite for the arrow model , in particular the quasi one - dimensional nature of the dynamics in all dimensions .",
    "the decay of the four - point structure factor , @xmath136 , is a direct generalization of the result for the 1d east model @xcite , and an indication of hierarchical dynamics in the nef model .",
    "these two features , persistence of directionality and hierarchical dynamics , give rise to fragile behaviour @xcite .",
    "we have shown how the nef model can be used to rationalize experimental observations over a wide range of temperatures and timescales .",
    "we have fitted correlation data in the time domain , obtained in the mildly supercooled regime by optical kerr effect @xcite , with the nef model predictions .",
    "this provides an interpretation of the quasi logarithmic time dependence of correlations based on the coexistence of isolated excitations and clusters of excitations , which occurs when the system is crossing over from a regime of homogeneous dynamics at high @xmath34 to one of heterogeneous dynamics at low @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we have shown how the nef model can also be used to describe dielectric susceptibility data , in the frequency representation , measured close to the glass transition by dielectric spectroscopy .",
    "interestingly , the nef model successfully accounts for the excess high - frequency or nagel wing @xcite .",
