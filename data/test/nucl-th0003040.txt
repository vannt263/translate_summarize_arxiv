    "it has now been well established that close to the neutron drip line , there exist nuclei having one , or some times two , very loosely bound valence neutrons extending too far out in space with respect to a dense charged core  @xcite .",
    "the properties of these neutron halo nuclei @xcite have been reviewed by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the halo systems , which involve a new form of nuclear matter , are characterized by large reaction and coulomb dissociation cross sections @xcite . moreover , in the breakup reactions induced by these nuclei , the angular distributions of neutrons measured in coincidence with the core nuclei  @xcite are strongly forward peaked and the parallel momentum distributions of the core fragment have very narrow widths @xcite . due to their strikingly different properties",
    "as compared to those of the stable nuclei , such systems provide a stringent test of the nuclear structure models developed for the latter .",
    "the coulomb dissociation is a significant reaction channel in the scattering of halo nuclei from a stable heavy target nucleus .",
    "it provides a convenient tool to investigate their structure .",
    "for instance , it would place constraints on their electric dipole response @xcite . of course , in the serber @xcite type of models @xcite",
    ", the breakup cross sections are directly related to the momentum space wave function of the projectile ground state .",
    "the studies of the coulomb dissociation of weakly bound nuclei are also of interest due to their application in determining the cross sections of the astrophysically interesting radiative capture reactions at solar temperatures @xcite .",
    "the coulomb dissociation of halo nuclei has been investigated by several authors recently , using a number of different theoretical approaches .",
    "a semiclassical coupled channel formalism has been used by authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , while in refs .",
    "@xcite the relative motion of the core and the valence particle is described by a time dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "the results within these approaches depend on the range of the impact parameter associated with the straight line trajectories used to describe the motion of the projectile in the field of target nuclei .",
    "however , in these studies the emphasis was on investigating the dynamics of the coulomb dissociation , and not the structure of the projectile ground state which was assumed to have some very simple zero range ( zr ) form .",
    "similar assumption for the projectile structure was also made in other semiclassical  @xcite and prior form distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) calculations  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the post form dwba theory of the breakup reactions incorporates the details of the ground state structure of the projectile in the breakup amplitude  @xcite .",
    "however , in an earlier application @xcite of this theory to calculate the breakup of the halo nuclei , the simplifying approximation of the zero range interaction was used .",
    "this approximation necessarily excludes the use of this theory to describe the breakup of non-@xmath5  wave projectiles .",
    "moreover its applicability is questionable even for @xmath5  wave projectiles at higher beam energies @xcite .",
    "therefore , to investigate the details of the projectile structure through breakup reactions within this theory , the inclusion of the finite range effects is necessary .",
    "it may be noted that in a recently formulated adiabatic model  @xcite of the coulomb breakup reactions , where it is assumed that the projectile excitation is predominantly to the states of the low internal energy , the details of the ground state wave function also enters in the transition amplitude .    in this paper , we present a theoretical model to describe the coulomb breakup of a projectile within the framework of the post form dwba where finite range effects are included , approximately , via a local momentum approximation ( lma )  @xcite . the exact treatment of the finite range effects within this theory , although desirable , is much too complicated as it would lead to six dimensional integrals involving functions which are oscillatory asymptotically .",
    "the lma leads to two simplifying features .",
    "first , it factorises the dynamics of the reaction from the structure effects of the projectile and second , it results in an amplitude where the term describing the dynamics of the process is the same as that evaluated in the zr approximation .",
    "we present the application of this theory to the coulomb breakup of neutron rich nuclei @xmath0be and @xmath6c on a number of heavy targets .",
    "we attempt to put constraints on the ground state structure of these nuclei by analyzing almost all the available data on the energy , angular and longitudinal momentum distributions of fragments using various configurations of the projectile ground state .",

    ", we write @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the bound state wave function of the projectile having its radial and angular parts as @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , which are associated with the relative motion of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath29 is the coulomb distorted scattering wave describing the relative motion of the c.m . of the projectile with respect to the target with outgoing wave boundary condition .",
    "the assumption inherent in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is that the breakup channels are very weakly coupled and hence this coupling needs to be treated only in the first order .",

    "( 6 ) @xmath32 is the relative motion angular momentum between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    "we have written @xmath39 .    it may be noted that the reduced amplitude @xmath37 involves a six dimensional integral which makes its evaluation quite complicated .",
    "the problem gets further acute due to the fact that the integrand involves three scattering waves which have oscillatory behavior asymptotically .",
    "therefore , several approximate methods have been used in the literature to avoid the evaluation of six dimensional integrals . in the zero range approximation ( zra )",
    "@xcite one assumes @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the usual zero range constant .",
    "this approximation reduces the six dimensional integral in eq.(8 ) to a three - dimensional one .",
    "the corresponding amplitude is written as @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , the details of the projectile structure enter in the reaction amplitude only as a multiplicative constant @xmath41 .",

    ", this approximation may not be satisfied for heavier projectiles and at higher beam energies @xcite .",
    "baur and trautmann ( bt ) @xcite have proposed an alternative approximate scheme in which the projectile c.m .",
    "coordinate in the corresponding distorted wave in eq .",
    "( 8) is replaced by that of the core - target system , i.e. @xmath43 . with this approximation",
    "the amplitude @xmath37 splits into two factors each involving a three dimensional integral @xmath44 the first term , known as the form factor , depends on the structure of the projectile through its ground state wave function @xmath45 .",
    "the second term involves the dynamics of the reaction .",
    "this amplitude ( which will be referred to as the bt amplitude ) , used originally to study the deuteron breakup at sub - coulomb energies @xcite , was applied to the calculations of the coulomb breakup of halo nuclei in @xcite .",
    "this approximation , which allows the application of the theory to non-@xmath5  wave projectiles , may seem to be justified if the c.m of the @xmath46 system is shifted towards @xmath9 ( which is indeed the case if @xmath47 ) .",
    "however , the neglected piece of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) occurs in association with the wave vector @xmath19 , whose magnitude may not be negligible for the reactions at the higher beam energies .",
    "therefore , contribution coming to the amplitude from the neglected part of @xmath48 may still be substantial .",
    "an approximate way of taking into account the finite range effects in the post form dwba theory is provided by the local momentum approximation @xcite .",
    "the attractive feature of this approximation is that it leads to the factorization of the amplitude @xmath37 similar to that obtained in the bt case .",
    "we use this approximation to write the coulomb distorted wave of particle @xmath9 in the final channel as @xmath50 eq .",

    "system and @xmath56 is the coulomb potential between @xmath9 and the target at a distance @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the local momentum @xmath58 is evaluated at some distance @xmath57 , and its magnitude is held fixed for all the values of @xmath59 . as is discussed in appendix a ,",
    "the results of our calculations are almost independent of the choice of the direction the local momentum .",
    "therefore , we have taken the directions of @xmath58 and @xmath60 to be the same in all the calculations presented in this paper .",
    "it may be noted that in the calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lma was applied to the coulomb distorted wave of the projectile channel , where making a choice of the direction of the local momentum is some what complicated due to the fact that the directions of both the fragments in the final channel has to be brought into the consideration .",
    "detailed discussion on the validity of the local momentum approximation is presented in appendix a.    substituting eq .",
    "( 12 ) into eq .",
    "( 8) we get the following factorized form of the amplitude @xmath61 eq . ( 14 ) ( which will be referred to as the frdwba amplitude in the following ) looks like eq ( 11 ) of the bt theory but with the very important difference that the form factor is now evaluated at the momentum transfer ( @xmath62 ) , and not at the valence particle momentum @xmath63",
    ". the two momenta could be quite different for cases of interest in this paper .",
    "the second term , involving the dynamics part of the reaction , is the same in both the cases .",
    "therefore , the breakup amplitude obtained in bt approximation differs from that of frdwba by a factor @xmath64    recently , a theory of the coulomb breakup has been developed within an adiabatic ( ad ) model @xcite , where one assumes that the excitation of the projectile is such that the relative energy ( @xmath65 ) of the @xmath66 system is much smaller than the total incident energy , which allows @xmath65 to be replaced by the constant separation energy of the fragments in the projectile ground state .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that under these conditions the wave function @xmath18 has an exact solution as given below @xmath67    substituting @xmath68 for @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) leads to the reduced amplitude : @xmath70 this amplitude differs from those of bt as well as frdwba only in the form factor part ( first term ) , which is evaluated here at the momentum transfer @xmath71 .",
    "( 17 ) can also be obtained in the dwba model by making a local momentum approximation to the coulomb distorted wave in the initial channel of the reaction , and by evaluating the local momentum at @xmath72 with its direction being the same as that of the projectile @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic model does not make the weak coupling approximation of the dwba .",
    "however , it necessarily requires one of the fragments ( in this case @xmath10 ) to be chargeless .",
    "in contrast , the dwba with the lma could , in principle , be applied to cases where both the fragments @xmath9 and @xmath10 are charged @xcite ( of course the dynamical part of the amplitude can not be expressed in terms of the simple bremsstrahlung integral in this case as discussed below ) . while the effect of nuclear breakup in the adiabatic model description of elastic scattering of the loosely bound projectile has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nuclear part of the amplitude for breakup reactions is yet to be calculated within this model . at the same time",
    ", the nuclear breakup cross section has not been calculated within the frdwba theory also ( although it is straightforward to do so ) .",
    "these calculations will be presented in a future publication .",
    "the triple differential cross section of the reaction is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the appropriate @xcite three - body phase space factor , given by @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 being evaluated in the appropriate frame of reference .",

    "apart from the distance at which local momentum is calculated ( which is taken to be 10 @xmath93 as discussed in appendix a ) and its direction ( described already in the previous section ) , the only other input to our calculations is the radial part of the projectile ground state wave function .",
    "the forms for this as chosen by us for the projectiles considered in this paper are discussed in the following .      for the ground state of @xmath0be , we have considered the following configurations : ( a ) a @xmath5  wave valence neutron coupled to @xmath94 @xmath95be core ( @xmath95be@xmath96 ) with a one - neutron separation energy ( @xmath97 ) of 504 kev and a spectroscopic factor ( sf ) of 0.74 @xcite , ( b ) a @xmath98  wave valence neutron coupled to @xmath99 @xmath95be core ( @xmath95be@xmath100 ) with a binding energy of 3.872 mev ( which is the sum of energy of the excited 2@xmath101 core ( 3.368 mev ) and @xmath97 ) and ( c ) an admixture of these two configurations with spectroscopic factors of 0.74 and 0.17 respectively @xcite . in each case , the single particle wave function , is constructed by assuming the valence neutron-@xmath95be interaction to be of woods - saxon type whose depth is adjusted to reproduce the corresponding value of the binding energy with fixed values of the radius and diffuseness parameters ( taken to be 1.15 @xmath93 and 0.5 @xmath93 respectively ) . for configuration ( a ) , this gives a potential depth of 71.03 mev , a root mean square ( rms ) radius for the valence neutron of 6.7 @xmath93 and a rms radius for @xmath0be of 2.91 @xmath93 when the size of the @xmath95be core is taken to be 2.28 @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "in some cases we have also used a wave function for the @xmath5  state of @xmath0be calculated within a dynamical core polarization ( dcp ) model @xcite .      in fig .",
    "2 , we present the results of our frdwba calculations for the double differential cross section ( @xmath102 ) as a function of the neutron energy at the neutron angle of @xmath103 , in the breakup of @xmath0be on a gold target at the beam energy of 44 mev / nucleon .",
    "the experimental data are taken from @xcite .",
    "the results obtained with configurations ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) for the ground state of @xmath0be are shown by dotted , dashed and full lines respectively .",
    "the results of configuration ( b ) are plotted after multiplying the actual numbers by a factor of 1000 .",
    "the cross sections obtained with configurations ( a ) and ( c ) are indistinguishable from each other . thus these two configurations produce almost identical results for the coulomb dissociation of @xmath0be . in the following ,",
    "we have used configuration ( a ) for the ground state state of @xmath0be in all the calculations .    in fig .",
    "3 , we present a comparison of our calculation with the data ( taken from @xcite ) for the energy distribution of the neutron emitted in the same reaction as in fig . 2 at two forward angles .",
    "calculations performed within both frdwba and ad model are shown in this figure . the same configuration for",
    "the @xmath0be ground state has been used in both the cases .",
    "the beam energy in this experiment @xcite varies between 36.9  44.1 mev / nucleon . to take into account this spread",
    ", we have performed calculations at both its upper ( 44 mev / nucleon ) ( solid line ) and lower ends ( 37 mev / nucleon ) ( dotted line ) . although these data have large statistical errors , the calculations performed at 44 mev / nucleon are in better agreement with the experimental values . thus our calculations may serve to remove the uncertainty in the data in this regard .",
    "it should also be noted that the ad model calculations over - predict the experimental cross sections in the peak region .    as discussed earlier , the cross sections obtained in the bt theory differs from that of the frdwba by the modulus square of the factor @xmath104 as defined by eq .",
    "( 15 ) . in fig .",
    "4 , we have shown the beam energy dependence of @xmath105 for the same reaction as in fig .",
    "2 , for a set of forward angles of the outgoing fragments ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) .",
    "we can see that this quantity is close to unity only at the sub - coulomb beam energies ( of course at higher beam energies it crosses twice the line representing the value 1 ) .",
    "therefore , the bt and frdwba calculations are expected to produce similar results at very low incident energies . depending upon the beam energy ,",
    "the bt results can be larger or smaller than those of the frdwba .    a comparison of the results of the frdwba ( solid line ) and the bt ( dotted line ) calculations for the same reaction as in fig . 2",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "5 . the bombarding energy in this case is 44 mev / nucleon .",
    "we can see that the bt results are larger than those of the frdwba in almost entire region of neutron energies .",
    "this is to be expected from the results shown in fig .",
    "4 , where the quantity @xmath105 is larger than unity at this beam energy .",
    "it may be noted that the frdwba results provide a reasonable good description of the data , particularly in the peak region while bt calculations overestimate them .    in fig .",
    "6 , we show the energy distributions of the charged fragment @xmath95be , calculated within the frdwba ( upper part ) and the ad model ( lower part ) for the breakup of @xmath0be on the au target at the beam energy of 42 mev / nucleon at three angles of 1@xmath109 , 2@xmath109 and 3@xmath109 .",
    "a noteworthy feature of these results is that the peak position in both the calculations is very close to the energy corresponding to the beam velocity .",
    "this suggests that the charged fragment gets almost no post acceleration in the final channel .",
    "this feature of the breakup of halo nuclei ( which is in contrast to the case of the breakup of stable isotopes @xcite ) , was first noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and was corroborated later on by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite . the reason for not observing the post acceleration effects , as put forward by authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , is that due to their very small binding energies the halo nuclei break up far away from the distance of closest approach , which reduces greatly the effect of coulomb repulsion on the charged outgoing fragment .",
    "this argument has received support from a recent calculation of the coulomb dissociation potential of the deuteron which is shown @xcite to have a considerably large value even outside the charge density of the target nucleus .",
    "a separate reason for not observing this effect has been put forward by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , according to which these effects are small as the collision time is much less than the characteristic time for the disintegration of the halo .",
    "however , these quasiclassical arguments have been questioned by the authors of ref .",
    "esbensen , bertsch and bertulani @xcite , who include the higher order processes in the coulomb dissociation of halo nuclei @xmath0li and @xmath0be by solving the three - dimensional time - dependent schrdinger equation , and find a magnitude for the post acceleration effect which is quite appreciable for the @xmath110li fragment in the breakup of @xmath0li and relatively somewhat smaller for the @xmath95be fragment in the breakup of @xmath0be . in the semiclassical calculations of baur , bertulani and kalassa @xcite , where breakup is assumed to take place at some classical distance , it is predicted that post acceleration effects should manifest itself in the increase of the average momentum of the charged fragment with the scattering angle .",
    "indeed , the earlier measurements of nakamura _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is consistent with this observation .    in a recent experiment @xcite ,",
    "the momentum of the @xmath95be core from the breakup of @xmath0be has been measured with sufficient precision to verify the previously reported post acceleration effect .",
    "we have made a comparison of our frdwba calculations with this data in fig .",
    "7 , where we show the calculated and experimental @xmath95be average momenta ( defined as @xmath111 ) as a function of laboratory angle . in the semiclassical picture of ref .",
    "@xcite , the impact parameter decreases with the increase of the scattering angle , thereby making the coulomb repulsion effects on the charged fragment stronger .",
    "therefore , the post acceleration should show up in the increase of this average momentum with the increase of the scattering angle .",
    "however , in both the experimental data of @xcite as well as our calculations no such increase is observed .",
    "thus , neither the data of ref .",
    "@xcite nor our calculations support the results found in ref .",
    "therefore , the semiclassical picture presented in @xcite should be viewed with caution .",
    "the measured neutron angular distribution in the exclusive @xmath0be + @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath95be + n + @xmath112 reaction below the grazing angle is very narrow and is shown to be @xcite dominated by the coulomb breakup process .",
    "this reflects the narrow width of the transverse momentum distribution of the valence neutron in the ground state of @xmath0be , which is consistent with the presence of a neutron halo structure in @xmath0be . in the top half of fig .",
    "8 , we compare the calculated and measured exclusive neutron angular distribution @xmath114 as a function of the neutron angle @xmath115 for the above reaction on a au target at the beam energy of 41 mev / nucleon .",
    "calculations ( where integrations over the core fragment energy is done in the range of 390 to 430 mev , which contributes most to the cross section ) performed within the frdwba ( solid line ) and the ad model ( dotted line ) using the same configuration for the @xmath0be ground state are shown in this figure .",
    "also shown ( dashed line ) here is the frdwba calculation performed with the @xmath0be ground state wave function obtained in the dcp model .",
    "we note that while the frdwba and the ad model results agree with each other well below 12@xmath116 , the difference between the two models starts becoming prominent as the angle increases beyond this value , with the latter developing a dip around 25@xmath116 . at small neutron angles ,",
    "the frdwba calculation done with the dcp wave function overestimates somewhat the measured neutron angular distribution .    to understand the origin of the dip in the ad model calculations of the neutron angular distribution , we have plotted the quantity @xmath117 ) as a function of @xmath118 in the lower half of fig .",
    "8 for both the frdwba ( solid line ) and the ad ( dashed line ) cases .",
    "the energy of fragment @xmath9 corresponds to the beam velocity .",
    "we can see that in the ad case @xmath119 becomes very small around 25@xmath109 , which corresponds to a node in its form factor at the momentum transfer related to this angle .      the relative energy spectrum for the breakup of @xmath0be on a pb target at 72 mev / nucleon is shown in fig .",
    "the top half shows the results obtained with the frdwba ( solid line ) and the ad model ( dotted line ) using configuration ( a ) with the single particle wave function for the @xmath0be ground state , while the bottom half depicts the frdwba results obtained with the single particle and dcp wave functions .",
    "we see that , while both the frdwba and the ad model calculations reproduce the peak value of the data @xcite well , the frdwba calculations done with the dcp wave function overestimate it . on the other hand ,",
    "none of the calculations is able to explain the data at higher relative energies .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that nuclear breakup effects , which can contribute substantially @xcite at higher relative energies ( for @xmath120 @xmath121 0.6 mev ) , are not included in these calculations . of course ,",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claim that their data have been corrected for these contributions .",
    "however , the procedure adopted by them for this purpose is inadequate .",
    "they obtained the nuclear breakup contribution on the pb target , by scaling the cross sections measured on a carbon target .",
    "this scaling procedure is unlikely to be accurate for reactions induced by halo nuclei due to the presence of a long tail in their ground state . in a full quantum mechanical theory ,",
    "both coulomb and nuclear breakup contributions should be calculated on the same footing and corresponding amplitudes should be added coherently to get the cross sections .",
    "calculations done using the bt theory ( dashed line in the upper part of fig .",
    "9 ) underestimates the data considerably .",
    "this difference between the frdwba and the bt results can again be traced to the behavior of @xmath105 in fig .",
    "4 , which is smaller than unity at the beam energy of 72 mev / nucleon of this reaction .    we would like to remark that our post form frdwba results for the pure coulomb breakup contribution to the relative energy spectra for the @xmath0be agrees quite well with a recent calculation of the breakup reaction in a non - perturbative approach where the time evolution of the projectile is calculated by solving a time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite . on the other hand , similar perturbative calculations performed previously @xcite overestimate the data in the peak region .",
    "the neutron halo structure is reflected in the narrow width of the parallel momentum distribution ( pmd ) of the charged breakup fragments emitted in breakup reactions induced by the halo nuclei .",
    "this is because the pmd has been found to be least affected by the reaction mechanism @xcite and therefore , a narrow pmd can be related to a long tail in the matter distribution in the coordinate space via heisenberg s uncertainty principle .    in fig .",
    "10 we present the pmd of the @xmath95be fragment emitted in the breakup of @xmath0be on u and ta targets at 63 mev / nucleon beam energy .",
    "calculations performed within both the frdwba and ad model formalisms using the configuration ( a ) are presented in this figure .",
    "the calculated cross sections are normalized to match the peak of the data points ( which are given in arbitrary units ) @xcite , the normalization constant being the same for both cases .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) for the u and ta targets are 44 mev / c and 43 mev / c respectively in both the frdwba and the ad cases .",
    "these agree well with the averaged experimental value of 43.6@xmath1221.1 mev / c @xcite and also with those calculated in @xcite .",
    "the very narrow widths of the parallel momentum distributions signal the presence of a neutron halo structure in @xmath0be .",
    "it may be noted that the calculations performed with configuration ( c ) gives results identical to that obtained with configuration ( a ) .",
