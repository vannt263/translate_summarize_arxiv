    "the accuracy and the stability of the geometric distortion ( gd ) correction of an instrument is at the basis of its use for high precision astrometry .",
    "the particularly advantageous conditions of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observatory make it ideal for imaging - astrometry of ( faint ) point sources .",
    "the point - spread functions ( psfs ) are not only sharp and ( essentially ) close to the diffraction limit which directly results in high precision positioning but also the observations are not plagued by atmospheric effects ( such as differential refraction , image motion , differential chromatic refraction , etc ) , which severely limit ground - based astrometry .",
    "in addition to this , _ hst _ observations do not suffer from gravity - induced flexures on the structures of the telescope ( and camera ) , which add ( relatively ) large instabilities in the gd of ground - based images , and make its corrections more uncertain .",
    "last may 14 , the brand - new _ wide field camera 3 _ ( wfc3 ) was successfully installed during the _ hubble servicing mission 4 _ ( sm4 , may 12 - 24 2009 ) . after a period of intense testing , fine - tuning , and basic calibration , last september 9th , 2009 , the first calibration- and science - demonstration images were finally made public .",
    "our group is active in bringing _",
    "hst _ to the _ state of the art _ of its astrometric capabilities , that we used for a number of scientific applications ( e.g.  from king et al .",
    "1998 , to bedin et al .",
    "2009 , first and last accepted papers ) . now that the _",
    "`` old '' _ acs / wfc is successfully repaired , and that the new instruments are installed , our first step is to extend our astrometric tools to the new instruments ( and to monitor the old ones ) .",
    "this paper is focused on the geometric distortion correction of the _ uv / optical _ _ ( uvis )",
    "_ channel of the wfc3 . since the results of these efforts might have some immediate public utility ( e.g.  relative astrometry in general , stacking of images , uv - identification of x - counterparts such as pulsars and cvs in globular clusters , etc . )",
    ", we made our results available to the wfc3/uvis user - community .",
    "we immediately focused our attention on a deep uv - survey of the core of the galactic globular cluster @xmath1  centauri ( ngc  5139 ) , where some well dithered images were collected .",
    "the dense and relatively flat stellar field makes the calibration particularly suitable for deriving and monitoring the gd on a relatively small spatial scale .",
    "in addition , while most of the efforts to derive a gd correction will be concentrated on relatively redder filters , we undertook a study to determine the gd solutions of the three bluest broad - band filters ( with the exception of f218w ) : f225w , f275 , and f336w .",
    "the wfc3/uvis layout is almost indistinguishable from that of acs / wfc :  two e2v thinned , backside illuminated and uv optimized 2k@xmath24k ccds contiguous on the long side of the chip , and covering a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath3@xmath2@xmath4 arcsec@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath1  cen data set used here consists of 9@xmath2350  s exposures in each of the filters f225w , f275w , and f336w .",
    "the nine images follow a squared 3@xmath23 dither - pattern with a step of about 40 arcsec ( i.e.  @xmath01000 pixels ) , and were all collected on july 15 , 2009 .",
    "we downloaded the standard pipe - line reduced flt files from the archive .",
    "the flt images are de - biased and flat - field corrected , but _ no _ pixel - resampling is performed on them .",
    "the flt files are multi - extension fits ( mef ) on which the first slot contains the image of what hereafter we will call chip 1 ( or simply [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the second chip , instead , is stored in the fourth slot of the mef , and we will refer to it as chip 2 ( or [ 2 ] ) . [ note that others might choose a different notation ] .",
    "our gd corrections refer to the raw pixel coordinates of these images .",
    "the fluxes and positions were obtained from a code mostly based on the software img2xym_wfi by anderson et al .",
    "this is essentially a spatially variable psf - fitting method .",
    "we were pleased to see that for the wfc3/uvis images of this data set the psfs were only marginally undersampled .",
    "left panel of figure  [ fig:0a ] shows a preliminary color - magnitude diagram in the three filters for the bright stars in the wfc3/uvis data set . in a future paper of this series",
    "we will discuss the psf , its spatial variation and stability , as well as l - flats , pixel - area corrections , and recipes for deep photometry in stacked - images .",
    "+     +     +",
    "the most straightforward way to solve for the gd would be to observe a field where there is a priori knowledge of the positions of all the stars in a distortion - free reference frame .",
    "[ a distortion - free reference frame is a system that can be transformed into any other distortion - free frame by means of _ conformal transformations . _ ] geometric distortion would then show itself immediately as the residuals between the observed relative positions of stars and the ones predicted by the distortion - free frame ( on the basis of a conformal transformation ) .",
    "thankfully , we possess such an `` astrometric flat - field '' , moreover with the right magnitude interval , source density , and accuracy .",
    "this reference frame is the mosaic of 3@xmath23 _ wide field channel ( wfc ) _ of the _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) _ fields collected  at the end of june 2002 under the program go-9442 ( pi :  cool ) reduced by jay anderson and published in villanova et al .",
    "this reference frame was obtained from a total of 18 short and 90 long acs / wfc exposures in the filters : f435w , f625w , and f658n ( see villanova et al .",
    "2007 for details ) .",
    "the entire field covers an area of 10@xmath210 arcmin@xmath5 , and can be considered distortion - free at the @xmath00.5 mas level .",
    "the catalog contains more than 2 million sources , and we will refer to it as _ master frame _ , and to the coordinates of each @xmath6-source in it with the notation ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) . a color - magnitude diagram for the stars in the master frame",
    "is shown on the right panel of figure  [ fig:0a ] .    to derive the wfc3/uvis gd corrections we closely follow the procedures described in anderson & king ( 2003 , hereafter ak03 ) used to correct the gd for each of the four detectors of wfpc2 .",
    "we represent our solution with a third - order polynomial , which is able to provide our final gd correction to the @xmath00.025 pixel level in each coordinate ( @xmath01 mas ) .",
    "higher orders proved to be unnecessary .    having a separate solution for each chip , rather than one that uses a common center of the distortion in the fov ,",
    "allows a better handle of potential individual detector effects ( such as a different relative tilt of the chip surfaces , relative motions , etc . ) .",
    "we adopted as the center of our solution , for each chip , the point @xmath9 [ in the raw pixel coordinates , to which we will refer hereafter as ( @xmath10 ) ] .    for each @xmath6-star of the master list",
    ", in each @xmath11-chip of each @xmath12-mef - file , the distortion _ corrected _ position ( @xmath13 ) is the observed position @xmath14 plus the distortion correction @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the normalized positions , defined as : @xmath19 normalized positions make it easier to recognize the magnitude of the contribution given by each solution term , and their numerical round - off .    the final gd correction for each star , in each chip / image ,",
    "is given by these two third - order polynomials ( we omitted here @xmath20 indexes for simplicity ) : @xmath21    our gd solution is thus fully characterized by 18 coefficients : @xmath22 , @xmath23 . however , as done in ak03 , we constrained the solution so that , at the center of the chip , it will have its @xmath24-scale equal to the one at the location @xmath25 , and the corrected axis @xmath26 has to be aligned with its @xmath27-axis at the location @xmath25 .",
    "this is obtained by imposing @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "since the detector axes do not necessarily have the same scales nor are perpendicular to each other , @xmath30 and @xmath31 must be free to assume whatever values fit best .",
    "therefore , we have to compute in fact only 16 coefficients ( for each chip ) to derive our gd solution .",
    "each @xmath6-star in the master frame is conformally transformed into each @xmath11-chip/@xmath12-image , and cross - identified with the closest source .",
    "we indicate such transformed positions with @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "each of such cross - identifications , when available ( of course not all the red sources in the master list were available in the wfc3 uv - filters ) , generates a pair of positional residuals : @xmath34 which reflect the residuals in the gd ( with the opposite sign ) , and depend on where the @xmath6-star fell on the @xmath35-chip / image ( plus random deviations due to non - perfect psf - fitting and photon noise ) .",
    "note that our calibration process is an iterative procedure , and that necessarily , at the first iteration , we have to impose @xmath36",
    "@xmath37 @xmath38 . in each chip /",
    "image we have typically @xmath05500 high - signal unsaturated stars in common with the master frame , leading to a total of @xmath050@xmath39000 residual pairs per chip . [ a color - magnitude diagram of the stars actually used to compute the gd solution is shown , for each filter , in fig.[fig:0b ] . ]    for each chip , these residuals were then collected into a look - up table made up of @xmath40 elements , each related to a region of @xmath41 pixels .",
    "we chose this particular grid setup because it offers the best compromise between the need for an adequate number of grid points to model the gd , and an adequate sampling of each grid element , containing at least 60 pairs of residuals .",
    "for each grid element , we computed a set of five 3@xmath42-clipped quantities : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ; where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the averaged positions of all the stars within the grid element @xmath48 of the @xmath11-chip , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the average residuals , and @xmath47 is the number of stars that were used to calculate the previous quantities .",
    "these @xmath47 will also serve in associating a weight to the grid cells when we fit the polynomial coefficients .    to obtain the 16 coefficients describing the two polynomials ( @xmath51 with @xmath52 , and @xmath53 with @xmath54 ) , which represent our gd solution in each chip , we perform a linear least - square fit of the @xmath55 data points .",
    "thus , for each chip , we can compute the average distortion correction in each cell ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) with @xmath58 relations of the form : @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 , @xmath61 ,  , @xmath62 ) , and where the 16 unknown quantities  @xmath51 and @xmath53  are our fitting parameters ( 16 for each chip ) .    in order to solve for @xmath51 and @xmath53 , we formed , for each chip , one @xmath63 matrix @xmath64 and two @xmath65 column vectors @xmath66 and @xmath67 : @xmath68 @xmath69    the solution is given by two @xmath65 column vectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 , containing the best fitting values for @xmath51 and @xmath53 , obtained as : @xmath72    with the first set of calculated coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath53 we computed the corrections @xmath73 and @xmath74 to be applied to each @xmath6-star of the @xmath11-chip in each @xmath12-mef file , but actually we corrected the positions only by half of the recommended values , to guarantee convergence . with the new improved star positions , we start - over and re - calculated new residuals .",
    "the procedure is iterated until the difference in the average correction from one iteration to the following one for each grid point became smaller than 0.001 pixels .",
    "convergence was reached after @xmath75 iterations .",
    "the coefficients of the final gd solutions for the two chips , and for the three different filters , are given in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "in figure  [ fig1 ] we show for the intermediate filter f275w the total residuals of uncorrected star positions vs.  the predicted positions of the master frame , which is representative of our gd solutions . for each chip",
    ", we plot the @xmath40 cells used to model the gd , each with its distortion vector magnified ( by a factor of @xmath28 in @xmath24 , and by a factor of @xmath21.5 in @xmath27 ) .",
    "residual vectors go from the average position of the stars belonging to each grid cell @xmath76 to the corrected one @xmath77 .",
    "side panels show the overall trends of the individual residuals @xmath78 , @xmath79 along @xmath24 and @xmath27 directions ( where for clarity we plot only a 40% sub - sample , randomly selected )",
    ". it immediately strikes the large linear terms in @xmath27 , reaching up to @xmath0140 pixels .    in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we show , in the same way , the remaining residuals after our gd solution is applied .",
    "this time we magnified the distortion vectors by a factor @xmath21500 in both axes .    at this point it is very interesting to examine the r.m.s .  of these remaining residuals , that show a rather large @xmath00.15 pixels dispersion .",
    "we will see , in the following , that this dispersion can be interpreted as the effect of the internal motions of the cluster stars on the time baseline of @xmath07 years between the acs / wfc observations of the reference frame , and the new wfc3/uvis data set .",
    "indeed , assuming 1 ) a distance of 4.7 kpc for @xmath1  cen ( van der marel & anderson 2009 ) , 2 ) an internal velocity dispersion of @xmath018 km s@xmath80 in our fields ( van de ven et al .",
    "2006 ) , and 3 ) an isotropic velocity distribution for stars , we would expect to observe in @xmath07 years a dispersion of the displacements of @xmath05.5 mas .",
    "this dispersion , assuming a pixel scale of @xmath040 mas for wfc3/uvis , corresponds to a displacement of @xmath00.14 pixels ( also in good agreement with the recent measurements by anderson & van der marel 2009 ) .    to show this more clearly we intercompare the average positions of the nine wfc3/uvis corrected catalogs in the filter f275w , with those in the f336w , for the stars in common between the two filters .",
    "all these images were taken at the same epoch , and so positions of stars are not affected by internal motion effects .",
    "the 1-dimension dispersion should reflect our accuracy , and indeed the observed residuals in this case have a dispersion of @xmath00.025 pixels ( i.e.  @xmath01 mas ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] illustrates the two situations . on the left - panel",
    "we plot the displacements between the acs / wfc epoch of the reference frame and the new wfc3/uvis epoch , while on the right - panel we show the displacements between our corrected position in filter f275w and the corrected positions in f336w . on the left - panel the internal motions of @xmath1  cen",
    "dominate the dispersion , while on the right - panel , there are no internal motions at all , and what we are left with are our errors only .",
    "unfortunately the wfc3/uvis images were either not enough , or not well dithered to perform a pure auto - calibration , and we had to use the acs / wfc reference frame .",
    "nevertheless , even a dispersion of 0.15 pixel within a given cell should be reduced to less than 0.02 pixels if averaged over more than 60 residuals . and",
    "this should be regarded as an upper limit , since we are using 703 grid points to constrain 16 parameters .",
    "for this reason , the estimated 0.025 pixel accuracy is larger than we would have expected .",
    "we can not exclude that these residuals could be due to a deviation from an isotropic distribution of the internal motion of @xmath1  cen ( i.e.  at the level of @xmath81 km s@xmath80 ) , or simply by unexpectedly large errors in the adopted acs / wfc astrometric flat - field ( the master frame ) .",
    "another possibility is that there could be some unexpected ( and so far undetected ) manufacturing artifact in the wfc3/uvis detectors which could affect the positions ( such as those identified on wfpc2 ccds , and characterized by anderson & king 1999 , or those of acs / wfc found by anderson 2002 ) .",
    "finally , it could simply be a higher frequency spatial variation which can not be properly represented by a polynomial of a reasonable order , but rather by a residual table as done in anderson ( 2006 ) for acs / wfc .",
    "surely , more data are needed to further improve the gd solutions presented in this work , as well as a better time - baseline for the understanding of its variations .",
    "we want to end this section by pointing out that the detection of the internal motions among the stars of a galactic globular cluster is a rather challenging measurement , and it could well be one of the best demonstrations of the goodness of our derived geometric distortion solutions .                 +     +     +     +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +     +",
    "by using a limited ( but best available ) number of exposures with large dithers , and an existing acs / wfc astrometric flat field , we have found a set of third - order correction coefficients to represent the geometric distortion of wfc3/uvis in three broad - band ultraviolet filters .",
    "the solution was derived independently for each of its two ccds .",
    "the use of these corrections removes the distortion over the entire area of each chip to an average accuracy of @xmath00.025 pixel ( i.e.@xmath01 mas ) , the largest systematics being located in the @xmath0200 pixels closest to the boundaries of the detectors ( and never exceeding 0.06 pixels ) .",
    "we advise the use of the inner parts of the detectors for high - precision astrometry .",
    "the limitation that has prevented us from removing the distortion at an even higher level of accuracy is the lack of enough observations collected at different roll - angles and dithers which could enable us to perform an auto - calibration .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison of the mid-2002 acs / wfc positions with the new wfc3 observations corrected with our astrometric solutions are good enough to clearly show the internal motions of @xmath1  centauri .",
    "these proved to be in perfect agreement with the most recent determinations .",
    "we also derived the average absolute scale of the detector with an accuracy limited by the uncertainties in the plate - scale variations induced by the velocity aberration of the telescope motion in the earth - sun system .",
    "we thank an anonymous ( and very competent ) referee for a careful reading , and for the useful corrections / suggestions .",
    "we thank giampaolo piotto for reading the manuscript , `` alcicci '' z.bonanos for polishing it , and george hartig for a useful discussion .",
