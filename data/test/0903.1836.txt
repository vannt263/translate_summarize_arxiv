    "the bouncing ball model consists of a classical particle of mass @xmath0 which is confined to bounce between two infinitely heavy and rigid walls @xcite .",
    "one of the walls is assumed to be fixed while the other one moves in time according to a periodic function .",
    "this model , also known as the fermi - ulam model ( fum ) , is a simple dynamical system that can be modeled using the formalism of discrete mappings .",
    "moreover , many tools developed to characterise such a model show to have great applicability in more complex mappings . considering the fum , many results are known in the literature . particularly for the particle suffering elastic collisions with either walls , it is known that the phase space of the model is of mixed kind @xcite in the sense that depending on the combination of both the control parameters and initial conditions , invariant spanning curves limiting the size of chaotic seas and kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) islands can all be observed . the presence of the invariant spanning curves yields in a limit for the energy gain of a bouncing particle , thus the fermi acceleration ( unlimited energy gain of the particle ) is not observed .",
    "a similar version of the model , called as bouncer @xcite , consists of a classical particle , in the presence of a constant gravitational field , suffering elastic collisions with a periodically moving platform .",
    "the returning mechanism of the bouncer model , a mechanism that injects the particle for a next collision with the moving wall , is rather distinct of the fum . in the bouncer ,",
    "it is due only to the gravitational field while in the fum it is given by a collision with a fixed wall .",
    "these differences yield in a profound consequence for the dynamics of a bouncing particle . depending on the control parameter",
    ", the unlimited energy gain is observed in the bouncer model , a phenomenon that is not present in fum with periodic and smooth oscillations .",
    "the differences were clarified by lichtenberg , lieberman and cohen @xcite .",
    "hybrid versions of the fum and bouncer were recently studied @xcite as well as a stochastic version of the fum @xcite .",
    "there are also many important results concerning the inclusion of damping forces on both the models ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for a short review ) .",
    "one of them is the presence of a drag force @xcite , so that the particle is moving inside a gas with the dissipation acting on the particle along its trajectory .",
    "the dynamics of the problem is , generally , given by a nonlinear mapping that is obtained via the solution of newton s law .",
    "a different kind of dissipation can be introduced via inelastic hits of the particle with the walls .",
    "thus , there is a restitution coefficient that makes the particle experiences a fractional loss of energy upon collisions . despite both kinds of damping often occur in nature , they have profound and different consequences in the dynamics of the models . as an example , in refs . @xcite and considering inelastic collisions , tsang and lieberman considered the simplified fum ( both the walls are fixed but the particle changes energy and momentum upon collisions with one of the wall as if the wall were moving ) with inelastic impacts .",
    "they have evidenced contraction on the phase space and in particular , observed the presence of a strange attractor .",
    "recently , a rather similar version of the dissipative model @xcite , confirmed the property of area contraction and in addition , a boundary crisis was characterised .",
    "additionally , a family of boundary crisis was observed when collisions with the two walls are inelastic @xcite .",
    "the bouncer model was also considered under inelastic collisions .",
    "for example , in @xcite holmes discusses the appearances of horseshoes in the inelastic bouncer and gave an illustration of a homoclinic orbit in such a model .",
    "after that , everson @xcite presents and discusses with many numerical simulations the appearance of period doubling cascade in the damping bouncer model .",
    "period doubling cascade was also observed in @xcite for the completely inelastic collisions .",
    "the presence of frictional force however was considered by luna - acosta @xcite and naylor , sanchz and swift @xcite in the bouncer model .",
    "they too observed period doubling cascades and in special luna - acosta @xcite has achieved analytically dimensional reduction for the limit of high dissipation .    in this letter , we study a non dissipative version of a bouncing ball model seeking to understand and describe some of its dynamical properties considering however that the motion of the moving wall is given via a crank - connecting rod scheme .",
    "for such a scheme , it is known that there are two nonlinearities present in the model and each of them play important rules in the dynamics .",
    "depending on certain ranges of control parameters , there can be profound consequences on the dynamics of the system .",
    "particularly , when one of the two control parameters is raised , the positive lyapunov exponent experiences a drastic reduction .",
    "it is also important to say that the particle is in the total absence of any external field .",
    "other important result for this model is that it yields , for specific control parameter values , the phenomenon of fermi acceleration ( unlimited energy growth ) .",
    "the phenomenon is characterised , for the first time in the present model , in terms of a discontinuity of the derivative of the wall s position with respect to the time , thus leading the particle to acquire unlimited energy gain .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we present the model and the expressions of the mapping that fully describes the dynamics of the system .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is also devoted to a discussion of the numerical results and the behaviour of the positive lyapunov exponent . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we propose a simplified version of the model and study the behaviour of the average velocity as function of a control parameter .",
    "we show that fermi acceleration emerges naturally from the deterministic dynamics of the model for specific control parameter values .",
    "final remarks and conclusions are drawn in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the model is described using a two dimensional mapping for the variables @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the corresponding velocity of the particle and time immediately after the n@xmath4 collision with the moving wall .",
    "we assume that one wall is fixed at @xmath5 and that the motion of the moving wall is given by @xmath6 ( we stress the term @xmath7 in the equation of @xmath8 is represented by the variable @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , where @xmath10 denotes the radii of the crank , @xmath11 is the length of the connecting rod and @xmath12 is the corresponding frequency of oscillation .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the model under consideration .",
    "we stress the equation for @xmath8 is easily obtained from the condition of @xmath13 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .        before we write the equations of the mapping ,",
    "let us first discuss the initial conditions .",
    "we assume that , at a time @xmath14 , the particle is at the position @xmath15 with velocity @xmath16 .",
    "thus such an initial condition can be considered as if the dynamics were already running in the system along the time .",
    "we emphasise that two different kinds of collisions can be observed namely : ( i ) multiple hits with the moving wall and ( ii ) a single hit with the moving wall . in case ( i ) , the particle suffers a collision with the moving wall but then , before it leaves the collision zone , which is defined as @xmath17 $ ] , the particle experiences a second and then successive impact with the moving wall .",
    "such kind of collisions becomes rare in the limit of high energy but they are quite often to be observed in the regime of low energy .",
    "it is also easy to see that there are too many control parameters in the model , 4 in total , namely @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath18 and @xmath12 and that the dynamics of the system does not depend on all of them .",
    "it is convenient to define dimensionless and more appropriated variables .",
    "we define @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and measure the time in terms of the number of oscillations of the moving wall @xmath22 . for the dimensionless variables , we consider that the range for @xmath23 is @xmath24 $ ] and for @xmath25 is @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the limit of @xmath27 corresponds to @xmath28 and @xmath29 is obtained for @xmath30 . with this new set of variables , the mapping that describes the dynamics of the system",
    "is written as @xmath31~~{\\rm mod ( 2\\pi)}\\\\ v_{n+1}=v_n^*-2\\epsilon\\sin(\\phi_{n+1})\\left[1+{{r\\cos(\\phi_{n+1 } ) } \\over { \\sqrt { 1-r^2\\sin^ 2(\\phi_{n+1})}}}\\right]\\\\ \\end{array } \\right .",

    "let us now consider the case where the particle leaves the collision zone , i.e. case ( ii ) .",

    "we can clearly see that the shape of the phase space changes as the control parameter @xmath25 varies . on the other hand ,",
    "the mixed form is preserved in the sense that a large chaotic sea , which surrounds kam islands , is limited by a set of invariant spanning curves .",
    "one can also note that the position of the lowest invariant spanning curve raises as the control parameter @xmath25 increases . in our simulations",
    "we will consider values for @xmath25 that may approaches the unity , moreover in the range of @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "however for a real experimental system , in which damping forces can not be neglected , such values for @xmath25 have no much interest .",
    "this is mainly because the damping force can acquires larger values as compared to the component of the force with respect to the motion ( for instance , it happens for large values of the angle @xmath55 ) and therefore , lead the system to reach the rest .",
    "the two natural questions that we are interested in concern on the properties of the chaotic sea ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) , like the positive lyapunov exponent and the average velocity of the particle . our main goal is to describe their behaviour as function of the control parameter @xmath25 .",
    "we think this study is of interest because the control parameter @xmath25 directly controls the straight of a nonlinearity of the model . for small values of @xmath25",
    ", results of the fum should be obtained .",
    "moreover , we expect that the results obtained for @xmath29 contribute towards a better understanding of this model for such a range of @xmath25 and , in particular as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , in a description of the phenomenon of fermi acceleration .",
    "the behaviour of the lyapunov exponent is described in this section while the average velocity is discussed in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "we concentrate to investigate the behaviour of the positive lyapunov exponent for the chaotic sea .",
    "it is well known that the lyapunov exponent is commonly used as a tool to characterise sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "figure [ fig3 ]     and @xmath51 .",
    "]    shows the asymptotic convergence of the positive lyapunov exponent for the control parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the ensemble average of @xmath56 different initial conditions randomly chosen along the chaotic sea gives @xmath57 , where the error @xmath58 denotes the standard deviation of the ten samples .",
    "each initial condition was iterated up to @xmath59 collisions with the moving wall .",
    "the method used to obtain the lyapunov exponents is described in the appendix .",
    "let us discuss the behaviour of the positive lyapunov exponent as function of @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows     for a fixed @xmath50 . ]",
    "the behaviour of @xmath60 .",
    "we can see that , in the limit of @xmath27 , the positive lyapunov exponent recovers the value of the one - dimensional fermi accelerator model @xcite .",
    "the positive lyapunov exponent then grows slightly , having a maximum value around @xmath61 and then decreases almost monotonically until around @xmath62 .",
    "then it starts grow again until @xmath63 when it suddenly decreases .",
    "other abrupt change is observed for @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the two main questions that arise from fig . [ fig4 ] are : ( i ) why does the positive lyapunov exponent decreases in the average , instead of growth , as @xmath25 raises ?",
    "( ii ) what is the explanation of the abrupt changes in @xmath65 ?",
    "the answer for question ( i ) comes from the shape of the function that describes the motion of the moving wall .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows     for two periods in @xmath9 considering the control parameters @xmath50 and : ( a ) @xmath51 , ( b ) @xmath66 , ( c ) @xmath67 and ( d ) @xmath68 . ]    four different plots of @xmath69 ( for sake of clarity , we show two periods in @xmath9 for @xmath70 ) , which describes the motion of the moving wall for four different values of @xmath25 namely : ( a ) @xmath51 , ( b ) @xmath66 , ( c ) @xmath67 and ( d ) @xmath68 . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the function looks like a cosine function but as @xmath25 increases , the shape changes substantially .",
    "it thus become to have two regimes of variation where one of them is characterised by a constant plateau in the limit of @xmath29 , as can be seen in the range of @xmath71 and a regime of fast variation , which is given by the complementary values of @xmath9 . in the limit case of @xmath72 , the function",
    "@xmath70 has indeed discontinuities in its derivative for two values of @xmath9 , namely @xmath73 and @xmath74 . as we will see in the next section , the discontinuities for @xmath70 yield a profound consequence in the dynamics of the system thus leading the particle to exhibit unlimited energy growth .",
    "the large plateaus imply that the particle , when suffers collisions with the moving wall does not change substantially its velocity value since such plateaus lead in an `` almost '' null velocity for the moving wall .",
    "thus the time that the particle spends until a next hit with the moving wall is almost the same as it spent in the previous collisions .",
    "it then implies that the particle , in a chaotic orbit , can experience many more collisions with the moving wall without substantially changing its energy as it would experiences if the plateaus were absent .",
    "then , the form of @xmath70 for large values of @xmath25 yields in reducing the chaoticity of the system in the average .    we will now discuss a possible answer for question ( ii ) , i.e. , the explanation of the sudden changes in @xmath65 .",
    "they are basically related to the destruction of the lowest energy invariant spanning curve together with a destruction of small chaotic layers .",
    "considering the case of low energy and for @xmath75 , the system has a large chaotic sea ( the black region of fig . [",
    "fig6](c ) ) which shares boundary with a thin chaotic layer ( the red region of fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) ) , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "different initial conditions for the control parameters @xmath50 and @xmath75 .",
    "( b ) iteration of a single initial condition , evidencing the chaotic behaviour , for @xmath50 and @xmath76 .",
    "( c ) zoom in of part ( a ) where it is easy to see an invariant spanning curve and chaotic layers . ]    above this chaotic layer , there is an invariant spanning curve ( brown curve of fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) ) . above",
    "yet of such curve we can see two thin chaotic layers ( light blue and dark blue ) and a relatively large chaotic sea ( green region ) surrounding a kam island ( see for instance fig . [",
    "fig2](c ) ) .",
    "each of these chaotic regions were characterised in terms of lyapunov exponents .",
    "their corresponding values were : for the black region we obtained @xmath77 ; for the red region @xmath78 ; for the light blue @xmath79 ; for the dark blue @xmath80 and for the green region @xmath81 . for @xmath76 , which is quite close to @xmath75 , those regions shown in fig . [ fig6](a ) were all merged into a single and large chaotic sea characterised by a positive lyapunov exponent @xmath82 .",
    "the merged regions are shown in fig . [ fig6](b ) .",
    "after the destruction of the thin structures shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , the chaotic sea in the low energy region can spreads over a larger accessible region of the phase space .",
    "so we can consider that , after the transition , the positive lyapunov exponent could be obtained by an average of the previous values for the corresponding chaotic regions therefore taking into account the fraction of area occupied individually by each region . to check whether this supposition is correct ,",
    "we have obtained the fraction of each chaotic region previous to the control parameter variation i.e. for @xmath75 .",
    "we have defined a grid of @xmath83 initial conditions for the @xmath9-axis , limited to the interval @xmath84 , and @xmath85 for the @xmath86-axis considering the interval @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "the value @xmath88 corresponds to the higher value of the velocity obtained for the chaotic sea shown in the green region of fig . [",
    "fig6](c ) .",
    "thus in the total , we considered @xmath89 different initial conditions .",
    "each of them were evolved in time for @xmath90 collisions with the moving wall and their lyapunov exponents evaluated .",
    "the obtained value was compared to the lyapunov exponent of the chaotic regions so that we were able to compare the corresponding fraction of initial conditions which belongs to one region or to another one . applying this procedure for all the chaotic regions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) , we found that the black chaotic sea fills a fraction of @xmath91 of the entire chaotic region .",
    "the red region corresponds to @xmath92 , when the light blue has a fraction of @xmath93 , the dark blue is @xmath94 and finally the green region corresponds to a fraction of @xmath95 . after the transition",
    ", we could assume that the positive lyapunov exponent is obtained by @xmath96 evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eqnew ] ) we found @xmath97 which is a rather acceptable value as compared to the value obtained via numerical simulation of the chaotic sea after the destruction @xmath82 .",
    "the abrupt change in @xmath65 around the value of @xmath98 is explained by using the same arguments .",
    "we stress that similar results were observed in a rather distinct model @xcite .",
    "other important conclusion that arises from the shape of the function @xmath70 is related to the energy gain of the bouncing particle . as @xmath25 approaches the unity ,",
    "the variation of the moving wall position becomes more fast for specific ranges of @xmath9 .",
    "it implies that the particle can acquires , for specific ranges of @xmath9 , large values of velocity upon collisions with the moving wall for those regions of fast variation of @xmath70 .",
    "such a result can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by the position of the lowest energy invariant spanning curve which assume higher values as the control parameter @xmath25 raises .",
    "to illustrate such an argument more clearly , it is important to look at the behaviour of the average velocity for sufficiently long time . to do this",
    ", we will make use of a simplification in the mapping ( [ eq1 ] ) with the main goal of speeding up our numerical simulations and avoid solving the equations @xmath37 and @xmath45 .",
    "this simplification , which is commonly used in the literature ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , consists in assume that both walls are fixed . however , when the particle hits one of them , it exchanges energy and momentum as if the wall were moving .",
    "this procedure retains the nonlinearity of the problem and yields a huge advantage of avoid solving transcendental equations .",
    "the mapping is then given by @xmath99~~{\\rm mod ( 2\\pi)}\\\\ v_{n+1}=\\left|v_n-2\\epsilon\\sin(\\phi_{n+1})\\left[1+{{r\\cos(\\phi_{n+1 } ) } \\over { \\sqrt { 1-r^2\\sin^ 2(\\phi_{n+1})}}}\\right]\\right|\\\\ \\end{array } \\right .. \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] although this simplification brings the advantage of allowing very fast simulations as compared to those of the complete version , it also gives rise to a problem that we need to avoid . in the complete model ,",
    "depending on the combination of both velocity and phase of the moving wall , it is possible for the particle , after suffering a collision with the time varying wall , to suffer a second successive collision before exiting the collision area , as well as possibly having a negative velocity following the first such a collision . in the simplified model ,",
    "non - positive velocities are forbidden because they are equivalent to the particle travelling beyond the wall . in order to avoid such problems , if after the collision the particle has a negative velocity , we inject it back with the same modulus of velocity .",
    "such a procedure is effected perfectly by the use of a modulus function .",
    "note that the velocity of the particle is reversed by the modulus function only if , after the collision , the particle remains travelling in the negative direction .",
    "the modulus function has no effect on the motion of the particle if it moves in the positive direction after the collision .",
    "we stress that this approximation is valid only for small values of @xmath23 .",
    "we now discuss the procedure used to obtain the average velocity of the particle .",
    "firstly we obtain the average velocity proceeding with an average over the orbit , i.e. @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the number of collisions .",
    "the second average is made in an ensemble of @xmath102 different initial conditions so that the average value is defined as @xmath103 with @xmath104 corresponding to a sample in an ensemble of @xmath105 different initial conditions .",
    "figure [ fig7](a ) shows     for the control parameters @xmath106 and @xmath50 .",

    "the behaviour of @xmath108 for the control parameters @xmath50 and @xmath106 considering @xmath90 iterations .",
    "we can see that the velocity of the particle grows for short iterations and then suddenly it bends towards a regime of saturation for sufficiently long time .",
    "moreover , we are interested in the behaviour of the asymptotic values of @xmath109 .",
    "figure [ fig7](b ) shows the behaviour of @xmath110 for long iterations , which we will referr to it as @xmath111 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath111 can be described for two different ranges of @xmath25 .",
    "the first range is for @xmath112 where we can see that @xmath111 is almost constant for the region of @xmath113 .",
    "the second range of @xmath25 is considered for @xmath114 .",
    "it is important to say that , when @xmath72 the expression of the `` moving wall '' velocity presents discontinuities for @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "thus , it is convenient to define a new parameter @xmath115 and then study the behaviour of @xmath111 as a function of @xmath116 .",
    "this new control parameter has a practical application because it brings the criticality of the model to @xmath117 .",

    "we can describe such a behaviour according to @xmath120 after fitting a power law in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we obtain @xmath118 .",
    "this kind of behaviour for @xmath111 confirms that , in the limit of @xmath29 , the present model shows the phenomenon of fermi acceleration .",
    "this result has a clear explanation in terms of the kam theorem .",
    "as it was discussed by lichtenberg , lieberman and cohen @xcite , if the expression of the periodic wall s velocity has a sufficient number of continuous derivatives , then it is possible to obtain invariant spanning curves separating different portions of the phase space .",
    "particularly they are useful to prevent unlimited energy growth for a bouncing particle .",
    "moreover , it was estimated by moser @xcite that three continuous derivatives for the moving wall velocity is a sufficient condition for the existence of kam surfaces ( by instance , invariant spanning curves ) . however , in the present model and considering the limit of @xmath29 , the expression of the velocity shows discontinuities for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , so that the invariant spanning curves are not observed for @xmath72 and consequently , fermi acceleration is present .",
    "in summary , we have studied a non dissipative version of a classical bouncing ball model under the presence of two nonlinearities .",
    "our results show that , as one of the two control parameters varies , the positive lyapunov exponent diminish in the average and experiences sudden changes .",
    "we have explained such a behaviour by the shape of the moving wall and due to the destruction of invariant spanning curves and thin chaotic layers .",
    "we have also shown that in the limit of @xmath121 , the present model exhibits unlimited energy growth .",
    "this phenomenon was explained by using a discontinuity of the moving wall s velocity .",

    "in this section , we briefly discuss the procedure used to obtain the lyapunov exponents . in effect , the procedure consists in evolving the system over a long time from two slightly different initial conditions .",
    "if the two trajectories diverge exponentially in time the orbit is called chaotic , and the lyapunov exponent obtained is positive . if the lyapunov exponent is negative , the orbit may be either periodic or quasi - periodic .",
    "let us now describe the procedure used to obtain the lyapunov exponents numerically .",
    "they are defined as @xcite @xmath122 where @xmath123 are the eigenvalues of @xmath124 and @xmath125 is the jacobian matrix evaluated over the orbit @xmath126 .",
    "the jacobian matrix is defined as @xmath127 in order to evaluate the eigenvalues of @xmath105 , we use the fact that @xmath128 can be written as a product of @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is an orthogonal matrix and @xmath131 is a right upper triangular one .",
    "we now define the elements of these matrices as @xmath132 since @xmath105 is defined as @xmath133 , we can introduce the identity operator , rewrite @xmath105 as @xmath134 , and define @xmath135 . the product @xmath136 defines a new matrix @xmath137 . in a following step ,",
    "we may write @xmath105 as @xmath138 . the same procedure yields @xmath139 .",
    "the problem is thus reduced to the evaluation of the diagonal elements of @xmath140 . using the @xmath130 and @xmath131 matrices",
    ", we find the eigenvalues of @xmath105 , given by @xmath141 we can then evaluate the lyapunov exponent using the relation @xmath142 it is interesting to observe that @xmath143 , because the map is measure - preserving ."
