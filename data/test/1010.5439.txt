    "the heavy ion jet interacting generator ( hijing ) @xcite and hijing / bb v1.10 models @xcite have been used extensively to study particle production in @xmath8 collisions and to determine the physical properties of the ultra - dense matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . in the lund @xcite and dual - parton ( dpm ) @xcite models",
    "multi qcd strings or flux tubes were proposed to describe soft multiparticle production in longitudinal color fields .",
    "color exchange between high @xmath10 partons in the projectile and target create confined color flux tubes of tension ( @xmath11 gev / fm ) , that must neutralize through pair production or color singlet hadronization approximately uniformly in rapidity . in nucleus - nucleus collisions , the @xmath12 enhancement of the local parton density of high @xmath10 partons allows for higher color casimir representations to be excited . those flux tubes with stronger longitudinal color fields than in average @xmath8 reactions",
    "have been called color ropes @xcite and naturally have higher string tensions @xcite . recently",

    "hard collisions are included with standard perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) as programmed in the pythia generator @xcite .",
    "however , hijing differs from pythia by the incusion of a geometric scaling multiple jet production model .",
    "thus this model contains both longitudinal field induced _ soft _ beam jet multiparticle production and collinear factorized pqcd based _ hard _ multiple jet production for @xmath13 gev / c .    a systematic comparison with data on @xmath8 and @xmath9 collisions in a wide energy range @xcite revealed that minijet production and fragmentation as implemented in the hijing model provide a simultaneous and consistent explanation of several effects : the inclusive spectra at moderate transverse momentum ( @xmath14 ) ; the energy dependence of the central rapidity density ; the two particle correlation function ; and the degree of violation of koba - nielsen - olesen ( kno ) scaling @xcite , @xcite up to tevatron energy ( @xmath15 tev ) .",
    "however , the model failed to describe the dependence of the mean value of transverse momentum ( @xmath16 ) on charged particle multiplicity ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "wang argued @xcite that by requiring high @xmath17 within a limited pseudorapidity ( @xmath18 ) range one necessarily biases the data towards higher @xmath14 minijets , hence the observed increase of @xmath16 versus ( vs. ) @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this effect has also been associated with the presence of transverse flow of the hadronic matter @xcite and was proposed as possibly due to _ quark - gluon plasma _",

    "initial states of color gauge fields produced in high - energy heavy - ion collisions have also recently been discussed in ref .",
    "decay of a strong color electric field ( scf ) ( @xmath19=@xmath20 v / m ) due to the schwinger mechanisms @xcite plays an important role at the initial stage of heavy - ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "a thermalization scenario based on the analogy between schwinger mechanisms and the hawking - unruh effect has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it was also suggested that the back - reaction and screening effects of quark and anti - quark pairs on external electric field could even lead to the phenomenon of plasma oscillations @xcite .",

    "it was concluded that particles with large momentum were likely to have been created earlier , and for very short temporal widths ( @xmath21 , where the compton time @xmath22 ) and as a consequence the schwinger formula could underestimate the reachable particle number density . in previous papers",
    ", we have shown that the dynamics of strangeness production in @xmath8 and au + au collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energies deviates considerably from calculations based on schwinger - like estimates for homogeneous and constant color fields and point to the contribution of fluctuations of transient strong color fields ( scf ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend our study of the dynamic consequences of scf in the framework of the hijing / bb v2.0 model @xcite to particle production in hadron - hadron collisions at lhc energies .",

    "our study aims to investigate a broad set of observables sensitive to the dynamics of the collisions , covering both longitudinal and transverse degree of freedom .",

    "in hijing / bb v2.0 , in addition to conventional quark - diquark longitudinal electric fields , novel color flux topology junction anti - junction ( jj ) loops are also implemented . in a dual superconductor model of color confinement for the three - quark positioning in a y - geometry ,",
    "the flux tubes converge first toward the center of the triangle and there is also another component that runs in the opposite direction ( like a _ mercedes star _ ) @xcite .",
    "unlike the conventional diquark - quark implemented in lund and the hijing model @xcite , the hijing / bb v1.10 @xcite model allows the diquark - quark to split with the three independent flux lines tied together with an @xmath25 a junction and terminating on three delocalized fundamental casimir quarks . we introduced @xcite a new version ( v2.0 ) of hijing / bb that differs from hijing / bb v1.10 @xcite in its implementation of additional more complex flux topologies via junction anti - junction ( jj ) loops .",
    "we parametrize the probability that a junction loop occurs in the string .",
    "moreover , we enhance the intrinsic ( anti)diquark - quark @xmath14 kick ( by a factor @xmath26 = 3 ) of all ( @xmath27-qq ) strings that contain one or multiple jj loops .",
    "the reason for this is the mechanism behind the dynamic of diquark - quark breaking ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    in string fragmentation phenomenology",

    "saturation physics is based on the observation that small - x hadronic and nuclear wave functions , and , thus the scattering cross sections as well , are described by the same internal momentum scale known as the _ saturation scale _ ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "a recent analysis of @xmath8 data up to lhc 7 tev has shown that , with the @xmath60 factorized ( glr ) gluon fusion approximation @xcite , the growth of the @xmath5 can be accounted for if the saturation scale grows with c.m.s . energy as @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "the saturation scale is also increasing with atomic number as @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the effective string tension ( @xmath58 ) of color ropes should scale with @xmath64 @xcite .",
