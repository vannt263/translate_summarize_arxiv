    "one of the major breakthroughs in astronomy has been the discovery of high energy neutrinos by the icecube detector at the south pole .",
    "the story started with two pev neutrino events announced in 2012  @xcite as a consequence of changing the search strategy , over 28  events with deposited energies greater than 30  tev announced in 2013  @xcite , to 37  events in the current three year data analysis  @xcite . while about 15 of these 37 events are expected from the backgrounds of atmospheric muons and neutrinos , the excess over the background currently constitutes more than @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , high - energy neutrino astronomy is emerging as a new discipline with icecube at the forefront , which is expected to collect 100 - 200 events ( within the current analysis scheme ) during its lifetime .",
    "while this is significant statistics , it may not be sufficient for resolving individual sources  @xcite and for precision studies of spectrum and flavor composition .",
    "therefore , the next generation experiments are being discussed , such as a volume upgrade of the icecube detector ( icecube high - energy extension hex ) and the km3net experiment in the mediterranean  @xcite .",
    "the results of the icecube experiment during this and the coming years will have to serve as input for the optimization of these future options .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "there have been many speculations where these neutrinos would be coming from , see _",
    "e.g. _  ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "it is probably fair to say that there is no general answer on that question yet . instead ,",
    "the current state - of - the - art can be recast in a number of conceptual questions :    * what is the role of atmospheric neutrinos , especially prompt neutrinos ? * are there any directional or time - wise clusters , or is the flux isotropic ? are there any correlations with known objects or events ? * are some of the events of galactic origin ? * why are there no events above a few pev ?",
    "* can the neutrinos stem from the sources of the ultra - high energy cosmic rays ? * are the observed neutrinos coming from one source class or more ? which ones ?",
    "* is the flavor composition what is expected , or are there deviations indicative for either physics beyond the standard model or non - conventional compositions at the source ?",
    "* is there a particle physics origin of these neutrinos , such as dark matter ?    in this study , we focus on the conceptual interpretation of the observed events in terms of the spectral shape of the observed flux .",
    "that is , we assume that the neutrinos come from one source population with similar properties which is of extra - galactic origin , as there is not yet any evidence for directional clusters .",
    "we furthermore assume that the source population is cosmologically distributed such that it roughly follows the star formation rate .",
    "we postulate that the neutrinos are produced from interactions between nuclei and matter .",
    "this is , in a way , the simplest possible class of models , as the neutrino spectrum directly follows the non - thermal spectrum of the accelerated nuclei ; for interactions with radiation , the obtained spectral shape of the neutrinos depends on both the spectra of the interacting nuclei and the target photons , see _",
    "e.g. _  ref .",
    "@xcite for target photons produced by synchrotron radiation of co - accelerated electrons .",
    "however , we do take into account magnetic field effects on the secondary muons and pions , which can significantly alter the neutrino spectra and flavor composition , see _",
    "e.g. _  refs .",
    "@xcite especially in the context of gamma - ray bursts  @xcite and microquasars  @xcite ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "while most of these studies discuss interactions between protons and photons , the secondaries produced by interactions between nuclei and matter will be affected by magnetic fields as well , see _",
    "e.g. _  ref .",
    "@xcite . in the context of a possible cutoff at pev energies in recent icecube observations ,",
    "magnetic field effects on the secondaries may be a way to decouple the maximal proton from the maximal neutrino energy , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "finally , there seems to be condensing evidence for a heavier composition of the uhecrs  @xcite .",
    "we therefore take into account the composition of the nuclei in the sources .",
    "we especially discuss if the cutoff at pev neutrino energies can be consistent with the uhecr paradigm if heavier nuclei are accelerated to higher energies within the sources .",
    "in fact , we will demonstrate that one can learn something about the acceleration mechanism in that scenario .",
    "note that the interpretation of the obtained neutrino flux normalization in terms of source luminosity and column depth will be discussed elsewhere .",

    "see ref .",
    "the secondary production @xmath2 [ @xmath3 is given from the non - thermal nucleon density in the source @xmath4 [ @xmath5 and the target nucleon density @xmath6 [ @xmath7 by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fraction of the nucleus energy going into the neutrino and @xmath10 are the scaling functions from ref .",
    "@xcite ( sibyll - based versions ) and @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "if the target material is heavier than hydrogen , one may superimpose the nuclei @xmath12 .",
    "there are , however , corrections to that , but , as we do not discuss the normalization in this study , that does not affect our results .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ equ : int ] ) can be re - written in terms of the column density @xmath13 , where the interpretation of @xmath14 in terms of the size of the interaction region depends on the scenario .",
    "for example , injecting nuclei into the interaction region with the rate @xmath15 , one can estimate that @xmath16 in the absence of disintegration and cooling , and therefore @xmath17 is the column density which determines the normalization of eq .",

    "the pion and consequent muon decays are computed in the usual way including the helicity dependence of the muon decays , see ref .",

    "@xcite ( first octant solution ) .",
    "the main parameters of the model are listed in tab .",

    "we start with @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : int ] ) , where @xmath19 is the initial spectral index , which is expected to be @xmath20 from fermi shock acceleration .",
    "the maximal energy @xmath21 is typically obtained from equating the acceleration timescale with the dominant escape and energy loss timescales in a specific scenario . since",
    "this derivation is highly model - dependent , we keep @xmath21 as a model parameter . note that @xmath21 can also be used to simulate a spectral break in the initial spectrum , as it may come from an energy - dependent escape time frequently discussed for starburst galaxies  @xcite , see also refs .  @xcite . in addition , in eq .",
    "( [ equ : int ] ) , @xmath4 already corresponds to the result including disintegration and other cooling and escape processes .",
    "that means that @xmath21 could also describe a spectral break from a cooling process , energy - dependent escape , or photo - disintegration .",
    "the secondary muons and pions are assumed to undergo synchrotron losses and decay governed by the magnetic field @xmath22 , which impacts spectral shape and flavor composition see refs .",
    "note that there could be other cooling or escape processes affecting the secondaries , such as adiabatic cooling ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) or re - acceleration  @xcite .",
    "these effects are , however , model - dependent and typically not the dominant ones shaping the neutrino spectra .",
    "finally , we have the composition @xmath23 as parameter .",
    "in fact , eq .",
    "( [ equ : int ] ) allows to use an energy - dependent ( average ) composition @xmath24 , which we will use below .",
    "note that for a power law with @xmath25 , the composition would not affect our results .",
    "however , both the cutoff and varying composition will change that conclusion .    for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we furthermore assume that the sources do not have large doppler factors , and that they are cosmologically distributed following the star formation rate by hopkins and beacom  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , @xmath26 for steady sources with @xmath27 the source density normalized to the local source density ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for transients , there will be another factor @xmath31 in the denominator of the integrand ; we find however that the results depend very little on the details of the cosmological source distribution .    for the fit , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite , using the up - to - date three year data from ref .  @xcite .",
    "we use eight bins : four in the _ reconstructed _ neutrino energy 30 to 200  tev , 200 tev to 1 pev , 1 to 3 pev , and 3 pev to 100 pev , and one bin for muon tracks and cascades within each energy slot . for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the electromagnetic equivalent energy is roughly 25% of the incident neutrino energy for a muon track , and 75% for a cascade  @xcite ; cascades from neutral current interactions are assumed to be suppressed by the cross sections , the lower fiducial mass ( see fig .  7 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the fact that only a fraction of the initial neutrino energy is deposited in the detector  @xcite .",
    "the ( poissonian ) @xmath32 is obtained by bin - wise comparing the observed 36  events , for which energy information is available , with the prediction . the prediction with a free overall normalization",
    "is obtained from folding the three flavored neutrino fluxes for one set of model parameters with the corresponding exposures derived from the effective areas in ref .",
    ". then the atmospheric backgrounds are added .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino background is derived from the icecube observation of muon neutrinos  @xcite , and for the atmospheric muons we assume the same shape .",
    "the measurement of the atmospheric electron neutrino background is much more uncertain .",
    "we therefore extrapolate it from the muon neutrino background , roughly consistent with the flavor composition in @xcite .",
    "we obtain 3.6 background muon tracks from neutrinos , 3.2 cascades from neutrinos , and 8.6 muon tracks from atmospheric muons , matching the publically available information on the icecube analysis .",
    "this means that the predicted number of muon tracks is slightly higher than the observation ( eight ) , a fact which discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for some discussion ) .",
    "while this unavoidable tension increases the minimal @xmath32 of our fit , it hardly affects the @xmath33 , and therefore if of little relevance for the results in this study . as a final step the @xmath32 between predicted and observed rates",
    "are summed over all bins and minimized over the free normalization of the astrophysical flux to obtain the best - fit for the chosen parameters .",
    "here we first reproduce the icecube spectral fit in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on a sub - sample of the 37 events with @xmath34 .",
    "all following figures will be based on the full data sample . in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , the allowed fit region ( filled contours ) are shown for in a three parameter ( @xmath19 , @xmath22 , @xmath21 ) model for protons only , where one of the parameters is fixed in each panel .",
    "most noteworthy , for @xmath35 , we obtain a spectral index @xmath36 in consistency with the collaboration results .",
    "thus , although our procedure qualitatively deviates from internal analyses of the icecube collaboration in a few ways ( _ e.g. _ , mapping from deposited to reconstructed energy / energy reconstruction , details on background model , systematical errors ) , we can roughly reproduce their results in order to test more complicated models .",
    "for instance , one can read off from this figure that @xmath21 and @xmath22 can produce a cutoff as alternative to softer spectra .",
    "for instance , strong enough @xmath22 , a spectral index @xmath25 is allowed .",
    "note that in the following , we will use the full set of events to make the full use of statistics .",
    "an interesting observation was made by murase , ahlers , and lacki ( mal )  @xcite : the production of gamma - rays from @xmath37 decays in the sources , which are co - produced with the charged pions , may violate the fermi isotropic background measurements  @xcite .",
    "the highest energy data points are at about 100  gev , which is significantly below the measured neutrino energies and requires some extrapolation of the spectrum . in addition",
    ", gamma - rays may come from higher energies by the initiated electromagnetic cascade . while the details are somewhat model - dependent",
    ", we compute the gamma - ray flux injected at the sources based on ref .",
    "we add a penalty @xmath32 , imposing that @xmath38 , _",
    "i.e. _ , an upper bound .",
    "the effect of this penalty can be seen as dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] : it leads to a lower cutoff @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath41 was found . note that for the chosen star formation evolution of the sources , the main contribution will come from @xmath42 , where the optical depth at @xmath43 is still small enough such that most gamma - rays can reach us without being attenuated in photon background fields during their propagation .",
    "however , the gamma - ray constraint can be at least partially avoided if a spectral break or lower cutoff in the energy spectrum of the non - thermal nucleons is introduced .",
    "we therefore discuss it separately in this study .",
    "let us now take into account all 36  events with energy information .",
    "the fit result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : allfit ] for a proton composition , where one of the parameters is fixed in each panel ( parameter space `` section '' ) .",
    "the minimal @xmath32 is about @xmath44 in the left - panels , and the @xmath45 is about two .",
    "this relatively large value comes from the above mentioned tension between muon track prediction and observation , and can in principle be avoided using a different background model .",
    "however , given the small number of bins ( eight ) , it should not be over - emphasized . comparing to fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , we note that the spectral index @xmath19 shifts to softer values ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 for 1 d.o.f . ) , see upper left panel for small @xmath22 .",
    "apart from a better matching at low energies , the information beyond @xmath48 leads to stronger constraints because no neutrinos have been seen there .",
    "however , while there is a tendency towards softer spectra @xmath49 ( for the best - fit ) in all tested cases , the exact best - fit value of @xmath19 depends on details of how the ( steep ) atmospheric backgrounds are implemented .",
    "we also have a clear limit in the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane ( upper right panel ) , where the lower right corner is excluded because it would produce too many high - e events . in that panel ,",
    "two distinctive regions appear at the @xmath40 confidence level : one can either produce the cutoff with @xmath50 , or with @xmath51 .",
    "it is noteworthy that these regions can be potentially discriminated by the flavor composition of the neutrinos : roughly on the r.h.s .",
    "of the dashed - dotted line , the neutrino production will be dominated by pion decays at the highest energies , whereas the muons lose energy faster than they decay ( `` muon damped source '' ) . as a consequence ,",
    "only muon neutrinos and antineutrinos will be produced at the source , which leads to a deviation from the canonical @xmath52 flavor composition at the detector including flavor mixing  @xcite ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "a potential theoretical constraint comes from proton synchrotron losses : not necessarily all of the regions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : allfit ] can be reached , as protons may lose energy in magnetic fields faster than they can be accelerated .",
    "this can be quantified using an acceleration rate for shock acceleration  @xcite @xmath53 which corresponds to a constant fractional energy gain per cycle @xmath54 . for efficient acceleration",
    ", one typically assumes @xmath55 .",
    "synchrotron losses are governed by @xmath56 which means that they take over at high enough energies .",
    "equating eq .",
    "( [ equ : acc ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ equ : synchr ] ) , one obtains @xmath57 where in the latter step @xmath58 was assumed , which is a good approximation for elements heavier than hydrogen . for hydrogen and @xmath59 ,",
    "the region where synchrotron losses dominate is on the r.h.s . of the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : allfit ] , upper right panel .",
    "that is , for shock acceleration and and moderately efficient acceleration , that region can not be reached .",
    "we will consider the impact of this theoretical constraint on the fit below .",
    "note that we do not assume relativistic boosting here .",
    "for example for gamma - ray bursts , @xmath60 can be reached for @xmath61 in the shock rest frame , which translates into @xmath62 in the observer s frame .",
    "note that an additional constraint comes from the size of the acceleration region ( hillas criterium ) , which is however difficult to interpret for highly relativistic sources due to relativistic length contraction and energy boosting .",
    "we do not explicitly discuss this constraint here , as it involves another parameter ( size of the acceleration region ) which can be interesting for the interpretation of the signal in terms of specific source classes , but only adds limited new information to our generic fit .",

    "is the effect of turbulence on fermi shock acceleration which may cause such effects  @xcite , another one is that the overall spectral index comes from convoluting a harder spectrum with an appropriate luminosity distribution function  @xcite .",
    "maybe even more interesting is the conceptual question if these neutrinos can come from the sources of the uhecrs .",
    "considering point  1 , which is taking into account the synchrotron loss constraint in fig .",

    "point  2 , on the other hand , can not be accommodated with the uhecr paradigm , because @xmath21 is too low .",
    "for point  3 , the discussion is much more complicated : while it can be in principle accommodated with the uhecr paradigm , the soft spectrum tends to lead to neutrino overproduction at pev energies if one normalizes the uhecr range to normalization .",
    "this is discussed for gamma - ray bursts in refs .",
    "@xcite , and , in a more generic context , in ref .",
    ". a model - independent `` proof '' seems , however , more difficult .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : allfit_th ] , we take into account multi - parameter correlations .",
    "that is , we show the projections including the minimization of the parameter not shown in each panel .",
    "this increases the fit region regions dramatically . on the other hand",
    ", we include the murase - ahlers - lacki bound , which leads to @xmath39 , and the synchrotron loss constraint , explicitly shown in the upper right panel .",
    "these theoretical constraints reduce the size of the fit regions .",
    "the main result , which can be read off from the left panels , is that spectral indices compatible with fermi acceleration are preferred in combination with a cutoff of the maximal proton energy , whereas a wide range of magnetic fields are possible .",
    "the best - fit at @xmath75 and @xmath76 points towards conventional scenarios of fermi shock acceleration together with a maximal proton energy cutoff compatible with the ankle of the cosmic ray spectrum observed in our galaxy .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the neutrinos are produced under similar conditions , such as in starburst galaxies .",
    "adding the composition to the parameters of the model increases the complexity to a level such that no meaningful information can be obtained from current data due to limited statistics .",
    "we therefore focus on the key issue , the proton composition has not been convincingly successful to describe : can the potential cutoff at pev energies be reconciled with the uhecr paradigm , taking into account that the composition could be as heavy as iron at the highest energies  @xcite ?",
    "let us assume that the magnetic fields are small enough such that magnetic field effects on the secondaries are negligible .",

    "however , the precision in icecube - hex will even allow to exploit the transition in the flavor composition expected by magnetic field effects , and discriminate between these regions .",
    "this is evident from the event rates .",
    "e.g. _  point  1 and the muon track and cascade bins between 1 and 2  pev . for current statistics ,",
    "the expectations are 0.6 tracks and 0.9 cascades for these bins , whereas for icecube - hex , the expectations are 24 muon tracks and 37 cascades .",
    "this leads to a statistical relative error of about @xmath101 the muon track to shower ratio is about 20% increased in the muon damped case ( coinciding with this energy range for the chosen test point ) compared to the pion beam case after flavor mixing , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ( lower panel , between 1  and 2  pev ) , which means that the statistics between muon tracks and showers becomes meaningful .",
    "this is a significant qualitative advance compared to the full statistics icecube-86 analysis .",
    "we have studied the interpretation of icecube data in the production scenario of nuclei - matter interactions , for which the neutrino spectrum follows the non - thermal spectrum of the nuclei .",
    "compared to earlier studies , we have taken into account possible magnetic field effects on the secondary muons and pions and the composition of the accelerated nuclei .",
    "we have especially focused on the reproduction of the spectrum , where the flavor composition ( cascades versus muon tracks ) has been implied as well . we have essentially identified four different options for the initial spectrum of the protons / nuclei to reproduce current data , which can all avoid the overproduction of events beyond a few pev :    1 .",
    "an unbroken power law with @xmath102 and magnetic fields @xmath51 in the source , leading to magnetic field effects on the secondary muons and pions .",
    "this may be realized in certain populations of gamma - ray bursts or ( extra - galactic ) micoquasars or pulsars .",
    "2 .   a power law with @xmath102 with a break or cutoff about @xmath103 to @xmath104 ( for protons ) . this option may be favorable for models of starburst galaxies , galaxy clusters / groups , or radio galaxies .",
    "an unbroken power law significantly softer than @xmath105 , where we find best - fit values for @xmath19 between @xmath106 and @xmath107 depending on analysis range and atmospheric background model .",
    "this option is the simplest possible one , also mentioned in the recent icecube three - year analysis  @xcite , where we typiclly find softer indices because of the larger analysis energy range .",
    "a major drawback has been pointed out by murase , ahlers , and lacki ( mal )  @xcite : the spectrum consequently exceeds the isotropic gamma - ray background at lower energies , unless a low - energy break is introduced .",
    "4 .   an unbroken power law with @xmath102 and a flat enough change of the composition of the non - thermal spectra in the source from lighter to heavier elements at the highest energies , which can be potentially as high as @xmath108 .",
    "while options  1 to  3 have been identified in similar forms in the literature , option  4 is entirely new .",
    "note that regarding options  1 and  2 , similar possibilities are obtained for photohadronic interactions producing neutrinos , for which the spectral shape is determined by both the nuclei and target photon spectra ; see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have been especially interested in which of the above options can be reconciled with the question that the observed neutrinos stem from the sources of the uhecrs , see also discussion in refs .",
    "option 2 ) is obviously incompatible with this assumption if the break or cutoff can be also found in the escaping proton spectrum injected into the intergalatic medium .",
    "exceptions could be scenarios with energy - dependent diffusive escape , as in that case the steady proton spectrum ( responsible for neutrino production ) can have a break , whereas the escaping proton spectrum can be different ; see _ e.g. _  ref .",
    "@xcite for hypernova remnants .",
    "option 1 ) faces the problem that synchrotron losses typically limit the maximal proton energy , and do not allow for high enough maximal energies ( unless strong lorentz boosts are involved , such as in gamma - ray bursts ) .",
    "option 3 ) , on the other hand , tends to lead to an overproduction of neutrinos at pev energies exceeding the current icecube observations when normalized to the uhecr observations , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a generic discussion  while it also violates the mal bound .",
    "we have therefore identified option 4 ) as the most promising one , especially in the light of recent auger observation pointing towards a heavier composition at the highest energies .",
    "it is generically compatible with the uhecr paradigm , as the acceleration energies can be high enough to describe observations , and it is also compatible with the mal bound . in fact , we have demonstrated that neutrino data can be used to test the acceleration mechanism in that scenario . the result from neutrino observations",
    "may , on the other hand , serve as an input for the uhecr injection at the sources in uhecr propagation models .",
    "however , the scenario is in slight tension with a very light composition at @xmath92 .",
    "finally , we have pointed out that future precision measurements will require significant volume upgrades , such as an high - energy extension of icecube or km3net in the mediterranean . while this statement is most certainly generically true , we have shown that the current icecube experiment will not be sufficient to exploit the flavor information from muon tracks versus cascades in a statistically meaningful manner to discriminate between pion beam and muon damped sources .",
    "the reason is that the flavor transition is expected at high enough energies to describe the cutoff at pev energies , where the event rates are very low .",
    "a significantly larger ( about a factor of ten ) volume upgrade would , however , allow for a discrimination between options 1 ) and 2 ) , where the flavor information will be * the * qualitatively new ingredient .",
    "it is therefore important to optimize an upgrade in a way to preserve the flavor or topology identification capability .",
