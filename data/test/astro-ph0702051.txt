    "asteroseismology is a very powerful tool .",
    "this is because we can measure the frequencies of the stellar oscillations to a very high accuracy , and the oscillations can give us information about the stars that we can not otherwise measure , helping us to constrain better the stellar parameters . in the last few years",
    "we have seen quite a breakthrough in results , which indicates the great potential of asteroseismology as a tool in relation to the search and study of exoplanets . for thorough reviews on asteroseismology",
    "in fig .  [ stellofig1 ]",
    "( left panel ) we show the luminosity of the sun observed as a star for four hours by the virgo instrument on board the soho spacecraft .",
    "the sun oscillates in many modes simultaneously , each mode with a slightly different frequency , which gives the complex sinusoidal pattern seen in fig .",

    "[ stellofig1 ] * right panel : * fourier transform of the solar time series similar to that seen in the left panel but including granulation at all time scales ( 60 days of virgo observations).[stellofig2],width=249 ]    this is clearly revealed when we take the fourier transform of the time series ( but of longer time span ) . the square root",
    "this transform , also called the amplitude spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ stellofig2 ] ( right panel ) .",
    "each peak in the amplitude spectrum represents a sinusoidal oscillation and from this we can see that the sun oscillates in many different modes , with periods of roughly five minutes .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations are a few parts per million in luminosity , which corresponds to temperature changes of less than 0.01k .",
    "the oscillations can also be observed by radial velocity measurements of the surface .",
    "the amplitude in velocity is roughly @xmath0 , corresponding to a total displacement of the solar surface by about 100 metres .",
    "what makes the sun oscillate in all these modes simultaneously is the convection near the surface .",
    "the turbulent gas motion in the convection zone ( seen as granulation on the surface ) stochastically excites oscillations , which are intrinsically damped , in this broad frequency range . the rising background noise towards lower frequencies seen in fig .  [ stellofig2 ]",
    "( right panel ) is from the random granulation cells themselves .",
    "this noise is significantly lower in velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ stellofig6 ] , bottom right ) .",
    "each frequency is coming from a mode of a standing sound wave , like in an organ pipe with nodes and anti - nodes , but in three dimensions ( see fig .",
    "[ stellofig3 ] , left panel ) .",
    "each mode has both a radial part described by the order @xmath1 , which is the number of nodes or spherical ` shells ' , and a surface pattern described by a spherical harmonic .",
    "figure  [ stellofig4 ] ( right panel ) shows examples of spherical harmonics of different degree @xmath2 and order @xmath3 .",
    "high - degree modes ( @xmath4 ) can not be detected when the sun is observed as a star due to geometric cancellation .",

    "[ stellofig3 ] * right panel : * spherical harmonics representing the surface behaviour of the oscillations ( provided by j. christensen - dalsgaard ) .",
    "[ stellofig4],width=249 ]    the frequency of each mode depends on the sound speed predominantly in that part of the sun where the particular mode spends most of its time . by observing the frequencies of many modes , the sound speed inside the sun can be reconstructed .",
    "this is extremely interesting because the sound speed depends on physical parameters like temperature , density and composition .",
    "for example , hydrogen turns into helium as the sun gets older and the sound speed and - hence the frequencies - change .",
    "therefore , we can in principle measure the age of the sun .",
    "a large number of stars are expected to show oscillations that are stochastically driven by convection as in the sun ( also known as solar - like oscillations ) .",
    "stars located on the cool side of the classical instability strip have convection near the surface , and are therefore expected to show solar - like oscillations . figure  [ stellofig5 ] ( left panel ) shows a hertzsprung - russell diagram where different regions of known stellar pulsations are indicated . in recent years",
    "solar - like oscillations have been detected in a large range of stars from dwarfs to red giants ( indicated in fig .",
    "[ stellofig5 ] , left panel ) .",
    "these results are mostly based on velocity measurements obtained from the ground @xcite .",
    "a few examples of these detections can be seen in fig .",

    "[ stellofig6],width=188 ]    from ground it is extremely difficult to measure the oscillations using photometry due to the earth s atmosphere , especially for the less evolved stars , which show the smallest amplitudes . from space , however , detection of oscillations in a true analogue of the sun is possible .",
    "the seismic signature of solar - like oscillations is a nearly regular spaced comb pattern in the amplitude spectrum .",

    "we see two characteristic frequency separations : the large separation , which is between modes of the same degree @xmath2 ( but successive radial order @xmath1 , which for the sun is in the order of 1030 ) , and the small separations .",
    "the large separation ( @xmath11 ) is a direct measure of the stellar density , while the small separation ( @xmath12 ) is sensitive to the mean molecular weight in the core ( hence age ) of the star .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "a planet transit potentially gives a very precise measure of the radius of the planet relative to its host star ( holman et al .",
    ", this proceedings ) . however , additional observations are required to establish the actual size scale .",
    "basically , we can not tell if it is a transit of a big star by big planet , or a transit of a small star by a small planet .",
    "seismology can be of significant help to constrain the actual stellar radius ( and hence the radius of the planet when combined with the transit depth ) , using only the photometric transit data .",
    "the requirements are that the precision is high enough and that the data sample the oscillations .",
    "these requirements depend very much on where in the hr diagram the star is located , as both oscillation amplitude and period vary significantly across the hr diagram .    without applying asteroseismology and without a distance measurement ,",
    "the stellar radius has to be constrained by spectroscopy and photometry .",
    "in this case we can determine the temperature to roughly 100 k ( or 2% ) , and the absolute luminosity to approximately 40% .",
    "the accuracy in the radius is therefore roughly 20% . from the stellar location in the hr diagram",
    "we can further obtain a mass estimate to about 10% using stellar models .    from seismology",
    "we get the large separation to a very high accuracy , at least 0.5% for kepler targets .",
    "since the mean density of the star is proportional to the large separation squared , this seismic measure gives the density to about 1% .",
    "combining that with the 2% temperature determination reduces the uncertainty in the mass to roughly 5% ( in addition to a smaller uncertainty in the luminosity of approximately 10% ) .",
    "this mass estimate together with the seismic density measurement finally provides a 23% radius estimate , which is a tremendous improvement . for kepler",
    ", parallax measurements are expected to be derived at the end of the mission , which will lower the uncertainty in the luminosity to about 2% from the parallaxes alone .",
    "this implies a better mass estimate to roughly 3% , and hence a radius estimate of approximately 1% if combined with the seismic measurement of the large separation .",
    "this in turn improves the precision of the temperature to less than 1% .",
    "in addition , the small separation can be measured to at least 10% , which for a solar mass star implies that the age will be known to better than 1 gyr .",
    "* including seismology to determine the stellar parameters improves significantly the accuracy with which we can characterize the stars , and hence their planets .",
    "* this can be obtained without complicated and time - consuming calculations of pulsation models for each star . *",
    "only the data already obtained to detect the transits need to be used , provided the data sampling is high enough .",
    "cadence requirements are about once per minute for a true sun - like star , and up to roughly half an hour for a giant star .",
    "* this technique would help tremendously for a mission such as kepler , where the precision in the radius estimates of the host stars are improved by a factor of 7 without any parallax information and by a factor of 20 when parallaxes become available .    in the last few years",
    ", the field of asteroseismology has taken advantage of the observational techniques developed in the quest of detecting and studying exoplanets .",
    "this has mostly been from ultra - high precision doppler measurements , but in the coming years very accurate photometry from space will become available . with these observational techniques in common , very similar data sets and complementary but supporting science goals , there is an obvious opportunity for exoplanet research to take advantage of the extremely precise measurements that seismology can offer in order to determine the properties of planet - hosting stars .",
    "this makes the future for both research fields very exciting ."
