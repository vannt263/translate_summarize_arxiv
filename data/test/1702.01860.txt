    "quantum simulation is an active area of research in which the behavior of complex quantum systems is modeled by simpler , more controllable physical systems  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the wave propagation of electrons in a solid , which determines the electrical properties of materials , can be modeled by the wave propagation of ultracold atoms sourced from a bose - einstein condensate ( bec )  @xcite .",
    "such atoms are cold enough that their thermal de broglie wavelength is larger than the wavelength of visible light , allowing optical structures to be created with similar dimension to the thermal wavelength .",
    "this allows for the dynamics of complex systems to be investigated by studying the motion of ultracold atoms in an analogous optical potential .",
    "the high degree of controllability inherent in ultracold atom systems means that the dynamical effects of additional layers of complexity can be systematically studied .",
    "these potentials to manipulate neutral atoms are commonly produced by the off - resonant ac stark shift , which is proportional to the light intensity .",
    "gradients in the light intensity hence generate a force , referred to as the ` dipole force ' .",
    "arbitrary potentials can be generated by spatial light modulators ( slms ) which manipulate the phase of the light @xcite , digital mirror devices ( dmds ) @xcite , or by ` painting ' time - averaged potentials @xcite .",
    "hence , the ` programming ' on such quantum simulators is performed through the creation of customizable optical potentials to create a hamiltonian engineered  * ? ? ?",
    "* to mimic the desired system .",
    "application of these light - shaping methods has allowed for the control of cold atoms on varying length scales . on one hand , careful preparation of single atoms on latices has been achieved  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "novel trap geometries have led to the advent of atomtronics , where atomic analogues of electronic circuits are created .",
    "geometries such as ring traps have been successful in modeling atomic squid circuits  @xcite , and further trap geometries have been proposed  @xcite and realized  @xcite for other atomtronic circuits .",
    "here we describe our system used to manipulate ultracold @xmath3rb atoms trapped in two dimensions .",
    "we implement a large area 2d trap which prevents motion in the vertical direction while allowing near - ballistic motion within the plane . at the same time we project customizable light patterns created by an slm using intensity modulation .",
    "the imaging system developed for the slm is designed to produce optical structures with a resolution of 1  @xmath1 m .",
    "the slm is imaged using 532  nm light , which produces a repulsive potential for @xmath3rb .",
    "the combination of both these elements allows us to investigate transport dynamics at large length scales in two dimensions which is a region not yet addressed by existing ultracold atom experiments .",
    "the ultimate goal of this setup is to move towards a quantum simulator for transport experiments in 2d disordered ultracold atom systems @xcite .",
    "we create customizable potentials by shaping the light field of a 532 nm laser using a holoeye lc - r 720 slm .",
    "the display is a reflective liquid crystal on silicon ( lcos )  @xcite chip with a resolution of 1280 @xmath4 768 pixels .",
    "each pixel has a pitch of 20  @xmath5 m and is addressed using an 8-bit grayscale value .",
    "we modulate the light field in intensity , which we find yields images superior to those achievable by phase modulation holography  @xcite .",
    "each pixel of the slm acts as an adjustable wave plate , which translates to an adjustable intensity through the use of a polariser .",
    "the image quality is determined by the quality of the incident beam and induced aberrations from optics .    for our experiments we desire an imaging system capable of producing optical structures of comparable size to the atomic de broglie wavelength , which is on the order of 1  @xmath1 m .",
    "this will enable a range of experiments , including exotic lattices  @xcite , and will tie in with our future aim of studying disordered systems in 2d .    to obtain the resolution required , we position a high numerical aperture ( na ) lens inside the main vacuum chamber .",
    "the location of the magneto optical trap ( mot ) beams place an upper bound on the numerical aperture of the imaging lens .",
    "we use an aspheric lens with a na of 0.42 ( edmund optics part number 67 - 278 ) as the final imaging lens inside the chamber .",
    "we designed a lens mount to hold the asphere in place inside the vacuum chamber , primarily under gravity , with minimal surface contact .",
    "the lens mount is connected to a custom vacuum flange which in turn is attached to edge welded bellows , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : bellows ] .",
    "extending and contracting the bellows controls the vertical position and tilt of the lens inside the vacuum chamber providing a 20  mm travel length to position the final image in focus with the cold atom cloud .",
    "we directly image the face of the slm with the lens configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : optical_setup ] .",
    "the slm is illuminated with up to 5  w of 532  nm light , sourced from a spectral - physics millenia laser , that passes through a polarizing beam splitter after being expanded to a diameter of 32  mm , illuminating the whole slm screen .",
    "light that is then shifted in polarization , depending on the pixel configuration of the slm , is imaged by a matched achromat set creating an intermediate image with a magnification of 0.15@xmath2 .",
    "the light is then imaged onto the plane of the atoms using a 250  mm achromat lens and the 0.42  na asphere , providing a total magnification of 0.036@xmath2 . with this magnification",
    ", we obtain a maximum potential depth for @xmath3rb of 2.5  @xmath1k .",
    "the resolution of the slm imaging system is measured outside of the vacuum system prior to installation .",
    "a vacuum chamber window was also present in the test setup to mimic the working conditions of the system as close as possible .",
    "we use two small 3  @xmath2  3  pixel squares separated by a set gap ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolution ] ) .",
    "the gap can be resolved for a 2  pixel gap size placing a lower bound on our resolution of 1  @xmath1 m , which is the target resolution for our experiments .",
    "the 2d trap is created by two highly elliptical beams with a wavelength of 1064  nm and an aspect ratio of 16:3 incident at relative angle of 6@xmath6 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : optical_setup ] .",
    "the 1064  nm light is sourced from a nufern 15  w fiber amplifier ( nua-1064-pb-0015-c0 ) , seeded by a eagleyard 1064  nm diode laser ( eyp - rws-1064 - 00080 - 1500-sot02 - 0000).the resulting interference pattern creates sheets of light with a spacing of 8  @xmath5 m . each of these light sheets provide weak trapping in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 dimensions with trap frequencies of 1  hz . at the same time the trap provides a strong confinement in the vertical @xmath9 dimension with a frequency of 810 @xmath10 15  hz .",
    "the interference fringes are stable over long periods of time , fig .",
    "[ fig : fringe_stability ] shows the fringe shift to be less than 15@xmath6 over 1  hour , with minimal parametric heating losses .",
    "each fringe has a large spatial extent with a rayleigh range of 1.6  mm .",
    "the main fringe has a trap depth of 2  @xmath1k  @xmath2  @xmath11 .",
    "this spatial range enables our experiment to observe transport effects in disordered systems that are characterized by spatial lengths on the order of 200  @xmath5 m or larger .",
    "the ratio @xmath12 shows that vertical excitations are minimal and atoms trapped in the plane are in a 2d regime .",
    "the 2d degenerate gas of ultracold atoms is generated by loading an initial bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) into the 2d trap .",
    "our vacuum chamber setup and bec generation is described in earlier work  @xcite , with the addition of a 2d mot . in brief , a 2d mot loads the 3d mot located inside the main ultra - high vacuum chamber .",
    "an all - optical @xmath3rb bec is produced by evaporatively cooling atoms , optically pumped to the @xmath13 state , loaded into a crossed - beam co@xmath14 dipole trap .",
    "loading of the 2d planar trap begins following the production of the bec .",
    "the ramp sequence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beams_and_ramp ] . in the first section of the ramp",
    "the 1064  nm beams are linearly ramped up to full power in 1000  ms , while the co@xmath14 beams are simultaneously ramped down to 20% of the power at bose - einstein condensation .",
    "all laser powers are maintained at this power for 100 ms to equilibrate the system , with the co@xmath14 beams providing weak radial confinement and the 1064 nm beams providing suspension against gravity .",
    "the co@xmath14 beams are subsequently ramped down to zero in 20  ms , which releases the atoms into the 2d trap . using this loading scheme",
    "we obtain a loading efficiency of @xmath15 into the 2d trap .",
    "we now characterise the behavior of the 2d degenerate gas of ultracold atoms inside the 2d trap .",
    "after the atoms are loaded into the 2d trap they are left to expand .",
    "[ fig : atom_expansion](a  c ) shows the atoms expanding inside the 2d trap for different expansion times .",
    "we measure the atomic radius at different expansion times and observe a linear increase of the radius over a time period greater than 100  ms , with the plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atom_expansion](d ) .",
    "the linear growth of the atomic radius indicates ballistic expansion . by applying a linear fit to the data we obtain a temperature of 8 nk for the atoms corresponding to a de broglie wavelength of 2  @xmath5 m .",
    "we measure a trap lifetime of 2  s. it should be stressed that any heating due to vibrations or otherwise will cause the atoms to escape from the trap , which has a shallow trap - depth under gravity of 2  @xmath1k .",
    "during the co@xmath14 laser ramp - down , the 532  nm light is ramped to full power simultaneously .",
    "the 532  nm light projects the desired potential onto the atoms . in this section",
    "we show some example experiments which reflect the control over atoms which the setup provides . in these experiments ,",
    "the atoms begin from a point source at the location of the co@xmath14 beam intersection .",
    "a visualization of the location of all 3 beams and intensity ramps is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beams_and_ramp ] . with blue - detuned light",
    ", a clear method is to image the outline of a certain shape and allow the atoms to expand to fill the void .",
    "this is different from other experiments where the atoms are evaporated in the presence of the potential taking on the shape of the projected image  @xcite . as such , our experiments are transmissive and require a defined path for the atoms to expand into .",

    "( b ) beam intensity ramps for all 3 beams during the loading process and application of the tailored potential .",
    "a relative laser power of 1 corresponds to an output of 50  mw for the co@xmath14 laser , 8  w for the 1064  nm laser and 3  w for the 532  nm laser.,width=250 ]    figure  [ fig : kiwi ] shows an image of atoms where the outline of a kiwi bird has been imaged onto the plane .",
    "the general outline is well resolved , while the ` beak ' and ` feet ' are partially resolved due to the small size in channel width of approximately 5  @xmath1 m , limiting the flow of atoms into these structures .",
    "we can also look at more functional geometries to analyze atomic transport dynamics .",
    "a ` dumbbell ' structure , where an initial circular reservoir loaded with the atoms is connected by a channel to a secondary reservoir , allows for a controlled study of transmissive experiments for where the chemical potential drives the atoms from one reservoir to the other .",
    "figure [ fig : dumbell ] shows the expansion of the atoms into a such a potential with a 35 @xmath5 m long channel after 150 ms of expansion time .",
    "we define the number imbalance as    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the atom number in the initial reservoir and @xmath18 of the final reservoir .",
    "dumbbell structures create a double - well structure which can be used to model a range of systems .",
    "for example , dumbbell geometries have been used to model a resistor - capacitor - inductor ( rcl ) atomtronic circuit  @xcite .",
    "we create the dumbbell using the slm , allowing the channel width and length to be tailored to investigate the atom transport .",
    "the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : dumbell](d ) shows the atom number imbalance against time .",
    "two transport regimes are observed .",
    "the first 40  ms are dominated by ballistic transport , resulting in a rapid linear decrease of the imbalance .",
    "once a sufficient number of atoms have entered the second reservoir the effects of the chemical potentials dominate the transport .",
    "we observe an exponential decay coupled with oscillatory behaviour . in this regime",
    "the system is best modelled by the above rcl atomtronic circuit .",
    "this model predicts oscillatory behaviour and energy exchange between the chemical potential of the reservoirs and the kinetic energy of the atoms , at a frequency determined by @xmath19 .    in future experiments , adding disorder to the channel opens up the possibility of studying localization effects .",
    "the long spatial range of our experiment will also allow us to study length scales comparable to that of localization lengths for cold atom systems .",
    "other geometries can be used , such as ring traps , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rings ] . here",
    "atoms are initially loaded onto the left - side of a 70  @xmath1 m outer diameter ring and allowed to expand .",
    "ring traps have proven to be a test bed for numerous quantum effects @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is the possibility to use rings as atomtronic systems by analyzing the atom number imbalances in the left and right side of the ring  @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have presented an ultracold atom setup capable of conducting transport experiments over large length ranges in 2d .",
    "customizable repulsive potentials are generated by a slm using intensity modulation to shape the light field of a 532  nm laser .",
    "an imaging system , with a lens inside the ultra high vacuum chamber , is used to generate optical potentials with a lower - bound resolution of 1  @xmath1 m . our initial results with a variety of geometries demonstrate the versatility of our setup .",
    "our system provides a test bed for experiments on quantum transport and localization .",
    "furthermore , results leading into atomtronics have also been observed .",
