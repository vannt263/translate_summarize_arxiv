    "ngc4388 is an almost edge - on sa(s)b galaxy ( inclination 79 ) in the virgo cluster ( at about @xmath2 distance ) , located about @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) west from the center of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) of ngc4388 has undergone a stripping event by ram pressure , evident from the rapid decline of star formation @xmath5 ago @xcite . like many other galaxies in cluster environments ,",
    "ngc4388 is a @xmath6-deficient galaxy that lost about 85% of its @xmath6 mass @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 disk is strongly truncated within the optical disk .",
    "an @xmath6 plume extends up to 100kpc out from the galaxy plane @xcite .",
    "the gas stripping is possibly the result of the interaction between the galaxy and the icm .",
    "@xcite estimated that the galaxy passed close to the cluster center about @xmath7 ago . a more recent model yields a timescale of about @xmath8 ( vollmer , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "early vla studies of this galaxy revealed a bright double source in the nucleus and an outflow lobe that opens up like an hourglass and extends to about 1.5kpc from the center @xcite .",
    "observations with very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) revealed a radio jet with @xmath9pc extent @xcite .",
    "a circumnuclear disk of @xmath10pc radius , oriented edge - on and almost parallel to the galaxy plane , was detected by its water maser emission @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the jet and the outflow emerge almost perpendicular to the galaxy plane .",
    "previous vla and effelsberg radio continuum observations showed an extended halo and extended features out of the disk @xcite .",
    "these features may be related to the outflow event seen in @xmath0 and @xmath11 observations @xcite .",
    "these deep optical spectroscopic observations are crucial to understanding the complexity and the dynamics of the outflow of ionized gas from this galaxy .",
    "@xcite concluded that the extended emission - line region is gas stripped by the action of ram pressure and photo - ionized by the radiation from the agn .",
    "high resolution x - ray observations with _ chandra x - ray observatory _ show emission from the outflow as well as from the radio jet @xcite . on the other hand , lower resolution x - ray observations with xmm - newton",

    "this halo might be shaped by the mach cone created by the supersonic speed of the galaxy in that medium @xcite .",
    "the clear correlation between features in optical , radio and x - ray frequencies suggests a common origin .",
    ".ngc4388 properties [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ b_all_parts_table ]",
    "we clearly detect the northern outflow extending from the center of ngc4388 in total intensity ( fig .  [ totali_pa ] ) , while the southern counterpart is weaker . due to the inclination of the galaxy , the emission from the northern outflow travels through the disk on the way to the observer , contrary to the emission of the southern counterpart .",
    "it is common in agn observations to see one side of the jet brighter than the other due to doppler beaming @xcite .",
    "the blue - shifted velocities of the @xmath0 outflow in the north indicate that the northern outflow is pointing toward the observer . in those cases ,",
    "the jet has an inclination toward the observer and it travels at relativistic speed .",
    "this high speed would imply a difference in size between northern and southern polarization filaments due to relativistic effects .",
    "however , the agn jet can not remain relativistic until kilo - parsec scales . a possible explanation for this configuration would imply an internal asymmetry in the ism density close to the agn core .",
    "this situation is supported by @xmath11 observations @xcite where there is a region of diffuse emission toward the south of the nucleus , possibly due to an interaction between the agn outflow and the ism gas .    in the northeastern part of the halo we can identify total power emission associated with the outflows in @xmath0 and @xmath11 @xcite and x - rays @xcite .",
    "the northern outflow shows strongly polarized emission at the top with degrees of polarization of @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ degree_pol ] ) , while the central part of the same structure , i.e. , the nuclear region of the galaxy , reveals no detectable polarization ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "as the outflow is oriented almost perpendicular to the galaxy disk , faraday depolarization could occur in the northern ( nearby ) part of the disk that is located between the outflow and the observer .",
    "strong depolarization ( @xmath14 ) at 6ghz by external faraday dispersion requires a dispersion in rotation measure of @xmath15 , e.g. by a diffuse ionized medium with an average thermal electron density of @xmath16 , assuming a turbulent field strength in the disk of @xmath17 ( table  [ b_all_parts_table ] ) , a pathlength through the disk of about 5000pc , 100pc turbulence length and a volume filling factor of 0.5 .",
    "such electron densities are typical for the ism of spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . alternatively , depolarization could occur by internal faraday dispersion in the outflow itself . for a turbulent field strength of @xmath18 and a pathlength of 1000pc ,",
    "an average internal thermal electron density of @xmath19 is needed , which is a reasonable value .",
    "thanks to the new polarized emission maps , we are able to identify for the first time the counter - outflow toward the south . the main indication is the change of the orientation of the magnetic vectors from parallel to the spiral arms of the disk to being oriented along the nuclear outflow in the southern part that is connected to the center of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ totali_pa ] ) .",
    "this is a clear indication of a different structure in front of the southern arm .",
    "the degree of polarization in the southern outflow is @xmath20 , similar to the outer part of the northern outflow .",
    "contrary to the central northern outflow , the southern outflow does show polarization , probably because the southern spiral arm does not obstruct the view of the southern outflow by the observer .",
    "the particular configuration of filaments and blobs seen in polarized radio continuum and @xmath0 emission of ngc4388 might suggest that these are different parts of the same event . both filaments and blobs seem to form an hourglass - shaped structure .",
    "this kind of structure is typically seen in starburst galaxies .",
    "the prototypical starburst galaxy m82 shows such an hourglass shape in @xmath0 emission .",
    "in such a case , strong star formation in the galactic center and subsequent supernova explosions eject gas into the galactic halo within a biconical structure @xcite",
    ". hot tenuous gas expands as a superbubble into the halo pushing the extraplanar disk to larger galactic radii and compressing it .",
    "the compressed gas cools radiatively and becomes visible in many frequency ranges , leading to the observed hourglass shape . due to gas compression the magnetic field",
    "is enhanced and aligned , giving rise to a large scale ordered magnetic field observed as polarized radio continuum emission ( e.g. ngc5775 @xcite ) . within this picture",
    "the compressed shells should also be visible in x - rays ( m82 @xcite , ngc253 @xcite , ngc5775 @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the diffuse x - ray emission of m82 @xcite show that the superbubble in this galaxy is partly filled with hot ( @xmath21 ) gas .",
    "the radio continuum emission of m82 @xcite is co - spatial with the @xmath0 and the x - ray emission . in ngc5775",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission @xcite fills the radio continuum superbubble on the southwestern quadrant of the disk @xcite . the observed correlation between x - rays , @xmath0 , and radio continuum indicates that the hot x - ray plasma is closely linked to cooler and denser gas detected in @xmath0 and to cres .",
    "such filaments extend into the galactic halo up to @xmath22 in the case of ngc253 @xcite .",
    "in ngc4388 the situation is different .",
    "the x - ray emission ( see right panel of fig . [ halpha_x - ray ] ) is not symmetric as expected from superwind models .",
    "compared to the x - ray emission of ngc253 we do not see enhanced extraplanar x - ray emission south of the galactic disk , in the area where the base of the bubble should be found . north of the galactic disk",
    "there is extraplanar x - ray emission .",
    "however , it is very asymmetric with almost all x - ray emission coming from the northeastern side of the galactic disk .",
    "in addition , the polarized radio continuum emission shows a filamentary structure as expected by a galactic outflow @xcite only in the northeastern and the southwestern quadrants .",
    "moreover , the observed se and nw blobs are elongated parallel to the disk .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the observed spatial distribution of polarized radio continuum , @xmath0 and x - ray emission is not consistent with a symmetric superwind scenario . in sect .",
    "[ blobs ] we show that ngc4388 hosts a less prominent galactic wind probably originating from the spiral arms .",
    "we detect faint polarized emission filamentary in structure extending beyond the end of both sides of the outflow .",
    "there are striking similarities in morphology between these features and the @xmath0 outflow ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ halpha_x - ray ] ) .",
    "the polarized radio continuum filaments are offset from the @xmath0 plumes toward the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "the projected lengths of these filamentary structures are about 50  @xmath23 and 20  @xmath24 for the northern and southern parts , respectively . in both cases",
    "the deconvolved half power width is about 3.9(0.3kpc ) .",
    "the symmetry of the two filaments with respect to the galaxy center suggests a collimated outflow perhaps driven by a radio jet .",
    "the position angle of the filament is about @xmath25 , i.e. it is not perpendicular to the disk plane .",
    "the magnetic field vectors show an ordered field along both filaments ( see fig .",
    "[ pi_pa ] ) .",
    "none of these external features are seen in total intensity due to the lower noise in the polarization maps .",
    "the magnetic field vectors in the southern part connect the nucleus with the southern polarization filament through an apparently wiggling structure .",
    "this change of direction could be due to precession event of the agn jet . in that case",
    ", the polarization filaments we see at kiloparsec scales are the continuation of a structure that originates in the nucleus .",
    "the fact that there is a drastic drop in polarized intensity between the nuclear outflows and the filaments could be the result of an abrupt change in the direction of the outflow giving rise to this change in polarized intensity .",
    "in that case , what we see are different parts of the same event .",
    "the origin of the filaments of ngc4388 will be discussed in more detail in a future paper .",
    "we observe two blobs of polarized emission far out in the galactic halo ( about @xmath26 from the disk plane ) , in the northwestern and southeastern regions above and below the disk , with magnetic field vectors forming an almost vertical field structure ( fig .",
    "[ totali_pa ] and [ pi_pa ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field vectors within the disk and in the halo are perpendicular to each other , so that there are two areas between the blobs and the disk of low polarization due to geometrical depolarization within the beam .",
    "the vertical field in the blobs can be part of a large - scale halo field or field loops stretched by a strong galactic wind ( see sect .",
    "[ ram pressure ] ) .",
    "these polarized blobs remain undetected at other frequencies , e.g. , optical , @xmath0 , or x - rays . however , some of the channel maps of the @xmath6 cubes from @xcite show structures that extend from the outskirts of the western part of the @xmath6 disk in the northeastern direction , coincident with the nw blob , indicating a possible relation to the blobs detected in polarization .",
    "we interpret this as a galactic outflow from the spiral arms .",
    "the fact that the polarized blobs are detected close to both spiral arms in projection ( @xmath27 ) may indicate that they are related to the disk .",
    "furthermore , there is x - ray ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ halpha_x - ray ] ) , polarized and total power emission extending @xmath28 south of the southeastern spiral arm and north of the northwestern spiral arm .",
    "if so , possibly the cres are transported by the galactic wind from the spiral arm . in this case , we estimate the speed of the galactic wind using cres synchrotron lifetime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the total magnetic field ( table  [ b_all_parts_table ] ) with an estimated error of about @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the central observation frequency .",
    "the distance between the spiral arm and the outer edge of the blobs ( at the level of @xmath33 ) is about @xmath34 for the nw blob and about @xmath35 for the se blob . to reach this height ,",
    "cres have to travel with an average velocity of @xmath36 , which is typical for the speed of galactic winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the true speed in the blob depends on the velocity profile of the outflow and could be several times larger , at least by a factor of two for constant acceleration .",
    "the velocity of about @xmath37 refers to the component of the galactic wind in the sky plane . with a disk inclination of @xmath38 and assuming an outflow velocity vertical to the disk plane , we can estimate the component parallel to the line of sight of that vector and compare it to the observed radial velocities in @xmath0 .",
    "we estimate the radial velocity of the outflow to be @xmath39 , which is close to the value observed in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "although there is no stringent reason for the same velocity of the hot ( or cres ) and the @xmath0-emitting cool gas flows , it is remarkable that these two components have similar velocities .    the magnetic field computed by the equipartition formula ( @xmath40 ) could be underestimated .",
    "the energy spectrum of cres propagating into the halo is steepened by energy losses and hence is not proportional to the proton spectrum , i.e. the proton - to - electron ratio k is significantly larger than 100 as assumed in sect .  [ equi ] ( see discussion in @xcite ) . in this case",
    "we would get a shorter synchrotron lifetime and therefore a larger velocity of the outflow .",
    "a better estimate of the outflow speed needs knowledge of the synchrotron spectral index as a function of height above the plane , which can not be obtained with the present data .",
    "it is surprising that there is no counterpart of both blobs on the opposite sides of the disk in any other wavelength .",
    "the two blobs might be due to an earlier agn - related outflow , because agns can turn off and on as well as change direction",
    ". however , the age of a previous outflow would be much beyond the synchrotron lifetime ( see above ) . in the case of a continuous galactic wind expanding from the disk",
    ", one would expect that the outflow of particles and magnetic field is equally strong on both sides of the spiral arm .",
    "the asymmetric distribution suggests that the outflow is not homogeneous , but emerges from individual star - forming complexes that are located not exactly in the disk plane .",
    "the non - detection of the ne counterpart on the other hand , could be caused by intrinsic depolarization due to the overlapping with the material coming from the nuclear outflow in that area .",
    "we conclude that ngc4388 hosts a collimated nuclear outflow and a galactic wind originating mainly from the spiral arms .",
    "the halo pressure can have several components : thermal gas pressure , magnetic pressure , cosmic ray pressure , and ram pressure from the galactic outflow .",
    "the thermal pressure of the hot gas of @xmath41 is estimated using a temperature of @xmath42 and a density of @xmath43 from @xcite , table 3 , interpolated between disk and tail , assuming a volume filling factor of 0.5 . with an expansion velocity of @xmath44 ,",
    "the ram pressure of the galactic wind is @xmath45 . with an equipartition magnetic field strength of @xmath46",
    "the magnetic pressure is @xmath47 .",
    "thus , there is approximate equipartition between the different pressure components ( except for the cosmic ray pressure that is one third of the magnetic pressure in case of energy equipartition ) .",
    "if the pressure components can be simply added , the total pressure is about @xmath48 .",
    "if , however , the pressure components are not co - spatial or some of the pressure fluctuations are anticorrelated , they should not be added to a total pressure value .",
    "hence , the pressure in the halo is in the range of @xmath49 .",
    "the equipartition between the ram pressure of the outflow and the thermal pressure can be understood by the interplay between shocks and the ambient halo gas , which keeps the outflow velocity close to the sound speed of the hot halo gas .",
    "a large - scale magnetic field may exist in the entire halo of ngc4388 ( a magnetosphere ) , but is observable only in regions into which a sufficiently large number of cres is supplied from the disk by an outflow .",
    "evidence for a large - scale regular field in the halo has to come from measurements of faraday depth at lower frequencies with good resolution in faraday space , i.e. a wide coverage in @xmath50 space , which is not the case for the present observations centered at @xmath51 .",
    "polarization observations in l band ( centered at 1.5ghz ) are strongly affected by faraday depolarization , hence vla s band ( centered at 3ghz ) seems more promising .",
    "a lack of faraday rotation around @xmath52 would support the idea of stretched field loops .      in the first part of this subsection the icm ram pressure is estimated via the hi stripping radius , the thermal pressure of the resisting ism and via a detailed comparison between observations and dynamical simulations .",
    "magnetic pressure may help to resist icm ram pressure .",
    "its importance is investigated in the second part of this subsection . as a consistency check ,",
    "the lower limit of the icm ram pressure can be estimated via ionized high - velocity filaments that are accelerated by ram pressure .",
    "all ram pressure estimates yield values in excess of the pressure in the galactic halo .",
    "we suggest that the observed icm clumpiness can account for this discrepancy , i.e. the galaxy is moving a portion of the clumpy icm where the local density is several times lower than value predicted by a continuous smooth icm distribution .",
    "ngc4388 is moving to the southwest .",
    "therefore , we expect ram pressure compression in the southern part of the galactic disk .",
    "@xcite described a scenario where the peak of ram pressure for this galaxy has already passed but in which the galaxy is still being affected in a considerable way by the icm .",
    "the peak of the ram pressure in ngc4388 occurred @xmath53 ago @xcite having @xmath54 @xcite . at this time",
    "step the absolute velocity with respect to the cluster core is estimated to be @xmath55 and the maximum icm density @xmath56 ( @xcite erroneously gave a maximum pressure three times higher than the actual value ) .",
    "the model predicts that the galaxy is now affected by a ram pressure of @xmath57 of the peak ram pressure occurred in the past .",
    "this means that at the present day this value would be @xmath58 .",
    "@xcite performed high - resolution 3d hydrodynamical simulations , using different parameters of densities and velocities , to reproduce the stripped gas as result of the interaction between a massive galaxy and the icm . in this study , the authors were also able to reproduce outflows of about 100kpc extension . from all the scenarios considered , they concluded that the most similar one to the case of ngc4388 can be described by a ram pressure of a few @xmath59 .",
    "however , improved hydrodynamical models by @xcite could not explain the shape of the gas tails of ngc4388 , possibly because the icm is inhomogeneous or the outflow influences the interaction between the galaxy and the icm .",
    "all these ram pressure estimates are based on the assumption that the spatial distribution of the icm is continuous and smooth .    as a consistency check",
    "we apply the method of @xcite to calculate the icm density .",
    "the ratio between the thermal pressure at the stagnation point @xmath60 and the thermal pressure of the freely streaming icm @xmath61 is a function of the galaxy s mach number @xmath62 : @xmath63^{-1/(\\gamma - 1 ) } , \\label{vikhilin}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the adiabatic index of the monoatomic gas . with an icm temperature of @xmath65 @xcite",
    "the icm sound speed is approximately @xmath66 .",
    "we assume a galaxy velocity within the virgo cluster of @xmath67 .",
    "the mach number thus is @xmath68 , leading to a pressure ratio of @xmath69 . assuming equilibrium between the thermal pressure of the hot gas halo of the galaxy and the icm gas at the stagnation point",
    ", we can replace @xmath60 by the halo pressure . with the thermal pressure of the halo @xmath70 from sect .",
    "[ halo_pressure ] , we obtain an icm thermal pressure of @xmath71 and an icm density of @xmath72 .",
    "this agrees with the density derived from x - rays @xcite and from the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) signal measured by _",
    "@xcite , while the dynamical model yields an icm density of @xmath73 .",
    "the model density thus seems to be overestimated by a factor of about @xmath74 .",
    "however , magnetic fields are not taken into account in the icm pressure estimate of eq .",
    "[ vikhilin ] .",
    "including magnetic fields will increase the estimated icm ram pressure and thus the estimated icm density . in sect .",
    "[ icm clumpiness ] we show that icm clumping might also mitigate the discrepancy between the two icm pressure estimates .",
    "radio continuum observations of other virgo galaxies affected by ram pressure like ngc4402 or ngc4501 also show signs of interaction with the icm : both galaxies show a truncated gas disk @xcite with enhancements of polarization and sharp edges of the total power emission on one side of the galactic disk @xcite . @xcite",
    "estimated a ram pressure of @xmath75 for ngc4501 .",
    "for ngc4402 we can estimate an upper limit of ram pressure by assuming that the western @xmath6 tail is pushed to higher galactic latitudes . according to @xcite the gravitational restoring force balances ram pressure :",
    "@xmath76 . with a rotation velocity of @xmath77 , a gas surface density of @xmath78 , and an @xmath6 radius of @xmath79 the ram pressure of ngc4402",
    "is @xmath80 .",
    "if the @xmath6 tail is ram pressure stripped gas that now falls back to the galactic disk the actual ram pressure would be a factor of few lower than our estimate .",
    "the estimated ram pressure of ngc4388 is somewhat smaller than that of ngc4402 and similar to that of ngc4501 .",
    "since these galaxies show sharp edges of the radio continuum distribution and polarized ridges on one side of the galactic disk , we would expect to see the same phenomenon in ngc4388 .",
    "in contrast to ngc4402 or ngc4501 , the radio halo of ngc4388 does not show a sharp southern edge .",
    "in addition , the polarized southwestern blob clearly belongs to the radio halo and thus implies that it is not compressed by ram pressure .",
    "the southern filament with a stronger magnetic field seems also unaffected by ram pressure . as observed in ngc4569 @xcite the pressure of a galactic wind superbubble of ngc4388 ( sect .",
    "[ halo_pressure ] ) may resist ram pressure .",
    "the magnetic pressure of a strong magnetic field may prevent ram pressure from removing the magnetic features seen in the halo .",
    "for that reason we estimate the magnetic field needed to balance the model ram pressure of @xmath81 . setting this ram pressure equal to the magnetic energy density",
    ", a total magnetic field of about @xmath82 is obtained .",
    "the value obtained from our observations in the southern blob is @xmath83 ( table  [ b_all_parts_table ] ) , smaller than what is needed to balance ram pressure , so that we would not expect any extensions of the magnetic field toward the southern halo .",
    "we also consider the possibility that energy equipartition between total cosmic rays and total magnetic fields is not valid in the halo , e.g. because the magnetic field in the expanding wind flow is highly ordered .",
    "a close coupling of the cosmic rays to the field needs scattering at field irregularities , which may be less efficient in the halo . as a result",
    ", the cosmic rays may stream with respect to the field with a velocity higher than the alfvn speed .    a field strength resisting",
    "the ram pressure of the model by @xcite would mean that the magnetic energy density has to be larger than the equipartition value by at least a factor of @xmath84 . to provide the same synchrotron intensity as in the equipartition case",
    ", the energy density of the total cosmic rays has to be lower by a factor of @xmath85 ( for a synchrotron spectral index @xmath86 ) .",
    "the corresponding ratio between the magnetic and cosmic - ray energy densities is @xmath87 , which is an extreme deviation from equipartition , causing dynamical effects that lead to recovery of equilibrium .",
    "another argument against a super - equipartition field of @xmath88 field in the halo comes from the synchrotron lifetime of cres that would decrease to about @xmath89 .",
    "an unrealistically high average outflow speed of @xmath90 would be needed to reach the height of the blobs above the disk plane .",
    "we conclude that the estimates of the field strengths in table  [ b_all_parts_table ] are realistic .",
    "either the ram pressure can not be balanced by the magnetic pressure alone or the modeled ram pressure is overestimated .      in the following , we will estimate a lower limit for the ram pressure needed to accelerate clumps of ionized gas observed by @xcite .",
    "the `` west high velocity filaments '' contain several subclumps which are located east of the galactic disk outside the faint @xmath0 halo .",
    "the radial velocities of the clumps in the filaments are between @xmath91 and @xmath92 with respect to the systemic velocity of ngc4388 .",
    "the radial components of the rotation velocity in these regions have positive values .",
    "since the galaxy is leaving the cluster , the ionized clumps are decelerated by ram pressure of the icm to negative velocities .",
    "the acceleration of a gas clump is given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the column density of the clump .",
    "the acceleration is approximately @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the distance over which the clump is accelerated .",
    "we assume @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "for the column density we take the mean gas density ] of @xmath99 and a size of @xmath100 given by @xcite . in this way we estimate the minimum ram pressure to accelerate the ionized clouds to the observed velocities to be @xmath101 , a factor of @xmath102 lower than the individual halo pressure terms estimated in sect .",
    "[ halo_pressure ] .",
    "this lower limit is consistent with ram pressure being equal or somewhat lower to the halo pressure due to the galactic wind .      from the previous sections , there are indications that the icm ram pressure from the numerical models ( @xcite , @xcite ) may be overestimated by a factor of several at this cluster radius .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy of the virgo cluster @xcite indicates a drastic drop of temperature and metallicity beyond a radius of @xmath103 from the cluster center . a natural explanation for this decrease is clumping of the icm that sets in at that radius .",

    "furthermore , two horizontally extended blobs of polarized emission are observed in the halo , about @xmath26 above and below the northeastern and southwestern spiral arms , respectively . within these blobs , the ordered magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to the galactic disk .",
    "the comparison between multi - wavelength observations of prototype galactic winds shows that ngc4388 does not host a symmetric central galactic wind .",
    "however , we suggest that , together with @xmath0 , x - ray , and total power emission being located closer to the spiral arms within the halo , the blobs of polarized emission trace a galactic wind , which most likely originate from separate sources in the spiral arms . in such a scenario the cres travel from the spiral arms into the halo , reaching distances of up to @xmath113 in the plane of the sky . assuming equipartition between cr particles and the magnetic field we estimate a total magnetic field strength for the different parts of the galaxy taking into account individual spectral indices and pathlengths . in particular , our estimate of the total magnetic field strength for the polarization blobs is @xmath114 . with this magnetic field strength ,",
    "the synchrotron lifetime of electrons in the polarized blob is @xmath115 . for traveling a distance of @xmath113 ,",
    "the average outflow velocity of those particles is @xmath44 , which agrees with the typical speed of a galactic wind expanding from the spiral arms into the halo .",
    "another edge - on virgo galaxy , ngc4402 , shows a sharp edge in the radio continuum emission which is interpreted as a compressed galactic halo .",
    "the observed symmetry of the polarized halo features in ngc4388 excludes a compression of the halo gas by icm ram pressure .",
    "we estimate the halo magnetic pressure and the ram pressure of the galactic wind to be @xmath116 .",
    "this pressure is comparable to the thermal pressure derived from x - ray observations .",
    "the estimate of the icm ram pressure based on the galaxy velocity from dynamical models and a radially averaged icm density profile from x - ray observations yields @xmath117 , in agreement with our estimate of the thermal halo pressure . if magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the halo , the halo pressure estimate increases .    allowing for icm clumping",
    ", the actual ram pressure acting on ngc4388 might be up to few times higher than what is expected based on a given galaxy velocity and an icm density determined from x - ray and sz observations .",
    "ngc4388 besides ngc4569 @xcite is the second galaxy in the virgo cluster which shows a galactic outflow resisting icm ram pressure .",
    "the detection of a radio halo around other cluster spiral galaxies could be used for an estimate of icm density and ram pressure within a factor of a few .",
    "further observations at lower frequencies ( gmrt , lofar , ska ) will reveal stronger total intensity emission from the halo of this galaxy allowing us to do a spectral index analysis and therefore better constrain the aging of the cres .",
    "measurements of the large - scale structure of the halo magnetic field in ngc4388 with help of polarization data are needed , e.g. with the vla s band where good resolution in faraday space can be reached .",
    "@xmath0 observations are also crucial to constrain the velocities within the polarized blobs . we expect to see blue - shifted emission in the wind of the southern part and red - shifted in the northern part due to the inclination of the galaxy towards the observer .",
