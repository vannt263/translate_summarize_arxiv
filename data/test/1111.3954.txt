    "a wide variety of observations point to the existence of dark matter .",
    "several different candidate particles have been proposed with masses varying from @xmath1ev for axions to @xmath2gev wimpzillas , as well as much more massive composite objects .",
    "maybe the best - motivated candidate is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) with a mass @xmath3 .",
    "one reason is that the so - called hierarchy problem of the standard model suggests the existence of an additional particle with a mass around the weak scale .",
    "such a weak scale particle , if produced thermally , would have an abundance today , similar to the measured dark matter density @xcite .",
    "the relic abundance after statistical freeze - out depends on the particle mass , the freeze - out temperature , and the annihilation cross section .",
    "the freeze - out temperature is related to the particle mass , @xmath4 .",
    "below this temperature , wimp production ceases and the wimps react only kinetically with the remaining standard - model particles .",
    "the kinetic freeze - out is delayed and happens at a temperature of a few mev @xcite .",
    "assuming that all dark matter is made of wimps , without asymmetry between wimps and anti - wimps , and that there are no complications such as co - annihilation , one can use the wmap 7 yr constraint on the relative relic abundance @xcite @xmath5 to fix the annihilation cross - section as a function of wimp mass @xmath6 .",
    "several observations of candidate dark - matter annihilation products , like @xmath7 , ( anti-)protons , ( anti-)deuterons , ( anti-)neutrinos and photons constrain the dark matter cross - sections .",
    "for a recent overview see for example @xcite .",
    "the standard calculations , as described above , assume no asymmetry between neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .    in this paper , we investigate how a neutrino asymmetry affects the wimp abundance .",
    "dropping the assumption of equal numbers of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos leads to additional contribution to the total energy density in the early universe and thus potentially alters the wimp relic abundance .",
    "this slight modification of the standard model , which might emerge from a fundamental model of neutrino masses and interactions , is well within observational limits and might play a crucial role in determining the relation between the relic abundance of a wimp and its annihilation cross - section .",
    "very little is known about neutrino ( flavour ) asymmetries , due to the lack of any direct observation of cosmological neutrinos and the large number of different theories of lepto- and baryogenesis .",
    "thus , the cosmic background of neutrinos may hide a large neutrino - anti - neutrino asymmetry , orders of magnitude larger than the baryon asymmetry @xcite , @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the number densities of baryons and anti - baryons , respectively , while @xmath11 is the entropy density .",
    "all experimental bounds on the neutrino ( flavour ) asymmetries are inferred indirectly from measurements of the primordial abundances of light elements , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and large scale structure ( lss ) and combinations of them .",
    "when the universe was roughly @xmath12 seconds old and had a temperature of a few mev , the neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium with the photons and @xmath7 via processes like @xmath13 , with @xmath14,@xmath15,@xmath16 .",
    "subsequent cooling of the universe allowed the neutrinos to kinetically decouple from the plasma .",
    "as muon and tau neutrinos interact via neutral currents only , they decouple first .",
    "the electron neutrinos interact further via charged - current interactions with the ambient electrons , neutrons and protons .",
    "for this reason , an asymmetry in the electron neutrinos influences the neutron - to - proton ratio at weak - interaction - freeze - out , and thereby the @xmath17he - abundance . additionally any lepton flavour asymmetry could be detected through its additional contribution to the total energy density of the universe , often expressed as the number of extra effective relativistic degrees - of - freedom of the plasma @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 are the chemical potentials of the three neutrino flavour .",
    "to be more specific , the neutrino flavour asymmetry influences the @xmath17he abundance in two ways : increasing @xmath20 would lead to a smaller @xmath21 fraction at the freeze out of the weak interaction rates and hence to a smaller @xmath17he abundance . but this effect can be compensated by increasing simultaneously @xmath22 and/or @xmath23",
    ". this would raise the expansion rate and thus lead to a higher freeze out temperature for the weak interactions and increase the @xmath17he abundance .",
    "note , that the chemical potentials in @xmath24 enter quadratically and thus a measurment of @xmath24 does not constrain the sign of the individual flavour asymmetries .",
    "thus even a vanishing net lepton asymmetry might give rise to interesting and non - vanishing lepton - flavour asymmetries , i.e. @xmath25 . the neutrino flavour asymmetries can be played against each other to match the observational bounds on light element abundances @xcite .    after the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , the total energy density of the universe consisted of photons and the three types of relativistic neutrinos .",
    "altering that energy density with a large @xmath26 , e.g. large @xmath27 , would affect the cmb spectrum by changing the redshift of matter radiation equality and by changing the amount of anisotropic stress @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of density fluctuations on small scales would be suppressed , leading to observable effects in the large scale structure @xcite .",
    "the bbn bounds on the pseudo - chemical potentials @xmath28 and on @xmath24 depend on assumptions regarding the efficiency of neutrino flavour equilibration via neutrino oscillations . before the onset of neutrino flavour oscillations ( i.e. at @xmath29 ) ,",
    "each individual lepton flavour , @xmath30 is conserved .",
    "after the onset of neutrino flavour oscillations , only the total lepton number @xmath31 remains conserved , while the individual flavour asymmetries vary .",
    "it might be that @xmath32-oscillations ensure the full equilibration of three initially different flavour asymmetries @xcite , such that the asymmetry in the electron neutrinos measured today , would be the same as in the muon and tau type . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that even large primordial asymmetries with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 equilibrate at roughly @xmath36 mev .",
    "thus , one can assume that , at least for @xmath37 , neutrino flavour equilibration happens at @xmath38 mev , well before the onset of bbn @xcite .",
    "as a consequence lss , cmb , and bbn are blind to the earlier differences in the individual lepton flavour .",
    "for this case ( @xmath39 ) , the observation of primordial abundances and wmap data constrain all three pseudo - chemical potentials : @xmath40 @xcite , assuming the lepton asymmetry to be constant between nucleosynthesis and photon decoupling . the recently reported he@xmath17 abundance by the act collaboration @xcite and the wmap7 data release lead to a significantly larger range @xmath41 @xcite .    considering only partial equilibration of three initially different flavour asymmetries via oscillations ( i.e.  @xmath42 ) , weakens the bounds on @xmath43 . assuming @xmath44 and an effective number of neutrinos @xmath45 while neglecting flavour equilibration , leads to the bound @xmath46 ( here @xmath47 ) and a total lepton asymmetry of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "we conclude , large lepton asymmetries and large lepton flavour asymmetries before the onset of neutrino oscillations are compatible with current observations .",
    "the consequences of lepton asymmetries on the cosmic qcd transition at @xmath49 mev are discussed in @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that large neutrino asymmetries influence significantly the dynamics of the qcd transition .",
    "as the electric charge , baryon and lepton flavour are preserved at the same time , a non - negligible lepton asymmetry can induce a non - vanishing baryon - chemical potential , which in turn influences the pseudo - critical temperature or even turns a crossover transition into a first order transition .    in this work",
    "we investigate an even earlier event : statistical freeze - out of the abundance of weakly interacting dark matter .",
    "we show that large lepton ( flavour- ) asymmetries ( @xmath50 ) give rise to sizeable effects on the relic abundance of wimp dark matter .",
    "in the following chapter we we will give an ( incomplete ) overview of arguments how large lepton ( flavour ) asymmetries can be generated . in the third chapter",
    "we show then , how large lepton ( flavour ) asymmetries influences the thermodynamic description of the early universe .",
    "we give analytic estimations and numerical results and show how these effect the relative relic abundance of wimp dark matter in the fourth chapter before we conclude our work in chapter 5 . throughout the article we set @xmath51 .",
    "several ideas of baryo- and leptogenesis have been proposed that lead to a universe with large lepton flavour asymmetries but small baryon asymmetry . for example , in grand unified theories asymmetries @xmath52 can be realized based on gauge invariant initial particle asymmetries @xcite .",
    "another mechanism is provided by supersymmetric theories , c.f .",
    "@xcite , which have the intriguing feature of flat directions . made up of squark or slepton fields , these directions can carry baryon and/or lepton number . during cosmological inflation these squark and sleptons",
    "are free to fluctuate and to form scalar condensates , carrying baryon and/or lepton number , and to release these charges by decaying to standard - model particles .",
    "this is called the affleck - dine mechanism @xcite , and in principle can give rise to large asymmetries in baryons or leptons .    in the early universe ,",
    "large asymmetries have to be produced after an inflationary phase , otherwise they diluted away by the inflationary expansion and washed out by the huge increase in entropy density during post - inflationary reheating . another possibility to dilute a large lepton ( flavour ) asymmetry are sphaleron transitions at high temperatures .",
    "these transitions violate @xmath53 and @xmath54 , but preserve @xmath55 .",
    "sphalerons are the reason for suggesting @xmath56 .",
    "note that this does not necessarily mean @xmath57 .",
    "for instance , two flavours could be orders of magnitude larger , if their sum almost cancels , @xmath58 for lepton flavours @xmath59",
    ".    however , sphaleron transitions might never be in equilibrium and the argument in favor of @xmath60 would disappear .",
    "it was shown that , if the total asymmetry @xmath61 is larger than a critical value @xmath62 then electroweak symmetry is never restored and sphalerons are suppressed for all times @xcite . a large lepton ( flavour )",
    "asymmetry would survive until today .",
    "it is remarkable that recent bounds on the electron - neutrino asymmetry from wmap-7yr alone and combined with the act data are in the vicinity of this limit .    in @xcite",
    "the authors combine the affleck - dine mechanism with the suppressed sphalerons .",
    "they consider a model with a sneutrino condensate to generate large @xmath54-asymmetries , @xmath63 , but no baryon asymmetry . in their specific model",

    ", their model leads to asymmetries @xmath66 to 1 . in @xcite it is shown how the electroweak symmetry non - restoration due to a large @xmath54-asymmetry works with a small baryon asymmetry . how to regulate the baryon asymmetry in affleck - dine mechanisms",

    "we demonstrated how a large @xmath198 influences the relic wimp abundance in figure [ fig : deltamulf ] . if the asymmetries are equal in in all flavour , @xmath205 and @xmath210 we found a huge effect on the relative relic abundance of approximately 20 per cent .",
    "even if the total lepton asymmetry is of the order of the baryon asymmetry , but individual flavour asymmetries are large before the onset of neutrino oscillations , a reduction of the wimp relic density of up to @xmath211 is possible .",
    "the effect presented in this work adds to the astrophysical and particle physics uncertainties to be accounted for in direct and indirect dark matter searches .",
    "large lepton ( flavour ) asymmetries could be compensated by decreasing annihilation cross sections , in order to keep the relic abundance of a wimp candidate fixed .",
