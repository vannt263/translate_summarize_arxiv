    "the status of measurements of cmb polarization has evolved rapidly .",
    "only a year separates the publication of tight upper limits  @xcite and the detection of polarization  @xcite . in the summer of 2001",
    ", we started designing the instrument .",
    "is a 16-element array comprised of twelve 90  ghz and four 40  ghz correlation receivers ( four 90  ghz elements have been deployed for initial observations since february 2003 ) . a new feed system has been designed to couple to the 7-meter crawford hill antenna to produce a 4@xmath0 beam .",
    "the goal is to concentrate sensitivity on a @xmath1 diameter cap around the north celestial pole ( ncp ) .",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : senfac ] , will probe higher angular scales than those probed by map and dasi , and will be sensitive to the predicted peak in polarization .",
    "i will discuss in more details specifics of the telescope , the optics , and the receivers .",
    "n , lon@xmath2w and 119 meters of elevation . ) ]    in order to achieve high angular resolution , uses the lucent technologies 7-meter offset cassegrain antenna located in holmdel , nj at the crawford hill observatory .",
    "built in 1977 , it was originally designed to test polarization multiplexing of signals to geosynchronous satellites at k band and for radio astronomy up to 300 ghz . as a result , it demonstrates many of the requirements necessary for cmb measurements :    * low sidelobe level .",
    "* low cross polarization level .",
    "* good pointing accuracy and tracking capabilities on an alt - az mount . *",
    "large f / d ratio , large useable focal plane . * temperature - controlled cassegrain focus room .    a detailed description of the antenna can be found in the bell labs technical journal  @xcite .",
    "prior to the summer of 2001 , when we started using the antenna , it had primarly been used during the last eight years to train winter - over operators for the south pole ast / ro telescope .",
    "we invested large amounts of work in the following two years to repair and upgrade the various mechanical , electrical , and software systems .",
    "20k and the lens to the first stage at @xmath3  100k . ]",
    "if the full aperture were used , the 7-meter antenna would produce a @xmath4 beam in the sky .",
    "this resolution is smaller than needed to probe the scales where the polarization peaks , at 10@xmath0 or @xmath5  1000 .",
    "thus , the feed system is designed to produce a fwhm beam size of 4@xmath0 and to minimize pickup of stray radiation from the ground .",
    "this is achieved by aggressively under - illuminating both mirrors .",
    "the secondary and primary edge illuminations are respectively -56db and -30db .",
    "the small ( @xmath6 ) beam pattern required to produce such low edge tapers is the main price that must be paid for the advantage of the large effective focal ratio of @xmath7 .",
    "a standard small - angle corrugated horn had to be rejected as a feed because its size would make it prohibitive to cryogenically cool and because its sidelobe pattern could not be controlled to the desired level .",
    "the solution for the feed optics is a 3  cm aperture corrugated feedhorn followed by a 12  cm diameter hdpe meniscus lens shown in figure  [ fig : hornandlens ] .",
    "the lens is held in front of the horn with a metal shroud .",
    "the shroud is coated with a @xmath8 thick microwave absorbing honeycomb to prevent stray radiation from illuminating the horn .",
    "this feed system produces the necessary beam size ( @xmath9 fwhm at 90 ghz ) to achieve the designed secondary illumination and was optimized to keep its sidelobes below @xmath3  -40  db ( see figure  [ fig : beammap ] ) .",
    "we note that because this antenna in not surrounded by ground screens , the extreme under - illumination and the obsessive control of sidelobes are necessary design features to keep the spillover below levels that would interfere with the observation of cmb polarization .      because of its slow optics , the crawford hill telescope is well suited for an array of receivers at its focus .",
    "to determine the size of distortions for receivers displaced from the focal point , we performed extensive studies using both measurements from receivers at different positions in the focal plane and physical optics simulations  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : beam ] ( left ) shows a simulated beam contour plot for a receiver located 39 cm above the focal point and pointed towards the center of the secondary .",
    "distortions remain small even this far from the focal point .",
    "the plate scale for the focal plane is such that a 15 cm shift in the focal plane corresponds to a @xmath10 shift of the beam in the sky . for the initial deployment of four radiometers",
    ", we arranged the receivers in a 15 cm radius diamond pattern , obtaining the composite beam map in figure  [ fig : beam ] ( right ) .",
    "this configuration allows us to observe a @xmath1 diameter cap around the ncp by scanning the telescope back and forth in azimuth .",
    "this scan strategy naturally provide many systematic checks .",
    "the receivers are heterodyne correlation polarimeters . with approximately 100k system noise and 14 ghz bandwidth ,",
    "the receiver sensitivity is @xmath31  mk@xmath11 .",
    "the signal is amplified by two back - to - back mmic lnas(see section  [ sec : mmic ] ) . after being",
    "down - converted to if ( 2 - 18  ghz ) , filtered , and further amplified , the signal is detected with a correlation multiplier .",
    "the signal is phase - switched in the lo at 4  khz to avoid the @xmath12 noise of the lna , which have a @xmath12 knee before phase switching of @xmath31  khz .",
    "the if is divided into three sub - bands to allow frequency discrimination .",
    "a single lo signal is generated and then distributed to each receiver after amplification in the mmic power amplifiers .",
    "we take advantage of recent microwave technology developments by using a new generation of hemt amplifier .",
    "we use mmic lnas and power amplifers developed , integrated , and tested at jpl ( by todd gaier ) .",
    "we cascade two mmic lnas together to obtain the necessary gain .",
    "figure  [ fig : mmicfigs ]  ( right ) shows the noise temperature and gain versus frequency for a typical mmic cooled to 20k .",
    "figure  [ sec : mmic ]  ( left ) shows the distribution of noise and gains for the devices we have acquired so far .",
    "note that 20db of gain and less than 55k noise temperature are not uncommon .",
    "the capmap support electronics and data acquisition modules are all housed in the focal point cabin one meter away from the dewar . the vertex cab , support electronics , data acquisition module , and both dewar stages are temperature controlled .",
    "all such critical environmental and cryogenic temperatures are monitored and recorded at 1 hz .",
    "all radiometer channels are synchronously sampled at 96 khz using an ics-610 data acquisition board .",
    "these data are then averaged down to 4 khz , demodulated in software , and recorded at 100  hz . for this season , the azimuth scan rate was one beam per 0.3 seconds .",
    "capmap complements maxipol , b2k , cbi , dasi , and map in frequency coverage , experimental technique and angular resolution .",
    "an example of the sensitivity of to cmb polarization anisotropy is given in figure  [ fig : senfac ] .",
    "for this season , four receivers were deployed and observed during fair weather between january 16 and april 30 , 2003 with sensitivities near the predicted ones based on 100  k system noise and 14  ghz bandwidth . as indicated in figure  [ fig : beammap ] ,",
    "the beams are symmetric with acceptable sidelobes .",
    "results from this first campaign will be detailed in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we expect to deploy the full 16 element array in early november 2003 .",
    "capmap is a collaborative effort involving researchers at various institutions : jeff mcmahon , phil farese , suzanne staggs , and myself at princeton university ; keith vanderlinde , colin bischoff , matthew hedman , dorothea samtleben , and bruce winstein at university of chicago ; eugenia stefanescu and josh gundersen at university of miami ; and todd gaier at jpl ."
