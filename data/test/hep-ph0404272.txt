    "the existence of extreme - energy cosmic rays ( eecr ) with energies above the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite of about @xmath2 ev , presents an outstanding problem  @xcite .",
    "nucleons and photons with those energies have short attenuation lengths and could only come from distances of 100 mpc or less  @xcite , while plausible astrophysical sources for those energetic particles are much farther away .    data from the hires experiment @xcite brought the violation of the gzk cutoff into question . yet",
    "the ee events in even the hires data set remain unexplained since the local universe ( @xmath3  mpc ) is devoid of strong candidate sources .",
    "this controversy will be solved conclusively by the pierre auger hybrid observatory  @xcite , perhaps as soon as summer of 2005 . here",
    "we assume that the published agasa spectrum is correct .",
    "interestingly , it is the absence of events above @xmath4  ev in these data , rather than the presence of events above @xmath5  ev , that motivates this work .    among the solutions proposed for the origin of the highest energy events observed by agasa , an elegant and economical solution to this problem is the `` z - burst '' mechanism : annihilation at the @xmath6-resonance of extreme - energy neutrinos ( @xmath7 ) coming from remote sources , and relic background neutrinos within @xmath8  mpc of earth , produces the nucleon and photon eecrs  @xcite .",
    "the observed eecrs from the z - bursts are the emission analogues of the absorption features ( z - dips ) predicted long ago  @xcite .",
    "one of the most appealing features of the @xmath6-burst mechanism is that the energy scale of @xmath9  ev at which the unexpected events have been detected , is generated naturally .",
    "the @xmath6-resonance occurs when the energy of the incoming @xmath7 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is any of the three masses of the relic neutrinos .",
    "given the lower limit @xmath12  ev deduced from atmospheric oscillations for the heaviest neutrino mass , at least one @xmath13 is below @xmath14  ev .",
    "since the individual energies of the nucleons and photons emerging from the z - burst can not exceed the total energy of the burst , @xmath13 is the new end - point of the eecr energy - spectrum in this mechanism . partitioning this burst energy among the @xmath15 final state particles ,",
    "one arrives at precisely the primary energies needed to produce events observed above the gzk energy .",
    "combining their recent measurements of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation with data on the large scale structure of the universe , wmap  @xcite produced a strong limit on neutrino masses , @xmath16  ev .",
    "since a single neutrino mass above @xmath12  ev implies near mass - degeneracy for all three active neutrinos ( given the mass - squared splittings from neutrino oscillation data , described below ) one has @xmath17  ev at the 95% cl .",
    "however , objections  @xcite to the priors assumed , or to the data sets included , have led to a relaxed bound @xmath18  ev , or @xmath19  ev .",
    "a subsequent analysis  @xcite which includes wmap , 2df , and sdss data , and another which includes these and galaxy cluster data  @xcite , have arrived at the bound , @xmath20  ev . still another analysis  @xcite with cmb and lss data finds @xmath21  ev , but finds @xmath22  ev when priors from supernova data and the hubble key project are included .",
    "these newer bounds are very similar to the original wmap bound .    in this work",
    "we focus on a particular feature of the agasa spectrum , namely the end - point energy . requiring that the z - burst mechanism not overproduce events beyond this agasa end - point , we derive a lower bound on the neutrino mass .",
    "the significance of an end - point energy for constraining model fluxes has been noted much earlier in the context of topological defect decay  @xcite . a more ambitious project would be to actually fit the neutrino mass to the full agasa spectrum .",
    "this has been done , by fodor , katz and ringwald ( fkr )  @xcite .",
    "however , the allowed range of the neutrino mass that results is not tight .",
    "rather , it depends sensitively on how one parameterizes the transition from non - burst spectrum to burst spectrum near and above the ankle .",
    "fkr find @xmath23 fitted mass ranges of 0.1 to 1.3  ev if all ee events are assumed to originate with z - bursts , 0.02 to 0.8  ev if an additional extra - galactic source of ee protons is allowed , and 1 to 7  ev if an additional galactic - halo source of ee protons is allowed .",
    "super - kamiokande has provided a strong evidence for the oscillation in atmospheric showers of two neutrino species with mass - squared splitting @xmath24 = @xmath25 = @xmath26  ev , consisting of nearly equal amounts of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and little or no @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "if neutrino masses are hierarchical , like the other leptons and quarks , then @xmath30 the mass of the heavier of the two oscillating neutrinos ( call it @xmath31 ) .",
    "some previous works  @xcite on z - burst production of the eecrs have made this assumption .",
    "however we will show in this work that @xmath32  ev is not compatible with the agasa end - point spectrum if z - bursts produce the eecr .",
    "the reason is that with @xmath33  ev , the new eecr cutoff @xmath34  ev predicts too many super gzk eecr events beyond the agasa end - point .",
    "as the relic neutrino mass increases , @xmath35 decreases , and the features in the ee spectrum move progressively to lower energies .",
    "in particular , the number of events predicted at high energy decreases , and the number beyond the agasa end - point becomes compatible with zero for @xmath36  ev .",
    "note that our result is much sharper than , but compatible with , the allowed mass ranges of the fkr models with no additional ee proton source , or with an additional extra - galactic source of ee protons .",
    "in the next section we present our simulations and the resulting spectrum of eecr in detail .",
    "we have performed simulations of the photon , nucleon and neutrino fluxes coming from a uniform distribution of  z - bursts \" , namely @xmath37 annihilations at the z pole ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the burst energy is given in eq .  1 .",
    "our simulations cover the range @xmath39  ev for relic neutrino mass .",
    "the z - bursts were simulated using pythia 6.125  @xcite , and the absorption of photons and nucleons was modeled using energy - attenuation lengths provided by bhattacharjee and sigl  @xcite , supplemented by radio - background models by protheroe and biermann  @xcite .",
    "we simulated a uniform distribution of about @xmath40 z particles up to a maximum @xmath41 .",
    "if other z - burst spatial distributions are used , the main features of the spectrum of the ultra - high energy nucleons , photons and neutrinos remain the same as given below .",
    "the decay of the z bosons through all possible channels was done automatically by the pythia routines  @xcite , using the default options of this program . for comparison with our later figures ,",
    "we show in fig .  1 the spectra given by pythia , normalized per z boson , for @xmath42  ev ; redshifts and energy absorption",
    "are not included in pythia .",
    "the multiplicities that pythia gives per z - decay are 1.6 nucleons , 17 photons , 15 @xmath29 , 30 @xmath43 and 0.23 @xmath44 ( in each case counting particles and antiparticles ) .        in our simulation",
    ", each z boson generated by pythia was placed on the `` event list '' of the cascade generator at a randomly selected distance .",
    "the cascade of decay products was then boosted .",
    "the @xmath45 factor corresponding to an energy @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is @xmath47 we then followed the propagation of the nucleons , photons and neutrinos resulting from the boosted z - decays .",
    "the gamma factor of the secondary particles was corrected to include their red - shifting subsequent to the z - decay .",
    "each neutrino , nucleon or photon was created by pythia in the initial cascade at a fixed position , with fixed energy and direction of motion with respect to the earth frame of reference .",
    "the distance each particle had to travel before reaching earth was compared with the appropriate attenuation length in space for the particle energy .",
    "if the distance was smaller than the attenuation length , the particle was assumed to reach earth unchanged . in the opposite case ,",
    "the energy and momentum of the particle were degraded by a factor @xmath48 after traveling a distance equal to the attenuation length ( and the particle was placed again in the list constituting the cascade at the new position , with the degraded energy and momentum ) .",
    "neutrinos do not interact in their propagation .",
    "thus , the energy spectra of the three kinds of neutrinos were simply generated by summing the number of particles over energy bins and normalizing to neutrino multiplicities per z times the total number of z particles used . on the other hand , nucleons and photons do suffer energy - absorption interactions , and here we included energy absorption .",
    "the propagation process for nucleons and photons was continued until particles reached earth and were counted in the final spectra , or until particle energies became too small to be significant . in the latter case ,",
    "the particles were simply discarded from the cascade . at this point ,",
    "the final nucleon and photon spectra were appropriately normalized to the total number of z - particles used , as was done with the neutrinos .",
    "the results are given in fig .  2 for @xmath49 , with a fit to the six most energetic occupied bins in the agasa data  @xcite .",
    "these bins consist of 24 events spanning the energy range from @xmath50  ev to @xmath51  ev .",
    "the energy - attenuation of the nucleons and especially photons requires more discussion . for nucleon attenuation , uncertainties are small , and so the predicted gzk suppression is highly credible .",
    "for the nucleon energy attenuation , we used the length given by bhattacharjee and sigl in the fig .",
    "9 of ref .  , based on results from ref .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "however , for photon energy - attenuation , the length is quite uncertain , due to the uncertain spectrum of the absorbing radio background . the photon flux shown in fig .  2 as curve  ( 1 ) results from using the attenuation length shown in fig .",
    "11 of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on observations of clark et al .",
    "protheroe and biermann  @xcite produced two models for the radio background which lead to shorter interaction lengths ( and therefore more absorption ) than those based on clark et al . from the interaction lengths they provided , we constructed approximate attenuation lengths for the models of protheroe and biermann .",
    "we did so by reducing the attenuation length based on clark et al .",
    "by the ratio of the respective interaction lengths , and obtained the curves ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in fig .  2 . since mean interaction lengths and",
    "mean energy - attenuation lengths do not have exactly the same energy dependence , our construction is an approximation .",
    "however , we believe the three curves which we display give a good representation of the possible range of predicted photon fluxes .    in this work ,",
    "we seek a bound on the of events predicted .",
    "therefore , we adopt the lowest observable photon flux , curve number ( 3 ) , associated with the maximum photon absorption , when computing the total event number .",
    "this is the photon flux shown in fig .",
    "notice that with this choice , the photon flux does not become comparable to the nucleon flux until @xmath52  ev .",
    "we add to the z - burst proton and photon fluxes a power law spectrum with slope @xmath53 , terminated somewhat arbitrarily ( as it is not known where this component actually dies out ) at @xmath54  ev .",
    "such a power law was found by agasa to fit the data below the ankle , from @xmath55 to @xmath56 ev ( see table v of @xcite ) .",
    "in fig .  4 the observed and predicted integrated number of eecr event rates above @xmath57  ev are shown for different values of the relic neutrino mass .",
    "the z - burst fluxes have been normalized to reproduce the 24 highest - energy events observed by agasa  @xcite in the energy range from @xmath50  ev to @xmath58  ev .",
    "these events are spread among the first six bins of fig .",
    "the area under each curve at the final bin shows the integrated number of events from @xmath59  ev to infinity predicted by that so - normalized z - burst flux .",
    "this number of excess events can also be read off from the value of the curve at @xmath60  ev less the 24 normalizing events .",
    "since agasa has observed no events above 2.5@xmath0  ev although their aperture remains constant with increasing energy  @xcite , it is justified to call the events predicted beyond 2.5@xmath0  ev an excess ; we label the predicted number of excess events as @xmath61 . in table  1",
    "the predicted event excess above @xmath59  ev is shown as a function of the neutrino mass .",
    "also shown is the poisson probability that a fluctuation downward from the predicted value gives zero events , as observed .",
    "this latter quantity is just @xmath62 .",
    ".poisson probabilities that no events are observed above the agasa end - point , given the excess predicted by the z - burst mechanism as a function of neutrino mass .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the probabilities show that masses lighter than @xmath1  ev have a probability less than a percent",
    ". expressed as gaussian variances , one infers from the percentages in the table that @xmath63  ev is disfavored at @xmath64 while @xmath65  ev is disfavored at only @xmath66 .",
    "together with the cosmological limit on the neutrino mass discussed earlier , the value @xmath67  ev emerges as less than robust , but viable .",
    "we remark that our definition of `` excess '' as events above @xmath59  ev is somewhat conservative in that the two highest energy agasa events occur at @xmath52  ev ( @xmath68 experimental energy - resolution ) , nearer to the beginning of the highest - energy occupied bin than to its end . on the other hand ,",
    "we have not considered in our analysis the very - highest energy event , at @xmath69  ev , from the fly s eye experiment .",
    "this is in the spirit of neglecting fluorescent data , e.g. hires , as we have chosen to focus in a self - consistent way on just the ground - scintillator data set from agasa .",
    "there are three immediate inferences to be drawn from the preferred neutrino mass value .",
    "the first is that since the energy of no secondary from the z - burst may exceed the burst energy , the model predicts a new cutoff for eecrs . with 0.3",
    "ev relic neutrinos , the cutoff energy is @xmath70  ev .",
    "given the large mean - multiplicity in z - decay , @xmath71 , a more realistic cutoff in the model is @xmath72  ev .",
    "future experiments such as auger , anita , rice , euso , and salsa may be able to test this prediction .",
    "the second inference is that with @xmath67  ev , a significant clustering of relic neutrinos around very large galactic super - clusters is expected @xcite .",
    "this clustering could be evidenced as an enhancement of the eecr flux coming from the direction of m87 , just 16  mpc away , near the virgo center . and",
    "the third inference is that given the smallness of mass - squared differences inferred from neutrino oscillation experiments , @xmath67  ev implies near mass - degeneracy for the three active neutrinos .",
    "mass - degeneracy enhances the possibility of directly observing absorptive `` z - dips '' in the ee neutrino spectrum  @xcite .",
    "we note that our analysis of the spectral shape of the agasa data does not depend on the issue of rate .",
    "in particular , it does not depend on the eecr neutrino flux and it does not depend on the value of the relic neutrino target density .",
    "the latter could , in principle , be enhanced by either gravitational clustering or by a lepton asymmetry . in practice , simulations argue against gravitational clustering for light ( @xmath73  ev ) neutrinos on all but the very largest super - galactic mass - scales @xcite ( which comprise a small solid angle of sky ) , and bbn physics argues against a lepton asymmetry enhancement above @xmath74% @xcite . ( strictly speaking , the bbn limit is strongest for @xmath29 s , but the large lepton mixing angles inferred from oscillation studies extend the limit equally to @xmath27 s and @xmath28 s . ) regardless of these kinds of rate arguments , our bound on the neutrino mass holds .",
    "farrar and piran  @xcite have argued that any mechanism accounting for the events beyond the gzk cutoff should also account for the events down to the ankle , including the observed isotropy and spectral smoothness .",
    "it is seen in our fig .  2 that the z - burst mechanism can accommodate the position of the ankle and all the events above it , if the position of the ankle is close to that measured by agasa , at @xmath75  ev ( see @xcite , in particular table v , and references therein ) .",
    "fly s eye claims a value for @xmath76  ev , a factor of three smaller than the agasa value ( see table v of @xcite ) .",
    "this value is difficult to accommodate with the z - burst mechanism , although one could perhaps gain agreement by increasing @xmath77 of the astrophysical neutrino sources .",
    "this would allow for more red - shifting of the nucleons , thereby lowering the soft end of the z - burst spectrum .",
    "a higher @xmath77 may be expected , for example , if the source is decaying massive particles or topological defects .",
    "the fit of the agasa data with our total flux provides the normalization of the photon and nucleon differential fluxes @xmath78 , denoted as @xmath79 in figs .  2 and 3 ( in this case @xmath80 = @xmath81 @xmath82 ) .",
    "this allows us to determine the ( assumed homogeneous and isotropic ) flux of extreme - energy neutrinos close to the @xmath6-resonance energy ( more precisely , within the energy interval from @xmath83 to @xmath13 ) to be @xmath84 this flux is shown in figs .  2 and 3 , with the label  @xmath7 \" . within the level of accuracy of our simulation",
    ", we only determine the order of magnitude of this flux .",
    "nevertheless , the flux requirement is formidable .",
    "this very - high energy flux is at present marginally ruled - out by present glue  @xcite and forte  @xcite bounds , as can be seen in figs .  2 and 3",
    "( see also @xcite ) the large required flux in the z - burst hypothesis is also a challenge to theory .",
    "it appears that new physics is required to produce such a large neutrino flux at such extreme energy @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we have not included any effects of extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "for the analysis of this paper to hold as is , these fields should be sufficiently small , @xmath85 .",
    "a way to weaken the bound derived here would be to assume the existence of large enough extragalactic magnetic fields , say @xmath86 or larger , so that through electron pair - production and subsequent synchrotron radiation , photons would be eliminated as eecr primaries .",
    "this would reduce the event count above the agasa end - point , and so allow a smaller neutrino mass .",
    "however in this case the flux of ee neutrinos at the z - resonance energy , @xmath87 , required to produce the observed eecr s would be larger .",
    "moreover , the resonant energy , @xmath35 , would be larger .",
    "both the increased flux and the increased energy bring this possibility into conflict with the glue and forte bounds , on ee neutrino fluxes , shown in figs .  2 and 3 . specifically , we find that without the photon contribution to the z - burst flux , we would require @xmath88 at @xmath89 for @xmath90  ev , or @xmath91 at @xmath92 for @xmath93  ev .",
    "such possibilities are rejected by the glue and forte bounds .",
    "another prediction of the z - burst mechanism is the enhancement of the event rate at the gzk cutoff energy , @xmath94  ev , due to the accumulation of nucleons after energy - attenuation .",
    "such an enhancement ( or `` gzk bump '' ) is expected from any model which provides a nucleon spectrum flatter than @xmath95 above @xmath96 ( spectra falling faster than @xmath95 do not provide sufficient flux above @xmath96 to make an observable pile - up . ) .",
    "a hint for such a bump is seen in the agasa data , fig .  2 and 3",
    ". however , one must be careful in interpreting the shape as an enhancement .",
    "an alternative explanation of the shape feature has been provided in @xcite , namely that another energy - loss mechanism , @xmath97 , depletes the flux at energies just below @xmath96 .",
    "finally , a reliable prediction of the model is that most primaries above the ankle should be nucleons up to @xmath98  ev or more , and photons and protons at higher energies .",
    "a much larger event sample is needed to test this prediction .",
    "the non - observation of cosmic ray events at energies higher than @xmath99 ev by agasa provides a lower bound of about 0.3  ev on relic neutrino masses , if z - bursts are responsible for the eecrs .",
    "this bound together with comparisons of the microwave background anisotropy to today s large - scale structure , leave a small interval for the relic neutrino mass , centered around 0.3 ev , if z - bursts explain the eecrs .",
    "the @xmath1  ev mass provides a very accessible signal for neutrinoless double beta - decay experiments ( assuming neutrinos are majorana particles ) , and is in fact compatible with a reported positive signal  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath1  ev mass interval may also be probed by the future katrin tritium end - point experiment  @xcite , and by expected improvements to the astrophysical bound from weak lensing of distant galaxies by intervening matter distributions  @xcite , and from mining future planck measurements of the cmb  @xcite .",
    "we note that our small allowed range for @xmath11 is incompatible with an upper bound of 0.15  ev that arises from invoking the see - saw mass spectrum as a source of successful early - universe baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "we have not included in this work any possible effects of extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "for the analysis of this paper to hold as is , these fields should be sufficiently small , @xmath100 .",
    "a survey of the literature shows that extragalactic fields much larger than @xmath101 are not expected , except in regions around galaxy clusters . in any event , large extragalactic magnetic fields which would reduce or eliminate the ee photon component of the z - bursts ( thus lowering the neutrino mass we obtain ) would also lead to larger required ee neutrino fluxes at the z - resonance energy",
    "this possibility is rejected by the glue and forte bound .",
    "we have shown that @xmath6-bursts may account not only for the super gzk events , but for the  ankle \" and all eecr events above it . in doing so",
    ", the @xmath6-burst mechanism meets the  naturalness \" requirements of isotropy and spectral smoothness . in our simulation",
    "we found the  ankle \" close to @xmath102  ev as measured by agasa .",
    "we found that most eecr primaries above the ankle should be nucleons up to about @xmath98  ev and nucleons and photons at higher energies .",
    "we also found that primary nucleons do accumulate at the gzk cutoff energy , which could account for the slight accumulation seen in the data ( see , however , @xcite ) .    with @xmath67",
    "ev needed to accommodate the agasa end - point , the z - burst hypothesis predicts a new absolute energy cutoff for eecrs , at @xmath103 .",
    "however , due to the large multiplicity in z - decay , the vast majority of incident primaries are expected to carry only a few percent of this cutoff energy .    in summary , we believe that the @xmath6-burst mechanism provides a plausible explanation to the puzzle of extreme - energy cosmic rays , not only for the super gzk events , but for the `` ankle '' and all events above it . but the hypothesis will stand or fall on the required nearness of @xmath11 to 0.3  ev , and/or on the proximity of the required neutrino flux at @xmath104  ev to existing flux limits .",
    "if z - bursts are invalidated as the source of the observed eecrs , then we would encourage future , larger experiments ( e.g. , auger , euso ) to continue the search for z - burst signatures , for they provide the only known window to discovery of the relic neutrino background .",
    "the z - burst mechanism is entirely standard model particle physics coupled with standard hot big - bang cosmology .",
    "consequently , the mechanism itself can not be ruled out . however , the z - burst rate depends linearly on the resonant - energy neutrino flux which nature provides",
    ". nature may not be generous .",
