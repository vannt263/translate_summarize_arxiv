    "since dirac @xcite , it is known that the light - front hypersurface given by @xmath1 ( null - plane ) is suitable for defining the initial state of a relativistic system .",
    "relativistic models with null - plane wave - functions have becoming widely used in particle phenomenology @xcite .",
    "they permit to calculate the matrix elements of certain operators in a framework of a fixed number of constituents , while mantaining a limited covariance , under transformations that keeps the null - plane invariant @xcite .",
    "as the generators of rotations around @xmath2 and @xmath3-axis do not belong to the stability group @xcite , the covariance of a composite null - plane wave - function with a fixed number of constituents can be broken .",
    "this fact has consequences , for example , in the calculation of the electromagnetic form - factors of a composite spin one particle in the light - front@xcite .",
    "it is well known that , the @xmath4 component of the current , looses its rotational invariance and consequently violates the angular condition in a light - front calculation @xcite .",
    "the light - front matrix elements are computed with a null - plane wave - function@xcite in the breit - frame , where the vector component of the momentum transfer is along the @xmath2-direction .",
    "if rotational symmetry around the @xmath2-axis is valid , then @xmath5 , where the subscripts are the polarizations of the spin one particle in the cartesian instant - form spin basis @xcite .",
    "such requirement is the angular condition@xcite .",
    "it can also be derived in the front - form spin basis , using general arguments of parity and rotational invariance of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the breakdown of rotational symmetry , implies that , it does not exist an unique way to extract electromagnetic form - factors from the light - front matrix elements of @xmath6 , for composite systems with spin equal or higher than one .",
    "consequently , in the literature , there are different extraction schemes for spin one form - factors @xcite .",
    "recently , the issue of the breakdown of rotational covariance for the one - body component of the @xmath6 current in a light - front model , has been discussed in the calculation of @xmath0-meson form - factors with constituent quarks @xcite . in these works , it was stressed the importance of relativistic effects related to the constituent mass scale and the @xmath0-meson size .",
    "such relativistic effects are smaller in a test case of a s - wave deuteron system and the violation of the angular condition is quite small @xcite .    the judgement of the different prescriptions for obtaining electromagnetic form - factors in the non - covariant light - front calculation , which corresponds to use a specific @xmath0-meson null - plane wave - function , could be done in principle by a comparision between the results of the non - covariant and covariant calculations , within the same model .",
    "it is our aim in this work to calculate the @xmath0-meson form - factors from the covariant feynman one - loop triangle - diagram for the + component of the current , in two ways , one corresponds to the covariant calculation and the other to the non - covariant light - front calculation . below the covariant and the light - front calculations of the matrix elements of @xmath6",
    "are explained .",
    "the covariant calculation corresponds to integrate directly the momentum loop in the standart variables in the four - dimensional phase - space , integrating in @xmath7 analytically . in this case",
    ", the different prescriptions used to extract form - factors from @xmath6 , give identical results , since the matrix elements satisfy the angular condition .",
    "the non - covariant light - front calculation corresponds to the following procedure ; the matrix elements of @xmath6 are obtained from the one - loop triangle diagram , which is integrated analytically in the - component of the loop momentum ( @xmath8 ) in the breit - frame with momentum transfer @xmath9 , and numerically in @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the cauchy integration in @xmath12 takes into account only the propagator pole which corresponds to the forward propagation of the spectator particle , in the photon absorption process .",
    "this in principle should be correct , as have been discussed in the context of spin zero bound state particles @xcite .",
    "however , we found numerically that the integration in @xmath12 is not exact in the present case of spin 1 composite particle .",
    "the resulting matrix elements of @xmath6 do not satisfy the angular condition and the form - factors now depend on the prescription used .",
    "our numerical calculations show the difference between the two ways of performing the integrations .",
    "this may sound surprising , but we remind the reader that the @xmath12 integration is in general tricky and even in simple cases , taking into account only the forward propagating particle pole may give wrong results .",
    "the interested reader can find examples in ref.@xcite with such problems .",
    "the integration in @xmath12 , taking into account only the above mentioned pole is equivalent to the use of a wave - function in the null - plane to obtain form - factors in the breit - frame@xcite .    to deal with a finite value for the triangle - diagram",
    ", we introduce a covariant regulator , in a manner proposed in ref .",
    "this allows the covariant integration to be finite in one side and in the other side the covariant regularization generates a null - plane @xmath0-meson quark wave - function @xcite .",
    "we compare the covariant and light - front results for the @xmath0-meson form - factors , and then , we are able to point out the appropriate prescription to evaluate the form - factors of the @xmath0-meson with the null - plane wave - function .",
    "this work is relevant in pratical situations , when one is faced with the problem of which light - front prescription to use in the calculation of the @xmath0-meson electromagnetic form - factors . in the present case ,",
    "the parameters of the model are chosen such that it reproduces to some extend the @xmath0-meson electromagnetic properties predicted by a realistic qcd inspired model @xcite .",
    "the plan of the work is the following : in section ii is discussed the different extraction schemes for obtaining the spin one electromagnetic form - factors , from @xmath6 , and the notation is defined . in section iii , the matrix elements of @xmath6 are obtained from the feynman triangle - diagram , and the covariant and light - front calculations of the form - factors are discussed .",
    "the covariant regularization is shown to be related to the null - plane wave - function . in section iv , it is presented the numerical results for the @xmath0-meson form - factors calculated in both frameworks and a summary of the main findings are given .",
    "the general expression of the electromagnetic current of a spin - one particle has the form @xcite :    @xmath13 p^\\mu - f_3(q^2)(q_\\alpha g_\\beta^\\mu- q_\\beta g_\\alpha^\\mu ) \\ , \\label{eq : curr1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath14 is the @xmath0-meson mass , @xmath15 is the momentum transfer and @xmath16 is the sum of the initial and final momentum .",
