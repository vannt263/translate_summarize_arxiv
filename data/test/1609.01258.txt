    "ads / qcd models , inspired in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , provide an important phenomenological tool for describing hadronic properties in the low - energy regime , where qcd is non perturbative .",
    "the hadronic states are represented in the dual supergravity picture by normalizable solutions of fields that live in a five - dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads@xmath0 ) space , endowed with a hard @xcite or soft @xcite infrared ( ir ) cut off .",
    "the cut off in ads space breaks conformal invariance , introducing a mass parameter in the models , that sets the scale for the mass spectra of hadrons .",
    "glueballs are bound states of gluons , that are expected to appear in high energy physical processes , as a consequence of the self - coupling of gluons in qcd .",
    "conclusive experimental data , about these type of particles , still lack .",
    "lattice qcd provides an important tool to calculate glueball masses ( see for example @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the decay process of glueballs ( and other hadrons ) is in general difficult to describe .",
    "one of the problems faced is that radially excited states , that have the same quantum numbers , get mixed in lattice imaginary time numerical simulations .",
    "the conditional entropy is an interesting tool for investigating the configurational stability underlying physical systems .",
    "it has recently been shown , for the case of mesons , that the conditional entropy measures the relative occurrence of the physical states @xcite , suggesting that the entropy indeed provides information about the relative stability of states . here",
    "we will apply the lattice approach of shannon entropy @xcite and its statistical mechanics underlying structure , described in @xcite , to the glueball case .",
    "we shall represent the glueballs using a recent model proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , that is a modified soft - wall model and provides nice fits of glueball masses for even and odd spins .",
    "we will develop a procedure that leads to a relation between the glueballs spins  and the glueballs masses  and the associated conditional entropy .",
    "this analysis can shed some light into the relative stability of the different glueball states .",
    "the so - called information entropy setup is related to the irresolution of information in a physical system @xcite .",
    "besides , the conditional entropy can extend the shannon information entropy @xcite to some continuum limit of modes , that comprise the physical system .",
    "recently , the modal fractions  in information entropy theory  were defined as the ratio between collective coordinates and the structure factor  in the thermodynamical entropy setup  further providing the statistical mechanical analogue of the conditional entropy setup @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii , the anomalous dynamical ads / qcd holographic model is introduced by a dilaton - graviton bulk action , with a subsequent scalar glueball action . a beta function with an ir fixed point , at finite coupling ,",
    "is then used in the model .",
    "the dimension of the operators in the @xmath1 cft is used for defining the 5-dimensional glueball mass , and hence , the 4-dimensional glueball mass , as a function of the glueball spin and the beta function . employing the collective coordinates and the structure factor , calculated upon the energy density of the system ,",
    "the thermodynamical entropy is a foundation to compute the conditional entropy associated with glueball states .",
    "hence the information entropy , and the stability of glueballs , are quantitatively studied , for different values of the model parameters . our concluding remarks are presented in sect .",
    "the energy density of the bulk modes , associated with the glueball states , is a relevant tool for the information entropy analysis of the glueballs stability , in the ads / qcd framework .",

    "the search for this state has been , and still is , in the center of vivid activity in the framework of low - energy qcd .",
    "this state is also important because it is related to two basic phenomena of qcd : the generation of the gluon condensate and also the anomalous breaking of dilatation invariance @xcite .",
