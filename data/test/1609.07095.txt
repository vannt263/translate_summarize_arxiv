    "in his 1939 paper  @xcite , wigner considered the subgroups of the lorentz group whose transformations leave the four - momentum of a given particle invariant .",
    "these subgroups are called wigner s little groups and dictate the internal space - time symmetries in the lorentz - covariant world .",
    "he observed first that a massive particle at rest has three rotational degree of freedom leading to the concept of spin .",
    "thus the little group for the massive particle is like o(3 ) .",
    "wigner observed also that a massless particle can not be brought to its rest frame , but he showed that the little group for the massless particle also has three degrees of freedom , and that this little is locally isomorphic to the group e(2 ) or the two - dimensional euclidean group .",
    "this means that the generators of this little group share the same set of closed commutation relations with that for two - dimensional euclidean group with one rotational and two translational degrees of freedom .    it is not difficult to associate the rotational degree of freedom of e(2 ) to the helicity of the massless particle",
    "however , what is the physics of the those two translational degrees of freedom ?",
    "wigner did not provide the answer to this question in his 1939 paper  @xcite .",
    "indeed , this question has a stormy history and the issue was not completely settled until 1990  @xcite , fifty one years after 1939 .    in this report , it is noted first that the lorentz group has six generators . among them , three of them generate the rotation subgroup .",
    "it is also possible to construct three generators which constitute a closed set of commutations relations identical to that for the e(2 ) group .",
    "however , it is also possible to construct the cylindrical group with one rotational degree of freedom and two degrees freedom both leading to up - down translational degrees freedom .",
    "these two translational degrees freedom correspond to one gauge degree of freedom for the massless particle  @xcite .    while the o(3)-like and e(2)-like little groups are different , it is possible to derive the latter as a lorentz - boosted o(3)-like little group in the infinite - momentum limit .",
    "it is shown then that the two rotational degrees of freedom perpendicular momentum become one gauge degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the e(2)-like symmetry for the massless spin-1 particle leads to its helicity and gauge degree of freedom . likewise , there is a gauge degree of freedom for the massless spin-1/2 particle .",
    "however , the requirement of gauge invariance leads to the polarization of massless neutrinos  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ little ] , we introduce wigner s little groups for massive and massless particles . in sec .",
    "[ o3e2 ] , it is shown that the e(2)-like little group for massless particles can be obtained as the infinite - momentum limit of the o(3)-like little group . in sec .",
    "[ spinhalf ] , the same logic is developed for spin - half particles .",
    "it is shown that the polarization of massless neutrinos is a consequence of gauge invariance .",
    "if we use the four - vector convention @xmath0 , the generators of rotations around and boosts along the @xmath1 axis take the form @xmath2 respectively .",
    "we can also write the four - by - four matrices for @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the rotations around the @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions , as well as @xmath7 and @xmath8 for lorentz boosts along the @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions respectively  @xcite .",
    "these six generators satisfy the following set of commutation relations .",
    "@xmath9 = i\\epsilon_{ijk } j_{k } , \\qquad \\left[j_{i } , k_{j}\\right ] = i\\epsilon_{ijk } k_{k } , \\qquad \\left[k_{i } , k_{j}\\right ] = -i\\epsilon_{ijk } j_{k}.\\ ] ] this closed set of commutation relations is called the lie algebra of the lorentz group .",
    "the three @xmath10 operators constitute a closed subset of this lie algebra .",
    "thus , the rotation group is a subgroup of the lorentz group .",
    "in addition , wigner in 1939  @xcite considered a group generated by @xmath11 these generators satisfy the closed set of commutation relations @xmath12 = 0 , \\qquad \\left[j_{3 } , n_{1}\\right ] = in_{2 } , \\qquad \\left[j_{3 } , n_{2}\\right ] = -in_{1}.\\ ] ]     group and the cylindrical group .",
    "they share the same lie algebra , but only the cylindrical group leads to a geometrical interpretation of the gauge transformation . ]    as wigner observed in 1939  @xcite , this set of commutation relations is just like that for the generators of the two - dimensional euclidean group with one rotation and two translation generators , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cylin ] . however , the question is what aspect of the massless particle can be explained in terms of this two - dimensional geometry .",
    "indeed , this question has a stormy history , and was not answered until 1987 . in their paper of 1987  @xcite ,",
    "kim and wigner considered the surface of a circular cylinder as shown in fig .",
    "[ cylin ] . for this cylinder , rotations are possible around the @xmath1 axis .",
    "it is also possible to make translations along the @xmath1 axis as shown in fig .",
    "[ cylin ] .",
    "we can write these generators as @xmath13 applicable to the three - dimensional space of @xmath14 they then satisfy the closed set of commutation relations @xmath15 = 0 , \\qquad \\left[l_{3 } , q_{1}\\right ] = iq_{2 } , \\qquad \\left[l_{3 } , q_{2}\\right ] = -iq_{1}.\\ ] ] which becomes that of eq.([eq200 ] ) when @xmath16 and @xmath17 are replaced by @xmath18 and @xmath19 of eq.([eq005 ] ) respectively . indeed , this cylindrical group is locally isomorphic to wigner s little group for massless particles .",
    "let us go back to the generators of eq.([eq005 ] ) .",
    "the role of @xmath19 is well known .",
    "it is generates rotations around the momentum and corresponds to the helicity of the massless particle .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 matrices take the form  @xcite @xmath22 the transformation matrix is @xmath23 & { } & \\hspace{20 mm } = \\pmatrix{1 & 0 & -u & u \\cr 0 & 1 & -v & v \\cr u & v & 1 - ( u^{2}+ v^{2})/2 & ( u^{2 } + v^{2})/2 \\cr u & v & -(u^{2 } + v^{2})/2 & 1   + ( u^{2 } + v^{2})/2 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if this matrix is applied to the electromagnetic wave propagating along the @xmath1 direction , @xmath24 which satisfies the lorentz condition @xmath25 , the @xmath26 matrix can be reduced to  @xcite @xmath27 if @xmath25 , the four - vector @xmath28 can be written as @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the four - vector @xmath31 represents the four - momentum .",
    "if the @xmath32 matrix of eq.([eq109 ] ) is applied to the above four vector , the result is @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "thus the @xmath32 matrix performs a gauge transformation when applied to the electromagnetic wave propagating along the @xmath1 direction  @xcite .",
    "from the generators of the lorentz group , it is possible to construct the four - by - four matrices for rotations around the @xmath6 axis and lorentz boosts along the @xmath1 axis as  @xcite @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the lorentz - boosted rotation matrix is @xmath36 which can be written as @xmath37 while @xmath38 , this boosted rotation matrix becomes a transformation matrix for a massless particle when @xmath39 becomes infinite . on the other hand ,",
    "it the matrix is to be finite in this limit , the angle @xmath40 has to become small .",
    "let us set @xmath41 then this four - by - four matrix becomes @xmath42 this is the lorentz - boosted rotation matrix around the @xmath6 axis .",
    "however , we can rotate this @xmath6 axis around the @xmath1 axis by @xmath43 .",
    "then the matrix becomes @xmath44 this matrix becomes @xmath26 of eq.([eq101 ] ) , if we let @xmath45",
    "let us go back to the lie algebra of the lorentz group given in eq.([eq002 ] ) .",
    "it was noted that there are six four - by - four matrices satisfying nine commutation relations .",
    "it is possible to construct the same lie algebra with six two - by - two matrices  @xcite .",
    "they are @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the pauli spin matrices . while @xmath10 are hermitian",
    ", @xmath48 are not .",
    "they are anti - hermitian .",
    "since the lie algebra of eq.([eq002 ] ) is hermitian invariant , we can construct the same lie algebra with @xmath49 this is the reason why the four - by - four dirac matrices can explain both the spin-1/2 particle and the anti - particle .    here",
    "again the @xmath10 matrices generate the rotation - like @xmath50 subgroup . here",
    "also we can consider the @xmath51-like subgroup generated by @xmath52 the @xmath20 and @xmath21 matrices take the form @xmath53    on the other hand , in the `` dotted '' representation , @xmath54 there are therefore two different @xmath32 matrices : @xmath55 and @xmath56 these are the gauge transformation matrices applicable to massless spin-1/2 particles  @xcite .      the spinors @xmath59 and @xmath60 are gauge - invariant since @xmath61 as for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 & { } & \\dot{d}(u , v ) \\dot{\\chi}_{+ } = \\dot{\\chi}_{+ } + ( u + iv)\\dot{\\chi}_{- } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they are not gauge invariant .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the polarization of massless neutrinos is a consequence of gauge invariance .",
    "if @xmath39 becomes very large , and this matrix is to remain finite , @xmath40 has to become very small , and this expression becomes @xmath68 with @xmath69 as given in eq.([gamma ] ) .",
    "this expression becomes @xmath70 in this two - by - two representation , the rotation around the @xmath1 axis is @xmath71 respectively .",
    "thus @xmath72 which becomes @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 given in eq.([eq602 ] ) .",
    "we have studied how the massive neutrino with its o(3)-like symmetry to become the massless neutrino in the massless limit .",
    "the boost parameter @xmath39 can be derived from the mass and momentum of the massive neutrino from @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the mass and the momentum of the neutrino respectively . for small values of @xmath79 ,",
    "@xmath80 which becomes large when @xmath77 becomes very small .",
    "the question is then the reverse process  @xcite .",
    "start from the massless neutrino with its gauge degree of freedom .",
    "what happens when the particle gains its mass ? in that case , the particle can be brought to its rest frame ?",
    "the matrix of eq.([eq607 ] ) is one way to bring it the rest frame , and @xmath81 becomes @xmath82 .",
    "however , what happens when @xmath81 is larger than one ? this is a challenging future question ."
