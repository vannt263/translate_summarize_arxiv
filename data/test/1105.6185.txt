    "the coulomb gauge with no negative metric provides a very clear physical picture in the sense that the color - gauss s law can be formally solved , only transverse degrees of freedom appear as dynamical degrees of freedom , and fock space is well defined .",
    "the prominent feature taking the coulomb gauge is that an instantaneous interaction , which is requisite for color confinement , shows up in the hamiltonian . in the gribov - zwanziger scenario ,",
    "the path integral is dominated by the configurations near the gribov horizon where the lowest eigenvalue of the faddeev - popov ( fp ) ghost operator vanishes @xcite .",
    "the lattice simulations show the enhancement of near - zero modes of the fp eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the color - coulomb instantaneous interaction bears a confining force .",
    "it has been also confirmed by the lattice simulations that the color - coulomb potential rises linearly at large distances and its string tension is larger than the string tension of the static wilson potential @xcite , which is expected from the zwanziger s inequality @xcite .",
    "in addition , the color - coulomb potential can be reevaluated by inverting the fp ghost matrix and this analysis has shown that its string tension almost saturates the wilson string tension @xcite .",
    "exploring the gluon propagator is a central issue for studying the confinement mechanism in qcd .",
    "the transverse would - be physical gluon propagator is expected to be suppressed in the infrared ( ir ) region due to the proximity of the gribov region in the ir direction in the gribov - zwanziger scenario @xcite .",
    "there have been a lot of lattice studies and functional analyses in the landau gauge ( see , for instance , ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "contrastingly , there are few lattice studies on the instantaneous gluon propagator in the coulomb gauge @xcite . in the continuum theory ,",
    "on the other hand , there are many works on the variational approach in the coulomb gauge , which are very useful to study the spectrum of the hadronic bound states and the green s functions @xcite , in addition to the functional analysis @xcite .",
    "the coulomb gauge fixing condition is imposed on each time slice and it does not introduce correlations between neighboring time slices .",
    "accordingly , the equal - time correlation between gauge fields at different points @xmath0 is well defined in the coulomb gauge .",
    "recent lattice studies of the instantaneous gluon propagator revealed that it shows scaling violation @xcite ; namely , the gluon propagator calculated at different lattice couplings do not fall on top of one curve after multiplicative renormalization .    in order to circumvent the problem of scaling violation ,",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite have extracted the instantaneous gluon propagator by eliminating the @xmath1 dependence of the unequal - time propagator .",
    "it has been concluded that the instantaneous transverse gluon propagator @xmath2 is multiplicatively renormalizable in the hamiltonian limit and the numerical data of it are well fitted with the gribov - type form of the propagator ( or @xmath1 in momentum space ) but the unequal - time one does . ]",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 is a fitting parameter at which the propagator shows a turnover .",
    "the method was applied to the transverse gluon propagator successfully both in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensional su(2 ) yang - mills theory @xcite while it does not improve the scaling violation of the temporal gluon propagator since the time - time component of the unequal - time gluon propagator is energy independent even after the residual gauge fixing @xcite .    as another approach ,",
    "a new momentum cut is introduced in ref.@xcite in addition to the cone cut and the cylinder cut .",
    "high momentum data that suffer from discretization errors are excluded from the analysis of the instantaneous propagators by this new cut . combined with the matching analysis given in ref.@xcite",
    ", it has been shown that this procedure successfully reduces the scaling violation for the transverse gluon propagator , but it fails for the time - time component of the gluon propagator .    in this study , we take a different route to show that the instantaneous gluon propagator is multiplicatively renormalizable . the problem of scaling violation of the instantaneous propagator can be seen even at the tree level with a finite temporal lattice spacing as was discussed in ref.@xcite ( we shall briefly review the point in appendix  [ sec : dtr_free ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the energy integral does not run from @xmath5 to @xmath6 but from @xmath7 to @xmath8 on a finite lattice , and this introduces the spurious @xmath9 dependence on the free instantaneous propagator .",
    "therefore , we expect that the instantaneous propagator is multiplicatively renormalizable in the hamiltonian limit @xmath10 . to make this point clear , we calculate the transverse and the time - time components of the instantaneous gluon propagator on anisotropic lattices and show how the scaling violation becomes milder as the anisotropy increases , i.e. , as we get close to the hamiltonian limit .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the subsequent sections ,",
    "we describe the lattice observables , the space and time components of the instantaneous gluon propagator , and the lattice setup of our numerical simulations . in secs .",
    "[ sec : dtr_isotropic ] and [ sec : d44_isotropic ] , the numerical results of the transverse and the temporal components of the instantaneous propagators on the isotropic lattice are reported .",
    "section [ sec : dtr_anisotropic ] is devoted to show the results for the transverse propagator on the anisotropic lattices .",
    "in the subsequent secs .  [ sec : dtr_anisotropic_fit ] , we discuss the ir and the ultraviolet ( uv ) behavior of the propagator by making the power law fitting .",
    "the anisotropic lattice results for the temporal gluon propagator are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : z44_anisotropic ] , and the ir and the uv fittings are examined in sec .",
    "[ sec : z44_anisotropic_fit ] .",

    "the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we calculate the transverse and the time - time components of the instantaneous gluon propagator , @xmath11 in the momentum space , @xmath12 where the gauge fields are related to the link variables through @xmath13 the instantaneous gluon propagator is evaluated on each time slice and we average over all time slices .",
    "the lattice momenta @xmath14 are discretized and take integer values in the range @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the lattice momenta and the continuum ones are related via @xmath16 where @xmath17 are @xmath18 for @xmath19 to @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "we note that the unequal - time propagator @xmath23 has mass dimension 2 in momentum space , while the instantaneous one has mass dimension 1 .",
    "this is because the instantaneous propagator is obtained by integrating the unequal - time propagator over the time component of the four momentum ; @xmath24    the unrenormalized transverse gluon propagator @xmath25 , which is measured by lattice simulations , is related to the renormalized propagator @xmath26 via the multiplicative renormalization , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the renormalization point .",
    "we expect that the renormalized propagator is independent of the lattice spacing in the scaling regime .",
    "as we shall see later , the multiplicative renormalizability does not hold for finite temporal lattice spacing and we have to take the hamiltonian limit , @xmath10 .",
    "the color - coulomb potential plays a crucial role in the coulomb gauge qcd .",
    "it was shown that the time - time component of the gluon propagator can be decomposed into the instantaneous part and the noninstantaneous part @xcite , @xmath29 the first term in the right - hand side represents the color - coulomb potential , which is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the kernel of the instantaneous interaction , @xmath30(-\\partial_i^2)m^{-1}[a])^{ab}_{\\vec{x},\\vec{y } } \\rangle.\\ ] ] here @xmath31 is the green s function of the faddeev - popov ghost operator . in eq . , @xmath32 is assumed to be nonsingular at @xmath33 as opposed to the first term .",
    "it has been shown that both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are renormalization - group invariant @xcite ; namely , the renormalization constant for the color - coulomb potential can be set to be 1 in the continuum limit .",
    "we expect that the color - coulomb potential @xmath34 can be extracted from the instantaneous temporal gluon propagator as @xmath36 when we are in the scaling region and the lattice spacing is small enough , where @xmath37 comes from the @xmath38 function .",
    "the lattice configurations are generated by the heat - bath monte carlo technique with the standard wilson plaquette action , @xmath39 here @xmath40 indicates the plaquette operator , and @xmath41 is the lattice coupling . on the isotropic lattice ,",
    "the bare anisotropy @xmath42 is 1 and the action can be written in a familiar form @xmath43 the renormalized anisotropy @xmath44 is defined as the ratio of the spatial lattice spacing to the temporal lattice spacing , @xmath45 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath42 and @xmath44 can be determined nonperturbatively by matching the spatial and the temporal wilson loops on anisotropic lattices .",
    "we use the relation obtained by klassen for the range @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the values of the lattice spacing given in ref.@xcite for @xmath48 and in ref.@xcite for @xmath49 , where the static quark potential was measured to set the scale . for the isotropic lattice ,",
    "the scale is set by using the scaling relation obtained by necco and sommer , with the sommer scale parameter @xmath50 [ fm ] , which is applicable in the range @xmath51 @xcite .    in our simulations , the first 5000 sweeps are discarded for thermalization , and we measured the instantaneous gluon propagator for @xmath52 configurations , each of which is separated by 100 sweeps .",
    "all the lattice parameters are given in table  [ tab : lattice_setup ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : fit_vc ]",
    "it is a central interest to explore the ir behavior of the gluon propagator to reveal the confinement mechanism in qcd . in the coulomb gauge ,",
    "the instantaneous gluon propagator suffers from significant discretization errors on isotropic lattices . in this paper , we calculated the transverse and the temporal components of the instantaneous gluon propagator on isotropic and anisotropic lattices and studied the scaling behavior .",
    "we find that the transverse gluon propagator shows a nice scaling behavior on the anisotropic lattices , and scaling violation observed on the isotropic lattice almost disappear on @xmath49 anisotropic lattice .",
    "it is natural to expect that the perfect scaling behavior can be seen and the multiplicative renormalizability holds in the hamiltonian limit @xmath53 . in the ir region ,",
    "the transverse gluon propagator is strongly suppressed on both the isotropic and the anisotropic lattices and shows the turnover at about 500 [ mev ] in both cases .",
    "we also calculated the transverse gluon propagator in position space , and it shows that the correlation function quickly decreases at small distances and becomes negative in the range @xmath54 [ fm ] , and vanishes at large distances .",
    "this means that the gluon fields have no correlation beyond the hadronic scale , and it is consistent with the fact that the gluons are confined in the hadrons ( glueballs ) .",
    "the power law fitting of the transverse gluon propagator exhibits that the uv exponent @xmath55 decreases with increasing the anisotropy .",
    "this supports the expectation that the gluons behave as free massless particles at sufficiently large momentum in the continuum due to asymptotic freedom .    in order to explore the ir behavior of the transverse gluon propagator , we fitted the data with the power law and found that the extracted value of the ir exponent is positive on the isotropic and anisotropic lattices .",
    "however , our lattice is still small to extract a reliable value of the ir exponent on the anisotropic lattices .",
    "fitting the transverse gluon propagator with the gribov - type ansatz did not work in our lattice data , which successfully describe the su(2 ) lattice data employing different method to cure scaling violation @xcite , and it deserves further study whether this is due to the difference of the gauge group or the adopted prescriptions to remedy scaling violation .    for the temporal gluon propagator , scaling violation was observed both in the ir and uv regions on the isotropic lattice in contrast to the transverse propagator , for which lattice data do not suffer from discretization errors in the ir region .",
    "our results show that the lattice data on the anisotropic lattices show much better scaling behavior than that on the isotropic lattice , although the discretization errors are still seen in the ir and the uv regions .",
    "we observed that the time - time gluon propagator on the anisotropic lattice is much more enhanced in the ir region compared to that on the isotropic lattice .",
    "the turnover observed on the coarsest lattice data on isotropic lattice disappears on the finer lattices , and @xmath56 monotonically increases with decreasing the momentum on @xmath49 anisotropic lattice .",
    "however , the ir power law fitting did not work for the dressing function , although the fitted value @xmath57=1.84(1 ) on the finest lattice is close to the expected value for the linearly rising behavior of the color - coulomb potential .",
    "we again need larger lattices as the transverse gluon propagator .",
    "the logarithmic law fitting of the dressing function of the temporal propagator in the uv region indicates that the extracted @xmath58 is unacceptably small on the isotropic lattice and it takes 0.845(85 ) [ gev ] on the finest anisotropic lattice , which is the order of @xmath59 .    in position space",
    ", the linearly decreasing behavior can be seen on the anisotropic lattice , and the color - coulomb string tension obeys the zwanziger s inequality on finer anisotropic lattices . however , the extracted value is still smaller than that obtained from the correlator of the partial polyakov line .",
    "thus , we can say that although the scaling violation is softened by decreasing the temporal lattice spacing , the instantaneous temporal gluon propagator receives a contribution from the polarization term and it is difficult to extract the color - coulomb potential from the instantaneous @xmath60 for finite @xmath37 .",
    "the simulation was performed on nec sx-8r at rcnp and nec sx-9 at cmc , osaka university .",
    "we appreciate the warm hospitality and support of the rcnp administrators .",
    "this work is partially supported by grant - in - aid for jsps from monbu - kagakusyo , and grant - in - aid for scientific research by monbu - kagakusyo , grant no .",
    "the tolerance of the gauge fixing is crucial for the ir suppression of the instantaneous transverse gluon propagator . in the iterative gauge fixing on the lattice",
    ", we stop the gauge transformation if the violation of the transversality becomes less than some small number @xmath62 ; @xmath63 we set @xmath64 in our calculations . in this appendix",
    ", we examine the behavior of the instantaneous transverse gluon propagator by varying @xmath62 on the isotropic lattice .",
    "figure [ fig : dtr_tolerance ] shows @xmath2 in lattice units on @xmath65 lattice at @xmath66 for various @xmath62 . for all the cases , the measurements are done for 20 configurations and the cylinder cut is applied . we observe that the propagator does not exhibit a turnover for @xmath67 and the curve deviates from that for @xmath64 in the region @xmath68 . decreasing @xmath62 by the factor 100 diminishes the propagator at small momenta and @xmath61 coincides within the statistical errors in the range @xmath69 .",
    "a further decrease of @xmath62 suppresses @xmath61 in the ir region and the transverse propagator shows a clear turnover . although the data for @xmath70 are not depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtr_tolerance ] , they fall on top of the data for @xmath64 within the error bars . therefore , @xmath62 should be sufficiently small to explore the ir behavior of the gluon propagator and @xmath71 is small enough .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss scaling violation of the instantaneous propagator in the free field case . a more general case was discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the instantaneous transverse propagator in the continuum is given by integrating the unequal - time propagator over @xmath1 , @xmath72 in the free field case ( i.e. , at the zeroth order in the coupling ) , the four - dimensional propagator is @xmath73 and the instantaneous propagator is @xmath74    on a lattice with a finite temporal spacing @xmath37 , the @xmath1 integral is limited within the range @xmath75 .",
