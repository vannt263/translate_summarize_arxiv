    "a variety of nonequilibrium phenomena such as open flows in hydrodynamics , thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures , processes in lasers and nucleation during the first - order phase transitions , can be modelled by the complex ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "( for review and reference , see e.g. @xcite . ) of primary importance are pulse - like solitary wave solutions , which represent localised structures widely observed in nonequilibrium systems . it is well known that in the cubic ginzburg - landau equation , @xmath2 solitary waves are unstable for all positive @xmath0 , @xmath3 and real @xmath4 . in the @xmath5 case",
    ", however , they can be stabilised by the addition of quintic terms : @xmath6 with positive @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this example suggests that solitary pulses can be stable in a more general class of ginzburg - landau equations where the zero solution undergoes a subcritical ( rather than supercritical ) bifurcation to a flat nonzero solution @xcite . in eq.([glquintic ] ) , the terms with @xmath3 and @xmath0 account for linear homogeneous and nonhomogeneous losses , respectively , while the terms with @xmath4 and @xmath7 describe the cubic gain and quintic dissipation .    the present work deals with another equation of the ginzburg - landau type exhibiting the subcritical bifurcation , viz .",
    "the _ parametrically driven _",
    "ginzburg - landau : @xmath8 here , as in ( [ glcubic])-([glquintic ] ) , the positive @xmath0 and @xmath3 are the homogeneous loss and diffusion coefficients , respectively .",
    "the term with an asterisk ( indicating the complex conjugation ) represents the parametric driver .",
    "( the driver s amplitude @xmath9 can be chosen positive without loss of generality . )",
    "when @xmath10 , eq.([eq : ddcgle_bis ] ) gives the parametrically driven damped nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "this special case has been studied extensively ; in particular , stable solitary waves @xcite and their stable complexes @xcite were found , and their bifurcations and supercritical dynamics analysed @xcite .",
    "the objective of the present work is to advance beyond the nonlinear schrdinger limit .",
    "we will still keep @xmath11 but allow for a nonzero diffusion coefficient , @xmath0 .",
    "as we will see , even such a minimal generalisation gives rise to a new phenomenology of localised solutions which includes the multistability of pulses and pulse - front transitions .",
    "like the ginzburg - landau equations with intrinsic gain , the parametrically driven equation ( [ eq : ddcgle_bis ] ) arises in a wide range of physical applications .",
    "these include nonlinear faraday resonance in vertically vibrated layers of water @xcite and nonlinear lattices @xcite ; commensurate - incommensurate transitions in convective systems @xcite ; waves in nematic and cholesteric liquid crystals in rotating magnetic fields @xcite ; magnetisation waves in easy - plane ferromagnet exposed to microwave fields @xcite ; domain walls in the easy - axis ferromagnet near the curie temperature @xcite and in the easy - plane magnet in the stationary magnetic field @xcite ; nonlinear fiber lines with phase - sensitive amplification and mean - field models of degenerate optical parametric oscillators under continuous - wave pumping @xcite ; pulsed optical parametric oscillators with spectral filtering and lasers with intracavity parametric amplification @xcite . in most cases the models considered in literature are either purely diffusive ( @xmath12 ) @xcite or purely dispersive ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "however there are situations where it is crucial that @xmath0 be finite but nonzero .",
    "one physical phenomenon to which both diffusion and dispersion make essential contributions , is faraday resonance in strongly dissipative media such as viscous fluids and granular materials @xcite .",
    "another situation where @xmath13 , corresponds to nondegenerate optical parametric oscillators @xcite and fiber - optic telecommunication links ; in these contexts , the term @xmath14 represents spectral filtering in the spatial or temporal domain , respectively . in fact the applicability of eq.([eq : ddcgle_bis ] ) with nonzero @xmath0 and @xmath4 may happen to be even wider ; it is commonly held that this equation provides a phenomenological description to a broad range of pattern - forming systems @xcite .    to study the solitary wave phenomenology introduced by taking the ( @xmath15)-term into account , we will use the diffusion - free limit ( @xmath1 ) as a starting point , and perform the numerical continuation of analytical solutions available in that case , to nonzero @xmath0 .",
    "the stability of solutions obtained in this way will also be studied numerically .",
    "we will show that  switching on \" the diffusion gives rise to a sequence of stable multihumped pulses occurring in the vicinity of a certain particular value of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath16 .",
    "the closer @xmath0 is to @xmath17 , the greater is the number of multihump solutions coexisting at this @xmath0 .",
    "the solutions with more than 5 or 6 humps describe a flat  plateau \" ( where @xmath18 is equal to the stable flat nonzero solution ) sandwiched between two fronts of opposite polarity .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ flat_backgrounds ] deals mainly with spatially homogeneous solutions .",
    "in particular , we show that there is a stable flat nonzero solution for sufficiently large @xmath0 , and this uniform solution can serve as a background for solitary waves . in section [ continua ]",
    "we use perturbation - type arguments to demonstrate that both @xmath19 and @xmath20 solitons are continuable in @xmath0 and in section [ sec : adiabatic ] we construct the solutions with nonzero @xmath0 in the adiabatic approximation . the actual continuation is carried out numerically in section [ sec : continuation ] where we also examine the stability of the continued solutions . some additional insight into the bifurcation of stationary pulses",
    "is gained in section [ h_vs_c ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] summarises results of this work .",
    "we close this introduction by mentioning a recent publication @xcite which was devoted to the study of the single - humped solution of eq.([eq : ddcgle_bis ] ) , by means of an averaging technique and direct numerical simulations .",
    "neither the multistability of pulses nor the pulse - front transitions were dealt with in ref.@xcite .",
    "the transformation @xmath21 casts eq.([eq : ddcgle_bis ] ) in a ` standard ' autonomous form @xmath22 where we set @xmath11 and rescaled @xmath23 so that @xmath24 .",
    "this is the representation that we are going to work with in what follows .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : ddcgle ] ) has three time - independent spatially uniform solutions , or ` flat backgrounds ' , for short .",
    "( we do not distinguish between solutions different only in the overall sign here . )",
    "one flat solution is @xmath25 ; it will be central for this work where we are focussing on solutions decaying to zero at infinities .",
    "the other two flat solutions are given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 note that these solutions do not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "one can easily check that the zero solution is stable as long as @xmath28 , irrespectively of the value of @xmath29 .",
    "the analysis of the flat nonzero solutions is somewhat more laborious .    linearising eq.([eq : ddcgle ] ) about @xmath30 , and assuming a perturbation @xmath31 $ ] yields the dispersion relation @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( here @xmath34 stands for @xmath35 or @xmath36 , depending on which solution we are linearizing about . )",
    "the flat solution is stable iff @xmath37 , i.e. , when @xmath38 , for all real @xmath39",
    ". the latter condition amounts to an inequality @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for @xmath42 .",
    "let , first , @xmath43 . since @xmath44 , the inequality ( [ inequalityfork ] ) does not hold for @xmath45 ; hence the ` low ' background @xmath46 is always unstable .",
    "let now @xmath47 , the ` high ' background . the quadratic expression in ( [ inequalityfork ] ) will be positive for all @xmath48 if either its two roots @xmath49 and @xmath50 are both real negative or complex .",
    "( note that we can not have two real roots of opposite signs as the quadratic s constant term , @xmath51 , is always positive for @xmath52 . )",
    "whether the roots are real or complex is determined by the discriminant of the quadratic ( [ inequalityfork ] ) which can be written as @xmath53(c - c_+)(c - c_-).\\ ] ] here we have introduced @xmath54    we need to consider two cases .",
    "assume , first , that @xmath55 .",
    "in this case the discriminant is negative ( and hence , the roots @xmath56 are complex ) provided @xmath0 lies in the interval @xmath57 . on the other hand , the roots @xmath56 are real negative in this case if @xmath58 is @xmath59 and the coefficient in front of the middle term in ( [ inequalityfork ] ) is positive : @xmath60 since in the case at hand we have @xmath61 , the union of the above two ` stable ' regions , @xmath57 and @xmath62 , with the endpoints included , is simply @xmath63 .",
    "the second case is defined by inequality @xmath64 .",

    "however , it can have complex roots  provided @xmath67 .",
    "thus we arrive at a simple stability criterion for the flat nonzero solution @xmath68 , valid for all @xmath9 and @xmath3 : @xmath69 with @xmath70 as in ( [ eq : cpmroots ] ) .",
    "note that the stability threshold @xmath71 is always strictly positive .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the solution @xmath68 is always unstable in the case @xmath1 .",
    "( this fact has already been mentioned in the literature @xcite . ) therefore the ` focusing ' , or ` attractive ' , damped - driven schrdinger equation ( eq.([eq : ddcgle ] ) with @xmath1 ) does not have stable flat backgrounds except the trivial one , @xmath72 .",
    "the analysis of localised solutions over flat _ nonzero _",
    "backgrounds becomes meaningful only within the full ginzburg - landau equation , i.e. eq.([eq : ddcgle ] ) with positive @xmath0 .",
    "no less important is the question of when a flat solution can serve as an asymptotic value to a localised waveform  in other words , when is spatial decay to the flat solution possible . to find the corresponding criterion",
    ", we set @xmath73 in equation ( [ eq : dispersioneqn ] ) .",
    "this results in a quadratic equation @xmath74 where @xmath75 . the spatial decay to a flat background is possible unless both roots of eq.([eq : squad ] ) , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , are positive .    in the case of the @xmath46 background ,",
    "the discriminant of equation ( [ eq : squad ] ) is positive while the constant term is negative , whence @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , the decay to @xmath46 may occur for all values of @xmath9 , @xmath78 and @xmath0 .",
    "( this fact is of little importance , however , since we have just shown that this background is always unstable . )    in the case of the @xmath68 solution , we _ may _ have two positive roots  provided @xmath79 and @xmath80 , with @xmath81 as in ( [ c0 ] ) .",
    "following the steps in the previous subsection , one can readily show that this situation occurs only if @xmath82 , with @xmath70 as in ( [ eq : cpmroots ] ) .",
    "thus the _ stable _ constant solutions , defined by inequality ( [ flat_stab ] ) , can always serve as backgrounds to fronts and pulses .",
    "we will come across localised solutions over nonvanishing backgrounds in section [ sec : continuation ] below .    finally , to examine the case of the zero background , we set both @xmath83 and @xmath73 in equation ( [ eq : dispersioneqn ] ) .",
    "this yields @xmath84 where , as before , @xmath75 .",
    "since the middle term in ( [ zero_decay ] ) has a positive coefficient , we have @xmath85 , which means that the situation where both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are positive , can never occur in this case .",

    "fortunately , the operator @xmath149 does have a zero eigenvalue , and therefore @xmath146 can be a nonzero multiple of the corresponding eigenfunction ( which is @xmath150 . )",

    ". therefore we have two positive roots provided the discriminant @xmath179 is nonnegative , and , at the same time , the inequality @xmath180 holds true . in ( [ eq : ada - realaa ] ) we have introduced @xmath181 where the @xmath121 corresponds to @xmath182 and @xmath122 to @xmath183 .",

    "therefore the branch becomes ( neutrally ) stable sufficiently ` high up ' in @xmath241 in fig.[biffy ] ( i.e. for sufficiently long plateaus . )    despite the fact that negative values of the diffusivity @xmath0 are not physically meaningful , we did continue to @xmath229  in the hope that the resulting branch would reach a turning point and then return to the positive @xmath0-semiaxis ( which it did indeed do ) . the resulting branch is also shown in fig.[biffy ] .",
    "as we move into the region @xmath229 , the @xmath19 solution gradually develops into a three - humped state and when the curve returns to @xmath1 , we have a complex of the @xmath244 type , with a large separation between the individual solitons .",
    "( this complex of three solitons of the parametrically driven nonlinear schrdinger equation was previously found in ref.@xcite . ) crossing into the @xmath94 region , the central @xmath19 soliton in the complex transforms as if it did not have the @xmath20 solitons attached to its flanks . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath94-portion of the corresponding @xmath245 curve has virtually the same shape as the curve resulting from the continuation of @xmath19 to the region @xmath94 ; the only difference is that the curve emanating out of @xmath244 is shifted upwards relative to the curve emanating out of @xmath19 .",
    "similarly to the continuation of @xmath19 , the continuation of @xmath244 goes via a series of turning points , with each pass of the turning point resulting in the creation of another hump in the middle of the central region which becomes a long plateau .",
    "the lateral @xmath20 solitons are not affected by this process .",
    "the linearised spectrum is the union of the spectrum of the long pulse described in the previous paragraph and spectra of two @xmath20 solitons .",
    "in particular , it includes two positive real eigenvalues contributed by the @xmath20 s and so the entire branch resulting from the continuation of @xmath244 is unstable .",
    "we disregard it in what follows .",
    "the plateau arising in the final stage of continuation of the two branches shown in fig.[biffy ] , is nothing but an interval on the @xmath98-axis where @xmath18 equals @xmath68 , the flat nonzero solution given by eq.([flat_back ] ) .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath0 , @xmath246 , falls within the region @xmath63 where the background @xmath68 is stable . here",
    "@xmath247 is given by eq.([eq : cpmroots ] ) ; in particular , @xmath248 . in the language of phase transitions , the long pulse shown in fig.[conti](c ) can be seen as a  bubble \" of one stable phase in another one .",
    "the long pulse can also be interpreted as a bound state of two fronts interpolating between different stable backgrounds , @xmath72 and @xmath52 .",
    "this intuitively - appealing idea can be put on the quantitative footing by considering the spatial decay of perturbations to the flat background @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , consider the turning point separating the second stable branch from the first unstable branch in fig.[biffy ] .",
    "( this is a point with coordinates @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "note that we are only considering branches obtained by the continuation of the soliton @xmath19 to positive @xmath0 .",
    "branches obtained by the continuation of @xmath20 to negative @xmath0 first , are disregarded here . )",
    "it is at this point that the modulus squared of @xmath251 becomes double - humped ; before that , that is on the branch that leads to this point ( the first unstable branch ) , the function @xmath252 remained single - humped despite the double - humped imaginary part . letting @xmath228 , @xmath253 and @xmath249 we check that @xmath64 and hence , according to section [ spatially_uniform ] ,",
    "the quadratic ( [ inequalityfork ] ) , ( [ eq : squad ] ) has two complex roots , @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "therefore the wavenumber @xmath39 is complex as well : @xmath256 . solving equation ( [ eq : squad ] ) for @xmath41 we obtain , subsequently , @xmath257 ( we have chosen positive values for @xmath258 and @xmath259 here . )    for @xmath0 near the turning point in question",
    ", the plateau has not yet formed between the two humps and so they can be crudely thought of as two overlapping nls - like solitons with oscillations on their adjacent ( i.e. partner - facing ) tails .",
    "the bound state arises when one solitary wave is trapped in the potential well formed by the oscillatory tail of its partner . making use of the potential of interaction of two attractive nls solitons @xcite , @xmath260 ( where @xmath261 stands for the distance between the two humps ) , and taking into account that @xmath262 , we obtain a rough estimate for the separation : @xmath263 .",
    "this formula could also be derived from purely qualitative considerations ; all one needs to notice is that the absolute value of the field @xmath18 obtained from the linear superposition of two in - phase solitons is maximised ( and so the energy is minimised ) by placing one soliton at the first maximum of @xmath264 on the tail of its partner .",
    "substituting @xmath258 from ( [ kk ] ) , the approximate formula gives @xmath265 .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the numerically found value @xmath266 .    moving further along the ( second stable ) branch",
    ", the plateau appears and the two humps can no longer be approximated by the nls - like solitons .",
    "this makes the above estimate invalid .",
    "the solution can still be regarded as a bound state of two fronts but this time , in order to calculate the characteristic width of the pulse one would need to know the full profile of the front .",
    "we conjecture that for a given @xmath9 and @xmath3 , a free - standing stationary front exists just for a single value of @xmath0 , namely @xmath267 .",
    "( we are planning to verify this conjecture in future publications . ) on the other hand , stable and unstable bound states of fronts exist in a finite interval of @xmath0 values containing @xmath267 as an internal point .",
    "it is fitting to note here that similar pulse - to - front transformations occur also in the other system featuring the subcritical bifurcation , viz . the cubic - quintic ginzburg - landau equation with internal gain @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section , there is a certain discrepancy between the adiabatic analysis and numerical continuation .",
    "numerically , the @xmath268 soliton was found to be continuable all the way to @xmath269 whereas the adiabatic approach predicted the existence of a turning point at @xmath270 , where the @xmath268 should have merged with the @xmath271 branch . as for the @xmath19 solution",
    ", we found that it turns into a pulse with the double - humped imaginary part ( and not into the @xmath268 branch as suggested by the adiabatic approximation . ) in order to shed some light on the possible source of the discrepancy we performed the numerical continuation of the pulse @xmath268 in @xmath9 , for several fixed values of @xmath0 . here , by the @xmath268 we mean the pulse solution which results from the continuation of the schrdinger @xmath268 soliton to positive @xmath0 , for some fixed large value of @xmath9 ( in our case for @xmath272 . )",
    "having obtained this starting - point solution for several values of @xmath0 , we then continued it in @xmath9 , from @xmath272 to smaller @xmath9 .",
    "the stability of the arising solutions was examined by computing eigenvalues of the operator ( [ ev_problem ] ) at sample values of @xmath9 .    in each case",
    "considered , the @xmath268 branch was found to turn into the @xmath271 solution as @xmath9 reached the threshold value @xmath273 .",
    "( that is , for @xmath274 there are two branches of solutions whereas for @xmath275 , there is none ; see fig.[conti_in_h](a ) ) .",
    "the entire @xmath20 branch is unstable ; the single positive real eigenvalue moves to the negative semiaxis as the branch is continued past the turning point .",
    "continuing the arising @xmath271 branch to larger @xmath9 , we reach another turning point at @xmath276 , where the @xmath271 solution transforms into a pulse with the double - humped imaginary part .",
    "the values @xmath277 and @xmath278 are shown in fig.[conti_in_h](b ) , as functions of @xmath0 ( for the fixed @xmath279 ) .",
    "as @xmath280 , the difference @xmath281 decreases but remains nonzero .",
    "we verified this by computing @xmath277 and @xmath278 for equation ( [ c_infty ] ) which pertains to @xmath12 . in the same plot",
    "we display the function ( [ threshold ] ) which gives the adiabatic approximation to the curve @xmath282 .",
    "( note that for small @xmath0 , there is a good agreement between numerical and approximate values but as @xmath0 grows , the two curves diverge . )    continuing the @xmath271 branch past the second turning point , the solution adds another hump in the middle of the pulse , turns back again , adds another one , and so on .",
    "( see fig.[conti_in_h](a ) ) .",
    "a long plateau developes in the middle of the pulse , just like when it was continued in @xmath0 .",
    "similarly to the @xmath0-continuation , the turning points on the @xmath9-axis separate regions of stability from regions of instability , with the instability being caused by a single positive real eigenvalue ( which moves through @xmath283 at the turning points . )    from figure [ conti_in_h](b ) it is clear why the saddle - node bifurcation point where the @xmath271 and @xmath268 solutions would merge , did not appear in fig.[biffy ] .",
    "the reason is that fig.[biffy ] was plotted for a relatively large value of @xmath9 @xmath284 whereas according to fig.[conti_in_h](b ) , a horisontal line @xmath285 with @xmath286 can have no intersections with the saddle - node curve @xmath287 .",
    "( here all the numbers are for @xmath279 . ) the same fig.[conti_in_h](b ) explains what semed to be a discrepancy between the adiabatic analysis and the numerical continuation of the soliton @xmath20 in @xmath0 . the numerical result that seemed to contradict",
    "the adiabatics was that for @xmath228 , @xmath20 could be continued without bounds .",
    "it is now obvious from fig.[conti_in_h](b ) that the unbounded continuation is only possible for @xmath9 greater than @xmath288 .",
    "continuing the @xmath268 soliton to positive @xmath0 for @xmath9 _ smaller _ than @xmath288 , the branch turns back ( already as the @xmath271 pulse ) after hitting the lower solid curve in fig.[conti_in_h](b ) .",
    "therefore , the pattern arising for @xmath9 close to @xmath3 actually _ is _ in qualitative agreement with the adiabatic analysis , which was expected to be valid precisely for small @xmath0 or , equivalently , for small @xmath289 differences .",
    "in this paper we studied a cubic complex ginzburg - landau equation in which linear losses and diffusion are compensated by the linear parametric drive .",
    "the nonlinear term in the equation was taken to be purely conservative .",
    "there are three stationary homogeneous solutions to equation ( [ eq : ddcgle ] ) , and we have shown that the @xmath72 solution is stable if @xmath290 , as long as @xmath29 .",
    "this stability condition coincides with the corresponding condition for the nonlinear schrdinger case ( i.e. for @xmath1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the stability properties of the _ nonzero _ homogeneous solutions are not the same as in the @xmath1 case . indeed , unlike for @xmath1",
    ", there is a stable flat _",
    "solution @xmath52 for sufficiently large diffusion coefficients , @xmath291 .    having established the persistence of the nls solitons @xmath19 and @xmath20 for small nonzero @xmath0 , we continued them in @xmath0 numerically .",
    "the continuation of the soliton @xmath19 yields a sequence of pulse - like solutions , separated by turning points , with increasing number of humps .",
    "the stability of these solutions changes at each turning point , so that stable multihump solutions coexist with unstable ones .",
    "it is fitting to note here that the multistability of multipulse solutions is _ not _ observed in the schrdinger limit where only the two - soliton complex was found to be stable @xcite . as @xmath292 , where @xmath293 , the solution takes the form of a long plateau ( an interval of the stable background @xmath68 ) sandwiched between two fronts .",
    "we also performed the continuation in @xmath9 , for the fixed @xmath0 . for each @xmath94 ,",
    "two localised solutions are born in a saddle - node bifurcation as @xmath9 exceeds a threshold value .",
    "( we obtained an analytic formula for the threshold in the adiabatic approximation ; it is in agreement with the numerical results for small @xmath0 . )",
    "the subsequent continuation gives rise to a sequence of coexisting stable multihump solutions culminating in a bound state of two widely separated fronts .",
    "solitary pulses in the form of long shelves ( plateaus ) can allow easy experimental observation in physical systems described by our model .",
    "in particular , they may be employed as a natural basis for the non - return - to - zero ( nrz ) format of the data transmission in optical telecommunications . in the nrz format , the 1 and 0 bits are coded , respectively , by sending or withholding the signal within a standard time slot .",
    "a string of several 1 s looks as a long uniform pulse of an essentially arbitrary length .",
    "the stability of such pulses is crucial to maintain the fixed shape of the long array of 1 s , and to prevent the _ inter - symbol interference _ ,",
    "i.e. , the blurring of empty intervals between such strings , which represent ( strings of ) 0 s ( see , e.g. ref . @xcite and references therein . ) in the case of lasers , which can also be described by the present model @xcite , the possibility of the generation of stable long pulses of arbitrary duration , i.e. , an effective _ tunability _ of the output , is an essential advantage too .",
