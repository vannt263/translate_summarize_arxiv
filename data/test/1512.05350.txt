    "while accretion of gas onto compact objects has been studied for over fifty years , much uncertain remains about how angular momentum is transported .",
    "there is increasing evidence that the interplay between the local angular momentum transport from magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence and the more global accretion flow shapes the behavior of the mass accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to connect mhd accretion disk theory with one of the most widely discussed phenomenological models for disk variability , the propagating fluctuations model . we explore how a stochastically varying effective viscosity leads to the growth of so - called ",
    "propagating fluctuations \" in our long , global accretion disk simulation and relate the behavior of our simulation to observable properties from accreting black holes .",
    "the idealized @xmath1-disk from the seminal work of has long served as the canonical disk model .",
    "assuming turbulence was present in the disk , they argued that an effective kinematic viscosity originating from turbulent eddies spanning a radial range provided the internal viscous stress required to transport angular momentum and allow for accretion . in their model , the turbulent viscosity takes the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the turbulent velocity and @xmath4 is a characteristic length scale of the turbulent eddies .",
    "this viscosity can be parameterized with an  efficiency \" factor in terms of the local sound speed , @xmath5 , and the local scale height of the disk , h , @xmath6 . with this prescription , restrict the @xmath1 parameter to a range of @xmath7 .",
    "if the turbulent velocity is greater than the sound speed , the gas will shock , convert excess kinetic energy to thermal energy , and return to the subsonic domain , ensuring @xmath8 .",
    "likewise , they postulated @xmath9 because the differential shear in the disk will quickly break - up large turbulent eddies leading to localized turbulence .",
    "an alternative but equivalent view , motivated by dimensional analysis , is to say that the relevant viscous stresses in the disk are proportional to the pressure , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the off - diagonal component of the stress energy tensor and @xmath12 is pressure . @xmath1 and @xmath13 are related to each other by a factor of order unity that depends upon the equation of state .    even in the early work of",
    ", the influence of magnetic stress was intuitively assumed to be an essential part of the turbulent injection mechanism , though a viable driving mechanism was absent until the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) was put forth as a candidate to drive the disk turbulence .",
    "the instability of a differentially rotating , magnetized plasma was originally discovered by @xcite and @xcite , but its astrophysical significance was not realized until @xcite studied it in the context of an ionized accretion disk .",
    "they showed that radial perturbations of gas elements are linearly unstable if @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the wavenumber , @xmath16 is the alfvn speed , and @xmath17 is the orbital angular frequency . as a fluid element",
    "is perturbed , the displacement acts to enhance a weak seed field until it goes nonlinear , which subsequent numerical mhd simulations have verified drives and sustains turbulence @xcite . to date , a large and rich body of simulation work has been dedicated to studying how mri driven turbulence behaves and transports angular momentum including studies using unstratified shearing boxes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the viscous behavior of the disk ultimately arises because of net internal stress due to correlated fluctuations in the magnetic field and correlated fluctuations in gas velocity @xcite .",
    "these correlated fluctuations lead to the maxwell stress ( @xmath18 ) and the reynolds stress ( @xmath19 ) , respectively . following the @xmath1-prescription ,",
    "the effective @xmath1 from the net stress is thus the ratio of the volume averaged stress to the volume averaged pressure , @xmath20 this serves to parameterize the effectiveness of angular momentum loss by the stresses acting on the gas in the disk . in this paper",
    "we use angled brackets to denote a volume average for a given quantity , @xmath21 , where @xmath22    turbulent fluctuations in the disk will naturally lead to stochastic variability in the effective @xmath1 and provide an intuitive explanation for the existence of broadband photometric variability observed in both galactic black hole binaries ( gbhbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the photometric variability is observed across several decades in frequency , typically in the form of aperiodic  flicker \" type noise .",
    "employing a stochastic @xmath1 , @xcite developed a model for this flicker noise by linearizing the standard geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk evolution equations .",
    "the model was limited to small perturbations in @xmath1 , but it reproduced the power spectrum of the fluctuations and laid the foundation for the subsequent development of the propagating fluctuations model .",
    "the propagating fluctuations model has since taken a more generalized form and served as a phenomenological description for the structure and organization of the broadband variability for gbhbs and agns .",
    "the evolution of a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk ( in units where @xmath23 ) is governed by a nonlinear diffusion equation @xmath24\\ ] ] where r is the distance from the central engine , @xmath25 is the local effective viscosity in the disk , and @xmath26 is the local surface density . in this equation ,",
    "the diffusive redistribution of angular momentum depends on the product of the effective viscosity and the local surface density .",
    "if the effective viscosity fluctuates , the instantaneous mass accretion rate ( @xmath27 ) at each point in the disk is thus the product of the many prior stochastic events .",
    "a consequence of the multiplicative combination is that fluctuations in @xmath27 will tend to be preserved as they accrete as higher density regions will typically have higher @xmath27 and lower density regions will typically have lower @xmath27 . additionally ,",
    "since the viscous time increases with radii , higher frequency fluctuations will be imposed on the accretion flow as material moves inwards .",
    "this will lead to the development of a hierarchical structure in the fluctuations with the smaller , high frequency fluctuations imposed upon the larger , low frequency fluctuations .",
    "the appeal of the propagating fluctuations model is that it explains three properties of black hole variability that have been difficult to reproduce with other variability models .",
    "first , gbhb and agn light curves are log - normally distributed @xcite which is accounted for through the multiplicative combination of many independent fluctutations .",
    "second , and related to the log - normal distribution , the root - mean square ( rms ) of the flux variability in the light curves of both gbhbs and agns depends linearly on the flux level @xcite , the so - called rms - flux relationship .",
    "this indicates the mass accretion rate variation has a constant fractional amplitude and that the mechanism driving variability is , therefore , independent of the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "finally , coherent fluctuations in the emission at different wavebands from gbhbs have frequency dependent time lags with variability in higher energy bands lagging variability in lower energy bands @xcite . this  hard lag \" is believed to be a signature of fluctuations in the accretion flow moving to smaller radii in the disk where the emission temperature is higher .    despite the success the propagating fluctuations model has had in explaining the phenomenology of gbhb and agn variability , the model has yet to be examined in the context of modern mhd theory . to date",
    ", the model has been examined in the context of geometrically - thin ( vertically - integrated ) @xmath1-disks in which some stochasticity is imposed upon @xmath1 .",
    "how well this viscous behavior translates into an mhd disk is unknown .",
    "a particularly challenge is the timescales on which @xmath1 fluctuates and drives variability within the accretion flow .",
    "@xcite prescribes @xmath1 fluctuations to be slow , of order the viscous time .",
    "however , if fluctuations in @xmath1 are solely due to turbulent fluctuations , we might expect them to be on the dynamical timescale .",
    "@xcite show , using a semi - analytic model , that propagating fluctuations only exist if fluctuations in @xmath1 occur at sufficiently low frequencies .",
    "if the frequency of @xmath1 fluctuations is too high , they find that @xmath27 fluctuations are damped out and the nonlinear features of the variability do not develop .",
    "therefore , fluctuations in the effective-@xmath1 on timescales longer than the dynamical timescale are needed to reproduce the phenomenology seen in the variability .    in this paper ,",
    "we perform the first detailed analysis of propagating fluctuations in the context of a long - duration , mhd accretion disk simulation .",
    "we show that the well - known quasi - periodic dynamo induces slow fluctuations in the effective @xmath1 that then drive propagating fluctuations . in section [ sec - model_conv ]",
    "we introduce the simulation and perform a convergence study .",
    "section [ sec - overview ] presents a brief discussion of the nature of the turbulence . in section [ sec - dynamo ] , we investigate the relationship of the quasi - periodic disk dynamo and angular momentum transport , finding that it imposes an intermediate - timescale modulation of the effective @xmath1 .",
    "we then examine the variability of both the mass accretion rate ( section [ sec - prop_flucs ] ) and a proxy for bolometric radiative luminosity ( section [ sec - proxy_emission ] ) finding that both quantities display the non - linear variability characteristics of real sources and that the coherence of these quantities across the disk is exactly as expected in the propagating fluctuations picture . in section [ sec - discussion ] , we place our results into a broader context , and then conclude in section [ sec - summary ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the construction and convergence properties of our numerical model . in brief , we evolve a three - dimensional ideal mhd simulation in order to study the local and global dynamics of a geometrically - thin ( constant opening angle @xmath28 ) accretion disk . given our focus on the time - variability of the accretion flow , the crux of our problem is the description of the mhd turbulent dynamics and how it influences the long - timescale behavior of the disk .",
    "thus , we concentrate our computational resources into the high - spatial resolution and the long duration nature of the simulation . we demonstrate below that the numerical grid is of high enough resolution that the macroscopic behavior of the disk turbulence is converged and insensitive to increases in resolution . as a penalty ,",
    "we simplify the physics to the bare minimum .",
    "we employ non - relativistic ideal mhd , and a pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential to emulate the dynamical effects of a general relativistic potential , including the presence of an inner - most circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "we use a simple cooling function to keep the disk thin , but otherwise neglect all radiation physics .",
    "renderings of density and magnetic turbulent structure of our fiducial disk simulation are shown in figure [ fig - diskimg ] .",

    "the explicit integration time step is set by the usual courant conditions , and is first - order accurate in time .",
    "we begin by defining our fiducial simulation .",
    "the simulation domain is covered by spherical coordinates ( @xmath34 ) and spans @xmath35 , \\theta \\in [ \\pi/2 -0.5,\\pi/2 + 0.5 ] , \\phi \\in [ 0,\\pi/3)$ ] , shown in figure [ fig - diskimg ] .",
    "the zone aspect ratio is approximately @xmath36 and each scale height is resolved with @xmath37-zones .",

    "we modified the standard zeus - mp boundaries to conserve @xmath41 across the @xmath42- and @xmath43-boundaries .",
    "the simulation domain was broken into a well - resolved inner region ( @xmath44 ) , used for our analysis , and an outer region with poorer resolution to act as a gas reservoir .",
    "the gas reservoir mitigates the effect of secular decay from the draining of material from the disk over the course of the simulation .",
    "the radial spacing in the inner region logarithmically increases in r from 4 - 45 r@xmath45 . in all , the simulation has @xmath46 zones in this region .",
    "the @xmath47 spacing in the outer region logarithmically increases from @xmath48 and a total of @xmath49 zones in this region .",
    "we approximate the gravitational field around a nonrotating black hole with a psuedo - newtonian gravitational potential of the form : @xmath50 with this potential , several important aspects of a general relativistic gravity field are captured including an isco ( at @xmath51 ) and the qualitative change of radial shear in the disk .",
    "a @xmath52 adiabatic equation of state is used for the gas .",

    "the cooling function plays the role of the real physical processes and removes energy at a rate equivalent to the thermal time of the disk ( @xmath56 ) , as was done in @xcite .",

    "a protection routine is implemented to ensure the density and pressure values do not become artificially small and/or negative .",
    "the gas was initialized with a purely azimuthal velocity field and a weak magnetic field .",
    "the local velocity is set so that the effective centripetal force balances the gravitational force . a series of weak , large - scale poloidal magnetic field loops are set for the initial magnetic field configuration ( e.g. @xcite ) to perturb the disk and allow for the growth of the mri .",
    "the loops were set from the vector potential @xmath62 to ensure the initial field was divergence free and had the form : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a normalization constant , @xmath65 is an envelope function that is 1 in the body of the disk and smoothly goes to 0 at @xmath66 and 3 scale heights above the disk .",

    "the values of @xmath69 , @xmath74 , @xmath70 , and @xmath75 were output every two isco orbits ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the issue of convergence is forefront when considering the reliability of results from any _ ab initio _ accretion disk simulation because the mhd turbulence that mediates angular momentum transport has structure on the smallest accessible scales . with this type of simulation",
    ", the macroscopic behavior can have a resolution dependence if the turbulent scales dominating the shear stresses are not adequately resolved @xcite . as a preface to our study of variability , here",
    "we assess the degree to which we are adequately resolving the turbulent dynamics using two measures .",
    "firstly , we examine the resolvability of the fastest growing linear mri mode through the commonly employed quality factors introduced by @xcite . secondly , to characterize the non - linear saturation of the turbulence , we use the magnetic tilt angle . using these diagnostics , we compare our fiducial ( long ) simulation with higher resolution comparison simulations .",
    "the first set of diagnostics used to measure resolvability were the vertical and azimuthal quality factors @xcite , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively . @xmath79 and @xmath80 measure resolvability through the number of grid cells per fastest - growing mri wavelength , @xmath81 , and critical toroidal field length , @xmath82 where @xmath83    using the quality factors , we characterized the global resolvability of the disk .",
    "the local values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 were calculated in every voxel of the well - resolved region ( @xmath84 ) for every data dump after the transient behavior in the disk had died away ( @xmath72 onwards ) .",
    "the volume - weighted average was calculated for each quality factor by averaging over in the region within one scale height above and below the disk mid - plane to get the instantaneous value and then over the entire duration of the simulation to get a temporal average .",
    "the averaging was restricted to the body of the disk because we want the most conservative estimate of the resolvability of the simulation . in the highly magnetized , low - density coronal regions the quality factors are very high and ,",
    "if included , the quality factors would appear artificially high , overestimating how well we resolve the mri .",
    "we find @xmath85 and @xmath86 , a bit below the nominal resolvability criteria of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the global averages , we are interested in how the resolvability depends on the position within the grid . shown in figure [ fig - qzqp ] is the time and azimuthally averaged profile of @xmath79 , as well as the time and polar average profile of @xmath80 .",
    "the average of @xmath79 was calculated as a function of @xmath88 and @xmath43 by averaging over entire @xmath40 domain .",
    "as we did in our global average , the vertical averaging over the polar angle in our calculation of @xmath80 is only done in the region within one scale height above and below the disk to exclude the coronal region .",

    "thus , we additionally measure the average in - plane magnetic tilt angle , @xmath118 the value of which is closely connected to the processes by which the mhd turbulence saturates @xcite .",
    "we note that , given the dominance of @xmath119 over the other field components , the tilt angle is approximately given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the maxwell stress normalized by the magnetic pressure , @xmath122 and @xmath123 is the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure , @xmath124 thus , the magnetic tilt angle is directly tied to the effectiveness of angular momentum transport at a given field strength and can be used to probe whether a given simulation has correctly captured the non - linear saturation of the mhd turbulence .",
    "we calculate @xmath125 within the mid - plane regions of the disk , restricting to half a scale height above and below the disk midplane in the well - resolved region .",
    "the temporally averaged magnetic tilt ( neglecting the first 200 isco orbits ) is @xmath126 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - mag_tilt ] ) , comparable to estimates from both analytic theory @xcite and previous high - resolution local @xcite and global @xcite simulations .",
    "we further assess the fidelity of our fiducial simulation by performing two additional high - resolution comparison runs .",
    "the first comparison simulation had the exact same geometry as the fiducial simulation , but twice the resolution in each of the three dimensions ( hence voxels of @xmath127 the volume ) .",
    "the second comparison simulation also doubles the number of zones in each of the three dimensions , but then extends the domain to include the full 2@xmath110 in azimuth .",
    "both of these comparison simulations possess @xmath128 total zones with a vertical resolution of @xmath129-zones per disk scale - height .",
    "of course , the @xmath130 ratio was larger in the @xmath111 higher resolution simulation due to the extension of the @xmath40 domain .",
    "the evolution of @xmath125 for the simulation used in our analysis and the two test simulations is shown in figure [ fig - mag_tilt ] .    in the higher resolution simulations",
    "the evolution of @xmath125 is slightly faster than our fiducial run , but settles at similar levels as the mri - driven turbulence saturates .",
    "one difference between the development of the turbulence in the comparison simulations and our fiducial run is that our fiducial run has a transient spike in magnetic tilt angle @xmath131 ( 94 isco orbits ) into the initialization . from visual inspection",
    ", we see the growth and break - up of a large channel flow in the disk body in the fiducial run .",
    "this does not develop in the higher resolution comparison simulations because the non - axisymmetric parasitic instabilities are more effective at breaking up nascent channel flows . with this minor difference ,",
    "the similarity in the evolution and saturation of the turbulence between the three simulations indicates that our fiducial run is adequately resolved .    , for long , fiducial disk simulation ( black line ) , high resolution wedge simulation ( red line ) , and high resolution @xmath111 simulation ( blue line ) .",
    "the t=0 time we set use in our analysis is marked by the black dashed line .",

    "the ( almost ) one - to - one correspondence of the rms to the average mass accretion rate is expected , as well as the intercept passing through the origin , i.e. when there is no flux there should be no variability .",
    "however , the observed rms - flux relationships are typically offset and best described by a model with a constant baseline flux , @xmath242 , that varies with black hole spectral state .",
    "our results suggest the variable component is related to the underlying mhd turbulence of the disk and the flux offset can be attributed to disk processes not captured by our simulation .",
    "we now discuss the global behavior of our emission proxy and how the propagating fluctuations in @xmath27 might appear as photometric variability .",
    "the full details of the radiation produced through the interaction of the accretion flow with the various emission mechanisms can only be captured by including more realistic radiation physics , which our simulation lacks .",
    "nevertheless , we can use our emission proxy to explore the emission variability in a broad sense .",
    "in particular , we want to determine if the structure of the @xmath27 variability can be easily observed when the emission is integrated over the entire disk .",
    "the flux we observe from gbhbs and agns is , in effect , the integrated emission from a range of radii that evolve on timescales proportional to their dynamical times .",

    "several aspects of the disk emission are apparent .",
    "first , the light curve is similar to the time trace of @xmath27 at the isco .",
    "the signal is aperiodic and flares in the light curve correspond to large accretion events .",
    "second , any flares in the light curve quickly decay down to a well - defined , stationary average .",
    "the property of mean - reversion is of statistical interest as a way to model its behavior . finally , and worth the most discussion , is the dominate role emission from the inner region plays in driving variability",
    "this is more clearly seen in the radial profile of the emission per unit area of the disk , but can also be inferred by the high - frequency flares . in figure",
    "[ fig - lc_plots ] the disk profile of is shown for comparison .",
    "the two profiles trace each other well at larger radii , but diverge in the innermost regions . in the canonical @xmath1-disk",
    "the energy flux goes to zero at the isco because it was believed at the time that no torques could be felt from the gas in the inner plunging region .",
    "mhd simulations have shown that , in fact , torques can be felt across the isco and radiation can originate from closer to the black hole than the isco @xcite .",
    "in addition to the physical effect of torques spanning the isco region , there may also be a nonphysical contribution to our profile because we assume any energy from stresses is immediately converted into radiated energy .",
    "in reality , there is a time delay between the injection and the dissipation as the energy is transported through the turbulent cascade . in the inner regions near the black hole",
    "the material could be rapidly swept into the hole before it has had time to completely radiate the injected energy .",
    "this would lead to an overestimation of the emission from the inner regions by our emission proxy due to this advection of energy .      in our analysis of the mass accretion rate in the simulation we found the variability of @xmath27 had near - identical structure to the universally observed flux variability from black hole systems .",

    "the skewness of this distribution is @xmath247 , indicating the histogram of the light curve is more highly skewed than the histogram of the @xmath27 and the log - normal distribution is more pronounced .",
    "naively , the increased skewness is surprising given that the light curve is integrated over the disk and presumably additively combining many random processes .",
    "according to the central limit theorem , this should drive the distribution to be more gaussian .",
    "however , since @xmath27 is radially coherent , the fluctuations of the emission proxy are not independent , as is assumed in a gaussian process .",
    "the full synthetic light curve also has a linear relationship between the rms of the variability and the average flux value .",
    "as we did with @xmath27 , the light curve was broken into 20 sections and the standard deviation and mean values were calculated for each .",
    "the distribution is well fit by a linear function with @xmath15 = @xmath248 and @xmath240 = @xmath249 .",
    "the rms - flux relationship of the synthetic emission is flatter than the linear relationship between the rms of @xmath27 and the average value .",
    "in fact , the slope of our linear fit is remarkably similar to those seen in gbhbs , specifically cyg x-1 and sax j1808.4 - 3658 @xcite . while it is tempting to make a direct comparison , the statistics on our measurement prevent drawing any deeper conclusions .",
    "however , given how much the difference in the slopes of the rms - flux relationship of @xmath27 compared to the rms - flux relationship of the light curve , it does appear that integrating over the disk plays a significant role . by integrating over the entire disk ,",
    "the low - frequency emission adds a slowly varying component to the flux , thereby decreasing the percentage of the flux from the fast varying inner regions and decreasing the slope .",
    "an examination of coherence requires us to create two light curves to imitate observation with two bands ( for instance hard and soft x - rays ) .",
    "we formed these light curves by integrating the emission proxy in the regions spanning @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "then , as we did with @xmath27 , the coherence function was calculated by dividing the light curves into three sections , resulting in the coherence function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - lc_diagnostics ] ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the coherence shows the same behavior as found for the mass accretion rate , with highly - coherent signals at low - frequencies , and a falling coherence at higher - frequencies .",
    "de - coherence is seen at @xmath252 which , while a relatively high - frequency , agrees with the coherence and phase plots of @xmath27 fluctuations with the isco in figure [ fig - coh_phase ] .",
    "having established the signatures of propagating fluctuations in @xmath27 are present in the variability of our emission proxy , we will now look at the psd and the statistical behavior of the variability by fitting a simple ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process .",
    "shown in figure [ fig - plaw_fit ] is the psd of the synthetic light curve fit with a broken power law .",
    "the last 512 data points of our light curve were used to calculate the psd which ensures no phase dependencies were present . following the method described in @xcite , the psd was fit with a power law plus white - noise component and broken power law plus white - noise component of the form @xmath253 where k is a normalization constant",
    ", @xmath254 is the low frequency slope , @xmath255 is the high frequency slope , and @xmath256 is the break frequency , to determine which model provides the best description of the psd .",
    "the power density was assumed to have an exponential probability distribution with the probability of measuring a given power between @xmath257 and @xmath258 expressed by , @xmath259 where p@xmath260 is the mean power . for an individual bin ,",
    "the likelihood of a measuring power @xmath261 is@xmath262 for the entire psd , the likelihood is the product of the individual likelihoods . since this can often be very large or very small , the standard statistic used is the log likelihood , @xmath263.\\ ] ] a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm was used to conduct the fitting and find the parameters that maximize the log likelihood of each psd model .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the psd is well fit by both a broken power law with @xmath264 , @xmath265 , and @xmath266 and a single power law with @xmath267 .",
    "however , the broken power law provides a much better statistical fit with @xmath268 at the expense of two degrees of freedom .",
    "this translates into a @xmath269 .",
    "hence , while the underlying psd of @xmath27 at the isco in our simulation has @xmath270 , the integrated emission proxy has a steeper psd . this is simply due to the integrated contributions from across the accretion disk , with additional low frequency power from large radii being added to the psd .",
    "it is not immediately clear what physics sets the break frequency @xmath256 , corresponding to a timescale of @xmath271 , although it approximately corresponds to the cooling / thermal timescale of the inner regions of the disk . in order to ensure that the low - frequency break is not imposed by the truncation of our emission proxy at @xmath272 , we generated light curves and the corresponding pdss truncating at @xmath273 . in all cases ,",
    "the break persisted and the frequency was unchanged .",
    "in addition to the psd , the statistical properties of the variability of the synthetic light curve are of interest and provide an additional method of characterizing the synthetic light curve .",
    "recent work has shown a damped random - walk , and more specifically an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process , provides a very good statistical model of gbhb and agn variability @xcite .",
    "the ou process is part of a class of statistical models called _ continuous time , first order autoregressive _ ,",
    "car(1 ) , processes .",
    "car(1 ) processes can take many forms and behave very different depending on their model parameters .",
    "the ou process describes a noisy relaxation process where a system is stochastically perturbed from a stationary mean and decays back to the mean with a relaxation time @xmath274 @xcite .",
    "the stochastic differential equation describing such a process is : @xmath275 where @xmath276 , @xmath198 is the mean and @xmath199 is a measure of the average magnitude of volatility per @xmath277 .",
    "this equation has the following direct solution : @xmath278 where @xmath279 is the time step and @xmath280 is a zero - centered , gaussian distribution with a variance of 1 .",
    "the even sampling of our light curve provides some simplicity in fitting the ou process .",
    "@xmath281 is linearly dependent on @xmath282 and takes the form : @xmath283 where @xmath284 is a normal - random term that is independent and identically distributed . from a simple linear fit , we can solve for @xmath285 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 where @xmath286 @xmath287 @xmath288    since the ou process is inherently a gaussian process we must therefore perform the fit to the synthetic light curve in log - space since our  flux \" distribution is log - normally distributed .",
    "thinking in terms of real observations , this is equivalent to fitting in magnitude space . for our light curve ,",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath289 , @xmath290 and @xmath291 .",
    "the @xmath285 parameter corresponds to a decay time of @xmath292 .",
    "in our simulation we find that @xcite type  propagating fluctuations \" quickly develop and are sustained throughout the entire simulation . the multiplicative manner by which fluctuations in @xmath27 combine and grow defines the behavior and subsequent evolution of the disk .",
    "the most significant consequence from the multiplicative combination of @xmath27 fluctuations is that the accretion history of a given parcel of gas is retained , allowing for the apparent propagation of fluctuations on a viscous time . the @xmath27 variability at the isco in our simulation bears striking resemblance to variability observed from astrophysical black holes and shares the same phenomenological properties . in particular",
    ", it reproduces the log - normal flux distributions , rms - flux relationship , and radial coherence ubiquitously observed from gbhbs and agns .",
    "these nonlinear features have typically been difficult for variability models to account for , but are a consequence of a scenario where the mass accretion rate is proportional to the multiplicative product of a stochastically varying viscosity and the local surface density . in our simulated disk",
    "they develop naturally from the mri driven turbulence .",
    "additionally , we use an emission proxy to generate a disk - integrated synthetic light curve to verify that the nonlinear characteristics of the @xmath27 variability will actually translate into observable features in the disk emission . while rudimentary , our emission proxy follows the turbulent energy injected to the gas , which we assume",
    "is quickly radiated away since we are considering a radiatively efficient disk .",
    "we find that , indeed , the nonlinear features of @xmath27 are present when the entire disk integrated emission is considered and are not lost with the addition of low - frequency variability originating from gas at large radii .",
    "our work was able to address several issues raised by @xcite regarding the timescale on which the effective @xmath1 parameter of the disk fluctuates and how well an mhd disk can really be described by a strictly viscous disk on long time scales .",
    "the previous efforts to model propagating fluctuations in mass accretion rate of @xcite using a linearized model and @xcite using a one dimensional viscous disk model relied on the _ a priori _ assumption that the low - frequency fluctuations in effective @xmath1 occurred on a viscous time . however , this is very long for the magnetic field to vary .",
    "when @xcite allowed @xmath1 to vary on a dynamical time , the typically assumed evolutionary timescale for the mri , they found that the fluctuations were too rapid and propagating fluctuations did not develop .",
    "we find the disk dynamo can provide the necessary intermediate timescale modulation of the effective @xmath1 to drive propagating fluctuations in mass accretion rate .",
    "dynamo action is universally observed in modern accretion disk simulations and seems to be intimately tied to the mhd physics of a differentially rotating plasma .",
    "thus , the dynamo can provide a natural mechanism to introduce variability in the effective @xmath1 .",
    "while the ubiquity of the dynamo has been established , its presence is typically neglected when considering accretion disk evolution .",
    "our results highlight the significant impact the dynamo can have on the disk and that it is a fundamental ingredient in the driving of propagating fluctuations .",
    "the properties of the @xmath27 and light curve variability from our global , _ ab initio _ mhd simulation are very similar to those from the simple viscous disk with stochastic viscosity parameter of @xcite . from this similarity",
    ", we can conclude that on long timescales our mhd disk acts in a viscous manner .",
    "this is not surprising , but there is not a trivial connection between the internal mhd stresses that transport angular momentum and the expected viscous behavior of the disk , even though it has largely been intuited from empirical results .",
    "our mhd simulation captures gross aspects of real disk variability , but it is not without limitations . in particular , we use simple prescriptions to approximate the affects of general relativity and radiative physics . as a first effort at modeling propagating fluctuations in mass accretion rate in an mhd disk",
    "we are mainly concerned with capturing the dynamics of the disk and the interplay of the accretion flow with the stochastically fluctuating effective @xmath1 . to do this , a long",
    ", high - resolution simulation is required .",
    "therefore , the priority of where computational resources are used shifts away from more complex physics and into the duration and resolution of the simulation .",
    "while the focus of our analysis has been on understanding the signatures of propagating fluctuations around black holes , we do not expect the effects of general relativity and radiation physics to have a significant impact on the characteristics of the disk evolution are primarily concerned with .",
    "in fact , the phenomenology we seek to understand is also readily observed in cataclysmic variable ( cv ) systems @xcite .",
    "these systems are non - relativistic and not hot enough to be largely affected by radiation pressure in the disk .",
    "the similarity of the broad - band variability between cvs , gbhbs , and agns implies that propagating fluctuations are a generic feature of highly ionized accretion disks .",
    "the fluctuations resulting from the underlying accretion processes behave consistently across many orders of magnitude of mass , temperature and evolutionary time implying that the growth of propagating fluctuations is not unique to an specific class of system , but rather intrinsically tied to the angular momentum transport resulting from mhd turbulence .",
    "therefore , we believe that the results from this simulation are robust enough to provide a qualitative description the accretion mechanism for highly ionized accretion disks .",
    "we have performed the first examination of the propagating fluctuation picture using _ ab initio _ mhd turbulent models of disk accretion .",
    "the propagating fluctuations model has served to explain the universally observed nonlinear features of photometric variability from accreting black holes of all masses . in our simulation , propagating fluctuations in @xmath27 form and behave in a manner consistent with those of the viscous disk model of @xcite .",
    "our main results are summarized here :    1 .",
    "the effective @xmath1-parameter in our simulated disk is highly variable .",
    "the variability has two components : a high - frequency component due to local fluctuations from the mri and a lower frequency component due to modulation of the stress by the disk dynamo .",
    "the lower frequency variability in the effective @xmath1-parameter from the disk dynamo drives fluctuations in @xmath27 by modulating the internal disk stress on an intermediate timescale .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , if fluctuations in @xmath1 are too rapid , fluctuations will be damped out and propagating fluctuations will not grow . the dynamo frequency is low enough that propagating fluctuations can easily grow .",
    "previous efforts directed at understanding the role of propagating fluctuations in @xmath27 relied on _ ad hoc _ prescriptions for the variability timescale .",
    "we show , for the first time , that the dynamo fills this role and provides a natural driver for fluctuations in @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath27 in our simulation is positively correlated with @xmath193 and the effective @xmath1 . in the analytic disk equations",
    "the mass accretion rate is proportional to the product of the local surface density and the local viscosity .",
    "these correlations occur in our _ ab initio _ simulation , suggesting that they naturally result from the interaction of the mri with accretion flow .",
    "the @xmath27 variability at the isco of our simulation resembles the photometric variability observed from gbhbs and agns .",
    "the @xmath27 variability is log - normally distributed , has a linear rms - flux relationship , and displays radial coherence .",
    "these features are empirically observed and have been attributed to propagating fluctuations in @xmath27 .",
    "we find that they are , in fact , properties of accretion flow when propagating fluctuations in @xmath27 are present .",
    "5 .   using an emission proxy to generate a disk integrated , synthetic light curve , we find that the qualitative properties of the accretion flow are reflected in the observable emission .",
    "while the nonlinear signatures are preserved in the light curve , integrating over the disk adds additional low - frequency power from more distant radii .",
    "however , since inner region of the disk is brightest , the high frequency variability is preferentially weighted and the nonlinear properties of @xmath27 are preserved .",
