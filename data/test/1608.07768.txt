    "after the discovery of the higgs boson by the atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc @xcite , the particle content of standard model ( sm ) is complete .",
    "searches for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) are currently on - going .",
    "several anomalies observed in semi - leptonic decays of b mesons @xcite could be better understood with the existence of a heavy resonance decaying predominantly to photons @xcite .",
    "many bsm theories predict the existence of heavy neutral resonances , which could be produced in @xmath6 collisions .",
    "several flavors of two higgs doublet ( 2hdm ) , composite higgs , singlet higgs and other models can accommodate such particles primarily being detected through their decays into photon pairs .",
    "such a resonance could have its couplings to @xmath3 and @xmath2 significantly suppressed compared to @xmath4 .",
    "the couplings to a @xmath7 pair may be further suppressed or absent . in the proposed models ,",
    "the new particle may have cp - even , cp - odd or cp - mixed parity .",
    "these properties lead to important consequences related to the possible production mechanism of such a hypothetical resonance .",
    "the investigation of production mechanism may thus help to reveal the exact nature of such a particle .",
    "in this paper we present a study of the properties of a new heavy neutral particle which could be discovered in high energy @xmath6 collisions .",
    "we concentrate on the class of models where the di - photon decays of such a particle will be the first decay mode to be observed experimentally .",
    "we further assume that this new hypothetical particle has spin @xmath8 . in case of observation of a heavy di - photon resonance",
    ", its spin-0 nature can be quickly investigated by studying the distribution of its production angle @xmath9 , as suggested in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the spin-0 scenario , investigating cp - even , cp - odd and cp - mixed assumptions of parity by studying jet distributions from the production vertex of this resonance . based on this model",
    ", we outline the experimental observables to be investigated to understand its exact nature .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : models ] provides a brief review of most relevant physics models capable of accommodating such a resonance . in section  [ sec : vbf ] the corresponding modifications to the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) production mechanism are discussed . in section  [ sec : fs ] the characteristic jet distributions of such production are presented .",
    "the prospects for study is the exact nature of such a particle using these distributions are presented in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "production in @xmath6 collisions of a heavy neutral spin-0 resonance ( we designate it as @xmath10 ) primarily detectable through its decay into pairs of photons corresponds to a relatively large class of theoretical models .",
    "such resonances are predicted in certain flavors of two higgs doublet ( 2hdm ) , composite higgs models @xcite and scalar singlet models where @xmath11 couples to new vector - like quarks via a yukawa coupling ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the common property of the listed models is the presence of such a neutral spin-0 resonance with mass much larger than the sm higgs boson mass .",
    "the production cross section of such a resonance would lie in the broad range of @xmath12 fb , depending on the model and the resonance mass @xcite .    .    in the listed models , @xmath11 couples relatively strongly to top quarks and photons",
    "the dominant decay mode of @xmath11 is thus usually @xmath3 , followed by the @xmath13 mode .",
    "the third largest decay branching ratio is considered to be to @xmath14 .",
    "the decay branching ratio to @xmath2 pairs in models with an extended higgs sector can be @xmath15 times smaller than the one corresponding to the @xmath13 decay @xcite . in the simplest formulation , decays to @xmath7 can be further suppressed or absent .",
    "observation of the @xmath16 process appears to be difficult due to the large qcd background and to the complexity of @xmath17 final state reconstruction .",
    "the most probable channel in which to observe such resonance in hadron collider experiments is thus @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 decay observations should follow shortly after .",
    "for some ranges of parameters of the models discussed above @xmath3 coupling can be also suppressed with respect to @xmath13 coupling or even to be absent .",
    "the latter case can correspond to minimal singlet models with colorless vector - like fermions .",
    "the following study will be based on a minimal model with suppressed @xmath17 coupling .",
    "given the potent coupling to photons , the dominant @xmath11 production mode on hadron colliders in this model should be the photon - induced vbf production mechanism ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) with small contributions from @xmath14 .",
    "the kinematic properties of this photon - dominated vbf production mechanism are studied under the following physics model assumptions :    *   @xmath11 is a neutral s - channel resonance with mass about @xmath20  gev and spin @xmath8 .",
    "pure cp - even , cp - odd and cp - mixed parity assumptions are considered . *",
    "the effective coupling of @xmath11 to @xmath13 is large compared to @xmath14 and @xmath2 .",
    "the effective coupling to @xmath17 and @xmath7 is very small or absent .",
    "the @xmath11 vbf production is dominated by di - photon interactions with some contributions from @xmath14 mechanisms .",
    "this process will be referred to as  photon fusion \" hereafter .",
    "following the assumptions presented in the section  [ sec : models ] , the effective field theory ( eft ) approach to describe the interactions of a spin-0 particle @xmath11 with vector bosons can be employed .",
    "it is assumed that the masses of bsm particles which might contribute to loop - induced couplings of @xmath11 to sm particles are large compared to the @xmath11 mass .",
    "the corresponding interaction lagrangian can be built by using a subset of @xmath21 and @xmath22-related dimension-5 operators .",
    "the resulting effective lagrangian involves the following operators : @xmath23 \\nonumber \\\\    & \\mkern -40mu -\\frac{1}{2}\\big[\\kappa_{sz\\gamma } \\ ,    z_{\\mu\\nu}a^{\\mu\\nu }          + \\kappa_{pz\\gamma}\\,z_{\\mu\\nu}\\widetilde a^{\\mu\\nu } \\big ] \\nonumber \\\\    & \\mkern -40mu -\\frac{1}{\\lambda }      \\kappa_{s\\partial\\gamma } \\ , z_{\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}a^{\\mu\\nu }        \\bigg\\ } s_0\\ , ,   \\label{eq : lagrange}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the energy scale of new physics and the field strength tensors are defined as follows : @xmath25 the dual tensor @xmath26 is defined as : @xmath27 the indices @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent respectively the cp - even and cp - odd states of @xmath11 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath30 govern the strength of respective interactions with pairs of vector bosons .",
    "cp - violation is induced when both cp - odd and cp - even contributions are present simultaneously . in the case of the gluon - fusion ( @xmath31 ) process in the sm",
    ", the distribution of the azimuthal angle difference @xmath32 between the two tagging jets demonstrates a non - trivial structure sensitive to cp - properties of the higgs boson @xcite . in the case of the electroweak sm vbf process",
    "the distribution in @xmath33 is relatively flat and thus is only barely sensitive to cp .",
    "this is the result of the interference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 helicity states of vector bosons in gluon fusion higgs boson production and the dominance of the @xmath36 helicity state in the weak vbf case .",
    "below we demonstrate that in models with suppressed @xmath37 and @xmath38 modes vector boson fusion processes could also reveal non - trivial azimuthal angle correlations .    the tensor structure of @xmath39 vertices corresponding to the lagrangian in eq .",

    "only one bsm operator is present at time ; contributions from all other bsm operators are set to zero .",
    "these observables can provide some sensitivity to the presence of an operator corresponding to the coupling @xmath51 .",
    "the presence of operators corresponding to @xmath52 and @xmath53 results in nearly indistinguishable distributions for all @xmath54 observables .",

    "note that a comparison of gluon fusion and photon fusion heavy resonance production mechanisms on the basis of @xmath54 and @xmath57 distributions was performed in @xcite .",

    "particles with these properties appear in models with an extended higgs sector .",
    "we focus on photon fusion production of @xmath11 and study various jet distributions and correlations between tagging jets from the production vertex . in the sm , jets produced via vbf are weakly correlated resulting in a flat distribution in the azimuth angle difference @xmath58 between the jets and limited sensitivity to the cp properties of @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "we demonstrate that in the case of photon fusion the higher dimension operators lead to non - trivial @xmath58 dependence and sensitivity to cp properties .",
    "this result is independent of decay processes because for a spin-0 s - channel resonance the production and decay vertices are decoupled .",
    "production jet distributions in photon fusion are also sensitive to a specific type of higher dimension operators . in particular , we show that the contact term proportional to @xmath51 in the lagrangian of the model considered can be distinguished from other bsm terms by analyzing @xmath64 and @xmath58 distributions .",
