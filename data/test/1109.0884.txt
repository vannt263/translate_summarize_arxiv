    "the bulk electronic properties of graphene@xcite are modified by edge effects in a small sample .",
    "a prominent example is a narrow ribbon of graphene which , depending on the exact lattice termination , is either gapped ( semiconducting ) or metallic .",
    "@xcite edge states may form a flat band which favors spin polarization,@xcite and may have applications in spintronics .",
    "@xcite scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) has provided considerable experimental support for these predicted edge effects .",
    "@xcite     of the various edges is indicated , as well as the bravais lattice vectors @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the honeycomb lattice ( with two atoms a and b in the unit cell ) . ]",
    "the honeycomb lattice of graphene can be terminated along different directions , with the zigzag and the armchair termination having the smallest unit cell ( see fig .",
    "[ zigzag_reczag]a ) .",
    "recent microscopic calculations have indicated that these edges are unstable against a reconstruction of the hexagonal lattice structure which increases the size of the unit cell . @xcite in particular ,",
    "koskinen _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite have shown that the lowest energy is reached for the zz(57 ) reconstruction of the zigzag edge : two adjacent hexagons convert into a pentagon - heptagon pair ( see fig .  [ zigzag_reczag]b ) .",
    "the stability of this so - called _ reczag _ edge has been confirmed by a variety of theoretical calculations @xcite and they have been observed by transmission electron microscopy .",
    "@xcite    electronic properties of the reczag edge ( and related reconstructions ) have been studied using the difference equations obtained from a tight - binding hamiltonian on the terminated lattice .",
    "@xcite in this paper we propose an alternative approach based on the dirac differential equation , @xcite with edge reconstruction accounted for through a boundary condition . @xcite",
    "the two approaches are equivalent at low energies , when the wave length is large compared to the lattice constant .",
    "one advantage of the approach based on the dirac equation is that it contains fewer independent parameters than the full tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "another advantage is that the boundary conditions are strongly constrained by symmetry , providing a simple criterion for the existence of edge states and the presence or absence of intervalley scattering .",
    "we show that a broad class of edge reconstructions can be described by a boundary condition governed by a single angular parameter @xmath0 .",
    "these boundaries cause no intervalley scattering and support dispersive edge states for @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath0-class of boundary conditions includes any edge reconstruction having a unit cell that is @xmath5 times the size of a zigzag unit cell , with @xmath5 not divisible by three .",
    "most importantly , the reczag edge ( @xmath6 ) belongs to the @xmath0-class . the value of @xmath0 can be computed from a microscopic model ( and we will carry out this calculation ) , but we also show how it can be directly measured by stm via the local density of states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec_general_bc ] we begin by discussing the general form of the boundary condition for reconstructed graphene edges and show how discrete symmetries can be used to reduce the number of free parameters to one single parameter ( the @xmath0-class boundary condition ) .",
    "we then focus in sec .",
    "[ sec_reczag_bc ] on the particular case of the reczag boundary and compute the numerical value of @xmath0 from a tight - binding model .",
    "[ sec_nomag ] and [ sec_mag ] are devoted to a calculation of the electronic structure of graphene terminated by reczag edges without and with magnetic field , respectively .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "the appendices contain details of the calculations , as well as a discussion of the effects of next - nearest - neighbor hopping and edge potentials on the zigzag boundary condition ( which also belongs to the @xmath0-class , having @xmath7 ) .",
    "we describe the electronic structure of graphene using the tight - binding hamiltonian , @xmath8 with one orbital @xmath9 per atom . in the bulk",
    "we restrict ourselves to uniform nearest - neighbor hopping with value @xmath10 . only close to the edge we allow for a reconstruction of the honeycomb lattice and variations in the hopping amplitudes @xmath11 .    in the low - energy limit and",
    "sufficiently far from the boundary , excitations with energy @xmath12 obey the dirac equation @xmath13 where the hamiltonian @xmath14 acts on a four - component spinor wave function @xmath15 here @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the wave amplitude on the @xmath18 sublattice in the valley @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively",
    ". the fermi velocity is denoted by @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the two - dimensional momentum operator .",
    "the matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the pauli matrices in valley and sublattice space respectively ( with unit matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "the dirac equation has a sublattice ( or `` chiral '' ) symmetry , @xmath27 this symmetry implies that @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "physically , it expresses the fact that the nearest - neighbor hopping does not couple sites on the same sublattice .",
    "chiral symmetry is preserved by lattice termination , but it is broken by edge reconstruction ( which couples sites originating from the same sublattice ) .      the dirac equation must be supplemented by a boundary condition that also includes the effects of the edge reconstruction .    in ref .",
    "it was shown that any valid current - conserving and time - reversally symmetric boundary condition for the dirac equation has the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the unit vector in the @xmath33 plane normal to the boundary , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are three - dimensional unit vectors . if the edge makes an angle @xmath36 with the @xmath37-axis , the boundary condition can be written more explicitly as @xmath38 with @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "chiral symmetry requires that @xmath40 , which restricts the boundary condition to zigzag ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) or armchair ( @xmath43 ) form .",
    "since edge reconstruction breaks chiral symmetry , other boundary conditions are allowed .",
    "still , we can reduce the three independent parameters of the general boundary condition to a single parameter for a broad class of edge reconstructions , as we will now show .    in the following we consider edges that are invariant under a lattice translation @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the two bravais lattice vectors of graphene .",
    "[ zigzag_reczag ] shows the translation vector @xmath48 for the example of the zigzag edge ( @xmath49 , @xmath7 ) , the armchair edge ( @xmath50 , @xmath7 ) and the reczag edge ( @xmath51 , @xmath6 ) . due to the translational symmetry the bloch momentum @xmath52 $ ] along the boundary is a conserved quantum number .",
    "a zone - folding argument , detailed in appendix [ app_zonefolding ] , shows that the two dirac points of graphene project onto the same @xmath53 if @xmath54 and different @xmath53 otherwise .",
    "conservation of @xmath53 then implies that intervalley scattering is forbidden unless @xmath55 .",
    "these observations allow for some general statements : any reconstruction of the armchair edge has a translational vector @xmath48 such that @xmath56 , and hence allows for any three - parameter boundary condition .",
    "in contrast , any reconstruction of the zigzag edge has @xmath57 .",
    "hence , if @xmath5 is not divisible by @xmath58 , the boundary condition does not mix valleys . in this case @xmath59 and the boundary condition ( for a given edge orientation @xmath36 ) has the single - parameter form @xmath60    the reczag boundary has a doubling of the unit cell with respect to zigzag ( @xmath6 ) and hence has boundary condition of the form .",
    "if however the unit cell is a tripled ( or a multiple of a tripled ) zigzag unit cell , the general boundary condition applies , _",
    "i.e. _ valleys are typically mixed .",
    "an example of such an edge is the @xmath61 zigzag reconstruction discussed in ref .  .",
    "in the remainder of the paper we will focus on the reczag edge , since that has been predicted to be the most stable reconstruction.@xcite however , we will give most of our results without specifying the angle @xmath0 , so that they apply to any edge with a boundary condition of the form . in order to emphasize this generality",
    ", we consider in appendix [ app_modified_zigzag ] a zigzag edge where chiral symmetry is broken due to edge potentials or next - nearest - neighbor hopping , rather than due to edge reconstruction .",
    "in order to obtain a value for the angle @xmath0 in eq .   for the reczag edge , we employ a tight - binding parametrization . we consider a reczag edge parallel to the @xmath62-axis ( @xmath63 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ reczag_tb ] . the unreconstructed edge would have terminated with an atom of the b - sublattice and we will therefore refer to the edge as the b - type reczag .",

    "the unit cell of the reczag edge is indicated in dark , the neighboring unit cells in light color .",
    "the wave functions in the neighboring unit cells are multiplied by a bloch phase factor @xmath67 . ]",
    "the reczag edge is translationally invariant over a distance @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the graphene lattice constant .",
    "hence , wave functions in adjacent unit cells only differ by a phase @xmath67 , with bloch wave vector @xmath53 .",
    "we allow for a variation of the hopping amplitude due to the reconstruction , but assume for simplicity that the hopping amplitude on every hexagon remains given by the bulk value @xmath10 .",

    "has been studied in ref .  .",
    "we give results for the extended model in appendix [ app_extended_reczag ] and show that there are no essential differences to the simpler model employed here .",
    "we also neglect the effects of hoppings beyond nearest - neighbor and edge potentials .",
