    "the quantum phase transitions in the superconducting arrays have drawn much interest also in relation to the bose - hubbard model , which describes strongly interacting bosons under the competition between the kinetic - energy and the potential - energy effects . here the kinetic energy and the potential energy correspond to the josephson energy and the charging energy in the superconducting array , respectively . in the presence of the on - site potential ,",
