    "strain of magnitude that can significantly alter the band structure of correlated materials recently reached via bulk strain @xcite or epitaxial strain@xcite now offers a new axis of control beyond traditional means .",
    "this new dimension presents both opportunity and challenge for theory . on the bright side",
    ", weak - coupling renormalization group ( rg ) approaches@xcite that take the band structure based on microscopic information as starting points can now aspire to guide experimental efforts  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , such proximity to reality puts higher bar on the theory .",
    "especially , importance of better understanding the sensitivity of the rg predictions against microscopic details can not be understated .    here , we focus on the impact of band - specific mass renormalization that can affect the rg prediction for dominant pairing channel in a qualitative manner .",
    "it is well - known that band structures obtained using dft inaccurately predict bandwidth . in a single - band system , this is often remedied through overall rescaling . now growing interest in multi - band systems",
    "have presented a new challenge : the discrepancy in the band mass , often referred to as `` mass renormalization '' , is often band selective@xcite . under such band - specific mass renormalization",
    "there is no simple way to reconcile the discrepancy between the dispersion of density functional theory ( dft ) based band structure and that of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements , even when the two band structures exhibit virtually identical fermi surfaces ( fss ) .",
    "now the critical question is the possible impact of such mass renormalization in possible superconducting instability .",
    "we investigate this issue in the context of strain - dependence of superconducting instability in @xmath0 .    partially driven by the fact that @xmath0 is the leading candidate material for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological superconductor@xcite , recent strain - engineering efforts and careful study of experimental band structure focused on the material . in particular , @xcite reported band - specific mass renormalization .",
    "@xcite also reported that ruthenate films can undergo lifshitz transition upon epitaxial biaxial strain of order 1.6%@xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite found the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath1 ) of @xmath0 to change upon a bulk compressive uniaxial strain and peak at a certain magnitude [ see fig . [ tc](a ) ] .",
    "they further found that the upper critical field shows a decreased anisotropy at the @xmath1 maximum , which indicates the pairing to become spin - singlet at the point .",
    "nonetheless , the large mass renormalization found in the arpes data of biaxially strained ruthenates suggests possible discrepancies between the dft - based band structures and actual band structure under uniaxially strain .",
    "in particular , the band - selective mass renormalization in @xmath0 was found to be at the order of @xmath2 larger in the quasi-2d band than in the quasi-1d bands depend on the strain magnitude@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to point out a fact that has been so far under - appreciated by the community : the perturbative rg results could be very sensitive to details in the input band structures .",
    "this would imply that extra attention is necessary in attempts to connect rg predictions with experiments . to demonstrate our point",
    ", we will take the uniaxially strained @xmath0 as an example to contrast the rg results based on the two sets of tight - binding parameters : one obtained from a dft calculation , and the other from extrapolating the arpes data in the absence of strain .",
    "then , we will compare the two sets of results to the measured strain - dependent @xmath1@xcite .",
    "our model for the uniaxially strained @xmath0 is a three - band hubbard model derived from the ru @xmath3 orbitals @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the compressive uniaxial strain along [ 100 ] direction . here , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11",
    "denote the crystal momentum , the orbital index , and the spin respectively , and @xmath12 .",
    "we employ the following tight - binding parameterization for intra - orbital kinetic energies : @xmath13 where we neglect the orbital - mixing terms . and",
    "@xmath14 lie in the region of the fs where orbital characters are well - defined@xcite .",
    "hence , we expect the absence of orbital - mixing terms in our model would not affect our conclusions in a qualitative manner . ]",
    "the dispersions of the three bands in eq .",
    "lead to two quasi-1d fss comprising the ru orbitals @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and one quasi-2d fs comprising the ru orbital @xmath6 . for the bare interaction ,",
    "we focus on the repulsive intra - orbital on - site repulsion @xmath15@xcite given the experimentally observed unconventional pairing in as - grown @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "our model above differs from the model in ref .   in that the latter has emphasized the inter - band coupling .",
    "furthermore , starting from their dft - based band structure , they found the quasi-1d bands to be the leading pairing channels although it is the 2d band that goes through the lifshitz transition .",
    "therefore , the inter - band repulsion @xmath16 of a significant magnitude of @xmath17 was cruicial for the predominantly 1d - band - driven superconductivity to nevertheless show the experimentally observed peak in @xmath1 as a function of uniaxial strain while the 2d band is closer to the van hove singularity in the model of ref .  . here",
    ", we focus on the results in the absence of the inter - orbital repulsion @xmath16 .",
    "nevertheless , we have checked that the inter - orbital @xmath18 makes no qualitative difference to the results we report in this paper .",
    "our main concern is the effects on the pairing instability from the mass renormalization , which is often present in measured band structures , despite the calculated and measured fss could be qualitatively similar [ see fig .",
    "thus in the following , we contrast and compare the rg predictions starting from two sets of tight - binding parameters @xmath19 in eq .  :",
    "1 ) the parameters fitted to dft calculations with varying degree of strain , and 2 ) the parameters fitted to the available unstrained arpes data and strained appropriately . for the first set of parameters we performed dft calculations by fixing the [ 100 ] lattice constants to the desired strain value and by letting all internal parameters as well as transverse lattice constant to fully relax .",
    "all our dft calculations were performed with vasp @xcite , using the pbesol exchange - correlation functional , a plane - wave basis cutoff of 520 ev and a 12x12x12 k - point sampling of the brillouin zone .",
    "the band structure thus obtained was then used to fit the tight - binding model in eq .  .",
    "for the second set of parameters , we use the parameters extracted from the arpes data of an unstrained @xmath0@xcite at zero strain @xmath20 . as no arpes data",
    "is currently available under uniaxial strain @xmath21 , we determine the tight - binding parameters under strain by extrapolating the unstrained arpes - extracted parameters . for this",
    ", we determine the percentage change of each parameter @xmath22 under strain from the first set of dft - extracted parameters by @xmath23 .",
    "we then estimate each strained parameter starting from the arpes - measured parameter for unstrained system as @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the key difference between the first and the second set of parameters is the band - selective mass renormalization that has been measured in the arpes data of ref .   in the absence of strain . although it is well - known that dft often underestimates band mass , band - selective mass renormalization in multi - band system poses challenges that have been under - appreciated .",
    "it turns out that the mass renormalization is focused on 2d bands in @xmath0 , which enhances the density of states of the 2d band at the fermi level substantially.@xcite    to study the dominant pairing channels under strain , we then carry out a two - step perturbative rg analysis with the microscopic model being eq .   and with the two sets of tight - binding parameters .",
    "for completeness , we now briefly review the perturbative two - step rg approach@xcite we adopt . in the first step",
    ", we numerically evaluate the effective pairing vertices in different channels at some intermediate energy scale @xmath25 near the fermi level by integrating out the higher - energy modes down to @xmath26 .",
    "up to the one - loop order , the singlet and triplet effective pairing vertices @xmath27 at energy @xmath26 are related to the repulsive bare interaction @xmath28 and the non - interacting static particle - hole susceptibilities @xmath29 for band @xmath30 at momentum @xmath31 through @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the outgoing ( incoming ) momenta on the fs of band @xmath30 .",
    "now , the pairing tendency of band @xmath30 in the singlet and triplet channels can be quantified by the most negative eigenvalue @xmath35 of a dimensionless matrix @xmath36 , which is a product of the density of states @xmath37 on the fermi surface of the band @xmath30 and the normalized effective pairing vertices at the energy scale @xmath26 : @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is the magnitude of fermi velocity at @xmath40 , and @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the fs ` area ' of band @xmath30 . in the second step ,",
    "we study the evolution of the most negative eigenvalues @xmath43 for different channels ( @xmath30 , @xmath44 ) as the energy @xmath45 lowers from @xmath26 to @xmath46 . given the well - known rg flow for the cooper instability , @xmath47 with the rg running parameter being @xmath48@xcite , we can relate @xmath1 to the critical energy scale at which the most divergent @xmath49 among all channels diverges as@xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the bandwidth of the dominant band @xmath30 , and @xmath52 is the most negative @xmath53 among all channels .",
    "using the first set of tight - binding parameters obtained from dft , we find the critical energy scale defined in eq .   to increase _ monotonically _ with the compressive uniaxial strain in [ 100 ] direction @xmath8 [ see fig .",
    "[ tc](b ) ] .",
    "this is because the active band is the @xmath54-orbital - based 1d band whose density of states monotonically increase with the compressive strain , as opposed to that of the @xmath55-orbital - based 2d band which peaks at the strain amount @xmath56 , where the 2d band fs goes through lifshitz transition .",
    "the 1d band dominates over the 2d band despite the fact that the 2d band density of states @xmath57 is slightly larger than that of the 1d band @xmath58 .",
    "this is because the particle - hole susceptibility of the 1d band peaks sharply at @xmath59 due to the high degree of nesting .",
    "this is a feature shared between our dft - based band structure and the dft - based band structure used by @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite also found the 1d band to dominate the pairing instability .",
    "it was only through a substantial inter - orbital coupling @xmath16 could @xcite find the @xmath1 scaling to peak riding on the van hove singularity touched by the 2d band fs .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath1 calculated using the second set of parameters based on arpes data peaks as a function of strain even in the absence of any inter - orbital coupling .",
    "this is because the 2d band is now the active band due to the mass renormalization which is substantially more severe on the 2d band@xcite .",
    "hence , when the 2d fs goes through lifshitz transition at the strain amount @xmath56 , @xmath1 peaks [ see the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ tc](c ) ] .",
    "note that in the close vicinity of the van hove singularity at @xmath60 , the parity - even singlet dominates over the parity - odd triplet pairing tendency as the latter is expected to be suppressed by the symmetry@xcite which is not captured in fig .  [ tc](c ) because the perturbative rg analysis can not access the non - perturbative regime . ] .",
    "interestingly , the prediction for the peak in @xmath1 and the dominance of the singlet pairing in the close vicinity of the peak agrees with what was observed in the experiment [ see fig .  [ tc ] ( a ) ] .",
    "the fact that key experimental features are robustly reproduced by the rg prediction with a simple model for interactions is rather appealing .",
    "to summarize , we investigated how perturbative rg predictions for superconducting instability depends often on the understated aspects of the band structure beyond fermi surface .",
    "we found that in a multi - band model , balance between mass renormalizations of different bands can change the balance between different pairing channels , and thus the qualitative trends of pairing properties under external knobs .",
    "motivated by recent experimental findings ( 1 ) @xmath1 peaking at a finite percentage of uniaxial strain , and ( 2 ) singlet pairing near the peak , we investigated the specific example of uniaxially strained @xmath0 with two sets of band structures .",
    "we found the two band structures to host qualitatively different trends in @xmath1 as a function of strain : while the dft - based band structure fails to reproduce the observed peak in @xmath1 in the absence of strong inter - orbital interaction@xcite , the arpes - based band structure reproduces the observed peak even with a simple hubbard type model .",
    "this shows band - selective mass renormalizations can affect balance between different superconducting channels , hence calls for realistic band - structure information to accompany strain engineering studies .",
