    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm and its variations ( e.g. , @xmath7cdm ) have enjoyed remarkable success at explaining the large scale structure of the universe . at the scale of individual galaxies ,",
    "however , cdm faces several serious challenges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one of the key predictions of cdm and @xmath7cdm simulations is that all dark matter halos share a universal density profile @xcite .",
    "the original calculations predicted a central density profile @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the galactocentric distance .",
    "more recent , higher resolution simulations have found even steeper @xmath10 central cusps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    these calculations",
    ", however , collide with a number of observational studies of dark - matter density profiles .",
    "most of the observations find either central constant density cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or profiles where the density increases more slowly than @xmath11 toward the center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "other authors conclude that the observational evidence available to date is inconclusive , largely due to the lack of high quality high resolution rotation curves @xcite . indeed , using  interferometers to obtain rotation curve data with the angular resolution and sensitivity required in order to resolve",
    "the central cusps is a daunting task for all but the nearest galaxies .",
    "the usual alternative , deriving rotation curves from longslit spectra , provides spatial information only along one dimension .",
    "this makes it impossible to separate circular and non circular motions and to check for position angle errors .",
    "other potential problems with rotation curves based solely on  are the systematic effects introduced by extinction and the local expansion flow of regions , which are especially important close to galaxy centers , precisely where the shape of the rotation curve is most important . a recent study by @xcite , however , shows good agreement between the measured  and  kinematics in the inner parts of their galaxies , indicating that at least in some galaxies extinction is not a substantial concern . despite the recent body of work on the subject , _",
    "it remains clear that we need more high quality , high resolution rotation curve measurements to advance towards solving the galactic scale dark matter puzzle .",
    "_    since both  and  rotation curve studies are problematic , we have opted for a third , complementary technique : we use co interferometry to measure the inner rotation curves .",
    "millimeter wave interferometry avoids the problems inherent to the first two techniques .",
    "first , it is much more sensitive to surface brightness than  interferometry , allowing us to routinely obtain sensitive data with 5  angular resolution or better while the typical resolution of most  studies is @xmath12 .",
    "second , not only is co interferometry unaffected by extinction , but it works best near galaxy centers where most molecular clouds are typically found .",
    "third , like  interferometry but unlike long slit spectroscopy , it provides complete spectral imaging information allowing us to obtain reliable rotation curves .",
    "the relative sensitivity advantage of co interferometry stems from the fact that the @xmath13co  ( @xmath14 )  rotational transition at 2.6  mm has a wavelength @xmath15 times smaller than the 21  cm spin flip transition .",
    "this allows the co antennas to be placed @xmath15 times closer together than the  antennas for the same angular resolution .",
    "because the sensitivity of aperture synthesis to surface brightness is proportional to the fraction of the filled aperture , compactness confers a considerable sensitivity advantage to millimeter wave interferometers .",
    "for example , the ten element berkeley  illinois  maryland association millimeter array ( bima ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has a 250 times larger filled aperture fraction than the vla .",
    "the difficulty in using co interferometry for dark matter studies , however , is finding suitable target galaxies .",
    "late type dwarf galaxies are ideal for such studies , because their density profiles are dominated by dark matter in their inner regions @xcite .",
    "although little is known about the molecular gas content of most dwarf galaxies , with a few notable exceptions they are not strong molecular sources .",
    "we have obtained co interferometer maps of several nearby dwarf galaxies with single  dish detections , a subset of which we selected for rotation curve studies . to further expand the set of suitable sources we are carrying out a systematic survey of nearby dwarf galaxies in co. thus",
    ", we expect that the results presented here are only a first glimpse of the final study .",
    "we present our observations in  [ observations ] , perform a rotation curve study in  [ discussion ] , and summarize our results in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the source we discuss in this work , ngc 4605 , is an sbc dwarf galaxy .",
    "independent photometric estimates place this galaxy @xmath16 mpc @xcite and @xmath17 mpc away ( m. pierce , priv . comm . ) , yielding a physical scale of @xmath18 pc/. the physical resolution of our co observations ( and of our rotation curve ) is therefore @xmath0 pc .",
    "the extinction corrected absolute b magnitude of ngc  4605 is @xmath19 and its size is @xmath20 ( @xmath21 kpc ) , very similar to the magnitude and size of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the line - of - sight inclination of ngc 4605 is @xmath22 , and  observations find an inclination corrected linewidth at 20% intensity @xmath23 km  s@xmath24@xcite .",
    "this indicates a maximum rotational velocity of @xmath0 km  s@xmath24  ( again , similar to that of the lmc ) that along with its size and luminosity definitively identifies this galaxy as a dwarf .",
    "carbon monoxide millimeter emission was detected in ngc 4605 by @xcite using the fcrao 14 m radio telescope .",
    "our first interferometer maps revealed co emission throughout the disk of ngc 4605 , which became the obvious first choice for a rotation curve study .",
    "we observed the @xmath13co  ( @xmath14 )  rotational transition in ngc 4605 using three configurations of the bima array ( b , c , and d ) between june 2000 and march 2001 .",
    "we mapped one bima primary beam , subtending a field with a half power diameter of @xmath25 , sufficient to encompass the co emission .",
    "the spectrometer was configured with 2 km  s@xmath24  wide channels and a bandpass of 260 km  s@xmath24 .",
    "the individual tracks were calibrated , combined , imaged , and deconvolved using the clean algorithm within the miriad astronomical package .",
    "the resulting naturally weighted map has a beam size of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 pc ) with @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ intmap ] ) .",
    "the individual planes of the datacube have an rms of @xmath29 mjy beam@xmath24 ( @xmath30 mk ) at a velocity resolution of 3 km  s@xmath24 .",
    "the datacube was used to produce a first moment map of the co emission ( fig .",
    "[ velmap ] ) .",
    "the map was rotated to align the optical major axis of the galaxy with one of the coordinate axes ( @xmath31 ) , and deprojected using the optical center and inclination angle .",
    "the velocity data were corrected by the sine of inclination angle , and sorted in concentric rings of width @xmath32 . to each ring",
    "we fit a model @xmath33 , representing the projected effects of translation ( @xmath34 ) , circular ( @xmath35 ) , and radial ( @xmath36 ) velocities .",
    "the errors in the velocity map , multiplied by the square root of the beam oversampling factor , are used to weight each point in the fit ( fig .",
    "[ annuli ] ) .",
    "the error bars for the fits ( which range from 1.4 to 3.6 km  s@xmath24 ) are computed using the diagonal of the covariance matrix .",
    "we find a small @xmath36 component , increasing outwards to @xmath37 and then leveling off ( fig .",
    "[ rotcurve ] ) .",
    "this component is never larger than half @xmath35 , and adding it in quadrature to @xmath35 does not significantly change the density profile exponents discussed in this paper .",
    "the presence of this component may indicate that the kinematics inside @xmath37 have a position angle slightly different from the optical @xmath38 ( closer to @xmath39 ) .    to extend the co rotation curve beyond 50  ( @xmath40 kpc ) , we observed ngc  4605 with the 0.6  m coud auxiliary telescope at lick observatory on the night of 23 april 2001 .",
    "we used the hamilton echelle spectrometer with a 75  wide filter centered on ( @xmath41 ) to block adjacent spectral orders .",
    "the slit was 640 @xmath42 m ( 6 ) wide and @xmath43 long , oriented along ngc  4605 s major axis at @xmath31 using the facility s focal plane image rotator .",
    "our velocity resolution was @xmath44 km  s@xmath24 , with a spatial resolution of @xmath45 .",
    "this spectral resolution is much higher than that of most published rotation curve studies , and it allows us to very accurately measure the kinematics of the inner disk of ngc  4605 .",
    "we integrated for 4.5 hours divided in 30 minute exposures using manual guiding .",
    "we reduced the  data using iraf .",
    "we removed a bias frame from the individual exposures , and combined them using the imcombine routine with its built in cosmic ray rejection algorithm . because no continuum was detected in the individual images , we registered them using offsets obtained by cross correlating the spectra .",
    "for wavelength calibration we used exposures of a thar reference lamp , and observations of a radial velocity standard star . to extract the rotation velocities we fit a gaussian to each row of the spectrum .",
    "we folded the results into a rotation curve by defining the center of the galaxy to be the point at which the two sides of the rotation curve lined up best .",
    "the typical errors in the individual points of the folded rotation curve were less than 2 km  s@xmath24 .",
    "comparison of the co and  rotation data reveals that both tracers are in good agreement over the common region ( fig .",
    "[ rotcurve ] ) . thus  appears to be a good tracer of the kinematics of the inner disk in ngc  4605 .",
    "we developed a simulation to estimate how our finite angular resolution affects both the co and  rotation curves ( beam smearing ) .",
    "because calculating the effect of the beam smearing requires assuming an underlying velocity field , we performed these computations in an iterative , self consistent manner .",
    "the net effect is very small , amounting to a velocity loss of @xmath46 km  s@xmath24  for the innermost points and rapidly decreasing outwards .",
    "although small , this systematic velocity loss is not entirely negligible in the inner 30 .",
    "we removed the effect of beam smearing from the data before performing the fits .",
    "we used 2mass @xmath47 data to derive the distribution of mass in the disk of ngc  4605 .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath2band observations to model the disk mass over more typical @xmath48 , @xmath49 , or @xmath50 data can not be overemphasized : at @xmath2band the extinction is a factor of @xmath51 down from @xmath49 , and a factor of @xmath52 down from @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we retrieved the archival 2mass atlas image for ngc  4605 and extracted the surface brightness profile using the photometric calibration provided in the fits header .",
    "we then fit an exponential disk to the surface brightness profile using data with galactocentric radii @xmath53 $ ] , finding @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the apparent @xmath2band magnitude .",
    "ngc  4605 does not have a significant bulge , and the surface brightness distribution is well fit by an exponential law over this range .",
    "the universal dark matter halo density law proposed by @xcite follows the form    @xmath56    where @xmath57 g  @xmath58  is the critical density , @xmath59 is the halo overdensity , and @xmath60 is the characteristic radius ( simulations suggest @xmath60 of several kpc ) . at galactocentric distances @xmath61",
    "the halo has an approximate density profile @xmath62 . in general",
    ", a density profile @xmath63 implies    @xmath64    most dark matter density profile studies assume that the halo is the dominant mass component , and do not attempt to model and remove the contribution from the galactic disk to the rotation , which is taken to be negligible .",
    "we call this approach the `` minimal disk '' hypothesis , since it implies that the mass  to  light ( @xmath65 ) ratio of the material in the disk is @xmath66 .",
    "the opposite limit is given by the `` maximal disk '' ; the maximum exponential disk that can be subtracted from the measured rotation curve without creating negative residual velocities .",
    "fitting a maximal disk to the rotation curve yields a maximum mass  to  light ratio for the material in the disk ( predominantly stars and gas ) .    to find the upper limit to the @xmath65 ratio in ngc  4605 we fit a thin maximal exponential disk using our rotation curve and the 2mass @xmath2band data .",
    "the fit is constrained by the innermost points of the rotation measurements .",
    "this fit yields @xmath67  ( we assume @xmath68 ) , implying a disk mass surface density of stars plus gas @xmath69 g  @xmath70 . the extinction corrected color , @xmath71 ( m. pierce , priv . comm . ) , predicts a similar mass  to  light ratio @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "this value is very close to the lower limit of the reasonable range of @xmath73 , possibly corresponding to a young starburst population according to the starburst99 models @xcite .",
    "this idea is further supported by the observation that , in dwarf galaxies , bright co emission appears to be accompanied by the intense star formation activity signaling a young starburst .",
    "the fact that the upper limit of @xmath65 is so low suggests that the disk of ngc  4605 is quite close to maximal , as submaximal disks will imply even lower values of the mass  to  light ratio . using the single dish co and  data and allowing for magellanic metallicities we estimate the gas is @xmath74 of the total mass of the maximal disk .",
    "the effect of including the gas would be to lower the stellar mass  to  light ratio to @xmath75 . because this correction is somewhat uncertain we ignore it in the following discussion , but note that its only effect is to make the @xmath65 ratio even lower .",
    "the rotation due to an exponential disk is straightforward to compute @xcite , and to remove it from the measured rotation we use @xmath76 , where all velocities are circular velocities @xcite .",
    "figure [ maxdisk ] shows the result of removing the maximal disk contribution from the overall rotation . to the residual rotation , due to the halo",
    ", we fit a @xmath77 power law in the region @xmath78 $ ] and find the corresponding @xmath79 using eq .",
    "[ alphaeq ] .",
    "the best fit power law is @xmath80 km  s@xmath24 , implying @xmath81 g  @xmath58  ( where @xmath82 is the galactocentric radius in kpc ) .",
    "this value of @xmath79 is significantly lower than the calculations by @xcite or @xcite indicate .",
    "note , however , that it agrees well with the critical solution recently found by @xcite with @xmath83 .",
    "thus , _ removing the maximal disk from the rotation curve of ngc  4605 results in a shallow halo , with a density exponent @xmath84_. the error bars including the uncertainty in the @xmath65 ratio are @xmath85 .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether the halo rotation of ngc  4605 shows any hint of a constant density core , such as those proposed for other galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the region inward of 30 in fig .",
    "[ maxdisk]b does not show a significant departure from the outer halo fit , especially after correcting the innermost points for the effects of beam smearing . while most velocity residuals inside 30  are negative , the overall deficit is less than 2 km  s@xmath24 . because the maximal disk is dynamically dominant",
    "inside @xmath86 any departures from a perfect exponential disk , or from a constant mass  to  light ratio , can account for it . among other problems that could introduce similar systematic errors near the centers of galaxies are :",
    "1 ) a displacement of the  slit by a few arcseconds perpendicular to the major axis of the galaxy , 2 ) a disagreement of a few arcseconds between the optical and dynamical centers , or 3 ) the presence of a weak galactic bar with the consequent non circular orbits . for these reasons ,",
    "it is difficult to completely exclude a constant density core using these data : in the presence of a dynamically dominant disk the rotational signature of such core is a deficit of a few km  s@xmath24  throughout this region .",
    "thus , although we find no evidence for a constant density core , we can not discard it completely .",
    "what happens if despite the evidence for a maximal disk in ngc  4605 we assume the minimal disk hypothesis ? it is easy to see that the observed rotation can not be fit well by a single power law ( fig .",
    "[ rotcurve ] ) .",
    "this suggests that there are at least two distinct mass components that are contributing to the potential .",
    "indeed , a possible decomposition of the rotation curve of ngc  4605 indicates a slowly varying density profile inside 30  ( i.e. , a core with @xmath87 km  s@xmath24 , implying @xmath88 g  @xmath58 ) , and a rapidly decreasing density outwards of 40  ( @xmath89 km  s@xmath24 , yielding @xmath90 g  @xmath58 ) .",
    "_ in the absence of a disk the observed rotation requires a two component halo : a core with @xmath91 inside @xmath92 and an outer halo with @xmath93 .",
    "_    both of these limits are in disagreement with most results of collisionless cold dark matter simulations .",
    "the removal of a submaximal disk does not eliminate the discrepancy .",
    "such a solution has a combination of the problems of each limit , requiring both a shallow outer halo and an inner core .",
    "it should be noted that the goodness of fit of the outer halo by a power law ( or any other mathematical model used to describe it ) can not be reliably employed to obtain a `` best fit '' mass  to  light ratio and select a solution .",
    "indeed , we find that for @xmath65 in the range @xmath94 $ ] , the rms of the residuals of the power law fit to the rotation curve only changes from 1.5 ( fig .",
    "[ rotcurve]b ) to 1.9 km  s@xmath24  ( fig .",
    "[ maxdisk]b ) , showing that the rms is very insensitive to how much of the stellar disk is removed .",
    "we have argued that , because we find a low mass  to  light ratio , ngc  4605 s disk is close to maximal .",
    "this solution has the virtue of requiring only one halo component .",
    "regardless of the precise @xmath65 ratio of the disk of ngc  4605 , the inescapable conclusion is that the shape of the halo of ngc  4605 poses a challenge to the cdm simulations .",
    "we have measured the kinematics of the dwarf galaxy ngc  4605 with high spectral ( @xmath95 km  s@xmath24  for the co , @xmath44 km  s@xmath24  for the ) and spatial ( @xmath0 pc ) resolution .",
    "our study of the combined co and  rotation curve leads to a robust conclusion : the standard collisionless cdm simulations do not accurately predict its shape .",
    "we have discussed two extreme cases : 1 ) the measured rotation is due to a combination of the halo and an exponential maximal disk , and 2 ) the rotation is due to solely the halo ( i.e. , the minimal disk hypothesis ) . because the @xmath2band mass  to  light ratio we find for the first case is very low ( @xmath96 ) , we believe that the disk of ngc  4605 is close to maximal and that the first solution is the correct one .",
    "this solution requires only one halo component within @xmath4 kpc .",
    "the resulting @xmath97 halo density profile has @xmath98 .",
    "this exponent is substantially lower than the predictions of most high resolution cdm calculations , although it agrees much better with the critical solution found by @xcite .",
    "if we disregard the evidence favoring a maximal disk and adopt the minimal disk case , we find that we need a soft @xmath99 core to explain the rotation of the innermost @xmath100 pc .",
    "note that while the precise value of @xmath79 for this core is rather uncertain , the fact that a break in @xmath79 is required is not .",
    "furthermore , the density profile of the halo in the @xmath101 to @xmath102 kpc region has @xmath93 .",
    "this is still noticeably different from the results of some of the recent high resolution simulations which find @xmath103 @xcite , although it agrees with other calculations that find @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "none of these calculations , however , predict the core . the removal of a submaximal disk has a combination of the problems of these two extreme cases .",
    "notwithstanding which solution is the best , both of these extremes ( and all of the intermediate cases ) are discrepant with most of the available predictions of standard cdm .",
    "we have to note that the strength of these conclusions stems from the fact that both the co and the  data , independently , reveal the same kinematics for the inner @xmath105 of ngc  4605 .",
    "a similar analysis , relying only on one or the other rotation curves , would be impaired by the possible systematics of the individual datasets .",
    "we wish to thank the anonymous referee for a speedy and thorough review of this paper .",
