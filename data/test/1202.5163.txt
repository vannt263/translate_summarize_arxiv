    "since its discovery in 1998 @xcite , dark energy ( de ) @xcite has become one of the most popular research areas in modern cosmology .",
    "numerous theoretical models have been proposed in the last decade @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of de still remains a mystery .",
    "a popular and interesting approach to the nature of de is considering it as an issue of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "since there is no complete theory of quantum gravity now , we usually consider some effective theories , in which some fundamental principles are taken into account , such as the commonly believed holographic principle @xcite . in 1999 , based on the effective quantum field theory , cohen et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the quantum zero - point energy of a system with size @xmath5 should not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same size , i.e. , @xmath6 here @xmath5 is the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff , which is closely related to the quantum zero - point energy density , and @xmath7 is the reduced planck mass . in this way , the uv cutoff of a system is related to its infrared ( ir ) cutoff .",
    "it means that the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle may be viewed as de when we take the whole universe into account ( its energy density is denoted as @xmath8 hereafter ) .",
    "the largest ir cutoff @xmath5 is chosen by saturating the inequality , so that we get the holographic dark energy ( hde ) density @xmath9 where @xmath1 is a dimensionless model parameter .",
    "if we take @xmath5 as the size of the current universe , for instance the hubble radius @xmath10 , then the de density will be close to the observational result .",
    "however , hsu @xcite pointed out that this choice yields a wrong equation of state ( eos ) for de .",
    "for this reason , li @xcite suggested to choose the future event horizon of the universe as the ir cutoff , defined as , @xmath11 this choice gives a reasonable value for the de density , and also leads to an accelerated universe .",
    "the hde model based on this ansatz has been proved to be a competitive and promising de candidate .",
    "it can theoretically explain the coincidence problem @xcite , and is proven to be perturbational stable @xcite ( see @xcite for more theoretical studies ) .",
    "it is also found that this original hde model is much more favored by the observational data @xcite , even compared with other holographic dark energy models with different ir cutoffs @xcite@xcite ( see @xcite for more researches ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhohde ] ) plays an essential role in characterizing the dark energy properties in the hde model , e.g. with the value of @xmath1 being bigger or smaller than 1 , the behavior of hde in the far future would be phantom - like or quintessence - like , which means giving very different ultimate fates for the universe ( see sec .",
    "v for detail ) . in the previous works ,",
    "@xmath1 is always treated as a constant .",
    "however , since there are no confirmed evidence at present telling us that @xmath1 shall be a constant , it is worthwhile , and somehow natural , to treat this parameter as a variable ( a similar idea has been applied on the holographic ricci dark energy in @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by this idea , in this paper , we generalize the original hde model by treating the parameter @xmath1 as a free function of redshift @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 hereafter , we will denote it as `` ghde '' ( generalized holographic dark energy ) model . not having a theory to fix the form of @xmath2 at present ,",
    "it is helpful to take some trial functions to characterize it . as a test",
    ", we consider four parametrizations of @xmath2 here , i.e. , @xmath14 these choices are inspired by those parametrizations proposed to study the eos of de , known as chevallier - polarski - linder parametrization ( cpl ) @xcite , jassal - bagla - padmanabhan ( jbp ) parametrization @xcite , wetterich parametrization @xcite , and ma - zhang parametrization @xcite , respectively .",
    "the original hde model can be recovered when we take @xmath15 in all these four parametrizations .    in this work ,",
    "we study the observational constraints for these ghde models , by fitting the cosmological data from the recently released snls3 sample of 472 type ia supernovae @xcite , the cosmic microwave background anisotropy data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 7-yr observations @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillation results from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 @xcite , and the hubble constant measurement from the wide field camera 3 on the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "the original hde model is also investigated for a comparison .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the basic equations for the ghde model . in sec .",
    "iii , by fitting data , we investigate the cosmological constraints on four ghde models each with one form of @xmath2 listed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : czform ] ) . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the different fates of the universe in both the hde and ghde models .",
    "at last , we give some concluding remarks in sec . v. the methodology used in this work is listed in appendix .",
    "in this section , we derive the basic equations for the ghde model",
    ". we will begin with the basic frw cosmology , and then introduce the ghde model subsequently .      in a spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe ( the assumption of flatness",
    "is motivated by the inflation scenario ) , the friedmann equations read @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath18 is the total energy density of the universe , including the components of matter @xmath19 , radiation @xmath20 and dark energy @xmath8 . for simplicity , we will not consider the case with interaction between dark matter and de in this work .",
    "so we have energy conservation equation for each component , @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23    combining with eqs.([eq : matterconserve ] ) and ( [ eq : radationconserve ] ) , the first friedmann equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : frweq1 ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the hubble constant , @xmath26 is the fractional dark energy density , given by , @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the present values of fractional density for matter and radiation , respectively . from the wmap observations",
    ", @xmath29 is @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the present fractional photon density , @xmath32 is the reduced hubble parameter , and @xmath33 is the effective number of neutrino species .      now let us introduce the hde scenario into the cosmology . since the original hde model with constant @xmath1 is a subset of the ghde model , we can start straightforwardly with the ghde model .",
    "first of all , let us derive the effective de eos of the ghde model . taking derivative for eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoghde ] ) with respect to @xmath34 , and making use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rh ] ) , we get @xmath35 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : deconserve ] ) and ( [ eq : drhoghdedz ] ) , it follows the de eos , @xmath36 compared with the original hde model , there is an additional term @xmath37 due to the redshift dependent of @xmath2 .",
    "this additional term means that not only the value , but also the differential of @xmath2 plays an important role in the evolution of de . in the next sections , we will find this additional term make ghde model obviously different with the original hde model .",
    "now let us have a look at the property of the ghde fraction @xmath26 , which influences the expansion history of the universe . to do this , we shall solve out the unknown @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ez ] ) .",
    "directly taking derivative for @xmath38 , and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : rh ] ) , we get @xmath39 where @xmath40 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : frweq2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ghdewde ] ) , we have @xmath41 thus , with @xmath42 , we have the equation of motion , a differential equation , for @xmath43 , @xmath44 also , we see an additional term @xmath45 in the bracket due to the redshift - dependent @xmath1 in the ghde model . in the data analysis procedure , this useful eq .",
    "( [ eq : domegadedz ] ) can be solved numerically .",
    "and once we have @xmath43 , the hubble parameter can be obtained directly through eq .",
    "( [ eq : ez ] ) .",
    "in this section , we will place the cosmological constraints on the ghde models discussed above .",
    "hereafter we consider four kinds of parametrizitions of @xmath2 listed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : czform ] ) respectively .      for this case , @xmath2 takes the form @xmath46 to be more accurate , this parametrization satisfies : @xmath47 i.e. @xmath1 smoothly varied from @xmath48 to @xmath49 from the past to present .",
    "if we assume that the ghde has positive energy density ( @xmath50 ) , we can obtain the following constraints on the parameters , @xmath51    taking derivatives for eq .",
    "( [ eq : ghde1c ] ) , it follows that @xmath52 substituting this equation to eq .",

    "<S> in the original holographic dark energy ( hde ) model , the dark energy density is proposed to be @xmath0 , with @xmath1 is a dimensionless constant characterizing the properties of the hde . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we propose the generalized holographic dark energy ( ghde ) model by considering the parameter @xmath1 as a redshift - dependent function @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we derive all the physical quantities of the ghde model analytically , and fit the @xmath2 by trying four kinds of parametrizations . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological constraints of the @xmath2 are obtained from the joint analysis of the present snls3+bao+cmb+@xmath3 data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , compared with the original hde model , the ghde models can provide a better fit to the data . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the ghde model with jbp - type @xmath2 can reduce the @xmath4 of the hde model by 2.16 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that , unlike the original hde model with a phantom - like behavior in the future , the ghde models can present many more different possibilities , i.e. , it allows the ghde in the future to be either quintessence like , cosmological constant like , or phantom like , depending on the forms of @xmath2 . </S>"
