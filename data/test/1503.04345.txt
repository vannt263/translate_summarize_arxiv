    "we demonstrate that the system can be derived , without phenomenological assumptions , as a model of the spatial - domain propagation for two fundamental - frequency ( ff ) components with orthogonal polarizations of light , pumped by an undepleted second - harmonic ( sh ) wave in a birefringent medium with the @xmath11 nonlinearity .",
