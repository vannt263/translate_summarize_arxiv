    "the formal expressions of equilibrium statistical mechanics strictly apply only to ergodic systems that are in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "thus these expressions only strictly apply to systems which are at the global free energy minimum given the system hamiltonian and the macroscopic thermodynamic state variables ( number of particles , temperature and pressure or density ) . for such systems gibbsian",
    "equilibrium statistical mechanics provides an exact prescription for how to calculate the various thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "however , these prescriptions are routinely applied to systems that are not in true thermodynamic equilibrium ( for example to metastable liquids @xcite , glasses @xcite , polymorphs @xcite and allotropes ) .",
    "it is often observed empirically that within experimental uncertainties many expressions for thermodynamic quantities yield consistent results . in the present paper",
    "we provide arguments for why many of the results of equilibrium statistical mechanics can be applied to such time independent nondissipative nonequilibrium systems .",
    "we also point out some of the limits inherent in the application of the formulae of equilibrium statistical mechanics to such systems .    we choose to study the isothermal isobaric ensemble @xcite ( externally regulated pressure and temperature ) .",
    "the methods and reasoning we use here can be directly transferred to other ensembles such as the canonical ( fixed volume and externally regulated temperature ) .",
    "the gibbs free energy @xmath0 , which is the thermodynamic potential for the isothermal isobaric ensemble , is related to the partition function @xmath1 by the equation @xmath2 and the partition function is given by the integral@xmath3,\\label{del0}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the phase space vector describing the coordinates @xmath5 and momenta @xmath6 , of all the @xmath7 particles in the system , @xmath8 is the thermodynamic pressure , and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath11 is the temperature .",
    "the integration domain @xmath12 provides limits for both integrals and extends over all the available phase space @xmath13 .",
    "this is @xmath14 for every component of the generalized momentum , @xmath15 for the volume @xmath16 , and over the volume for the cartesian coordinates of the particles . since the system hamiltonian @xmath17 is single valued ,",
    "so too is the partition function and in turn the free energy .    if we require the distribution function of a single thermodynamic phase it is necessary that other phases do not contribute significantly to the partition function .",
    "the full integration domain @xmath12 may include states that are characteristic of crystalline states or fluids states . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "this does not cause problems because , as we shall see , the partition function will be _ completely _ dominated by those microscopic domains that have the lowest free energy . however",
    "the application of these formulae to allotropes or metastable systems does present a problem .",
    "the standard equilibrium statistical mechanical expressions for variables such as the enthalpy @xmath18 , the average volume @xmath19 and second order quantities such as the specific heat at constant pressure @xmath20 may all be computed from a knowledge of the partition function eq .",
    "[ del0 ] or equivalently the thermodynamic potential eq .",
    "[ g0 ] . if other phases of lower free energy exist this computation ( from eq .",
    "[ del0 ] as written ) will strictly speaking be incorrect .",
    "it is well known that the formulae for thermal properties such as entropy , free energy , temperature and specific heat do _ not _ hold for _ dissipative _ nonequilibrium systems outside the linear response regime @xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine the question of whether they are correct for any _ nondissipative _ nonequilibrium systems such as allotropes , metastable systems or history dependent glasses .",
    "we provide a statistical mechanical theory of time independent , nondissipative , nonequilibrium systems .",
    "the theory is based on the fact that these systems are nonergodic and individual sample systems comprise ergodic domains that do not span all of phase space . we show that if these domains are robust with respect to small changes in thermodynamic state variables , a successful statistical mechanical treatment of these nonequilibrium systems can be given .",
    "we provide direct evidence , from molecular dynamics simulations on a model glass former , that the resulting statistical mechanical formulae are satisfied within empirical errors .",
    "finally we provide an independent test of the two key elements of our theory : boltzmann weights within the phase space domains and the robustness of those domains .",
    "it happens that these two elements are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the transient fluctuation relation to finite thermodynamic quenches ( in temperature or pressure ) for such systems @xcite . while the application of thermodynamics to a single time averaged system is usually straightforward the application to a ensemble , whose members may be locked in different phase space domains , can require modification to the standard formulae .    in the case of glasses",
    "our treatment has some similarities with the energy landscape approach of stillinger and weber @xcite .",
    "however there are significant differences ; our treatment makes no reference to the inherent structure and imposes no a priori knowledge of the inter - domain relative population levels .",
    "the energy landscape approach has been extended to account for the phenomena of ageing or history dependence by the addition of a fictive parameter @xcite .",
    "sciortino has convincingly shown that the addition of a single fictive parameter is inadequate to deal with glasses , which may have different properties at the same temperature and pressure if they are prepared by a different protocol ( different history dependence ) @xcite and poses the challenge to recover a thermodynamic description `` by decomposing the ageing system into a collection of substates '' .",
    "the treatment we present here succeeds in doing just that by providing a rigorous development of equilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics for ensembles of systems where the phase space breaks up into ensembles of domains whose inter - domain dynamics is nonergodic and whose inter - domain population levels may not be boltzmann weighted .",
    "a dynamical system in equilibrium has the properties that it is nondissipative and that its macroscopic properties are time independent .",
    "thus the n - particle phase space distribution function , @xmath21 , must be a time independent solution to the liouville equation @xcite,@xmath22 where @xmath23 is the phase space compression factor @xcite obtained by taking the divergence of the equations of motion ( see eq . [ phase - space - compression ] ) and @xmath24 is the extended phase space vector which consists of @xmath25 and may include additional dynamical variables such as the volume @xmath16 . since the system is assumed to be nondissipative both the ensemble average @xmath26 and the time average @xmath27 of the phase space compression factor ( which is directly proportional to the rate at which heat is exchanged with the fictitious thermostat ) are zero .",
    "the time independent solution to eq .",
    "[ liouville - eq0 ] depends on the details of the equations of motion .",
    "equilibrium solutions to eq .",
    "[ liouville - eq0 ] for the equations of motion , suitable for use in molecular dynamics simulations , are compatible with gibbsian equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "microscopic expressions for mechanical properties like the pressure , the internal energy , the enthalpy and the volume can be derived without reference to gibbsian statistical mechanics and indeed can be proved to hold for nonequilibrium systems including nonequilibrium dissipative systems .",
    "there are two ways in which the formulae derived from gibbsian equilibrium statistical mechanics can break down .",
    "the most obvious way is that the relative weights of microstates may be non - boltzmann and the exponential factor @xmath28 $ ] , may be replaced by some other function ( either the exponential function itself may be modified as in tsallis statistics @xcite or the hamiltonian may be modified to some new function @xmath29 ) . in either circumstance",
    "the standard expressions for the thermal quantities derived from equilibrium gibbsian statistical mechanics will not be valid .",
    "this certainly happens in dissipative nonequilibrium systems where the distribution function is not a time independent solution to eq .",
    "[ liouville - eq0 ] .",
    "in deterministic nonequilibrium steady states the phase space may break down into ergodically separated domains ( each of which will be fractal and of lower dimension than the ostensible phase space dimension .",
    "this is a consequence of dissipation . )",
    "however for these steady states , the domains are always exquisitely sensitive to macroscopic thermodynamic parameters since they are strange fractal attractors @xcite .",
    "often a deterministic _ nonequilibrium _ steady state approaches a unique fractal attractor . as time progresses the distribution function collapses ever closer to ( but never reaching ) the steady state attractor .",
    "the second way that these expressions may fail is that the system may become nonergodic . in this case",
    "three things happen .",
    "a ) most obviously time averages no longer equal full ( domain @xmath12 ) ensemble averages .",
    "b ) if we take an initial microstate the subsequent phase space trajectory will span some phase space domain @xmath30 where the initial phase is labeled @xmath31 . in this case for nondissipative nonequilibrium systems where the domains are robust ( i.e. small changes in thermodynamic state parameters , to leading order do not change the domain ) the standard equations of equilibrium statistical mechanics may continue to be valid but in a slightly modified form . we will examine this in some detail below .",
    "c ) given robust domains the population densities between each domain may well depend on the history of the system .",
    "macroscopic _ history can be expected to condition the ensemble s set of initial _ microstates _",
    "@xmath32 from which the macroscopic material is formed .",
    "this in turn can be expected to condition the set of nonergodic domains @xmath33 that characterize the ensemble . for a macroscopic sample spanning a single ergodic domain @xmath30 , the free energy @xmath34 then satisfies only a local extrema principle and thus looses much of its thermodynamic meaning .",
    "we use the constant pressure nos - hoover equations of motion by combining the nos - hoover feedback mechanism with the so - called sllod or dolls equations of motion , which are equivalent for dilation .",
    "it is known that these equations of motion do not produce artifacts in the systems linear response to an external field and that to leading order the effect on the dynamical correlation functions is at most @xmath35 , where @xmath7 is the number of particles @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion are,@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the position , @xmath38 is the momentum and @xmath39 is the force on the @xmath40 particle , @xmath41 is the particle mass , @xmath42 is the barostat time constant , @xmath43 is the thermostat time constant , @xmath11 is the input temperature , @xmath8 is the input ( thermodynamic ) pressure and the instantaneous ( mechanical ) pressure is given by @xmath44 . because these equations of motion have additional dynamical variables the extended phase space vector is @xmath45 . in order to obtain the equilibrium distribution function",
    "we first define the hamiltonian , in the absence of any external fields , dilation @xmath46 or thermostats @xmath47 , as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the total inter - particle potential energy .",
    "to proceed further we identify the extended hamiltonian as @xmath50 and then obtain the phase space compression factor@xmath51 where the index @xmath52 sums over the components of the cartesian position and momentum vectors . using the heisenberg streaming representation ( rather than the more usual schrdinger representation eq .",

    "[ dist0 ] with @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the argument , which has no dependence on the input temperature @xmath11 or the input pressure @xmath8 , is statistically independent from the rest of the distribution function , which is the standard equilibrium isothermal isobaric distribution .",
    "we can normalize eq .",
    "[ dist0 ] by integrating over all space to obtain the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution function , @xmath58 where the standard isothermal isobaric distribution function is@xmath59 it should be emphasized that the derivation of eq .",
    "[ dist0 ] says nothing about the existence or otherwise of any domains .",
    "these must be considered when normalizing eq .",
    "[ dist0 ] and thus eqs .",
    "[ dist1 ] & [ dist - standard ] are only valid in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "if we wish to use eq .",
    "[ dist0 ] outside thermodynamic equilibrium we must consider domains .",
    "we can also use the so called sllod equations of motion @xcite to apply strain rate controlled couette flow ( planar shear ) to our equations of motion .",
    "the necessary modifications to the first two lines of eq .",
    "[ eom ] result in@xmath60 where @xmath61 is the strain rate and the last three lines of eq .",
    "[ eom ] remain unchanged .",
    "as we have stated in the introduction , the full phase space domain includes phase points from many different thermodynamic phases ( gases , liquids and crystals ) . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "this does not cause problems . to understand this suppose we can label microstates to be in either of two possible thermodynamic phases 1 or 2 bound by two phase space domains @xmath62 and @xmath63 . by assumption we are not presently considering the possibility of co - existence .",
    "the system is assumed to be ergodic : atoms in one thermodynamic phase can in time , transform into the other phase .",
    "assume the two thermodynamic phases have different free energies : @xmath64 is the gibbs free energy of the first phase and @xmath65 is that of the second phase . for a sufficiently large @xmath7 the free energy eq .",
    "[ g0 ] is an extensive variable .",
    "we may thus express the partition function as the sum of contributions from the two phases@xmath66 where the lower case @xmath67 on the second line is used to represent the intensive free energies which do not change with system size @xmath7 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if @xmath68 is less than @xmath69 then in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath70 , the only significant contribution to the partition function @xmath1 will be due to the `` equilibrium '' phase namely phase 1 .",
    "thus although the free energy defined in eq .",
    "[ del0 ] , is given by an integral over all of phase space @xmath12 , in the thermodynamic limit this integral can be approximated to arbitrary precision , as an integral over the domain that includes the most stable phase .",
    "suppose @xmath62 includes only crystalline phases and @xmath63 includes only amorphous phases and further suppose a particular crystalline phase has a lower free energy that any amorphous phase .",
    "according to eq .",
    "[ del0 ] , we should calculate the free energy by integrating over all crystalline and all amorphous phases . in practice in the thermodynamic limit",
    "we can compute the free energy to arbitrary accuracy by integrating eq .",
    "[ del0 ] , only over that part of phase space within which the thermodynamically stable state resides .    if we consider a nonergodic system that according to different preparative protocols can be formed in either phase 1 or phase 2 .",
    "after preparation , because the system is nonergodic both phases are kinetically stable indefinitely . by restricting the phase space integrals for the free energy to those domains that contain the kinetically stable phase we can compute the free energy of that phase . however , although it may be possible to formally assign free energies to nonergodic systems , these free energies clearly fail to satisfy any global extremum principle .",
    "as we will show these partition functions can be used formally to yield first and second order thermodynamic quantities by numerical differentiation .",
    "the metastable domain is a subset of the thermodynamic equilibrium domain which contains all possible atom positions including ones belonging to the metastable phase .    within a single domain",
    "the system is , by construction , ergodic .",
    "thus for almost all microstates @xmath31@xmath71@xmath30 , ensemble averages , of some variable @xmath72 , @xmath73 , equal time averages @xmath74 , for phase space trajectories that start at time zero , @xmath75 microscopic expressions for mechanical variables may be used as a test of ergodicity in nondissipative systems which are out of equilibrium .",
    "( note a nondissipative system does not on average exchange heat with any thermal reservoir with which it has been in contact for a long time . ) in the case of metastable fluids or allotropes we may introduce a single restricted domain and by construction the system remains ergodic within this domain .",
    "a _ gedanken _ experiment can be used to justify the boltzmann weighting and the applicability of the zeroth law of thermodynamics for such systems .",
    "consider a double well potential with an inner and outer potential well .",
    "if the barrier between the inner and outer wells is much greater than @xmath76 , so that over the duration of observation ( which is much greater than any relaxation time in the ergodically restricted subsystem ) no particles cross the barrier , then the system considered as a double well system , will be , by construction , nonergodic . for systems composed of particles that are solely found in the inner potential well ,",
    "our hypotheses are that the distribution of states in the inner well will be given by a boltzmann distribution taken over the inner domain only and that if such a system is in thermal contact with a body in true thermodynamic equilibrium , then the temperature of the ergodically restricted system must equal that of the system in true thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we can justify these hypotheses by considering a fictitious system that only has the inner potential well and in which the potential function is positive infinity for all separations that are greater than the inner well ( this includes the position of the outer well ) . in accord with gibbsian statistical mechanics",
    "the distribution of states is canonical over this ( single well ) potential .",
    "furthermore the zeroth law of thermodynamics will apply to this single well system . now",
    "if we dynamically generate the outer well , all the particles locked inside the inner well can not `` know '' that the outer well has been formed so their dynamics will be completely unchanged by the time dependent generation of the new outer well .",
    "the generation of an inaccessible outer well will not alter the distribution of states in the inner well nor will it cause any flow of heat to the equilibrium heat bath surrounding the system .",
    "this provides a compelling physical justification for our domain hypotheses over a single ergodic sub domain of phase space .    in order to recover many of the basic relationships of gibbsian statistical mechanics",
    "it is also necessary that the system appears to be in dynamical equilibrium , i.e. @xmath77 , for some small @xmath78 , over the longest observation time @xmath79 .",
    "we use the definition of the partition function eq .",
    "[ del0 ] as before but now the domain @xmath30 in the integral is over a single contiguous hypervolume in the configuration space of the generalized position coordinate @xmath5 * * * * and volume @xmath16 .",
    "the domain over the generalized momentum @xmath6 and multipliers @xmath56 and @xmath57 remains unchanged .",
    "we then obtain the gibbs free energy by use of eqs .",
    "[ g0 ] & [ del0 ] .",
    "thus far all we have altered is our definition of the domain . in changing the definition of the domain we have opened a potential problem for gibbsian statistical mechanics .",
    "if we change the temperature or the pressure of the system the domain may also change .",
    "if the domain changes this may make a contribution to the derivatives of the partition function , eq .",
    "[ del0 ] , and the direct connection with the standard outcomes of macroscopic thermodynamics will be lost .",
    "thus the domains need to be robust with respect to changes in thermodynamic state variables .",
    "there are three means by which a system could have robust domains .",
    "the first and most obvious is that the domain does not change when the pressure or the temperature changes , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a thermodynamic state variable and @xmath82 is the other thermodynamic state variables .",
    "when we lower the temperature only the inverse temperature @xmath83 in eq .",
    "[ dist0 ] changes and when we change the pressure only the parameter @xmath8 changes .",
    "if the domain s boundary is determined by a surface on which @xmath84 always has a very high value it will remain unchanged under infinitesimal changes in @xmath8 or @xmath83",
    ". we will refer to a surface domain that does nt change with the state variables as completely robust .",
    "the second way is that the distribution function is always identically zero on the domain boundary ,    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the surface of the domain @xmath30 . because the domain is contiguous ( required for it to be ergodic ) it must have a single connected surface .",
    "such a domain will be robust .",
    "the third way the domain can be robust is less restrictive and allows for the possibility that the domain does change when the thermodynamic variables are changed substantially .",
    "if @xmath87 is an infinitesimal change in a thermodynamic state variable then ,    @xmath88    where @xmath82 denotes the other thermodynamic state variables , we require that @xmath89 for first order thermodynamic property formulae to be correct @xmath90 for second order property formulae to be correct etc . obviously this third way will be satisfied in the first two cases as well .",
    "later in the paper we will introduce an independent test of domain robustness .",
    "however , if a system was not robust then we would expect that small changes in the state variables would change the macroscopic properties of the sample permanently - it would be as though the preparation history of the sample was continuing even for small changes in the state variable .",
    "quite obviously if we produce huge changes in the state variables we will of course permanently change the properties of the system because we permanently deform the ergodic domain .",
    "experience shows however that very many nondissipative nonequilibrium systems are quite robust with respect to small changes in state variables .",
    "all that is required for fluctuation formulae for first second and third order thermodynamic quantities to be valid , is that the domains be unchanged , to first second or third order , by infinitesimal changes in the state variables .",
    "obviously a robust domain is an ideal construct .",
    "however on the typical time scale of interest , which is usually orders of magnitude less than the time scale on which the system will change to a new phase of lower free energy , this can be a very good approximation .",
    "we are now able to recover most of the standard results of gibbsian equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "for example we may calculate the enthalpy @xmath91 from the partition function @xmath1 , eq .",
    "[ del0 ] , as@xmath92 here we are considering an ensemble of systems which occupy a single ergodic domain @xmath30 . since this domain is self ergodic the ensemble average is equal to the corresponding time average .",

    "[ dist - standard ] or equivalently eq . [ dist1 ] with the integration limits restricted to the domain @xmath30 , where @xmath8 is the externally set thermodynamic pressure .",
    "we can also obtain expressions for the average volume @xmath19 and the constant pressure specific heat @xmath20 by taking the appropriate derivatives of the partition function eq .",
    "in other ensembles we can use the same procedure to find other variables e.g. the internal energy , the average pressure and the constant volume specific heat in the canonical ( _ n_,_v_,_t _ ) ensemble .",
    "an important outcome is that this description remains compatible with macroscopic thermodynamics . here",
    "the gibbs free energy is defined as,@xmath94 where @xmath95 is the internal energy and @xmath96 is the entropy . if we take the derivative of eq .",
    "[ gibbs thermo ] with respect to one of the isobaric isothermal ensembles conjugate variables @xmath97 while keeping the others fixed we obtain@xmath98 we now write down the microscopic equilibrium equation for the gibbs entropy@xmath99 it is an easy matter to show that eqs .",
    "[ g0 ] , [ del0 ] & [ gibbs entropy ] are consistent with the two derivatives given in eq .",
    "[ gibbs conj deriv ]",
    ". given our condition of a robust boundary we thus have a form of gibbsian statistical mechanics for metastable states which remains in agreement with macroscopic thermodynamics .",
    "we now wish to consider an ensemble of systems which is prepared from an initial ergodic ( usually high temperature ) equilibrium ensemble .",
    "there is some protocol @xmath100 , which involves a temperature quench or a sharp pressure increase etc , which breaks the ensemble into a set of sub - ensembles characterized by different macroscopic properties .",
    "after the protocol @xmath100 , has been executed we allow all the ensemble members to relax to states which are macroscopically time independent - to within experimental tolerances .",
    "we assume that the ensemble can be classified into a set of sub - ensembles @xmath101 whose macroscopic properties take on @xmath102 distinct sets of values .",
    "for the longest observation times available a macroscopic system classified as an @xmath103 system is not observed to transform into a @xmath83 system , and vice versa .",
    "the full ensemble of systems is thus non - ergodic .",
    "however , in each individual sub - ensemble , say sub - ensemble @xmath103 , the constituent members are ergodic ( by construction ) .",
    "thus we can partition the full phase space into a set of domains , @xmath33 .    from the arguments given above ( in section b ) , after the relaxation of initial transients",
    ", we expect to observe a boltzmann distribution of states within an individual domain which is therefore independent of the quench protocol .",
