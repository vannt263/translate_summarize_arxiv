    "many processes in physics involve boundary surfaces which requires the solution of boundary and initial value problems .",
    "the introduction of a moving boundary into the physics usually precludes the achievement of an exact analytic solution of the problem and recourse to approximation methods is required @xcite ( see also references therein ) . in the case of a moving plane boundary a time - dependent translation of the embedding space immobilizes the boundary at the expense of the increased complexity of the differential equation .",

    "the plasma cloud is shielded from the penetration of the external magnetic field by means of surface currents circulating inside the thin layer on the plasma boundary .",

    "it is similar to the expansion of a superconductor in a magnetic field .",
    "an exact analytic solution for a uniformly expanding , highly conducting plasma sphere in an external uniform and constant magnetic field has been obtained in @xcite . the non - relativistic limit of this theory has been used by raizer @xcite to analyse the energy balance ( energy emission and transformation ) during the plasma expansion .",
