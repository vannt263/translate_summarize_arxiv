    "imaging of extrasolar planets is a very challenging goal because of the very large luminosity contrast ( of the order 10@xmath1 for young giant planets and of the order of 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 for old giant and rocky planets ) and the small angular separation ( few tenths of arcsec for a planet at @xmath410 au around a star at some tens of pc ) between the host star and the companion objects .",
    "however , a number of different project are either now running ( e.g. project 1640 at the 5 m palomar telescope - see  ( * ? ? ? * crepp et al . 2011 ) ) or are going to begin like the gemini planet imager ( gpi ) at the gemini south telescope  ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* macintosh et al . 2006 ) ) or sphere at the eso very large telescope  ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* beuzit et al . 2006 ) ) . this last instrument , in particular ,",
    "includes three scientific channels that are a differential imager and dual band polarimeter called irdis operating in the near infrared between the y and the ks band ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dohlen et al . 2008 ) ) , a polarimeter called zimpol that will look for old planets at visible wavelengths ( ) and an integral field spectrograph ( ifs ) operating in the near infrared between the y and the h band ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* claudi et al . 2008 ) ) . in the next paragraphs we will present the results of the laboratory tests on the ifs .",
    "tests on the ifs instrument were held in january and february 2013 at the _ institut de planetologie et dastrophysique de grenoble _ ( ipag ) facility with the aim to validate functionality of the science and calibration templates and to preliminary estimate the performances of the instrument .",
    "the tests were performed both in the yj ( 0.95@xmath51.35 micron ) and in yh ( 0.95@xmath51.65 micron ) mode using the appropriate combination of lyot coronagraph and apodized mask .",
    "data were then reduced exploiting the data reduction and handling ( drh ) software that allows to perform all the required calibrations and the speckle subtraction procedure through the spectral deconvolution ( sd ) method ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sparks & ford 2002 ) ) .",
    "a further speckle suppression can be obtained applying angular differential imaging ( adi ) ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* marois et al . 2006 ) ) .",
    "given that we do can not perform any rotation of the field of view during our tests , we can just perform a simulation of the method so that our results have to be regarded as just an estimation of the contrast that we will be able to get .",
    "in figure  [ fig2 ] we display the 5@xmath6 contrast plot that we can get for the ifs operating both in the yj - mode ( left panel ) and in the yh - mode ( right panel ) .",
    "a contrast better than 10@xmath1 can be obtained for both the modes appropriately combining sd and adi . to further confirm this results we add a number of simulated planets to the raw data at different separations and with luminosity contrast of 10@xmath7 and 10@xmath1 and reduced these data following the same procedure .",
    "all simulated planets are visible with a s / n greater than 5 ."

    "<S> in particular , the integral field spectrograph ( ifs ) , one of the sphere subsystems , should allow a first characterization of the spectral type of the found extrasolar planets . here </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of the last performance tests that we have done on the ifs instrument at the institut de planetologie et dastrophysique de grenoble ( ipag ) in condition as similar as possible to the ones that we will find at the telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that we should be able to reach contrast down to 5x10@xmath0 and make astrometry at sub - mas level with the instrument in the actual conditions . a number of critical issues have been identified . </S>",
