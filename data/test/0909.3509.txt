    "this property is of interest mainly because it constrains the hilbert function as shown in  @xcite , which in turn has interesting consequences ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a spectacular application ) .",
    "furthermore , it is a difficult task to classify which rings do ( and do not ) have the weak lefschetz property .",
    "for example , in  @xcite it was shown that all height three complete intersections over a field of characteristic zero have the weak lefschetz property , but this is still unknown if we consider height four complete intersections .    in this note",

    "the key to these results is the computation of a certain determinant which was shown to play a crucial role in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the computation of the determinant in the two extremal cases reveals a connection to combinatorial objects , namely to tilings of hexagons by lozenges .",
    "while the conjecture in @xcite is for algebras over fields of characteristic zero only , our computation of the determinants allows us also to establish the weak lefschetz property also over fields of sufficiently large characteristic .",

    "however , in remark  [ r : extremal - wlp ] we notice that in general the maximal degree of the minimal generators gives no indication of a such bound on the characteristic .",

    "this result in turn gives a partial answer to question  8.2(1 ) from  @xcite .",
