    "the study of the test particle motion and fields attracts more attention of the astrophysicists because they play an important role in the study of astrophysical compact objects , particularly black holes .",
    "the motion of particles near compact stars and black holes has been widely reviewed by  @xcite .",
    "recently , motion of a particle around the black hole  @xcite , gravitational lensing by black holes  @xcite , extraction of energy from black holes  @xcite and such other effects have been intensively studied .",
    "innermost stable orbits  @xcite as well as scattering and capture cross section  @xcite of particles in gravitational field of black holes can be plausible examples for the events mentioned .",

    ", one can say that the formation of a highly charged black holes is incredibly in astrophysical conditions  @xcite .",
    "there are several observations showing that there are various scenarios where the magnetic fields and general relativity can not be neglected .",
    "one of them is the presence of strong magnetic fields in active galactic nuclei .",
    "another scenario is the production of relativistic collimated jets in the inner regions of accretion discs , which can be explained considering magneto - centrifugal mechanisms .",
    "the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic interaction is essential for characteristics of the motion , namely its stability properties .",
    "motivation for these studies arises from the problem of motion and acceleration of test particles .",
    "the study of the interaction between particles and electromagnetic fields in curved spacetimes is also of astrophysical interest , such is the case of strong synchrotron radiation emerging galactic cores , which can be explained admitting the existence in those regions of extended and very intense magnetic fields , interacting with ultrarelativistic electrons .",
    "such magnetic fields could originate in the inner part of an accretion disc around the central black hole .",
    "first attempts of building multidimensional models were proposed by  @xcite in order to unify electromagnetism with gravity . then these ideas found reflection in elegant string theory which is the subject of extensive research in modern physics and promise to throw light upon many puzzles of nature .",
    "one of the most recent theories including extra dimensions is the braneworld picture of the universe .",
    "the braneworld model was first proposed by @xcite assuming that our four - dimensional space - time is just a slice of five - dimensional bulk . according to this model",
    "only gravity is the force which can freely propagate between our space - time and bulk while other fields are confined to four - dimensional universe . in this view",
    "it is noteworthy to look for effects of the fifth dimension on our world in frame of theory of gravity i.e. general relativity .",
    "possible tools for proving braneworld model should be found from astrophysical objects , namely , compact objects , for which effects of general relativity are especially strong .",

    "observational possibilities of testing the braneworld black hole models at an astrophysical scale have been intensively discussed in the literature during the last several years , for example , through the gravitational lensing  @xcite , the motion of test particles  @xcite , and the classical tests of general relativity ( perihelion precession , deflection of light , and the radar echo delay ) in the solar system ( see @xcite ) .",
