    "after establishing the fact that neutrinos do oscillate @xcite , the window to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been opened .",
    "it is difficult to guess to what extend the already known theory of elementary particles and interactions needs altering .",
    "it is customary to believe , however , that the sm should be treated as a  low - energy approximation of a  more general theory , which will not only work for high energies , thus describing the creation of the universe , but should also use a  unified description of all the interactions , presumably including gravity .",
    "a  good candidate seems to be somehow connected with the string theory , which in turn requires supersymmetry ( as well as additional spatial dimensions ) for consistency .",
    "a  close cooperation between the development of theory and experiments is essential . despite the fact that direct testing of these models in the ultra - high energy regime is by now impossible",
    ", different models may foresee certain features of some elementary particles , branching ratios and others .",
    "these subtle clues , when found in future generation experiments , may lead to favoring some and ruling out the other models , providing an important insight into high - energy exotic physics .",
    "one can not therefore underestimate the importance of study of different theories beyond the sm and their implications .",
    "one of the most promising concepts that extends beyond the sm is supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "it is strongly connected with the string theory , which in order to be able to describe not only interactions ( bosonic strings ) but also matter ( fermionic strings ) requires the introduction of susy .",
    "susy provides an elegant way of describing fermionic and bosonic fields grouped in a  single supermultiplet , and it is a  basic exercise to show that each supermultiplet must consist of equal number of degrees of freedom of both kinds",
    ". therefore , introduction of susy unifies in some sense the description of matter and interactions .",
    "what is more , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ; see @xcite and references therein for a  review ) possesses the attractive feature that the gauge couplings unify at the energy @xmath1 gev , which is not true in the ordinary sm .",
    "it is remarkable that in order to go beyond the sm in a  consistent way one is forced to accept a  whole bunch of new ideas like supersymmetry , extra dimensions , grand unification ( gut ) and others . the problem , however , is that nobody can really state the actual details of these models .",
    "for example , supposing that supersymmetry exists , it needs to be broken , as it is not observed in our energy regime .",
    "of course the details of the mechanism of this breaking are not known .",
    "the difficulty with extra dimensions is that one needs to justify why they can not be seen , why do they not open , what is the mechanism of compactification and stabilization .",
    "the pattern and mechanism of unification of matter and interactions at @xmath2 or @xmath3 can also be only a  guess .",
    "as mentioned at the very beginning , the only link we directly investigate , leading beyond the sm , are neutrinos . in spite of the fact that it is a  neutral particle , in certain exotic models it may possess non - zero transition magnetic moments ( in the case of majorana neutrinos this is the only possible type of magnetic moment ; the dirac neutrinos may possess the transition as well as the diagonal magnetic moments ) .",
    "this happens in all supersymmetric models in which the so - called @xmath0-parity is not conserved @xcite . in principle this feature should leave a  clear signature , but the present sensitivities of the experiments are at best five orders of magnitude to weak .",
    "the observation of an electromagnetic interaction of the neutrino would be a  breakthrough and may give us important information about details of the exotic models .",
    "the problem of generating majorana neutrino mass and transition magnetic moments in @xmath0-parity violating mssm has been widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "many older approaches used certain simplifying assumptions about the low - energy mass spectrum of the mssm model .",
    "this has been corrected by the use of gut conditions and renormalization group equations ( rge ) @xcite , which made the whole discussion dependent on a few unification parameters only . up to our best knowledge",
    ", all calculations made so far used the supergravity mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .    in this paper",
    "we present detailed calculations performed assuming the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking mechanism , for the whole allowed parameter space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the model , which is the minimal supersymmetric standard model with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking and not conserved @xmath0-parity . in section iii we describe our procedure of obtaining the low - energy spectrum of the model , together with different constraints we impose on the results .",
    "next , we discuss the majorana neutrino transition magnetic moments and present numerical results .",
    "a  short conclusion follows at the end .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite is a  minimal extension of the usual sm which incorporates supersymmetry .",
    "it implies that each particle gains a  superpartner with spin different by 1/2 unit .",
    "there is also an additional higgs doublet introduced , in order to assign masses to the up- and down - type particles . in result",
    ", the number of particles in mssm roughly doubles that of the sm .    in basic formulation of the mssm",
    "one assumes ad - hoc the conservation of the lepton and baryon numbers .",
    "this is achieved by the introduction of an artificial symmetry called the @xmath0-parity .",
    "it is defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the baryon number , @xmath6 the lepton number , and @xmath7 the spin of the particle .",
    "the definition implies that all ordinary sm particles have @xmath8 and all their superpartners have @xmath9 . in theories preserving @xmath0-parity",
    "the product of @xmath0 of all the interacting particles in a  vertex of a  feynman diagram must be equal to @xmath10 .",
    "it follows that a  susy particle must decay into another susy particle , thus the lightest susy particle must remain stable and is considered a  good candidate for the cold dark matter . in many models",
    "this particle is the lightest neutralino , but sometimes the gluino takes its place . in the case of gauge",
    "mediated supersymmetry breaking the lightest stable susy particle is the gravitino .",
    "the main motivation for the introduction of @xmath0-parity is the conservation of @xmath6 and @xmath5 numbers .",
    "however , we already know that at least the flavour lepton numbers @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are not conserved , as has been seen in the neutrino oscillation experiments",
    ". there is also a  strong suspicion that at higher energies the full @xmath6 symmetry may not be exact . from formal theoretical point of view",
    ", nothing motivates the rejection of interaction terms that do violate the @xmath0-parity .",
    "this leads us to @xmath0-parity violating ( rpv ) models , which exhibit richer and more interesting phenomenology .",
    "the full rpv mssm model is described by the superpotential , which includes the lagrangian as its @xmath14term .",
    "it consists of two parts : @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath0-parity conserving part of the superpotential of mssm is usually written as @xmath16 ,   % \\label{wmssm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while its rpv part reads @xmath17 \\nonumber \\\\    & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_{xyz } \\lambda''_{ijk}\\bar u_i^x\\bar    d_j^y \\bar d_k^z + \\epsilon_{ab}\\kappa^i l_i^a h_u^b .",

    "mean two higgs doublets .",
    "we have introduced color indices @xmath26 , generation indices @xmath27 and the @xmath20 spinor indices @xmath28 .",
    "the mass terms ( self - interaction terms ) for the higgs bosons , sfermions , and gauginos take the standard form : @xmath29 where the second part represents bino , wino , and gluinos ( @xmath30 ) , and lower case letters denote the scalar part of the respective superfield .",
    "there are a  few schemes of supersymmetry breaking among which the two most popular are the supergravity ( sugra ) and the gauge mediated ( gmsb ) mechanisms . in sugra",
    "@xcite the susy breaking occurs at the planck scale , so that no supersymmetry is observed in the whole energy regime except the @xmath3 , where gravity enters the game .    in the gmsb mechanism @xcite the scale of susy breaking is much lower , and is defined by the characteristic scale of an intermediate messenger sector .",
    "the assumption is , that susy is broken in a  hidden ( secluded ) sector , whose detailed structure does not change the phenomenology of the low - energy world . in our approach",
    "we assumed that the secluded sector consists of a gauge singlet superfield @xmath31 , whose lowest @xmath7 and @xmath32 components acquire vacuum expectation values ( vev ) .",
    "the gauge mediated scheme of supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb).,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the visible world via the messenger sector ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gmsb - schemat ] ) .",
    "the interaction among superfields of the secluded and messenger sectors is described by the superpotential @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote appropriate messenger superfields . because of nonzero vev of the lowest @xmath7 and @xmath32 components of superfield @xmath31 , fermionic components of the messenger superfields gain dirac masses @xmath36 and determine in this way the messenger scale @xmath37 .",
    "simultaneously mass matrices of their scalar superpartners @xmath38 have eigenvalues @xmath39 .",
    "it is easy to see that vev of @xmath7 generates masses for fermionic and bosonic components of messenger superfields , while vev of @xmath32 destroys degeneration of these masses , which results in supersymmetry breaking .",
    "defining @xmath40 one can introduce a new parameter @xmath41 measuring the fermion  boson mass splitting , @xmath42 parameter @xmath43 and the messenger scale @xmath37 are in the following treated as free parameters of the model .",
    "messenger superfields transmit susy breaking to the visible sector .",
    "it is realized through loops containing insertions of @xmath7 and results in gaugino and scalar masses at @xmath37 scale : @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the gauge group index , and @xmath47 @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the flavor index . in eqs .",
    "( [ gm71 ] ) and ( [ gm7 ] ) @xmath50 is the doubled dynkin index of the messenger superfield representation with flavor @xmath49 .",
    "coefficients @xmath51 are the quadratic casimir operators of sfermions . for @xmath52-dimensional representation of @xmath53",
    "their eigenvalues are @xmath54 . in the case of @xmath55 group , @xmath56 .",
    "it follows that coefficients @xmath57 are equal to @xmath58 , @xmath10 , and @xmath10 , for @xmath59 , @xmath20 , and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the normalization here is conventional and assures that all @xmath60 meet at the gut scale . finally , the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 have the following forms : @xmath63 + ( x \\to -x ) , % \\label{ggm}\\ ] ] @xmath64 + ( x \\to -x ) .   % \\label{fgm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the minimal model of gmsb there is only one messenger field flavor .",
    "thus , dropping flavor indices , one can write eqs .",
    "( [ gm5 ] ) and ( [ gm6 ] ) , using the explicit forms eqs .",
    "( [ gm71 ] ) and ( [ gm7 ] ) , as @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 for @xmath68 doublets and 0 for singlets , @xmath69 is equal to @xmath70 for @xmath71 triplets and 0 for singlets . in eq .",
    "( [ gm11 ] ) @xmath72 denotes the unit matrix in generation space and guarantees the lack of flavor mixing in soft breaking mass matrices at messenger scale .",
    "@xmath73 , the so - called generation index , is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 means the total number of generations . in this paper",
    "we study the following two cases : ( 1 ) a single flavor of @xmath76 representation of @xmath77 , with @xmath68 doublets ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) and @xmath59 triplets ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , and ( 2 ) a single flavor of both representations @xmath76 and @xmath82 of the @xmath77 group . in case",
    "( 1 ) @xmath73 is equal to 1 , while in case ( 2 ) @xmath83 , because for @xmath82 representation of @xmath77 the doubled dynkin index is equal to 3 .",
    "the mssm model has more than one hundred free parameters , which drastically decreases its predictive power .",
    "the possible way out is to use certain unification conditions at high energy scale @xmath84gev and derive the low - energy values of all parameters by means of the renormalization group equations .",
    "the set of free parameters can in this way be reduced to few .",
    "this widely accepted approach connects supersymmetry and grand unified theories , and is appropriate in the sugra case .",
    "the main difference between sugra and gmsb is that in the latter all the parameters are evolved between the weak scale @xmath85 and the messenger scale @xmath86 . besides ,",
    "due to new interactions with the messenger sector , the mass matrices are constructed in a different way , which gives gravitino as the lightest susy particle , and results in further corrections .    in our case",
    "the free parameters of the model are : @xmath43 , the splitting between fermion and boson masses , @xmath37 , the characteristic energy scale of the messenger sector , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are vevs of the @xmath25 and @xmath24 superfields , and sgn@xmath90 .",
    "the whole procedure of obtaining the low - energy spectrum is explained in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and here we will recall the basic steps only . everything starts with evolving all gauge and yukawa couplings up to the messenger scale @xmath37 . despite the fact that the heaviest third generation dominates , and it is customary to drop the dependence on the remaining generations , we use all three of them in our equations . for the rge evolution the one - loop standard model equations @xcite are used below the mass threshold @xmath91 , where susy particles start to contribute , and the mssm rge @xcite above that scale . in our case",
    "the two - loop corrections , as well as corrections coming from the rpv parts , can be safely neglected ( for a discussion of this problem see ref .",
    "initially , scale @xmath91 is taken to be equal to 1  tev , but this value is modified during the running of the relevant masses . in the next step the gaugino and sfermion soft mass matrices",
    "are constructed using eqs .",
    "( [ gm10 ] ) and ( [ gm11 ] ) , and the rge evolution of all the quantities is performed back to the @xmath85 scale .",
    "meanwhile the electroweak symmetry breaking ( higgs sector ) is handled , which allows to obtain the low - energy mass spectrum of the model .",
    "of course not all combinations of the values of the initial parameters lead to a  physically acceptable mass spectrum .",
    "we test the obtained results against four additional constraints , ie . :",
    "( 1 ) finite values of yukawa couplings at the gut scale ; ( 2 ) proper treatment of the electroweak symmetry breaking ; ( 3 ) requirement of physically acceptable mass eigenvalues at low energies ; ( 4 ) fcnc phenomenology .",
    "the full discussion of the allowed parameter range for our model , coming from these constraints , is discussed in ref .",
    "+        the introduction of supersymmetry means doubling the number of particles and introducing a  lot of new possible interactions among them .",
    "susy with broken @xmath0-parity extends the possibility of exotic processes to occur .",
    "it is well known , for example , that majorana neutrinos may acquire masses without the see - saw mechanism , due to one - loop processes in which a  neutrino decays into a  particle - sparticle pair , which combines into another neutrino of different flavour .",
    "the leading contributions to such a  process are schematically depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : loops ] . in this paper",
    "we consider two possibilities , with a quark and a  squark , and with a  charged lepton and a  slepton inside the loop .",
    "other contributions , like the mixing of neutrinos with neutralinos , are much weaker @xcite and are dropped here .",
    "these processes effectively expand the neutrino ",
    "neutrino interaction vertex into a  loop of virtual charged particles .",
    "this means that one may attach an external photon to the loop ; the amplitude of such interaction would be proportional to the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "the observation of the electromagnetic interaction of a  neutrino will be a  strong suggestion in favour of the rpv physics .",
    "the problem of generating neutrino mass matrix from the rpv loops has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite , and various approaches and approximations have been used by different authors .",
    "our method @xcite , which involves the careful generation of the low - energy spectrum of the model seems to be the most complete by now .",
    "the calculation of the magnetic moments bases on the knowledge of the neutrino mass matrix , and the latter may be obtained from the experimental values of the mixing angles , under the assumption of certain ( normal or inverted ) hierarchy of the neutrino masses .",
    "the contribution to the magnetic moments coming from the squark  quark loop reads @xcite : @xmath92 where the loop integral @xmath93 takes the form @xmath94 here @xmath95 is the @xmath52-quark charge in units of @xmath96 , and @xmath97 denotes the electron mass .",

    "lepton loop two modifications are in order .",
    "firstly , the mixing of leptons is negligible , secondly , leptons are colorless , so a  factor of three drops out from the formula .",
    "we end up with : @xmath102 where the loop integral is equal to @xmath103 again , we have defined dimensionless quantities @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "as one can see , in order to calculate @xmath106 one needs to know the rpv couplings @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "these are in principle unknown free parameters of the model but fortunately it is possible to get rid of this obstacle by the use of the mass matrices .",
    "the latter may be expressed as @xmath109 @xmath110 with @xmath111 being another loop integrals @xcite .",
    "now , we assume that each mechanism ( ie .",
    "each combination of indices labeling @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) may be analyzed separately .",
    "this is a  usual approach , which is justified by the assumption that there is no fine - tuning between different processes that contribute to @xmath112 . in this convenient situation",
    "only one element from the sums in @xmath112 is present at a  time , thus reducing the expressions to a  much simpler form .",
    "this allows one to substitute the unknown products @xmath113 and @xmath114 in eqs .",
    "( [ tqq ] ) and ( [ tll ] ) by the respective mass matrix elements .",
    "the advantage of such approach is obvious , as one may construct @xmath112 numerically using experimental data .",
    "finally one gets for the magnetic moments ( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath115 where the functions @xmath116 convert the neutrino masses into magnetic moments and depend on the particles masses and v matrix elements .",
    "their explicit form and values for different susy input parameters can be found in @xcite , but overall these are numbers between roughly @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",

    "the actual numbers chosen here are not essential . in the matter of fact ,",
    "one of the most recent analysis suggests the best - fit value of the @xmath135 parameter to be slightly above zero @xcite .",
    "however , in our case this change plays no role , as the dominant part , which determines the overall order of magnitude of @xmath106 , is the @xmath116 function .",
    "additionally , we assume that the lightest neutrino mass is zero , and that the cp symmetry is conserved , which eliminates all the phase dependencies .",

    "for example , for @xmath138 the difference between lowest and highest values of @xmath106 reaches three orders of magnitude , while for small @xmath139 @xmath106 is nearly constant .",
    "the dependence on @xmath43 is monotonic , but changes its character for @xmath128 equals roughly 25 . for small @xmath128 @xmath106 is an decreasing function of @xmath43 , while for high @xmath128 it becomes an increasing function .",
    "the steepness of this function , as was stated above , increases with @xmath37 .",
    "the general behaviour is that for small @xmath43 the dependence on @xmath128 becomes strong , while the values of @xmath122 converge for higher @xmath43 and become nearly insensitive on @xmath128 .",
    "the difference between @xmath140 and @xmath141 is that for higher @xmath73 the overall order of magnitude is decreased by one .",
    "also the resulting mass spectrum is different , so that the shapes in fig .  [",

    "of course , for the case @xmath126 , for which @xmath145 ( recall that always @xmath146 ) , this feature is nt present .",
    "so for sgn@xmath142 and @xmath140 the @xmath43 parameter dominates the change in behaviour of the magnetic moments .",

    "the gain here is only one order of magnitude , when comparing the cases @xmath126 and @xmath147 .",
    "it is worth to notice , that the assumption of inverted hierarchy would not change qualitatively the behaviour of @xmath106 , and therefore we do not include separate plots for this case",

    "they span over two - three orders of magnitude .",
    "there is also a  general trend that @xmath124 has a  factor of 10 higher values than @xmath148 , which comes from the fact that respective mass matrix elements scale in the same way [ cf .",

    "in the present paper we have used the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model without @xmath0-parity to calculate majorana neutrino transition magnetic moments . in order to reduce the number of free parameters",
    ", we have assumed a  gut unification at high energy scale @xmath149 , and then used the rge equations to render the values of mass parameters and coupling constants to the low - energy regime .",

    "the latter can be calculated using the mixing parameters extracted from experiments , assuming normal or inverted pattern of neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "we have discovered that the weakest dependence of @xmath106 comes from the @xmath129 matrix , which enters the formulas ( [ eq : muq ] ) as a  simple multiplicative factor .",
    "the dependence on @xmath43 , @xmath37 , @xmath73 , and @xmath128 is rather complicated and difficult to describe .",

    "this all shows , that even if the neutrino magnetic moment would be observed in an experiment , in most cases it will not allow to state definite conclusions about the values of the paramaters in the context of the discussed model . with some luck , it may , however , serve as a  clue about the neutrino mass hierarchy , if it happens to place in a  region covered by only one range listed in tabs .",
