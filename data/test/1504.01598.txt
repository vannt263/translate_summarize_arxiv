    "_ of tmd pdfs it appears that same parton distributions functions can be accessed both in sidis and drell - yan ( see the table .  [ tab : pdfs ] for the complete list ) .",
    "therefore , dy measurements at compass will be intriguingly complementary to the compass sidis results and will give an unprecedented opportunity to access tmd pdfs via two mechanisms and test their universality and key features ( for instance , predicted sivers and boer - mulders pdfs sign change ) using essentially same experimental setup .",

    "for this purpose the best option is to explore sidis data in more differential way extracting the asymmetries in the same four @xmath0 kinematic regions ( which implies also different @xmath25-coverage ) which were selected for the compass drell - yan measurement program@xcite : @xmath26 in the left plot in fig .",
