    "in the last few years , a lot of progress has been made in the study of d - branes as probes of sub - stringy geometry .",
    "while the usual picture of space - time is supposed to be valid upto the string scale , it was argued in @xcite that d - branes are the natural candidates to probe the geometry of space - time beyond the string scale . as has been widely accepted by now",
    ", the standard concepts of space - time appears , from the d - brane perspective , as the vacuum moduli space of its world volume gauge theory .",
    "indeed , it has been found that the space - time appearing in d - brane probes at ultra - short distance scales has qualitatively different features from that probed by bulk strings @xcite .",
    "of particular interest has been the study of d - branes on calabi - yau manifolds . in @xcite,@xcite , the moduli space of calabi - yau manifolds",
    "was studied using fundamental strings .",
    "a rich underlying geometric structure was discovered , and the moduli space was shown to contain topologically distinct geometric ( calabi - yau ) phases , as well as non - geometric ( landau - ginzburg ) phases .",
    "the khler sector of the vacuum moduli space was shown to consist of several domains ( separated by singular calabi - yau spaces ) , whose union is isomorphic to the complex structure moduli space of the mirror manifold .",
    "it was also shown , that using mirror symmetry as in @xcite or the approach of gauged linear sigma models as in @xcite , one can interpolate smoothly between the topologically distinct points in the khler moduli space . in the fundamental string picture",
    ", the geometric and non - geometric phases of calabi - yau manifolds appear as two distinct possibilities , with the latter being thought of as an analytic continuation of the geometric phases in the presence of a non - zero theta angle in the language of @xcite .",
    "it was , however , shown in @xcite that the presence of additional open string sectors change this picture considerably , and that the d - brane linear sigma model probes only a part of the full linear sigma model vacuum moduli space , namely the geometric phase .",
    "it was explicitly demonstrated in @xcite that d - branes ( in the particular examples of the orbifold @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) ` project out ' the non - geometric phase , in agreement with the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "this was found to be generally true for calabi - yau orbifolds of the form @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "since the pioneering work of @xcite , which dealt with d - branes on abelian orbifold singularities of the form @xmath8 that was generalised to arbitrary non - abelian singularities of the form @xmath9 ( @xmath10 being a subgroup of @xmath11 ) , d - branes on abelian and non - abelian orbifold backgrounds have been extensively studied in @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "d - branes at orbifolded conifold singularities have been considered in @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for an analysis of a blowup of the four - dimensional @xmath12 , @xmath13 orientifold ) .",
    "of particular interest has been the applications of methods of toric geometry @xcite,@xcite to the study of d - brane gauge theories on such singularities . in the approach pioneered in @xcite , the matter content and the interactions of the d - brane gauge theory , which are specified by the d - terms and the f - terms of the gauge theory respectively , are treated on the same footing , and the gauge theory information can be encoded as algebraic equations of the toric variety .",
    "it is an interesting question to ask , if this procedure can be reversed , i.e , given a particular toric singularity , is there a way of consistently reading off the world volume gauge theory data for a d - brane that probes this singularity .",
    "a step in this direction has been recently taken in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite have given an algorithm by which the geometrical data encoded in a toric diagram can be used to construct the matter content and superpotential interaction of the d - brane gauge theory that probes it , and have demonstrated this in the cases of the suspended pinch point ( spp ) singularity of the blowup of the @xmath0 orbifold and the various partial resolutions of the @xmath14 orbifold analysed in @xcite . in the present paper , we critically examine this procedure in several other examples .",
    "we first consider this algorithm , which we call the inverse toric procedure , for partial resolutions of the orbifold @xmath0 .",
    "further , we consider several blowups of the orbifolds @xmath1 and @xmath15 and present results on the extraction of the d - brane gauge theory data from the given toric geometric data .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , we first recapitulate the essential details of the construction of the d - brane gauge theory on partial resolutions of the orbifold @xmath16 @xcite,@xcite that will also set the notation and conventions to be used in the rest of the paper and then demonstrate the inverse toric algorithm to construct the gauge theory of a d - brane probing the @xmath17 and the conifold singularities obtained by partially resolving the @xmath0 orbifold .",
    "section 3 deals with the orbifold @xmath1 and its various partial resolutions . in section 4 ,",
    "we consider the example of the orbifold @xmath18 and consider some resolutions of the same .",
    "section 5 contains discussions and directions for future work .",
    "we begin this section by recapitulating the essential details of the application of toric methods to the construction of d3-branes on @xmath0 and some of its partial resolutions which will also set the notations and conventions to be followed in the rest of the paper .",
    "recall that the world volume supersymmetric gauge theory of d - branes probing a toric singularity are characterised by its matter content and interactions .",
    "while the former are given by the d - term equations , the latter are specified , via the superpotential , as the f - term equations .",
    "these two sets of equations , in conjunction , define the moduli space of the theory . in order to define the d - brane moduli space by toric methods , the standard procedure @xcite is to re - express the f and d - term constraints in terms of a set of homogeneous variables @xmath19 , and a concatenation of these two sets of equations give rise to the toric data .",
    "let us briefly review this construction for the example of d-3 branes on the orbifold @xmath20 .",
    "we start by considering the field theory of a set of d-3 branes at a @xmath20 singularity .",
    "generically , a single d - p brane of type ii string theory at a point in the orbifold @xmath3 is constructed by considering the theory of @xmath21 d - p branes in @xmath22 and then projecting to @xmath3 where the projection is defined by a combined action of @xmath10 on @xmath22 as well as the d - brane chan - paton index . the unbroken supersymmetry in @xmath23 would then be @xmath24 in the closed string sector while the open string sector will have @xmath12 supersymmetry . in our example , a generator @xmath25 of the discrete group @xmath26 acts simultaneously on the coordinates of @xmath22 and also the d-3 brane chan - paton factors .",
    "the surviving fields in the theory are the ones that are left invariant by a combination of these two actions . specifically , denoting the action of the quotienting group on @xmath22 by @xmath27 and that on the chan - paton indices by @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 denotes a regular representation of @xmath25 ) , the surviving components of the scalars @xmath30 that live on the brane world volume are those for which @xmath31 , and the components of the gauge fields @xmath32 that survive the projection are those that satisfy @xmath33 . after imposing these projections , the @xmath12 matter multiplet of the theory consists of the twelve fields @xmath34    where we have denoted the complex bosonic fields corresponding to the position coordinates tangential to @xmath22 by @xmath35 .",
    "after projection of the gauge field , the unbroken gauge symmetry in this case is the subgroup @xmath36 of @xmath37 , and , apart from an overall @xmath38 , we have a @xmath39 theory .",
    "the total charge matrix is given by    @xmath40    with the last row of @xmath41 signifying the overall @xmath38 .",
    "the d - term constraints are now given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the charge of @xmath44 under the @xmath45th @xmath38 and @xmath46 signifies the matrix indices of the surviving components of @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 is the condition for the existence of supersymmetric vacua .",
    "the superpotential of the theory is given by the expression @xmath49x^3\\ ] ] with the vacuum satisfying @xmath50=0 \\label{superpot}\\ ] ]    using the expressions for the @xmath47 s from eq.([nonzerox ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ superpot ] ) , one can derive twelve constraints on the twelve fields @xmath51 , out of which six are seen to be independent , hence the twelve initial fields can be solved in terms of six independent fields . denoting the twelve matter fields collectively by @xmath52 , and the set of six independent fields ( which we take to be @xmath53 ) by @xmath54 ,",
    "the solution , which is of the form @xmath55 can be encoded in the columns of the matrix @xmath56 , given by @xmath57    the columns of the above matrix are vectors in the lattice @xmath58 , and define the edges of a cone @xmath59 . in order to make the description of the toric variety explicit , we consider the dual cone @xmath60 , which is defined in the dual lattice @xmath61 . the dual cone @xmath60 is defined to be the set of vectors in the dual lattice @xmath62 which have non - negative inner products with the vectors of @xmath59 , i.e",
    "@xmath63    the dual cone corresponds to defining a new set of fields @xmath64 , in terms of which the variables @xmath65 are solved , in a way that is consistent with the relation ( [ indep ] ) . in this example ,",
    "@xmath66 and the dual cone is generated by the columns of the matrix @xmath67    the relationship between @xmath19 and @xmath65 are then of the form @xmath68 thus , there are nine variables @xmath19 in terms of which we parametrize the six independent variables @xmath65 .",
    "this parametrization , however , has redundancies , and in order to eliminate these , we introduce a new set of @xmath69 actions on the @xmath19 s , with the condition that under these actions , the fields @xmath65 are left invariant .",
    "this can be equivalently described by the introduction of a new set of @xmath38 gauge symmetries , such that the @xmath65 s are gauge invariant @xcite . in our example , since there are nine fields @xmath19 and six independent variables @xmath65 , we introduce a gauge group @xmath39 , such that the @xmath19 s are charged with respect to these , with charges @xmath70 for the @xmath71th @xmath38 .",
    "the gauge invariance condition demands that the charge matrix @xmath72 must obey @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the transpose of @xmath72 . from the matrix @xmath75 given above ,",
    "the charge matrix is given by @xmath76    we now consider the constraints imposed on the original fields @xmath77 via the d - flatness conditions , and impose these conditions in terms of the new fields @xmath19 .",
    "the charges of the fields @xmath65 under the original @xmath38 charge assignments are given by the matrix    @xmath78 from the relationship @xmath79 , it is clear that in order for the charge assignment @xmath80 for @xmath19 ( corresponding to the original set of @xmath81 @xmath38 symmetries ) to reproduce that for the @xmath65 s , we must have @xmath82 , and one possible choice for the matrix @xmath83 is @xmath84 with the matrix @xmath85 satisfying @xmath86 .",
    "the matrix @xmath85 is thus the inverse of the matrix @xmath87 .",
    "however , since @xmath87 is a rectangular matrix the usual definition of its inverse ( as in the case of a square matrix ) is not applicable and there are several choices for @xmath85 . in particular",
    ", for a rectangular matrix @xmath32 , using the rules of single value decomposition , we can compute the moore - penrose inverse of @xmath32 which is defined in a way that the sum of the squares of all the entries in the matrix @xmath88 is minimised , where @xmath89 is the identity matrix in appropriate dimensions . for any choice of the inverse of @xmath87 , the final toric data will of course be identical , and in this section and the next , we simply use the results of @xcite in defining the matrix @xmath85 . for this case , the matrix @xmath85 is    @xmath90    now , multiplying by @xmath91 and concatenating @xmath72 and @xmath92 we obtain the total charge matrix , @xmath93    where the @xmath94 are the fayet - illiapoulos parameters for the original @xmath38 s , there being three independent @xmath94 s because of the constraint @xmath95 .",
    "the toric data can now be calculated from the cokernel of the transpose of @xmath96 , which ( after a few row operations ) become @xmath97 now from the dual cone @xmath75 , we can , via the matrix @xmath56 , find expressions for all the twelve initial fields in terms of the fields @xmath19 .",
    "these are then used to define invariant variables in the following way    @xmath98    which follow the relation @xmath99 .",
    "the toric diagram of the orbifold @xmath0 is shown in figure [ 322figs](a ) .",
    "let us now consider some examples of the possible partial resolutions of this space .",
    "we will discuss three possible partial blowups as in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the first example corresponds to blowing up the orbifold @xmath0 by a @xmath100 parametrised by @xmath101 .",
    "this gives the suspended pinch point ( spp ) singularity given by @xmath102 .",
    "the spp can be further blown up by introducing a second @xmath100 .",
    "one possibility is to parametrise this @xmath100 by @xmath103 ( or @xmath104 ) and the remaining singularity is the conifold @xmath105 ( or @xmath106 ) of figure [ 322figs](b ) .",
    "one can also introduce a @xmath100 parametrised by say @xmath107 whence the resulting blowup is a @xmath108 .",
    "two possible toric diagrams of the latter are shown in fig . [ 322figs](c ) and fig . [",
    "322figs](d ) .",
    "= 3.5 in    let us now come to the description of the inverse toric problem .",
    "suppose we are given with a singularity depicted by a toric diagram of the form given in fig .",
    "[ 322figs](b ) , [ 322figs](c ) or [ 322figs](d ) .",
    "we wish to extract the gauge theory data of a d - brane that probes such a singularity , starting from figure [ 322figs](a ) .",
    "this issue was addressed in @xcite , and let us review the basic steps in their algorithm .",
    "recall that the toric data for a given singularity that a d - brane probes is given by the matrix @xmath109 which is the transpose of the kernel of the total charge matrix ( obtained by concatenating the f and d - term constraints expressed in terms of the homogeneous coordinates @xmath19 ) .",
    "hence , the solution to the inverse problem would imply the construction of an appropriately reduced total charge matrix @xmath110 , the cokernel of the transpose of which is the reduced matrix @xmath111 obtained by deleting the appropriate columns ( corresponding to the fields that have been resolved ) from @xmath109 .",
    "however , although @xmath111 is known , there is no unique way of specifying the reduced charge matrix @xmath110 from a knowledge of @xmath111 .",
    "further , there is no guarantee apriori that such a @xmath110 , if obtained , would continue to describe the world volume theory of a d - brane that probes the given singularity .",
    "the algorithm of @xcite gives a canonical method by which these issues can be addressed .",
    "it consists of determining the fields to be resolved by tuning the fayet - illiopoulos parameters appropriately ( so that the resulting theory at the end is still a physical d - brane gauge theory ) and then reading off the the matrix @xmath110 which can be separated into the f and d - terms and thus can be used to obtain the matter content and the superpotential determining the gauge theory .",
    "let us discuss this in some more details .",
    "the toric diagrams for the partially resolved singularities are obtained by the deletion of of a subset of nodes from the original one .",
    "conversely , a given toric diagram of dimension @xmath112 can be embedded into a singularity of the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 . in our case",
    ", the singularities mentioned above can be embedded into the toric diagram for the singularity @xmath115 .",
    "for example , the spp , and the conifold singularity can both be embedded into the @xmath0 singularity , as is obvious from their toric diagrams .",
    "we shall henceforth refer to these singularities , in which we embed the partially resolved ones as the parent singularities .",
    "a toric diagram corresponding to a partial resolution can of course be embedded in more than one parent singularity and according to the algorithm of @xcite , one can choose the minimal embedding .",
    "we will return to this issue in a while .",
    "we now determine the fields to be resolved from the parent singularity in order to reach the given toric diagram , by appropriately choosing the values of @xmath94 .",
    "the difficulty that arises here is that given the toric diagram of the singularity that we are interested in , there is no unique way of knowing exactly which fields ( in the toric data of the parent singularity ) have to be resolved in order to reach the toric singularity of interest . given a toric diagram for the parent singularity , a particular resolution , along with the elimination of one or more nodes , might also require a subset of fields from some other nodes to be resolved .",
    "hence , we have to carefully tune the fi parameters for a consistent blowup of the parent singularity to the one that we are interested in .",
    "we now illustrate this procedure by the example of the blowup of the @xmath0 singularity to the @xmath108 orbifold illustrated in fig . [ 322figs](c ) .",
    "this example is , in a sense , straightforward , because from the toric diagram of fig . [",
    "322figs](c ) , it is clear that this being the @xmath17 singularity , we can directly read off the matter content and the interactions from the standard results for d3-branes on the @xmath17 orbifold @xcite .",
    "however , note that this is the simplest example where the inverse procedure of calculating the d - brane gauge theory has to be valid .",
    "the @xmath17 orbifold can be thought of as partial resolutions of the orbifolds @xmath0 , or @xmath1 , and the inverse toric procedure must give familiar results for both in agreement with @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a lower dimensional toric orbifold can always be embedded in the toric diagram of one of higher dimension , and the inverse toric procedure must consistently reproduce the d - brane gauge theory on the former , starting from the latter data . as we will see , this is indeed the case .",
    "we proceed by embedding the @xmath17 singularity in @xmath0 . in order to determine the fields to be resolved , we perform gaussian row reduction on the the matrix @xmath96 to obtain @xmath116    the above set of equations imply the constraints @xmath117    where , for convenience of notation",
    ", we have labelled @xmath118 .",
    "this set of equations is now solved in terms of the fields that we know would definitely get resolved . from the toric diagram ,",
    "three such fields are @xmath119 . however , from the relation between @xmath120 and @xmath121 above , it suffices to solve the above set of equations in terms of @xmath122 and @xmath121 , say .",
    "this gives the solution set , @xmath123&=&\\left[x_1,(2x_9-x_7-\\zeta_1-\\zeta_2),(x_1 + \\zeta_2+\\zeta_3 ) , ( x_1+x_7-x_9+\\zeta_2),\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & ~&(2x_1+x_7 - 2x_9+\\zeta_1 + 2\\zeta_2+\\zeta_3 ) ( x_1+x_7-x_9+\\zeta_1+\\zeta_2+\\zeta_3),\\nonumber\\\\ & ~&\\left.x_7,(x_9- \\zeta_1-\\zeta_2 ) , x_9\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , from the toric diagram of fig.[322figs](c ) , we choose the fields @xmath124 $ ] to have zero vev i.e these fields continue to remain dynamical .",
    "thus , in the above solution set , we impose @xmath125 to obtain @xmath126=\\left[0,0,0,(x_9-\\zeta_1),0,(x_7-x_9+\\zeta_1),x_7 , ( x_9-\\zeta_1-\\zeta_2),x_9\\right]\\ ] ]    we further set @xmath127 in order to make @xmath128 . hence , @xmath129 . also , @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , the fields to be resolved are @xmath131 $ ] , all of which have positive vevs .",
    "we now need to obtain the reduced charge matrix for this choice of variables to be resolved .",
    "the method of doing this essentially consists of performing row operations on the full charge matrix @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ fullq ] ) , such that the columns corresponding to the resolved fields @xmath131 $ ] are set to zero .",
    "the reduced charge matrix @xmath110 thus obtained must be in the nullspace of the reduced toric matrix @xmath132 , that can be directly evaluated from the full toric matrix in eq .",
    "( [ fulltoricdata ] ) by removing the columns @xmath133 .",
    "let us first discuss the general formalism for achieving this , which can then be easily applied to our present example .",
    "consider a general parent theory that has a total charge matrix @xmath96 of dimensions @xmath134 , and suppose we wish to eliminate @xmath41 fields from the parent theory in order to reach the theory of interest .",
    "this implies that we have to perform row operations on @xmath96 so that the given @xmath41 columns will have zero entries and thus be eliminated .",
    "the latter can be achieved by constructing the nullspace of the transpose of a submatrix that is formed by precisely the @xmath41 columns that need to be eliminated .",
    "further , since the toric data @xmath109 was initially in the nullspace of @xmath96 , removal of the @xmath41 columns from @xmath96 to obtain @xmath110 would mean that the reduced toric data @xmath111 with the same @xmath41 columns removed would be in the nullspace of @xmath110 .",
    "thus , the expression for @xmath110 is given by @xcite @xmath135 \\label{qreduced}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 is the transpose of the matrix obtained from @xmath72 containing as its columns , the deleted columns of @xmath72 and @xmath137 is the remaining matrix .",
    "in our example , we evaluate @xmath138 directly , by writing @xmath136 as the transpose of the matrix that contains columns @xmath133 of the charge matrix @xmath96 , and @xmath137 being the matrix containing the columns @xmath139 of @xmath96 .",
    "this implies that the reduced charge matrix is @xmath140 from this , the reduced charge matrices corresponding to the f and d - terms are @xmath141 denoting the kernel of the charge matrix by @xmath142 , the transpose of its dual is the reduced @xmath143 matrix , @xmath144    now , from eq .",
    "( [ indep ] ) , the charge matrix for the initial fields @xmath77 are given , via the charge matrix for the independent fields @xmath65 by the relation @xmath145 hence , in this case , making use of the identity @xmath146 , the matter content for the d - brane gauge theory on the resolved space is obtained as @xmath147 . from which in this case we obtain the matrix @xmath148 where we have included an extra row corresponding to the redundant @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the gauge group is seen to be @xmath149 , with four bifundamentals , in agreement with the result of @xcite .",
    "also note that one adjoint field has appeared in our expression .",
    "this signals an ambiguity that exists in the toric procedure with regards to handling chargeless fields .",
    "consider , for example , the superpotential interaction , which can be determined from the matrix @xmath56 that encodes the f - flatness conditions .",
    "the number of columns in the matrix @xmath150 is the number of fields that appear in the interactions and the terms in the superpotential are read off as linear relations between the columns of @xmath151 . in this example , from the matrix @xmath56 , we have the relation @xmath152 , and from the @xmath41 matrix , we can see that each of these have charge zero .",
    "hence , we try as an ansatz for the superpotential , @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a field uncharged for both the @xmath38 s .",
    "this agrees with @xcite after the identification @xmath155 .",
    "as is clear , however , there is an ambiguity in writing the superpotential due to the presence of fields that are chargeless under both the @xmath38 s @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that we can carry out the inverse procedure just outlined for the case of the alternative blowup to @xmath156 shown in figure [ 322figs](d ) .",
    "this gives exactly the same matter content and superpotential as the case just analysed , in the region of moduli space given by @xmath157 , @xmath158 .",
    "+ @xmath159 we now discuss the example of the blowup of the @xmath160 singularity to the conifold . proceeding in the same way as above , we now find that in the region of the fi parameters determined by @xmath161 , the fields to be resolved are @xmath162 $ ] , when the fields @xmath163 $ ] are chosen dynamical , i.e continue to have zero vev .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ qreduced ] ) , we obtain the reduced charge matrix to be @xmath164 note that in this , case , there are no f - terms and we have @xmath165 , moreover , the kernel of this matrix is the @xmath166 identity matrix , i.e @xmath167 , which implies that ( since the dual matrix of @xmath142 is also the @xmath166 identity matrix ) @xmath168 , with the charge matrix given in this case ( by adding the extra column corresponding to the overall @xmath38 ) as @xmath169 in this case , the matrix @xmath138 being zero , there are no f - terms and the entire gauge theory information is contained in the d - term .",
