    "heavy - ion storage rings equipped with electron coolers are an excellent experimental environment for electron - ion collision studies .",
    "some recent studies of dielectronic recombination ( dr ) focussed on high - resolution spectroscopy of highly - charged ions .",
    "highlights of this research are the measurement of the hyperfine induced decay rate of the @xmath0 state in berylliumlike ti@xmath1 @xcite utilizing dr at the storage ring tsr of the heidelberg max - planck - institute for nuclear physics , the observation of the isotope shift in dr of three - electron nd@xmath2 @xcite using different isotopes of this ion at gsi s storage ring esr and the observation of the hyperfine splitting of sc@xmath1 low - energy dr resonances at the tsr high - resolution electron target @xcite .",
    "the latter experiment resulted in the determination of the sc@xmath1(@xmath3 ) energy splitting with an uncertainty of only 4.6 ppm which is less than 1% of the few - body effects on radiative corrections @xcite . since these exciting developments have already been reviewed recently @xcite , the present review focusses on the relevance of storage - ring electron - ion experiments for astrophysics .",
    "storage - ring experiments provide particularly valuable information on dr in low - temperature plasmas such as photoionized plasmas that occur , e.g. , in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the vicinity of super - massive black holes @xcite . in such plasmas",
    "highly charged ions exist at relatively low temperatures .",
    "for many ions , the dr rate coefficients , that determine the charge balance in these plasmas , depend sensitively on the low - energy dr resonance structure at relative electron - ion energies below @xmath4 3 ev . in the following ,",
    "the influence of low - energy dr resonances on electron - ion recombination rate coefficients in low - density plasmas and recent efforts of building a recombination data base for astrophysical modeling of photoionized plasmas are briefly discussed .",
    "finally , a compilation of experimental results for the astrophysically most abundant ions is presented .",
    "a ) experimental merged - beams rate coefficients for the recombination of electrons with be - like mg@xmath5 ions at low electron - ion collision energies measured at the heidelberg heavy - ion storage ring tsr @xcite . the theoretically calculated contribution by non - resonant radiative recombination ( rr ) is shown as a dashed line .",
    "the inset shows the effect of hypothetical resonance shifts by @xmath650 mev ( dashed curves ) and by @xmath6100 mev ( dotted curves ) on the mg@xmath5 recombination - rate coefficient in a plasma .",
    "the temperature range where mg@xmath5 occurs in a photoionized plasma is highlighted .",
    "b ) the experimental mg@xmath5 recombination - rate coefficient in a plasma @xcite at low temperatures compared with recent state - of - the - art theoretical results by colgan et al .  @xcite ( dashed curve ) and gu @xcite ( dash - dotted curve ) . ]",
    "a ) experimental ( filled circles ) @xcite and theoretical ( shaded curve ) @xcite merged - beams rate coefficient for the recombination of electrons with al - like fe@xmath7 ions at low electron - ion collision energies .",
    "b ) fe@xmath7 recombination - rate coefficient in a plasma .",
    "the experimental result from the tsr ( full curve ) is compared with the theoretical rate coefficient from the widely used compilation of arnaud & raymond @xcite ( dash dotted curve ) and the recent state - of - the - art calculation of badnell @xcite ( dash - dot dotted curve ) .",
    "the contribution of rr to the latter is shown as a dotted curve .",
    "the dashed curve is the contribution of the low - energy dr resonances shown in panel a ) to the total plasma rate coefficient",
    ". the temperature ranges where fe@xmath7 exists in photoionized plasmas ( pp ) and collisionally ionized plasmas ( cp ) are highlighted . ]",
    "figure [ fig : mg8]a shows the measured mg@xmath5 recombination rate coefficient @xcite at electron - ion collision energies below 200  mev .",
    "the strongest dielectronic recombination ( dr ) resonance occurs at 21  mev .",
    "the inset shows that the rate coefficient in plasma changes by more than an order of magnitude when the low - energy resonances are shifted by as little as @xmath6100  mev .",
    "usually , for ions with more than three electrons , the theoretical uncertainties for dr resonance energies are much larger",
    ". correspondingly , the uncertainties of calculated recombination rate coefficients in a plasma can be rather large , especially at low temperatures where photoionized plasmas exist .",
    "as an example figure  [ fig : mg8]b compares the experimentally derived mg@xmath5 rate coefficient in a plasma with two recent state - of - the - art calculations .",
    "the deviations of the theoretical from the experimental results are as large as a factor of 2 and , additionally , there is considerable discrepancy between both theoretical curves .",
    "this situation can be regarded as typical .",
    "even state - of - the - art atomic codes are not always capable of providing reliable low - temperature dr plasma rate coefficients for ions .",
    "the difficulty in calculating sufficiently precise dr resonance energies is rooted in the many - body nature of the problem . only in special cases , where one electron is outside a closed shell , relativistic perturbation theory ( rmbpt ) yields reliable low - energy dr resonance parameters as has been demonstrated , e.g. , for li - like fluorine @xcite , sodium @xcite , and scandium @xcite as well as for na - like silicon @xcite .",
    "however , rmbpt can not easily be extended to more complex ionic systems and , therefore , can not satisfy the vast astrophysical atomic data needs .",
    "cosmic atomic plasmas can be divided into broad classes , collisionally ionized plasmas ( cp ) and photoionized plasmas ( pp ) @xcite . historically , most theoretical recombination data were calculated for cp where highly charged ions exist only at rather large temperatures , e.g. , in the solar corona . at these temperatures ,",
    "recombination rate coefficients are largely insensitive to low - energy dr resonances .",
    "consequently , the theoretical uncertainties are much smaller at higher than at lower plasma temperatures which are typical for pp . until recently , theoretical recombination rate coefficients were mainly calculated for the cp temperature ranges ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if these data are used for the astrophysical modeling of pp , inconsistencies arise .",
    "this has been noted , e.g. , in the astrophysical modeling of x - ray spectra from agn by netzer @xcite and kraemer et al .",
    "on the basis of astrophysical modeling these authors have suspected that the dr rate coefficients for iron ions with an open m - shell ( fe@xmath8fe@xmath9 ) from the widely used compilation of arnaud & raymond @xcite are much too low in the pp temperature range .    these findings motivated storage - ring recombination measurements with iron m - shell ions .",
    "figure [ fig : fe13 ] shows results , that were obtained for al - like fe@xmath7 ions .",
    "the low - energy merged - beams recombination rate coefficient ( figure [ fig : fe13]a ) is dominated by strong dr resonances that decisively determine the low - temperature recombination rate coefficient in a pp ( dashed line in figure [ fig : fe13]b ) .",
    "as suspected , the experimentally derived pp rate coefficient is considerably higher  by up to orders of magnitude  than the early theoretical result from the compilation of arnaud & raymond @xcite ( figure [ fig : fe13]b ) .",
    "such discrepancies have also been found for other iron m - shell ions ( see references in table  [ tab : dr ] ) .",
    "it is clear , that the large discrepancies between the experimental and the early theoretical rate coefficients are due to a simplified theoretical treatment that was geared towards cp and more or less disregarded low - energy dr in order to keep the calculations tractable .",
    "modern computers allow more sophisticated approaches , and recent theoretical work has aimed at providing a more reliable recombination data - base by using state - of - the - art atomic codes @xcite .",
    "badnell and coworkers @xcite have calculated dr rate coefficients for finite - density plasmas .",
    "results have been published for the isoelectronic sequences from h - like to mg - like @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "complementary rr rate coefficients are also available @xcite . independently , gu calculated dr and rr rate coefficients for selected ions of astrophysical interest @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mg8]b shows the mg@xmath5 dr results from these two data sets .",
    "although the new theoretical work removes the striking low - temperature disagreement that was found between experimental and early theoretical results , uncertainties remain as discussed above .    for the recombination of fe@xmath7 a detailed comparison between the experimental and new theoretical results",
    "was presented by badnell @xcite .",
    "experimental and calculated low - energy merged - beams recombination rate coefficients are shown in figure [ fig : fe13]a .",
    "although calculated and measured dr resonance structures are approximately of the same height there are many differences in the details . fortuitously , these differences largely average out in the plasma recombination rate coefficient .",
    "still , the theoretical plasma rate coefficient is up to 50% smaller than the experimental one in the pp temperature range ( figure [ fig : fe13]b ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "storage ring experiments are presently the only reliable source for low - temperature dr data .",
    "moreover , they provide valuable benchmarks for the further development of the theoretical methods .",
    "for the interpretation and understanding of astronomical observations numerical models of astrophysical plasmas are used @xcite . as an input these models require atomic data especially for the 15 most abundant elements @xcite .",
    "their relative abundances in the solar photosphere @xcite are depicted in figure [ fig : relabundance ] .",
    "table [ tab : dr ] lists those astrophysically relevant ions for which experimental results on electron - ion recombination have been obtained from storage - ring measurements .",
    "the corresponding references are given .",
    "more comprehensive but now somewhat outdated compilations which additionally contain results from early single - pass merged - beams experiments as well as results for other ions have been published previously @xcite .",
