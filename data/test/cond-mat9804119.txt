    "the interaction of a localized spin impurity with the conduction electrons of a metal is a well known and interesting problem@xcite .",

    "non - equilibrium properties of these systems , however , are not well understood .",
    "recent advances in the construction of small quantum dots permit a high degree of control in the coupling between localized and extended electronic states .",
    "measurements of transport through dots give clear evidence for the kondo effect.@xcite shao , nordlander , and langreth ( snl ) recently pointed out@xcite that atomic scattering off metal surfaces is another arena for the kondo effect .",
    "the rich variety of atomic levels , workfunctions , and couplings permits the investigation of many regimes .",
    "for example , as it encounters the surface , an atom can evolve from the empty orbital regime into the local moment regime , passing through the mixed valence state at intermediate distances from the surface .",
    "strikingly , the kondo scale can easily attain room temperature because the atomic level crosses the fermi energy .",
    "the velocity of the incoming ion may also be tuned to probe the different regimes . however , only at sufficiently small velocities is there enough time for a well - developed kondo resonance to form .",
    "the kondo screening cloud manifests itself in enhanced neutralization probabilities at low speeds and reduced temperatures .",
    "one theoretical approach used to analyze highly non - equilibrium atom - surface systems is the keldysh green s function technique@xcite , combined with the non - crossing approximation ( nca)@xcite .",
    "this approach typically takes the repulsive coulomb interaction strength @xmath2 between electrons residing on the impurity or scattered atom to be infinite .",
    "although nca has been extended to treat the case of finite @xmath2 , at least in the static case@xcite , it can only be easily applied to the dynamical problem in the @xmath0 limit .",
    "however , renormalization group ( rg ) calculations show that the parameters of the system in the finite-@xmath2 case@xcite can differ significantly from those in the @xmath0 limit ; in particular the kondo temperature depends on @xmath2 .",
    "thus physically reasonable values for @xmath2 should be used in realistic calculations . finally , nca has additional problems as it neglects vertex corrections .",
    "fermi liquid relations are not recovered at zero temperature .",
    "instead spurious behavior shows up in the spectral density of the impurity@xcite .    in this article we present an alternative approach , namely , the dynamical @xmath1 method .",
    "details of the method have been presented in [ i]@xcite . both resonant and auger processes can be treated in the same framework , as can finite @xmath2 .",

    "finally , the physically relevant case of finite-@xmath2 and @xmath9 is examined to determine whether or not kondo effects are accessible to charge transfer experiments .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] with a discussion of the conditions which must be satisfied in charge transfer experiments which search for the kondo effect .",
    "independent - particle descriptions of charge transfer fail to account for many interesting and non - trivial phenomena . here",

    "parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , the orbital energies and matrix elements for 1 and 2 electrons .",
    "the use of the projector operators enable us to use different couplings depending on the number of electrons in the atom .",
    "the couplings are divided by the square root of the degeneracy @xmath21 so that the atomic width @xmath22 remains finite and well - defined in the @xmath23 limit .",
    "as excited states of the atom with two electrons occupy orbitals high in energy they are excluded .",
    "we therefore take @xmath24 when @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the limit @xmath27 the above hamiltonian",

    "explicit time dependence enters through the classical ion trajectory . as the ion s kinetic energy",
    "is typically much larger than the electronic energy , the trajectory to a good approximation may be considered fixed .",

    "while a free alkali atom , say li , has one electron in the valence s - orbital , li(@xmath49 ) , an alkaline - earth atom , say ca , has a filled s - shell configuration , ca(@xmath50 ) . due to the image potential , the neutral li atom tends to ionize by transfer of its valence electron close to the cu surface , yielding the closed - shell configuration @xmath51 .",
    "in contrast , the most probable state of a ca atom close to the surface is @xmath52 which has an unpaired spin in the valence orbital .",
    "this difference is what makes the alkaline - earth atoms interesting candidates for revealing the properties of the kondo screening cloud near metal surfaces .",
    "we may easily treat the case of alkaline - earth atoms ( denoted by ae ) within the wavefunction ansatz discussed below in the next subsection by performing a particle - hole transformation .",
    "this canonical transformation is implemented by switching all of the electron creation and annihilation operators : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "minus signs have been introduced to keep the @xmath57 matrix elements invariant . if @xmath58 is particle - hole symmetric as we assume , the transformation leaves the hamiltonian unchanged up to an irrelevant additive constant as long as the energy of the atomic orbital is also reversed in sign .",
    "thus @xmath59 should now be interpreted as the energy time of one hole in the s - orbital of the atom , corresponding to a positive alkaline - earth ion , @xmath60 . in this case",
    "it is appropriate to set the energy of the neutral atom to zero , @xmath61 = 0 $ ] .",
    "also the image shift is reversed in sign .",

    "the time - dependent many - body wavefunction is systematically expanded into sectors which contain an increasing number of particle - hole pairs in the metal .",
    "amplitudes for sectors with more and more particle - hole pairs are reduced by powers of @xmath1 .",
    "this approach was used with success by varma and yafet@xcite and by gunnarsson and schnhammer@xcite , to describe the static ground state properties and spectral densities of metal impurities such as ce .",
    "it was first applied to the dynamical problem in 1985 by brako and newns@xcite ; three sectors were included in this pioneering work .",
    "subsequent work work extended this ansatz@xcite .",
    "the improved ansatz for our wavefunction now has six sectors ( for details , see [ i ] ) : @xmath66 here @xmath67 represents the unperturbed filled fermi sea of the metal and either an empty alkali valence orbital ( @xmath68 ) or a filled alkaline - earth orbital ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "as the hamiltonian conserves spin , the many - body wavefunction describes the spin singlet sector of the hilbert space .",
    "the physical meaning of each of the amplitudes differs for alkali and alkaline earth atoms . for alkalis @xmath70",
    "is the amplitude for a positive ion with an empty valence shell , one electron in state @xmath71 of the metal , and one hole in state @xmath72 of the metal where @xmath73 is the fermi momentum .",
    "for alkaline - earths , on the other hand , @xmath70 is the amplitude for a neutral atom with a filled s - orbital , an electron in state @xmath74 of the metal and a hole in state @xmath75 in the metal .    as the last sector included in the above expansion eq .",
    "[ o.psi ] is @xmath76 , the accuracy of the @xmath1 expansion has been improved compared to [ i ] which only considered terms up to @xmath77 .",
    "the orthonormal basis for this two particle - hole pair sector can be written as the superposition of two amplitudes : @xmath78 the decomposition into symmetric and antisymmetric parts reflects the different ways that two electrons can move from two occupied states of the metal labeled by @xmath13 and @xmath79 to two unoccupied states labeled by @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the sector is depicted , along with all the lower order sectors , in fig .",
    "8(b ) of [ i ] .",
    "the retention of the o@xmath82 sector improves loss of memory , the experimental observation that the outgoing charge probability distribution of alkali and halogen ions is independent of the incoming charge state@xcite , but otherwise does not alter any of the results presented below qualitatively .",
    "the equations of motion are obtained by projecting the many - body schrdinger equation , @xmath83 , onto each sector of the retained hilbert space@xcite . as a practical matter",
    ", the metal is modeled by a set of @xmath84 discrete levels both above and below the fermi energy , and the fermi energy is defined to be zero .",
    "typically @xmath85 in our calculations , but we test the numerical accuracy by using larger values of @xmath84 up to @xmath86 .",
    "the states in the metal are sampled unevenly : the mesh is made much finer near the fermi energy to account for particle - hole excitations of low energy , less than @xmath87 k. to be specific , the energy levels have the following form : @xmath88,\\ \\ \\   k = 1 , 2 , \\cdots , m\\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath89 is the half - bandwidth of the metal .",
    "thus , the spacing of the energy levels close to the fermi energy is reduced from the evenly spaced energy interval of @xmath90 by a factor of @xmath91 for a typical choice of the sampling parameter @xmath92 .",
    "the density of states @xmath93 , however , is kept uniform by including compensating weights @xmath94 in all sums over the continuum of metal states @xmath13 which appear in the equations of motion for the component amplitudes",

    "non - zero temperature is incorporated by sampling excited states , weighted by the boltzmann factor .",
    "that is , at initial time @xmath31 when the atom is either far from the surface , or at the point of closest approach , the operator @xmath96^n\\ ] ] is applied to a set of random initial wavefunctions , and each resulting wavefunction is then integrated forward in time until the atom is far from the surface .",
    "observables such as the atomic occupancy are then computed , and an average over the ensemble of initial states is performed , yielding the desired thermal average . in practice",
    "only 30 random states are required to yield accurate results .",
    "we first compare the @xmath1 expansion with the nca approach in the @xmath0 limit . then we study the more realistic case of finite @xmath5 ev which describes a scattered calcium atom .",
    "we begin by considering an alkaline - earth atom initially in equilibrium close to the surface . at time @xmath31",
    "it leaves the surface at constant perpendicular velocity @xmath35 , and we follow the charge transfer along the outgoing trajectory . for the purpose of comparing with previous work ,",
    "the atom - surface system is modeled with the same parameters as those employed by snl@xcite . by setting @xmath97",
    "we obtain the pure image shift of the level : @xmath98 with the image plane positioned as it should be for a cu surface : @xmath99 a.u . away from the jellium edge .",
    "the energy of the atomic level far from the surface is set to @xmath100 ev above the fermi energy .",

    "[ fig1 ] should be compared with the _ neutral _ occupancies plotted in fig . 4 of snl@xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the final positive fractions decrease with increasing degeneracy factor @xmath10 .",
    "this is as expected from static calculations . for a fixed atomic position ,",
    "the spectral weight right above the fermi energy is enhanced as the degeneracy of the atomic level is increased , reducing the occupied fraction below the fermi energy .",

    "[ fig1 ] is a breakdown in linearity in @xmath9 and @xmath4 cases in contrast to the spinless @xmath3 case .",
    "although a similar upturn at high velocities is found within the nca approach , the effect here is quantitatively smaller .",
    "snl@xcite explain the upturn as a non - adiabatic effect due to the existence of two time scales in the problem , a slow time scale set by the kondo temperature and a rapid time scale set by the level width .",
    "another interesting feature in the figure is the convergence of the @xmath9 and @xmath4 yields to the spinless @xmath3 yield at the lowest perpendicular velocities . as the velocity",
    "is decreased the freezing distance moves outwards and eventually the atom attains the empty orbital regime . in this regime the many - body and the independent particle solutions agree as the effect of the electron - electron interaction is negligible .",
    "we would not expect the @xmath1 expansion to give accurate results at @xmath3 . yet in the static case it has been demonstrated@xcite that the @xmath1 expansion is surprisingly accurate even down to @xmath3 . in contrast , the nca approach retains spurious remnants of the kondo peak in the spectral density of the impurity at @xmath3 . the breakdown in nca , an approximate solution which sums up a selected set of @xmath77 diagrams , can be attributed to the neglect of vertex corrections@xcite which are one order higher , o(@xmath8 ) .",

    "the surface is heated locally by the formation of particle - hole pairs during the atom - surface interaction .",
    "heating is greater in the case of the incoming positive ion as it induces a larger number of particle - hole pairs than an incoming neutral atom , because in both cases the atom emerges largely neutral .",

    "anomalously strong temperature dependence remains , although absolute yields differ somewhat from those obtained in the @xmath0 limit .",
    "experimental detection of this effect may be possible , but several conditions must be satisfied .",
    "first , kinetic energy deposited in the lattice during the atom - surface impact must remain largely decoupled from the electronic degrees of freedom , otherwise the electrons in the surface will be heated and mask the kondo effect .",
    "furthermore , both the parallel and perpendicular components of the velocity must be kept small to avoid smearing the fermi surface in the reference frame of the atom .",
    "thus @xmath172 ; for @xmath159k this translates to @xmath173 a.u . in the case of a cu(001 )",
    "surface . as final fractions smaller than @xmath174",
    "are difficult to detect experimentally , it is important to choose the surface workfunction carefully .",
    "we considered the specific case of ca hitting cu(001 ) , but yields can be increased by using different metallic surfaces with larger workfunctions . finally , local heating of the surface in the form of particle - hole excitations produced as a by - product of charge transfer between the atom and the surface will mask the kondo effect .",
    "heating the surface , rather than cooling it , appears to be the best way to probe the anomalous temperature dependence , the cleanest signature of the kondo effect .",
