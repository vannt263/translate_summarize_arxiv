    "one of the dynamic reconfiguration processes of the magnetosphere is called substorm and is a key process responsible for the energy transport and release in the terrestrial magnetosphere .",
    "it is believed that reconnection is responsible for the break of stability in the magnetospheric configuration and also for the transfer from magnetic to kinetic energy , e.g. @xcite . during this process",
    "the magnetic field forms a so - called x - line surrounded by the diffusion region , where acceleration of particles takes place . in the diffusion region",
    "the electric field accelerates high - energy ions and electrons away from the magnetic reconnection region and electrons at low - energy flow toward the reconnection site simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the energetic particles are released as bursty bulk flows and are widely studied by e.g. @xcite .",
    "the bursty bulk flows often contain structures with closed magnetic field lines  plasmoids .",
    "such a large tailward - moving loop - like magnetic structure is generated as the result of x - type reconnection on the closed field lines in the near magnetotail @xcite . in two dimensions",
    "the typical observational signatures of a plasmoid have been defined by a bipolar magnetic deflection in the meridional direction .",
    "the examination of the three - dimensional topology and morphology of plasmoids in the earth s magnetotail showed rather complicated configurations compared to the original 2-dimensional hones scenario : helical flux ropes and travelling compression regions ( tcrs ) detected as moving magnetic imprints of a plasmoid in the lobes @xcite .",
    "a tailward moving plasmoid in the central plasma sheet temporarily compresses the magnetic flux in the tail lobes because the cross - sectional area of the lobe is reduced . in the area between the central plasma sheet and lobe a layer of particles moving parallel to the magnetic field",
    "arises from a rapid change of the flux tube volume outside the diffusion region @xcite .",
    "however , these field - aligned beams could also be of a different origin than reconnection , e.g. due to fermi acceleration @xcite . thus in the terrestrial magnetosphere",
    "two distinct groups of field - aligned beams can be derived : + ( 1 ) field - aligned ion beams accompanied with field - aligned electrons and associated with the x - line reconnection ; + ( 2 ) ion field - aligned beams accompanied by isotropic electrons accelerated by the quasi - steady dawn - dusk electric field .",
    "substorm - like ( or ) reconfiguration processes have been observed at jupiter by the particle and fields instruments onboard the galileo spacecraft @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the reconfiguration processes in the jovian magnetosphere are rather internally driven by ion mass loading from the moon io and fast planetary rotation , although we can not fully exclude the influence of the solar wind @xcite .",
    "this internal driving mechanism leads to a periodic release of plasma in the magnetotail with a repetition period of about 3 days .",
    "the thinning of the plasma sheet prior to the mass release reminds the growth phase of the terrestrial substorm @xcite .",
    "this plasma sheet reconfiguration due to internal energy loading leads to a formation of the x - line in the jovian magnetotail at approximately 80 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the scale size of downtail released plasmoids was estimated to be about 9 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "reconnection processes at jupiter seem to play an important role in the reconfiguration process as reported by @xcite .",
    "reconnection conditions in the jovian magnetotail are satisfied just before the energetic particle release @xcite .",
    "statistical studies of bursty bulk flows and plasmoids were carried out by @xcite . also data from the new horizons spacecraft during",
    "the jupiter flyby showed evidence of periodic plasma injections possibly caused by reconnection @xcite .",
    "some field - aligned beams were discussed in the substorm - like context by @xcite . in this paper , we show for the first time observations of a tcr and plasmoids together with field - aligned beams and consider their features more detailed in the context of x - line reconnection using data from the galileo energetic particle detector ( epd ) @xcite and from the magnetometer ( mag ) @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:1 ] we introduce shortly the instruments onboard galileo used to identify field - aligned beam features in the measurements . in section [ scene ]",
    "we present a typical jovian reconfiguration event with field - aligned beams and dynamic processes preceding and following the beam . in sections",
    "[ timing]-[event:4 ] we show examples of four field - aligned beams and their wide spectrum of characteristics .",
    "section [ discussion ] discusses results and provides a statistical analysis .",
    "section [ summary ] summarizes the observations .",
    "the epd was an instrument onboard the galileo spacecraft designed to measure the characteristics of the charged particle population such as energies , intensities , ion composition and angular distribution to determine , in particular , the configuration of the jovian magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "the advantages of the epd instrument compared to similar instruments on previous missions were the @xmath1 steradian angular coverage for jovian energetic particles and the extended coverage of particle energies .",
    "epd consisted of two double - headed detector telescopes : the low energy magnetospheric measurement system ( lemms ) and the composition measurement system ( cms ) .",
    "cms measured the ion fluxes with discriminating ion species using the time - of - flight technique .",
    "its energy ranges were 80 to 1250 kev ( protons ) , 27 kev / nuc to 1 mev / nuc ( helium ions ) , 12 to 562 kev / nuc ( oxygen ions ) , and 16 to 310 kev / nuc ( sulfur ions ) .",
    "on the other hand , lemms observed the electron flux in the energy range between 15 and 11000 kev and the species - integrated ion flux between 22 and 12400 kev . in this case",
    "electrons and ions were separated by a permanent magnet .",
    "although these telescopes have narrow field - of - view ( the full opening angles are 18@xmath2 and 15@xmath2 for cms and lemms , respectively ) , an almost full - sphere coverage is achieved by the motion of a turntable combined with the spacecraft spin ( the exception is a small solid angle ( @xmath3 0.1 sr ) along the spin axis which is blocked to avoid direct sun light in the detector ) .",
    "the unit sphere is divided into 16 ( see figure 6.2 , in @xcite ) or 6 sectors dependent on the energy channel . to study the flow direction",
    "we analyze 16-sector resolution data in this work .",
    "data are accumulated within sampling times of @xmath411.5 min ( for this study ) and allocated to the angular sectors .",
    "each sector is @xmath545@xmath2 wide . in the record time mode epd",
    "/ lemms count rates are sampled every 1.25 seconds over up to 64 sectors .",
    "the description of lemms and cms energy channels used in our analysis one can find in table [ t2le ] .",
    "the first order anisotropies were calculated using technique described by @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the pitch angle distributions ( pad ) are presented in the detector frame  detector pitch angles ( dpa ) .",
    "the flow is parallel to the magnetic field when dpa is close to 180@xmath6 and respectively anti - parallel when dpa is close to 0@xmath6 .",
    "particle pitch angles are determined with the magnetic field data obtained by the galileo magnetometer .",
    "we discuss pitch angles only when the magnetic field direction varies insignificantly during a sampling time , since otherwise the pitch angle determination is unreliable .",
    "the magnetic field observations have a time resolution of @xmath424 s , which is much higher than that of the particle measurements .",
    "this does not affect our results , however , as we compare the observed field - aligned beams in the particle data with features in the magnetic field and not the other way around .",
    "still , it is very likely that we miss many events with time scales less than 11 min in the epd data set .",
    "a typical substorm - like or reconfiguration event in the jovian magnetosphere is shown in figure [ 15 ] .",
    "the figure shows the time interval from day 1997 151 , 06:00 to day 154 , 02:00 . during this time galileo",
    "was located in the midnight sector of the jovian magnetotail ( 0116 local time ( lt ) ) at about a radial distance r = 100 @xmath7 the upper panel displays omnidirectional ion intensities in seven energy channels covering the energy range between 22 kev ( a1 channel ) and 3.2 mev ( a7 channel ) .",
    "the second panel from the top shows the radial ( red ) and azimuthal ( green ) component of the ion directional flow anisotropy as derived from measurements of 65 - 120 kev ions .",
    "the lower two panels present the magnitude and components of the measured magnetic field in the siii - system . in this system",
    "the radial magnetic field component is positive in the radially outward direction , the azimuthal component is positive in the direction of jupiter s rotation and the south - north ( meridional ) component is positive southward @xcite .",
    "first signatures of a mass - release process are observed at day 152 , 07:00 with an unusual ( for the lobe region ) increase of the ion intensities ( see vertical dashed line ( 1 ) in figure [ 15 ] ) .",
    "the corotational flow , typical for the jovian magnetosphere ( see the ion anisotropy denoted by the green line in the second panel from the top ) is disrupted by a strong tailward ( radially outward ) directed anisotropy spike or an field - aligned ion beam ( the red line ) in the lobe / psbl ( that the beam is field - aligned will be proven later ) .",
    "this is followed by the bursty flow ion anisotropy event or bursty bulk flow ( denoted by the vertical dashed line ( 2 ) ) which arrives with bipolar features in the south - north magnetic field component at day 152 , 10:00 when galileo approached the vicinity of the current sheet center .",
    "about 16 hours later another group of tailward directed bursts with similar characteristics arrives ( see vertical dashed lines ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in figure [ 15 ] ) .",
    "then in the subsequent plasma sheet encounter radially inward directed bursts ( the negative red spikes ) are observed implying that the x - line moved tailward over the spacecraft .",
    "the observations of the flow reversals are very typical for the jovian magnetotail , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that just before the bursty flows the plasma sheet changed its displacement relative to the spacecraft from being more in the southern part of the plasma sheet to being in the northern part of the plasma sheet almost all of the presented time ( according to the radial magnetic field component behavior ) .",
    "such plasma sheet displacements were discussed by @xcite .",
    "they suggest that these displacements could be associated to a change in the solar wind conditions .",
    "more details on the reconfiguration or substorm - like events can be found in @xcite .",
    "this example is shown to present the global picture of the magnetotail dynamics before going into details .",
    "one example of a field - aligned beam during reconfiguration events is shown in figure [ 15 ] .",
    "it was recorded at 100 @xmath0 away from the planet in the magnetotail , on day 97 152 , 06:30 - 09:00 . the detailed particle and the magnetic field observations for this event are presented in figure [ 152 ] and the location relative to the plasma sheet configuration is sketched in figure [ scetch ] .",
    "according to the strength and direction of the magnetic field the spacecraft was located in the north lobe / or psbl .",
    "first the electrons arrive with energies from 15 to 304 kev ( see electron intensities in figure [ 152 ] , panel 1 ) at 0659 ut .",
    "these electrons were flowing parallel to the magnetic field in the lobe region ( see the increase in electron intensities close to 180@xmath6 in dpa distributions , panel 4 ) .",
    "after 0659 ut electrons moved bi - directionally parallel to the magnetic field ( see the increase in intensities close to 0@xmath6 and 180@xmath6 ) . between 0710 ut and 0750 ut",
    "the observed electrons changed their direction of motion from being anti - parallel 0710 - 0721 ut to mainly parallel 0721 - 0750 ut relatively to the magnetic field . at 0750 ut",
    "the electron distribution becomes isotropic .",
    "this field - aligned electron beam is associated with the reconfiguration event from the list published by @xcite . after the field - aligned beam was observed the plasma sheet center moved towards galileo ( see section [ scene ] , figure [ 15 ] ) . as it is expected from the reconnection scenario the bulk release of particles (",
    "see vertical dashed line ( 2 ) in figure [ 15 ] ) at the alfvnic speed is observed at 1200 ut on day 152 , as studied by @xcite . from the comparison of the flow speed of the bursty bulk",
    "flows was compared with the alfvn speed .",
    "we can assume that during this time the reconnection process was ongoing and that the electron beam has possibly been mirrored at the next x - point as in a magnetic bottle bouncing between two mirror points on loop field lines ( i.e. multiple x - line formation is assumed , see also kasahara et al .",
    ", submitted to jgr ) or launched from another x - line .",
    "also the bi - directional streaming electrons are commonly observed in the terrestrial plasma sheet boundary layers @xcite .",
    "ions arrived at least 11 min later at 0710 ut .",
    "the third panel of figure [ 152 ] shows the first order directional anisotropy components of ions ( 65 - 120 kev ) in radial and azimuthal directions . during this event the ions moved clearly predominantly radially outward with an anti - corotational component .",
    "those ions moved also along the magnetic field direction as indicated in the pitch angle distributions ( panel 5 of figure [ 152 ] ) .",
    "ion fluxes exhibit an energy dispersion in the sense that the intensities of high energy ions increase first .",
    "assuming that the electrons have a single source ( e.g. released at the reconnection site during the onset phase ) , the distance from galileo to the source ( e.g. the reconnection line ) can be roughly estimated from the delay time between different species .",
    "we must point out that the time resolution of the epd data is 11 minutes and therefore the following calculations have large error bars .",
    "ions measured in the a1 channel ( 42 - 65 kev ) , mainly protons , with a geometric mean energy of 52 kev ( speed of @xmath4 3200 km s@xmath8 ) arrive @xmath4 22 min later than electrons .",
    "this gives a distance of 60 @xmath9 30 @xmath7 according to these calculations the distance from the source to galileo was between 30 @xmath0 and 90 @xmath0 .",
    "consequently a source would be located at @xmath4 40 @xmath9 30 @xmath0 from the planet .",
    "the source location is slightly closer to the planet than those derived by @xcite but still similar within the error bar .",
    "even if the delay calculations are rough , this event presents an energy dispersion of different particles : electrons arrive first , and then high energy ions followed later by lower energy ions .",
    "this implies a single source of these field - aligned beams .",
    "one can claim that the observed dispersion is related to gyroradius effect or gradient effects .",
    "we estimate the gyroperiod of the proton of @xmath49 s in this magnetic environment .",
    "we see that the accumulation time of 11 min is much longer than the proton gyroperiod .",
    "additionally , the spacecraft passes 0.002 @xmath0 during one accumulation time of the epd instrument ( the galileo speed is @xmath43.2@xmath1010@xmath11 @xmath12 ) .",
    "this distance is the same order of magnitude as the proton gyroradius of a field - aligned beam .",
    "therefore , the spacecraft could be considered basically stationary relative to the ion motion .",
    "the ion dispersion is also not related to @xmath13 drift , as they would lead to much longer time delays .",
    "another field - aligned beam was observed during the reconfiguration event on doy 153 at 0620 and is shown by vertical dashed line ( 3 ) in figure [ 15 ] .",
    "details are presented in figure [ 153 ] in the same format as for event 1 in figure [ 152 ] . during this beam significant increases by more than one order of magnitude of the ion intensities ( 42 kev to 1.7 mev ) and by one order of magnitude of the electron intensities ( 15 to 304 kev )",
    "are observed .",
    "again , the first order flow anisotropy shows that the ions during this event were flowing radially outward in anti - corotational direction .",
    "location of this event relative to the plasma sheet configuration is sketched in figure [ scetch ] .",
    "the meridional magnetic field component @xmath14 becomes negative at 0625 ut ( northward directed ) suggesting a tailward flow in the plasma sheet @xcite in case of a neutral line formation . at the same time",
    "the field - aligned electrons followed by the field - aligned ions ( arrived later at 0636 ut ) are observed .",
    "the delays between electrons and ions are the same as in the example in section [ timing ] suggesting similar nature of the field - aligned beam . at @xmath40640",
    "ut a signature of a flux rope or tcr is seen in the magnetic field , i.e. increase in the radial magnetic field component , bipolar signature in the meridional magnetic field component . additionally , the disappearance of the anti - phase signature between the azimuthal and radial magnetic field components as in usual quiet configuration ( @xmath15 reaching zero ) is observed .",
    "the flux rope - like magnetic field ( increased radial magnetic field component together with the bipolar signature in the meridional magnetic field component , see e.g. , @xcite ) is associated with ion field - aligned beam parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the proton intensity increased by almost 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "after the flux - rope structure decaying oscillations in the meridional magnetic field component are observed .",
    "these oscillations could indicate small scale magnetic islands ( probably created by magnetic reconnection ) , or they are imprints of the post - plasmoid plasma sheet structure as shown in @xcite .",
    "we conclude that these field - aligned electron and ion beams are ( 1 ) associated with tcr mentioned as a reconnection event in the study of @xcite , ( 2 ) followed by the bursty bulk flow reversal ( see vertical line ( 4 ) in figure [ 15 ] ) , and ( 3 ) show the energy dispersion .",
    "all these features imply that the observed field - aligned electron and ion beams are associated with a reconnection process .",
    "another example of field - aligned particle beams is shown in figure [ 283 ] observed on day 1996 283 from 1100 to 1500 ut . during this time galileo",
    "was located in the pre - dawn sector of the magnetotail ( 03:19 lt ) at r = 113 @xmath7 location of this event relative to the plasma sheet configuration is sketched in figure [ scetch ] .",
    "these field - aligned beams preceded the bursty bulk flows in the reconfiguration event from the list by @xcite .",
    "the first order flow anisotropy shows that the ions during this event flow radially outward in anti - corotational direction . here again the dispersion is observed . at @xmath41151 ut , a bi - directional , field - aligned electron flow ( 29 to 42 kev ) arrival was observed ( seen in the dpa distribution ) .",
    "then at @xmath41214 ut the electron flux was mono - directional field - aligned and changed to bi - directional field - aligned again between @xmath41225 and @xmath41259 ut . simultaneously with this strong electron beam ( in our time resolution ) protons with energies from 220 to 540 kev arrived at @xmath41214 ut . at @xmath41225 ut the field - aligned ions with energies of 65 - 120 kev and protons ( 80 to 220 kev ) followed by oxygen ( 26 to 51 kev / nuc ) arrived at @xmath41248 ut and eventually sulfur ( 16 to 30 kev / nuc ) at @xmath41236 ut . assuming that the x - line as the source of all these flows , this scenario can be checked . as the arrival of the electrons is not clearly determined , we estimate the distance x to the x - line using the formula @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the sulfur speed and @xmath18 is the proton speed , @xmath19 is the time delay between the arrival of protons and sulfur @xmath423 min .",
    "we obtain the distance from galileo to the x - line equal to 52@xmath20 26 @xmath0 .",
    "this also agrees with the statistical x - line derived by @xcite . for the given location it is approximately at 70 @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it is likely that particles were released from a single extended source and the time - of - flight dispersion theory works and the presented example fits the x - line reconnection scenario .",
    "it is not likely that gyroradius effects and gradient effects influence the results for this event , as the magnetic field during the field - aligned beam was stable and the spacecraft was approximately at the same position in the lobe region .",
    "we also note that this event was not considered as a reconnection event by @xcite .",
    "figure [ hr ] presents an event on doy 235 of 1997 showing the spacial structure of the electron beam . during this event galileo",
    "was located in the pre - dawn sector of the magnetotail ( 00:56 lt ) at r = 129.9 @xmath7 as the particle data were acquired with the full time resolution in this particular period , we see the covered pitch angle and the associated particle flux due to the instrument rotation . the magnetic field is plotted in siii coordinate system .",
    "galileo was located southward of the current sheet center during most of this period .",
    "anti - parallel field - aligned electron beam is observed in several channels ( 15 to 188 kev ) , from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ut ( see in dpa distributions as red dots close to 0@xmath6 ) .",
    "the beam almost disappeared during 1427 - 1429 ut , indicating that this is the intermittent and/or localized beam .",
    "this beam is associated with the bipolar signatures in the meridional magnetic field component at @xmath41420 ut .",
    "this event shows a mono - directional electron beam , consistent with an x - line planetward of the galileo spacecraft .",
    "the field - aligned ion beam is seen at energies 65 - 120 kev and 42 - 65 kev during 1443 - 1455 ut . during the neutral sheet approaching at around 1443 - 1455 ut ,",
    "electron flux is enhanced by a factor of @xmath42 compare to the period at @xmath41420 - 1435 ut in the plasma sheet boundary layer , the particle distribution is isotropic .",
    "the fluxes in the plasma sheet are higher compared to those at the boundary layer .",
    "all these suggests a closed field line topology @xcite . an unambiguous evidence of the beam layer structure is seen .",
    "namely , the electron beam propagates at the outer edge of the thin current sheet and an isotropic distribution is observed around the current sheet center .",
    "this can not be clearly evidenced by low - resolution data due to the ambiguous pitch angle determination around the magnetic field reversal .",
    "the field - aligned beam is preceded by the plasmoids and associated with the magnetic field dipolarization .",
    "the meridional magnetic field component is already negative before ( unfortunately the particle data are not available in that resolution before @xmath41408 ut ) .",
    "therefore , there could be a formation of a large plasmoid or post plasmoid plasma sheet followed by smaller asymmetric plasmoid ( at @xmath41414 ut ) and dipolarization ( at @xmath41420 ut ) characterized by a strong and steep increase of the meridional magnetic field component , preceded by a much less negative dip , as in the terrestrial cases observed and simulated by e.g. @xcite .",
    "this bipolar change of the meridian magnetic field component followed by a dipolarization front can also be explained to be caused by the tailward movement of reconnection site , followed further by dipolarization of the magnetic field at planetward side of reconnection site . during the plasmoid passage ,",
    "the neutral sheet crossing took place during between 1414 and 1416 ut and no electron flux enhancement was observed .",
    "this is different from the terrestrial case where the plasmoids centers are associated with increases in the electron flux @xcite .",
    "an approximate location of the spacecraft trajectory relative to the plasma sheet configuration , between 14:00 and 14:18 ut , is sketched in figure [ scetch ] .",
    "in the previous section we presented examples of the field - aligned electron and ion beams in energetic particle data measured onboard the galileo spacecraft in the jovian magnetotail .",
    "we investigated the galileo orbits g2 , e6 , g8 , c9 , c10 and e16 , searched for such field - aligned beams and found 30 events .",
    "for these events we required : + ( 1 ) observation during more than one accumulation time ( that excludes spikes due to instrumental effects ) ; + ( 2 ) the radial flow anisotropy dominates the corotational one and + ( 3 ) the ion pitch angle distributions show that the particle flow is predominantly parallel / anti - parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the distribution of these events in the jovian magnetosphere along the galileo orbits is shown in figure [ map ] .",
    "it is possible that due to the low time resolution of the epd instrument many field - aligned beams were not detected .",
    "we listed the duration of the field - aligned beams in table [ events ] , which is on average 55.6 minutes .",
    "statistically most events have a duration between 20 and 40 minutes ( see the occurrence rate of field - aligned beams versus its duration in figure [ hist ] ) .",
    "the distribution of events versus duration time confirms that it is likely that many field - aligned beams have shorter duration than 20 minutes .",
    "all 30 field - aligned beams investigated in this study are associated with those 34 jovian reconfiguration events listed in @xcite . during 15 of them",
    "we observe the field - aligned beams . during 8 of these 15 events",
    "several field - aligned beams are seen .",
    "these field - aligned beams seem to be a constituent part of the jovian reconfiguration process . in figure [ map ]",
    "we show the location of the x - lines derived by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the field - aligned beams are concentrated close to these lines .",
    "therefore , we believe that the field - aligned beams are signatures of reconnection , which occur during the reconfiguration in the jovian magnetotail",
    ". now we would like to estimate the mass and energy input of the field - aligned beams in the content of the jovian energy budget .",
    "the mass which carries a field - aligned beam can be estimated as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a typical number density in the jovian magnetotail @xcite .",
    "we assume that oxygen is the average ion contained in the jovian plasma sheet . the volume , @xmath25 of the field - aligned beam can be assessed as the length of the beam @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the field - aligned beam speed and @xmath28 is the duration , multiplied with the assumed vertical extent 1 @xmath0 and the azimuthal extent 25 @xmath0 . as average speed of the field - aligned beam we use the speed of the ions in the plasma sheet boundary layers , 800 km s@xmath8 derived by @xcite and as duration we take an average duration of the field - aligned beam derived above , @xmath460 min .",
    "therefore , the mass release during one field - aligned beam is in the order of 100 tons .",
    "this is lower compared to the mass of plasmoids derived by @xcite , 800 tons and 2500 tons , respectively .",
    "the kinetic energy of the field - aligned beam can be evaluated from the formula @xmath29 this will lead to @xmath30j . therefore , the power of the field - aligned beam will be in the order of 9 tw , for an averaged duration of the beam of @xmath460 min .",
    "this power will be enough to supply for instance jovian polar auroral emissions , see ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we investigated the events in the psbl or lobe regions . according to the x - type reconnection scenario by @xcite , we observe the field - aligned electron and ion beams in the psbl . in the paper of @xcite , two types of electron distribution",
    "are reported : ( 1 ) when the electrons are isotropic and ( 2 ) when electrons flow along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the first case is associated with the non - adiabatic acceleration by the quasi - steady dawn - dusk electric field and is not necessary associated with substorm - like activity .",
    "the beams of the second type are usually generated close to the x - line .",
    "we check the distribution of the particle flux in the three directions relative to the magnetic field using the dpa : anti - parallel , dpa@xmath3140@xmath32 parallel , dpa@xmath33140@xmath6 and perpendicular , 70@xmath34dpa@xmath31110@xmath6 .",
    "we would like to note that due to the plasma corotation in the jovian plasma sheet , many of the field - aligned flows will still have quite a substantial corotational component .",
    "this is reflected in the pitch angle distributions as an increased perpendicular component .",
    "23 events with field - aligned ion beams are associated with anisotropic electrons , i.e. which flow along the magnetic field and 13 of them are associated with reconnection events studied by @xcite derived from the magnetometer data .",
    "the characteristics of the field - aligned ion beams are seen in table [ events ] .",
    "the propagation of the ions and electrons parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field confirm the quadrupolar x - line configuration , see figure [ scetch ] .",
    "slightly more than half of the field - aligned beams are associated with reconnection events observed by @xcite .",
    "why not more ? the reasons could be ( 1 ) different arrival times of field - aligned beams and plasmoids ; ( 2 ) the field - aligned beams are mainly located in the lobe region where reconnection signatures might be smoothed . in 7 cases",
    "field - aligned ion beams are associated with the isotropic electron distribution , see table [ events ] .",
    "therefore , they might be accelerated not at the x - line .",
    "most of these events , namely 5 , has no association with the reconnection events from @xcite .",
    "this is expected .",
    "\\(1 ) we presented two examples ( event 1 , event 3 ) of the counterstreaming electron beams in the plasma sheet boundary layers . according to @xcite",
    "the counterstreaming electron beams occur due to the bouncing between two mirror points on closed field lines in the plasma sheet .",
    "they could also occur due to the travelling of electrons between multiple x - lines .",
    "( 2 ) most of the field - aligned ion events are associated with the field - aligned electron beams which according to @xcite are related to electron acceleration in the x - line vicinity .",
    "( 3 ) the timing of the arrival of the field - aligned beams for the different species in many events ( e.g. event 1 , event 2 , event 3 ) is in accordance to the time - dispersion when the source is at one point / line @xcite .",
    "also @xcite observed the time dispersion of the energetic ions of different species using data from new horizons .",
    "( 4 ) observations of all types of the plasma release from plasmoid or flux rope , its imprint in the psbl  tcr and dipolarization are in accordance to the reconnection theory and all are associated with the electron and ion field - aligned beams ( event 2 , event 3 , event 4 ) .",
    "( 5 ) we show evidence that the electron beam propagates in the psbl while isotropic distribution is observed around the current sheet center ( event 4 ) .",
    "( 6 ) observations of the flow reversals in 53@xmath35 of the jovian reconfiguration events from @xcite imply x - line crossing , see an example in section [ scene ] , figure [ 15 ] .",
    "( 7 ) all field - aligned beams are associated with the jovian reconfiguration events .",
