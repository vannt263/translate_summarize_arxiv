    "pion production reactions induced by neutrinos are very interesting as a means to study hadronic structure . besides",
    ", they have become very relevant in the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments where pion production contributes to the background .",
    "most previous studies@xcite of pion production processes at intermediate energies considered only the delta pole ( @xmath3 ) mechanism ( see fig.[fig : diagramas ] ) . here",
    ", we shall also include background terms required by chiral symmetry .",
    "some background terms have been included before in the works of ref.@xcite although they are not fully consistent with chiral counting rules .",
    "for charged current ( cc ) processes our model includes all contributions depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagramas ] .",
    "we have the @xmath3 terms and background terms which include nucleon - pole terms ( @xmath4 ) , contact term ( @xmath5 ) , pion - pole term ( @xmath6 ) , and pion in flight term ( @xmath7 ) . for that purpose",
    "we use a su(2 ) nonlinear @xmath8model with nucleon and pion degrees of freedom . on top of the vertices and currents provided by this model",
    "we include phenomenological form factors for the weak @xmath9 vertex that we take from the work of ref.@xcite . a different form factor is included in the purely axial @xmath6 term to account for the @xmath10meson dominance of the @xmath11 vertex .",
    "vector current conservation ( cvc ) and partial conservation of the axial current ( pcac ) require the introduction of corresponding form factors in the @xmath7 term , and the vector and axial parts of the @xmath5 term .",
    "the weak nucleon - delta vertex is parametrized in terms of four vector and four axial form factors@xcite .",
    "we use the set of vector form factors of ref.@xcite determined from the analysis of photo and electroproduction data .",
    "initially we shall take the set of axial form factors in ref.@xcite . in this latter work adler s model@xcite",
    "is used to fix @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while @xmath14 is obtained from @xmath15 by pcac .",
    "for @xmath15 they use the parameterization @xmath16 @xmath17 corresponds to the value obtained from the @xmath18 coupling constant using the off - diagonal goldberger - treiman relation .",
    "we shall call this set i. due to the lack of space we can not give a full account of our model and all the results we have obtained .",
    "interested readers can find all the relevant information in ref.@xcite .",
    "in the top left panel of fig.[fig : neutrino ] we show the flux - averaged @xmath0-differential @xmath19 cross section @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the invariant mass of the final hadronic state .",
    "the inclusion of the background terms spoils the agreement with anl data if set i is used .",
    "the least well known ingredients of the model are the axial nucleon - delta form factors , of which @xmath15 gives the largest contribution .",
    "this strongly suggests a new fit of @xmath15 to the anl experimental data . keeping the parameterization in eq.([eq : c5a ] ) we obtain the new values @xmath22 that we shall call set ii .",
    "the new @xmath23 value is some 30% smaller than the commonly assumed one , but it is not in contradiction with a recent lattice determination@xcite . in the panel we also show a 68% confidence level band deduced from the statistical errors quoted above . in the rest of the panels",
    "we show the results for different cc and neutral current ( nc ) driven processes . in all of them",
    "the background terms give sizeable contributions .",
    "the use of set ii of axial nucleon - delta form factor increase the overall agreement with data .    for the neutrino induced cc processes we also show bnl data@xcite which seem to favor a larger @xmath23 value . for antineutrino",
    "induced cc processes we see our full model calculation with set ii gives the best results but it is still larger than the experimental data obtained at cern@xcite . a recent calculation@xcite claims that medium and pion absorption effects can perfectly explain this discrepancy between theoretical results on the nucleon and antineutrino experimental data actually measured in a freon - propane target .",
    "the last three panels of fig  [ fig : neutrino ] show results for nc processes .",
    "the isovector contributions to these can be obtained directly from the cc ones using isospin symmetry .",
    "besides , there are two different isoscalar contributions , one given in terms of the isoscalar part of the electromagnetic current and another one related to the @xmath24 content of the nucleon .",
    "both are of the @xmath4 type and their expressions and the form factors used in this case are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "our full model using set ii reproduces fairly well the experimental results for @xmath25 .",
    "the bottom left panel shows our results results are not sensitive to the @xmath24 content of the nucleon .",
    "last panel serves two purposes .",
    "first , it exemplifies the fact that antineutrino induced nc processes are suppressed with respect to neutrino induced ones , and second , it shows there is little isovector - isoscalar interference .",
    "in fact the isovector contribution is dominant .",
