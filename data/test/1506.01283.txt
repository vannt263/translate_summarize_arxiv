    "polarization charges are induced at the surface - region of the bulk .",
    "they result in an attractive image potential that can bind the electrons perpendicularly to the surface .    since the first substantiation of image potential states by 2ppe in 1985 @xcite , it is nowadays the experimental method of choice for such investigations .",
    "ips play a decisive role as model systems to study fundamental decay processes of excited electrons .",
    "extensive research has been conducted on clean metal surfaces @xcite , rare gas adlayers on different metallic substrates @xcite , and organic thin films on metal surfaces @xcite .",

    "image potential states of clean metal surfaces can be described using the so called bulk penetration model .",
    "starting point for this model is that the decay processes of electrons in ips are influenced by their interaction with bulk electrons @xcite .",
    "simply speaking , the larger the lifetime of an electron in an ips is the lower is the penetration of its wavefunction into the bulk , and vice versa .",
    "in addition , one has to consider the influence of the long - ranging coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "it influences the available phase space for decay processes strongly .",

    "only a few 2ppe investigations on metal oxides have been reported whereas none of these investigations focus on the image potential states @xcite . here",

    "the dynamics of the ips directly reflect the coupling to unoccupied nio thin film states . with our investigations on nio , the knowledge about image potential states can be extended to the region in between highly polarizable metal surfaces and insulating adlayers .",
    "sample preparation and all experiments have been performed in an ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) chamber working at a base pressure of @xmath0 mbar .",
    "the chamber is equipped with an optics for low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) , an x - ray source for x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) as well as a uv source for ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( ups ) .",
    "the photoemitted electrons are detected by a hemispherical analyzer ( phoibos 150 , specs , germany ) which contains a ccd detector for simultaneous recording of electron energy and emission angle . for 2ppe",

    "are combined with infrared ( ir ) laser pulses ( 1.681.72 ev ) and have typical pulse lengths of 5090 fs and 3545 fs , respectively .",
    "the ag(001 ) crystal was cleaned by several cycles of ar ion sputtering and subsequent annealing at 600 k until no contamination could be detected by xps .",
    "nio ultrathin films have been grown via molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) as established by marre and neddermeyer @xcite .",

    "while the spectra for 2 and 4 ml are similar and even bulk - like in shape @xcite , the spectrum for 1 ml nio / ag(001 ) differs significantly : the maximum of the ni @xmath7 peak appears with a difference of 1.4 ev at lower binding energy , and the satellite structure is differently shaped in comparison to the spectra for higher coverages .",

    "the difference of 50 mev for the ( n=1 ) ips and 70 mev for the ( n=2 ) ips is close to the uncertainty of the measurement .",

    "compared to the annealed samples , the binding energies of the ips of the as prepared sample as well as the workfunction are approximately 250 mev lower .",

    "therefore , they are affected by the _ local _ workfunction of the flat nio regions . since the intermediate state energies of the ips do not change for the as prepared and annealed nio bilayer , the local workfunction does not change for both preparations . due to an enhanced film quality upon annealing the nio bilayer ,",

    "the 12 fs longer lifetime for the 2 ml film annealed to 540 k ( b ) in comparison to the as prepared 2 ml ( a ) is explained by the higher film quality upon annealing . as known from other systems @xcite , the electron dynamics strongly depend on defect and step densities . these densities are reduced upon annealing and lead to a reduced non - momentum conserving scattering . for the annealed oxide films , the quality of the layers of different thicknesses as determined by the sharpness of the leed spots ( cf . fig .",
    "[ pic : leedxps ] ( a ) ) is comparable .",
    "the film quality is significantly higher as compared to the as prepared 2 ml film .",
    "therefore , the lifetimes in the annealed films should be less limited by surface imperfections .",
    "the relaxation of an ips electron is dominantly dependent on the coupling of its wavefunction to wavefunctions of the substrate below . in our case",
    ", the latter corresponds to the electronic structure of the nio(001)/ag(001 ) thin film system . the remarkably shorter lifetime of electrons in the ( n=1 ) ips for 3 ml nio / ag(001 ) is , therefore , assigned to a stronger coupling to unoccupied nio thin film states at this specific thickness .",
    "the different ips lifetimes are , therefore , explainable by a slight modification of the electronic structure for 3 ml is slightly changed as compared to that of 2 and 4 ml thick nio films .",
    "this is also substanciated by the different binding energies of the ips for 3 ml as discussed above .",
    "the decay of the ( n=2 ) ips behaves differently for the 24 ml films .",
    "first , one finds again a longer lifetime of the annealed 2 ml film as compared to 2 ml prepared at rt .",
    "this is explained by the improved film quality upon annealing . clearly , the second ips is even more sensitive to the film quality due to its longer lifetime as compared to the ( n=1 ) ips .",
    "the ( n=2 ) ips has an additional decay channel into the ( n=1 ) ips for non - momentum conserved scattering which makes it more defect sensitive .",
    "the decay times of the ( n=2 ) ips for the nio bilayer are longer than those for the ( n=1 ) ips .",
    "this follows the general trend known from clean metals that the lifetime of an ips is increased with increasing quantum number @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the relaxation time of electrons from the ( n=2 ) ips decreases with increasing film thickness . for 4 ml",
    ", the lifetime of the ( n=2 ) ips electrons is even shorter than for electrons excited into the according ( n=1 ) ips .",
    "this differs strongly from the observations on insulating rare - gas layers with negative electron affinity ( ea ) on metals @xcite . for such systems ,",
    "the dielectric layer acts as a spacer and decouples the ips from the metal surface . due to the negative ea ,",
    "no additional electronic states of the spacer layer are introduced in the energy range of the ips .",
    "hence , the wavefunctions of the ips are pushed away from the metal surface .",
    "this results in a strong increase of the lifetimes with increasing layer thickness .",
    "the behavior of nio films is , in contrast , similar to rare - gas adlayers with ea@xmath24 . for such systems @xcite ,",
    "the energetic position of the ips is within the conduction band of the rare gas adlayers .",
    "therefore , the wavefunction of the ips can penetrate the layer . in case of bulk nio",
    ", the conduction band minimum is located at 2.6 ev above @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the ips of 24 ml nio on ag(001 ) have intermediate state energies of 3.7 ev and more and are , therefore , located in the nio conduction band .",
    "hence , the wavefunctions of the ips can couple to those of the nio thin film states .",
    "the decrease of lifetimes for the second ips from 2 ml to 4 ml nio / ag(001 ) is explained by a stronger coupling of the ips to thin film states due to an increase of the density of nio states with increasing film thickness in the energy region of the ips .    for all prepared oxide films ,",
    "the feature b occurs at an intermediate energy of 3.9 ev .",
    "this state belongs to an electronic transition caused by the silver substrate and is not discussed further here .",
    "we have investigated the image - potential states for nio(001 ) ultrathin films of 24 ml on ag(001 ) by means of angle- and time - resolved 2ppe .",
    "the first three ips were identified via their parabolic dispersion and their relatively long lifetimes .",
    "the decay of the ips depends strongly on the film quality .",
    "compared to a bilayer nio / ag(001 ) prepared at rt , an annealed 2 ml film yield a factor of 1.3 and 1.7 longer lifetimes of the first and second ips , respectively .",
    "for the first ips the lifetimes are in the range of 2742 fs and differ only slightly for annealed nio films with 24 ml thickness .",
    "in contrast , the lifetimes of the second ips decrease with increasing film thickness from 85 fs ( 2 ml ) to 33 fs ( 4 ml ) .",
    "this is explained by the introduction of additional nio thin film states in the energy range of the ips .",
    "therefore , electrons in the ips decay faster due to an increased coupling to these states .",

    "<S> these differences are discussed in terms of a coupling to the layer - dependent electronic structure of the nio ultrathin films . </S>"
