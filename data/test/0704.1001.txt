    "in this paper we present an attempt to formalize what may be called a _ string field theory ( sft ) _ for ( closed ) topological strings with hodge property .    from the very first days of string theory it was considered as a kind of generalization of the perturbative expansion of the quantum field theory in the ( functional ) integral representation .",
    "the space of graphs with @xmath0 loops with metrics on edges ( schwinger proper times ) was generalized to moduli space of riemann surfaces .",
    "indeed , the latter space really looks like a principle @xmath1 bundle over the former space near the points of maximal degeneracy ( i.e. , where maximal number of handles are pinched ) .",
    "a natural question is whether there are special string theories that degenerate exactly to quantum field theories ( may be , of the special kind ) .",
    "would it happen such theories should enjoy both finiteness of string theory and ( functional ) integral description of quantum field theory .",
    "one of the first attempts to construct a theory of this type was done by zwiebach in  @xcite .",
    "he divided the moduli space into two regions : the internal piece and the boundary .",
    "he observed that surfaces representing the boundary region may be constructed from those representing the internal piece by gluing them with the help of cylinders ( with flat metric ) .",
    "therefore , he proposed to take integrals over the moduli spaces in two steps : first , to take an integral over the internal pieces , such that this would produce vertices , and then take an integral along metrics on cylinders , that would exactly reproduce integral along the schwinger parameters on graphs in qft prescription .    in this approach , he came with the infinite number of vertices of different internal genera and with different number of external legs .",
    "however , he observed that such vertices satisfy quadratic relations that where a quantum version of some infinity - structure . at that time community of theoretical physicists seemed not to be impressed by the lagrangian with infinite number of ( almost uncomputable ) vertices .",
    "the next attempt was done by witten  @xcite .",
    "he assumed that in topological string theories there may be a limit in the space of two - dimensional theories such that the measure of integration goes to the vicinity of the points of maximal degeneration . in the type b theories",
    "such limit seems to be the large volume limit of the target space ; this motivated witten s chern - simons - like representation for the topological string theory .",
    "this approach was further developed by bershadsky , cecotti , ooguri , and vafa in  @xcite .",
    "we note that the tropical limit of gromov - witten theory  @xcite ( type a topological strings ) seems to realize the same qft degeneration of string theory .",
    "indeed , the tropical limit of a riemann surface mapped to a toric variety is represented by the graph mapped to the moment map domain .    in the development of topological string theory it became clear that the proper object is not just a measure on the moduli space of complex structures of riemann surfaces , but rather a differential form on this space . in original formulation these differential forms",
    "were assigned to the tensor algebra of cohomology of some complex ; such objects are called gromov - witten invariants .",
    "we say that gromov - witten invariants are qft - like if the differential forms of non - zero degree have support only in a vicinity of the points of maximal degeneration .",
    "we generalized the definition of gromov - witten invariants in  @xcite by lifting it from the cohomology of a complex to the full complex .",
    "such generalization involved enlargement of the moduli space from deligne - mumford space to kimura - stasheff - voronov space  @xcite , and we called it zwiebach invariants ( in fact , some pieces of this construction appeared earlier in  @xcite and  @xcite ) . the complex of states involved in the definition of zwiebach invariants is a bicomplex due to the action of the second differential .",
    "the second differential represents the substitution of a special vector field corresponding to the constant rotation of the phase of the local coordinate at a marked point into differential forms on the kimura - stasheff - voronov space .",
    "once we have some zwiebach invariants , it is possible to produce new zwiebach invariants by contraction of an acyclic hodge sub - bicomplex .",
    "in fact , it is one of the main properties of zwiebach invariants .",
    "consider a sub - bicomplex , where these two differentials act freely .",
    "we call it hodge contractible bicomplex .",
    "the operation of contraction of a hodge contractible bicomplex turns zwiebach invariants into induced zwiebach invariants on the coset with respect to contactible bicomplex .",
    "induced zwiebach invariants are differential forms whose support is a union of the support of the initial zwiebach invariants and small neighbourhoods of the points of maximal degeneration .",
    "this procedure is a generalization from intervals to cylinders of the procedure of induction of @xmath2-structures , see e.  g.  @xcite .",
    "this way we can obtain qft - like gromov - witten invariants . we just should start with zwiebach invariants that have ( in some suitable sense ) no support inside the kimura - stasheff - voronov spaces .",
    "in fact , it is even enough to consider a weaker condition , motivated by applications .",
    "that is , usually people consider the integrals of gromov - witten invarians only over the tautological classes in the moduli space of curves .",
    "so , we call a set of zwiebach invariants vertex - like if the integral over the kimura - stasheff - voronov spaces of any their non - zero component multipled by the pullback ( from the deligne - mumford space ) of any tautological class vanishes",
    ".    consider vertex - like zwiebach invariants .",
    "assume we contract a hodge contractible bicomplex down to cohomology .",
    "we obtain differential forms on the deligne - mumford space , such that the integral of the product of any such form of non - zero degree with any tautological class vanishes the interior of the moduli space .",
    "integrals of such forms over the moduli spaces turn out to be sums over graphs ( corresponding to degenerate riemann surfaces ) .",
    "they resemble feynman diagramms , and generation function for the integral over moduli spaces resemble diagrammatic expansion of perturbative quantum field theory .    in this paper",
    ", we do nt construct examples of vertex - like zwiebach invariants ( we are going to do this explicitly in a future publication , as well as the corresponding theory for the spaces introduced in  @xcite ) .",
    "rather we conjecture that they exist and study the consequences of this assumption .",
    "we call the emerging construction the _ hodge field theory _ , and now we will explain it in some detail .",
    "first of all , degree zero parts of vertex - like zwiebach invariants induce the structure of homotopy cyclic hodge algebra on the target complex  @xcite .",
    "we remind that a cyclic hodge algebra is just a hodge dgbv - algebra with one additional axiom ( @xmath3-axiom , see below ) .",
    "in fact , this structure is interesting by itself , without any reference to zwiebach invariants .",
    "it has first appeared in the paper of barannikov and kontsevich  @xcite ; it captures the properties of polyvector fields on calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "more examples of dgbv algebras are studied in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to understand the structure of dgbv - algebra as a natural generalization of the algebraic structure studied in  @xcite .    in the hodge field theory construction",
    "we consider only a particular case , where we obtain axioms of of a cyclic hodge algebra itself , not up to homotopy .",
    "we are aware of the fact that demanding existance of vertex - like zwiebach invariants simultaneously with vanishing homotopy piece of cyclic hodge algebra conditions may be too restrictive , and while considering only those relations that lead to axioms of cyclic hodge algebra may be too weak , however we proceed .    in the hodge field theory construction",
    "we define graph expressions for the analogues of gromov - witten invariants multiplied by tautological classes using _ only cyclic hodge algebra data_. we call them hodge field theory correlators .",
    "the corresponding action of the hodge field theory is written down explicitely in section  [ action ] .",
    "our main result is the proof that the hodge field theory correlators satisfy all universal equations that follow from relations among tautological classes in cohomology .",
    "the first result of this kind is due to barannikov and kontsevich .",
    "they have noticed that there is a solution of the wdvv equation that is associated to a dgbv - algebra ( this solution is the critical value of the bcov action  @xcite , see  ( * ? ? ? * appendix ) and  ( * ? ? ? * appendix ) ) .",
    "later , we reproved this in  @xcite .",
    "then , in  @xcite we proved some other low - genera universal equations . here",
    "we generalize all these result and put all calculations done before in a proper framework .    in particular",
    ", the main problem for us was to define a graph expression in tensors of a cyclic hodge algebra that corresponds to the full gromov - witten potential with descendants .",
    "the first steps were done in  @xcite , where we introduced the definition of descendants at one point in hodge field theory ( mostly for combinatorial reasons ) .",
    "but then we observed that it is a part of a natural definition of potential with descendants in cyclic hodge algebras that appears as a special case of degeneration of vertex - like zwiebach invariants multiplied by tautological classes .    in this paper",
    ", we present and study this construction .",
    "we prove in a completely algebraic way that hodge field theory correlators satisfy the same equations as a gromov - witten potential : string , dilaton , and the whole system of pdes coming from tautological relations in the cohomology of the moduli space of curves ( see also  @xcite for some preliminary results ) .",
    "in what follows we will not only present the proof but also will do our best relating algebraic definitions and statements on hodge field theory to analoguous constructions and theorems in the theory of zwiebach invariants .",
    "in section  [ sec - gw ] we remind all necessary facts about the axiomatic gromov - witten theory . in section  [ sec - z ]",
    "we define zwiebach invariants and explain the motivation to consider the sums over graphs in cyclic hodge algebras .",
    "in section  [ sec - defpot ] we define cyclic hodge algebras and the corresponding descendant potential . in section  [ sec - proper ] we state the main properties of the descendant potential in cyclic hodge algebras , and the rest of the paper",

    "for the detailed description of the correspondence between tautological relations and universal pdes for gw potentials see , e.  g. , @xcite or  @xcite .    there are @xmath80 basic tautological relations known at the moment : wdvv , getzler , belorousski - pandharipande , and topological recursion relations in @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85  @xcite .",

    "the very general principles of homological algebra imply that algebraic stuctures on the cohomology are often induced by some fundamental structures on a full complex ( the standard example is the induction of the infinity - structures from differential graded algebraic structures ) .",
    "such induction usually can be represented as a sum over trees with vertices corresponding to fundamental operations and edges corresponding to the homotopy that contracts the complex to its cohomology .",
    "we would like to stress that gromov - witten invariants also can be considered as an induced structure on the cohomology of a complex . in this case , the fundamental structure on the whole complex is determined by zwiebach invariants .",
    "we are able to associate some structure on a bicomplex with a special compactification of the moduli space curves ( kimura - stasheff - voronov compactification ) .",

    "as we have explained in section  [ rel - for - corr ] , any linear relation @xmath76 among @xmath53-@xmath54-strata in the cohomology of the moduli space of curves gives rise to a family of universal relations for the correlators of a gromov - witten theory .",
    "[ thm - tautolog ] the system of universal relations coming from a tautological relation in the cohomology of the moduli space of curves holds for the correlators @xmath306 of cyclic hodge algebra .",

    "our argument below is a natural generalization of the technique introduced in these papers .",
    "also we are able now to give an explanation why we have managed to perform all our calculations there , see remark  [ last - remark ] .",
    "let us give here a brief account of the proof of this theorem .",
    "first , the definition of correlators of the hodge field theory can be extended to the intersection with an arbitrary tautological class @xmath307 of degree @xmath308 in the space @xmath9 , not only the a monomial in @xmath53-classes . in that case",
    ", we do the following .",
    "again , we consider the sum over all graphs @xmath236 with @xmath309 heavy edges , and the number @xmath237 is defined as above . instead of the coefficient @xmath247 we use the intersection number of @xmath307 with the stratum whose dual graph is obtained from @xmath236 by the procedure described right after the definition of @xmath249 .",
    "namely , a vertex with @xmath0 loops is replaced by a vertex marked by @xmath0 .",
    "this definition is very natural from the point of view of zwiebach invariants .",
    "however , we know from gromov - witten theory that this extension of the notion of correlator is unnecessary .",
    "indeed , all integrals with arbitrary tautological classes can be expressed in terms of the integrals with only @xmath53-classes via some universal formulas .",
    "the main question is whether these universal formulas also work in hodge field theory . actually , the main result that more or less immediately proves the theorem is the positive answer to this question .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of main theorem , and here we would like to overview it here .    in section 6 , we study the structure of graphs that can appear in formulas for the correlators of hodge field theory .",
    "we prove that if @xmath310 and there is at least one heavy edge in @xmath236 , then all vertices have genus @xmath311 , i.  e. , there is at most one empty loop at any vertex .",
    "this basically means that in calculations we ll have to deal only with genera @xmath47 and @xmath312 .",
    "also this allows us to write down the action of a hodge field theory .    in section 7 , we prove the main technical result ( main lemma ) .",
    "informally , it states that @xmath313 when we apply these two operators to the correlators of a hodge field theory .",
    "in order to prove it , we look at a small piece ( consisting just of one heavy edge and one or two vertices that are attached to it ) in one of the graphs of a correlator .",
    "of course , in the correlator we can vary this small piece in an arbitrary way , such that the rest of the graph remains the same .",
    "so , when we consider the sum of all these small pieces , it is also a correlator of the hodge field theory .",
    "thus we reduce the proof to a special case of the whole statement .",
    "but since the genus of a vertex is @xmath311 , it appear now to be a low - genera statement that can be done by a straightforward calculation .    in section 8",
    ", we present the proof of the main theorem .",
    "consider a @xmath53-@xmath54-stratum @xmath307 whose stable dual graph has @xmath59 edges .",
    "there is a universal expression of the integral over @xmath307 coming from gromov - witten theory .",
    "it includes @xmath122 entries of the scalar product restricted to @xmath4 . in terms of graphs , it means that we are to introduce new edges with the bivector @xmath206 $ ] on them , and there are @xmath122 such edges in our expression .",
    "a direct corollary of the main lemma is that we can always replace @xmath206 $ ] by @xmath207-\\psi [ g_-g_+]-[g_-g_+]\\psi$ ] .    in sections 8.2 , 8.3 , and 8.4 ,",
    "we show that when we replace @xmath206 $ ] by @xmath207-\\psi [ g_-g_+]-[g_-g_+]\\psi$ ] at all edges corresponding to the scalar product restricted to @xmath4 , we obtain a new expression for the integral over @xmath307 that again contains only heavy edges and empty loops , as any ordinary correlator .",
    "the main problem now is to understand the combinatorial coefficient of a graph @xmath236 obtained this way .",
    "since we have a sum over graphs with heavy edges and empty loops , it is natural to identify again these graphs with the corresponding strata in the moduli space of curves . then we can calculate the intersection index of the stratum corresponding to a graph @xmath236 and the initial class @xmath307 .",
    "roughly speaking , the main thing that we have to do is to decide about each node in @xmath307 ( represented initially by @xmath206 $ ] ) , whether we have this node in stratum corresponding to @xmath236 .",
    "if yes , then we have an excessive intersection ( so , we must put @xmath314 on one of the half - edges of the corresponding edge ) , and we keep this edge in @xmath236 ( so , we replace @xmath206 $ ] with @xmath315 $ ] or @xmath316\\psi$ ] ) . if no , then we do nt have this edge in @xmath236 , so we contract @xmath206 $ ] , i.  e. , replace it with @xmath207 $ ] .",
    "so , the procedure that we used to get rid of the scalar product is the same as the procedure of the intersection of @xmath307 with strata of the complementary dimension .",
    "this means ( section 8.5 ) that the universal formula coming from gromov - witten theory is equivalent to the natural formula for the `` correlator with @xmath307 '' coming from zwiebach theory .",
    "the tautological relation is a sum of classes equal to zero .",
    "so , while the universal formula coming from gromov - witten theory gives ( in the case of a vanishing class ) a non - trivial expression in correlators , the natural formula coming from zwiebach theory gives identically zero .",
    "this proves our theorem , see section 8.6 .",
    "in this section , we recall several useful lemmas shared in  @xcite . in particular , these lemmas give some strong restrictions on graphs that can give a non - zero contirbution to the correlators defined above .",
    "[ tillmann ]  @xcite the following vectors and bivectors are equal to zero : @xmath317    also let us remind another lemma in  @xcite that is very useful in calculations .",

    "consider a graph studied in section  [ subsec - correlators ] .",
    "it can have leaves , empty and heavy loops , and heavy edges . consider a vertex of such graph .",
    "let us assume that there are @xmath321 empty loops , @xmath322 heavy loops , @xmath323 heavy edges going to the other vertices of the graph , and @xmath324 leaves attached to this vertex : @xmath325 this picture can be considered as an @xmath326 form .",

    "if there are at least two empty loops at a vertex , then there should not be any heavy loops or edges attached to this vertex . otherwise the contribution of the whole graph vanishes .",
    "this implies    in the definition of correlators one should consider only graphs of one of the following two types :    1 .",
    "one - vertex graphs with no heavy edges ( loops ) .",
    "2 .   arbitrary graphs with at most one empty loop at each vertex .",
    "the contribution of all other graphs vanishes .",
    "this corollary dramatically simplifies all our calculations with graphs given below .",
    "also we can write down now the action of the hodge field theory .",

    "the numerous examples of the correspondence between stable dual graphs and graphs expressions in cyclic hodge algebras and also of the linear relations implied by the axioms of cyclic hodge algebra are given in  @xcite .",
    "below , we explain how one can represent the expression in correlators corresponding to a @xmath53-@xmath54-stratum in terms of graphs with only empty and heavy edges and with no white edges .",

    "but now the connecting edge is either marked by @xmath207 $ ] ( an empty edge ) or by @xmath161 $ ] ( an ordinary heavy edge ) .",
    "so , this way we get rid of the white edge in this case .    informally , in terms of pictures",
    ", we can describe equation   as @xmath391 when we put @xmath53 , we mean that we add one more @xmath53-class at the node at the corresponding branch of the curve .",
    "dashed circles denote correlators .",
    "we perform the same calculation as above , but now we explain it in terms of informal pictures from the very beginning .",
    "so , the first step is the same as above : @xmath392 then we apply lemma  [ main - lemma ] to each of the summands in the right hand side : @xmath393 @xmath394 and @xmath395 we take the sum of these three expressions , and we see that all pictures where we have edges with @xmath211 $ ] and @xmath210 $ ] are cancelled .",
    "so , we get an expression for the sum of graphs representing the initial stratum in terms of graphs with only empty and heavy edges .",
    "the general argument is exactly the same as in the second example .",
    "in fact , this gives a procedure how to write an expression in graphs with only empty and heavy edges ( and no white edges ) starting from a stable dual graph .",
    "let us describe this procedure .",
    "take a stable dual graph corresponding to a @xmath53-@xmath54-stratum of dimension @xmath122 in @xmath9 .",
    "first , we are to decorate it a little bit . for each edge , we either leave it untouched , or substitute it with an arrow ( in two possible ways ) . at the pointing end of the arrow , we increase the number of @xmath53-classes by @xmath312 .",
    "each of these graphs we weight with the inversed order of its automorphism group ( automorphisms must preserve all decorations ) multiplied by @xmath396 , where @xmath397 is the number of arrows .    consider a decorated dual graph .",
    "to each its vertex we associate the corresponding correlator of cyclic hodge algebra ( we add new leaves in order to represent @xmath54-classes ) .",
    "then we connect the leaves corresponding to the nodes either by empty edges ( if the corresponding edge of the decorated graph is untouched ) or by heavy edges ( if the corresponding edge of the dual graph is decorated by an arrow ) .",
    "we can simplify the resulting graphs obtained in the previous subsection .",
    "first , we can contract empty edges ( as much as it is possible ; it is forbidden to contract loops ) .",
    "second , we can remove leaves added for the needs of @xmath54-classes .",
    "indeed , each such leaf is equipped with a unit of @xmath110 , so it does nt affect the contraction of tensors corresponding to a graph . moreover , when we remove all leaves corresponding to @xmath54-classes , we still have graph with at least trivalent vertices . otherwise , this graph is equal to zero , c.  f. arguments in the proofs of string and dilaton equations .",
    "so , we obtain final graphs that have the same number of heavy edges as the dimension of the initial @xmath53-@xmath54-stratum , the same number of leaves as the initial dual graph , and some number of empty loops , at most one at each vertex . the exceptional case is when @xmath398 ; in this case we obtain only one graph , with one vertex , @xmath87 leaves , and @xmath0 empty loops .    in the first case ,",
    "let us turn a graph like this into a stable dual graph . just replace its vertices with no empty loops by vertices of genus zero , vertices with empty loops by vertices of genus one , heavy edges are edges , and leaves are leaves .",
    "there are no @xmath53- or @xmath54- classes .",
    "it is obvious that the codimension of the stratum corresponding to this dual graph is @xmath122 .",
    "indeed , in this case it is just the number of nodes .",
    "so , to each @xmath53-@xmath54-stratum @xmath399 of dimension @xmath400 we associate a linear combination @xmath401 of strata of codimension @xmath122 with no @xmath53- or @xmath54-classes , whose curves have irreducible components of genus @xmath47 and @xmath312 only .",
    "we prove it two steps .",
    "first , consider a one - vertex stable dual graph with no edges ( just a correlator ) . in this case , the intersection number @xmath403 is just by definition @xmath404 , where @xmath405 is the cyclic hodge algebra graph that turns into @xmath406 via the procedure described above .",
    "then , consider a stable dual graph with one edge .",
    "it is the intersection of the one - vertex stable dual graph with an irreducible component of the boundary . for a given @xmath406 , this component of the boundary either intersects it transversaly , or we have an excessive intersection . in the first case ,",
    "the corresponding node is not represented in @xmath406 .",
    "this means that in @xmath405 it should be an empty edge . in the second case ,",
    "this node is one of the nodes of @xmath406 , so it should be a heavy edge of @xmath405 .",
    "also , it is an excessive intersection , so we are to add the sum of @xmath53-classes with the negative sign at the marked points ( half - edges ) corresponding to the node , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) .",
    "if @xmath398 , this means that each of the vertices of the initial stable dual graph also has dimension @xmath47 , and the corresponding correlator of cyclic hodge algebra is represented by one one - vertex graph with no heavy edges . also this means that each edge of the initial stable dual graph is replaced in the algorithm above by an empty edge .",
    "so , we can think that we just work with the correlators of the gromov - witten theory of the point .",
    "in this case proposition becomes obvious .",
    "consider the system of subalgebras @xmath408 of the cohomological tautological algebras of @xmath9 generated by strata with no @xmath53- or @xmath54-classes and with irreducible curves of genus @xmath47 and @xmath312 only .",
    "let @xmath76 be a linear combination of @xmath53-@xmath54-strata of dimension @xmath122 in @xmath9 .",
    "then the expression in correlators of cyclic hodge algebras corresponding to @xmath76 is equaivalent to a sum of some graphs with coefficients equal to the intersection of @xmath76 with classes in @xmath409 .",
    "so , if the class of @xmath76 is equal to zero , then the corresponding equation ( and also the whole system of equations that we described in section  [ rel - for - corr ] ) for correlators of cyclic hodge algebra is valid .",
    "theorem is proved .",
    "evidently , @xmath410 is a module over @xmath411 .",
    "also it is obvious that @xmath410 is closed under pull - backs and push - forwards via the forgetful morphisms .",
    "this explains why it was enough to make only one check in the simplest case in order to get the system of equations in  @xcite ( cf .",
    "an argument in the last section in  @xcite ) .",
    "from the point of view of the theory of zwiebach invariants , both propositions look very natural .",
    "indeed , we try to give a graph expression for the integral of an induced gromov - witten form multiplied by a tautological class @xmath399 . since we know that we are able to integrate only degree zero parts of induced gromov - witten invariants",
    ", we should just take the sum over all graphs that correspond to the strata of complimentary dimension in @xmath410 .",
    "the coefficients are to be the intersection numbers of these strata with @xmath399 .",
    "on the other hand , we know that in any gromov - witten theory it is enough to fix the integrals of gromov - witten invariants multiplied by @xmath53-classes .",
    "then the integrals of gromov - witten invariants multiplied by arbitrary tautological classes are expressed by universal formulas .",
    "we can try to use these universal formulas also in hodge field theory .",
    "they are exactly our expressions with white edges .",
    "so , we have two different natural ways to express in terms of graphs the integrals of induced gromov - witten invariants multiplied by tautological classes . propositions  [ prop1 ] and  [ prop2 ] state that these two different expressions coinside .                                          a. losev , hodge strings and elements of k. saito s theory of primitive form , topological field theory , primitive forms and related topics ( kyoto , 1996 ) , 305335 , progr .",
