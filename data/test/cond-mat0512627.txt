    "when a commensurate one - dimensional charge density wave ( cdw ) is doped , the resulting charges may be viewed as defects in the cdw . if the interactions between them are sufficiently strong compared to their effective kinetic energy , then they will form an ordered lattice ( which can be stabilized by a crossover to 3d order if there are many @xmath2 chains coupled together ) of defects and the cdw will become incommensurate with the lattice .",
    "this can be more energetically favorable than simply doping holes into the rigid band formed in the presence of cdw order at a fixed wavevector .",
    "the reason is that , in the latter case , we must pay the single - particle energy gap of the cdw . in a two - dimensional @xmath0-density wave ( ddw )",
    "state , however , there are nodes in the order parameter , so it is relatively painless for doped holes to simply go to the nodes , which expand into fermi pockets ( in quasi-@xmath2 systems , however , this might not be possible , so doping must lead to incommensurability @xcite ) .",
    "however , this can not continue indefinitely if the ddw state is stabilized by approximate nesting , since the fermi surface ( fs ) would eventually move away from the nesting wavevector .",
    "thus , incommensurate ddw order is a strong possibility , at least over some range of hole dopings . in this paper",
    ", we explore this possibility .",
    "near half - filling , the hubbard model , the @xmath3 model , and generalizations of these appear to have many phases which are nearby in energy @xcite .",
    "thus , small perturbations can strongly influence the competition between them .",
    "consequently , it should not be too surprising that experiments on the cuprate superconductors have also uncovered evidence for a cornucopia of phases , particularly on the underdoped side of the phase diagram , which appear in particular materials and for certain values of the doping level , temperature , magnetic field , etc . @xcite .",
    "depending on the interfacial energies between these phases , one way in which their competition can be resolved is through the formation of stripes @xcite or other inhomogeneous patterns of microscale phase - separation .",
    "neutron scattering and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments point towards this possibility@xcite .",
    "furthermore , as the cuprates are doped , their fermi surfaces evolve away from the commensurate nesting wavevector @xmath4 , so we would expect translational symmetry - breaking order parameters to occur at incommensurate wavevectors .",
    "hence , it would seem important for any theory of the pseudogap to incorporate the tendency towards incommenuration , which we take as further impetus to study incommensurate ( ic ) order parameters related to ddw order .",
    "in this paper we consider various ways in which @xmath0-density wave ( ddw ) order can go incommensurate . before turning to this discussion",
    ", we review the reasons for expecting ddw order to occur in the pseudogap regime of the cuprates . it has been suggested@xcite that competition between ddw order and @xmath5-wave superconductivity ( dsc ) can explain many of the anomalous properties of the pseudogap@xcite .",
    "the ddw order parameter is given by @xmath6 with @xmath7 and a _ commensurate _ ( c ) ordering wavevector @xmath8 .",
    "the particle - hole condensate in breaks translation by one lattice spacing , parity , and time - reversal but is invariant under the combination of any two of the above symmetries . in real space",
    "it is represented by currents which alternate from one plaquette to the next .",
    "one motivation for considering ddw order is to explain @xcite the abrupt depletion of the superfluid density below the critical @xmath9 in bi2212 and similar dopings in other materials @xcite .",
    "because the order has a @xmath5-wave momentum dependence , its onset would explain arpes measurements above @xmath10 in the pseudogap @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since ddw is a spin - singlet condensate , it would also explain the suppression of the spin susceptibility in nmr measurements and opening of a spin gap in inelastic neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "also , the depletion of the c - axis conductivity @xcite , whose contribution mostly comes from the antinodal regions , would also be naturally explained by the development of ddw order , which gaps these regions .",
    "direct attempts to measure ddw order through neutron scattering have neither ruled it out @xcite nor unambiguously verified its presence , but there are intriguing suggestions that it may be present@xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask whether ddw order is compatible with incommensurability .",
    "( for a discussion of the experimental signatures of ddw order , the reader is referred to the literature @xcite .",

    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in section [ susc ]",
    "we develop some preliminary intuition about the energetics of ic density wave order by analyzing the ddw susceptibility of a fermi liquid ( both the nested and non - nested cases ) . in section",
    "[ c - ic ] we review some of the theory of commensurate ( c ) ddw order and show various ways to make it incommensurate .",
    "we also suggest the kind of microscopic physics that could lead to c and ic ddw , and in addition discuss possible experimental signatures of ic ddw .",
    "finally , in section [ num ] , we compute the mean - field phase diagrams of an extended hubbard model .",
    "our main results are that ( a ) ic ddw develops for a wide range of parameters , but ( b ) the ic wavevectors can be very small .",
    "their relevance to the cuprates may , at most , be for a rather narrow set of dopings .",
    "we also offer a physical explanation of our results , which sheds some light on the nature of c - ic ddw transition in extended hubbard models .",
    "we note that similar incommensurate order has been found in refs .",
    "the easiest way to see that ic ddw phases could arise in effective models ( which , in this paper , will , in turn , emerge from microscopic extended hubbard models with correlated hopping terms@xcite ; see section [ micro ] for details ) is to consider the bare susceptibility as a function of the incommensurability wavevector @xmath12 , where @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is defined after eq .",
    "[ cop ] . here , for simplicity",
    ", ddw is considered without the presence of any other order . in eq .",
    "[ suscep ] , @xmath16 is the fermi occupation number , and the energy dispersion contains nearest , @xmath17 , and next - nearest neighbor , @xmath18 , hopping parameters , @xmath19 .",
    "the ddw equivalent of the stoner criterion is satisfied when the right - hand - side of this equation approaches the inverse of the pertinent coupling @xmath20 .",
    "this observation allows us to interpret the positions of the peaks of @xmath21 as the wavevectors at which ddw order is likely to occur as we lower the temperature .",
    "a similar analysis was done by schulz@xcite for the case of af and ic sdw order in the hubbard model close to half - filling , where perfect nesting at half - filling was asumed .",

    "the support of @xmath27 in the integrand in is at @xmath28 and symmetry - related antinodal points of the fs since this is where the ddw order parameter is large .",
    "however , since these points are also the location of van hove singularities , the regions around them also dominate the af susceptibility .",
    "thus , at least in the @xmath26 case , one expects that whenever an ic sdw instability occurs , an ic instability for ddw should also occur .",
    "indeed , for both orders , the peak of @xmath21 occurs at @xmath29 for low enough temperatures and sufficiently away from half - filling , e.g. if @xmath30 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ suscfig ] .",
    "note that the same analysis repeated with any other density wave or spin - density wave order would yield an ic instability as long as the dominant channels of the modulation coincide with fermi surface points which give large contributions to the susceptibility . for instance , a @xmath31-density wave@xcite with wavevector @xmath32 has a peak in @xmath33 for @xmath34 away from half filling at @xmath35 , in the case @xmath26 .",
    "a natural question to ask is : to what extent does the ic ddw instability mimic the ic sdw one ? to answer this , one needs to consider specific models as we do in [ micro ] .",
    "however , two differences can be anticipated even beforehand .",
    "first , the ddw order parameter has nodes , while the af order parameter does not .",
    "second , in a more realistic model , one must consider competition with dsc , which also could change features of the transition to ic state .",
    "a better understanding of ic ddw order parameter is necessary to better understand the the situation away from half - filling .",
    "given that the susceptibility points towards an ic instability , the next issue is what ic ddw order would look like . before addressing this question ,",
    "let us first summarize some features of the c - case.@xcite in the c case , a general singlet particle - hole condensate can be written as ( neglecting the @xmath36 contribution ) : @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is the magnitude of the order parameter .",
    "the wavevector @xmath39 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the spin index @xmath40 included above will be omitted in the future for simplicity unless clarity requires otherwise .",
    "in , the form factor @xmath15 , which can transform non - trivially under the point group of the 2-d lattice , is related to the angular momentum of the particle - hole condensate . for ddw order , @xmath41 which corresponds to @xmath42 and @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "a @xmath31-density - wave with @xmath43 has @xmath44 , which corresponds to @xmath45 .    in real space , becomes @xmath46 where the vertices @xmath47 of the orders discussed above are given by @xmath48 note that the factors of @xmath49 in @xmath50 and @xmath51 signify that the corresponding phases break time - reversal , e.g. current flows along the bonds .",
    "positive / negative signs in represent current going in / out of the vertex .",
    "translation invariance , by default , is broken by any density wave order since there is a preferred vector @xmath52 , but in the c case , invariance under a _ subset _ of the lattice group is retained .",
    "ddw order , for example , is invariant under translation by linear combinations of even reciprocal lattice vectors along each bond direction .",
    "the current along the bonds is given by : @xmath53 here @xmath54 is along either the @xmath55- or @xmath56-direction . because of the equivalence of @xmath52 and @xmath57 in the c case , the current is simply @xmath58 .",
    "in the ddw case this results in an alternating plaquette current / checkerboard magnetic field patterns.@xcite      to obtain an ic version of ddw order , one first notes that ddw is chiral and hence breaks the ising symmetry which reverses all the clockwise plaquette currents into counter - clockwise and vice versa .",
    "therefore one can construct anti - phase domain walls as in fig.[fig : domains ] . a simple caricature of a bond - oriented domain wall is given in fig.[fig : domains]a .",
    "its real space representation is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the step function , so @xmath61 with @xmath62 . at the midpoint of the domain wall ,",
    "the currents in the @xmath63-direction vanish while the currents in the @xmath64-direction are halved .",
    "the diagonal domain wall depicted in figure [ fig : domains]b has a similar representation .",
    "note that because of the halving of the @xmath64-direction currents at the midpoint of the bond - domain wall in , we need to include the term : @xmath65 where the new vertices @xmath66 are given by : @xmath67 such vertices seem necessary for ic transitions of current density waves .",
    "one could imagine situations in which the transition to a disordered state is driven by thermal proliferation of such vertices , similar to earlier analysis of the 6-vertex model@xcite .",
    "although the analysis of such a transition is an interesting topic on its own , we will not pursue it in this paper .",
    "we are more interested in the energetics of the ic phase , so a long - wavelength mean - field treatment is sufficient .    to analyze the c - ic transition ,",
    "one then considers an array of alternating domain walls with average separation @xmath68 .",
    "then , in the single harmonic approximation one retains only the @xmath69 term in and identifies @xmath70 with the incommensurability wavevector .",
    "the new short - range vertex contributions are also neglected in the lowest harmonic approximation .",
    "the neglect of higher harmonics should not change the transition temperature@xcite or the value of the critical doping for the onset of ic order since @xmath38 is small and the corrections are of higher order in @xmath38 .",
    "an incommensurate instability in a clean system occurs when @xmath68 becomes finite .",
    "( in a disordered system , it occurs when when @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a characteristic length scale for the disorder . )    within the single harmonic approximation , an array of anti - phase domain walls with separation @xmath73 , looks simpler in momentum space : @xmath74 note that in the limit @xmath75 , the above reduces to .",
    "one could have guessed the result by writing @xmath76 in the commensurate case , and then let @xmath52 go incommensurate .",
    "this suggests other ways to get ic order .",
    "in particular the oddness of ddw order with respect to rotations by @xmath77 and transpositions about , say , the @xmath4 direction lead to the following example of a ddw _ checkerboard pattern _ : @xmath78 where the operation @xmath79 can be either a transposition , or a rotaion by @xmath77 . the checkerboard pattern in corresponds to simply superimposing two domain walls rotated by @xmath77 with respect to each other .    in a similar spirit",
    ", one could also investigate the possibility of _ non - topological _",
    "domain walls@xcite , e.g. ic domains as the above , superimposed with an uniform order , so the overall order parameter does not change chirality . however , as we will see in sec .",
    "[ num ] , much of the physics of the c - ic transition will already be transparent from the simpler choices and of order parameter .",
    "finally , note that within the single harmonic approximation , and are current - conserving only to lowest order in @xmath22 .",
    "for the purpose of clarifying the energetics of the ic order close to the c - ic transition , or in the cases where the magnitude of the incommensurability is small , this lowest order approximation is good enough .",
    "our numerical results , sec .",
    "[ num ] , _ a posteriori _ show that we are in such regime",
    ".      we will consider the above order parameters in the context of the following hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath80 in this formula , @xmath81 is hopping with @xmath82 for nearest neighbors , @xmath83 for next nearest neighbors and @xmath84 otherwise .",
    "@xmath85 is a correlated hopping term which simultaneously hops an electron from site @xmath86 to site @xmath49 and hops an electron from @xmath87 into the vacated site @xmath86 .",

    "a similar reduced hamiltonian for @xmath5-wave superconductivity has @xmath94 .",
    "note that the processes responsible for both dsc and ddw are essentially kinetic .",
    "a hamiltonian of the form ( [ micro - ham ] ) has one important virtue : it has a @xmath5-wave superconducting ground state over a range of dopings ( and an antiferromagnetic ground state at half - filling ) .",
    "since this is the _ sine qua non _ for any description of the cuprates , we believe that this is a good starting point . one may object that correlated hopping terms have to be put in by hand in a microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "however , they naturally arise even from the one - band hubbard model away from half - filling , where their contribution can be computed in @xmath95 perturbation theory : @xmath96 at dopings @xmath97 , for @xmath98 , we would have @xmath99 . thus ,",
    "not far away from half - filling , correlated hopping terms are certainly not negligible .",
    "let us generalize the mean field description of c ddw to the ic case .",

    "[ icop ] , where we wrote down the _ commensurate _ order parameter without making use of the @xmath100 symmetry , and as a result the generalization to incommensurate @xmath52 was straightforward .",

    "the only subtlety , as we discuss at the end of this section , is that although @xmath104 reduces to the mean - field free energy in the c phase , in the ic phase it is _ not _ the free energy even within the single harmonic approximation . instead , minimization of @xmath104 is equivalent to a variational search of the ground state .",

    "@xmath22 is independent of the onset of dsc , fig .",
    "[ fig : qoft ] , but because incommensurability relieves the ddw - dsc competition , the onset of dsc correlates to the presence of ic ddw .",
    "let us first discuss ( a ) .",
    "it is well known@xcite that in the weak - coupling hubbard model at @xmath26 , the af instability at half - filling is driven ic for any non - zero doping ( see sec .",
    "[ suscep ] ) .",
    "the source of the c - ic transition can be traced to the approximate nesting of the bare fermi surface ( fs ) at ic wavevectors away from half - filling .",

    "[ fig : afpd1 ] .",
    "the incommensurability ( deviation from @xmath4 ) is horizontal or vertical , not diagonal , as we would expect because the bare susceptibility is more divergent due to a greater overlap between nested portions of the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "a similar scenario happens in the case of ddw order .",
    "however , two notable differences from the af case are present .",
    "first , ddw is less sensitive to @xmath167 , since it is driven mainly by antinodal regions of high density of states ( d.o.s . ) .",
    "therefore , while there is no af instability without nesting ( at half - filling af fermi surface instability is only possible if @xmath168 ) , ddw is still possible in this regime .",
    "this suggests that whenever the antinodal regions of the bare fs evolve away from the anti - nodal regons ( which happen to also be regions with a high density of states as a result of the presence of van hove singularities ) , a c - ic transition is likely to occur .    .",
    "the results of schulz@xcite were recovered . here , we used @xmath169ev with @xmath134ev .",

    ", we find that the doping values @xmath173 for which the above type of c - ic ddw is possible are unrealistically high in the context of the cuprates , if one considers more realistic bare fs , @xmath174 .",
    "furthermore , in the ic ddw case , there need not be a simple relation @xmath166 between the doping and doping and deviation from commensurability .",
    "let us now discuss the c - ic transitions that are present in our phase diagrams proximate to ` magic ' filling fractions @xmath175 .",
    "although our understanding as to why they arise is incomplete , we would like to point out several interesting features about our results .",
    "first , to our knowledge , there is nothing special about the bare fs close to these filling fractions , likewise for the fs of the commensurate ordered state .",
    "the c - ic transition is not driven by nesting , since upon variation of @xmath18 we see similar signatures proximate to the ` magic ' dopings .",
    "second , the magnitude of the ic wavevector is generally small ( corresponding to periodicity of more than @xmath176 lattice spacings ) and shows no clear dependance on @xmath177 , figs .",
    "[ fig : qdw4 - 2tp006 ] -[fig : qdw2 - 1tp012 ] .",
    "third , we checked that similar behavior is present deep into the af ordered state in the total free energy .",
    "[ fig : qaf004t0tp004 ] . unlike the ddw case , however , the ic lattice spacing in the af case depends on @xmath177 : @xmath22 follows an increasing staircase pattern at ` magic ' dopings .",
    "note that our results for af order seem to contradict schulz s results@xcite which predict a linear dependence of @xmath149 .",
    "the naive contradiction is easily resolved by realizing that schulz s computation@xcite of @xmath149 relies on the stoner criterion , which is strictly valid at @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , while deep into the ordered state the ic wavevector is stepwise increasing at ` magic ' fractions , at higher temperatures we regain the linearity of @xmath178 , fig .",
    "[ fig : qaf004t035tp004 ] .",
    "moreover , the fact that both the bare and the gapped fs in the c case are generally not nested at the the ` magic ' fractions suggests that the transition is not driven by a divergent susceptibility , but is first order .",
    "indeed , at low temperatures , the chemical potential near the special dopings is non - monotonic for both the af and the ddw+dsc diagrams .",
    "similar behavior of @xmath151 was found by nayak and pivovarov in the context of c ddw competing with dsc@xcite .",
    "a simple view of the energetics is given by the following landau - ginsburg free energy of two nodeless competing orders ( the generalization to order parameters with nodes is straightforward ) : @xmath179 in this free energy , @xmath180 plays the role of the ddw order parameter and @xmath181 the role of superconductivity . when @xmath182 becomes negative , @xmath180 orders at non - zero wavevector @xmath183 .",
    "this occurs at the dopings indicated in figures [ fig : ddwpd3 ] and [ fig : ddwpd4 ] .",
    "when @xmath181 orders , this further favors incommensurability if @xmath184 since the competition between the two orders is partially alleviated .",
    "this alleviation is a possible explanation of why the onset of dsc at low @xmath152 is correlated to the presence of ic - ddw .     and @xmath151 ( inset ) at @xmath136 for @xmath185ev , @xmath186ev .",
    "note that @xmath187ev which is smaller than the value taken in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddwpd2].,height=288 ]     except this time @xmath143ev as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddwpd2].,height=288 ]     and @xmath149 ( inset ) at @xmath150ev corresponding to the parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddwpd3 ] .",
    "although here the ic response is not at ` magic ' fractions , note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddwpd3 ] there is dsc both at @xmath164 and @xmath165 . ,",
    "height=288 ]     ( and at the same temperature ) except this time there is a clear c - ic transition at ` magic ' fractions ( inset ) . at the same time",
    "@xmath151 is non - monotonic at these dopings .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath188ev and @xmath189ev are the same as in fig . [",
    "fig : ddwpd4].,height=288 ]     ev ) staircase ic spectrum of af around ` magic ' filling fractions .",
    "the parameters we have taken here are @xmath190 ev , @xmath142 ev .",
    "inset : @xmath151 is non - monotonic at both jumps of @xmath149 , but is smoothly decreasing whenever @xmath22 is pinned.,height=288 ]    the same phenomenon can be viewed from the opposite perspective : when ddw order becomes incommensurate , there are regions in which it is suppressed ( as in the domain walls of fig .",
    "2 ) . superconductivity can occur more easily there .",
    "hence , incommensurability alleviates the competition between dsc and ddw order at the mean - field level , thereby enhancing superconductivity .",
    "of course , ic order appears to suppress superconductivity in the cuprates , but this could be due to effects beyond a simple mean - field theory .    when the superconducting order parameter becomes strong enough , it may become energetically favorable for phase separation to occur .",
    "we can guess when this occurs from the usual maxwell construction whenever the mean field chemical potential @xmath151 does not vary monotonically .",
    "this appears to occur at a few isolated ` magic ' doping values . however , in a real system , proximity to a second order critical point@xcite , coulomb repulsion@xcite , or disorder could drive the system in a state of mesoscopic phase separation .",
    "moreover , the lattice pins any ic density wave order , so once the system is ic in order to minimize the free energy , the deviation from commensurability @xmath22 would be pinned at a finite value . finally , it is important to remember that disorder could have important effects .",
    "it would not only disorder the array of domain walls , but could lead to droplets of one phase in regions of another",
    ".     regains its linearity around @xmath191 as predicted by schulz@xcite . here",
    "@xmath192ev and all other parameters are as in fig .",
    "[ fig : qaf004t0tp004 ] .",
    "inset : @xmath151 is monotonic throughout , suggesting that at higher temperatures , the c - ic transition is driven purely by ic nesting of the fs away from half - filling.,height=288 ]    we stress that while the general trend towards ic order may be clear , many of the quantitative aspects are not clear , in particular the precise copings at which ddw order becomes incommensurate .",
    "it is not clear to us why such c - ic transitions happen near ` magic ' filling fractions .",
    "the fact that similar behavior occurs in the case of af order suggests that the tendency of phase separation at ` magic ' filling fractions is a general trend for a variety of density wave order . because the af only case was explored upon taking the @xmath193 limit in the full free energy , it is not clear yet whether the tendency of phase separation at ` magic ' filling fractions is purely a feature of density waves competing with other order parameters , or of the lattice",
    ". it might be worth reconsidering the af case in the presence of other order parameters ( such as ddw , dsc ) .",
    "what makes our results surprising is that unlike in the frustrated phase separation picture for stripe formation , there is no coulomb repulsion present .",
    "hence , there is no obvious connection between phase separation and incommensurability .",
    "( please note that while ic ddw order can induce charge density wave order at twice the wavevector , we have not included this effect , which we expect to be small , in our calculation . ) therefore , while coulomb repulsion may play a role in determining the cdw spacing at @xmath164 in @xmath194 , in our calculation , the phase separation at ` magic ' fractions can only arise as interplay between the lattice , competing order physics and energetics .",
    "what exactly is the combination of the three deserves some future research as the analog of the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state of dsc in a magnetic field parallel to the plane@xcite . in the absence of next - nearest neighbor hopping",
    ", the two mean fields are related via a particle - hole transformation in the same way _ commensurate _ ddw is related to dsc at half - filling . however , while in the latter case one can rotate c ddw to dsc@xcite , in the case of finite @xmath155 , the particle - hole transformation can not interchange fflo and ic ddw .",
    "while the mean - field hamiltonians of ic ddw and the fflo are related by a particle - hole transformation , the spectra are not  in the ic ddw state there is a splitting to a generally uncountably many bands ( if @xmath195 is irrational as we discussed in sec .",
    "[ num ] ) since the order parameter connects @xmath108 and @xmath196 while in the case of dsc there is no such splitting .",
    "we are indebted to the authors of @xcite for pointing out their work to us . ] .",
    "according to the discussion following it seems likely that within the dsc state a competing ddw order parameter is ic as it develops .",
    "hence , we briefly describe the experimental signatures that would distinguish between c and ic ddw order .",
    "originally , c ddw was also named ` hidden order ' in the context of the pseudogap , because most of the experimental signatures associated with it are indirect .",
    "the magnetic field , created by the alternating currents around neighboring plaquettes , is too small to be detected by neutron scattering ( @xmath197 g for @xmath198 mev ) . at the same time , because of the symmetry of the c ddw magnetic field , there is no signature in nmr .",
    "the charge of the c ddw state is uniform so stm would not show signatures , unless they are associated with interference of nodal quasiparticles due to scattering off impurities . it has been argued recently@xcite that such interference disperses weakly enough to account for the pseudogap d.o.s .",
    "incommensurate modulations observed by stm . for a further discussion of the signatures of c ddw , the reader is referred to the literature @xcite .",
    "an ic ddw is more easily detectable directly .",
    "the local electronic density of states would be modulated due to the ic order parameter , and hence could be observable by stm .",
    "secondly , the ic modulations of the staggered currents would produce nmr line splitting of both the cu and o atoms when the applied magnetic fields are _ perpendicular _ to the a - b planes .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with ic sdw , where there is an nmr line - splitting due to spatially modulated local magnetization , which is directed _ along _ the a - b plane .",
    "let us estimate the modulated magnetic field strength arising from ic ddw ( the reader is referred to@xcite where similar considerations are applied to the case of orbital antiferromagnetism proposed to exist in @xmath199 ) .",
    "suppose we have an array of domain walls , fig .",
    "[ fig : domains ] , along the y - axis .",
    "deep between the domains the field is zero as in the case of c ddw . along a domain at @xmath200 , where the field is maximal , again most of the fields cancel except those created by the vertical alternating currents of strength @xmath201 at @xmath202 and those of strength @xmath203 at @xmath204 .",
    "equivalently this would be the field of a single vertical array of alternating currents of strength @xmath203 at @xmath202 : @xmath205 where @xmath206/[\\sqrt{((i-1)a + y_0)^2 + x^2_0}]$ ] and @xmath207 for o , cu atoms respectively . clearly at @xmath208 , cu ,",
    "atoms the field is zero by symmetry . for o atoms",
    "the sum can be performed yielding @xmath209 . in the dilute domain limit , this field is independent of the distance between the domains .    for a sinusoidal current modulation , @xmath210 would depend on the modulation length @xmath211 . if @xmath212 then a good estimate of @xmath210 is given by with @xmath201 replaced by @xmath213 where @xmath177 is the periodicity of the modulation ( in units of the lattice spacing ) .",
    "therefore , for large @xmath177 we obtain @xmath214 .",
    "incommensurate order is an important possibility when competing orders are considered . at a first - order transition",
    "the system is phase separated and hence necessarily inhomogeneous .",
    "if the competition between the orders is weak , coexistence is possible , but modulations of the competing orders are likely to be induced .",
    "the effects of the lattice , disorder , lomg - range coulomb repulsion@xcite and proximity to criticality@xcite is to generally stabilize incommensurability on mesoscopic length scales .",
    "this is unlike the case of , say , the liquid to vapor phase transition where the competition results in phase separation on macroscopic length scales .    in the case of ddw and dsc ,",
    "the competition is certainly weak within the framework of the extended hubbard models we have considered . because the processes stabilizing both orders are of similar nature and are at the same time smaller than all of onsite repulsion , exchange and hopping , it does not cost much energy to convert ddw order into dsc and vice versa .",
    "a simple resolution of the competition is for ddw order to become incommensurate .",
    "we find that this occurs for some doping levels , but the incommensuration tends to be relatively small .",
    "such ic ddw could , in principle , be observable at low temperatures by nmr since it creates an inhomogeneous magnetic field at o atoms _ perpendicular _ to the ab - plane .",
    "most of nmr experiments test for much stronger magnetic fields _ parallel _ to the ab - plane on the cu atoms , and at higher temperatures such ic ddw phase would be smeared by thermal fluctuations , which may exlpain why such ic order , if it exists , it hasnt been seen by experiment .",
