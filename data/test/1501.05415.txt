    "detecting planetary transits is highly valuable not only because it makes an independent confirmation of a planet from radial - velocity observations but also because the photometric transits provide unambiguous information on planet masses and radii , and thus mean density and interior structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these properties of transiting planets provide valuable hints for planet formation and evolution processes including dynamical interaction between planets .",

    "it is impossible to detect such a transit from ground - based photometry and thus no transiting planets had been found around giant stars .",

    "the variations in the observed radial velocities for both targets show a sign of planetary companions to kepler-91 and koi-1894 . in order to obtain accurate and precise estimates for system parameters of those systems ,",
    "we here present a global analysis that makes use of all the available information from the _ kepler _ photometry and our spectroscopy .",
    "as is well known , a very precise light curve of a star orbited by planet(s ) shows a periodic modulation due to several astrophysical effects : the ellipsoidal variation , doppler boosting , and reflected / emission light from the planet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the last two effects ( doppler boosting and planetary reflection / emission ) are synchronous with the planet s orbital period @xmath47 , with different peak locations along the planet phase ( @xmath48 for boosting and @xmath49 for the planetary reflection / emission , respectively ) . on the other hand , the ellipsoidal variation , which is caused by a tidal distortion by the planet s gravity , have two flux peaks ( @xmath48 and 0.75 ) within one orbit .",
    "thanks to the different phase dependence of these three effects , a very precise light curve and its modeling enable us to distinguish these three effects , and we can extract physical parameters such as the planet - to - star mass ratio @xmath50 and scaled semi - major axis @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is semi - major axis and @xmath20 is stellar radius . moreover , for transiting systems as in the present cases , incorporating the transit and/or secondary eclipse model into the above phase - curve variation lets us learn more about the planet properties ( e.g. , planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath53 and orbital inclination @xmath54 ) .    to obtain the phase - folded light curves for kepler-91 and koi-1894 , and estimate system parameters , we downloaded all available public light curves ( q0q17 ) from _ kepler _ mast archive .",
    "while only long - cadence data were available for kepler-91 , koi-1894 s light curves involve some short - cadence data . adopting the pdc - sap flux data , for which unphysical artifacts are detrended , we reduced the light curves by the following procedure .",
    "first , after removing planetary transits , we further detrended and normalized the light curve for each quarter by fitting it with a fifth - order polynomial so as to remove the long - term trends that were not removed in the pdc - sap flux .",
    "this process was repeated implementing a @xmath55 clipping to remove outliers .",
    "we then combined the light curves for all quarters and phase - folded them with the ephemerides derived by the official _",
    "kepler _ team using the q1q16 data ; orbital period @xmath56 d and transit center @xmath57 bjd for kepler-91 , and @xmath58 d and @xmath59 bjd for koi-1894 ( from nasa exoplanet archive ) .",
    "we later consider the impact of incorrect ephemeris .",
    "finally , the folded light curves were binned into 300 and 250 phase bins for kepler-91 and koi-1894 , respectively .",
    "these bin numbers were adopted so that each bin approximately covers a cycle span of long - cadence data ( @xmath60 minutes ) . the flux error for each bin @xmath61 , which is the standard deviation of the mean flux ,",
    "was computed based on the dispersion of the flux values within the bin .",
    "the long - cadence and short - cadence flux data were separately folded and binned for koi-1894 , but the binned light curve of the short - cadence data was much noisier than that for long - cadence .",
    "we thus decided to ignore the short - cadence data in the following analysis .",
    "the analysis below is based on the method by @xcite , who employed the evil - mc model @xcite for the phase - curve variation ( i.e. , ellipsoidal variations , doppler boosting , and planetary reflection ) with some revisions ( e.g. , application to an eccentric orbit ) .",
    "this phase - curve model is multiplied by the analytic transit model by @xcite , and the relevant parameters ( e.g. , @xmath51 and @xmath54 ) are simultaneously determined .",
    "in addition , we also model and fit the observed radial velocities @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the @xmath63 statistics in the present case is @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the @xmath67-th observed radial velocity and its error , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the @xmath67-th observed light curve flux and its error , which are the mean flux and its standard deviation in the @xmath67-th bin , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the radial velocity is modeled as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 are the radial velocity semi - amplitude , true anomaly , orbital eccentricity , argument of periastron , and radial velocity offset of our dataset , respectively . for the light curve model @xmath76",
    ", we refer the readers to @xcite , for details . in the next subsections ,",
    "we describe the fitting procedure for each of the targets .",
    "the binned light curve of kepler-91 in figure [ fig : phase_koi2133 ] shows a clear pattern of phase - curve variation ; the double peaks at @xmath48 and 0.75 are representative of the ellipsoidal variation .",
    "in addition , figure [ fig : phase_koi2133 ] suggests a possible detection of secondary eclipse at @xmath77 , which means the reflected / emitted light from the planet is visible in the folded light curve .",
    "therefore , following @xcite and @xcite , we model the planet s light @xmath78 by the following expression : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the flux variation amplitude of planet s reflected / emitted light and @xmath81 is the planetary flux offset arising from the homogeneous surface emission .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we here introduce the  phase - delay \" @xmath82 of the brightest part on the planet surface from the substellar point .",
    "the planetary light @xmath78 is added to the flux model for the beaming and ellipsoidal variation , integrated over the stellar visible hemisphere and wavelength through the _ kepler _ band . in integrating the local flux calculated from the evil - mc model",
    ", we assume that the stellar effective temperature is 4550 k , and adopt the gravity darkening exponent of @xmath83 for equation ( 10 ) of @xcite based on the theoretical calculation by @xcite .",
    "the free parameters relevant to the light curve model are @xmath51 , the transit impact parameter @xmath84 , limb - darkening coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the quadratic limb - darkening law , @xmath50 ( @xmath87 ) , @xmath81 , @xmath80 , @xmath82 , the overall normalization factor @xmath88 for the folded light curve , @xmath53 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , which represents the small time deviation of the transit center from the ephemeris reported by the _",

    "in addition to the above mentioned twelve parameters , we add @xmath75 in equation ( [ eq : rvmodel ] ) to the fitting parameters . note that the radial velocity semi - amplitude @xmath71 in equation ( [ eq : rvmodel ] ) is related to the planet - to - star mass ratio @xmath50 by @xmath95 in computing the posteriors , we do not impose priors on the fitting parameters except for @xmath96 and @xmath97 ; due to the sparse sampling of the long - cadence data ( @xmath60 minutes ) and quality of the binned light curve , the limb - darkening coefficients are poorly constrained in the absence of priors , and thus we decide to put gaussian priors on the limb - darkening coefficients based on the theoretical table by @xcite as @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in our mcmc algorithm , originally developed in @xcite , the step size of each fitting parameter is iteratively scaled so that the overall acceptance ratio falls between 15% and 35% . after running 1,000,000 chains , the best - fit value and uncertainty for each fitting parameter are estimated from the median , and 15.87 and 84.13 percentiles of the marginalized posterior distribution of that parameter .",
    "shortly after we performed the first mcmc trial , we noticed a possible trend or drift in the observed radial velocities .",
    "figure [ fig : rv_koi2133_notrend ] plots the best - fit radial velocity curve as a function of the orbital phase @xmath100 . for clarity ,",
    "the data taken in 2013 are shown in green and those by the 2014 campaign are plotted in red . while we have detected a clear modulation with an amplitude of @xmath101 m s@xmath2 , radial velocities take lower values for the 2014 data , which is evident in the bottom panel indicating the residual of the observed radial velocities from the best - fit model .    in order to confirm the presence of the radial velocity drift , we try to fit the data with an additional parameter : the radial velocity drift @xmath102 . adding the drift term @xmath103 to the right side of equation ( [ eq : rvmodel ] ) , we performed again the mcmc simulation to fit both radial velocity and light curve .",
    "the derived best - fit parameters and their uncertainties are summarized in table [ tbl : best - fit - kepler91 ] .",
    "to compare between the radial velocity models with and without a drift term , we compute bayesian information criteria ( bic ) for the two cases , which is computed as @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the number of free parameters and @xmath106 is the number of data points . in the absence of a trend , we obtain @xmath107 , and for the case of the radial velocity model with @xmath102 , bic becomes 383 ; @xmath108 is much larger than 10 , meaning that the model with @xmath102 is strongly favored .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a radial velocity drift ( or trend ) is present in our dataset , and report the best - fit parameters for the case with @xmath102 as the final result .",

    "fixing the system parameters as @xmath156 k , @xmath157 , the gravity darkening exponent of @xmath158 @xcite , and @xmath159 derived with the q1q16 data ( see section [ method ] ) , we perform mcmc simulations for koi-1894 to infer the posterior distributions for the fitting parameters . in the present case , we have the eleven free parameters : @xmath51 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath50 , @xmath88 , @xmath53 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath75 .",
    "again , we assume gaussian priors for the limb - darkening parameters as @xmath160 , and @xmath161 from the table by @xcite . due to the weak radial - velocity signal of koi-1894.01 , we found that the global fit to the radial velocities and light curve exhibits a degeneracy between the fitting parameters ( e.g. , @xmath162 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "thus , for koi-1894 , we also impose an additional prior on the host star s density from table [ tbl : stars ] ( @xmath163 ) , assuming a gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the fitting algorithm is exactly the same as for kepler-91 .",
    "the result of the fit is summarized in table [ tbl : best - fit - koi1894 ] .",
    "the best - fit value for the mass ratio is @xmath164 , implying @xmath165 detection of the planet .",
    "the mass and radius ratios are translated as @xmath166 and @xmath167 assuming the stellar mass and radius in table [ tbl : stars ] .",
    "table [ tbl : best - fit - koi1894 ] also shows the result of our fit in the absence of the gaussian prior on @xmath168 .",
    "as expected , the mass constraint is slightly weaker for this case .",
    "the orbital eccentricity is poorly constrained due to the small planetary signal and small number of radial velocity data , but we can rule out a high eccentricity ( @xmath169 ) with our current datasets .",
    "we also try to fit the data with a circular orbit ( @xmath170 ) , and compare between the eccentric and circular cases .",
    "as shown in table [ tbl : best - fit - koi1894 ] , the circular orbital fit yields a slightly better constraint on the mass ratio ; @xmath171 with the stellar - density prior , leading to a @xmath172 detection .",
    "the mass and radius ratios are translated as @xmath173 and @xmath174 assuming the stellar mass and radius .",
    "based on the @xmath63 values for the best - fit parameters , we compare bic values for the two cases ; bic values of @xmath175 and @xmath176 are obtained for the eccentric and circular cases ( with the stellar - density prior ) , respectively , so that fitting with a circular orbit is favored .",
    "the observed radial velocities and whole light curve are plotted in figures [ fig : rv_koi1894 ] and [ fig : phase_koi1894 ] , with their best - fit models for @xmath170 .",
    "we also show zoomed - in versions of the transit and phase - curve variation in figures [ fig : transit_koi1894 ] and [ fig : ev_koi1894 ] , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : ev_koi1894 ] , the binned flux data used for the fit ( 250 bins ) are plotted by the red crosses , and black points with errorbars indicate the flux data binned into 30 bins .",
    "we also tested several periods around @xmath47 and found that about @xmath177 gave the minimum @xmath63 value in the global fitting ( @xmath178 ) , suggesting that the true period might exist around it .",
    "nonetheless , the resultant parameters are well consistent with those for the case of @xmath47 within 0.2@xmath4 level .",
    "differs by @xmath179 level . ]",
    "our global analysis indicates the detection of koi-1894.01 is still marginal , with only @xmath180 level , and the planet mass seems to be mainly constrained by the radial velocity data . in order to see if an independent estimate for the planet mass from the light curve alone gives a comparable result , we fit the folded light curve and estimate system parameters without radial velocity data . as a result",
    ", we obtain @xmath181 , consistent with the above result by the global fit .",
    "we reported the results of high - precision radial - velocity measurements with subaru / hds for the two _ kepler _ evolved stars kepler-91 and koi-1894 , which are candidates to host transiting planets .",
    "based on the simultaneous modeling of the radial - velocity data and _ kepler _ light curves , we independently confirmed the planetary nature of kepler-91b .",
    "the radial velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath182 m s@xmath2 we derived is consistent with what @xcite found ( @xmath183 m s@xmath2 ) with @xmath184 , but incompatible with the result by @xcite who reported @xmath185 m s@xmath2 with @xmath186 , although the reason for this discrepancy is unknown .",
    "we newly detected a drift of @xmath187 m s@xmath2 between the radial velocities taken at @xmath1 1-yr interval thanks to our better measurement precision and longer period of time of observations compared to the previous ones .",
    "the persistent radial velocity drift is suggestive of a possible presence of another companion ( planet ) outside of kepler-91b . due to the lack of data , however , we are not able to pin down the period nor mass of the companion .",
    "intensive high - precision radial - velocity monitoring of the star will uncover the unseen companion and provide hints for formation and evolution of the planetary system .",
    "the estimated parameters for kepler-91b in table [ tbl : best - fit - kepler91 ] are reasonably in good agreement with the previous study by @xcite except for the mass ratio @xmath50 and scaled semi - major axis @xmath51 . this is likely because our radial velocity data show a smaller amplitude and planet mass is estimated to be small . since the flux amplitude due to ellipsoidal variation is approximately proportional to @xmath188 @xcite , a small @xmath50 resulted in the smaller @xmath51 in order to explain the observed flux amplitude .",
    "the westward phase - shift ( @xmath189 ) of the flux maximum in planetary light ( from the substellar point ) is indicative of the inhomogeneous cloud coverage on the planetary surface .",
    "this is consistent with the trend that @xcite found , claiming that westward phase - shifts are preferentially seen for relatively cool close - in planets with equilibrium temperatures of @xmath190 k ; @xcite estimated the equilibrium temperature of kepler-91b to be @xmath191 k , depending on the assumed heat redistribution parameter .",
    "the magnitude of the phase - shift ( @xmath192 ) is , however , unusually large in our best - fit model compared with the previously reported values for other close - in planets @xcite .",
    "the reason is unknown , but the huge coverage of the planet surface illuminated by the host star of the planet surface is always illuminated by the host star due to its huge radius .",
    "] might be responsible .",
    "note that we also detected a dip in the folded light curve ( figure [ fig : phase_koi2133 ] ) around @xmath193 reported in @xcite , and this dip should have more or less affected the fitting result .",
