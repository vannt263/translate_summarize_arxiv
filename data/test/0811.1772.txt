    "magnetic reconnection takes place while topologically distinct regions approach each other and the magnetic field lines change their connectivity @xcite .",
    "the standard setup involves the violation of the ideal mhd approximation on the boundary between neighbouring magnetic domains where the field direction changes rapidly .",
    "the essential question is thus about the formation of antiparallel field lines and neutral points of the magnetic field . our objective is to explore if the reconnection process can be influenced by the strong gravitational field near a black hole ( bh ) , and whether the black - hole proximity creates conditions favourable to incite reconnection . to this end",
    "we examine the structure of the magnetic field lines twisted by a highly curved spacetime of a rotating bh .",
    "astrophysical black holes do not support their own intrinsic magnetic field .",
    "instead , the field is generated by currents in the surrounding plasma and brought down to the horizon by accretion .",
    "most likely , the magnetic field is frozen in an equatorial accretion disc which acts as a boundary condition .",
    "the inward - directed bulk transport of plasma is often in some kind of interaction with outflows and jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so the models of electromagnetic acceleration and collimation have been continuously advanced during the last decade @xcite .",
    "the presence of the central bh is essential .",
    "observations indicate that the initial acceleration happens very near the horizon @xcite , however , the exact mechanism and the place of the particle acceleration are still a subject of investigations .",
    "simulations as well as theoretical considerations point to the decisive importance of the magneto - rotational instability operating in the inner regions of the accreting bh systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the origin of highly collimated outflows is easier to understand with the help of an organised magnetic field .",
    "indeed , it has been argued that an organised magnetic field is needed to ensure the outflow collimation that is seen on larger scales , i.e.  @xmath0 in some accreting bh systems @xcite . at the same time",
    "the organised field has consequences for the turbulent dynamo mechanism @xcite .",
    "the role of an ordered component of the magnetic field and whether it may pervade down to the plunging region is a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "a distinctive feature here is the general - relativistic ( gr ) frame - dragging by the bh rotation which , however , can be concealed by mhd effects in astrophysically realistic situations @xcite .",
    "turbulent magnetic fields are thought to be limited to sub - equipartition values , so the rotating disc can indeed enter into the ergosphere .",
    "plasma acceleration is then driven not only by the frame - dragging effect of the black hole but mainly by the differential rotation . here",
    "we address a related issue , of the bh rotation , from another perspective : we assume a magnetically dominated system . distinguishing the impact of the two mechanisms is quite a delicate task when both are in operation .",
    "we assume that the magnetic pressure dominates the studied region of the ergosphere and has its origin in currents flowing farther out @xcite .",
    "even though the assumption of an ordered field component constrains the applicability of our calculation , the model setup can still be reconciled with the recent simulations in which the magnetic field pressure outside the main flow exceeds the gas pressure @xcite . moreover , in absence of the standard accretion disc , the system does not have to be aligned with the bh equatorial plane and the gas chunks can arrive episodically @xcite . in these circumstances",
    "one does not expect the bh and the ordered magnetic field to have a common symmetry axis ( the bardeen - petterson effect does not operate due to the lack of a steady accretion flow ) .",
    "neither we expect that the black hole is resting in the centre .",
    "the possibility of such mis - aligned accretion has been observed also in the simulations of geometrically thick accretion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the latter computations reveal a significant part of the equatorial plane near bh to be devoid of gas although their consistency is restricted by use of the pseudo - newtonian model ) .",
    "the possibility of rapid linear motion will be addressed later in the paper .",
    "we demonstrate that antiparallel field lines can be brought in mutual contact by the frame - dragging alone .",
    "separatrices and the associated null points occur roughly at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , where they can act as a place of particle acceleration .",
    "it is interesting to realise that even the ( asymptotically ) ordered magnetic field becomes so entangled by the bh gravity that the conditions for reconnection exist near the horizon .",
    "it is also pertinent to remark that the present - day techniques almost reach the necessary resolution of the order of one gravitational radius , at least in the case of the largest on the sky black hole , i.e.  sagittarius a * @xcite .",
    "we setup an idealised framework which maximises the action of frame - dragging due to the bh rotation while suppressing the mhd effects caused locally due to plasma motions .",
    "the gravitational field is described by the kerr metric , @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the specific angular momentum , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is for a non - rotating bh , while @xmath5 is for the maximally co / counter - rotating one ) , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . , and scale all quantities by the bh mass @xmath10 @xcite . the gravitational radius is @xmath11pc , and the corresponding light - crossing time - scale @xmath12sec , where @xmath13 .",
    "we use spheroidal coordinates with @xmath14 , @xmath15 . ] the outer horizon , @xmath16 , is where @xmath17 , whereas the isco ranges between @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the presence of terms @xmath19 in the metric ( [ metric ] ) indicates that the gr frame - dragging operates and affects the motion of particles as well as the structure of fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this influence on the accreted matter resembles a rotating viscous medium forcing the field lines to share the rotational motion , while at the same time the electric component is generated @xcite .",
    "we assume that the electromagnetic field does not contribute to the system gravity , which is correct for every astrophysically realistic situation . within a limited volume around the bh , typically of the size @xmath20 , the magnetic field lines exhibit a structure resembling the asymptotically uniform field .",
    "the electromagnetic field is a potential one and can be written as a superposition of two parts : the aligned component @xcite , plus the asymptotically perpendicular field @xcite .",
    "the four - potential is : @xmath21   + b_{\\perp}a\\sigma^{-1}\\psi\\sigma\\mu , \\label{mf1 } \\\\",

    "( [ mf1])([mf4 ] ) describe the electromagnetic field in vacuum .",
    "they were originally derived in the above - mentioned papers and further explored in various follow - ups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even if the vacuum fields are obviously a simplification as far as the realistic systems are concerned , they may actually capture some important aspects of the field outside dense plasma distributions , i.e. , away from the main body of the accretion flow .",
    "these properties are likely to persist as long as the magnetic field is dragged in a ( slightly ) different pace than the plasma itself ( the case of resistive magneto - hydrodynamics ) , although a detailed form of the realistic solution will be different .",
    "one can argue , and notice in the simulations , that whereas the currents in plasma do create a turbulent field structure in their immediate neighbourhood , as soon as one looks outside the plasma flow the field structure becomes simpler and organised on larger scales .",
    "most important for our arguments is the fact that the solution ( [ mf1])([mf4 ] ) includes the interaction of the bh strong gravity with the electromagnetic field , including the influence of the frame dragging .",
    "a question arises whether the ordered field configuration can efficiently accelerate the particles from the vicinity of the horizon .",
    "magnetic reconnection assisted by the gravitational frame dragging could help to solve this puzzle .",
    "the magnetic field is directed in a general angle with respect to the bh rotation axis",
    ". only few aspects of these misaligned magnetic fields have been explored so far ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the transversal component is wound up around the horizon and it is _ not _ expelled out of the horizon ( i.e. , the the transversal magnetic flux across the horizon does not vanish even in the extremely rotating case ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , the behaviour of the aligned component is simpler , the field being gradually expelled out of the horizon as the bh rotation increases @xcite .",
    "conductivity of the medium changes this property @xcite , and so non - vacuum fields are more complicated .    to obtain the physical components of the electromagnetic tensor , @xmath26",
    ", we project @xmath27 onto the local tetrad , @xmath28 .",
    "the appropriate choice of the projection tetrad is the one attached to a frame in keplerian orbital motion , which exists for @xmath29 . below @xmath30 the circular motion is unstable and the matter has to spiral downwards while maintaining constant angular momentum of @xmath31 . only in the extremely rotating case",
    "is the circular motion possible all the way down to @xmath32 .",
    "the electric and magnetic intensities , measured by a physical observer , are : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the observer s four - velocity ( the remaining three basis vectors can be chosen as space - like , mutually perpendicular vectors ) .",
    "the dependence of the electromagnetic components on the @xmath36-angle indicates the ever increasing effect of the frame dragging near the horizon .    assuming an ordered magnetic field is obviously a crude starting point , but a sensible one .",
    "it approximates the field generated by sources distant from the bh .",
    "the magnetic intensity of the organised component in real systems is quite uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by analogy",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we can expect @xmath37 gauss acting on length - scales of @xmath37@xmath38 gravitational radii near the galactic centre supermassive bh .",
    "this allows us to estimate the maximum energy to which a particle can be accelerated by an equipartition electric field acting along the distance @xmath39 , @xmath40  ev , where @xmath41 is in units of the elementary charge .",
    "naturally , this qualitative estimate is exceeded if a non - stationary field governs the acceleration process .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the typical structure of the field lines representing an asymptotically transverse field ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "albeit we have fixed the boundary condition corresponding to the homogeneous field outside the ergosphere , its near - horizon structure is much more dramatic .",
    "in fact , it is sensitive to the direction of the field with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "formation of the layers in the ergospheric region is an interesting feature of the rotating spacetime .",
    "two critical points can be seen occurring at radii up to @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows two plots that differ from each other only by the sense of the bh rotation .",
    "as mentioned above , we construct the field lines with respect to the frame orbiting freely in the equatorial plane .",
    "the two panels shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] are not merely a symmetrical inversions of each other , and this asymmetry is indeed due to the frame motion , which is oriented in the same ( positive ) sense in both examples .",
    "nonetheless , the alternating direction of the field lines arises in both cases .",
    "we notice that the gravito - magnetically induced electric field does not vanish along the magnetic lines , and it is thus capable of accelerating the charged particles .    in the outlined model we have imagined the origin of the magnetic field by amplification in the accreted plasma .",
    "however , recent studies in numerical relativity point to another possibility , namely , that a supermassive bh receives a high kick velocity .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite came to the conclusion that a black hole could gain a recoil velocity up to @xmath45 per cent of the speed of light as a result of an anisotropic emission of gravitational waves during the merger process .",
    "the merged bh is then ejected from the nucleus of a host galaxy @xcite . on its way out",
    ", the bh encounters regions where the interstellar magnetic field is enhanced ( the evidence for the localised magnetic field enhancements has been discussed e.g.  in the case of galaxy center bh magnetosphere ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in order to describe the interacting magnetic field in such circumstances",
    ", one needs to take the bh linear velocity into account .",
    "so far we neglected any translational motion of the bh .",
    "however , a fast - moving bhs can be included by generalising eqs .",
    "( [ mf1])([mf4 ] ) in a straightforward manner , allowing us to construct the magnetic field lines of the misaligned field near a bh in uniform motion .",
    "this motion can be taken into account by the lorentz boost of the field intensities @xmath46 , @xmath47 . to this end",
    "we notice that the lorentz transform , when applied in the asymptotically distant region , has two consequences on the field components : it ( i )  turns the direction of the uniform magnetic field , and ( ii )  generates a new electric component .",
    "the electromagnetic test field near a moving black hole , @xmath48 , is obtained as a superposition of two parts combined together in the due ratio , i.e.  the asymptotically uniform magnetic field , rotated into the desired direction , and the solution for the asymptotically uniform electric field ( @xmath49 denotes the matrix of lorentz boost to the desired velocity @xmath50 ) .",
    "the form of the latter is found by applying the dual transform to wald s field , which interchanges the role of magnetic and electric terms .",
    "albeit these are lengthy expressions , the field components with respect to the moving frame and the tetrad components @xmath51 can be written in the explicit form .",
    "we include the bh linear motion in figure  [ fig2 ] . in order to show the effect clearly , we choose high velocity , @xmath52 .",
    "let us note that the tightly layered structure of the magnetic field lines becomes quite confusing very near the horizon .",
    "alternatively , it can be plotted in terms of a new radial variable , @xmath53 .",
    "it allows us to stretch the complicated structure caused by the frame - dragging just above the horizon , as the latter is brought to the coordinate system origin ( for these plots and for the explicit form of the field components , see * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows a detail of the magnetic structure .",
    "as one proceeds towards the horizon , the magnetic layers become progressively narrow and eventually develop a magnetic null point .",
    "the most interesting case is shown in the right panel , where we capture a separatrix curve , distinguishing the location of the null point well above the horizon .",
    "for the latter plot we again set a constant velocity directed along the @xmath54-axis .",
    "the null point arises just above isco , located at @xmath55 for @xmath44 .",
    "translational velocity helps to stretch the magnetic lines further out from the horizon .",
    "we find that the null point can be as far as one gravitational radius from the horizon .",
    "the offset increases with @xmath2 and is also influenced by the black hole motion .",
    "the electric field is induced by the magnetic component , and in this sense the solution is self - consistent .",
    "particles are accelerated very efficiently by the electric field that remains non - vanishing across the neutral point .",
    "we do not show the associated electric field just because its lines do not reside in a single plane , and so the structure of the electric field is more difficult to visualise ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we expect reconnection to occur intermittently , as more plasma is injected into the dissipation region or created via the pair - cascades and two - photon reactions .",
    "the presumed source of additional material is the accretion disc truncated above the isco , or passing stars that are damaged by tidal forces . on the other hand , the physical origin of dissipation is a matter of long - lasting debate . under the conditions of a magnetically dominated collisionless medium",
    ", the anomalous reconnection is a promising scenario @xcite .",
    "reconnection has been observed also in the simulations of convection dominated flows of @xcite .",
    "however , in the latter work the mhd effects on the sheared plasma motion dominate the system evolution , while the approximation of pseudo - newtonian gravity does not permit to capture the frame - dragging effects .",
    "very recently , @xcite suggested that the magnetic reconnection may indeed be a relevant mechanism for the energy extraction from the ergosphere .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite restrict their discussion to the special - relativistic mhd framework .",
    "the formalism of resistive mhd has been applied to the bh accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in this case an interplay between mhd and gravitational effects should have a significant role .",
    "the regime of the intermittent reconnection from the almost evacuated ergosphere , as envisaged here in our paper , represents a complementary situation .",
    "we considered an interesting possibility that the immediate neighbourhood of a rotating bh may be threaded by an organised component of the magnetic field , the origin of which is in currents flowing outside the black hole .",
    "albeit more challenging to recognise than bhs in a standard accretion regime , the diluted gas in black hole ergospheres is an interesting possibility in which the turbulent motions are suppressed by the ordered field .",
    "hence , they could represent a suitable system to study the relativistic effects in a resistive plasma near the horizon , such as the meissner expulsion of the magnetic flux with the increasing angular momentum .",
    "even if we adopted an idealised system , we have seen that the magnetic structure becomes very rich just by pure interaction with the gravito - magnetic field .",
    "we examined the influence of bh rotation acting on the ordered magnetic field in the physical frame of matter orbiting a black hole , or plunging down to it . if rotation is fast enough , the magnetic layers and the corresponding null points exist just above the isco .",
    "although we prescribed a special configuration of the magnetic field , the process of warping the field lines is a general feature that should operate also in more complicated settings .",
    "the layered structure of the magnetic field lines with neutral points suggest this should become a site of particle acceleration .",
    "the essential ingredients of the model are the _ rotating black hole _ and the _ oblique magnetic field _ in which the bh is embedded .",
    "the interaction region is very near the horizon , representing , to our knowledge , the acceleration site nearest to the bh horizon among the variety of mechanisms proposed so far .",
    "for a rapidly rotating black hole the magnetic null point occurs above isco .",
    "our results demonstrate that the gravitational field of a rotating bh creates by itself a very complicated structure near the horizon .",
    "the assumed electrovacuum solution ( [ mf1])([mf4 ] ) captures the essential physical ingredients of our investigation , i.e.  the organised field near a rotation black hole .",
    "however , it should be quite obvious that the realistic field structure must differ from the one described in our paper .",
    "perfectly vacuum black holes are unlikely in any astrophysical system , as the horizon neighbourhood is expected to be continuously supplied with electron ",
    "positron pairs .",
    "we concentrated on the equatorial plane in which the transverse magnetic field lines reside , so they can be readily plotted , but this constraint was imposed only to keep the graphs as clean as possible . in spite of simplified geometry ,",
    "the processes taking place so close to the horizon are clearly difficult to investigate observationally .",
    "plasma motions near the bh are currently inaccessible to direct imaging but could be resolved by interferometric techniques in the future . with a planned accuracy of 10 micro - arcseconds , gravity will have a capability to carry out such type of observation in the near infrared domain .",
