    "experimental research topics require the capability of simulating electron interactions with matter over a wide range - from the nano - scale to the macroscopic one : some examples are ongoing investigations on nanotechnology - based particle detectors , scintillators and gaseous detectors , radiation effects on semiconductor devices , background effects on x - ray telescopes and biological effects of radiation .",
    "physics tools for the simulation of electron interactions are available in all monte carlo codes based on condensed and mixed transport schemes @xcite , like egs @xcite , fluka @xcite , geant4 @xcite , mcnpx @xcite , penelope @xcite and phits @xcite .",
    "general - purpose monte carlo codes based on these transport schemes typically handle particles with energy above 1 kev ; geant4 and penelope extend their coverage below this limit .",
    "in the lower energy end below 1 kev , so - called `` track structure '' codes handle particle interactions based on discrete transport schemes ; they provide simulation capabilities limited to a single target , or a small number of target materials , and are typically developed for specific application purposes .",
    "some examples of such codes are orec @xcite , partrac @xcite , grosswendt s monte carlo for nanodosimetry @xcite , tramos @xcite , and geant4 models for microdosimetry simulation in water @xcite .    the developments described in this paper address the problem of endowing a general purpose , large scale monte carlo system for the first time with the capability of simulating electron impact ionisation down to the scale of a few tens of electronvolts for any target element .",
    "for this purpose , models of electron impact ionization cross sections suitable to extend geant4 capabilities in the low energy range have been implemented and validated with respect to a large set of experimental measurements .",
    "the validation process , which involves experimental data pertinent to more than 50 elements , also addresses the ionization cross sections encompassed in the evaluated electron data library ( eedl ) @xcite , which are used in geant4 low energy electromagnetic package @xcite . to the best of the authors knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that eedl is subject to extensive experimental benchmarks below 1 kev .",
    "the geant4 toolkit provides various implementations of electron ionization based on a condensed - discrete particle transport scheme .",
    "two of them , respectively based on eedl @xcite and on the analytical models originally developed for the penelope @xcite monte carlo system , are included in the low energy electromagnetic package ; another implementation is available in the standard @xcite electromagnetic package . in addition , a specialized ionization model for interactions with thin layers of material , the photoabsorption - ionization ( pai ) model @xcite , is implemented in geant4 .",
    "the eedl data library tabulates electron ionization cross sections in the energy range between 10 ev and 100 gev ; nevertheless , due to intrinsic limitations of the accuracy of eedl and its companion evaluated photon data libray ( epdl ) @xcite highlighted in the documentation of these compilations , the use of geant4 low energy models based on them was originally recommended for incident electron energies above 250 ev @xcite .",
    "this limit of applicability was an `` educated guess '' rather than a rigorous estimate of validity of the theoretical calculations tabulated in eedl and epdl . the lower energy limit of penelope s applicability is generically indicated by its authors as `` a few hundred electronvolts '' @xcite",
    ". the lower limit of applicability of geant4 standard electromagnetic package is 1 kev .",
    "the validation of geant4 models for electron transport based on the eedl data library and on penelope - like models is documented in @xcite for what concerns the energy deposition in extended media .",
    "ionization models suitable for microdosimetry simulation , which operate in a discrete particle transport scheme , are available in geant4 for electron interactions in water @xcite ; they are applicable for energies down to the electronvolt scale .",
    "the cross section models implemented in that context are specific to one material ( liquid water ) ; due to lack of pertinent experimental data , their validation is still pending .",
    "the developments described in this paper adopt an iterative - incremental process consistent with the unified process @xcite .",
    "the features and results documented in the following sections correspond to the first cycle of a wider project concerning the development and assessment of models for multi - scale electron transport @xcite , which is motivated by multi - disciplinary experimental applications .",
    "a characterizing feature of the unified process , which differentiates it from other widespread software life - cycle models adopting a waterfall @xcite approach , is the production of concrete deliverables even at intermediate stages of the project : this development cycle has enabled the validation and comparative evaluation of different physics models , and has produced a data library usable in multiple environment .",
    "the software described and validated in the following sections is intended for release in the geant4 toolkit following the publication of this paper .",
    "the developed software tools concern the calculation and validation of cross sections for the ionization of an atom by electron impact at energies below 10 kev : they are focused on the total cross section for single ionization , namely the emission of one electron from a neutral atom , irrespective of the shell from which the electron is emitted .",
    "collective phenomena and solid state effects are outside their scope , as well as the treatment of electron interactions with matter other than ionization .    two ionization cross section models , which specifically address the low energy range , have been implemented : the binary - encounter - bethe ( beb ) model @xcite and the deutsch - mrk ( dm ) @xcite model .",
    "their accuracy at reproducing experimental data is extensively investigated in the following sections , along with the validation of the ionization cross sections included in eedl , currently used by geant4 .",
    "the theoretical models adopted in the software implementation have a wider scope of applicability : they can calculate cross sections for the ionization of individual shells as well as for multiple ionized atoms and for molecules .",
    "the assessment of these additional capabilities is intended to be the object of further cycles in the software process , to be documented in dedicated papers .",
    "the software adopts a policy - based class design @xcite ; this technique was first introduced in a general - purpose monte carlo system in @xcite .",
    "this programming paradigm allows the exploitation of the developed models in different contexts with great versatility , without imposing the burden of inheritance from a pre - defined interface , since policies are syntax - oriented , rather than signature - oriented .",
    "preliminary evaluations @xcite indicate that policy - based design contributes to achieve better computational performance than conventional inheritance in the calculation of cross sections , thanks to compile - time binding .",
    "this feature is relevant to the computationally intensive domain of monte carlo particle transport , especially at low energies , where discrete transport methods , involving a large number of steps and accounting for individual collisions with the interacting medium , may be required for precise calculation .",
    "the classes responsible for the calculation of ionization cross sections conform to the cross section policy defined in @xcite .",
    "the policy consists of a _ crosssection _ function , whose arguments are associated with characteristics of the incident particle and the target atom ; it returns the value of the cross section calculated in the conditions specified by the arguments .",
    "the binary - encounter - bethe and deutsch - mrk models are implemented according to the analytical formulations devised by their original authors .",
    "the implementation is based on the latest revisions of the models available in the literature .",
    "both cross section calculations involve a few atomic parameters ; the deutsch - mrk model also involves some empirical parameters derived from fits to experimental data .",
    "the software implementation is based on the parameters documented in the literature by the original authors of the theoretical models ; alternative sources were used in the software implementation , when the original sources are not publicly accessible , or not specified .",
    "the differences of the implementation with respect to the original models and their implications are discussed in detail in the following sections .",
    "the verification process ascertained whether the cross sections calculated by the software implementation of the beb and dm models are consistent with the original values published by the respective authors .",
    "the validation process involves comparisons with experimental data to ascertain whether the two new models and the eedl data library describe electron ionization cross sections accurately .",
    "the software verification and validation follow the guidelines of the pertinent ieee standard @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these two processes are intertwined : the verification of compatibility with original calculations can not be completly disjoint from the assessment whether any detected discrepancies would affect the model accuracy significantly with respect to experimental data .",
    "some of the reference cross section values for the verification and validation process , which are not available in numerical format , were digitized from published plots by means of the engauge @xcite software .",
    "the uncertainty associated with the digitization process was evaluated by digitizing plots whose entries were known a priori ; it is smaller than 1% .",
    "the binary - encounter - bethe model is a simplified version of the binary - encounter - dipole ( bed ) model @xcite proposed by kim and rudd to calculate electron impact ionisation cross sections .",
    "the bed model combines a modified form of the mott cross section @xcite with the bethe theory @xcite .",
    "mott theory describes the collision of two free electrons : it is expected to give good results for small impact parameters , or hard collisions , but it must be corrected for large impact parameters , or soft collision , where dipole interaction is prevalent , especially at high incident electron energies .",
    "several attempts have been made to simultaneously describe hard and soft collisions @xcite , but they generally failed in finding the proper mixing between these two different physical situations .",
    "the bed model was proposed to describe in a parameter - free fashion the impact of a free electron on a bound one : it is able to determine the proper mixing by requiring the asymptotic behaviour of the ionization cross section to coincide with the one obtained in bethe s theory , but some issues remain open on how to describe within the model the fact that the outgoing primary and secondary electrons are undistinguishable .",
    "this crucial feature is included only in the mott cross section .",
    "these shortcomings can explain the observed difference between the predictions of the bed and deutsch - mrk model , which , as discussed in the following section , is to a large extent a phenomenological description of ionization processes .",
    "the bed model prescribes procedures to evaluate the energy distribution of the ejected electron for each subshell using the binding energy , average kinetic energy and dipole oscillator strength for each subshell .",
    "the agreement of bed with known experimental data is of the order of 10% in the region from the threshold to some kev .",
    "the oscillator strengths required in the bed formula can be obtained by theoretical calculations or experimental photoionization cross sections ; nevertheless , they are not easily available for every atom and for each subshell .",
    "although the bed model shows qualitatively good agreement with experimental data for many atoms ( e.g. h , he , ne , rb ) @xcite , the difficult availability of these components of its formulation limits its practical use .",
    "the beb model @xcite was proposed as a simplification of the bed model , when the differential dipole oscillator strength is unknown .",
    "it assumes a simple form for the oscillator strengths , which approximates the shape of the oscillator strength for ionization of the ground state of hydrogen .    the beb cross section for the ionization of subshell _ i _ is given by : @xmath0 ( hee : is there an extra /n in the first coeffcient ? )",

    "a@xmath3 _ is the bohr radius and _ r _ is the rydberg constant .",
    "the beb model involves three atomic parameters for each subshell of the target atom , as shown in ( [ eq_beb ] ) : the electron binding energy _ b _ , the average electron kinetic energy _ u _ and the occupation number _",
    "n_. the sum over all subshells _ i _ gives the total cross section ; in practice , only the valence shell and a few outer subshells contribute significantly to determine the total cross section value .    in equation ( [ eq_beb ] ) , the term associated with the first logarithmic function represents distant collisions ( i. e. large impact parameters ) dominated by the dipole interaction , and the rest of the terms represent close collisions described by the mott cross section ; the second logarithmic function originates from the interference of direct and exchange scattering .",
    "the beb cross section model is implemented according to ( [ eq_beb ] ) .",
    "the atomic parameters originally used by the authors of the model have been documented in the literature only for a small number of target elements ; therefore , to satisfy the requirement of general applicability in a large scale monte carlo system , alternative compilations of parameters , covering the whole periodic system , are utilized in the software implementation .",
    "the electron binding energies ( except for the valence electron ) and average electron kinetic energies appearing in the original formulation of the binary - encounter - bethe model derive from relativistic dirac - fock calculations @xcite ; since the original numerical values are not publicly available , they were replaced in the code implementation by the values reported in in the evaluated atomic data library ( eadl ) @xcite .",
    "eadl was also used in the software implementation to retrieve the occupation numbers of each subshell , since the source of these parameters in the original beb calculations is not explicitly documented in the literature .",
    "the choice of eadl in the software implementation as an alternative source of the atomic parameters was mainly dictated by the limited availability of compilations of mean electron energies covering the whole periodic system ; other parameters , such as atomic binding energies and occupation numbers , were taken from the same source for consistency .    both in the original formulation of the model and in the software implementation the binding energy for the valence electron is obtained from the compilation of experimental ionization energies @xcite included in the nist ( national institute of standards and technology ) physics reference data .",
    "the correctness of the beb model implementation was verified by comparing quantitatively cross sections calculated with the same atomic parameters ( binding energies , ionization potentials and electron kinetic energies ) used by the original authors with reference values published in the literature .",

    "the dm model has its origin in a classical binary encounter approximation derived by thomson @xcite and its improved form by gryzinski @xcite .",
    "the current expression of the dm formula calculates the atomic cross section @xmath4 for single ionization as the sum over all partial ionization cross sections corresponding to the removal of a single electron from a given atomic subshell , characterized by quantum numbers @xmath2 and @xmath5 as : @xmath6    in this formula @xmath7 is the radius of maximum radial density of the atomic subshell with quantum numbers @xmath2 and @xmath5 and @xmath8 is the electron occupation number in that subshell ; @xmath9 are weighting factors , which were determined by the original authors from a fitting procedure @xcite using experimental cross section data .",

    "occupation numbers are also taken from nist physics reference data , while their source is not explicitly documented in the original formulation .",
    "weighting factors in the software implementation are taken from original publications @xcite and@xcite ( the former limited to the 7s orbital ) ; although more recent values have been determined by the original authors@xcite , they could not be utilized in the current implementation , as they are not publicly documented .",
    "the formulation of the dm model was revised in 2004 ; therefore , only cross section values published since then @xcite were considered as a reference in the software verification process .",

    "[ fig_dmorig_diff ] , in more than 2/3 of the test cases the average difference between original and calculated values is smaller than 5% ; nevertheless , for a few target elements ( namely argon , cerium and gadolinium ) it is greater than 20% .",
    "goodness - of - fit tests comparing the distributions of original and calculated cross sections confirm the rejection of the null hypothesis of compatibility with 0.05 significance in these cases exhibiting large discrepancies .",
    "the most probable source of the observed discrepancies between original and calculated values is the different set of weighting factors used in the software implementation and in recent deutsch - mrk calculations , as discussed in section [ sec_impldm ] .",
    "this assumption was tested by empirically adjusting the weighting factors values in the software implementation ; as a result of this operation , cross section values compatible within 1% with recently published reference ones could be obtained for the elements exhibiting large discrepancies in fig .",
    "[ fig_dmorig_diff ] . nevertheless , for better traceability of the results of the software , the published weighting factors of @xcite and@xcite were retained in the implementation .",
    "the role of these discrepancies on the capability of the dm model implementation to reproduce experimental data is discussed in section [ sec_results ] .",
    "the evaluated electron data library includes tabulations of ionization cross sections resulting from theoretical calculations .    for close collisions , the calculations use seltzer s modification @xcite of mller s binary collision cross section @xcite , which takes into consideration the binding of atomic electrons in a given subshell . for distant collisions ,",
    "they use seltzer s modification @xcite of weizscker - williams method @xcite ; this approach is similar to the bed model in that it requires knowledge of the dipole oscillator strengths of the target , but , being primarily designed for high energy incident electrons , it may lead to unrealistic results below a few hundred ev .",
    "calculations by scofield @xcite were used to take into account the density effect ; this correction is significant for inner shell cross sections for incident electron energies above a few hundred mev , but this effect sets in at lower energies for outer shells .",
    "the electron ionization cross sections calculated by the beb and dm models , and those tabulated in eedl are validated through comparison with experimental data .",
    "cross sections for the ionization of atoms based on the beb and dm models have been previously subject to comparison with experimental measurements ( e.g. @xcite ) ; these comparisons involve a limited number of target elements and experimental data sets , and rely on qualitative visual appraisal of the compatibility between models and measurements .",
    "they concern calculations performed by the original authors , which , as discussed in the previous sections , in some cases can not be reproduced , as not all the original parameters in the model formulation are publicly documented .    to the best of the authors knowledge , the accuracy of the eedl ionization cross section calculations has not yet been quantitatively documented in the literature .    the validation process described in this paper concerns the cross sections calculated by the software implementation , which , being intended for open source release along with the publication of this paper , are reproducible .",
    "it involves a wider collection of experimental data than previously published comparisons and concerns a larger number of elements ; moreover , the compatibility between the models and experimental measurements is estimated quantitatively , based on statistical analysis methods .",
    "the validation of the three electron ionization cross section models is based on a large set of experimental data @xcite -@xcite collected in the literature .",
    "the experiments were performed with different techniques and measured a variety of physical observables , which are not always exhaustively documented in the related publications .",
    "some papers do not report the uncertainties of the measurements .",
    "the reference data include measurements of single ionization , i.e. the emission of a single electron as a result of the primary electron s impact , as well as experiments that did not distinguish whether more than one electron had been emitted from the target atom . when multiple ionization is involved , a further possible source of ambiguity depends on whether the measurements concerned the so - called `` total counting '' cross section , which accounts for the number of ions produced , @xmath22 or the so - called `` total gross '' cross section , which is determined by measuring the total ion current , @xmath23 where @xmath2 represents the number of ionizations .",
    "multiple ionization is generally small with respect to single ionization : for instance , for several elements cross sections for double ionization amount to a few percent of those for single ionization , and cross sections for triple ionization are approximately an order of magnitude smaller than for double ionization @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the contribution of double ionization may be significant for some elements : for instance , it represents more than 20% of single ionization for lead @xcite .",
    "some experiments measured absolute cross sections ; some report relative values with respect to other references , which are either experimental or theoretical calculations .",
    "both techniques have drawbacks : the intrinsic difficulty of making accurate absolute cross section measurements and the possibility of introducing a systematic bias in relative measurements .",
    "other features likely to be associated with systematic effects can be identified in contradictory measurements of single and total ( counting or gross ) ionization cross sections : in some cases ( for instance , as reported in @xcite and @xcite ) the experimental cross section for single ionization appears larger than measurements of total gross or counting cross section , of which single ionization should be a component .",
    "large discrepancies are evident in some of the experimental data .",
    "some data sets pertaining to the same target element are patently inconsistent ; systematic effects are likely present in some cases , where the wald - wolfowitz test @xcite detects sequences of positive or negative differences between experimental data sets , which are incompatible with randomness .",
    "the wide heterogeneity of the experimental data complicates the validation process ; it suggests caution in the interpretation of results of agreement , or disagreement , of the theoretical models with individual measurements , and induce to privilege a statistical analysis over a wide experimental sample as an indicator of the reliability of the theoretical models for use in particle transport .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      apart from direct ionization , which accounts for the ejection of a bound electron directly into the continuum , additional indirect channels of ionization may be important for open - shell atoms , such as the excitation of an inner - shell electron to an upper bound state that leads to autoionization @xcite . their contribution",
    "is generally included in the experimental measurements of total cross section for single ionization , which do not distinguish direct and indirect channels .",
    "contributions of indirect channels are not taken into account by the beb model , which describes only cross sections for direct ionization , while their non explicit treatment could be partly mitigated by the semi - empirical nature of the deutsch - mrk model .",
    "the results of the validation process in some way reflect this different approach of the beb and dm model towards the physics phenomena that contribute to experimentally measured ionization cross sections",
    ".    the neglected contribution of excitation - autoionization could be also a reason for the rather poor compatibility of eedl with experiment below 250 ev ; nevertheless , no firm conclusion can be drawn in this respect due to the scarce documentation of how eedl tabulations have been calculated .",
    "methods to calculate cross sections for excitation - autoionization are documented in the literature @xcite and would be considered in future development cycles to include this process among the interactions treated by geant4 .",
    "the minimalist character of the software design and its minimal dependencies on other parts of geant4 facilitate the exploitation of the developments described in this paper .",
    "the developed cross section classes can be used in association with the geant4 toolkit for the simulation of electron ionization as a discrete process , through the mechanism of a policy host class as described in @xcite .",
    "the beb and dm cross section code can also be exploited for the creation of data libraries to be used in the current geant4 scheme , thus extending geant4 simulation capabilities below the current 250 ev limit recommended for the use of the eedl library .    a data library consisting of tabulations of ionization cross section calculated by the beb and dm models has been produced exploiting the software developments described in this paper ; the cross sections are tabulated at the same energies as in the eedl data library .",
    "this data library can be used at the place of the current eedl data in connection with existing implementations of geant4 ionization process , thus giving access to the extended energy coverage and the improved accuracy of the new models in a transparent way .",
    "its possible use is not limited to geant4 ; given its wider interest , it is intended to be publicly distributed independently from geant4 through the radiation safety information computational center ( rsicc ) following the publication of this paper .",
    "two models for the calculation of the cross sections for the ionization of atoms by electron impact , specialized in the low energy range , have been implemented : the binary - encounter - bethe model and the deutsch - mrk model .",
    "these models are intended to extend and improve the current capabilities of geant4 for precision simulation of electron interactions .",
    "the cross sections calculated by these models , as well as those included in the evaluated electron data library , have been subject to extensive validation in the energy range from a few ev to 10 kev .    among the cross section models analyzed in this paper ,",
    "the validation analysis has identified the deutsch - mrk model as the most accurate for modeling electron ionization over the whole energy range considered in the test .",
    "the eedl cross sections exhibit statistically equivalent accuracy in the energy range above 250 ev , in which they were originally recommended for use in geant4 ; they are not adequately accurate to extend their usage below this threshold . in the lower energy",
    "end the binary encounter bethe models exhibits statistically equivalent accuracy with respect to the deutsch - mrk one ; nevertheless , its performance appears to degrade at higher energies , presumably because it does not account for other channels than direct ionization .",
    "possible sources of systematic effects , which could affect the accuracy of the implementation of the theoretical models or the outcome of the validation process , have been analyzed .",
    "the values of atomic parameters , namely atomic binding energies , play a significant role in determining the accuracy of the calculated cross sections .",
    "a cross section data library has been developed , containing tabulations of ionization cross sections calculated by the software described in this paper ; it is meant for public release following the publication of this paper .",
    "the availability of cross section tabulations in a publicly distributed data library would extend the possibility of using them in other simulation systems than geant4 .",
    "the models investigated in this paper provide more extended capabilities , that have not been exploited yet in the first development cycle described in this paper : they can describe the ionization of molecules , which could be of interest for the simulation of gaseous detectors and plasma interactions , and can calculate cross section for the ionization of inner shells , thus enabling the simulation of atomic relaxation determined by a vacancy in the shell occupation .",
    "such extensions and improvements , as well as the development of complementary models for final state generation , are intended to be the object of further developments .",
    "the described developments for the first time endow a general - purpose monte carlo simulation system of the capability of modeling electron ionization down to the energy scale relevant to nanodosimetry , for target elements spanning the whole periodic system .",
    "nevertheless , it is worthwhile to recall that other phenomena , apart from direct ionization of atoms , should be taken into account for realistic simulation of particle interactions at very low energies : further effort should be invested for geant4 to achieve full functionality for particle transport at nano - scale .    due to the already significant length of this paper and its focus on cross section modeling and validation ,",
