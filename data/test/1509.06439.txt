    "layered semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) such as mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 , wse@xmath0 and mote@xmath0 have become a subject of intensive study recently due to their interesting optical properties rich in spin and valley physics , which largely results from the indirect to direct band gap crossover upon decreasing thickness from bulk to the monolayer ( 1l).@xcite thin layers of these materials have shown new interesting physical phenomena such as valley polarization@xcite and valley coherence@xcite effects or tightly bound trions.@xcite it has also been domenstrated that they can serve as efficient sources of light , either in the form of light emitting diodes@xcite or single photon emitters,@xcite which is potentially promising towards technological advances such as in optical computation and valleytronics .",
    "as such , the optical properties of tmdcs are dominated by many excitonic resonances over a rather small spectral region ( a few ev ) .",
    "therefore , a full comprehensive picture of the electronic band structure requires a detailed experimental study of excitons , and their excited states as a function of layer thickness and temperature , which has received very limited attention so far . in this letter",
    ", we present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of many excitonic ground state and excited state features , spanning the spectra of good quality 1l to 5l thick flakes of 2 .",
    "this information finds importance for an improved theoretical understanding of excitons and charged excitons where large discrepancies have been found between the experimental and limited theoretical results ( such as exciton binding energies).@xcite interestingly , for the a - exciton transition in our monolayer flakes , we find an unusual reflectance spectral lineshape , which is tentatively attributed to the appearance of a fano - type resonance.@xcite this could arise since the a - exciton lies in the energy region spanned by the excited and the continuum states of the trion , where a strong interaction could exist.@xcite temperature dependent evolution of the spectrum of the monolayer flake is consistent with the fano hypothesis .",
    "recent theoretical works suggest that in addition to strong spin - orbit splitting in the valence band ( vb ) of tmdcs , there is also a splitting in the conduction band ( cb ) ( up to @xmath140  mev).@xcite the sign of this splitting is expected to decide weather the energetically favorable exciton is optically active ( bright ) or inactive ( dark ) which has a strong influence on the pl properties of the material .",
    "our temperature - dependent studies on the monolayer 2 are consistent with the theoretical predictions that the ground state exciton in this material is optically bright , which is found to be opposite to the case of 2 monolayers.@xcite we also derive the temperature activated energy shifts and linewidth broadenings of the ground state excitons from 1l to 3l thick flakes and explain them on the basis of standard formalisms used for conventional semiconductors .",
    "the thicknesses of the mono- to few - layer 2 flakes were established using optical contrast , atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and raman spectroscopy techniques .",
    "fig.[figpl](a ) shows the raman spectra obtained for the flakes under consideration .",
    "the raman lines corresponding to the a@xmath2 , e@xmath3 and b@xmath3 phonon modes were observed in consistence with ref .  .",
    "the monolayer thickness was found to be @xmath10.65  nm using afm ( data not shown ) .",
    "the flakes were then characterized using spectroscopy ( see methods ) .",
    "figure [ figpl ] ( b - d ) displays the spectra of 1l to 3l thick flakes . for the 1l flake , two well separated features corresponding to the emission from the n  =  1 ground state a - exciton and the charged exciton ( trion , t ) are observed .",
    "the emission intensity in the case of 2l flake is lower than for the 1l by about 4000 times .",
    "a feature corresponding to the indirect gap emission ( i ) is observed , which is red shifted relative to the direct - gap emission peak a by @xmath1180  mev .",
    "interestingly , in the spectra of some of the 2l flakes ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ figpl](b ) ) , we also observed two features which coincide with the a and t emission features of the monolayer , but are around 4 orders of magnitude weaker .",
    "these features existed throughout the area of rather large flakes ( @xmath130  @xmath4 m wide ) , therefore the contribution due to the neighbouring 1l flakes can be ruled out .",
    "our hypothesis is that the process of mechanical exfoliation led to the formation of some pockets within the 2l flakes , which act as two separated monolayers giving rise to a monolayer like emission .",
    "the spectrum of the 3l flake was similar to that of the 2l flake where a and i emission features were observed .",
    "the i feature was red shifted with respect to a by @xmath1330  mev .",
    "we did not observe any measurable emission from the flakes with thicknesses larger than 3ls .",
    "figure [ figlayerdepref](a ) shows the reflectance contrast spectra of the 2 flakes with layer thicknesses up to 5ls , except a 4l flake .",
    "the spectra are dominated by many excitonic resonance features . to determine the resonance energies , we fitted the spectra using a transfer matrix method which accounted for the interference effects on the exciton lineshapes due to the multilayered structure of the sample as reported earlier.@xcite in our method , the excitonic contribution to the dielectric function was considered to be a modified lorentzian function@xcite ( see methods section ) , where a phase factor @xmath5 was used to account for the peculiar lineshape of the a - exciton feature in the case of 1l flake ( discussed later ) , and was set to be equal to 0 for all other features ( except a@xmath6 for 1l , where @xmath5 was assumed to be equal to that for a - exciton ) . it is tempting to derive the reflectivity and absorption spectra of the bare flakes ( without substrate ) from the spectral modeling .",
    "these spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ figlayerdepref](b ) and ( c ) respectively where the absorption coefficient @xmath7 is calculated by deriving the imaginary part of the refractive index , @xmath8 , from the modeling .",
    "one can clearly observe the features corresponding to the transitions taking place at various points of the brillouin zone , which have been identified earlier for bulk 2 based on low temperature transmission measurements and theoretical calculations.@xcite following these reports , the observed transitions are named as a , b , a@xmath9 , b@xmath9 , d , c and d in the order of increasing energy .",
    "2l have been shifted / amplified along for clarity by amounts shown above the curves on the left side .",
    "( d ) shows the energies of corresponding exciton features as a function of layer thickness .",
    "black diamonds represent the positions of broad features in the spectra , which possibly arise from overlaps between a few closely lying transitions.,width=321 ]    the shoulders a@xmath6 and b@xmath6 towards the higher energy sides of a and b excitons arise from the contributions due to the excited state exciton ( n@xmath102 ) transitions .",
    "an evolution of the transition energies with the layer thickness is shown in fig .",
    "[ figlayerdepref](b ) .",
    "the transition energies for the bulk 2 have been obtained from a previous report.@xcite we notice that contrary to the case of wse@xmath0@xcite , where the a and b exciton resonances display a monotonic red shift when layer thickness is increased , their behavior in 2 is different .",
    "the a - exciton feature shows an overall red shift ( @xmath158  mev ) when the thickness is increased from a monolayer towards bulk , except in going from 2l to 3l where it shows a slight blue shift ( @xmath15  mev ) .",
    "furthermore , the b - exciton displays an initial blue shift from 1l to 3l ( @xmath18  mev ) , which is then followed by a red shift ( @xmath113  mev ) from 3l to bulk .",
    "similarly , the a@xmath9 and b@xmath9 features show an initial blue shift from 1l to 2l thickness , and a red shift for thicker flakes .",
    "although , a detailed theoretical analysis is required to completely understand this phenomenon , it can be qualitatively explained by considering the following two effects : ( i ) a red shift of the band - to - band absorption edge and ( ii ) a decreasing excitonic binding energy as the material undergoes a 2d to 3d transition , when the thickness is increased from a monolayer to the bulk limit.@xcite the excitonic transition appears at an energy lower than the absorption edge by an amount equal to the excitonic binding energy .",
    "therefore , depending upon the magnitudes of the two effects , one can either observe a red or a blue shift of the excitonic transition . in our case of the a - exciton transition",
    ", the first effect appears to be much stronger than the second one resulting in a monotonous red shift .",
    "however , for b - exciton ( a@xmath9 and b@xmath9 excitons ) , the second effect dominates initially up to 3l ( 2l ) thickness resulting in a blue shift , whereas the first one takes over later on which leads to a red shift . for the 1l flake , a broad feature which appears around 2.7  ev ( shown by diamond in fig .",
    "[ figlayerdepref](b ) ) is most likely due to unresolved contributions from d- and c- type exciton features .",
    "a pair of d - exciton features could be resolved for thicker flakes whereas those related to the c - excitons resulted in a broad feature around 2.8  ev for 3l and 5l flakes ( shown by diamonds in fig .",
    "[ figlayerdepref](b ) ) .",
    "d - exciton features were identified around 3.2  ev for all the flakes but were not accounted for in our modeling .",
    "their positions were assumed to be at their minima and may be subjected to large errors .",
    "now we discuss the a@xmath6 and b@xmath6 features in fig .",
    "[ figlayerdepref ] which we associate with the spectral contributions due to the n@xmath102 excited states of the a and b excitons .",
    "the energies of these features agree quite well with those determined recently using 2-photon absorption measurements.@xcite although the a@xmath6 feature could be observed for flakes with all thicknesses from 1l to 5l , b@xmath6 could only be seen for the 1l and 2l flakes and was too weak to be identified for thicker flakes .",
    "also , only one feature ( 2s - like ) could be identified for the a - exciton for flakes of all thicknesses , whereas for the b - exciton in the 1l flake , both 2s and 3s features could be observed , blue shifted by @xmath1150  mev and @xmath1210  mev respectively with respect to the 1s feature .",
    "the exciton series for 1l b - exciton significantly deviates from the 2d rydberg model for a hydrogen atom in consistence with recent reports on 1l ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0,@xcite which renders it difficult to predict the exciton s binding energy without information about more ( n@xmath113 ) excited state features .",
    "however , following the ideal 2d rydberg model for the a - exciton ( considering 1s and 2s states ) and b - exciton ( considering 1s and 3s states ) , we find that their binding energies should be greater than @xmath12100  mev and @xmath12210  mev respectively . in analogy with our earlier findings for wse@xmath0,@xcite the energy difference between the 2s state feature shows an initial blue shift relative to the 1s feature , in going from 1l to 2l flake , for both a and b excitons .",
    "this is followed by a red shift in the case of the a - exciton , when the thickness is increased from 2l to 5l .",
    "this phenomenon is explained on the basis of two competing effects : ( i ) the non - local dielectric screening of the exciton excited states for the 1l flake pushes the 2s state closer to 1s state,@xcite and ( ii ) the material undergoes a 2d to 3d transition while transforming from the 1l to the bulk form .",
    "the first effect dominates when the thickness is increased from 1l to 2l whereas the second one takes over for thicker flakes resulting in a red shift .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figlayerdepref](a to c ) , our standard analysis of the reflectance spectra ( with @xmath13 ) provides a consistent picture of all observed excitonic transitions but clearly , this does not apply to the case of the a - exciton of the monolayer ( with @xmath14 at low temperatures , see below ) .",
    "the features related to all ( but monolayer a - exciton ) imply the absorption resonances in the form of lorentzian peaks .",
    "in contrast , the deduced absorption spectral shape of the 1l a - exciton resonance is unusual , displaying a dispersive - like form . it also shows a negative dip towards the higher energy side of resonance [ fig .  [",
    "figlayerdepref](c ) ] , but for simplicity , we have not considered any absorption background in our modeling which will result in all positive absorption values . among known sources of unusual ( non - lorentzian ) shapes of excitonic resonances",
    "are the effects of significant light - exciton coupling ( polaritons ) and/or the interaction of the discrete resonance with a continuum of other states ( fano resonance ) .",
    "polaritonic effects may be relevant in the reflectance spectra of bulk materials @xcite but can generate only subtle effects in two - dimensional systems @xcite unless the latter are embedded into a microcavity,@xcite which is not the case of our structures .",
    "we thus speculate that the observed unusual shape of the a - exciton in 1l 2 is due to fano - type effect .",
    "the excitonic resonances of the fano shape can indeed be observed in two - dimensional systems .",
    "the best known examples are the fano - type resonances of the excited excitonic states coupled to the continuum of the ground state heavy- and light - hole excitons in gaas / gaalas quantum wells.@xcite in search for a continuum of states which possibly couple to the a - exciton in the monolayer ( and not in other layers ) , we note that it is only the monolayer which displays a prominent , below a - exciton absorption peak , related to the charged exciton t. obviously , there must exist the excited states of the t , including the predicted quasi - continuum of unbound t states which markedly coincide in energy with the undressed neutral exciton resonance.@xcite the effective coupling of the a - exciton with the quasi - continuum of excited states of the trion is our hypothesis to account for the unusual shape of the a - exciton in our 1l structure .",
    "temperature dependent studies confirm this conjuncture on a phenomenological ground . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtdepref](a ) , the  unusual shape \" of the 1l a - exciton transforms into a standard form upon increasing temperature in parallel to the progressive disappearance of the charged exciton resonance .",
    "this is accompanied with a gradual reduction of @xmath5 from @xmath190@xmath15 to 0@xmath15 . at temperatures above 200  k ,",
    "when the trion is totally absent in the spectra ( and the quasi continuum of its excited states must have disappeared ) , the a exciton fully recovers its usual shape .",

    "fig .  [ figtdepref](b ) and ( c ) show the temperature evolution of the a - exciton features of the 2l and 3l thick flakes . in the case of a 2l flake at low temperatures",
    "( t@xmath16140  k ) , the main exciton feature is accompanied with two small features at the higher energy side .",
    "similarly to what has already been observed in the data ( fig .",
    "[ figpl](b ) ) , their energies coincide with the a - exciton and the trion in the 1l flake . for the 3l flake",
    ", we also observe the evolution of the a@xmath6 feature along with the a - exciton in our spectral window . from modeling of these spectra",
    ", we deduce the transition energies and the linewidth broadenings of the excitons as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtdepref](e ) and ( f ) respectively .",

    "similar to what has been observed for 2,@xcite @xmath25 which quantifies the extent of lo - phonon assisted scattering of the ground state exciton with the excited states , increases from 1l to 3l flake .",
    "this is because the number of excited states available for scattering increase with increasing flake thickness .",
    "however , @xmath25 is lower for a@xmath6 than for a feature in the 3l flake .",
    "it suggests that the excited state feature has lesser number of available bound and continuum excited states for undergoing lo - phonon assisted scattering , as compared to the ground state feature .",

    "[ figtdeppl ] .",
    "the inset to the fig .",
    "[ figtdeppl ] shows the integrated emission intensity from the trion ( i@xmath29 ) , the exciton ( i@xmath28 ) , and the total intensity ( i@xmath31 , area over full spectral range ) as a function of temperature .",
    "the remaining emission intensity [ i@xmath31-(i@xmath28+i@xmath29 ) ] is attributed to the defect related luminescence ( i@xmath30 ) , which contributes towards the low energy side ( below trion ) of the spectrum and could result in a slightly asymmetrical trion emission lineshape.@xcite the pl spectrum is initially dominated by trion s contribution at low temperature , which is quickly quenched with increasing temperature and becomes negligible when compared to the exciton s contribution for t@xmath11200  k. for t@xmath1170  k , the exciton begins to dominate the spectrum due to quick thermal redistribution of charge carriers in the k - space.@xcite we notice that there is a slight increase in the i@xmath31 ( @xmath1i@xmath28 ) from 200  k to 250  k ( notice log - scale ) .",
    "although this phenomenon is not well understood at this stage , we note that the change of the pl intensity upon increase of temperature results from the competition between the efficiencies of the radiative and non - radiative recombination channels , the latter being particularly poorly known in the investigated structures . the observed rise of the pl intensity may therefore be a result of distinct temperature dependencies of these two recombination channels .",
    "overall , i@xmath31 shows a net drop by a factor of @xmath32 when temperature was increased from 5  k to 300  k. this is in agreement with another recent report@xcite and is opposite to what we have reported in the case of monolayer 2 where i@xmath31 showed a gradual increase as a function of temperature.@xcite it can be explained as follows .",
    "it has been predicted theoretically that the conduction band ( cb ) in the monolayers of tmdcs also splits into two bands due to spin - orbit interaction.@xcite however , the sign of this splitting has been predicted to be opposite for 2 and 2 .",
    "therefore , the states of lower energy among these spin - orbit split cb states have opposite total angular momenta , due to which the lowest energy exciton transitions for 2 and 2 are expected to be bright and dark respectively.@xcite typically , the integrated pl intensity in semiconductors shows a reduction when temperature is increased , due to increasing contribution from the non - radiative recombination processes .",
    "if the lowest lying cb state results in the formation of dark excitons in combination with the state at the top of the spin - orbit split valence band ( vb ) , the pl intensity may be quenched at low temperatures where this radiatively inefficient state is preferentially filled with charge carriers . upon increasing the temperature ,",
    "the carriers may get transferred to the higher energy cb state upon thermalization , which opens up a radiatively favorable channel for their recombination and may result in an enhancement of emission intensity ( which has been observed for 2 ) .",
    "therefore , contrary to 2 , a gradual increase of intensity with increasing temperature is in agreement with the theoretical predictions that the lower energy exciton in 2 is bright .",
    "in conclusion , we studied 2 flakes with thicknesses equal to a monolayer , 2ls , 3ls and 5ls using and spectroscopy and as a function of temperature .",
    "we observed the evolution of various ground - state resonance features called a , b , a@xmath9 , b@xmath9 , d , c and d as well as the excited - state counterparts of some of them i.e. a@xmath6 and b@xmath6 , as a function of layer thickness .",
    "the a - exciton feature in the spectrum of the 1l flake showed fano - type lineshape at low temperatures .",
    "this hypothesis was supported using temperature dependence measurements . in addition , the transition energies and linewidth broadenings of selected excitonic resonances in a 1l to 3l thick flakes were determined as a function of temperature and their behavior was explained using the models routinely used for conventional semiconductors . finally , our temperature dependent measurements are consistent with the theoretical predictions that the lowest energy exciton in 1l 2 is bright .",
    "the monolayer and a few layers 2 flakes were obtained on si/(100  nm)sio@xmath0 substrate by polidimethylosiloxan - based exfoliation@xcite of bulk crystals purchased from hq graphene .",
    "the flakes of interest were first identified by visual inspection under an optical microscope .",
    "a transfer matrix based calculation was performed to predict the color of the flake as a function of its thickness.@xcite the observed color of the flake was then compared with the theoretically predicted one to roughly estimate the number of layers in the flakes .",
    "then the afm characterization and raman spectroscopy were performed on the flakes of interest to unambiguously determine their thicknesses .",
    "the raman spectroscopy was performed at room temperature using an argon ion laser ( 514.5  nm , 0.2  mw focused using a 50x microscope objective ) , with a 0.5  m focal length monochromator and a 1800 lines / mm grating . for performing measurements",

    "the measurements were performed at temperatures ranging from 5  k to 300  k. for the lineshape analysis of the rc spectra , we followed a method similar to that described in ref .  .",
    "in this method , we considered the excitonic contribution to the dielectric response function to be given by a modified lorentz oscillator like model as @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents the background complex refractive index of 2 in the absence of excitons and was assumed to be equal to that of the bulk material@xcite in the simulations .",
