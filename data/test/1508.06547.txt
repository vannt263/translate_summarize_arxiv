    "consider the case of negative mass squared : @xmath248 .",
    "the potential has a @xmath249 symmetry @xmath250 if @xmath1 is even .",
    "if @xmath4 obtains a large initial value during inflation and @xmath251 , it oscillates around the symmetric point @xmath252 after inflation and large fluctuations of @xmath4 particles ( and other particles which interact with @xmath4 ) are induced due to the efficient particle production .",
    "such large fluctuations may cause the non - thermal restoration of the symmetry and @xmath4 may be trapped at the origin ( @xmath252 )  @xcite .",
    "the trapping effect becomes diluted as the universe expands , and @xmath4 finally rolls down to the minimum of the potential .",
    "eventually , the domain wall is formed and the universe is expected to be overclosed .",
    "this is the rough picture of the domain wall problem we consider here .",
    "a physically well - motivated example is the peccei - quinn ( pq ) field , which often leads to the axionic domain wall problem  @xcite due to the nonthermal restoration of the pq symmetry  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "for @xmath253 , the scalar field @xmath4 obeys the pseudo scaling law . as we saw earlier , the energy density of @xmath31 is negative for a reasonable initial condition ( see eq .  ) .",
    "hence @xmath4 never crosses the origin during the pseudo scaling and no particle production occurs .",
    ", no efficient particle production is expected to occur since the period of the oscillation is much longer than the cosmic time in the case of the pseudo scaling solution .",
    "] moreover , even after the dynamics is dominated by the mass term , @xmath4 never crosses the origin because the mass term also prevents @xmath31 from crossing the origin ( see eq .  ) .",
    "the field @xmath4 just oscillates around @xmath254 and the domain wall problem does not occur .",
    "therefore , the pseudo scaling solution provides a natural solution to the domain wall problem .",
    "here we emphasize that the pseudo scaling solution for @xmath253 is more powerful in solving the domain wall problem than the scaling solution for @xmath255 .",
    "to see this point , let us consider the following potential : @xmath256 where we assume @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "first consider the scaling solution @xmath255 . in this case , if the initial value of @xmath4 is large enough , the field @xmath4 obeys the scaling solution after inflation .",
    "if @xmath259 , the dynamics is dominated by the @xmath260 term and @xmath4 starts to oscillate around the origin when @xmath261 .",
    "thus , for sufficiently large @xmath262 , the domain wall problem occurs even if @xmath4 obeys the scaling solution at first .    on the other hand , in the case of the pseudo",
    "scaling solution @xmath253 , the dynamics becomes dominated by the @xmath260 term when @xmath263 where @xmath264 is defined as , and hence the dynamics is dominated by the @xmath260 term before the mass term becomes effective for @xmath265 . ]",
    "@xmath266 we can deduce this as follows . in terms of @xmath31 ,",
    "the effective potential is given by @xmath267 the amplitude of @xmath31 is of the order of @xmath33 , and hence the @xmath268 term becomes effective once the condition @xmath269 is satisfied .",
    "this condition is equivalent to eq .  .",
    "therefore , for example , if the @xmath260 term dominates the dynamics for the regime @xmath270 , the field value of @xmath4 at @xmath271 is given by @xmath272 if the initial amplitude satisfies @xmath273 , @xmath4 starts to oscillate with the amplitude much smaller than @xmath274 .",
    "thus , the domain wall problem is less likely to occur even in this case compared to the scaling solution .",
    "so far we have focused only on the domain wall problem , but similar implications can be obtained for other types of topological defects .",
    "we have shown that a scalar field with potential @xmath0 with @xmath15 exhibits a peculiar behavior which we call a pseudo scaling .",
    "it resembles neither oscillating nor scaling solution .",
    "we have also shown that the primordial curvature perturbation is generated by this pseudo - scaling curvaton .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath8 depends on the background expansion law : @xmath275 @xmath276 in the md ( rd ) universe .",
    "even a renormalizable term can lead to a pseudo - scaling dynamics , i.e. , @xmath277 is obtained for @xmath278 , where the hubble parameter is given by @xmath279 .",
    "this observation has implications on some realistic models and cosmological scenarios . in supersymmetric ( susy ) theories , for example , it is often the case that a scalar field has a non - renormalizable potential .",
    "an example is the affleck - dine ( ad ) field  @xcite which consists of the flat direction in the mssm and have the superpotential of the form  @xcite @xmath280 where @xmath4 denotes the ad field and the scalar potential is then given by @xmath281 where @xmath282 and @xmath283 represent the effect of susy breaking .",
    "if there is no hubble mass term or its coefficient is small , and the last term dominates the potential , the ad field may enter the pseudo - scaling regime .",
    "the @xmath284 flat direction , which is lifted up by the @xmath285 superpotential , matches the condition for the pseudo scaling if the background is matter - dominated as in the inflaton oscillation dominated era .",
    "in such a case , the lepton or baryon asymmetry generated by the ad mechanism will be significantly suppressed compared with the naive expectation , e.g. , the case of negative hubble mass term .",
    "another example is the susy axion model , in which the superpotential is given by  @xcite @xmath286 where @xmath4 and @xmath287 are the pq field having pq charge @xmath288 and @xmath289 respectively .",
    "the scalar potential is @xmath290 where we have taken @xmath291 for simplicity .",
    "if @xmath292 , @xmath4 can have a large vev which may be suitable as a solution to the strong cp problem  @xcite .    in the case where the pq symmetry is broken before inflation ,",
    "the axion field usually obtains a large fluctuation and may cause the isocurvature perturbation problem .",
    "one way to avoid the isocurvature problem is to consider the situation where the pq field takes a very large value during inflation  @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the isocurvature perturbation gets suppressed due to the large expectation value of the pq field . however , since the initial field value is large , particles are expected to be effectively produced due to the oscillation of the pq field after inflation . as a result , the pq symmetry may be non - thermally restored and hence the domain wall problem may occur after the qcd phase transition  @xcite . in this paper , we have seen that if the pq scalar obeys the pseudo scaling law after inflation , no such a disastrous situation is realized .",
    "thus , for example , if @xmath293 and the pq scalar starts to move during the inflaton oscillation dominated era ( with the mass term ) , the domain wall problem as well as the isocurvature perturbation problem can be naturally solved .",
