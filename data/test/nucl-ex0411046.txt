    "results obtained in the solar , atmospheric and reactor experiments are interpreted as the evidence of the neutrino oscillations and the existence of a small ( @xmath2  ev ) neutrino mass .",
    "but absolute values of neutrino masses and their hierarchy can not be determined solely from oscillation experiments .",
    "experimental searches for the neutrinoless double beta decay enable to check up the law of lepton charge conservation , to define the neutrino mass nature ( dirac or majorana ) and to investigate the absolute scale of neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "evidence of the observation of @xmath3ge @xmath4-decay  @xcite gave rise to a great discussion .",
    "thus appears the necessity to check this result and its interpretation with other isotopes and with higher sensitivity .",
    "a lot of new projects of the experiments with few tons isotopes are under consideration and development at present , for example genius  @xcite with @xmath3ge and exo  @xcite with @xmath0xe .",
    "the goal of the future experiments is to reach of the sensitivity @xmath5 years and to a neutrino mass of the order @xmath6  ev .",
    "however , for unequivocal definition on a neutrino mass ( or limit on mass ) the knowledge of a nuclear matrix element is necessary .",
    "there are many publications , devoted to theoretical calculations of the nuclear matrix elements both for @xmath7 and @xmath4 decay modes .",
    "results differ more than 2 times",
    ". therefore , experimental observations of @xmath7-decay for different isotopes with maximal accuracy are extremely important . possible test of the theoretical calculations has been proposed in  @xcite . where it was stated that final test of the theoretical calculations can be accomplished if @xmath4-decay of three ( or more ) isotopes will be observed .",
    "@xmath3ge @xmath7-decay was measured in the few experiments  @xcite , though some small disagreement exists .",
    "@xmath0xe @xmath7-decay is not observed up to now , so existing limits for half life time greatly differ , from @xmath8  y to @xmath9  y  @xcite .",
    "large track detector devis ( detector visualizing ) is the time projection chamber ( tpc ) in the magnetic field and it is operating at itep  @xcite .",
    "the first goal of the experiment is the investigation of @xmath0xe @xmath7-decay .",
    "schematic view of the setup one can see on the fig .",
    "[ pic_setup ] .",
    "tpc is placed at the magnet with diameter @xmath10 m. magnetic field can be changed in the range @xmath11 kilogauss with homogeneity not worse than 2% .",
    "source of @xmath12-decay is @xmath0xe , located in the central part of tpc , separated by thin mylar films ( 50  mkm ) out of two adjacent parts , filled by methane .",
    "detector is operating at atmospheric pressure .",
    "tpc detector has two drift sections , upper and lower ( high voltage drift electrodes are located on the upper and lower plates ) .",
    "uniformly distributed potential from 35  kv to 0  kv is fixed on the all - lateral surfaces ( including mylar films ) using special electrodes , creating the homogeneous electric drift field .",
    "ionization from passed charge particles in the gas is drifted in direction of an electric field to the proportional chambers , arranged in the center of tpc .",
    "three multiwire chambers ( for each gas volume ) have two rows of sensitive wires registering the events in the upper and lower drift sections .",
    "signals from two sensitive wires ( the upper and the lower ) are summarized on the input of preamplifier .",
    "detector has @xmath13 sensitive wires .",
    "additional readout from stripes ( cathode wire electrodes formed @xmath14 related to the sensitive wires ) is made for methane volumes  @xcite .",
    "the coordinate measurements are carried out with tdc ( time digital converter ) with number of the sensitive wire being coordinate along the magnetic field while the drift time being the coordinate along the electric field .",
    "the trajectory of the electron in magnetic field has a spiral form .",
    "therefore in the basic projection ( number of sensitive wire ",
    "drift time ) track looks like a sinusoid , and in the additional projection ( number of cathode strip  drift time ) like a cycloid .",
    "the momentum and motion direction are defined by fitting of the trajectory .",
    "block scheme of the trigger and recording electronics one can see on fig .  [ pic_el ] .",
    "signals from preamplifiers of sensitive wires and cathode strips [ a ] with 13  m cables go to discriminators [ d ] with threshold 30  mv ( 15  mv ) with standard nim ( @xmath15  v ) output .",
    "the discriminator can work in three modes : duration above threshold , formation of the duration , start and end of the signal from the wire or strip .",
    "we mainly used duration above the threshold mode . thus duration on an output of the discriminator corresponds to the duration of a signal exceeding the threshold .",
    "dead time of the device was equal to 60  ns .",
    "discriminators have two outputs .",
    "each wire and strip was connected to tdc using twisted pairs and the time of each hit from wires or strips was fixed .",
    "other outputs from discriminators of sensitive wires were used to form trigger .",
    "parameters of tdc ( full time of tdc circle  80  mks , one bin  20  ns ) were chosen to minimize the errors in spatial resolution due to electronics , compared to errors by multiple scattering and diffusion .",
    "since it is unknown when an event happens the setup worked in mode `` run '' .",
    "the clock generator was started by computer , and stopped by trigger .",
    "trigger started information recording from tdc to computer .",
    "the signal `` fast dump '' [ fd ] cleared the memory of all tdc if trigger did not occurred during 320  mks , 4 cycles of tdc .",
    "fd was blocked if it was coincided with trigger , so we had not losses due to fd .",
    "on the first stage we used 320 tdc blocks  @xcite .",
    "the basic part of trigger electronic consists of two trigger processors m@xmath16 and m@xmath17 connected to left and right volumes of tpc .",
    "the trigger signal from processor arises , when more than 20 sensitive wires from 32 wires on the inputs of m@xmath18 , coincide in the 6 mks gate .",
    "this time corresponds to the size of the sinusoid track and drift velocity in the ch@xmath19 volume .",
    "the signals from m@xmath16 and m@xmath17 coincide at the scheme [ cc1 ] . at the first stage we used as a trigger coincidences between 4 fixed wires ( 2 wires from both left and right ch@xmath19 volumes ) .",
    "use of the processors increased the trigger efficiency from large drift distance because the register efficiency of separate sensitive wires is equal to 8592% depended on drift pass .    a signal from another processor [ pac ] arising for events with many tracks in methane volumes included as anti - coincidence to the basic trigger [ cc3 ] .",
    "usage of this processor allowed skipping directly in the trigger a part of events with many tracks , thus we reduced the time of data read - out from tdc and increased an alive operating time of setup up to 85% .",
    "signals of counters of the active protection cck from charge cosmic radiation were also included in anti - coincidences to basic trigger [ cc2 ] .",
    "the description of active protection is resulted in part 5 .    at an initial stage we selected events with 2 electrons , directed in the different sides .",
    "the rate of triggers was 45/s .",
    "as tpc detector consists of three separate not pumped out volumes operating at atmospheric pressure filling with working gases and maintenance of necessary purity of gases appeared difficult enough .",
    "gas supply system consists of 3 separate cycles ( see fig .",
    "[ pic_gaz ] ) :    1 .   methane cycle  for two large side volumes , in sum about 10 m@xmath20 , 2 .",
    "xenon cycle  for central target volume of 2 m@xmath20 , 3 .",
    "subsystem for the proportional counters of active protection from cosmic radiation .",
    "two methane volumes were filled by gradual replacing of air with methane , at the first stage by pumping - out with submission of methane , then by flowing up of necessary quantity of volumes .",
    "filling of central target part with mixture xe+ch@xmath19 was essentially more difficult problem , because xe ( even with the natural composition of isotopes ) is a very expensive gas so flowing up becomes impossible .",
    "the technique with the chemical reaction described in  @xcite was used .",
    "first , the central volume was filled by co@xmath21 .",
    "then co@xmath21 gas was absorbed in special reactor with alkali ( naoh ) with a compensation of the pressure decrease by ( xe+ch@xmath19 ) mixture .",
    "it was necessary to use the admixture of methane to increase the drift velocity as such in pure xe at our drift field v@xmath22  kv / cm was too small .",
    "the gas composition was controlled in all volumes by chromatograph axt-002 - 01 ( russian ) with accuracy @xmath23  2% .    after filling the volumes",
    "the gas purification is provided in the closed cycles . to have high efficiency for large ( l @xmath24",
    "m ) drift distances deep purification of the working gases from electronegative impurities ( o@xmath21 and h@xmath21o vapor ) is necessary up to a level better than 10 ppm .",
    "reactors with ni / sio@xmath21 adsorbent used at the early stage posses fine purification properties , but should be used at high temperature @xmath25c . at such temperature the small part of methane dissociates and hydrogen appears in the detector volumes what could noticeably change the drift velocity .",
    "but the main lack of this adsorbent is that it contains the big admixture of @xmath26u and @xmath27th .",
    "so the isotopes @xmath28rn and @xmath29rn appear in the detector due to diffusion from a reactor . the decay of their daughter isotopes @xmath30bi and @xmath31tl could imitate the events of double beta decay .",
    "we investigated various getters from the point of view of their cleaning properties , capacity on o@xmath21 ( it was necessary to purify large volumes of the gas @xmath32  m@xmath20 ) and the diffusion of rn isotopes .",
    "a getter of the active metals alloy was developed specially for us at the institute of chemistry and technology of organic compound .",
    "two reactors for methane and xenon volumes operating at room temperature were prepared .",
    "using of new reactors allowed to reduce rn concentration more than in 50 times .",
    "calibrating measurements are described below in section 10 .",
    "gas electronegative impurities were controlled using amplitude measurements with the radioactive source @xmath33fe located in windows in lateral tpc wall on drift distances of 24 and 129 cm  @xcite , and by the trigger rate of setup during measurements .",
    "tpc is surrounded by the gas proportional counters of active protection from cosmic radiation on all sides .",
    "counters were made of aluminum pipe square cross - section @xmath34  @xmath35 with 50 mkm central wire .",
    "the length of counters varies from 1.5 up to 3.5 m. four in fold joins them in groups with one amplifier per fold .",
    "total active surface of 6 panels of counters is @xmath36  m@xmath37 .",
    "the counters are pumped and filled by ch@xmath19/ar mixture and works 3 months without purification , then gas changes .",
    "the counters efficiency checked with the aid of the radioactive source @xmath38cd was not worse than 92% .",
    "all 6 panels are included in the coincedence scheme cck ( see fig .",
    "[ pic_el ] ) .",
    "it gives out a veto signal veto on full time of drift in methane in case of signals from any two panels after cosmic particle passage through tpc .",
    "in addition , the separate segments of protection register @xmath39-mesons crossed xe - volume also giving a veto signal in the trigger and registering in tdc .",
    "such including gave the additional suppression of events concerned with cosmic particles .",
    "accidental coincidences are equal 4% and are controlled regularly .",
    "to know the drift velocity in methane volume is necessary to calculate the electron kinetic energy using a form of the trajectory .",
    "the knowledge of drift velocity in xe volume is necessary , because the time difference in ch@xmath19 and xe volumes defines the coordinate on drift distance and also for restoration of event vertex .",
    "measurements of the drift velocities and checks of its dependence on drift length are carried out using the cosmic trigger .",
    "we look for cosmic particles ( for example , coincidence of the counters pointed on fig .",
    "[ pic_setup ] ) crossing the volume of tpc .",
    "the delay time of each sensitive wire depends on drift distance at known cosmic trigger .",
    "the centers of the delay time distributions for all sensitive wires approximate with a straight line well .",
    "the inclination of a straight line gives drift velocity as the distances between wires are fixed .",
    "to test this measurement we also use the time distributions for the central wires in ch@xmath19 , because we know the drift distance at fixed trigger ( with not so good accuracy ) . the drift velocity in ch@xmath19 coincides for both cases and",
    "equals w@xmath40  cm / sec .",
    "it weakly depends on small admixture of nitrogen in volume ( accumulated from the atmosphere ) and was measured regularly during the runs .",
    "changes were not more than 10% .",
    "the drift velocity in xe is determined from time distribution for central wire in xe volume in case of the cosmic trigger and ranges within @xmath41  cm / sec with xe concentration .",
    "the difference in drift times in ch@xmath19 and xe volumes determines the absolute event coordinate along an electric drift field @xmath42 = ( t_{xe } - t_{ch_4})\\cdot(w_{ch_4}\\cdot{}w_{xe})/(w_{xe}-w_{ch_4})\\ ] ] and is fixed on tdc . at the correct work of the detector the times ( coordinates ) should be distributed uniformly .",
    "distribution of this difference between drift times in ch@xmath19 and xe volumes is resulted on fig .",
    "[ pic_dmexe ] .",
    "such distributions are checked few times in a day and allow watching the tpc condition .",
    "one can see that small efficiency fall takes place along the drift .",
    "a few measurement series were made using different xe concentration with the natural isotope composition for the optimal quantity of xe determination .",
    "tpc showed good stability with 50% concentration of xe and small ( 4% ) admixture of ic@xmath19h@xmath43 in order to cancel the `` excitation '' of xe wires . on",
    "the other hand monte - carlo simulations of the tpc efficiency for @xmath12-decay showed the weak dependence on xe concentration .",
    "so our measurements were made with the following gas composition : xe  ( 50% ) , ch@xmath19  ( 46% ) , ic@xmath19h@xmath43  ( 4% ) .",
    "such concentration corresponds to 5 kg of xe in central part tpc .",
    "drift velocity in the central volume decreased up to @xmath44  cm / mks .",
    "so to determine the coordinate along the drift pass ( measuring of the drift time difference in ch@xmath19 and xe volumes ) special block tdc with total time of 160 mks was used .    during 1000 hours of the exposition",
    "broken into two intervals of 515 and 485 hours because of failure with a high - voltage cable ( 10  kv supply of transformers for the sources of the stabilized current for a magnet ) about @xmath45 triggers were recorded .",
    "additional expositions with a radioactive source @xmath46bi for determination of the energy resolution and checking of the efficiency on - line programs were also made .",
    "in other runs with enlarged rn isotopes concentration in the central volume of the detector ( reactors ni / sio@xmath21 used ) we checked up the quality of the new reactors and correctness of work both off - line and modeling programs ( see section 10 ) simultaneously .",
    "reduction of the rn concentration by a factor of 50 due to use of reactors on the basis of an alloy of metals resulted in the number of double events reducing only @xmath47 times . at this level",
    "it became clear that an additional source of events with two electrons was the cosmic particles crossing the dead zones in xe volume .",
    "active protection from charged cosmic was reinforced with few new fold cosmic counters .",
    "it decreased quantity of double events by @xmath48 times .",
    "the large statistics of events from lateral covers without a direction selection has been recorded for the determination of the efficiency of separate sensitive wires in ch@xmath19 and xe volumes depended on drift distances .",

    "events with electrons escaped from xe in the two different sides in the right and left volumes filled with ch@xmath19 are selected .",
    "such selection twice reduces efficiency of the detector to @xmath12-decay , but considerably simplifies procedure of events distinguishing as it is not required to disentangle electron tracks escaped in one side .",
    "projection of a track in number of a sensitive wire and drift time coordinates is sinusoid , while in number cathodic strip and drift time coordinates is cycloid as cathodic strips are located under @xmath14 angle to sensitive wires .",
    "the loop or narrow part of cycloid is directed in specific direction related to drift depended on a motion direction of the electron .",
    "so one can select the electrons escaped from xe volume or from lateral covers .",
    "events candidates in double - beta decay had two electrons from xe volumes",
    ".    the on - line program uses two simple algorithms for events distinguishing .",

    "if the number of strip hits above @xmath52 exceeds number of strip hits below @xmath52 it is considered that the narrow part of cycloid ( loop ) is directed downwards to drift that corresponds to one electron direction and in the other case to the opposite direction .",
    "such simple algorithms have reduced the detector rate from 45 event / s after the electronic trigger up to 2.2 event / s .",
    "the factor of background suppression at this stage is equal to 20 .",

    "further this rate has been additionally reduced by @xmath55% by removal of the events with an additional track in methane volume ( 3-rd track ) , by more careful fitting and by removal of events with large energy cosmic particles ( straight tracks ) .",
    "residuary events passes full fit in both number of a sensitive wire and drift time coordinates and in number of cathode strip and drift time additional coordinates .",
    "it should be noted that fitting programs used only tracks in methane volumes . in the basic coordinates a projection of electrons tracks in each methane volume is fitted by function @xmath56 with four parameters , where x is coordinate along which number of a sensitive wire varies and z is coordinate along drift . in this case",
    "@xmath57 is the angle between a momentum of the electron and a magnetic field , @xmath58 is larmor radius , a is the mean line of a sinusoid and @xmath59 is a phase of a sinusoid . it is supposed that the momentum and corresponding larmor radius of electron in methane volume changes weakly .",
    "losses in 60  cm of ch@xmath19 gas make tens kev , and momentum of electron from the double beta decay is in a range from 100  kev up to 2  mev . to take into account multiple scattering in methane two breaks on a trajectory are supposed during the fitting with larmor radius being the same but angles @xmath57 and @xmath59 changed .",
    "this is especially essential for low energies when scattering grows . with one break",

    "projections of a trajectories of the each electron in number of a sensitive wire and drift time coordinates ( and number of a cathode strip and drift time coordinates ) are fitted separately . spatial precision along drift at sensitive wires and cathodic strips differs .",
    "the signal amplitude from a cathodic strip is 6 times less than that from a sensitive wire and on one cathode strip there can be added signals from several wires , this leaded to shift of the time .    as a result of work of the fitting program the quantity of events",

    "the fitting program usually made mistakes due to presence of the additional hits ( sparks ) in wires and in strips , and due to the distortion of the tracks as a result of scattering and distortion of the electric drift field near the mylar films .",
    "strengthening of selection criteria led to the further loss of efficiency .",
    "events with additional tracks in any of methane volumes both in top and bottom were thrown out .",
    "events of ( 1 + 2 ) types were  @xmath23  36/h .",
    "events with two or more tracks in xe - volume and events when the track in xe was absent (  @xmath23  1/h ) were thrown out also .",
    "events with a seen track of a cosmic particle in any of volumes were thrown out (  @xmath23  3/h ) .",
    "double viewing of the whole material was made .",
    "the efficiency of viewing was close to 100% .",
    "after visual viewing there were 954 events .",
    "in addition 45 events have been removed from the two - electron events sample with small quantity of the worked wires .",
    "events with actuated wires in xe volume n@xmath92 out of total 17 sensitive wires were thrown out . in ch@xmath19 volumes actuation of n@xmath93 wires out of 30",
    "nearest to xe was required .",
    "efficiency has not decreased practically , but events with severely different number of actuated wires in l and r volumes have been removed , that most likely was connected to accidental coincidence in drift of the left and right tracks .    909 events recorded during 1000 hours remained for the analysis .",
    "-events , title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "distribution along the drift of remaining 909 @xmath12-events showed substantial growth of the number of the events from small drift distances .",
    "this distribution differed from the same distributions after on - line ( see fig .",
    "[ pic_dmexe ] ) and off - line processions",
    ". similar concentration of events was observed for the events concerned with @xmath30bi decay ( see fig .",
    "[ pic_dmexe2 ] ) .",
    "we assume that these events can be concerned with an interaction of the cosmic particles in multiwire detectors frames and also with possible concentration growth of ions @xmath30bi near the detector as a result of diffusion rn from a frame s material .",
    "events from small drift distances with the corresponding corrections of efficiency have been thrown out .",
    "number of @xmath12-candidate events was reduced more than twice while efficiency decreased only by 10% .",
    "energy spectrum of the single electron for @xmath12-candidate events was more rigid than spectrum of monte - carlo events passed full processing .",
    "therefore , energy restrictions were chosen according to monte carlo distributions .    on fig .",
    "[ pic_e_mc ] distributions of energy for each electron and total energy of two electrons for @xmath4 and @xmath4 monte - carlo events are presented .",
    "energy cuts for each electron @xmath94  mev for @xmath7 decay ( see fig .",
    "[ pic_e_mc ] ) were introduced with small efficiency loss .",
    "assuming the same statistics to be obtained during an exposition with @xmath0xe and all 254 remaining events to be background we estimate sensitivity of the detector in 1000 measurement hours as @xmath95  years .    to estimate sensitivity for @xmath4 decay energy cuts @xmath96  mev for every electron energy and for the sum energy @xmath97  mev were used .",
    "such wide interval for the sum energy was used because the electron energy was measured in the methane volumes and losses in xe were not taken into account .",
    "further measurement of ionization losses in xe volume and corresponding narrowing of an interval for the two - electron sum energy is planned . with such cuts",
    "there were 152 events , that led to limit estimation @xmath98  years for 1000 measurement hours .",
    "in the near future the exposition of tpc detector with @xmath0xe will be started .",
    "sensitivity of setup can be increased using both the top and bottom drift sections .",
    "the results discussed were obtained with half of detector ( only the top drift section ) .",
    "measurement ionization losses will give additional criteria in suppression of background events .",
    "including the second half of detector , measurement of ionization losses in xe and increase of measurements time will allow to improve results .",
    "authors are grateful to m.v.danilov for constant interest , support and discussion of results and possible ways of their improvement .",
