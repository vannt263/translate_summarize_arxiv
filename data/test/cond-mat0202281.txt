    "it is well known that bismuth - substituted ferrite garnets ( bi : fgs ) have a giant magnetooptical response@xcite .",
    "for this reason , they have found widespread use as optical switchers , optical isolators and magnetic field sensors .",
    "some years ago it was realized that bi : fg films with in - plane magnetization allow effective visualization and detection of magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "this discovery triggered a large number of quantitative studies of magnetic fields from superconductors , domain formation in magnetic materials , currents in microelectronic circuits and recorded patterns in magnetic storage media@xcite .",
    "however , no systematic studies have been carried out to characterise the magnetooptic properties of these films . of particular interest here",
    "is the faraday rotation , since this parameter determines the usefulness of the indicator .",
    "bi : fg films grown on ( 100 ) oriented substrates have been shown to have a number of unique properties which make them excellent candidates for magnetooptic imaging .",
    "first , these films exihibit very little domain activity , and respond to an increasing external field by a continous rotation of the magnetization vector .",
    "second , the sensitivity of the films is easily tuned by altering the chemical composition .",
    "the sensitivity of the faraday rotation to an external field is of major importance in magnetooptic imaging and detection , in particular when the external field is weak .",
    "to date several studies have been done to determine the sensitivity of bulk - samples and ( 111 ) oriented bi : fg films@xcite .",
    "however , no studies have been carried out to characterise and understand the sensitivity of ( 100 ) orientated films .    in a previous paper we presented an experimental and theoretical study of the faraday rotation at saturation@xcite . in that study",
    "a very simple model based on two electric dipole transitions , one tetrahedral and one octahedral , was used to explain the experimental data . here",
    "we extend the work in that paper , and also introduce several new features .",
    "we have grown a series of gallium - substituted bi : fg films using the liquid phase epitaxy ( lpe ) technique , and characterised their chemical composition .",
    "the faraday rotation spectra have been measured for photon energies between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ev , corresponding to wavelengths between @xmath2 and @xmath3 nm .",
    "it is shown that the faraday rotation changes significantly with the amount of substituted gallium and bismuth .",
    "furthermore , the comparison of experimental and theoretical data confirms that the magnetooptic response increases linearly with the bismuth substitution and decreases almost linearly with the gallium substitution .",
    "we also report experimental data for the sensitivity of these materials , and find that the sensitivity depends nonlinearly on the gallium substitution , in good agreement with the theoretical model .",
    "single crystal films of bi : fg were grown by isothermal lpe from @xmath4 flux onto ( 100 ) oriented gadolinium gallium garnet ( ggg ) substrates .",
    "the growth takes place while the substrate is dipped into the melt contained in a pt crucible . during the growth",
    ", the parameters could be controlled to create low magnetic coercivity and in - plane magnetization in the garnet films .",
    "the thickness of the films was measured using a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) and confirmed with optical techniques , while their composition were determined with an electron microprobe ( emp ) .",
    "thicknesses and compositions of the selected samples are listed in table 1 .    from table",
    "i one sees that the films can be represented by the following general formula : @xmath5(fe_{3-z_{d}}ga_{z_{d}})o_{12}$ ] , where @xmath6 indicates the dodecahedral site , [ ] the octahedral site , and ( ) the tetrahedral site .",
    "note that only the total gallium content @xmath7 can be extracted from the emp , and to determine @xmath8 and @xmath9 separately other techniques such as neutron spectroscopy must be applied .",
    "the distribution of gallium on tetrahedral and octahedral sites have been examined in a number of studies on garnets with and without bismuth@xcite .",
    "these results indicate that around @xmath10 of the gallium occupies the tetrahedral site .",
    "this fact will be used later in this paper .",
    "the films also contain small amounts of @xmath11 , typically of the order of @xmath12 , but this will neglected here , since it does not influence the faraday rotation significantly .",
    "we have measured the faraday spectra ( at room temperature ) of the films presented in table i. shown in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] is the observed faraday rotation as a function of wavelength for samples 7 and 8 , respectively .",
    "note that both films have maximum rotation near 2.45 ev , a feature characteristic of all the films considered in this study .",
    "in fact , all the films exhibit the same spectral shape , with only minor deviations from that seen in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] .    in order to understand the behaviour of the spectra",
    ", we have adopted the theory developed in refs.@xcite . here the expression for the faraday rotation is given by @xmath13^{2 } + 4\\omega^{2}\\gamma_{i}^{2 } } - \\frac{(\\omega_{i}-\\delta_{i})^{2}-\\omega^{2}-\\gamma_{i}^{2}}{\\left[(\\omega_{i}-\\delta_{i})^{2}-\\omega^{2}+\\gamma_{i}^{2}\\right]^{2 } + 4\\omega^{2}\\gamma_{i}^{2 } } \\right\\ } \\,\\,\\ ,   , \\label{far } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 represent the resonance energy , @xmath15 the oscillator strength , while @xmath16 is the half - linewidth of the transition .",
    "furthermore , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the electron charge and mass , respectively , whereas @xmath19 is the active ion density .    for @xmath20",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath19 is directly proportional to the bismuth content @xmath21@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the strong enhancement of faraday rotation is caused by iron - pair transitions , involving both octahedral and tetrahedral transitions simultaneously@xcite .",
    "therefore , iron dilution of either sublattice results in a reduction of the active ion density . for these reasons",
    "we assume that the active ion density can be written as@xcite @xmath22 @xmath23 is a constant , and may expected to be 1/3 of the density of rare - earth ions on the dodecahedral site , i.e. @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "when @xmath26 , this interpretation implies that the dodecahedral site is fully occupied by bismuth .    to fit theoretical curves to the experimental data , the product @xmath27 was chosen as free parameter",
    "the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 were chosen as sample independent , and the values suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite were used as a starting point in the fitting .",
    "table ii presents the paremeters found to give the best fit between the theoretical curves and experimental data .",
    "note that our values for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 differs slightly from those used in ref .",
    "this is due to the fact that in that paper we focused on obtaining a very good fit for energies less than 2.3 ev .",
    "however , this resulted in some deviations between experiment and theory near the maximum faraday rotation . here",
    "we have chosen parameters which give the best agreement within the whole range of experimental data .",
    "the solid line shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] is the faraday rotation calculated from eq .",
    "( [ far ] ) using the values in table ii .",
    "the dashed and dash - dotted lines show the contribution to the total faraday rotation from the octahedral and tetrahedral sites , respectively .",
    "note that below 2.2 ev , the main contribution to @xmath31 comes from the octahedral site .    the solid line in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] shows the calculated faraday rotation of sample 8 .",
    "again , we note that the theoretical curve is in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "also shown is the theoretical predictions when the bismuth content is x=1.5 ( dashed line ) . in this case",
    "one may expect almost 7 @xmath32 at 2.3 ev .",
    "it is useful to find out how bismuth and gallium influences the faraday rotation . to this end",
    ", we define the following parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the faraday rotations associated with the bismuth and gallium content , respectively . the experimental data and theoretical curves for these two parameters are plotted in figs .",
    "[ f3 ] and [ f4 ] , respectively .",
    "the good agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions confirm the validity of the model used here .",
    "if a light beam propagates along the z - axis through the magnetic film , then the polar faraday rotation of the film is given by ( neglecting the voigt - effect and multiple reflections)@xcite @xmath37 where the anisotropy field is defined by @xmath38 eq . ( [ f ] ) is only valid as long as the cubic anisotropy can be neglected . when @xmath39 , the faraday rotation is at its maximum value . as an example , the faraday rotation as a function of @xmath40 for sample 4 is shown in fig .",
    "note that the faraday rotation is accurately described by eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) as long as @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] the experimental values for @xmath42 is displayed as a function of gallium substitition .",
    "the dashed line shows the best fit to @xmath42 for films with composition @xmath43 @xmath44 also shown is the value for @xmath45 found in the litterature@xcite @xmath46 the experimental values for @xmath42 are quite close to eq .",
    "( [ ms ] ) , which indicates that the uniaxial anisotropy plays a minor role here . since the films of composition @xmath43 are well described by eq .",
    "( [ ha ] ) , we will use this in the further modelling .",
    "film 7 , 8 and 12 are not well described by eq .",
    "( [ ha ] ) , which is most probably due to their chemical composition .",
    "the faraday rotation sensitivity is given by @xmath47 it is useful to separate the contributions from bismuth and gallium .",
    "the contribution from bismuth can be written as @xmath48 the experimental data at 2.3 ev ( wavelength 540 nm ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] together with the theoretical prediction based on eq .",
    "( [ bi ] ) .",
    "a reasonably good agreement is obtained for all samples of composition @xmath43 , except sample 11 , which shows a minor deviation from the theoretical curve .",
    "we do not know the reason for this deviation .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the sensitivity depends linearly on the bismuth content .",
    "the experimental data for samples 7 , 8 and 12 ( diamond , circle and cross ) are located far from the straight line , since they do not follow eq .",
    "( [ ha ] ) .",
    "it is also of interest to see how gallium influences the sensitivity of the material .",
    "to that end , we define @xmath49 in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] the experimental data are shown together with the theoretical prediction based on eq .",
    "( [ ga ] ) .",
    "again we note that there is good agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical curve for samples of composition @xmath43 ( except for sample 11 , which shows a minor deviation from the theoretical curve ) .",
    "now the sensitivity has a strong nonlinear dependence on the gallium content .",
    "thus , one may think that it should be possible to increase the sensitivity even further by adding more gallium .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "if we add more gallium ( above z=1.2 ) , the film approaches its compensation point ( @xmath50 ) where the coercivity of the material is rather high . on the other hand",
    ", it would be of interest to investigate the sensitivity above the compensation point , which is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we have investigated the faraday rotation of in - plane magnetized bismuth - substituted ferrite garnet films grown by liquid phase epitaxy on ( 100 ) oriented gadolinium gallium garnet substrates .",
    "the faraday spectra were measured for photon energies between 1.7 - 2.6 ev . to interprete the spectra",
    ", we use a simple model based on two electric dipole transitions , and find excellent agreement with the experimental data .",
    "furthermore , the faraday rotation sensitivity was measured at 2.3 ev , and found to be in good agreement with the theoretical predicitions .",
    "in particular , we find that the sensitivity increases linearly with the bismuth content and nonlinearly with the gallium content ."
