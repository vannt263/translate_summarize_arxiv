    "in this short introduction we would like to introduce the two players in the title , random matrix theory ( rmt ) and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , on a superficial level .",
    "this gives a motivation why and where it will be beneficial to relate these two seemingly unrelated theories , and what the reader may expect to learn from these notes .",
    "let us begin with qcd , the theory of the strong interactions .",
    "it is part of the standard model of elementary particles that also describes the weak and electromagnetic interactions among all elementary particles .",
    "the latter two interactions will however not play any role here .",
    "the particle content of qcd are the @xmath0 quarks with masses @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the gluons . in nature @xmath3 flavours have been observed named up , down , strange , charm , top and bottom quark . in the following",
    "we will keep @xmath0 as a free parameter , and often consider only the lightest up and down quark ( @xmath4 ) as they constitute the most common particles as proton ( p ) , neutron ( n ) and pions ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the quarks interact through the gluons , the carriers of force , with a coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "both come in 3 colours and the interaction is described through a field strength and covariant derivative carrying an @xmath7 lie group structure .",
    "qcd is a strongly interacting , relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) which is very difficult .",
    "fortunately we will only need to know a few features and some of its global symmetries that will be described in section [ symm ] .",
    "for a standard textbook on perturbative qcd we refer for example to @xcite .    roughly speaking qcd has two different phases that are schematically depicted in figure [ fig : phasediag ] .",
    "they are characterised by an order parameter , the chiral condensate @xmath8 . at high energies corresponding to high temperatures t ,",
    "@xmath9 and quarks and gluons form a plasma , that has been observed in collision experiments e.g. at the relativistic heavy ion collider rhic in brookhaven .",
    "this phase also existed in the early universe , with the cooling down happening close to the temperature axis at low baryon density parametrised by @xmath10 . in these situations as well as in single particle collisions produced at collider experiments a perturbative expansion in powers of the coupling @xmath6 typically applies , as described e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the second phase with @xmath11 at low temperature and density is the one in which we live . here",
    "quarks condense into colourless objects , that is into baryons made of 3 quarks of different colour adding up to white ( like p or n ) , or mesons made of a quark and an anti - quark with its anti - colour ( like the @xmath12 s ) .",
    "gluons are also confined to these objects , and a proof of confinement of quarks and gluons from qcd is still considered to be an open millennium problem . in qcd",
    "it happens that confinement goes along with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry - hence the name of @xmath8 .",
    "this global symmetry will be described in detail later , and eventually lead us to a rmt description .",
    "( 12.2,5.5 ) ( 1.0,0.3)(1,0)8 ( 9.2,0.2)@xmath10 ( 1.0,0.3)(0,1)5 ( 0.1,5.1)@xmath13 ( 0.1,4.3)@xmath14 ( 7.1,4.0)@xmath9 ( 1.0,-0.1)@xmath15 ( 2.9,1.8)@xmath11 ( 3.9,4.25)@xmath16 ( 8.0,-0.1)@xmath17 ( 1.0,4.4)(4.7,4.3)(4.0,4.3 ) ( 4.0,4.3)(7.0,4.2)(8.0,0.3 )    in the phase with @xmath11 perturbation theory breaks down and one has to apply other methods .",
    "if one wants to continue to work with first principles and the qcd action , one possibility is to study qcd on a finite space - time lattice of volume @xmath18 and lattice spacing @xmath19 , equipped with a euclidean metric .",
    "the numerical solution of this theory nowadays reproduces the masses of particles that are composed of elementary ones to a very high precision , as testified in the particle data booklet @xcite . to that aim",
    "two limits have to be made , the continuum limit sending @xmath20 and the thermodynamical limit sending @xmath21 . for a standard textbook on lattice",
    "qcd we refer to @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is to approximate qcd in the confined phase by effective theories , that describe for example only the low energy excitation .",
    "one of these is chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , see @xcite for a review , that describes the low momentum modes that appear after the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , the so - called goldstone bosons .",
    "another such theory is rmt .",
    "it should be clear by now that rmt will not solve qcd ( nor chpt ) , in the continuum or on the lattice .",
    "however , it will describe certain aspects in an analytic fashion , namely the spectral properties of the small eigenvalues of the qcd dirac operator @xmath22 . in a finite volume",
    "the density of eigenvalues of @xmath22 satisfies the banks - casher relation @xcite @xmath23 which relates it to the described setup",
    ". in particular rmt will predict the detailed dependence on the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath10 , @xmath19 , and @xmath18 after being appropriately rescaled , as well as on a the zero - eigenvalues of @xmath22 which relate to a topological index @xmath24 .",
    "and most remarkably these predictions have been verified in comparison to lattice qcd by many groups .",
    "we will not repeat these findings here and refer to the literature at the end of each section .",
    "the idea to apply rmt to qcd goes back to the seminal works @xcite that started from the simplest case with @xmath25 which is called quenched approximation , at @xmath26 .",
    "the field has since developed enormously , leading to the detailed analytical knowledge that we will describe .",
    "there exist a number of excellent reviews already , @xcite , notably the lecture notes from the les houches session in 2004 by j. verbaarschot @xcite .",
    "this brings me to the main goals of these lecture notes , to be addressed in the order of the subsequent sections .",
    "what can we predict from rmt that can be compared to lattice qcd ?",
    "in section [ opdirac ] we will start with the solution of the corresponding rmt using the theory of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "this section is rather mathematical and contains no further physics input .",
    "the second question , what the limit is , in which qcd reduces to rmt , is addressed in section [ symm ] . here",
    "the global symmetries of qcd are explained , leading to chpt and eventually to a rmt description .",
    "the more physics inclined reader may jump to this section first .",
    "one of my personal motivations why to add another review on this topic is answered in section [ recent ] where the development in the last 10 years is reviewed , including some mathematical aspects .",
    "this covers the dependence on finite lattice spacing @xmath19 and on chemical potential @xmath10 , for an earlier review on the latter see @xcite .",
    "let us move to rmt , where i assume that the reader has already some working knowledge .",
    "rmt is a much older topic , beginning in the late 1920 s with wishart in mathematical statistics and in the late 1950 s with wigner and dyson in nuclear physics .",
    "the number of its applications is huge and still increasing , and we refer to @xcite for applications to quantum physics and to @xcite for a recent compilation containing physics ( including qcd in chapter 32 ) , mathematics and more . in these lecture notes",
    "we will focus only on the theory of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "for the standard gaussian ensembles they are covered in the last edition of mehta s classical book @xcite , for more recent monographs see @xcite .",
    "the symmetry class we will be interested in for the application to qcd is the chiral gaussian unitary ensemble ( chgue ) , which is also known as wishart or laguerre unitary ensemble , and extensions thereof . in the simplest case of @xmath25 and",
    "when all the abovementioned parameters from qcd are absent it is defined by the probability space of complex @xmath27 matrices @xmath28 .",
    "all its matrix elements are independent and share the same complex normal distribution .",
    "the mean density @xmath29 of the positive eigenvalues of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the hermitian conjugate , is well known in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "after an appropriate rescaling it is given by the marchenko - pastur law depicted in figure [ fig : mpdensity ] , cf . the lectures by bouchaud where this was derived .",
    "( 12.2,4.5 )   which is the limiting global spectral density of the chgue .",
    "we also indicate the locations where different local statistics applies : they are given by i ) the bessel - kernel close to the hard edge , ii ) the sine - kernel in the bulk and iii ) the airy - kernel at the soft edge .",
    "[ fig : mpdensity],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] ( 0.2,-0.2)@xmath33 ( -7.8,4.0)@xmath29 ( -1.9,-0.2)iii ) ( -6.6,-0.2)i ) ( -4.5,-0.2)ii )    the same law is obtained when taking real or quaternion valued matrix elements , constituting the chiral gaussian orthogonal and symplectic ensemble ( chgoe and chgse ) , respectively .",
    "however , the local statistics of the 3 ensembles differs , and depends on the location in the spectrum we consider .",
    "for finite @xmath34 the eigenvalue statistics follows a determinantal ( chgue ) or pfaffian point process ( chgoe , chgse ) , and the limiting kernels in the various locations of the spectrum shown in figure [ fig : mpdensity ] are given in terms of bessel , sine or airy functions .",
    "in view of the relation ( [ bcrel ] ) we will be interested in the local statistics for the chgue at the origin also called hard edge .",
    "the other two symmetry classes at the hard edge will also find applications in qft as pointed out in @xcite , cf .",
    "@xcite , but will not be discussed here . in the limit where rmt applies the eigenvalues @xmath35 of the qcd dirac operator @xmath22",
    "will be given by @xmath36 and thus come in pairs , where @xmath37 are the eigenvalues of @xmath30 ( the positive part @xmath38 are the singular values of @xmath28 ) .",
    "after this change of variables the marchenko - pastur law becomes a semi - circle , which is why the global density of @xmath22 at the origin will become constant ( and not divergent as in figure [ fig : mpdensity ] ) . for finite @xmath34",
    "the chgue can be solved in terms of the classical laguerre polynomials",
    ". it will be the content of sections [ opdirac ] and [ recent ] to include more structure from qcd into this rmt , while maintaining its exact solvability .",
    "in this section we go directly to the rmt of qcd in an eigenvalue representation that generalises the chgue , by including the mass terms of @xmath0 quark flavours . in subsection [ defs ]",
    "we briefly recall the orthogonal polynomial ( op ) formalism and define the quantities of our interest .",
    "we then attack the mathematical problem of computing these by deriving properties of op with a general weight , in particular including averages of characteristic polynomials in subsection [ genweight ] .",
    "this allows us to determine all quantities explicitly in terms of standard laguerre polynomials in subsection [ alllaguerre ] , which facilitates the large-@xmath34 limit to be taken in subsection [ lim ] .",

    "we have included the dependence on the following parameters to be related to qcd later : @xmath41 called the topological index taking fixed values , the masses @xmath42 , @xmath43 , with @xmath0 counting the number of inserted characteristic polynomials .",
    "in the quenched theory with @xmath25 their product is absent .",

    "we use einstein s summation conventions meaning that greek indices appearing twice are automatically summed over from 1 to 4 .",

    "however , as we will explain in the next subsection the precise form of the limit from qcd to rmt was better understood later , representing a controlled approximation .    furthermore , in the case when all masses vanish @xmath318 the action in the exponent in the first line of eq .",

    "this leads to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking pattern in qcd : @xmath332      in this subsection we will describe the first step of simplifying qcd to what is called its low - energy effective theory .",
    "we begin with the following observation .",
    "it is found that the qcd vacuum @xmath333 , the ground state with the lowest energy , breaks chiral symmetry _",
