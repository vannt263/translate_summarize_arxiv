    "in - medium hadronization can serve as a way to study the jet space - time development if the medium properties are well known , like in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering @xcite , or as a probe for the medium properties , like jet quenching effect observed in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on a rare type of jets in which the main fraction @xmath3 of the jet momentum is carried by a single ( leading ) hadron .",
    "the weight of such jets is strongly enhanced by selection of events with inclusive production of high-@xmath0 hadrons , due to the convolution with the steeply falling transverse - momentum distribution of the partons initiating the jet .",
    "the peculiar feature of such jets is the extremely high initial virtuality , which is of the order of the jet energy .",
    "this leads to an intensive gluon radiation and energy dissipation at the early stage of hadronization . in order to respect energy conservation in the production of a high-@xmath3 hadron ,",
    "the radiative dissipation of energy must stop by the production of a colorless hadronic state ( a qcd dipole usually called pre - hadron ) on a short distance from the jet origin @xcite .",
    "this distance , called production length @xmath4 , was evaluated in a model of perturbative hadronization , including energy conservation and sudakov suppression , and found rather short @xcite and nearly independent of jet energy .",
    "although the lorentz factor makes @xmath4 longer at higher @xmath0 , the rate of vacuum energy loss increases as well trying to shorten @xmath4 .",
    "short length scale @xmath4 implies that a created colorless dipole has to survive through the medium in order to be detected ( any inelastic interaction in the medium results in continuation of energy loss conflicting with energy conservation ) .",
    "the evolution of the dipole in the medium and its attenuation was calculated in @xcite using path integral technique @xcite .",
    "here the key phenomenon controlling attenuation of the dipole , is color transparency , which corresponds to the increased transparency of the medium for small - size dipoles @xcite .",
    "we employ the relation between the dipole cross section and transport coefficient ( broadening rate ) found in @xcite",
    ". then the observed magnitude of hadron attenuation can be used as a probe for the transport coefficient , which characterizes the medium density . adjusting only a single parameter , the transport coefficient",
    ", we can describe well data for inclusive production of large-@xmath0 hadrons in heavy ion collisions with different centralities at lhc and rhic @xcite ( see also the left panel of figs .",
    "[ lhc ] and [ rhic ] ) .    as a complementary test of the pqcd mechanism we also calculated the azimuthal anisotropy of produced hadrons in good agreement with the measured asymmetry parameter @xmath5 , with no further adjustments @xcite",
    "( see the right panel of figs .",
    "[ lhc ] and [ rhic ] ) .    within the pqcd mechanism we also included an additional effect related to the initial state interactions of the colliding nuclei .",
    "excitation of higher fock components in the colliding nucleons by multiple interactions leads to the energy - sharing conflict between different partons upon approaching to the kinematic limit of either large feynman @xmath6 , or / and transverse @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this effect can be seen in the @xmath0 dependence of the suppression factor @xmath1 at the rhic energies @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "even the lhc data at @xmath10 indicate that @xmath1 is leveling off at the high end of the measured @xmath0 interval .",
    "moreover , we expect a fall of @xmath1 at higher @xmath11 @xcite ( see the left panel of figs .  [ lhc ] and [ rhic ] ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that our approach , based on perturbative qcd , is irrelevant to data at @xmath12 apparently dominated by the statistical mechanisms . here",
    "the observed @xmath13 and @xmath5 expose quite a different behavior towards smaller @xmath0 , steeply rising and shaping a bump ( see figs .",
    "[ lhc ] and [ rhic ] ) .",
    "we attribute this behavior to the contribution of the hydrodynamic mechanism responsible for the evaporation of hadrons from the created hot medium . in this paper",
    "we combine the hydrodynamic mechanism from @xcite with the pqcd calculations attempting at a description of data on @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the full measured range of @xmath0 at different energies and centralities @xcite .",
    "combination of hydrodynamic @xcite and pqcd @xcite calculations for the suppression factor @xmath1 represented by the solid lines is compared with alice @xcite and cms @xcite data at different centralities in the left panel of fig .",
    "our results are in a good accord with in the full range of @xmath0 .",
    "the dashed and dotted curves represent calculations performed either within only pqcd or hydrodynamic mechanism , respectively .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ lhc ] shows the corresponding calculations for azimuthal anisotropy , @xmath2 , demonstrating again a successful description of alice @xcite and cms @xcite data in the full range of @xmath0 at different centralities .",
    "[ rhic ] presents the results of calculations based on combination of hydrodynamic and pqcd mechanisms in the full measured range of @xmath0 vs phenix data for the suppression factor @xmath14 @xcite ( the left panel ) and for the azimuthal anisotropy @xcite ( the right panel ) at different centralities .",
    "it worth emphasizing that calculations for different observables employ the same value of the transport coefficient @xmath15 , which however , varies with collision energy .",
    "we found @xmath16 and @xmath17 at the energies @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "important is also that the hydrodynamic calculations were done with the same value of @xmath15 .",
    "in this paper we developed a quantitative understanding of experimentally observed strong attenuation of hadrons inclusively produced with large @xmath0 in heavy ion collisions .",
    "for the first time we describe data for the suppression factor @xmath1 and azimuthal anisotropy @xmath5 in the full measured range of @xmath0 at different energies and centralities .",
    "the peculiar behavior of these observables is explained @xcite by the interplay of two mechanisms : ( i ) evaporation of hadrons from the created hot medium controlled by hydrodynamics @xcite ; ( ii ) perturbative qcd mechanism @xcite for high-@xmath0 hadron production based on a non - energy - loss scenario .",
    "the observed suppression is attributed to the survival probability of the colorless dipoles , which are produced on a short length scale and propagate through the dense medium .",
    "the abrupt transition between the two mechanisms causes distinct minima in @xmath13 and in @xmath5 at the same values of @xmath0 , while the hydrodynamic mechanism alone would lead to a monotonically rising @xmath5 . the detailed calculation and results",
    "will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
