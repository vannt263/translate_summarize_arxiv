    "inflation @xcite postulates that the very early universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion .",
    "it is typically described via the dynamics of the inflaton , a scalar effective degree of freedom coupled to gravity .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the inflaton and other light fields constitute the most widely studied mechanism for producing primordial density perturbations ( for reviews see refs .",
    "these perturbations induce temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and , as a consequence of their gravitational growth , lead to the formation of the large scale structure of the universe ( lss ) .",
    "a key corollary of the inflationary hypothesis is that precise measurements of the cmb and the distribution of galaxies in the sky constrain the physical mechanism that drives the accelerated expansion , opening a remarkable window into the physics of the very early universe . in recent years",
    ", high - quality observations of the cmb have been provided by the wmap satellite  @xcite , acbar  @xcite , the south pole telescope ( spt )  @xcite and the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite , while the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite has probed the density perturbations at low redshifts .",
    "further , data from the planck satellite @xcite will soon be available to the cosmological community , and several major lss surveys are now underway or are being planned .",
    "inflation can be realized in a vast number of ways , and these scenarios are typically distinguishable via their predictions for the statistical properties of the primordial perturbations .",
    "some models are purely _ ad hoc _ , while others satisfy naturalness constraints , or can be derived from candidate theories of fundamental physics . given the plethora of models that exist , it is fruitful to consider the corresponding inverse problem : given cosmological data , can we deduce the mechanism underlying inflation ?",
    "this problem is often referred to as _ reconstruction _",
    "ideally , reconstruction would recover the effective action of the `` inflationary sector '' of high energy physics , but carrying out this program for a fully general scenario is not likely to be feasible , even with data from the next generation of astrophysical experiments .",
    "consequently , present - day implementations of reconstruction incorporate a ( sometimes implicit ) prior restricting attention to a specific category of models  usually a single inflaton with a canonical kinetic term , minimally coupled to einstein gravity .",
    "this paper builds on the slow roll reconstruction algorithm , proposed by easther and peiris @xcite .",
    "slow roll reconstruction does not require the slow roll _ approximation _ , but rather relies on the truncated hamilton - jacobi slow roll _ expansion _",
    "this is a phenomenological description of inflation , obtained by expanding the hubble parameter as a power series , with the inflaton field as the independent variable or `` clock '' .",
    "we focus on scales which are directly probed by observations , making minimal assumptions regarding the reheating mechanism and the expansion history of the universe during the `` primordial dark age '' @xcite .",
    "given the long history of the inflationary inverse problem , slow roll reconstruction has a number of antecedents .",
    "in particular , other approaches to the inverse problem based on the hamilton - jacobi equations include ref .",
    "@xcite and `` monte carlo reconstruction '' @xcite , which was further developed in refs  @xcite . separately ,",
    "@xcite constrained the slow roll parameters by requiring that the duration of inflation was sufficient to solve the classic cosmological problems , while cline and hoi reconstructed inflationary models that allow for a significant running of the scalar spectral index within the hamilton - jacobi formalism  @xcite .",
    "leach and collaborators constrained inflation by writing the spectral indices in terms of the slow roll parameters @xcite . a similar scheme to slow roll reconstruction was discussed in refs .",
    "likewise , ref .",
    "@xcite used the wmap5 dataset and sdss data release 7 lrg data to constrain the hubble slow roll parameters , while ref .",
    "@xcite obtained constraints on the power spectra of curvature and tensor perturbations using priors based on single field slow roll inflationary models .",
    "we implement slow roll reconstruction within modecodehiranya / modecode ] , a publicly available solver for the inflationary background and perturbations @xcite .",
    "as shown by liddle @xcite the background dynamics corresponding to the truncated slow roll hierarchy can be solved analytically , yielding the corresponding inflationary potential @xmath3 . adding this potential to the menu of models supported within modecode  yields a simple and robust implementation of slow roll reconstruction .",
    "further , modecode   performs a full numerical computation of the inflationary perturbation spectrum , making no use of the slow roll approximation when computing the power spectrum .",
    "we then estimate the slow roll parameters using the wmap7 data , and the recent spt and sdss dr7 data releases .",
    "the principal advantage of implementing slow roll reconstruction within modecode   is that , by using the nested sampler multinest  @xcite with cosmomc  @xcite , we compute bayesian evidence at each order in the truncated slow roll hierarchy .",
    "this information determines the number of slow roll parameters that are required to account for the data , and thus the optimal order at which to truncate the hierarchy .",
    "in addition , we carefully construct the priors for the slow roll parameters to ensure that the computed evidence values are realistic @xcite .",
    "finally , we compute two heuristic model selection statistics  the profile likelihood ratio and the akaike information criterion  for the truncated slow roll hierarchy , and compare these to the bayesian inferences .",
    "this is the third in a sequence of papers on bayesian analysis of inflation , and optimal approaches to constraining inflationary models with astrophysical data .",
    "the first @xcite focussed on estimating the free parameters in specific inflationary models , while the second @xcite addressed the model selection problem in inflation and the computation of bayesian evidence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : srr ] we describe slow roll reconstruction and summarize its strengths .",
    "section [ sec : method ] contains a detailed description of our analysis , and summarizes the data used to generate the constraints .",
    "we present our results in section [ sec : results ] , and summarize the implications of our findings in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "during inflation the background metric is well - described by the flat friedmann robertson walker metric @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the scale factor and , as usual , the hubble parameter @xmath6 where dots denote derivatives with respect to time , @xmath7 .",
    "inflation is , by definition , a period of accelerated expansion during which @xmath8 .",
    "slow roll reconstruction @xcite is based on the inflationary flow hierarchy .",
    "this is obtained by rewriting the second friedmann equation , @xmath9 , as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the reduced planck mass and primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "we define the slow roll parameters , @xmath13 : @xmath14 ^ 2 \\equiv \\epsilon\\ ] ] for @xmath15 , and @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "these are related to the hubble slow roll parameters by noting that @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we obtain the hamilton - jacobi equations @xcite by differentiating @xmath20 with respect to @xmath12 , yielding an infinite hierarchy of differential equations where @xmath21 is determined by the two previous terms in the expansion .",
    "if @xmath22 for all @xmath23 at a specific value of @xmath12 , the hierarchy truncates , and these terms must be zero for all values of @xmath12 . as pointed out by liddle @xcite , this ensures that the higher - order derivatives of @xmath24 vanish for all @xmath12 , which is equivalent to requiring that @xmath24 is a polynomial of finite order , @xmath25 where a subscript @xmath26 denotes a quantity evaluated at @xmath27 .",
    "multiplying @xmath28 by a constant leaves the @xmath20 unchanged ; as we will see below , @xmath29 corresponds to the overall energy scale of the inflationary era .",
    "the coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 in equation ( [ eq : srrdef ] ) are then related to the hubble slow roll parameters by @xmath33 the system is not modified by the shift @xmath34 , but this rescaling does implicitly redefine the @xmath35 .",
    "we remove this ambiguity without loss of generality by assuming that the slow roll parameters are measured at the instant at which @xmath36 .",
    "further , the slow roll hierarchy simplifies when @xmath37 , leading to a distinct class of solutions , and we test both ",
    "n - parameter \" and  low-@xmath0 n - parameter \" models @xcite in what follows .",
    "given an expression for @xmath24 we can always obtain the corresponding potential @xmath3 @xcite by recalling that @xmath38 and replacing @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41\\,.\\label{eq : v}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this expression is a function of the @xmath35 and thus the slow roll parameters , so slow roll reconstruction can be implemented by adding equation  ( [ eq : v ] ) to the `` menu '' of inflationary models supported by modecode  @xcite .",
    "the fourier components of the scalar and tensor modes @xmath42 and @xmath43 are obtained by solving @xmath44 where @xmath45 and the subscript @xmath46 denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath47 .",
    "initial conditions for these modes are set by the bunch - davies vacuum when the mode @xmath48 is well within the horizon , and the amplitude of the power spectrum , defined by @xmath49 is computed from the solution when the mode is much larger than the horizon and frozen in : @xmath50 as usual , @xmath51 denotes the curvature perturbations in comoving gauge , and sometimes the notation @xmath52 is used .",
    "the amplitude of the power spectrum can also be computed in the slow roll approximation . evaluated at @xmath53 ( the scale which exits the horizon as @xmath27 ) , the amplitude is given in terms @xmath29 and the slow roll parameters by : @xmath54 ^ 2}{\\pi\\epsilon_\\ast } \\frac{h_\\ast^2}{8\\pi}\\ , , \\label{eq : asr}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 denotes @xmath56 to second order in the slow - roll expansion . here ,",
    "@xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the euler - mascheroni constant @xcite .",
    "slow roll reconstruction treats the individual terms in the slow roll hierarchy as free parameters . by implementing the potential , equation  ( [ eq : v ] ) , within modecode  @xcite we obtain posterior distributions for @xmath59 ( or subsets of these variables ) and compute bayesian evidence to determine the optimal truncation - order for this expansion .",
    "modecode  modifies cosmomc  @xcite , which is used in conjunction with the multinest  sampler @xcite .",
    "consider the probability distribution for a set of parameters @xmath60 , given a model @xmath61 and the data @xmath62 , denoted by @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "bayes theorem yields the _ posterior _ @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the likelihood , @xmath66 is the prior , and @xmath67 is the bayesian evidence .",
    "since the probability is normalized to unity we can compute the evidence directly , via @xmath68 which is an @xmath69-dimensional integral over a volume defined by the parameter ranges permitted by the prior .    using bayes theorem again ,",
    "we have @xmath70 given the _ a priori _ probability ratio @xmath71 , @xmath72 yields the ratio of probabilities for the two models , in the light of the data .",
    "any _ a priori _ preference for @xmath73 over @xmath74 is quantified by @xmath71 ; this ratio is always set to unity in our analysis .",
    "consequently , the evidence ratio @xmath72 expresses the relative  betting odds \" for two models .",
    "the evidence , equation  ( [ eq : evidence ] ) , depends on both the value ( or height , given that this is a positive definite integrand ) of the likelihood @xmath75 and the total volume of the parameter space .",
    "the evidence thus encodes the understanding that a model in which @xmath75 has a substantial amplitude over a large fraction of the permitted parameter volume is more predictive than one which does not @xcite .",
    "we fix @xmath27 to correspond to the time when the pivot scale @xmath53 leaves the horizon and choose @xmath76 .",
    "we sample the slow roll parameters at the pivot scale , with priors specified in section [ sec : models ] . in principle , the initial value of the field @xmath77 is determined by the value of @xmath12 at the onset of inflation , or at which the density approaches planckian values . in practice , the largest physical scale to which data are sensitive is @xmath78 and we set @xmath77 by solving for the value of @xmath12 at which the mode with wavenumber @xmath79 leaves the horizon .",
    "the initial value of @xmath80 is fixed using the slow roll attractor @xmath81 .",
    "we discard models for which inflation breaks down ( _ i.e. _ @xmath82 ) as the field evolves from @xmath83 to @xmath27 , as these scenarios are not consistent with the assumption that the primordial universe is inflating .",
    "the smallest scale we consider is @xmath84 which we take to be @xmath85 , the smallest scale accessible to cosmological observations .",
    "the power spectrum is computed from the amplitudes of the solutions to the mode equations when the corresponding scale is far outside the horizon , so for self - consistency we require inflation to last until @xmath84 is a hundred times larger than the horizon . assuming @xmath28 to be roughly constant during inflation ( which is consistent with limits from data ) , this puts a lower bound on the number of @xmath86-folds of inflation occurring after the pivot scale leaves the horizon , @xmath87 we discard models with fewer than @xmath88 @xmath86-folds , measured from the instant @xmath53 leaves the horizon .    as implemented here",
    ", slow roll reconstruction only considers the piece of the potential which is directly probed by cosmological data .",
    "this amounts to marginalizing over the value of @xmath12 at which inflation ends  physically , this can occur for example because the potential has a sharp `` cliff '' at some value of @xmath12 for which @xmath82 when computed from equation  ( [ eq : v ] ) . alternatively , this algorithm can also be implemented by evolving @xmath12 until inflation naturally terminates ( @xmath89 ) and then imposing a prior based on the total number of @xmath86-foldings that occur after the pivot scale leaves the horizon @xcite . by contrast , in this analysis we assume nothing about the evolution of the universe after @xmath84 has reached its asymptotic value after leaving the horizon .      the parameters which define the hubble slow roll model to third order in the expansion defined in eq .",
    "are @xmath29 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "but for all the models we consider , @xmath29 can , in principle , vary over many orders of magnitude and there is little clear _ a priori _ theoretical justification for restricting this range .",
    "however , given the slow roll parameters , we see from equation that @xmath29 is strongly correlated with the amplitude of the primordial spectrum . consequently , we treat @xmath56 , the amplitude of the primordial scalar power spectrum , for which the choice of prior range is more straightforward , as an independent parameter with a logarithmic prior .",
    "we allow a range that is generous relative to current constraints on this parameter ( e.g. ref .",
    "however our results do not depend significantly on the specific choice , and setting a narrower range in the prior would implicitly inject information from the data used to compute the posterior .",
    "we obtain @xmath29 directly from equation , given values for @xmath55 and the slow roll parameters .",
    "this is the one point at which we use the slow roll _ approximation _ ; the precise amplitude of the power spectrum at the pivot @xmath56 extracted from a numerical solution of the mode equations differs slightly from @xmath55 . in principle",
    "we could solve numerically for the exact value of @xmath29 needed to reproduce @xmath56 , but @xmath29 only changes at the level of a few percent if this is done .",
    "note that the slow roll approximation is used only in order to set this prior ; for the likelihood computation the numerical solution for @xmath56 is used .",
    "the specific set of models we consider is :    * `` @xmath90 only '' : @xmath93 , @xmath90 and @xmath55 are varied .",
    "* `` @xmath91 only '' : @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath91 and @xmath55 are varied . * `` @xmath90 , @xmath91 '' : @xmath95 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath55 are varied . * `` @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 '' : all parameters varied .",
    "the `` @xmath91 only '' case is the `` low-@xmath0 , 1-parameter '' scenario described in ref .",
    "@xcite : when @xmath0 is much smaller than @xmath96 , it effectively decouples from the slow roll hierarchy , meaning that the inflationary dynamics are then independent of the exact value of @xmath0 and are determined by the other slow roll parameters , @xmath1 in this case .",
    "we implement this by fixing @xmath90 to a small , finite value and have checked that the results we obtain are insensitive to the specific choice at which we fix @xmath90 .",
    "we consider both uniform and logarithmic priors on @xmath90 , and impose uniform priors on @xmath91 and @xmath92 . since the tensor - to - scalar ratio is strongly correlated with @xmath0 , a uniform prior for this parameter biases the analysis toward models where inflation occurs at high energy scales , which are likely to produce a significant background of tensor perturbations @xcite",
    "likewise , @xmath55 is drawn from a logarithmic prior .",
    "the prior ranges for all model parameters are listed in table [ tab : ranges ] , while the priors for other free cosmological parameters are specified in table [ tab : cosmoranges ] .",
    ".prior ranges for the model parameters .",
    "runs are performed with both log and uniform priors on @xmath90 ; the corresponding ranges are given in the first two rows .

    "note that the biggest improvement attained by including the spt and lrg data is in the measurement of @xmath91 , for which the data indicates a non - zero value , but this improvement is not highly significant ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "note also that when @xmath92 is included , it is measured to be very small , with large uncertainties ; this already hints at the fact that its inclusion is not required in order to fit the data .",
