    ".    theorem [ thm : converse_diff+_detailed ] extends and completes the work initiated in @xcite on converse theorems for normally hyperbolic attractors given by a unique fixed point or by a limit cycle .",
    "the argument for these converse results is based on the properties of the koopman operator @xcite .",

    "the proof is constructive , leading to a numerical algorithm for the construction of the cone field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) .",
    "however , the approach in @xcite does not extend to the general one - dimensional normally hyperbolic attractors considered in theorem [ thm : converse_diff+_detailed ] .",
    "for attractors containing several fixed points , a cone field from koopman eigenfunctions is well - defined in the basin of attraction of each fixed point , but the patching of these cone fields in the whole basin of attraction of the one - dimensional attractor is not necessarily well defined .",
    "the relevance of the normal hyperbolicity property for theorem [ thm : converse_diff+_detailed ] is readily illustrated by a comparison of the attractors in figure [ fig : example ] .",

    "@xmath372 is normally hyperbolic .",
    "the transversal convergence towardss the attractor is dominated by the motion within the attractor .",
    "this attractor is compatible with differential positivity .",

    "@xmath373 is not normally hyperbolic since unstable and stable manifolds of the saddle merge .",
    "thus , there is no invariant splitting of the tangent bundle at @xmath373 .",

    "however , for any point @xmath31 on the homoclinic orbit we have that @xmath378 despite @xmath379 .",
    "this contradicts the continuity of @xmath8 .",
    "a similar argument can be developed from the invariance of the cone field @xmath1 . by invariance",
    ", @xmath380 must contain both the tangent vectors @xmath381 and @xmath382 respectively tangent to the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle .",
    "for instance , ( i ) @xmath383 is the dominant eigenvector of the linearized flow on @xmath52 therefore @xmath384 ; ( ii ) by continuity , @xmath385 for any @xmath31 on the homoclinic orbit .",
    "thus , the tangent vector @xmath113 to the homoclinic orbit at @xmath31 belongs to @xmath114 and , by differential positivity @xmath386 .",
    "therefore , @xmath387 .",
    "however , considering the eigenvalues @xmath388 of the linearization at the saddle @xmath52 , we have @xmath389 and @xmath390 which contradicts the projective contraction property , since @xmath391 .",
    "differential analysis , or the study of the nonlinear map through the properties of its linearization , is a classical topic of dynamical systems theory .",
    "we have shown that behaviors that asymptotically converge to a one - dimensional normally hyperbolic attractor can be characterized differentially : their linearizations are _ positive _ , they contract a cone field .",
    "this characterization can be thought as analog to the differential characterization of behaviors that asymptotically converge to a hyperbolic fixed point ; those behaviors that contract a `` ball field '' , that is , a riemannian metric .",
    "the result once more stresses the importance of hyperbolicity in differential analysis .",
