    "celeste was a cherenkov experiment using 53 heliostats of the former lectricit de france solar plant in the french pyrenees at the thmis site .",
    "it detected cherenkov light from electromagnetic showers produced in the atmosphere by the @xmath0-rays coming from high energy astrophysical sources .",
    "the light is reflected to secondary optics and photomultipliers installed at the top of the tower .",
    "finally it is sampled to be analysed ( par 2002 ) .    to constrain the energy scale of the experiment we improved the optics simulation , now in good agreement with the data .",
    "the data analysis has also been improved so that we have better background rejection .",
    "we present the light curve for mrk  421 .",
    "the simulation has been reexamined to reduce the uncertainties on the energy scale of the experiment ( brion 2003 ) .",
    "the lidar operating on the site for atmospheric monitoring provided a better determination of the atmospheric extinction ( bussns gordo 2004 ) . a stellar photometry study , focussing on the comparison between simulations and data on bright stars currents , has been done on the star 51  uma ( m@xmath1 ) which is in the field of view ( fov ) of mrk  421 .",
    "this showed that the old simulation was too optimistic .",
    "all mirror reflectivities were decreased subsequent to new measurements .",
    "the nominal focussing of the heliostats was degraded after a study of star image sizes .",
    "we also verified the photomultiplier gains .",
    "the results for the old data set ( 40  heliostats , new is 53  helisotats , see    [ sec : analysis ] ) are presented in figure  [ fig : simulation ] : the effect of these changes is smaller for @xmath0-ray showers ( an extended light source ) than for stars ( point sources ) .    off illumination from the star 51  uma ( m@xmath1 ) in the fov of mrk  421 as a function of hour angle for pointing at 11  km : the new simulation with our corrections ( red stars ) fits the data well ( black squares ) whereas the old simulation ( blue circles ) was 50  % too high.,width=264 ]    this study helped us to perform our selection criteria for the data : all data that are too low in currents on the star have also low trigger rates . in order to trigger celeste , the heliostats , except the _ veto _ ( see   [ sec : veto ] ) ,",
    "are split into 6  groups . for each of them ,",
    "the analog sum of signals gives the first level trigger .",
    "then , a logical pattern is defined on the majority of the triggering groups .",
    "thus , in the case of the source mrk  421 , we reject all data with trigger rates under 20  hz for the old data set and under 16  hz for the new data set .",
    "we also looked at the proton rates as a standard candle for the detector which should be stable for good quality nights .",
    "these rates are determined with high offline threshold cuts to avoid trigger bias , and are therefore low ( typical trigger rates @xmath2  hz ) .",
    "we ve shown that they are correlated with the currents on star 51  uma for selected data ( new data set , figure  [ fig : protonrate ]  ( a ) ) . the data with low rates are now still rejected but perhaps some of them could be corrected . indeed , three doubtful zones , a , b and c on the figure , can be distinguished .",
    "the zone a can be interpreted as bad nights with thick cloud cover ( weak star , little cherenkov light ) , the zone b as nights with aerosols and above average extinction of cherenkov and starlight , and the zone c as nights with high clouds that stop starlight but not cherenkov light .",
    "the data in this last zone may therefore be used .",
    "figure  [ fig : protonrate ]",
    "( b ) shows the correlation between the proton rate and the trigger rate for the same data set . defining a selection criteria for each type of acquisition , and based only on these rates",
    ", would be very interesting for sources that do nt have any star nearby for a photometry study .",

    "since the 2000 status of the experiment ( de naurois 2002 ) three main changes were made for the analysis .",
    "first , the selection criteria of the data are stricter for the current and trigger rate stability , and as we ve shown for the trigger and proton rate value ( work in progress ) .",
    "the experiment has been upgraded from 40 to 53 heliostats .",
    "we use part of them to broaden our narrow fov .",
    "finally , we have found a new method to exploit the fadc information to reject the hadronic background ( manseri 2004 a , b ) . the second and third point",
    "are developed hereafter .",
    "hadronic showers have a more chaotic and extended development than electromagnetic showers .",
    "to measure the extent of the shower , we artificially broaden the fov : as before , all heliostats aim at 11  km above the ground in the direction of the source , where the maximum of the shower is supposed to occur in our energy range . but",
    "12  heliostats , distributed around the edge of the field , sample a ring of 150  m around that point ( figure  [ fig : principeveto ] ) .",
    "because of the compactness of electromagnetic showers , the light does not illuminate these 12  heliostats , named _ veto _ ,",
    "contrary to hadronic showers ( figure  [ fig : nbvetomc ] ) .",
    "so we require that no _ veto _ be illuminated .",
    "to detect low energy @xmath0-rays , we use the sum of the individual digitized signals to increase the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "the summation includes a correction for the sphericity of the wavefront , assumed to be centered in the 11  km plane . assuming a wrong position for this center ( impact parameter ) broadens the sum : the height - over - width ratio , @xmath5 , decreases .",
    "we compute @xmath5 for different assumed positions .",
    "the impact parameter is the position for which the @xmath5 ratio is maximum , denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "this is valid for @xmath0-rays ( figure  [ fig : timing ]  ( a ) ) but not for protons for which the wavefront is not spherical ( figure  [ fig : timing ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "a measurement of the flatness of these 2d - distributions is given by the following estimator : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the average of @xmath5 over 24 positions along a ring 200  m from the maximum position .",
    "for @xmath0-rays there is a clear maximum and this estimator takes low values . for hadrons",
    ", it is usually larger ( figure  [ fig : timing ] ( c ) ) .",
    "we have applied @xmath9 .",
    "ray and ( b ) for a 500 gev proton .",
    "( c ) distribution of the @xmath10 parameter for @xmath0-rays and off data . ]",
    "a cut on this estimator is the biggest contribution to an improvement in crab sensitivity from 2.2  @xmath11 to 5.8  @xmath11 .",
    "the crab detection is also stable ( figure  [ fig : crab ] ) .",
    "this stable analysis and good sensitivity provide a good detection of the mrk  421 flares . a 19  @xmath12 detection during 10  h since october 2002 gives a mean of 5.6  @xmath13min .",
    "the light curve is presented in figure  [ fig : mrk421 ] . with the new acceptances we will deduce a spectral measurement for mrk  421 with smaller uncertainties .",

    "since the data have been taken in the same conditions as for the crab , we can use the sensitivity of 5.8  @xmath11 to remark that for a 3  @xmath12 observation for these 4.4  h data , the flux  @xmath15 would have to be @xmath16 .",
