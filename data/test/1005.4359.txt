    "systems made of ionised atoms confined into penning  @xcite or paul  @xcite traps provide interesting prototypes of low - dimensional many - particle systems .",
    "confinement is enforced by the application of static ( penning ) and/or time - dependent electromagnetic fields ( paul ) and temperature can be reduced to the mk range by laser cooling  @xcite .",
    "systems composed of atoms ranging in number from a few tens to several thousand are routinely made and their properties analysed by a broad range of spectroscopic techniques  @xcite .",
    "fine control of the ion density @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 allows to experimentally probe a wide range of inter - particle couplings , whose strength is measured by the ratio @xmath2 between the potential and kinetic energy of the ions . at sufficiently high coupling ( @xmath3 , see ref .  [ ] ) , ions condense into a regular lattice , fulfilling early predictions generally attributed to wigner  @xcite .",
    "such a transition has been observed in trapped clouds made of single  @xcite or binary  @xcite ion species , providing an intriguing view of ordered coulomb systems at low temperature and high couplings  @xcite . upon changing @xmath0 , @xmath1 or the shape and strength of the applied fields ,",
    "these systems undergo a sequence of characteristic structural changes such as order - disorder  @xcite and isomerisation transitions  @xcite .",
    "recently , experiments  @xcite and computational studies  @xcite have focused on one specific phase change taking place in nearly 1d trapped - ion systems , transforming linear chains into zig - zag configurations  @xcite .",
    "simple consideration of the forces active in and on the system suggests that such a transition arises from the competition between the interaction with the external field ( increasing upon the transition ) and the electron - electron repulsion , which decreases because of the larger nearest neighbour distance in zig - zag chains .",
    "the order of the transition is not precisely known and , strictly speaking , not even well defined for the finite samples probed in experiments .",
    "however , computations for extended systems with periodic boundary conditions suggest that the transition is continuous and second order , with a discontinuity in the second derivative of the ground state energy with respect to the 1d ion density  @xcite .",
    "the linear to zig - zag transition has a number of different implications on the system properties . in the case of ions carrying a magnetic ( spin ) moment , for instance , changing the amplitude of the zig - zag modulation changes the number and relative distance of the ions neighbours , and , by varying the relative weight of first and second nearest neighbour interactions",
    ", it provides a way to tune the spin - spin coupling  @xcite . at the same time , the zig - zag transition doubles the unit cell of the system , thus changing even qualitatively the vibrational spectrum of the chain .",
    "interestingly , the dimerisation that often accompanies the zig - zag transition could open the way to the bose - einstein condensation of ions whose spin is half integer . finally , the link between the structural transitions seen in experiments and the behaviour of quantum correlations among the trapped ions has been established by a theoretical study based on techniques typical of continuous - variable systems  @xcite .    besides providing an appealing playground to investigate the interplay between dimensionality and many - particle effects , quasi-1d atomic plasmas",
    "are actively investigated in view of applications in metrology  @xcite and in quantum information technology  @xcite . moreover , low temperature ions confined in a quasi-1d ion trap have been proposed as models for the analogic simulation of many - particle systems  @xcite . in most of these applications ,",
    "quantum mechanics plays an important role .",
    "this observation has motivated us to study quasi-1d systems made of electrons , whose light mass amplifies the quantum mechanical effects . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "low - dimensional many - electron plasmas confined at low temperature into electromagnetic traps have not been made and characterised in experiments .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that there is a considerable interest in scaling up the already experimentally demonstrated ability to trap and coherently control a single electron in a penning trap to a genuine quantum many - body configuration .",
    "roadmaps towards the achievement of such a situation have been detailed in ref .  [ ] .",
    "it is worth reminding that closely related systems , consisting of mobile electrons in conducting nano - wires can be prepared by a variety of methods , including the controlled doping of semiconducting nanostructures  @xcite and conducting polymers  @xcite .",
    "moreover , new fabrication methods are being developed based on the doping or the electrostatic biasing of carbon nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "the properties of electrons in these systems are often described using the one - component plasma picture  @xcite , thus representing electrons as independent particles moving in a fixed external potential .",
    "we resort to the simplest version of this approach , based on the jellium model  @xcite , in which the external potential confining the electrons is due to their coulomb interaction with a cylindrical background of positive charge , whose density is constant ( @xmath4 ) within a pre - defined volume and zero outside . in order to approach the conditions of interest for charged particles in a trap , we consider the limit of very thin wires with a large aspect ratio between the length @xmath5 and the radius @xmath6 of the background charge distribution ( @xmath7 ) . in our computation , many - body effects are accounted for by resorting to the simple local - spin density ( lsd ) approximation  @xcite to density functional ( df ) theory  @xcite .",
    "single electron orbitals are expanded on a large basis of plane waves , and the ground state energy and density are determined by direct minimisation , without any symmetry restrictions .",
    "we focus our attention on the low density , high correlation regime , where the wigner crystal is the stable phase , and we consider various combinations of spin - up and spin - down populations .    our calculations demonstrate the existence of linear and zig - zag chains , stabilised by different combinations of the 1d electron density , spin configuration and shape of the confining potential .",
    "furthermore , our results display other unforseen structures , never considered or found so far for classical ion systems .",
    "dimers , already suggested long ago for quantum spin chains  @xcite , appear at low density . at intermediate densities ,",
    "we find new geometries , such as helices , and even double helices .",
    "hints of these exotic geometries were already given by calculations for larger wires at much lower density  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this basic information on the ground state density and spin configuration , our results provide a wealth of new data on the density of states , the electric conductivity and the vibrational modes of nearly 1d electron systems .",
    "in particular , we give strong evidence of a second - order nature of the linear - to - zig - zag transition , a result that appears to be in line with the findings in ref . [",

    "low dimensional assemblies of ions trapped into static and time - dependent electromagnetic fields have been extensively investigated in the past , both computationally and experimentally , and could find applications in metrology and in quantum information . at the conditions of present experiments , the motion of ions is classical , even though quantum mechanical aspects ( strictly required for quantum information applications ) are associated to the orientation and dynamics of spin moments .",
    "recently , many experiments and calculations have been devoted , in particular , to analyse the so - called linear to zig - zag transition  @xcite taking place in nearly 1d ion systems upon varying the linear density of ions and/or changing the geometric parameters of the confining potential . in our paper , we have investigated the geometric and magnetic structure , electronic properties and low energy phonon - like excitations of nearly 1d electron systems confined by the electrostatic potential of a very thin cylindrical distribution of positive charge .",
    "we have considered a wide range of relative spin populations @xmath12 and @xmath13 and focused on the low density regime ( @xmath51 ) , where electrons tend to localise giving rise to blobs of negative charge distributed in space . in many respects ,",
    "this model represents the quantum counterpart of the classical ion systems .",
    "the results of our computations , carried within dft - lsd , show that the quantum system displays a much wider variety of configurations and properties than in the classical case . in fully spin - polarised systems , we observe the stability of helicoidal density distributions for @xmath135 , turning into a twisted string of localised charge dimers at lower density .",
    "spin - compensated samples at @xmath135 display an intriguing double - helix structure , whose two strands have opposite spin polarisation . the double helix unrolls into two linear chains of opposite spin at densities around @xmath59 , providing one of the few examples of virtually planar , zig - zag configuration found in our computations .",
    "also in the case of globally spin - compensated samples , charge dimers form at lower density ( @xmath136 ) with a predominantly ferromagnetic coupling within each dimer and anti - ferromagnetic coupling among dimers .",
    "the spin - spin coupling , however , is low at densities such that @xmath53 , and a sizable amount of disorder is observed in the distribution of spins . at all densities , computations with a single spin - reversed impurity in an otherwise ferromagnetic sample",
    "reveal localised magnetic and structural defects , which might dominate the response of low density electron chains to external perturbations .",
    "the density of states for the kohn - sham eigenvalues consists of several bands , some of them partially overlapping , some other disjoint , according to density , aspect ratio and spin population .",
    "the ferromagnetic samples analysed in our study tend to be open - shell systems up to the lowest densities we investigated ( @xmath60 ) , while spin - compensated samples are closed shell systems with a fairly wide gap separating occupied ks states from unoccupied ones .",
    "the open - shell character of the ferromagnetic systems , together with the defects found in fully or partially spin - compensated cases , give rise to the non negligible low - frequency conductivity predicted by the kubo - greenwood formula for most of the samples investigated in our study .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "linear assemblies of electrons have never been made experimentally by the techniques used to trap atomic ions , although interesting experimental efforts on the single electron scenario are paving the way to an up - scaling .",
    "our results provide additional motivations for experimental investigations along this line .",
    "our findings suggest that electron systems of this kind , if ever realised , would exhibit a broad range of unusual and surprising properties , which could also find useful applications .    from a fundamental standpoint , our analysis provides a useful complement to theoretical results obtained using classical simulation approaches by emphasising quantum mechanical and spin effects that might become important even in ion systems at sufficiently low @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the density iso - surfaces computed in our study provide a more comprehensive view of the ground state properties than the information given by low energy geometries of classical many - particle systems .",
    "the elongated structures seen in some of the density iso - surfaces describe above , for instance , are a pictorial representation of low energy valleys in the potential energy surface , suggesting patterns for low frequency excitations .",
    "it is worth remarking that many - electron systems of this kind are already being made in condensed matter , using controlled doping to introduce mobile electrons into polymers and into semiconductor nanostructures  @xcite , giving rise to quasi-1d structures whose size and density are not far from those considered in our study . in these cases , however , the measurement of the properties of the system and their interpretation are certainly more difficult than in the ion - trap scenario .",
    "our work paves the way to a variety of new studies .",
    "for instance , an intriguing point to tackle would be the control of one of the `` defects '' found in our simulation samples .",
    "this could be realised by studying , via time - dependent density functional theory , the dynamics of the defect and its motion across the chain as induced by an external perturbative potential .",
    "it would be very interesting to study the effectiveness of this scenario for quantum communication protocols such as quantum state transfer , which are based on the use of quasi-1d lattices of interacting particles .",
