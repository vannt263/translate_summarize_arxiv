    "the increasing availability of large scale digital sky surveys spanning many wavelengths offers an unprecedented view of the universe .",
    "the positional matching of such surveys is of obvious scientific interest . not only can wide wavelength coverage provide a comprehensive description of the various classes of astrophysical object , but characterizing the most populous families can help isolating more peculiar , and usually more interesting , objects . in this contribution",
    "we discuss the matching of early sdss data with 2mass and first surveys .",
    "the details of this work are presented elsewhere ( finlator _ et al .",

    "_ 2000 , stoughton _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , and references therein ) is a digital photometric and spectroscopic survey which will cover one quarter of the celestial sphere in the north galactic cap and produce a smaller area ( @xmath0225 deg@xmath7 ) but much deeper survey in the southern galactic hemisphere .",
    "it utilizes five broad bands ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) with central wavelengths ranging from 3550    to 8930   , and will detect about 10@xmath13 stars and a similar number of galaxies brighter than @xmath022@xmath14 . for about one million brightest galaxies and 100,000 quasar candidates",
    "sdss will also obtain high - quality spectra . the 2mass ( skrutskie _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) surveyed the entire sky in near - infrared light ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 bands ) and catalogued @xmath0300 million stars , as well as several million galaxies . the first survey ( becker _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) provides the most comprehensive view of the universe at 20 cm and will detect about a million radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "of the three surveys discussed here , sdss provides the most detailed information about the detected objects due to its multi - color optical photometry , the highest angular resolution , and the spectroscopic data .",
    "the position of an object in sdss color - color and color - magnitude diagrams can be efficiently used to constrain its nature .",
    "the color - color and color - magnitude diagrams which summarize photometric properties of sdss sources are shown in figure 1 ( magnitudes are marked as @xmath18 because the calibration is still uncertain within 5% ) .",
    "we use the  model \" magnitudes , as computed by the photometric pipeline ( `` photo '' , lupton _",
    "et al . _ 2002 ) .",
    "the model magnitudes are measured by fitting an exponential and a de vacouleurs profile , and using the formally better model in @xmath19 to evaluate the magnitude .",
    "photometric errors are typically 0.03@xmath14 at the bright end ( @xmath20 ) , and increase to about 0.1@xmath14 at @xmath21 , the faint limit relevant in this work ( for more details see ivezi _ et al .",

    "we only briefly mention that the position of a star in color - color diagrams is mainly determined by its spectral type , as marked , and that the modeling of the stellar populations observed by sdss ( f00 ) indicates that the majority of these stars ( 99% ) are on the main sequence .",

    "practically all 2mass sources ( @xmath098% for point sources from the psc and @xmath097% for extended sources from the xsc ) are matched to an sdss source within 2 arcsec .",
    "about @xmath011% of the 2mass psc sources are optically resolved galaxies and the rest are dominated by stars . practically all ( @xmath098% ) sources from the 2mass xsc are associated with an optically resolved source .",

    "the top two panels show representative optical and near - ir diagrams for 10,000 stars , and the bottom two panels show analogous diagrams for a similar number of galaxies .",
    "the vertical dashed lines at @xmath26 in the two right panels roughly separate stars from galaxies in 2mass data ( only 22% of these galaxies are resolved in 2mass images ) . the horizontal dashed line in the lower left panel shows the magnitude limit for sdss spectroscopic galaxy survey .",
    "practically all sources from the 2mass xsc are brighter than that limit , and are shown as magenta dots ( on top of blue dots that mark sources from the 2mass psc ) .",

    "based on the matched source density , we project that by the completion of sdss the matched sdss-2mass sample will include about 10@xmath1 stars and 10@xmath2 galaxies",
    ". about half of these galaxies will be part of the sdss spectroscopic survey , and about about 10@xmath27 will have photometry better than 0.1 mag . in all 8 bands .",
    "figure 3 shows the color - color diagrams for stars and galaxies from figure 2 , which also have better than 10@xmath28 detections in all three 2mass bands .",
    "stars are shown as blue and red dots , separated by = 0.7 which approximately corresponds to k0 spectral type ( f00 ) .",
    "galaxies are shown as green and magenta dots , separated by @xmath29 which approximately separates spiral and elliptical galaxies ( s01 ) .",
    "the unresolved sources with optical colors indicative of low - redshift quasars are shown as blue circles ( open for sources with better than 5@xmath28 detections in all three 2mass bands and solid for better than 7@xmath28 ) .",
    "note that it is not possible to separate galaxies from stars using only optical colors ( see upper left panel ) .",
    "however , the addition of ir data allows nearly perfect separation , and the lines shown in the two right panels outline the regions populated by stars , galaxies and low - redshift quasars ( the i-@xmath17 color is based on the `` psf '' i  magnitude ) .",
    "this clean separation can be used to gauge the success of the sdss star - galaxy separation at the bright end .",
    "we find that 99.3% of the sources deemed as resolved by sdss photometric pipeline are found in the region marked as `` galaxies '' .",
    "the bottom left panel shows an infrared color - color diagram constructed with 2mass data . using sdss data we find that sources with @xmath30 are predominantly extragalactic , while the bluer sources are stars .",
    "dust - reddened quasars are hard to distinguish in optical color - color diagrams because the plausible reddening vectors are roughly parallel to the stellar locus .",
    "however , such objects may be more easily distinguishable from stars in optical - infrared color - color diagrams because the reddening moves objects from the region marked `` qsos '' to the region marked `` galaxies '' , thus missing the stellar locus ( because quasars have redder @xmath31 colors than stars ) .",
    "since sdss imaging data can easily separate optically unresolved and resolved sources , selecting sources with e.g. @xmath32 and @xmath33 can in principle reveal dust - obscured quasars . in a pilot study , we have obtained spectra for 30 optically unresolved sources from the region marked `` galaxies '' .",
    "most of them are m stars , and not a single one was confirmed to be a quasar .",
    "this null result places a strong upper limit on the fraction of reddened quasars .",
    "cutri _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 discuss the selection of red agns from the 2mass psc database using the condition that @xmath34 .",
    "these sources may be dust - reddened quasars with optical colors indistinguishable from those of stars and thus missed by sdss spectroscopic targeting of quasars .",
    "we have analyzed a sample of 241 such candidates selected from a 220 deg@xmath7 large region ( ivezi , cutri , nelson , _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) . the majority of these sources are optically resolved ( 226 ) , and are dominated by red ( elliptical ) galaxies ( 194 ) with redshifts up to 0.4 .",
    "their very red @xmath31 colors seem to be a consequence of the k correction .",
    "the majority of optically unresolved matches ( 13 out of 15 ) show uv excess indicative of quasars with redshifts @xmath232.5 and thus are easily distinguishable from stars using optical colors alone .",
    "this is confirmed for 9 sources for which sdss spectra are available .",
    "one of the remaining two unresolved sources is a confirmed l dwarf , and the other one has optical - infared colors consistent with also being an l dwarf .",
    "consequently , this preliminary analysis indicates that the fraction of moderately reddened quasars ( @xmath35 ) which are missed by sdss quasar survey is small .",
    "while the precise value of this fraction is somewhat model - dependent , it seems to be less than 10% .",
    "the positional matching of sdss and first sources is described in detail by ivezi _",
    "_ 2001 ( see also menou _ et al . _ 2001 and knapp _ et al .",
    "optical identifications can be made for 31% of first sources .",
    "the majority of the first sources identified with an sdss source are optically resolved , and their fraction among the matched sources is a function of the radio flux , increasing from 50% at the bright end to 90% at the first faint limit ( 1 mjy ) . the cumulative fraction of the optically unresolved sources among the sdss - first matches is 16% .",
    "the colors of optically unresolved sources , as well as sdss spectra for objects brighter than the flux cutoff for the spectroscopic targeting , indicate that they are dominated by quasars .",
    "figure 4 compares the differential radio counts for sdss - detected quasars , marked by dots , and galaxies , marked by triangles ( we introduced an ab radio magnitude defined as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the total radio flux ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the best fits in the 11.5 @xmath38 15.5 range : for quasars and for galaxies    we find no significant differences in the counts of first sources with and without an optical identification : they both follow @xmath39 relations . to illustrate this point",
    ", we compare the sum of counts for quasars and galaxies ( renormalized to account for the matching fraction ) , shown as open squares , to the counts of all first sources , shown by the solid line . as evident , the two distributions are similar .    based on the matched source density , by the completion of sdss and first the matched sample will include 250,000 galaxies and 50,000 quasars . as discussed in detail by ivezi _",
    "_ 2001 , the majority of these quasars are radio - loud .",
    "one of the most important advantages of a radio - selected sample of quasars is that it can be used to estimate the fraction of quasars with stellar colors that are missed by optical surveys , such as sdss .",
    "the majority of optically unresolved sdss - first sources have non - stellar colors .",
    "we find that the fraction of sources with colors indistinguishable from stellar is 10% , assuming that the colors of radio - loud ( @xmath40 , for more details see ivezi _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) quasars are similar to the colors of radio - quiet quasars .",
    "we do , however , detect a small but statistically significant difference between the colors of radio - loud quasars and radio - quiet quasars .",
    "the left panel in figure 5 shows the dependence of qso -i  color on redshift ( for a similar dependence of other sdss colors on redshift see richards _",
    "the distribution of optically selected and unresolved quasars with i@xmath24 19 is shown by contours .",
    "the 464 radio - loud quasars from the matched sample are shown as squares .",
    "the dashed line shows the median -i   color of all optically selected quasars in the redshift range 12 , which is subtracted from the -i  color to obtain a color excess .",
    "the right panel compares the distribution of this color excess for all optically selected quasars in that redshift range , shown by circles , to the distribution for 225 radio - loud quasars , shown by squares .",
    "the -i  color - excess distribution for radio quasars appears to be different from the distribution for the whole sample .",
    "first , the median excess for the radio subsample is redder by 0.05 mag , with about @xmath3 significance .",
    "second , the fraction of objects with very large color excess is larger for the radio subsample . adopting 0.5 mag for the minimum value of the color - excess , we find that 2.4@xmath410.2% of quasars have such extreme -i  colors , while this fraction is 7.1@xmath411.8% for the radio - loud quasars .",

    "the  vs.  color - magnitude diagram for sdss - first galaxies , shown by dots , compared to the distribution of all sdss galaxies , shown by linearly - spaced contours .",
    "the left panel shows the distribution of the sdss - first galaxies brighter than = 21.5 , and the right panel shows the distribution of galaxies for which sdss spectra are available . for details about the spectroscopic targeting of sdss galaxies",
    "see strauss _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 and eisenstein _ et al .",
    "the dashed lines outline regions with different galaxy morphology and fraction of radio galaxies , as listed in table 1 . at the bright optical end ( @xmath24 17.5 ) these radio - galaxies represent 5% of all sdss galaxies , with the radio fraction for red galaxies 2 times higher than for blue galaxies . in the magnitude range 17.5 @xmath24 @xmath24 20 , 0.5% of sdss galaxies are detected by first , and the radio fraction of the reddest galaxies , dominated by giant ellipticals , is 40 times larger than the radio fraction of the bluest galaxies .",
    "we find that radio galaxies in a redshift - limited sample have statistically indistinguishable colors and luminosity distribution from other galaxies from the same volume .",
    "nevertheless , the preliminary analysis of spectra indicates that the fraction of active galaxies is higher for the first - detected galaxies than for all sdss galaxies selected in the same regions of the optical color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "a more quantitative analysis of this effect will be presented in a future publication .",
    "the preliminary analysis of sources in common to sdss , 2mass and first surveys indicates the enormous potential of combining the modern digital sky surveys .",
    "the eight - color highly accurate photometry , the morphological information , radio properties , and redshift information for several orders of magnitude larger samples than previously available is bound to place the studies of extragalactic sources at an entirely new level .",
    "a good example of a result made possible by both a large sample and accurate photometry is the small , yet statistically significant , difference between the optical colors of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars .",
    "another result with potentially large astrophysical significance is the upper limit of 10% on the fraction of quasars with stellar colors , and finding that optical colors of first - detected galaxies are not significantly different from other galaxies in a volume - limited sample ."
