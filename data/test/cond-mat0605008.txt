    "the electrons populating the compressible strips screen the electric field , which leads to a metallic behavior when the electron density is redistributed ( compressed ) to keep the potential constant .",
    "the neighboring compressible strips are separated from each other by insulator - like incompressible strips corresponding to the fully filed landau levels with a constant electron density .",

    "<S> our calculations are based on the self - consistent green s function technique where the electron- and spin interactions are included within the density functional theory in the local spin density approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the evolution of the magnetosubband structure as magnetic field varies and show that it exhibits different features as compared to the case of a smooth confinement . in </S>",
    "<S> particularly , in the hard - wall wire a deep and narrow triangular potential well ( of the width of magnetic length @xmath0 ) is formed in the vicinity of the wire boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the wave functions are strongly localized in this well which leads to the increase of the electron density near the edges . because of the presence of this well , the subbands start to depopulate from the central region of the wire and remain pinned in the well region until they are eventually pushed up by increasing magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the spin polarization of electron density as a function of magnetic field shows a pronounced double - loop pattern that can be related to the successive depopulation of the magnetosubbands . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the case of a smooth confinement , in hard - wall wires the compressible strips do not form in the vicinity of wire boundaries and spatial spin separation between spin - up and spin - down states near edges is absent . </S>"
