    "accurate wave statistics is crucial to establish concise predictions as well as realistic design values for wave heights and wave - induced velocities . they can provide a good estimation on the air gap of fixed and tension leg offshore platforms",
    "velocities , in particular , are the primary input for wave - induced loads on surface and subsurface structures @xcite .",
    "nearshore , in a regime of finite water depth , wave kinematics significantly affect sediment transport processes @xcite .",
    "provided that waves are of small amplitude , i.e. assuming gentle sloping , the nonlinear water wave problem can be linearised and the irregular sea surface may then be reconstructed by a linear superposition of sinusoidal components @xcite . in statistical terms",
    ", this implies that waves can be considered as a stationary , ergodic and gaussian random process .",
    "assuming the process to be narrow - banded , it is known that wave amplitudes satisfy the rayleigh distribution . however , wave steepness is often too large for the linear theory to be valid in studying ocean waves in deep and coastal waters in a general framework . in terms of current design practice ,",
    "second - order nonlinear contributions are applied to account for the mutual interaction between wave components @xcite .",
    "general second - order corrections to linear solutions for the surface elevation @xmath0 and velocity potential @xmath1 are given in @xcite .",
    "note that second - order quasi - deterministic solutions ( see for instance @xcite ) may be more appropriate for particularly high amplitude waves .",
    "with respect to the water surface elevation , second - order nonlinearity generates high - frequency bound modes ( super - harmonics ) , which make wave crests higher and sharper while troughs are flatter and less deep compared to linear models .",
    "it also induces low - frequency components ( sub - harmonics ) , which produce a set - down under the most energetic wave groups @xcite . taking into account the fact that super - harmonics induce a dominant contribution @xcite , the probability density function ( @xmath2 ) of the surface elevation",
    "is then characterised by a positive skewness and substantial deviations of the upper and lower tails from the normal ( gaussian ) distribution @xcite .",
    "deviations from normality are reduced by directional spreading in deep - water and enhanced in finite water depths @xcite .    for the velocity potential , and consequently wave orbital velocities , second - order super- and sub - harmonics are of the same order of magnitude nearby the mean water level .",
    "nevertheless , below the surface , super - harmonics decay rapidly @xcite , while sub - harmonics retain a significant fraction of their energy @xcite .",
    "consequently , sub - harmonics produce a general increase of velocity below the troughs and decrease it below the crests for the most energetic wave groups .",
    "this effect amplifies with the distance from the surface @xcite .",
    "song and wu @xcite noted , numerically , that the @xmath2 of orbital velocity becomes negatively skewed with respect to the depth .",
    "this result , however , is neither confirmed by laboratory experiments nor by field observations@xcite .",
    "the effect of second - order nonlinear contribution on wave orbital velocity still remains unclear .",
    "as an example , it is not straightforward yet whether second - order variations to velocities are sufficiently strong to induce deviations of the upper and lower tails of the @xmath2 from the gaussian distribution .",
    "furthermore , the effect of wave directionality ( wave directional spreading ) has not been properly assessed yet .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , we revisit the contribution of second - order nonlinearity on wave orbital velocities with a stochastic second - order model @xcite . a brief analytical discussion of the second - order interaction kernels and effects on regular waves ( both mono- and bi - chromatics ) is discussed in the next section . in the following section [ res ] the stochastic model and its initial conditions are presented .",
    "results of monte - carlo simulations for unidirectional and directional wave fields are assessed in order to evaluate departures from the gaussian distribution , with particular focus on extreme values , i.e. deviations of the lower and upper tail of the distribution . a comparison with experimental velocity field data , collected in a large directional basin in infinite and finite depth conditions @xcite ,",
    "is also discussed .",
    "final remarks and a discussion with respect to the main reported results are presented in the conclusions .",
    "taking into account the second - order of nonlinearity , the velocity potential can be written as a sum of the linear solution of the euler equations for surface gravity water waves ( @xmath3 ) and a second - order correction consisting of super- and sub - harmonics , denoted by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively @xcite . under the hypothesis of inviscid fluid and irrotational potential flow ,",

    "hence , the skewness of a signal , that is composed by the linear solution and a @xmath52 second - order contribution , is very close to zero .",
    "this means that the resulting signal still remains a random gaussian process , i.e. skewness @xmath93 .",
    "if the contribution of @xmath53 is added , the skewness assumes negative values , departing from a gaussian process .",

    "wave directional spreading does not seem to have any notable effect on the skewness for @xmath58 .",
    "however , the skewness notably weakens with the broadening of the wave spectrum for @xmath54 .",

    "numerical simulations ( circles ) are plotted against experimental data ( crosses ) and the reference gaussian distribution ( continuous).,width=604 ]    overall , the upper and lower tails of the distribution substantially deviate from the gaussian distribution . at the second - order the positive velocities , associated to wave crests , are lower than gaussian . on the other hand",
    "the negative velocities , associated to wave troughs , are higher than gaussian , in absolute value .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of the set - down in the proximity of the most energetic groups .",
    "it is worth noting that this effect opposes the deviation observed for the surface elevation , where the positive values are under - estimated and negative values are over - estimated by the gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "simulations are in good agreement with laboratory experiments .",
    "as can be also noticed , the effect of wave directional spreading on the tail of the distribution is quite negligible in the numerical simulations .",

    "both tails tend to relax on the gaussian distribution , if the wave spectrum broadens in the directional domain ( see upper panels in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : ray1 ] ) .",
    "the effect of second - order nonlinearity on the horizontal component of the wave orbital motion was revisited with the general second - order wave model derived by sharma and dean @xcite .",
    "simple deterministic , monochromatic and bichromatic wave conditions were tested to assess the deformation of a linear solution due to super and sub - harmonics through the water column . monte - carlo simulations were carried out to analyse the contribution of second - order nonlinearity on the statistical properties of the orbital motion in random wave fields .",
    "the effect of water depth and directional spreading was also considered .",
    "tests on regular waves confirmed the absence of velocity second - order nonlinearity for self - interacting monochromatic waves in deep - water conditions . for finite water depth , in this case for a value of @xmath54 ,",
    "self - interaction produces super - harmonics nearby the surface .",
    "however , the super - harmonics rapidly decay with respect to the depth ; sub - harmonics are suppressed since the negative interaction kernel @xmath97 . on the other hand , when two different wave components ( bichromatic waves case ) interact with each other , sub - harmonics are generated , both in deep and intermediate water condition .",
    "these components induce a set - down of the velocity signal in the proximity of energetic waves , which enhances the backwards velocity below the troughs and decreases the forward speed below the crests . except for superficial sublayers ,",
    "in which super- and sub - harmonics have comparable energy contents , the sub - harmonics dominate the second - order nonlinearity through the water column , due to a much weaker decay rate .    in random sea states , the overall contribution of sub - harmonics characterises the second - order nonlinearity .",
    "due to the set - down under the most energetic wave groups , the probability density function of the horizontal velocity component @xmath27 becomes negatively skewed , in contrast to the positive skewness of the second - order surface elevation , deviating substantially from a gaussian distribution .",
    "this departure remains rather constant with depth for @xmath58 , while it increases with respect to the depth for @xmath54 .",
    "generally , directional spreading has only a marginal effect on skewness for @xmath58 , but it weakens second - order nonlinearity for @xmath54 .    as a further result of the set - down , the upper and lower tails of the @xmath2 of the horizontal velocity depart from the gaussian distribution , with second - order velocities below the troughs being under predicted and below the crests being over predicted .",
    "simulations revealed a relaxation towards gaussian statistics of the upper and lower tail for broad directional spreading .",
    "this fact was also confirmed by laboratory experiments , conducted in a large directional wave basin .",
