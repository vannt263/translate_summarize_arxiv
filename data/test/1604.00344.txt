    "electromagnetic waves in the microwave regime play an indispensable role in present plasma experiments .",
    "they are used for diagnostic and heating purposes in low- and high - temperature plasmas , see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite . in tokamak plasmas , for example , microwaves with a power in the mw regime are injected to stabilize so - called neoclassical tearing modes ( ntms ) .",
    "this instability modifies the plasma current profile by the generation of small scale magnetic islands and can ultimately lead to a disruption  @xcite . to suppress the growth of this instability , a localized current is driven by injected microwaves , in order to restore the original current profile  @xcite .",
    "microwaves emitted by the plasma , on the other hand , can be used to obtain , for example , the spatial distribution of the electron temperature or to investigate its dynamical behavior  @xcite .",
    "in all these cases , the microwaves have to traverse the plasma boundary , a region in which substantial density fluctuation levels as high as 100% are observed in fusion plasmas  @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations can disturb the microwaves injected into the plasma or emitted by it and thereby lead to reduced coupling efficiencies to the plasma or to ambiguous emission measurements , respectively .",
    "this paper seeks to allow an estimation of the perturbing effect of density fluctuations on a traversing microwave beam .",
    "the investigations of microwaves propagating through a plasma dates back to the beginning of ionospheric research , when microwaves emitted by strong astronomical radio sources were detected and studied on earth after they had passed through the ionosphere  @xcite or when radio waves were emitted from ground and their reflection from the ionosphere was studied  @xcite .",
    "microwave sources started to become available for substantial plasma heating and first numerical studies based on geometrical optics assumptions were performed in order to estimate the deteriorating effect of a turbulent plasma edge layer on an injected microwave beam  @xcite .",
    "recently , this topic has gained new momentum due to the importance of effective non - inductive current drive schemes in fusion relevant plasmas  @xcite .",
    "the work presented here investigates the perturbing effect of a turbulent plasma density layer on a traversing microwave beam by means of full - wave simulations .",
    "no restricting assumptions about the size or amplitude of the turbulent structures therefore need to be made .",
    "the full - wave treatment is required due to the large fluctuation levels that occur in fusion edge plasmas and due to the size of the density structures which can be on the order of the wavelength of the microwave .",
    "the properties of the turbulence are varied in a series of parameter scans in order to identify the most perturbing case .",
    "although full - wave simulations can be quite resource - demanding in terms of computational power and memory , their application has been increased recently to cases in magnetized plasmas where geometrical optics assumptions generally fail  @xcite .",
    "this has been made possible due to the continuously increasing computational power  @xcite and the creation of large scientifically focused computational cluster facilities .",
    "understanding and ensuring numerical stability of full - wave codes for cases with strong density gradients in magnetized plasmas is a topic of ongoing research  @xcite . a significant amount of that research deals with reflectometry , where an injected low - power microwave beam is _ reflected _ by the turbulent density layer ( instead of being _ transmitted _ like in the cases mentioned in the beginning ) and used to probe the turbulence layer itself  @xcite . for the scenarios considered here ( density below cut - off and moderate density gradients )",
    ", stability of the simulations is not an issue .",
    "this work is the continuation of a preceding study which dealt with the influence of single blob - like structures on a traversing microwave beam  @xcite .",

    "[ s.summary ] concludes the paper .",
    "this section briefly describes the codes that have been used to simulate the plasma microwave interaction and how the turbulent density profiles were generated .",
    "ipf - fdmc is a full - wave code based on the finite - difference time - domain scheme  @xcite .",
    "it solves maxwell s equations ( [ e.maxwell1 ] ) , ( [ e.maxwell2 ] ) and the fluid equation of motion for the electrons , eq .",
    "( [ e.ipffdmc_j ] ) , on a 2d cartesian grid .",
    "hence , it is based on a cold plasma description .",
    "the code has been used previously to study the o - sx mode conversion process and to investigate microwave heating in general ( see refs .",

    "an electron collision frequency @xmath2 is included in eq .",
    "( [ e.ipffdmc_j ] ) to resolve the energy accumulation which occurs if an x - mode encounters the upper - hybrid resonance .",
    "the emit-3d code  @xcite is also based on the finite - difference time - domain scheme . like ipf - fdmc , it is capable of simulating microwaves propagating through a cold magnetized plasma .",
    "it solves the equations , however , in a 3d geometry . due to the increased computational resources when going to a 3d treatment",
    ", extensive parameter scans are performed with the 2d code ipf - fdmc only .",
    "this is a valid simplification for the case of perpendicular injection ( with respect to the background magnetic field ) since the turbulence is essentially 2d in nature ( see sec .",
    "[ s.density ] for details ) . for a number of cases ,",
    "the results from both codes are compared .",
    "dedicated scenarios which require a 3d treatment are also presented and discussed .",
    "the injected microwave is modelled as a gaussian beam with the beam waist located in the antenna plane . neglecting the phase terms",
    ", the electric field distribution in the antenna plane reads @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the coordinate across the antenna and @xmath5 the spot size of the beam , i.e.  the radius at the beam waist .",
    "the default value for the simulations is @xmath6 with @xmath7 the vacuum wavelength of the injected microwave . despite the relatively small beam waist ,",
    "the divergence of the beam is negligible for the default size of the computational grid , which is @xmath8 .",
    "the interaction with the density turbulence occurs thus when the wave fronts of the microwave are still parallel , like in fusion plasmas , where the beam waists are usually larger by an order of magnitude .",
    "this grid has been chosen in order to be able to perform the required ensemble averaging ( as discussed in the following section ) within a reasonable computational time .",
    "an o - mode is injected at the bottom of the 2d grid and the background magnetic field @xmath9 is directed perpendicular to it .",
    "the normalized magnetic field is set to a constant value of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the angular frequency of the injected microwave .",
    "the boundaries of the simulation grid were set to be non - radiating .          on the time scale of the microwave ,",
    "the fluctuations appear to be frozen : the typical frequency scales are in the khz range  @xcite , whereas the microwave frequency lies in the ghz range .",
    "the important parameter is the group velocity of the injected o - mode which can be expressed as , with @xmath12 .",
    "if the turbulent structures are interpreted as drift - wave structures , their phase velocity can be estimated by the electron diamagnetic drift velocity , yielding values which are typically @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "hence , even if the density reaches values of 99.9% of the cut - off density , the resulting group velocity of the wave is still a factor of 1000 larger than the velocity of the density structures and the assumption of a frozen plasma in the frame of the microwave is therefore justified . to properly study the influence of density fluctuations on traversing microwaves",
    ", it is necessary to have a sufficiently large number of turbulent density profiles , since only averaging over an ensemble of profiles makes the results statistically relevant . a hasegawa - wakatani drift - wave turbulence model within the bout++ framework  @xcite",
    "is used to generate such a set of profiles which can be accessed at  @xcite .",
    "drift - wave turbulence is thought to be the dominant mechanism responsible for the anomalous transport observed in the tokamak plasma edge  @xcite .",
    "hasegawa and wakatani derived a simple model to describe this turbulence in a 2d unsheared magnetic field  @xcite , and it has been used both to simulate edge turbulence as well as to benchmark more complex models  @xcite .    the geometry in the full - wave simulations is such that a homogeneous background density @xmath14 is chosen onto which a layer of turbulent density is superimposed .",
    "figure  [ f.fullwave_grid ] shows an example , where the turbulence layer has a depth of @xmath15 in the @xmath16-direction .",
    "the spatial extension into the @xmath4-direction is @xmath17 and will not be varied .",
    "a smooth transition is employed over a few grid points between the homogeneous background plasma and the turbulence layer .",
    "the emitting antenna injecting a gaussian beam is placed at the lower boundary of the grid and a receiving antenna at the upper boundary of the grid .",
    "both antennas extend along the whole @xmath4-direction .",
    "the distance between the antennas and the boundary of the turbulence layer is set to one vacuum wavelength @xmath7 , i.e.  in fig .",
    "[ f.fullwave_grid ] , the emitting antenna is defined at @xmath18 and the receiving antenna at @xmath19 .",
    "since the simulations are based on a time - dependent scheme , they start with the injection of the microwave beam and are stopped when a steady state solution has been achieved . over the receiving antenna , the time - averaged wave electric field , reminiscent of an rms - value ,",
    "is continuously recorded as a function of the coordinate @xmath4 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the time coordinate , @xmath22 and the superscript  @xmath23  denotes the perturbation due to the .",
    "such an antenna signal is acquired for each turbulence slice considered .",
    "figure  [ f.detant_signal ] shows this signal for a few turbulence slices together with the signal for the homogeneous , i.e.  the unperturbed case .",
    "the effect of the turbulence on the microwave can be clearly seen .    to quantify the scattering of the microwave beam ,",
    "two different methods are used .",
    "the first method consists of calculating a scattering parameter @xmath24 as the sum of the squared deviations of the @xmath25 signal between the turbulence case and the homogeneous case : @xmath26 this compresses the result from one turbulence slice into a single value .",
    "ensemble averaging is then performed over many turbulence samples in order to become statistically relevant .",
    "the number of samples @xmath27 in one ensemble depends on the average spatial size of the density structures : if are very small compared to the vacuum wavelength , many of them exist in one turbulence slice resulting already in a good average .",
    "when , in contrast , the spatial dimensions of the density structures exceed @xmath7 and only very few of them exist in one turbulence slice , a high number of samples is required .",
    "note that according to eq .",
    "[ e.alpha ] , @xmath28 is always true and @xmath24 is therefore not expected to follow a normal distribution .",
    "the median and the interquartile range describing the range in which 50% of the data is located ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) are thus chosen to characterize this scatter parameter .",
    "for the second analysis method , the @xmath25 signals at the receiving antenna are averaged over one ensemble of density profiles .",
    "a gaussian is then fitted to the averaged signal and the beam size is determined and compared with the unperturbed beam .",
    "thus , a measure for an effective beam broadening is obtained .",
    "the beam width is an important parameter for the earlier mentioned case of a localized current drive : if the beam is too large compared to the width of the magnetic island it is supposed to stabilize , its impact on it is reduced  @xcite .",
    "the drawback of this method is , however , that side lobes due to strong scattering events are not taken into account .",
    "the quality of the ensemble average is controlled by determining the average position @xmath29 of the maximum in the @xmath25 signal in the detector antenna plane .",
    "this value is then compared with the position of the maximum signal @xmath30 for the homogeneous plasma .",
    "the difference of these two values is required to be zero within the errorbars : @xmath31    figure  [ f.spatial_dev_max ] shows the average of @xmath32 for the case of density structures having an average size of @xmath33 as a function of the ensemble size .",
    "the structure size @xmath34 is defined as the distance where the spatial auto - correlation drops to a value of @xmath35 . since the magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the simulation grid",

    "<S> it is not fully understood how electromagnetic waves propagate through plasma fluctuations when the size of the fluctuations is comparable with the wavelength of the incident radiation . in this paper , the perturbing effect of a turbulent plasma density layer on a traversing microwave beam is simulated with full - wave simulations . the deterioration of the microwave beam is calculated as a function of the characteristic turbulence structure size , the turbulence amplitude , the depth of the interaction zone and the size of the waist of the incident beam . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum scattering is observed for a structure size on the order of half the vacuum wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering and beam broadening was found to increase linearly with the depth of the turbulence layer and quadratically with the fluctuation strength . </S>",
    "<S> consequences for experiments and 3d effects are considered . </S>"
