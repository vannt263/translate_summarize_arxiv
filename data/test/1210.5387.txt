    "scattering experiments are amongst the most powerful tools to obtain information on the microscopic structure of matter . in solid state physics ,",
    "conventional elastic scattering of photons , electrons , and neutrons are the standard methods to study the precise spacing and the location of atoms in solids .",
    "one obtains this information by measuring the angular distribution of the diffracted particles which depends on the microscopic lattice structure of the studied solid . in conventional x - ray and electron diffraction experiments ,",
    "the incident particles interact with all the electrons in the sample and , since the majority of the electrons is located close to the nucleus , these experiments yield the averaged position of the atoms .",
    "the situation is very similar for neutron diffraction , for which scattering occurs from the nuclei directly .",
    "in addition to the sensitivity to the lattice structure , neutron and non - resonant x - rays also interact with the magnetic moments and therefore information on the magnetic structures in solids can be derived",
    ".    however , in many of the currently most intensively studied systems not only the behaviour of lattice and spins needs to be studied . also the charge and orbital degrees of freedom",
    "often play an essential role . in some materials a collective electronic ordering of spins , charges , and orbitals occurs which typically only affects a small fraction of the valence electrons .",
    "these phenomena can lead to novel exciting ground states .",
    "for instance , complex electronic phenomena involving the cooperative ordering of various electronic degrees of freedom are discussed intensively in relation with such outstanding phenomena like high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates@xcite or the colossal magneto - resistance in manganites@xcite .    as we will describe later on , charge and orbital orders are very difficult to observe with the aforementioned traditional scattering techniques .",
    "a new experimental probe , which enables to observe complex electronic order was therefore urgently needed .",
    "resonant ( elastic ) soft x - ray scattering ( rsxs ) provides exactly this : a highly sensitive probe for spacial modulations of spins , charges , and orbitals in complex materials .",
    "this unique sensitivity is achieved by merging diffraction and x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) into a single experiment , where the scattering part provides the information of spatial modulations and the xas part provides the sensitivity to the electronic structure .",
    "more precisely , rsxs close to an absorption edge involves virtual transitions from core levels into unoccupied states close to the fermi level and these virtual transitions depend strongly on the spin , charge and orbital configuration of the resonant scattering centers .",
    "the ordering of spins , charges , and orbitals typically results in electronic superlattices with periodicities of several nanometers , which matches very well with the wavelengths of soft x - rays lying between between @xmath0 6 to 0.6 nm corresponding to photon energies between @xmath0 200 ev to 2000 ev .",
    "moreover , since the virtual excitations in rsxs are related to specific core level excitations , the excitation energy of which changes from element to element , the method is element specific like xas .",
    "thus rsxs , different from magnetic neutron scattering can probe magnetic structures related to specific elements .",
    "the price paid for the unique sensitivity offered by rsxs is a very limited ewald sphere and a rather short photon penetration depth limiting studies to only the topmost 100 atomic layers or , depending on the resonance used , even less . but",
    "these limitations are very often compensated by the gain in sensitivity , which is extremely important when turning to magnetic and electronic properties of samples characterized by a very small amount of contributing material , i.e. , for studying thin films , nanostructures as well as surfaces and interfaces . as a consequence of the broken translational symmetry at the surface",
    ", nanosystems can show ordering phenomena which differ locally or macroscopically from those of the respective bulk systems , and even completely new phenomena can arise .",
    "for such systems , rsxs has been established as a very powerful and unique tool to study complex electronic ordering phenomena on a microscopic scale .",
    "the need for such studies has strongly increased within the last decade since the fabrication of high quality samples with macroscopic properties tunable by composition , strain , size and dimensionality has become possible , raising the hope for future multifunctional heterostructures characterized by so far unexpected and unexplored novel material properties and functionality .",
    "although rsxs offers many important ingredients to study condensed matter , it has only recently developed its full power .",
    "the reason for this is that intense soft x - ray sources with tunable energy only became available with the advent of 2nd and 3rd generation synchrotron radiation facilities .",
    "furthermore those soft x - rays are absorbed in air and therefore the diffraction stations have to operate in vacuum , which poses another complication and made the development of rsxs challenging . finally ,",
    "as mentioned above , the penetration depth into the solids is of the order of nanometers which means that surface effects may become important .",
    "thus in many surface sensitive systems the surfaces should be prepared under ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) conditions or at least should be kept under uhv during the measurements .",
    "this review covers the recent progress in rsxs and gives a survey of the application of the technique .",
    "after the introduction , the principles of rsxs are presented , followed by a description of the experimental development . the main part is then devoted to the application of rsxs in the study of magnetic structures , charge order , and orbital order in thin layers , artificial structures , interfaces , and correlated systems .",
    "the review concludes with a summary and an outlook .",
    "elastic resonant x - ray scattering combines x - ray spectroscopy and x - ray diffraction in one single experiment . roughly speaking , x - rax diffraction provides the information about the spatial order ,",
    "while the spectroscopic part provides the sensitivity to the electronic states involved in the ordering .",
    "a first qualitative understanding of this strongly enhanced sensitivity to electronic order can be gleaned from the schematic illustration of the resonant scattering process shown in figure[fig : rsxs_scheme ] : the incoming photon virtually excites a core electron into the unoccupied states close to the fermi level , thereby creating the so - called intermediate state @xmath1 of the resonant scattering process .",
    "this virtual transition depends very strongly on the properties of the valence shell and , therefore , results in the tremendously enhanced sensitivity of resonant x - ray scattering to electronic ordering .",
    "the state @xmath1 then decays back into the ground state @xmath2 and a photon with the same energy as the incoming one is re - emitted .",
    "this combination of spectroscopy and diffraction will be described in the following .          in this section ,  aspects of the diffraction of x - rays by a crystal will be summarized . for more detailed and extensive descriptions of this topic the reader",
    "is referred to the literature@xcite .       +   + in the following we will consider a crystal that is formed by a perfectly periodic arrangement of lattice sites , which act as scattering centers for the incident x - ray field .",
    "the scattering from site @xmath3 in the crystal is described in terms of a scattering length @xmath4 , which is also called the form factor , and can be represented as@xcite @xmath5 the first two terms @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the non - resonant charge and magnetic scattering , respectively , where the scattering described by @xmath6 , which is proportional to the total number of electrons of the scatterer , is called thomson scattering .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the so - called dispersion correction , which is not only a function of the photon energy @xmath9 , but also of the polarisation of the incoming ( @xmath10 ) and scattered beam ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this correction becomes very important close to absorption edges and describes the resonant scattering processes illustrated in figure[fig : rsxs_scheme ] .     and",
    "@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the whole crystal can be described by discrete translations of the unit cell with its basis .",
    "the relative phase of x - rays scattered by the two sites of the basis is @xmath13 ( right panel).,width=283 ]    physically the scattering length @xmath4 describes the change in amplitude and phase suffered by the incident wave during the scattering process : a scatterer with scattering length @xmath4 exposed to an incident plane wave @xmath14 causes a scattered radial wave @xmath15 , which , far away from the scattering center , can be approximated by a plane wave .    in order to calculate the intensity of the total scattered wave field with wave vector @xmath16 , all the radial waves have to be summed with the correct relative phases . as illustrated in figure[fig : scatter_scheme ] , the geometric relative phase of two scatterers is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the scattering vector and @xmath19 is the difference in position .",
    "the total intensity detected in a distant detector is therefore    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the vector pointing to the origin of unit cell @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the position of the scatterer @xmath4 measured from that origin .",
    "@xmath24 is called the unit cell structure factor and describes the interference of the waves scattered from the different sites within a unit cell .",
    "the lattice sum @xmath25 is due to the interference of the scattering from the different unit cells at @xmath21 .",
    "its @xmath26-dependence therefore provides information about the number of sites scattering coherently , i.e. , it is related to the correlation length of the studied order . for an infinite number of coherently scattering unit cells , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 represents the reciprocal lattice .",
    "this corresponds to the well - known laue condition , which states that a reflection can only be observed if @xmath29 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the treatment described above is known as the kinematic approximation .",
    "this approximation is valid as long as the intensity of the scattered wave is much weaker than that of the incidence wave , which means that the interaction between the incoming and outgoing waves or multiple scattering events can be neglected .",
    "since in resonant x - ray diffraction experiments one usually deals with weak superlattice reflections , this approximation is valid in most cases .",
    "if , however , the scattered wave becomes too strong , then one has to resort to the so - called dynamical theory of diffraction .",
    "this description will not be presented here and the interested reader is referred to the literature@xcite .     and @xmath16 , is vertical in this example . incoming and outgoing polarisations are denoted as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , where @xmath32 indicates a polarisation perpendicular to the scattering plane and @xmath33 refers to a polarisation parallel to the scattering plane .",

    "an incoming photon beam with defined wave vector @xmath35 impinges on the sample and is scattered elastically into the direction defined by @xmath16 , corresponding to a scattering vector @xmath18 . in the so - called specular geometry",
    "the incoming and the outgoing beam are at an angle @xmath36 with the sample surface . in this case",
    ", the scattering angle between @xmath35 and @xmath35 is @xmath37 .",
    "the wave vectors of the incident and scattered beam define the scattering plane , which is vertical in the present example .",
    "polarisation directions parallel or perpendicular to this scattering plane are referred to as @xmath33- and @xmath32-polarisation , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , the incoming and outgoing polarisations in figure[fig : exp_scheme ] are denoted as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "an important aspect of resonant x - ray scattering is given by the polarisation dependence of @xmath38 at resonance .",
    "this can cause the polarisation of the outgoing beam to be different from that of the incoming beam .",
    "a typical example , which is frequently encountered in resonant scattering experiments , is a change of the incoming polarisation from @xmath39 to an outgoing polarisation @xmath40 ; so - called @xmath41-scattering .",
    "such changes in the polarisation contain important information about the symmetry of the studied order , as will be discussed in more detail later on .",
    "controlling both the incoming and the outgoing polarisation can therefore be a big advantage .",
    "the incoming polarisation can be routinely controlled by modern insertion devices like elliptical undulators .",
    "the determination of the outgoing polarisation in rsxs is currently less common , but can be achieved using a polarisation analyzer as sketched in figure[fig : exp_scheme ] . by switching between the two configurations shown in the figure , for example",
    ", it is possible to observe either the @xmath40- or the @xmath42-component of the scattered beam .    in the following discussion of the various case studies",
    ", a number of different scan - types will be described , which we will introduce briefly here :    * radial scan or @xmath43 scan .",
    "this is a scan along the direction defined by the scattering vector @xmath44 , which therefore provides information about the correlations along @xmath44 . in practice",
    "this scan is done by rotating the sample and the detector in steps of @xmath45 and @xmath46 about @xmath47 , respectively , which is equivalent to changing @xmath36 of the incoming and outgoing beam by the same amount . *",
    "transverse scan .",
    "this is a scan perpendicular to the direction defined by @xmath44 .",
    "it hence contains information about correlation in the plane perpendicular to @xmath44 , but is also often affected by the sample mosaic .",
    "a transverse scan can be done by rotating the sample about @xmath48 or @xmath47 , while keeping the detector position fixed .",
    "* azimuth scan .",
    "this is another way of investigating the polarisation dependence of the resonant scattering . in this type of scan ,",
    "the resonant scattered intensity is recorded while rotating the sample by an angle @xmath49 about the scattering vector @xmath44 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : exp_scheme ] ) .",
    "azimuthal scans will be described in more detail in sec.[sec : pol_dep ] . *",
    "energy scan . here",
    "the photon energy dependence of a given reflection at @xmath44 is measured . in many cases",
    "this measurement is performed by scanning the photon energy , while recording the scattered intensity at @xmath18 . since both @xmath35 and @xmath16 change with the photon energy ,",
    "this means that for each photon energy the scattering geometry has to be adjusted such as to keep @xmath44 constant .      in the following sections[sec : lightmatter]-[sec : rsxsandxas ] the resonant scattering length and its relation to x - ray absorption will be described in a rather formal way .",
    "readers who are mainly interested in the application of the method , can skip this theoretical part and continue with sec.[sec : hannon ] .",
    "readers who would like to learn more about the theoretical description of the interaction between light and matter can find a very nice treatment with more details in ref.@xcite .",
    "+   + in general , the scattering of photons caused by matter is due to the interactions between the electromagnetic wave and the particles in a solid . in the present case",
    "only the interactions between the electromagnetic wave and the electrons in a solid are important .",

    "we will only briefly discuss the origin of this relation .",
    "readers interested in the detailed derivation are referred to the literature@xcite .",
    "the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath100 is essentially given by the fact that the transmission of a beam through a plate of some material can be described in two equivalent ways : ( i ) behind the plate there will be an additional phase shift that was suffered by the wave during the passage through the material of the plate . at normal incidence , this phase shift is simply given by @xmath145 , where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the the wave vector of the light and the thickness of the plate , respectively .",
    "( ii ) the plate can also be considered as a set of scatterers , which cause an additional scattered wave behind the plate .",
    "the total wave field behind the plate is therefore a superposition of the incident wave and the scattered wave , where the latter is related to the scattering length @xmath100 of the scatterers within the plate .",
    "only identical scattering centers are assumed . since both descriptions must give the same result for the wave field behind the plate one can deduce that @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the number density of the material .",

    "+   + the general expressions derived in the previous sections are useful to understand the general process of resonant diffraction . however , for the analysis of experimental data it is necessary to evaluate @xmath103 for a specific situation .",
    "the simplest case for which explicit expressions can be derived , is the one of a free atom with a magnetic moment . in this situation",

    "these factors depend on the products @xmath157 appearing in eq.[eqn : fdipole ] and define the strength of the resonant scattering .",
    "there are 3 different terms in eq.[eqn : hannon ] : the first term does not depend on the spin direction and corresponds to non - magnetic resonant scattering .",
    "this term simply adds to the thomson scattering in eqs.[eq : f_general ] and [ kheqn ] , which has the same polarisation dependence .",
    "the second term is proportional to @xmath158 and is linear in @xmath154 and therefore describes magnetic resonant scattering . by virtue of the optical theorem this part of @xmath103 can be related to the x - ray magnetic circular dichroism in absorption@xcite .",
    "the third term is proportional to @xmath159 , i.e. , this term is quadratic in @xmath154 and hence also corresponds to resonant magnetic x - ray scattering .",

    "this polarisation dependence is not captured by eq.[eqn : hannon ] , because in the non - magnetic case , this formula implies @xmath161 , which is isotropic and the same for all @xmath162 .    in",
    "the following we will provide a simplified description of the effects described by carra and thole@xcite , and by haverkort@xcite . in particular , we will restrict ourselves to the dipole approximation and to magnetic scattering terms that are linear in the spin direction @xmath163 .",
    "this is sufficient to illustrate the effects of the local environment , but in general the higher order terms can be relevant as well . for the complete expressions including higher order terms in @xmath164 the reader",
    "is referred to ref.@xcite .    in the most general case of a magnetic site in a low symmetry environment , the tensor @xmath165 ( cf .",
    "[ sec : dipoleapprox ] ) , describing the polarisation and energy dependence of the resonant scattering has the form : @xmath166 with complex energy dependent matrix elements @xmath167 .",
    "however , depending on the local point group symmetry of the scatterer , this tensor can be simplified and especially in high symmetries the simplifications are significant : in the extreme case of a free non - magnetic atom with spherical symmetry one has @xmath168 with the identity matrix @xmath169 .",
    "if the spherical symmetry is broken only by the spin moment of the scatterer , the first two terms of eq.[eqn : hannon ] translate to @xmath170    it is this expression that is very often used for the analysis of resonant x - ray scattering data .",
    "it is important to know in which situations this approximate expression can be used and in which situation it yields wrong results .",
    "we therefore discuss two other cases to clarify this point .",
    "first , we consider a local environment of @xmath171-symmetry .",
    "in this situation @xmath112 can be expressed as @xmath172    comparing eqs.[eqn : fsph ] and [ eqn : foh ] it can be seen , that the spherical approximation may still be used , as long as the magnetic term linear in @xmath164 dominates the resonant scattering signal .",
    "we mention that already for @xmath171-symmetry the terms quadratic in @xmath164 differ from eq.[eqn : hannon ] . as a second example we consider a local @xmath173 symmetry . depending on the deviation from @xmath171 ,",
    "the resonant scattering length can now deviate significantly from the spherical approximation :    @xmath174    as can be seen in the above equation , the energy dependence of the magnetic resonant scattering now depends on the spin direction , i.e. , depending on the direction of @xmath164 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 contribute with different weights .",
    "this effect is therefore given by the difference between @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "it is also important to note that even the non - magnetic scattering in eq.[eqn : fd4h ] is no longer isotropic .",
    "this means that for local symmetries lower than cubic the non - magnetic resonant scattering also becomes polarisation dependent , in agreement with the qualitative arguments given in the beginning of this section .",
    "we already mentioned that the polarisation dependence of resonant x - ray scattering provides important information about the symmetry of the studied ordering . in this section",
    "we will provide a simple example for this , namely the resonant magnetic scattering of a bcc antiferromagnet . in this case",
    "the polarisation dependence of the resonant scattering allows one to determine the directions of the ordered moment .       +   + before we discuss our example , it is useful to introduce an efficient way to describe polarisation dependent resonant scattering .",
    "the resonant scattering length as a function of the incoming and outgoing polarisation can be expressed , using a @xmath177 scattering matrix @xmath178@xcite :    @xmath179    the matrix elements of @xmath180 therefore correspond to @xmath181- , @xmath41- , @xmath182- and @xmath183-scattering of lattice site @xmath3 . using these @xmath180 ,",
    "the corresponding structure factor matrix @xmath184 can be calculated according to eq.[eq : kinematic ] : @xmath185 .",

    "+   + in order to illustrate the polarisation dependence of resonant magnetic x - ray scattering , we consider the example of a bcc antiferromagnet .",
    "the unit cell contains two inequivalent lattice sites : one at @xmath191 with @xmath192 and one at @xmath193 with @xmath194 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that the two lattice sites differ only in the local spin moment and are identical otherwise .",
    "note that the above coordinates refer to the so - called crystal frame , which is defined by the crystal axes .",
    "we will consider the ( 001)-reflection for which @xmath195 . since the system is cubic and only the terms linear in @xmath196 contribute to resonant @xmath197",
    ", we can use the expression given in eq.[eqn : foh ] which is proportional to @xmath198 , i.e. , the @xmath199 are simply given by the term proportional to @xmath200 in eq.[eqn : soh ] .",
    "this then yields :    @xmath201    in this equation @xmath49 is the azimuthal angle and describes a rotation of the sample about @xmath202 as indicated in figure[fig : exp_scheme ] .",
    "when the sample is rotated about @xmath202 , the crystal frame and with it the spin directions rotate within the @xmath203-plane . in the current setting the spin directions are along @xmath47 for @xmath204 .",
    "the square modulus of the matrix elements of @xmath184 is proportional to the intensities in the different scattering channels .",
    "for instance , the intensities in the @xmath41- and the @xmath183-channels are @xmath205 and @xmath206 , respectively .",
    "the calculated azimuth - dependences for @xmath207 and @xmath208 are shown in the top panel figure[fig : azi ] .",
    "the azimuthal dependence of @xmath207 is due to the fact that @xmath209 , i.e. , this intensity is maximal if the spin directions are parallel to the scattering plane .",
    "similarly , it is easy to see that @xmath210 , which means that @xmath208 maximal for spins aligned perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "figure[fig : azi ] also shows the azimuthal dependences of @xmath207 and @xmath208 for spins along @xmath211 .",
    "it can be seen that the azimuthal dependence changes drastically with the inclination angle @xmath212 between @xmath213 and @xmath154 .    in this simple example of a cubic antiferromagnetic system",
    ", the polarisation dependence of the resonant scattering provides a powerful means to identify magnetic scattering and to determine spin - directions : ( i ) in a cubic system , the observation of @xmath41-scattering directly implies magnetic scattering .",
    "( ii ) analyzing the azimuthal dependences enables to determine the direction of the spins .",
    "however , great care must be taken when dealing with non - cubic systems . in this case , @xmath41-scattering no longer unambiguously identifies magnetic scattering .",
    "a very prominent example is the orbitally ordered and magnetically disordered phase of lamno@xmath139 , where the @xmath41-scattering is caused by orbital ordering and not by spin order@xcite .",
    "the @xmath41-scattering in this case is related to the polarisation dependence of the first term in eq.[eqn : fd4h ] . in materials with low local symmetries ,",
    "the analysis of the azimuthal dependences is also more involved and the cubic approximation might lead to wrong results@xcite .",
    "one of the most outstanding properties of resonant x - ray diffraction is its greatly enhanced sensitivity to electronic ordering phenomena .",
    "this sensitivity is a spectroscopic effect , which is related to the resonance factors @xmath214 of the resonant scattering length .",
    "it should be noted , however , that resonant scattering involves transitions into unoccupied states , i.e. , these experiments probe modulations of the unoccupied states close to the fermi level . besides the high sensitivity",
    ", the inherent element selectivity is a second advantage of resonant x - ray scattering : by tuning the photon energy to a specific absorption edge , the scattering is usually dominated solely by the scatterers at resonance .    in the following",
    "we very briefly summarize some of the main spectroscopic effects at the o @xmath215 , the tm @xmath216 and the re @xmath217 edges , which will be relevant for the results presented in section[sec : casestudies ] .",
    "a much more complete account of spectroscopic effects in core - level spectroscopies , including the core - levels described below , can be found in @xcite .       +   + in the tm oxides the o @xmath218 states play an important role in the chemical bonding .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to investigate their role for electronic ordering phenomena . by performing a scattering experiment at the o @xmath215 edge ,",
    "the scattering process involves @xmath219 transitions , i.e. , virtual excitations directly into the @xmath218 valence shell . in this way , the resonant scattering at the o @xmath215 edge becomes very sensitive to spatial modulations of the o @xmath218 states .",
    "there is no spin - orbit interaction of the @xmath220 core - hole and the spin - orbit interaction is usually weak in the @xmath218 final state also .",
    "resonant scattering at the o @xmath215 edge is therefore typically rather insensitive towards the ordering of spin moments .",
    "however , the hybridisation of the o @xmath218 levels with the tm @xmath221 states can induce magnetic sensitivity also here as discussed in section[sec : multiferroics ] .",
    "in addition to this , and in contrast to the tm @xmath216 and re @xmath217 edges described below , the @xmath220 core hole does not produce a strong multiplet splitting in the intermediate state .",
    "up to date a number of experiments on different materials , including the cuprates and the manganites , have demonstrated a strong resonant enhancement of superlattice reflections at the o @xmath215 edge , revealing the active role of the oxygen @xmath218 states in the electronic order ( cf .",
    "section[sec : chargeorder ] ) .",
    "nearly all the resonances observed so far are peaked at the low - energy side of the oxygen @xmath215 edge , showing that the probed electronic modulations mainly involve the electronic states close to the fermi level .       +   + at the transition metal @xmath216 edges the resonant scattering process involves @xmath223 transitions .",
    "this makes it possible to study ordering phenomena related to the @xmath221 valence states of the tm .",
    "the strong spin - orbit interaction of the @xmath218 core - hole splits the x - ray absorption spectra into the so - called @xmath224 edge at lower energies ( @xmath225 core hole ) and the @xmath226 edge at higher energies ( @xmath227 core hole ) .",
    "this is shown for the cu @xmath216-edge in figure[fig : kkanalysis ] .",
    "furthermore , the coupling of the @xmath218 core - hole with a partially filled @xmath221-shell in the intermediate state , results in a very pronounced multiplet structure of the @xmath216 edges not only in absorption , but also in resonant scattering , as can be inferred from the optical theorem .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction causes a greatly enhanced sensitivity towards spin - order@xcite , which , by means of the optical theorem , is directly related to the magnetic circular and linear dichroism in absorption@xcite .",
    "rsxs at the tm @xmath216 edges therefore allows the study of magnetic order of the tm - sites .",
    "in addition other electronic degrees of freedom of the @xmath221 electrons , like orbital and charge can be probed at these edges in a very direct way , since the virtual transitions depend directly on the configuration of the @xmath221 shell .",
    "+   + as will be described in detail in section[sec : magneticstructureofthinfilms ] , rsxs at the re @xmath217 edges plays an important role in determining the magnetic structure of thin films containing res . at the re @xmath217 edge ,",
    "the resonant scattering process involves @xmath228 transitions .",
    "one therefore probes the @xmath229 states of the re elements , which play the most important role for their magnetism .    in the @xmath230 final state of xas",
    "there is a strong spin - orbit coupling that splits the absorption edge into the @xmath231 edge at lower energies ( @xmath232 core hole ) and the @xmath233 edge at higher energies ( @xmath234 core hole ) .",
    "furthermore , the coupling between the core - hole and the valence shell , and the spin - orbit interaction acting on the 4f - electrons , causes a multiplet structure .",
    "both the @xmath217 splitting and the multiplet structure are also reflected in rsxs as dictated by the optical theorem .",
    "similar to the case of the tm @xmath216 edge , the spin - orbit splitting in the intermediate state of the rsxs process again results a greatly enhanced magnetic sensitivity , which enables the study of the magnetic order in extremely small sample volumes .",
    "a particular feature of the re spectra is the small crystal field splitting .",
    "hence , the spectral shape at the @xmath217 resonances is largely determined by the atomic multiplet structure independent of the crystal symmetry .",
    "effects of the local symmetry , as discussed in section[sec : haverkort ] are therefore not so pronounced as in case of @xmath221 tm , which permits an interpretation of rsxs data without recourse to detailed multiplet calculations@xcite .",
    "rsxs experiments require photon energies in the range between 200 ev and 2000 ev and substantially benefit from a control of the incident light polarisation , in particular linear in the scattering plane as well as in the perpendicular direction ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 in figure[fig : exp_scheme ] ) .",
    "but also circular polarisation is important , as will be discussed in connection with cycloidal magnetic structures in section[sec : multiferroics ] .",
    "these conditions are met by a number of beamlines at third - generation synchrotron radiation sources worldwide .",

    "must therefore be designed as vacuum instruments , while permitting scattering geometries as shown in figure[fig : exp_scheme ] . for many applications , even ultra - high vacuum ( uhv )",
    "conditions are preferred , because the x - ray absorption length in the materials studied can be as short as 200 in the vicinity of soft x - ray resonances@xcite , rendering the method quite surface sensitive at small scattering angles .",
    "therefore , cleanliness of the sample surface can become an issue , and particularly thin - film reflectivities at low temperatures will be modified by growing overlayers due to gas absorption .",
    "while resonant diffraction using hard x - rays could make use of conventional diffractometers , instrumentation for soft x - ray diffraction therefore has only recently become available .",

    ", rsxs has been shown to be a very sensitive tool to study such interfaces since its huge charge and magnetic scattering strength is accompanied by a moderate penetration depth , element specificity and access to structural information .",
    "one crucial parameter that can influence interface - generated functionality is chemical and/or magnetic roughness , which for a buried interface can be characterized best by scattering techniques measuring the related off - specular scattered intensity distributions .",
    "such diffuse scattering contributions , however , are typically several orders of intensity weaker than the specular reflectivity and require an extraordinary magnetic scattering strength to be detectable .    the first demonstration of how diffuse rsxs intensities can be exploited to track magnetic roughness was reported by mckay et al .",

    "study the diffuse intensity around the specular reflectivity was measured at the co @xmath224 resonance containing contributions from magnetic and chemical roughness . in order to separate the two quantities ,",
    "the intensity was measured with circular polarised x - rays for two opposite magnetizations of the sample . in this case",
    "the sum of the two measurements represents the chemical roughness while the difference was interpreted as a measure of the magnetic roughness . from the intensity and width of such broad intensity distributions ,",
    "properties like the root mean square roughness ( intensity ) and correlation lengths ( width ) can be extracted independently for the magnetic and the chemical interface .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic signal drops much faster with increasing momentum transfer @xmath288 than the chemical intensity as can be seen in figure[p_mckay96 ] .",
    "this observation yields a surprising result , namely a much smoother magnetic interface if compared with the chemical roughness .",
    "it was explained by a weaker coupling of the co moments in the intermixing region compared to that of the homogeneous part of the film .",
    "this means that the moments connected with chemical roughness do not contribute to the signal from the film magnetization and the magnetic interface therefore appears smoother than the chemical one .",
    "similar results have been obtained by freeland at al . who studied systematically the relation between magnetic and chemical interfacial roughness by monitoring the diffuse scattering from a series of cofe alloy films with varying chemical roughness@xcite . here",
    ", it was also shown that the diffuse intensity can be used to measure magnetic hysteresis loops of bulk and interfacial magnetization independently @xcite .",

    "the observation of different roughnesses of the chemical and magnetic interfaces shows that the understanding of macroscopic magnetic phenomena and their relation to roughness can not be simply obtained from the knowledge of the chemical roughness alone .",

    "the proximity of two different magnetic systems can cause more complex changes of the magnetic properties than just introducing disorder , as discussed in the previous paragraphs .",
    "a prominent example , connected with functionality already applied in technological applications is the exchange bias effect .",
    "exchange bias is the observation of a shift of the hysteresis along the field axis of a fm material in contact with an antiferromagnet ( af ) after field - cooling through the nel temperature .",
    "the general mechanism was identified to be the exchange interaction between the spins of the fm and the af at the interface , which generates an additional unidirectional anisotropy for the fm spins @xcite . however , the original models assuming perfect interfaces failed to describe exchange bias and related phenomena in a quantitative way .",
    "rather , the exchange bias strongly depends on details of the magnetic structure at the interface . exploiting xmcd techniques , rich knowledge on the magnetic behaviour of the interface",
    "was obtained .",
    "in particular the presence of a fm component within the af including a pinned fraction that is related to the exchange bias was observed @xcite . due to the fact that interfaces are buried , techniques not limited to the top sample surface region are of advantageous .",
    "therefore , a large number of experiments exploited the xmcd on the specular reflectivity to characterize the element specific behaviour of spins in exchange bias systems @xcite .",
    "such studies revealed the complex magnetic situation at the interface connected with exchange bias .",
    "in particular , several different types of spins are involved , namely the fm spins , the compensated afm moments as well as uncompensated afm moments that can be divided into a pinned and a rotatable fraction . by exploiting the structural information contained in reflectivity data , detailed characterization of the depth dependence of the different magnetic contributions at the interface could be achieved . by varying the absorption threshold , magnetization direction , photon polarisation and scattering geometry ,",
    "rsxs can be tuned to be sensitive to almost all the magnetic ingredients of the magnetic interface . in this way roy et al .",

    "analogous to the procedure outlined in section [ sec : rsxsandxas ] , the imaginary part of the form factor can be derived from x - ray absorption data and finally the real part can be derived via a kramers - kronig transformation . the form factor for that part which is related to doped holes",

    "since the scattered intensity is determined by the form factor squared , this also means that at resonance the scattered intensity of a hole is amplified by a factor of about 7000 .",
    "this fact demonstrates the enormous sensitivity of rsxs to the charge modulation of valence electrons which renders this method an ideal tool to study the charge modulation of doped holes in transition metal oxides .",

    "as outlined above , this value is expected for this doping concentration in a simple model in which three cu - o lines are not doped and the fourth line is 50% doped . the relatively small experimental value of 0.063 hole modulation can be explained by the fact that the holes are distributed among many different ( oxygen ) sites .    in figure[lbco_abba](b ) xas data at the cu @xmath224 edge together with a resonance profile is presented . here the enhancement of the scattering length was estimated to be about 300 .",

    "sample environment will play an important role in future rsxs experiments : the possibility to apply high magnetic fields and low temperatures to the sample will offer interesting studies on new ground states in correlated systems .",
    "furthermore , the development of intense coherent soft x - ray sources by the development of fourth generation synchrotron radiation facilities ( energy recovery linacs and free electron lasers ) will allow to reveal , element specific and with nanometer spacial resolution , complicated non - periodic lattice , magnetic , and charge structures . here",
    "important issues will be phenomena related to fluctuation near phase transitions , chemical reactions , defects and precipitations in materials etc .",
    "finally , with the advent of free - electron laser photon sources in the soft x - ray region , interesting time - dependent pump - probe studies on the structural evolution of photo - excited solids will be feasible on a large scale .",
    "possibly movies of chemical reactions , studies on matter under extreme conditions , watching magnetic spin flips in real time , and unraveling the functional dynamics of biological materials will be feasible .",
    "the future of rsxs will be not only related to bulk studies of the charge , orbital , and spin order in transition metal compounds . rather the focus will be also on similar studies in thin films , all kind of artificial nanostructures and in particular on the structure and the electronic properties of interfaces . therefore those rsxs experiments will strongly depend on the development of preparation stations for artificial nanostructures , e.g. by laser deposition or molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "one focus of future rsxs experiments will still be related to complex bulk properties of correlated materials as a function of composition , temperature , and magnetic field . there ,",
    "mainly charge , spin , and orbital ordering as well as jahn - teller distortions will be studied in correlated transition metal and rare earth compounds .",
    "new bulk experiments could be considered in the fields of vortex lattices of superconductors since the charge inside and outside of vortexes is different .",
    "since similar to the o @xmath215 edges in tm oxides , the c @xmath215 edges in soft matter are strongly dependent on the chemical bonding of c atoms , rsxs will develop to a great tool for investigations of nanoscale structures and spacial distributions in polymer blends , multiblock copolymers , polymer solutions , lipid membranes , colloids , micelles , and polymeric biological composite particles .",
    "furthermore , using coherent light sources , disordered systems will be studied applying speckle methods .",
    "finally rsxs will be extended to the time domain via setting up pump - probe experiments to study the dynamics of phase transitions .",
    "the other focus of future rsxs will be certainly related in the analysis of structural and electronic properties of artificial structures on the nanometer scale which have great promise for novel functionality . in particular ,",
    "rsxs will help to resolve the problem to characterize the electronic structure of oxide hetero - epitaxial devices in which , as already discussed above , at the interfaces between two band insulators metallicity and even superconductivity has been detected .",
    "at present it is not decided whether this observation is due to the polar nature of the layers or due to o vacancies .",
    "future rsxs experiments will certainly help to resolve open questions in this field .",
    "thus one can be confident that rsxs will have a great impact on a vast variety of scientific fields ranging from solid state physics across materials science and chemistry to biology and medicine .",

    "<S> resonant ( elastic ) soft x - ray scattering ( rsxs ) offers a unique element , site , and valence specific probe to study spatial modulations of charge , spin , and orbital degrees of freedom in solids on the nanoscopic length scale . </S>",
    "<S> it can not only be used to investigate single crystalline materials . </S>",
    "<S> this method also enables to examine electronic ordering phenomena in thin films and to zoom into electronic properties emerging at buried interfaces in artificial heterostructures . during the last 20 years </S>",
    "<S> , this technique , which combines x - ray scattering with x - ray absorption spectroscopy , has developed into a powerful probe to study electronic ordering phenomena in complex materials and furthermore delivers important information on the electronic structure of condensed matter . </S>",
    "<S> this review provides an introduction to the technique , covers the progress in experimental equipment , and gives a survey on recent rsxs studies of ordering in correlated electron systems and at interfaces .    </S>",
