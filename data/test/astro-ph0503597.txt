    "in the currently popular hierarchical picture of structure formation , galaxies are thought to be embedded in massive dark halos .",
    "these halos grow from density fluctuations in the early universe and initially contain baryons in a hot gaseous phase .",
    "this gas subsequently cools and some fraction eventually condenses into stars .",
    "much progress has been made in observationally delineating the global star formation history and the resulting build - up of stellar mass ( e.g. , madau et al .",
    "1998 , brinchmann & ellis 2000 ; dickinson et al . 2003",
    "; bundy , ellis & conselice 2005 ) . however , many of the physical details , particularly the roles played by feedback and cooling , essential for a full understanding of how galaxies form , remain uncertain . models ( e.g. , van den bosch 2002 ; abadi et al .",
    "2003 ) have great predictive power in this area but only by assuming presently - untested prescriptions for these effects .",
    "obtaining further insight into how such processes operate is thus an important next step not only in understanding galaxy evolution , but also in verifying the utility of popular models , as well as the hierarchical concept itself .",
    "one approach towards understanding this issue is to trace how the stellar mass in galaxies forms in tandem , or otherwise , with its dark mass .",
    "the first step in this direction began with studies of scaling relations between the measurable properties of disk galaxies , specifically the relation between luminosity and maximum rotational velocity ( tully & fisher 1977 ) .",
    "studies utilizing roughly a thousand spiral galaxies have revealed a tight correlation between absolute magnitude and the maximum rotational velocity for nearby galaxies ( haynes et al .",
    "1999 ) . the limited data at high redshift suggests the tf relation evolves only modestly , equivalent to at most 0.4 - 1 magnitudes of luminosity evolution to @xmath4 ( vogt et al .",
    "1997 ; ziegler et al . 2002 ; bohm et al .",
    "how the tully - fisher relation evolves with redshift is still controversial , although it appears that fainter disks evolve the most ( bohm et al . 2004 ) , and that selection effects are likely dominating the differences found between various studies .",
    "furthermore , it has been difficult for modelers to reproduce the tully - fisher relation to within 30% ( e.g. , cole et al .",
    "2000 ) , making it an important constraint on our understanding of the physics behind galaxy formation .",
    "unfortunately , any interpretation of the tf relation is complicated by the fact that both luminosity and virial mass might be evolving together .",
    "a more physically - motivated comparison would be between stellar and virial mass .",
    "not only does this relation break potential degeneracies in the tf technique , but it also samples more fundamental quantities . in this paper",
    "we begin this task by investigating the evolution in the fraction of the total mass that is in a stellar form .",
    "this can be accomplished with some uncertainty by contrasting the _ stellar mass _ of a galaxy with its _",
    "halo mass_. we selected disk galaxies for our initial study since these two quantities can be effectively probed observationally for these galaxies with various assumptions ( e.g. , van den bosch 2002 ; baugh et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "this paper presents the first study of the near - ir tf relation , as well as a comparison between stellar and halo masses , for 101 disk galaxies within the redshift range @xmath5 drawn mostly from the deep1 redshift survey ( vogt et al .",
    "our goal is to address several questions relating to the mass assembly history of disks .",
    "as our sample is not formally complete in any sense , we can not derive general conclusions concerning the history of _ all _ present - day disks .",
    "however , we can determine whether the disks selected from the deep1 survey in the sampled redshift range are still accreting matter and converting baryons into stellar disks at a significant rate .",
    "we construct stellar mass tully - fisher and stellar mass / halo mass relation for our sample and find that there is little evolution in either from @xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that the dark and stellar components of disk galaxies grow together during this time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  2 contains a description of the sample including the fields used and the different data products and a discussion on quality control . ",
    "3 describes how various quantities , such as the halo and stellar masses , are derived from the basic data .",
    " 4 presents our results and  5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we assume the following cosmology throughout this paper : h@xmath7 = 70 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 = 0.7 and @xmath10 = 0.3 .",
    "our sample consists of 101 galaxies , 93 of which are drawn from the deep1 survey ( see vogt et al .",
    "2004 ; simard et al . 2002 ; weiner et al .",
    "2004 ) , and 8 of which were obtained independently .",
    "each of these systems has a resolved rotation curve which was obtained with the keck telescope using lris ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) in the redshift range @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "the additional data presented in this paper , which enables stellar masses to be compared with virial masses , consists of near - infrared imaging described in @xmath132.2 .",
    "full details of the selection criteria for the galaxies are discussed in deep1 papers ( vogt et al . 1996 , 1997 , 2005 )",
    "to which the interested reader is referred . moreover , the necessary assumptions implicit in the derivation are detailed in those papers , to which we refer the reader .",
    "briefly , galaxies were selected morphologically as elongated disks in hubble space telescope ( hst ) f814w ( i@xmath14 ) images with i@xmath15 .",
    "the inferred inclination was chosen to be greater than 30to facilitate a measurement of the rotational velocity .",
    "the optical images used for both photometric and morphological analyses come from hst wide field planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 ) observations of the groth strip ( groth et al .",
    "1994 ; vogt et al .",

    "using i@xmath14 images , structural parameters were determined for each galaxy using the gim2d and galfit packages ( simard et al .",
    "2002 ; peng et al .",

    "were determined .",
    "the uncertainties in the r@xmath16 values determined through this method are possibly underestimated , as has been explored through careful 2-d fitting ( e.g. jong et al 1996 ) . to be inclusive of possible effects , we will incorporate an additional 30% uncertainty for our overall error on the measured values of @xmath18 .",
    "details of the observations , reductions and extraction of maximal rotational velocities @xmath19 from the lris spectroscopy are presented in vogt et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 , 2005 ) .",
    "briefly , each disk galaxy was observed along its major axis , as determined from the hst images ( simard et al .",
    "the maximum velocity , @xmath19 , is determined by fitting a fixed form for the rotation curve scaled according to the i@xmath14 disk scale length @xmath18 .",
    "the assumed rotation curve has a linear form which rises to a maximum at 1.5@xmath20 r@xmath21 , and remains flat at larger radii .",
    "our assumption that 1.5@xmath20 r@xmath16 is the radius where the rotation curves for disks reach their maximum is reasonable , based on a similar behavior for local disk systems of similar magnitudes ( persic & salucci 1991 ; sofue & rubin 2001 ) .",
    "our rotation curves are also visible out to several scale lengths , or roughly 2 - 5 ( e.g. , vogt et al .",
    "1997 ) , adequate for measuring v@xmath22 .",
    "this model form is then convolved with a seeing profile that simulates the conditions under which the observations were taken , and v@xmath23 is determined by iterative fitting .",
    "effects from the width of the slit , slit misalignment with the major axis , and varying inclination were taken into account when performing these fits , and calculating the resulting errors .",
    "typically , @xmath19 is determined to a precision of 10 - 20% due to these various sources ( e.g. , vogt et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the new data we present in this paper consist of deep near - infrared observations of the deep1 extended sample .",
    "precision near - infrared photometry is the critical ingredient for determining stellar masses for our sample ( brinchmann & ellis 2000 ) .",
    "photometry was acquired with a @xmath24 filter with three different instruments : the keck near infrared camera ( nirc , matthews & soifer 1994 ) , the ukirt fast - track imager ( ufti , roche et al . 2003 ) , and the cooled infrared spectrograph and camera for ohs ( cisco , motohara et al .",
    "2002 ) on the subaru 8.4 meter telescope ( see bundy et al . 2004 for a more detailed description of these data ) .",

    "the cisco camera has a field of view of 108with a pixel scale of 0.105  pixel@xmath8 .",
    "the typical depths for these images is @xmath25 = 20.5 - 21 ( vega ) with a typical seeing of @xmath26 0.8 .    in each case , the infrared data were taken with a dither pattern whose step size exceeded the typical size of the galaxies of interest .",
    "the data were reduced by creating sky and flat - field images from sets of disregistered neighboring science frames .",
    "standard stars were observed for calibration purposes during the observations .",
    "some images taken in good seeing but through thin cloud were subsequently calibrated in photometric conditions via shallower exposures taken with the wide field infrared camera ( wirc , wilson et al . 2003 ) on the hale 5 meter telescope .",
    "we measure our photometry in the @xmath25-band , and hst i@xmath14 and v@xmath27 bands , within a scale - length factor , either 1.5r@xmath16 or 3r@xmath16 , both of which are generally large enough to avoid seeing effects from the @xmath24 imaging .",
    "we then extrapolate the total magnitudes , within each band , out to infinite radius by using the fitted parameters for an exponential disk derived in the hst i@xmath14 band . to compare observables over a range in redshift ,",
    "it is necessary to reduce all measures to a standard rest - frame .",
    "galactic extinction corrections were applied using the formalism of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) and internal extinction was accounted for according to measured inclinations and luminosities using the precepts of tully et al .",
    "it is debatable whether internal extinction corrections derived for nearby spirals are applicable to higher redshift disks .",
    "our sample is mostly composed of systems with m@xmath28 where extinction could be a cause for concern .",
    "however , direct extinction measurements in moderate redshift disks , determined through overlapping pairs , find a modest overall extinction ( white , keel & conselice 2000 ) .    to derive absolute magnitudes and rest - frame colors , we estimated non - evolutionary @xmath29-corrections .",
    "the k - band @xmath29-corrections were computed from spectral energy distributions determined alongside the stellar mass fits .",
    "we experimented with both the original algorithm developed by brinchmann & ellis ( 2000 ) and also an independent one developed by bundy , ellis & conselice ( 2005 , see @xmath133.2 ) .",
    "both methods agree very well .",
    "the approach is similar to that used by vogt et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) where @xmath29-corrections were calculated from model seds from gronwall & koo ( 1995 ) based on various star formation histories in the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) code .",
    "we also note that our derived k - correction values are very similar to non - evolutionary @xmath29-corrections derived by poggianti ( 1997 ) using seds from poggianti & barbaro ( 1996 ) .",
    "the virial mass of a galaxy - that is , the combined total of the dark , stellar and gaseous components - is perhaps its most fundamental property .",
    "however , obtaining an accurate estimate from observed quantities is necessarily difficult since there is no _ a priori _ agreed model for the relative distributions of the various components .",
    "our approach to this challenge will be to use both analytical techniques and semi - analytical simulations to investigate the relationship between the total halo mass and our dynamical and structural observables . although necessarily approximate and debatable in terms of the assumptions made , we will attempt , where possible , to investigate the uncertainties involved by contrasting the two approaches in the context of our data .    for a simple virialized system , such as a circularly rotating disk , we can place constraints on the total mass within a given radius @xmath30 independent of model assumptions .",
    "if @xmath31 , where we estimate the maximum rotational velocity v@xmath22 is reached , the mass within @xmath30 is given by ,    @xmath32    where @xmath31 .",
    "this assumes that the rotation curve reaches the maximum velocity by 1.5 @xmath20 r@xmath16 , ( persic & salucci 1991 ) , otherwise v@xmath22 should be replaced by v@xmath33 .",
    "there are a few possible approaches for determining total halo masses , some of which require the use of simulations to convert observed dynamical qualities , usually v@xmath22 , into halo masses .",
    "we take a basic approach using eq .",
    "( 1 ) to obtain the total mass with a given radius , and take a suitably large total radius of 100 kpc to measure the total halo mass .",
    "this is often the extent of disk hi rotation curves , and similar to the sizes of dark matter halos ( e.g. , sofue & rubin 2001 ) .",
    "another approach now being used ( e.g. , bohm et al . 2004 ) has been proposed by van den bosch ( 2002 ) . in this case , it is argued from analytic simulations of disk galaxy formation that the quantity @xmath34 gives , on average , the best empirical representation of the virial mass for simulated disks .",
    "the zero - point of the relationship between r@xmath16v@xmath35/g and virial mass is claimed to be independent of feedback and independent of the mass of the halo ( van den bosch 2002 ) .",
    "semi - analytic models based on @xmath36cdm ( e.g. , cole et al . 2000 ; benson et al .",
    "2002 ; baugh et al .",
    "2005 ) suggest , however , that the ratio between v@xmath37r@xmath16/g and halo mass is not as simple as the above formalism implies .",
    "the latest _ galform _ models from baugh et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and lacey ( priv .",
    "communication ) show that equation [ 1 ] and van den bosch ( 2002 ) under - predicts the dark halo mass .",
    "these models show that the relationship between the virial mass at r@xmath16 and the total halo mass changes as a function of mass in the sense that the ratio is higher for lower mass halos . physically this can be understood if high mass halos have a larger fraction of their baryonic mass in a hot gaseous phase that is not traced by the formed stellar mass .",
    "using the _ galform _ models to convert our observables into a total halo mass is however potentially inaccurate as these models can not reproduce the tully - fisher relation to better than 30% .",
    "however , there are reasons to believe that the semi - analytic models put the correct amount of halo mass into their modeled galaxies ( e.g. , benson et al .",
    "this however does not necessarily imply that the v@xmath22 values in these models are able to accurately match the halo masses .",
    "independent determinations of total halo masses are necessary to perform this test . however , the masses from this approach match within 0.5 dex the masses from using eq .",
    "( 1 ) with a suitably large total radius .    with these caveats in mind , we have used the _ galform _ model results to fit the relationship between the virial mass at r@xmath16 ( eq .",
    "1 ) , and the total mass of the halo ( m@xmath38 ) , a ratio which we call @xmath39 .",
    "we fit @xmath40 as a linear function of @xmath41 , such that @xmath42 . using the _ galform _ results we fit @xmath43 and @xmath44 at redshifts @xmath45 .",
    "we find that the functional form of @xmath40 does not change significantly with redshift , with typical values @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the value of the halo mass m@xmath38 is then given by :    @xmath48    observational and model uncertainties contribute to errors on these virial and halo mass estimates in two ways .",
    "measured scale lengths given by the gim2d and galfit fitting procedure (  2.1 ) , give an average error of 0.12 kpc , although we add an extra error to this to account for systematics seen when performing one component models to disks / bulge systems ( de jong 1996 ) . at the same time , systematic difficulties in the rotation curve analysis (  2.1 ) can arise .",
    "vogt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) discuss these issues in some detail and conclude the average error is @xmath49 kms@xmath8 ( typically @xmath5010 - 20% ) . following the discussion of rotation curve fitting in @xmath132.1 , it is possible we do not measure the true v@xmath22 required for insertion in equations ( 1 & 2 ) .",
    "even a modest underestimate of v@xmath22 would lead to a significant error in @xmath51 . in combination , these measurement uncertainties imply virial and halo masses precise to no better than 30% .",
    "the semi - analytic method for computing total halo masses is likely limited , and thus we also investigate the total halo masses found through the van den bosch ( 2002 ) formalism , and through the use of equation ( 1 ) out to 100 kpc .",

    "( 2 ) and van den bosch ( 2002 ) are all fairly similar",
    ". we account for these differences in our use of total halo masses in  4.3 .",
    "our procedure for deriving stellar masses follows the multi - color method introduced by brinchmann & ellis ( 2000 ) . combining hst v@xmath27 , i@xmath14 , and near - infrared @xmath24 photometry for a galaxy of known redshift",
    ", we fit a range of template seds synthesized using software by bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "our photometry is done in a matched aperture large enough to avoid seeing problems associated with the @xmath24-band .",
    "these fitted seds constrain the @xmath24-band mass / light ratio .",
    "our code for computing stellar masses only uses models with ages less than the age of the universe at the redshift observed . a @xmath52 analysis normalized by the near infrared @xmath24-band luminosity yields the stellar mass",
    ". the template seds were constructed sampling a range of exponentially - declining star formation rates , metallicities and ages with a salpeter imf .",
    "using other stellar mass functions , such as chabrier , kennicutt or kroupa would result in computed stellar masses that are smaller by @xmath53 0.3 dex .",
    "we further assumed a simple exponentially declining star formation history with @xmath54 values ranging from 0.001 - 15.0 gyr , and metallicities from z=0.005 - 5 in solar units .",
    "typical uncertainties in this method are a factor of three ( brinchmann & ellis 2000 ; papovich , dickinson & ferguson 2001 ; drory et al .",

    "the sed is constrained by the observed colors as measured in an aperture of radius 1.5 @xmath20 r@xmath16 in each band which is optimal in terms of signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",
    "we assume that there are no color gradients and use the colors measured within this aperture as the global color .",
    "the total @xmath24-band light is measured by extrapolating the 1.5 @xmath20 r@xmath16 flux to infinity , assuming the same exponential fit as measured in the hst i@xmath14 image .",
    "errors on the stellar masses arising from photometric uncertainties can be determined in a monte carlo fashion .",
    "simulated exponential disks of a known magnitude were inserted into the reduced hst and ground based images and photometrically recovered using the tools that were applied to the sample .",
    "the simulated disks were arranged to randomly sample the selected ranges of disk scale - length @xmath18 and inclination .",
    "the derived photometric errors were then input into the stellar mass calculations from which a @xmath55 range was calculated .",
    "the average error in m@xmath56 is 0.47 dex .",
    "the calculation of stellar masses through this technique is limited to a degree by systematics which are difficult to constrain with the current data set , with @xmath24-band magnitude errors only a small source of uncertainty .",
    "the models of the spectral evolution of galaxies depend both on the observed stellar libraries and underlying theory , and some fundamental uncertainties remain ( c.f .",
    "bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "we expect uncertainties of about 5 - 10% , given the range of possible models ( charlot , worthey & bressan 1996 ) .",
    "this is not important for the conclusions in this paper but might be an issue with larger and more accurate datasets in the future .",
    "we also can not constrain the amount of recent star formation produced in bursts ( e.g. , kauffmann et al . 2003 ; bell & de jong 2001 ) , resulting in a slight systematic overestimate of the stellar mass .",
    "the latter effect only becomes important at large burst fractions and should be @xmath57% for our big spirals ( c.f .",
    "drory et al 2003 ) .",
    "the final systematic uncertainty is the dust correction adopted .",
    "we use the calzetti ( 1997 ) extinction law in our stellar mass calculations , although other extinction laws produce very small differences ( at most 10 - 20% ) in the resulting stellar mass ( papovich et al .",
    "2001 ) . taken together",
    "we are likely to have systematic uncertainties in our stellar mass estimates amounting to @xmath58 dex which is lower than our random uncertainty , thus they will not influence our results .",
    "the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation has been the traditional method for investigating how dark halos and the stellar components of disk galaxies relate . the optical relation has been studied in disks galaxies out to redshifts @xmath4 by e.g. , vogt et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 , 2005 ) , ziegler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and bohm et al .",
    "these investigations have found between 0.4 and @xmath59 magnitudes of rest - frame b - band luminosity evolution in disks between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this luminosity evolution is derived by assuming that the slope of the tf relation at high redshift is the same as it is at @xmath60 .",
    "the question of differential evolution in the relation ( ziegler et al . 2002 ; bohm et al . 2004 ) , for example that the faintest galaxies evolve more rapidly , remains an important unknown .",
    "although the purpose of this paper is to move beyond the tf relation , we begin by plotting the k - band tf relation for our sample ( figure  1 ) .",
    "one might expect evolution of the tf relation in the k - band to display a clearer signal than the b - band since the effects of dust are mitigated and passive evolution should be more uniform in its effect across the sample .",
    "when we assume that the slope of the k - band tully - fisher is the same as the local value from verheijn ( 2001 ) we find no significant evolution , as is also found in the b - band ( vogt et al .",
    "we perform these fits using both a downhill simplex amoeba and levenberg - marquardt @xmath62 minimization , both of which give the same results .",
    "we find a fading of 0.04@xmath630.24 magnitudes for systems at @xmath64 compared with the @xmath60 relationship and a brightening of 0.37@xmath630.23 magnitudes for systems at @xmath65 , consistent with no evolution .",
    "the scatter does not evolve significantly ( 1.13 magnitudes for the @xmath660.7 sample , and 0.72 magnitudes for systems at @xmath64 ) .",
    "in all cases , the observed slope and scatter change only slightly when we ignore internal extinction corrections .",
    "although our results are broadly consistent with earlier , smaller samples , the interpretation of any evolutionary signal is complicated in two ways .",
    "first , only a limited range of luminosity and rotational velocity can be sampled at high redshift , leading to great uncertainties given the intrinsic scatter .",
    "second , as luminosity and rotational velocity are indirect measures of the assembly state of the galaxy , both may be evolving in complex ways , that mask actual evolutionary changes .",
    "the first step beyond the tf relation is to compare the stellar mass to the measured maximum velocity - a relation we will call the _ stellar mass - tully fisher relation_. the classical b - band tf relation scales such that @xmath67 .",
    "this coupling becomes even steeper for the local stellar mass tully - fisher relation in nearby disks , @xmath68 ( bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "ideally , we seek to measure the all - inclusive baryonic tf relation , but measuring the gas content of high redshift disks is not yet feasible .",
    "we can estimate how much cold gas we are missing in our stellar mass inventory by investigating the gas mass fractions for nearby disk galaxies . through examinations of the luminosities and hi masses for nearby disks , mcgaugh & de blok ( 1997 )",
    "conclude that galaxies which are massive , bright , red , or have a high - surface brightness , have very little gas in comparison to bluer , fainter , lower surface brightness systems .",
    "systems which are brighter than m@xmath69 have gas mass fractions that are typically 0.1 or lower . since our selection finds the most luminous , high surface brightness systems , which are also red , they are the least likely sub - class of disks to have a high gas content .    the stellar mass tf relation is shown in figure  2 where , as before , we divide the sample into two redshift bins , split at @xmath70 .",
    "each panel contains a solid line giving the @xmath60 best fit and a dashed line illustrating the @xmath63 3 @xmath71 uncertainty in this fit ( bell & de jong 2001 ) . as was the case for the conventional tf relations , no significant evolution in the zero - point",
    "is observed .",
    "the bell & de jong ( 2001 ) @xmath72 stellar mass tully - fisher relation can be written as m@xmath73 . by holding the slope of this relationship constant , we find that the zero point is best fit by 0.45@xmath630.12 at @xmath74 and 0.41@xmath630.13 at @xmath64 .",
    "neither of these are however significantly different from the @xmath60 relationship , and are very similar to each other .",
    "this implies that , if growth continues , the stellar and dark components are growing together .",
    "for example , if disk assembly since @xmath75 proceeded only by the addition of stellar mass at a uniform rate of 4 m@xmath76 year@xmath8 , the local zero point would be discrepant at the 4@xmath71 level .",
    "this lack of evolution is important for understanding how disk galaxy formation is occurring ( see  4.4 ) .",
    "moreover , the scatter in the stellar mass tully - fisher relation is similar to that observed in the k - band tully - fisher after converting the k - band magnitude scatter into a luminosity and assuming an average stellar mass to light ratio .",
    "the typical scatter ( in log m@xmath56 units ) in stellar mass for these is 0.65 for disks at @xmath74 and 0.48 for those at @xmath64 .",
    "the final step in our analysis will be an attempt to convert our measured quantities into a comparison of the stellar and halo masses as discussed in @xmath133 .",
    "recognizing the considerable uncertainties involved , figure 3 shows as a function of redshift the ratio , @xmath77 m@xmath56/m@xmath78 , between the stellar masses and virial masses ( eq .",
    "1 ) within 3r@xmath16 for our sample . as expected , the stellar masses are nearly always less than the independently - derived virial masses , indicating that our methods for computing these values are not dominated by large systematic errors .",

    "this indicates that within the visual parts of some of our sample , the disk component accounts for roughly all the mass , which is consistent with a maximal disk interpretation . however , there are clear examples on figure  3 where either the stellar mass is overestimated and/or the virial mass is underestimated .",
    "both of these are possibilities , since our stellar masses are potentially too high from using a salpeter imf , and we might be underestimating the value of v@xmath22 due to seeing , or a lack of depth in the lris observations . there is also a slight bias such that at higher redshifts nearly all galaxies sampled have high v@xmath22 values , which are likely maximal , while at lower redshifts we are sampling systems with lower v@xmath22 values , that have not yet fully formed their stellar masses .",
    "this is likely part of the reason that the stellar mass to virial mass ratio increases slight at higher redshifts .",
    "however , we are also interested in constraining the relationship between the total halo mass , m@xmath38 , and the total stellar mass m@xmath56 . as we discuss in",
    " 3 , it is very difficult to accurately obtain halo masses .",
    "we therefore show in figure  4 total halo masses derived through eq .",
    "( 1 ) at 100 kpc and through the semi - analytical approach ( eq .",
    "although we can not accurately determine total halo masses for individual systems , our main goal is to compare how the ratio of stellar to halo mass changes with redshift .",
    "figure  4 shows this relationship divided into the same redshift bins as in figures 1 & 2 .",
    "to first order , the halo masses and stellar masses of disk galaxies should correlate if star formation is regulated in the same manner in halos of different masses ( steinmetz & navarro 1999 ) .",
    "although there is no reason to expect any particular functional form between these two quantities , there is a reasonably well - fit linear relationship between them .",
    "we find that the zero point and slope of this relation does not change significantly between low and high redshift .",
    "there is also no obvious change in the scatter from high to low redshift ( 0.26 cf .",
    "the most significant outcome of figures 3 and 4 however is the remarkable similarity in trends found at high and low redshift suggesting some disks had completed the bulk of their stellar assembly by @xmath821 or more likely that the stellar and dark masses of galaxies grow together continuously .",
    "figure  5 shows the distribution of @xmath80 = m@xmath56/m@xmath38 for systems more massive than , and less massive than , the average halo mass , m@xmath83 .",
    "the solid line is the universal baryonic mass ratio .",
    "as mentioned earlier , most disk stellar mass fractions are lower than the cosmic ratio , which seems appropriate given our stellar mass inventory is not intended to account for all associated baryons .",
    "although some dispersion is expected , conceivably some fractions are overestimated or underestimated , for example by making incorrect assumptions about the imf , or underestimating v@xmath22 ( and hence m@xmath38 ) by insufficient sampling of the rotation curve .",
    "figure  5 also shows a tentative population of disk galaxies with remarkably low stellar fractions , the most extreme cases occurring in objects with halo masses m@xmath84 .",
    "these galaxies deviate from the @xmath72 stellar mass tf relation by more than 4 @xmath71 .",
    "investigation of the individual systems that lie in this category shows them to be undergoing vigorous star formation as inferred by bluer than average @xmath85 colors .",
    "a weak correlation was found between @xmath80 and @xmath85 . because these systems are blue , they may have kinematic asymmetries in their rotation curves which may raise their v@xmath22 values . however , this is unlikely the effect producing this slight correlation as most of the low @xmath80 systems also have low v@xmath22 values .",
    "we investigated several other possible correlations involving @xmath80 ( for example with the bulge / disk ratio ) but no significant trends were found .",
    "to investigate the implications of our results for the assembly history of stellar mass in disk galaxies since @xmath4 , we return to the behavior of the stellar fraction @xmath80 = m@xmath56(@xmath533r@xmath16)/m@xmath78(@xmath533r@xmath16 ) vs. redshift ( figure  3 ) , and the relationship between total stellar mass ( m@xmath56 ) and halo mass ( m@xmath38 ) at @xmath64 and @xmath74 ( figure 4 )",
    ". trends in these relations may shed light on the physical processes regulating star formation in disk galaxies .",
    "this is only the case however if the value of r@xmath16 for disks does not grow with time , which appears to be the case for the largest disks , based on our own limited data , and in statistical studies of @xmath86 disks ( ravindranath et al .",
    "2004 ; conselice et al .",
    "2004 ; cf .",
    "ferguson et al .",
    "2004 for higher redshifts ) .",
    "first , figure  3 shows that the median stellar vs. virial mass value for our sample does not change significantly with redshift .",
    "we can compare two simple extreme models to this result to determine the likely method by which disk galaxies are forming at @xmath3 . in a ` monolithic collapse ' model , where the dark halo and baryons for a galaxy are in place at high redshift , and there is no change in these mass components with time ( e.g. , eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ) ,",
    "the average value of m@xmath56/m@xmath78 should increase with time .",
    "this assumes that effective radii distribution for disks does not change with time , which is observed ( ravindranath et al .",
    "there is evolution in the monolithic model only in the sense that baryons are gradually converted to stars over time .",
    "this is the opposite to the observed trend in which the ratio of m@xmath56/m@xmath78 is roughly constant .",
    "on the other hand , in a hierarchical picture , the value of m@xmath56/m@xmath78 remains relatively constant with time .",
    "shown in figure  3 are model predictions from _ galform _ which show that the value of m@xmath56/m@xmath78 remains relatively constant with redshift .",
    "while we do not have a complete sample , we do find that the average and median values of m@xmath56/m@xmath78 for our sample remain constant with redshift within the errors , which is consistent with the hierarchical idea .",
    "the higher average m@xmath56/m@xmath78 value at @xmath86 is likely produced by our selection of the brightest disks at these redshifts ( vogt et al .",
    "the _ galform _ model however does not predict the full range of mass fractions that we find . at all redshifts",
    "there are systems dominated within r@xmath16 by their stellar masses , while some systems have low m@xmath56/m@xmath78 ratios .",
    "this is either produced by an observational bias (  4.3 ) , or the simulations predict too much dark matter in the centers of disks .",
    "figure  4 shows the relationship between total stellar and total halo masses ( see  3.1 ) for our sample , divided into our two redshift ranges .",
    "we also show on figure  4 the _ galform _ semi - analytic model values for this relationship for disk dominated galaxies with the 80% completeness indicated . as in figure  3 ,",
    "no strong evolution in m@xmath56/m@xmath38 ratios is predicted .",
    "as galaxies in the semi - analytic models grow by accreting smaller systems , or intergalactic gas coupled with dark matter , and then converting the newly - obtained gas into stars quickly , the relationship between m@xmath56 and m@xmath38 remains constant .",
    "this is generally what we find , as well as a good agreement with the model predictions .",
    "in fact , the agreement between the total stellar and halo masses with the _ galform _ models is slightly better than the comparison between the stellar and virial masses with 3@xmath20r@xmath16 , which further suggests that the luminous components of disk galaxies are dominated by the stellar mass (  4.3 ) .    in summary , the fact that the ratio m@xmath56/m@xmath38 remains relatively constant in our sample with redshift , and that the stellar - mass tf relation does not evolution , are indications that disk galaxies are forming through the accretion of both dark and baryonic mass .",
    "disk galaxies are undergoing star formation at @xmath3 at a rate of a few solar masses per year .",
    "if disks at @xmath4 contained all the baryonic or halo masses that they have at @xmath60 , we would see an increase in m@xmath56/m@xmath38 with time . because we do not see this trend",
    ", it appears that new stars form out of gas accreted from the intergalactic medium , which is coupled with dark matter at a constant ratio .",
    "this baryonic to dark matter ratio is such that both m@xmath56 and m@xmath38 grow with time , creating a stellar mass to halo mass ratio that is on average relatively constant .",
    "we present the results of a dynamical and structure study of 101 disk galaxies drawn mostly from the deep1 survey with redshifts in the range @xmath820.2 - 1.2 .",
    "new infrared imaging observations are presented which enable us to derive reasonably reliable stellar masses and thereby to construct the stellar mass tully - fisher relation and its redshift dependence . using various formalisms drawn from analytic and semi - analytical models , we attempt to convert our dynamical data to make the first comparisons of the relative fractions of stellar and total mass in our sample . notwithstanding the considerable uncertainties and sample incompleteness",
    ", the results are encouraging and suggest remarkably little evolution in the mix of baryons and dark matter since @xmath821 .",
    "although our sample is not formally complete in luminosity or mass , we explore the degree to which there may have been evolution in the relative distribution of stellar and virial masses and find the following :    1 .",
    "massive disk galaxies exist out to @xmath4 with halo masses as large as 10@xmath87 , roughly as large as the most massive disks in the nearby universe .",
    "these systems also contain a large amount of stellar mass .",
    "at least some disk galaxies are nearly fully mature in their stellar content at @xmath88 .",
    "we confirm earlier studies based on smaller samples and find no significant evolution in the zero point or scatter of the rest - frame @xmath89-band tully - fisher relation out to @xmath12 .",
    "the stellar mass tully - fisher relation out to @xmath12 is likewise largely consistent with the relation found for nearby disks .",
    "we find no significant evolution in our sample after comparing systems at redshifts greater than and less than @xmath90 .",
    "4 .   although there are clearly great uncertainties in estimating total halo masses from our dynamical data , we find the distribution of the ratio of stellar and halo masses remains relatively similar from @xmath60 to @xmath12 .",
    "the stellar fraction observed can be understood if the bulk of the baryons associated with massive disk galaxies have already formed their stars .",
    "a modest number of massive galaxies have very low stellar fractions , consistent with continued star formation as revealed by their blue @xmath91 colors .",
    "these results are in relatively good agreement with @xmath36cdm analytical and semi - analytical models ( benson et al .",
    "2002 ; baugh et al .",
    "2005 ) , suggesting that disk galaxy formation is hierarchical in nature .",
    "our overarching conclusion from this study is that no significant evolution in the stellar mass fraction can be detected in the population of regular massive disks since @xmath821 .",
    "although biases and uncertain assumptions may affect detailed quantities at the @xmath92 dex level , the absence of gross trends is consistent with the conclusion that the bulk of these systems grow at @xmath3 by the accretion of dark and baryonic material .",
    "this conclusion is however tempered by the fact that our selection is affected by a bias that likely changes with redshift .",
    "for example , because our sample was selected by a @xmath93 limit , we are studying the brightest disks at the highest redshifts .    these results , while intriguing , will be examined in much greater detail with the upcoming deep2 redshift survey ( davis et al .",
    "2002 ) , which will combine near - infrared imaging from the hale 5 meter telescope with rotation curves obtained using the deimos spectrograph on the keck ii telescope .",
    "there are several issues that can be better addressed with deeper spectroscopy and a more careful selection of high - z disks . the total number of disks in this much larger sample is expected to be on the order of thousands and will solidify and expand on the preliminary results revealed by this study .",
    "we thank the deep team for generously enabling us to augment their optical sample and catalogs with near - infrared data in order to make this comparison .",
    "we also thank cedric lacey and andrew benson for access to their semi - analytical model simulation results , and xavier hernandez and ken freeman for comments regarding this work .",
