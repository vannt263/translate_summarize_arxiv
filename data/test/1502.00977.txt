    "it is needed to include some matter fields , like scalar field(s ) to resolve it .",
    "another approach which is totally revolutionary is to replace einstein gravity by some extended forms of classical geometrical objects .",
    "a reasonable candidate to explain this situation is modified gravity , in which we replace einstein - hilbert action , given by @xmath5 ( here @xmath6 is the boundary term ) by another set of geometrical objects like second order invariants @xmath7 or functions of ricci scalar @xmath8 , gauss - bonnet topological invariant @xmath9 and so on ( see @xcite- @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "historically , to be more precise , the simplest potentially reasonable candidate was @xmath3 gravity , a theory which it was proposed originally before recent activities @xcite ) and later motivated in light of the recent observational data , as a valid , physically reasonable , ghost - free and stable alternative theory instead of gr @xcite- @xcite .",
    "another type of modified gravity is the one in which geometry has been coupled to the matter fields non- minimally ( see @xcite for an updated review of such models )",

    "symmetry is an important issue to be addressed in any physical system under study .",
    "there are two classes of symmetries : global symmetries , in which the physical system ( dynamical system ) respects some types of transformations , which are defined by functions of coordinates .",
    "another is local , in which the conservation law gives us a `` local '' conserved quantity like charge .    as we mentioned it before , @xmath3 gravity is a ghost free , and conformally equivalent to the scalar field theory in einstein frame .",
    "there are several interesting features in this theory to be useful for late time acceleration , dark energy and dark matter halo problems . also , inflation can be realized successfully using this simple and effective modified theory of gravity . recently to resolve dark matter problem , a new type of modified gravities has been proposed as titled mimetic model and modified versions of it @xcite-@xcite .",
    "basic hidden idea behind this new modification of gravity is to propose a conformally invariant , scalar theory of gravity in which scalar degree of freedom does not cause any problem with ghosts .",
    "the way is to reparametrize metric as a conformal transformation of an auxiliary metric , `` unphysical '' metric .",
    "the point is , the scalar field appeared as conformal function and plays the role of an internal degree of freedom .",
    "this scalar field is not ghost and it is constructed to have unit norm @xmath16 .",
    "this norm is defined on physical metric .",
    "it is remembering for us the role of velocity of a test particle with unit norm in the comoving frame of particle coordinates .",
    "an interesting feature is if we write flrw cosmological equations , an extra term proportional to @xmath17 , appeared .",
    "it mimics dark matter .",
    "so , it was adequate to name it as `` mimetic dark matter '' or briefly mimetic gravity",
    ". to unify @xmath0 gravity with this very interesting mimetic theory , it has been proposed mimetic @xmath0 gravity @xcite as a new class of modified gravities with the same inspiration as mimetic theory .",
    "because of its complexity and more physical solutions , this new mimetic @xmath0 deserves further physical investigations .",
    "very recently the dynamical behavior of mimetic f ( r ) has been investigated @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to address noether symmetry issue of such mimetic models . in literature noether symmetry",

    "our aim in this paper is to explore noether symmetry for the mentioned above to modify gravities : mimetic @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : formal framework for @xmath1 theory of gravity is presented in section  [ f(r , t ) ] .",
    "the formalism of f ( r ) mimetic theory is motivated in section  [ f(r)mimetic ] .",
    "the noether symmetry approach is well understood briefly in section  [ ns ] .",
    "noether symmetry is applied to @xmath1 in section  [ ns1 ] and for @xmath0 mimetic model in section  [ ns2 ] .",
    "we summarize in the last section .",
    "we adopted a `` god '' given system of units @xmath21 , where the gravitational coupling constant is given by @xmath22 .",
    "let us to start by the following simple extension of @xmath0 gravity in four dimensional spacetime : @xmath24 in the action , @xmath8 stands for the ricci scalar of the riemannian space - time , @xmath12 is trace of the energy , momentum tensor of matter lagrangian @xmath25 , is defined by the simple expression @xmath26 .",

    "\\label{var1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to simplify more these functional , we need to redefine an auxiliary tensor field @xmath38 as a part of the variation of trace @xmath39 as the following : @xmath40 and in a similar form as we define @xmath12 , we are able to define trace of @xmath38 as the following : @xmath41 using these simplifications , we write the following form of the equation of motion of @xmath1 : @xmath42 it is remarkable that , when geometry is decoupled from the matter part , in the limit @xmath43 , we recover equation of motion of @xmath0 gravity from ( [ field ] ) .",

    "if we write down lagrangian of @xmath1 for this metric and if we assumed that the universe is filled with matter fields with effective pressure @xmath50 and energy density @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath52 .",
    "since this equation is a constraint , and because of @xmath53 , we introduce a pair of lagrange multipliers as the following @xmath54 . the point like lagrangian after an integration part by part is written as the following ( we set @xmath55 ) : @xmath56 where we suppose that @xmath57 .",

    "briefly , we are interested to know how noether symmetry is able to `` fix '' mathematical forms of @xmath64 .",
    "although @xmath1 provides a reasonable and good extension of @xmath0 theory , it does not respect conformal symmetry .",
    "also , extra degrees of freedom are possible .",
    "so , instabilities due to ghosts probably are happening .",
    "to resolve conformal symmetry and to be ghost - free , a model recently proposed as titled mimetic @xmath65 gravity @xcite .",
    "it is inspired from the mimetic theory @xcite , a model in which dark matter problem is resolved as an integration constant .",
    "also , it is self consistent with conformal symmetry .",
    "the basis of any type of mimetic theory is to parameterize of the riemannian metric tensor @xmath27 as the following conformally transformed formula @xcite @xmath66 here we introduced a pair of auxiliary objects : the first is an auxiliary metric ( unphysical and without dynamics ) @xmath67 and the second is a scalar field degree of freedom @xmath68 which has generally ghost , freedom .",
    "it is well known that using an orthogonality of metric , this scalar field satisfies the following constraint equation of motion : @xmath69 if we know the background metric @xmath70 , this equation fixes the form of the scalar field .",

    "it has been proven that this new theory is conformally invariant and ghost free @xcite .",
    "so , it is remarkable to consider it as a valid extension of @xmath0 gravities .",
    "we consider the same flrw metric as ( [ metric ] ) . in this case",
    ", the constraint equation leads to @xmath85 where @xmath86 is cosmic time .",
    "it is not so hard task to write flrw equations for motion . actually , because our aim is to investigate noether symmetry , so what we need is just point like lagrangian of the mimetic @xmath0 scenario .",
    "to be more generally speaking , we slightly modify the original mimetic @xmath0 by including a potential term and by introducing a lagrange multiplier @xmath87 as the following : @xmath88\\ , .\\ ] ] the point like lagrangian for a fluid with pressure @xmath89 and by taking in to account that @xmath90 , is written in the following form : @xmath91 note that in general @xmath92 . equations of motion are written in the following forms : @xmath93 the second equation is just the standard definition of ricci scalar for flrw metric .",
    "the third one is reduced to the klein - gordon equation in the case of @xmath94 .",
    "the first equation becomes familiar as the equation of motion in @xmath0 gravity , if we set @xmath95 .",
