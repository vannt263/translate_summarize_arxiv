    "the estimation of quantum states is one of the basic primitives in quantum theory .",
    "this general task appears in several modifications and situations .",
    "when many copies of the state are available , one may try to obtain maximal information on the quantum state by employing state tomography @xcite , although the effort may become overwhelming , if the dimension of the system increases . furthermore , tomography is clearly not a viable way , if only few , or even only a single copy of the state are available .    nevertheless ,",
    "if some _ a priori _ information about the state is given , there are several estimation problems which can be meaningfully posed and solved even on the single copy level .",
    "the most prominent is state discrimination , where one knows that the system is in one of several given states , and one needs to decide in which one .",
    "this problem has been discussed in several variations , either one aims for an unambiguous discrimination , or for a discrimination with a minimal error probability @xcite . moreover ,",
    "programmable state discriminators have been proposed @xcite .",
    "other problems considered are state estimation from several copies with collective or separable measurements @xcite , the estimation of certain state parameters ( like the time in an unitary evolution ) @xcite , as well as estimation of the state after a generalized measurement when the premeasurement state is unknown @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the following problem : let us assume that an apparatus is given , which produces for a given input @xmath1 the state @xmath4 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are known .",
    "let us further assume that @xmath1 is determined by some well characterized random number generator , but we do nt know its actual value .",
    "the task is now to estimate @xmath1 from a single copy of @xmath5    such estimation problems can occur in several realistic situations .",
    "for instance , one may consider some process of decoherence , where the single copy of @xmath6 describes the state of a single atom coupled to its environment , and the task is to estimate the rate of decoherence . in this case",
    "@xmath2 represents an initial state , while @xmath3 is the state of thermal equilibrium , which the system assumes eventually .",
    "another example may be that @xmath6 is the reduced state of some multipartite pure state @xmath7 , where one tries to estimate @xmath8 we will discuss the decoherence example later in more detail .    for the estimation one has to perform some measurement .",
    "the must general measurement is described by a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) and we ask for the povm that minimizes the expected deviation between the true value of @xmath1 and the estimated one .    here",
    "we take the viewpoint that the value of @xmath1 is not exactly known beforehand but we may have information about it in form of a prior probability distribution .",
    "after a measurement this prior probability distribution can be updated according to bayes theorem .",
    "minimizing the deviation of the estimate from @xmath1 expected from the posterior probability distribution leads to the so - called bayesian estimator ( cp .",
    "for example @xcite ) .",
    "bayesian estimators have been successfully applied in state discrimination problems .",
    "they are also appropriate in situations where a sequence of consecutive measurements is carried out and the estimate has to be updated after each measurement .",
    "this is for example the case in real - time monitoring of the dynamics of quantum systems . using a bayesian estimator it is possible to monitor oscillations of single qubits in real - time with high accuracy by means of a sequence of weak measurements @xcite .",
    "the bayesian estimator is also intimately related to the continuous estimation of the wave function of a system with arbitrary - dimensional hilbert space by means of continuous measurement @xcite . although the search for the best measurement in connection with an bayesian estimator is performed in this article for the particular task to estimate the parameter @xmath1 in eqn .",
    "( [ eins ] ) , it may be carried out in an analogous way in different set - ups .    for the case",
    "when @xmath9 is a two - level system , i.e. , a qubit , we determine the optimal measurement strategy for arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath10 interestingly , for the case of completely unknown @xmath1 , it turns out that if @xmath2 and @xmath3 do not have the same purity , the optimal measurement does not commute with @xmath11 and hence does not coincide with the intuitive guess which one would make from the bloch sphere picture .",
    "finally , we discuss how the results from the qubit case can readily be used to solve this problem for important higher dimensional cases .",
    "as already mentioned , similar parameter estimation problems have in generality been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and general conditions on the information which can be obtained about the parameter have been formulated .",
    "our aim , however , is to explicitly construct the optimal measurements .",
    "the knowledge of these explicit measurements may further be used to improve schemes for the observation of oscillations with small disturbance @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii we pose the problem in mathematical terms and derive a general condition on the optimal povm . in section iii we show how this general condition can already reduce the set of povms which have to be considered . in section iv we solve the problem for qubits .",
    "we first derive the optimal measurement , if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are pure , then we consider the general case .",
    "we also discuss how one can apply the results for estimating decoherence rates .",
    "finally , in section v we derive some results for higher dimensional systems .",
    "in this paper , we consider the following task .",
    "let us assume that we have a single quantum system with @xmath12-dimensional hilbert space @xmath13 .",
    "its state is known to be a mixture of two states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath14 where for the parameter @xmath1 only some probability distribution is known .",
    "what is the measurement which leads to an optimal estimation of the unknown parameter @xmath1 ?",
    "the estimation of @xmath1 has to proceed in two steps : first , a measurement is carried out on the system .",
    "the statistics of a general measurement can be characterized by a povm and throughout this paper we denote by @xmath15 a povm with the effects @xmath16 in a second step the parameter @xmath1 is estimated by a number @xmath17 ( the estimate ) which depends on the result of the measurement @xmath18 .",
    "let us first discuss the construction of the optimal estimate @xmath17 for a given outcome @xmath18 .",
    "a criterion for the optimality of the estimate @xmath17 can be formulated as follows : @xmath17 is optimal iff the cost function @xmath19 is expected to assume its minimum : @xmath20 here the expectation value @xmath21 is taken with respect to the posterior probability distribution of @xmath1 , which includes the information contained in the occurrence of the measurement result @xmath18 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the probability to obtain the measurement result @xmath18 averaged over all possible occurring states .",
    "taking into account the linearity of the expectation value , one can directly verify that the optimal estimator @xmath17 is equal to the expected value of @xmath1 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the variance of @xmath1 .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ bla ] ) assumes a minimum for @xmath26 .",
    "such a value @xmath17 is also called a bayesian estimate .",
    "having derived the optimal estimate @xmath17 for a certain outcome @xmath18 we can consider the optimal choice of the povm .",
    "now , the optimal measurement is the one which leads to the smallest expected costs averaged over all outcomes @xmath18 : @xmath27 hence the effects @xmath28 have to minimize the mean variance @xmath29 .",
    "note that this variance , just as the expectation of the costs , is defined with respect to the posterior probability density @xmath30 .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "we choose in the following an equally distributed prior density @xmath31 .",
    "we will see later in an example , that this imposes not a big restriction . using @xmath32 $ ] and the probability to obtain measurement result @xmath18 @xmath33 d\\lambda \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\tr\\left[e_m\\frac{1}{2}(\\rho_1+\\rho_2)\\right ] \\label{pm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtain for the posterior probability density in eq .",

    "allows us to calculate the bayesian estimate @xmath17 of @xmath1 , given a measurement outcome associated with the effect operator @xmath44 , since @xmath26",
    ".    the condition for an optimal measurement in case of a general prior probability distribution @xmath45 can be determined from the corresponding mean variance , which is of similar form as ( [ vari ] ) .",
    "it can be derived as in eqs .",

    "again , this may be rewritten in a way similar to eq .",
    "( [ qvonpneu ] ) which is invariant under permutation of @xmath2 and @xmath10 although we consider in the following an equidistributed @xmath1 , thus @xmath31 , we illustrate by an example in section [ four ] that the results we obtain can readily be transcribed for the general case .",
    "now we show two facts about the povm which minimizes the expression of eq .",
    "( [ vari ] ) : we first show that this povm can be chosen to have pure effects , i.e.  effects which are of rank one .",
    "then , we show that this povm must be a so - called extremal povm .    to show that the povm which minimizes the expression of eq .",
    "( [ vari ] ) has pure effects @xmath50 assume that we have a povm where one effect , say @xmath51 is not pure",
    ". then we can decompose @xmath52 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are linearly independent positive operators , which can serve as new effects .",
    "the new povm with the effects @xmath56 gives the same or a smaller value for the cost function .",
    "indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ vari ] ) it follows that it suffices to show @xmath57 where @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59.$ ] eq .  ( [ bedingung1 ] ) can be straightforwardly verified , using the facts that @xmath60 and @xmath61 thus , for our search for optimal measurement strategies , it suffices to consider povms with pure effects .",
    "there are further constraints on the optimal povm @xmath62 these follow from the fact that the set of all povms is a convex set .",
    "given two povms @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath65 outcomes , the convex combination @xmath66 is again a povm with @xmath65 outcomes .",
    "on the other hand there are povms which can not be expressed as a convex combination of two different povms , these are called _ extremal _ @xcite . for our purpose , it is important to note that for convex combinations @xmath67 holds .",
    "this follows because it is true for each of the summands of @xmath68 .",
    "this can be verified e.g. for the summand with the effect @xmath69 by replacing the effects @xmath70 and @xmath71 in inequality ( [ bedingung1 ] ) by @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "since a generic convex combination on the right hand side of ( [ beding2 ] ) assumes only values less than @xmath74 , only extremal povms can maximize @xmath68 and thus minimize the expected costs .",
    "we can summarize : + * proposition 2 .",
    "* when maximizing @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ qvonp ] ) it suffices to consider extremal povms with pure effects .",
    "indeed , we can require both conditions at the same time , since povms with pure effects , which are not extremal , can be written as a convex combination of extremal povms with pure effects .",
    "the two conditions on the povms are a priori independent .",
    "however , for special cases , certain relations are known .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that all extremal povms for qubits have pure effects and maximally four outcomes @xcite .",
    "this fact we will exploit in the following .",
    "in this section we consider the problem for qubits , that is , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are qubit states .",
    "the representation of these states on the bloch sphere will enable us to determine the optimal povm .",
    "we will first derive some general formulation of the optimization problem in terms of bloch vectors .",
    "then we will solve the problem for the case where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are pure and finally for general @xmath2 and @xmath10    we know already that the effects @xmath44 of an optimal measurement are pure , i.e. , @xmath75 here , the states @xmath76 span the whole hilbert space but they are in general not mutually orthogonal .",
    "since we are dealing with qubits the projectors @xmath77 can be expressed by means of bloch vectors @xmath78 : @xmath79 where the components of the vector @xmath80 are the pauli operators @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "thus the effects read @xmath84 with @xmath85 . from the completeness of the effects @xmath86 we obtain the following constraints for the weights @xmath87 and the vectors @xmath88",

    "* proposition 3 .",
    "* when determining the optimal povm for qubits it suffices to consider povms with pure effects and maximally three outcomes where the vectors @xmath88 lie in the plane spanned by @xmath97 and @xmath98 in the bloch sphere",

    ". however , eqs .",
    "( [ qqubita ] , [ qqubit ] ) are still valid , which implies that @xmath111 to proceed , we can now decompose the non - pure effects @xmath112 into pure ones .",
    "this can for example be done by means of spectral decomposition : @xmath113 where the eigenvalues are given by @xmath114 .",
    "please observe , that the bloch vectors @xmath115 of the pure effects @xmath116 point into the @xmath105-@xmath106 plane .",
    "thus it suffices to consider povms with pure effects ( but maybe many outcomes ) in the @xmath105-@xmath106 plane .",

    "this proves the claim .",

    "namely , one aims to produce an entangled state @xmath222 , however noise is added during preparation process .",
    "this situation may be modeled by writing the actual prepared state as @xmath223 now one would like to know whether the state is entangled or not .",
    "our results deliver now a possible strategy for this decision : one may estimate @xmath1 with the methods outlined above , and then apply separability criteria to the state @xmath224 however , since only one copy is available , this does not allow to detect the entanglement unambiguously .",
    "it is interesting to see that this method is different from the standard method for many copies .",
    "then , entanglement witnesses allow the unambiguous detection , since for them a negative mean value guarantees entanglement @xcite indeed , these are different observables : taking the two - qubit case and @xmath225 the optimal witness is @xmath226 @xcite which is different from the observable which leads to the best estimate of @xmath8      another case where we can determine the optimal measurement to estimate the qudit state @xmath227 in ( [ rholambda ] ) is given when @xmath2 and @xmath3 are commuting states , @xmath228=0\\,.\\ ] ] it turns out that measurements leading to the least mean variance are von neumann measurements of observables @xmath142 which commute with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , that is , they have the same eigenvectors as @xmath229 .",
    "the proof can be accomplished in two steps .",
    "first we prove that we can restrict the search for optimal measurements to the class of povms with effects commuting with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , then we argue that among these measurements the projection measurements yield the best estimation of @xmath227 . + * proposition 5 . *",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be commuting , @xmath230=0 $ ] and let the povm @xmath15 represent a measurement to estimate the state @xmath231 .",
    "then there is a projective measurement @xmath232 with @xmath233=0 $ ] for all @xmath18 which satisfies @xmath234 .",
    "_ the commuting states @xmath2 and @xmath3 are simultaneously diagonalizable , @xmath235 thus @xmath42 , see eq .",
    "( [ qvonp ] ) , can be expressed as @xmath236 ^ 2}{\\sum_i e_{mi } \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\rho_1 + \\rho_2\\right)}\\ ] ] with @xmath237 now , the positive operators @xmath238 form a povm , i.e. , they satisfy the completeness relation : @xmath239 it is easy to see that the commutative povm @xmath232 leads to the same value of @xmath68 as @xmath99 .",
    "hence , we have only to consider povms which commute with @xmath2 and @xmath3 to find a measurement which maximizes @xmath68 .",
    "in addition we already learned in section [ condopt ] that an optimal povm is distinguished by pure effects .",
    "together with the commutativity of the effects it follows that the optimal measurement is a projective one . @xmath117 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied parameter estimation for quantum states , when only one copy of the state is available . for one qubit",
    ", we solved the problem by explicitly constructing the measurement that minimizes the deviation between the true value of the parameter and the estimated one , using a bayesian estimator .",
    "furthermore , we showed how the results from the qubit case can readily be used to solve this problem for important higher dimensional cases .",
    "our work can be extended into several directions .",
    "first , one may look at higher dimensional systems , trying to find general solutions for this case . here",
    ", it would be of great interest to find cases where , contrary to the qubit case , general povms allow for a better parameter estimation than von neumann measurements . for practical purposes",
    ", it may also be relevant to develop optimal measurement strategies for several , but a finite number of copies .",
