    "if we assume that @xmath77 is an approximate killing vector of the spacetime , then @xmath78 is a direct consequence . with a proper choice of @xmath41 , the resulting initial data represents a binary system where the black holes are in quasi - circular orbits",
    "this statement begs two questions : 1 ) how do we determine the proper choice of @xmath41 so as to obtain quasi - circular orbits ?",
    "2 ) how do we interpret the initial data for other choices of @xmath41 ?",
    "an answer to the first question was proposed by gourgoulhon et  al.@xcite where they made the ansatz that @xmath41 be chosen so that the adm mass@xcite and the komar mass@xcite agree .",
    "we call this the `` komar - mass ansatz '' , and when it is applied , we refer to it as the `` komar - mass condition '' .",
    "the adm energy is an invariant definition of the total energy of a spacetime as measured by an inertial observer at spacelike infinity .",
    "the adm energy is written as a surface integral at infinity @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is a flat metric .",
    "if the total linear momentum of the system ( as measured by the same inertial observer at infinity ) vanishes , then the adm energy is usually referred to as the adm mass . in our notation",
    ", the komar mass can be written as @xmath83 the komar mass is a valid expression for the total mass of a system only when the system possesses a global timelike killing vector so that the system is stationary",
    ". it is therefore quite reasonable to assume that by choosing @xmath41 so that the komar - mass ansatz will yield initial data which is nearly stationary ( i.e.  in quasiequilibrium ) , which would require that the black holes be in quasi - circular orbits .",
    "the effectiveness of the komar - mass ansatz has been tested numerically in black - hole initial data by comparison with post - newtonian data for binaries in circular orbits@xcite ( and for neutron - star binaries@xcite ) .",
    "there are also additional theoretical reasons for expecting that configurations satisfying the komar - mass condition ( @xmath84 ) will represent systems in quasiequilibrium ( cf",
    ".  refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these arguments show that a system in quasiequilibrium necessarily satisfies the komar mass ansatz",
    ". however , as far as we know , there is no guarantee that a system satisfying the komar - mass condition is necessarily in quasiequilibrium",
    ". it would therefore be interesting to compare the komar - mass ansatz against an independent method for determining circular orbits .",
    "the effective - potential method@xcite will be used below to provide such a comparison .",
    "it is worth noting that when using the komar - mass ansatz in the context of binary systems , care must be used in evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_komar ] ) .",
    "an observer moving along the approximate helical killing vector @xmath77 is not an inertial observer . for a true stationary spacetime",
    ", the helical killing vector can be split globally into separate timelike and rotational killing vectors and the timelike killing vector is used to define the timeline of the inertial observer making the measurements .",
    "the approximate helical killing vector can not be split globally , however it can be split _ asymptotically _ at spacelike infinity . in evaluating the eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_komar ] ) , it is necessary to remove the @xmath85 term from the shift , @xmath4 so that the same inertial observer is used to evaluate both @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "often , the komar mass is written in a from similar to that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_komar ] ) , but with the term involving the shift absent .",
    "in many cases , this yield a correct expression for the komar mass since the contraction of the shift with the extrinsic curvature falls off faster than @xmath88 when the @xmath85 contribution to the shift is omitted .",
    "however , it is _ not _ always correct to simply drop this term .",
    "for example , in painlev - gullstrand coordinates@xcite and their extension to the full kerr - newman spacetime@xcite , this term contains _ the entire contribution to the komar mass_.    in order to answer the second question of how to interpret the initial data when @xmath41 is no longer chosen via the komar - mass condition , we must no longer think of the helical time vector as an approximate killing vector of the spacetime .",
    "a more general interpretation of the choice @xmath74 is that the `` velocity '' of the conformal three - geometry vanishes on the initial - data slice . in the context of a binary configuration",
    "this suggests that the system is at either pericenter or apocenter of some general bound or unbound orbit . when @xmath89 , the system will have no orbital angular momentum and will represent a generalized version of misner@xcite or lindquist@xcite initial data .      in constructing black - hole binary initial data",
    ", we will certainly need the ability to specify the spins of the individual black holes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quasi - equil - bound ] , we mentioned that the excision boundary condition on the parallel components of the shift , @xmath57 , can be used to set the spin of each black hole .",
    "it is tempting to want to interpret @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : parshift_bc ] ) as the rotational angular velocity of the black hole .",
    "however this is not the case . to understand the role of @xmath57 in determining the spin on the black holes , it is useful to consider the special cases of corotating and non - spinning black holes .",
    "while neither case is expected to be seen astrophysically , these cases are useful because they represent situations where we know either what the boundary condition should be or what the final spin should be .",
    "corotating black hole binaries represent the case where the black holes are rotating synchronously with the orbital motion .",
    "a great deal of attention has been payed to such binaries because they represent the only configuration of two black holes that can possess a _ true _ helical killing field@xcite .",
    "a serious fault with such spacetimes is that they can not be asymptotically flat since they contain a balancing amount of incoming and outgoing radiation for all time .",
    "however , for our purposes , they are ideal . first , because we at most have only an approximate helical killing vector , we can still have an asymptotically flat solution .",
    "more importantly , we know that the corotating case possess a killing horizon .",
    "this means that the proper choice for the parallel components of the shift is unambiguously given by @xmath90 .    since corotating black holes necessarily have some non - vanishing rotation ( and therefore spin ) as seen by an asymptotic inertial observer",
    ", clearly @xmath72 can not represent the rotational angular velocity of the black hole .",
    "at least for a newtonian binary system in corotation , the rotational angular velocity should equal the orbital angular velocity of the binary system . for post - newtonian computations of corotating black - hole binaries ,",
    "this is , in fact , the condition used to set the spins of the black holes@xcite . to leading order ,",
    "this is correct .",
    "however , as we will demonstrate below , higher order corrections are needed to correctly estimate the rotational angular velocity of corotating black holes .",
    "non - spinning black - hole binaries are , in some sense , the simplest case . here , the individual black holes have no spin as measured by an asymptotic inertial observer . in previous works ,",
    "we have referred to such systems as having `` irrotational '' black holes@xcite .",
    "perhaps , however , this is not the best terminology as it carries with it the notion of fluid motion which is not appropriate for black holes . from now on",
    ", we will refer to such black holes as being `` non - spinning '' .",
    "how do we choose @xmath57 to yield black holes with no spin ?",
    "we argued previously@xcite that for a binary with orbital angular velocity @xmath41 , we should choose @xmath91 . also , for spherical excision boundaries , we chose @xmath92 as the flat space rotational killing vector , projected into the excision surface , that generates a rotation about an axis parallel to the orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "we also showed that this condition lead to reasonable results . to leading order",
    "this is correct , but again we will show below that it is necessary to modify this choice for the boundary condition in order to produce non - rotating black - hole binaries .",
    "so far , we have discussed the approach used to construct binary initial data in rather general terms .",
    "we have discussed the conformal thin - sandwich decomposition and the choice of boundary conditions for constrained variables within that formalism .",
    "these constrained variables ( @xmath17 , @xmath4 , @xmath33 ) can only be determined after values for the unconstrained variables ( @xmath19 , @xmath37 , @xmath93 , @xmath36 ) have been chosen . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quasi - circ - orbits ] , we discussed the interpretation of initial data when the choice @xmath94 was made .",
    "we will use this choice for @xmath37 in all models constructed below .",
    "we will also make the assumption of _ conformal flatness _ in all of the models we construct .",
    "that is , we will choose @xmath19 to be a flat metric .",
    "this choice impacts upon the physical content of the initial data that we will construct .",
    "it is well known that the spatial metric for a relativistic binary system can not be conformally flat@xcite , nor can the spatial metric of a stationary spinning black hole@xcite or even the metric of a boosted black hole",
    ". however , the errors introduced by the assumption of conformal flatness are not `` grave '' .",
    "there are efforts underway to improve the choice of the conformal metric .",
    "some of these efforts involve using an analytic metric obtain from post - newtonian theory ( cf . ref .",
    "however a more self - consistent approach has been developed by shibata et  al.@xcite for the case of neutron - star binaries and it should be possible to adapt this approach to black - hole binaries in the future .",
    "finally , we choose to use maximal slicing , @xmath95 , in all of the models we construct .",
    "which member of the family of possible maximal slices we choose will depend upon our choice for the boundary condition for the lapse@xcite . as a slicing condition",
    ", we do not expect this choice to impact significantly upon the physical content of the initial data .",
    "we solve the elliptic equations of the conformal thin - sandwich decomposition using the pseudo - spectral collocation method described in refs .",
    "@xcite . as usual with spectral methods ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , the solution is expressed as a truncated series of basis - functions , and is represented by a set of expansion coefficients . for appropriate basis - functions ,",
    "discretization errors decay exponentially with the number of retained basis - functions  @xcite .",
    "the elliptic equations take the form of a set of nonlinear algebraic equations for the expansion coefficients .",
    "these algebraic equations are solved with a newton - raphson method , where in each step a linear problem is solved via standard krylov subspace techniques  @xcite like preconditioned fgmres  @xcite .    for the binary black hole solutions of this paper ,",
    "we need to solve elliptic equations in a computational domain with two excised spheres .",
    "to do so , the computational domain is split into smaller subdomains , namely spherical shells and rectangular blocks .",
    "a shell is placed around each excision surface and a third shell , using a compactified radial coordinate , extends from some intermediate radius surrounding both holes out to the outer boundary which is typically placed at a radius of @xmath96 .",

    "further details of the numerical code can be found in ref .",
    "in particular , fig .  6 of ref .",
    "@xcite displays the convergence of the code for a typical configuration .",
    "the calculations below were performed at a resolution comparable to @xmath97 in this figure and correspond to discretization errors on the order of @xmath98 or @xmath99 for most of the quantities we consider .",
    "in the previous discussion , we referred to the spin of an individual black hole in a binary system .",
    "however , there is no unique , rigorous definition of the spin of a black hole unless it is in isolation and stationary .",
    "we can , however , rigorously define the total angular momentum of an initial - data slice as measured by an inertial observer at infinity .",
    "usually referred to as the adm angular momentum , it can be expressed as @xmath100 where @xmath70 is a killing vector of @xmath1 . for asymptotically flat data",
    ", we can choose this to be each of the three flat - space rotational killing vectors in order to determine the three components of the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "although there is no unique , rigorous definition for the spin of an individual black hole in general , we can estimate the spin based upon a quasi - local definition .",
    "there are many different quasi - local definitions for spin@xcite . while motivated in different ways , they tend to take on a similar form within a @xmath101 framework .",
    "one of the earliest useful definitions was derived by brown and york@xcite .",

    "the problem is that , in general , an exact killing vector will not exist .",
    "however , there are two reasonable choices that can be made .",
    "if our excision surface ( apparent horizon ) is a coordinate sphere within our flat conformal geometry , then we can choose to approximate @xmath70 by one of the 3 flat - space rotational killing vectors centered on the excision sphere and projected onto its surface .",
    "we will denote these three choices by    [ eq : ckvs ] @xmath105    where we assume cartesian coordinates and @xmath106 is measured relative to the center of the excision sphere .",
    "an alternative is to attempt to solve killing s equation .",
    "once we have solved the constraint equations and have full initial data , we know @xmath61 , the physical metric projected onto the excision surface @xmath45 . in ref.@xcite , dreyer et  al .  outlined a general method for finding the killing vectors on a closed 2-surface .",
    "we give the details of our implementation of this method in appendix  [ sec : solv - kill - equat ] . here",
    ", we simply note that exact solutions of killing s equation will not exist in general so what we find are `` approximate '' killing vectors .",
    "it is difficult to make a meaningful quantitative measure of how far a given solution deviates from being a true killing vector . for our purposes , we will attempt to gauge the accuracy of our measured spins by comparison with expected values . for the case of corotating black holes , we know that our boundary condition on @xmath57 is correct and we know , at least to leading order , what the spin of a corotating black hole should be in a binary .",
    "thus , we can compare our quasi - local definition for the spin of a black hole against an analytic result .",
    "below , when we discuss the computed quasi - local spin , we will use the following notation for simplicity : @xmath107",
    "although corotation is not considered to be an astrophysically realistic state for black - hole binaries , it is an important test case because it is the one configuration for black - hole binaries that is compatible with a true helical killing vector@xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic relations obtained by friedman et  al.@xcite , @xmath108 should apply to our conformally - flat data if we had a true helical killing vector and we assume no local change in entropy . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermo_ident0 ] ) , @xmath109 is the magnitude of the total adm angular momentum of the system , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are respectively the surface gravity and area of the killing horizon of each black hole .",
    "corotating black holes also have a non - vanishing spin and , more importantly , a physically well - defined notion of the rate of rotation . together ,",
    "these give us a firm analytic foundation against which we can test our initial data .",
    "let us first consider the thermodynamic identity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermo_ident0 ] ) . we are free to define a fundamental length scale for each of our initial - data solutions",
    ". we can use this freedom to scale our solutions in an attempt to have it satisfy this identity .",
    "of course , eq .  ( [ eq : thermo_ident0 ] ) allows for too much variation for a single length rescaling to guarantee the enforcement of the identity in general .",
    "however , we can use the freedom to define a fundamental length scale @xmath112 along a sequence of initial data to enforce @xmath113 this approach has been discussed previously@xcite , but for completeness , we cover it again here .",
    "using our freedom to define the fundamental length scale @xmath112 along a sequence we define the dimensionful total energy @xmath114 , total angular momentum @xmath115 , and orbital angular velocity @xmath116 consistently via , @xmath117 then , to enforce eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermo_identity ] ) , it is sufficient to determine the change in @xmath112 between two points on the sequence .",
    "this can be done by integrating along the sequence from a point @xmath118 to another point @xmath119 .",
    "doing so , we find @xmath120 where a prime denotes differentiation along the sequence .    now ,",
    "if the komar - mass ansatz is reasonable , then a sequence of initial data with varying separation that satisfies this ansatz should represent a binary in a nearly adiabatic evolutionary sequence of quasi - circular orbits that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermo_ident0 ] ) .",
    "but , having scaled the data to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermo_identity ] ) , the identity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermo_ident0 ] ) has been reduced to @xmath121 . to leading order , @xmath122 for each hole . together with the definition of the irreducible mass @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the area of the black hole s apparent horizon , we find @xmath125 for each black hole .",
    "so , if the komar - mass ansatz is reasonable we should find that @xmath126 along a sequence of initial - data sets .",
    "the second column of table  [ tab : thermo_irr_mass ] lists the irreducible mass of one corotating black hole as we vary the orbital separation and enforce eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermo_identity ] ) . given our excision boundary condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : perpshift_bc ] ) , the apparent horizon is , at least instantaneously , a killing horizon .",
    "the only deviation we should expect in @xmath127 should be due to the fact that we do not have a true helical killing vector and that the apparent horizon is not part of a global killing horizon .",
    "as we see from the table ,",
    "@xmath127 changes only by about one part in @xmath128 over the entire sequence of separations . while small , the variations seen in @xmath127 are larger than the level of accuracy of the initial data computations and the leading digits of the variation are also above the level of truncation error that result from integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermo_scale ] ) .",
    "thus , the variation in @xmath127 seems to be a true artifact of our approximate helical symmetry . on the other hand , it is quite small and this lends support to the komar - mass ansatz .",
    ".the irreducible mass @xmath127 of a single black hole in a corotating , non - spinning , and leading - order ( lo ) non - spinning binary as we vary the coordinate separation @xmath129 .",
    "the length scale is set so that the adm mass of the binary at very large separation is 1 . lapse boundary condition ( [ eq : lapse - bc-2 ] ) was used for all data . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]"
