    "numerous experiments have been carried out to study the highly non - linear interaction of a one - active electron system with an intense infrared laser pulse .",
    "such experimental studies have led to the development of various mathematical methods and numerical algorithms to solve the corresponding time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) .",
    "although the numerical solution of the tdse has provided significant insights into the basic processes resulting from this interaction , namely above - threshold ionisation ( ati ) and high - order harmonic generation ( hohg ) , the comparison of the theoretical results with the experimental data is made difficult because in the experiments , a precise characterization of the temporal and spatial distributions of the laser beam is in general not possible .",
    "furthermore , it is usually very difficult to draw conclusions regarding the actual physical mechanism underlying these processes since it is always _",
    "after _ the laser turnoff that the relevant information about various observables is extracted from the solution of the tdse . + in order to extract valuable information about the interaction mechanisms , one has to rely on models .",
    "the first one that laid the foundation of our understanding of laser - atom interactions is due to keldysh . in his seminal 1965 paper @xcite",
    ", he describes , in the length gauge , the ionisation of an atom as the result of the transition from its ground state to a dressed continuum state .",
    "this dressed continuum is a volkov state @xcite .",
    "it takes into account the dipole interaction potential at all orders while neglecting completely the binding potential .",
    "it is important to note that in this model , the role of all the excited states of the atom is neglected .",
    "in addition , keldysh introduced a so - called adiabaticity parameter @xmath1 where , in atomic units , @xmath2 is the photon energy , @xmath3 the ionisation potential and e the electric field amplitude .",
    "he showed that in the limit @xmath4 , tunneling is the dominant ionisation process while for @xmath5 , ionisation results from multiphoton transitions .",
    "later , keldysh theory has been generalized by faisal @xcite and reiss @xcite who developed an approach based on the s - matrix formalism in the velocity gauge .",
    "it takes into account high - order terms describing multiple rescatterings of the so - called indirect electrons by the coulomb potential of the residual ion .",
    "by contrast to the direct electrons that escape without returning to the residual ion , indirect electrons undergo a quiver motion driven by the oscillating field .",
    "the s - matrix treatment , which can be developed also in the length gauge , reduces to keldysh s result at the first order .",
    "it is after faisal and reiss papers that the terminology `` strong field approximation '' ( sfa ) appeared with the underlying theoretical treatment usually referred to as the keldysh - faisal - reiss ( kfr ) theory . + it is important to mention that kfr theory is not the only one that leads to the theoretical framework of the sfa .",
    "perelomov , popov and terentev ( ppt ) @xcite arrived at expressions similar to those obtained within the sfa by using a formalism based on a time - dependent lippmann - schwinger like equation .",
    "recently , we reformulated the sfa and showed by introducing anzatses that all sfa theoretical schemes may be grouped into a set of families of schemes @xcite . + despite various inherent theoretical problems such as the gauge ,",
    "the sfa theoretical schemes have provided analytical results that have helped to interpret qualitatively the numerical solution of the tdse and to extract the underlying mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , in sfa based approaches , the analytical expressions for various observables involve the classical action thereby establishing a bridge between quantum and classical calculations . however , it is important to stress that in the sfa approaches , the infinite range of the coulomb potential is completely neglected or , equivalently , all the excited states of the atom are not taken into account .",
    "so , strictly speaking , the sfa approaches apply to negative ions only , even though a lot of effort has been made to introduce corrections that take account of the long range of the coulomb potential through , for instance , the classical action @xcite .",
    "+ in order to study in detail the role of the long range of the coulomb potential in the interaction of atomic hydrogen with a strong laser field in a regime where tunnel ionisation dominates ( @xmath4 ) , we have developed more in depth in this paper a model which has been introduced by tetchou _",
    "_ @xcite . in this model ,",
    "one starts with the tdse in momentum space , uses the velocity gauge and replaces the kernel of the nonlocal coulomb potential by a sum of @xmath0 separable potentials , each of them supporting one bound state of atomic hydrogen . under these conditions",
    ", the tdse reduces to a set of @xmath0 coupled one - dimensional linear integral volterra equations of the second kind . +",
    "this model which goes far beyond the sfa , has undeniable advantages .",
    "the first one is its computational simplicity allowing , for instance , to explore the very long wavelength limit without difficulty . with our model including only the 1s state of atomic hydrogen , we are presently working at a wavelength of 40 @xmath6 .",
    "the second important advantage is the fact that it can be generalized , within the mean field approximation to the treatment of one - electron processes in complex systems like a heavy molecule exposed to an ultrashort laser pulse .",
    "+ in this contribution , we treat several key aspects of the model namely the generation of the separable potentials , the gauge problem and the link with the sfa .",
    "we then calculate electron energy spectra and the time evolution of electron wave packets in momentum space .",
    "the study of the time evolution of the electron wave packet in momentum state provides direct information on the ionisation time as well as on the ionisation mechanism when the keldysh parameter @xmath4 . in addition , by comparing our results obtained with our model and within the sfa , we can assess the pertinence of the predictions of the sfa regarding the ionisation mechanism .",
    "+ the paper is divided in three main sections in addition to this introduction .",
    "the second section is devoted to the theory .",
    "we describe the key equations of the model and discuss methods to generate the separable potentials , the gauge problem and the connection with the sfa . in section @xmath7",
    ", we present and discuss our results in detail .",
    "the last section is devoted to the conclusions and perspectives .",
    "atomic units combined with the gaussian system for the electromagnetic field are used through unless otherwise specified .",
    "in order to study the role of the coulomb potential when atomic hydrogen interacts with a strong oscillating electric field in the tunneling regime , it is more natural to work in the velocity gauge and in momentum space @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of ehrenfest s theorem : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the canonical momentum and @xmath10 the coulomb potential .",
    "this equation means that the time evolution of the canonical momentum results only from the gradient of the coulomb potential . therefore ,",
    "in the limit @xmath11 , the canonical momentum becomes a constant of motion which reduces to the drift velocity ( in a.u . ) of the ejected electron .",
    "this contrasts with the length gauge where , from the point of view of the forces acting on the electron , the role of the coulomb potential is decoupled from the electric field .",
    "+ for the sake of clarity , let us recall that in the configuration space and irrespective of the gauge , the canonical momentum is defined by : @xmath12 in the length gauge , this canonical momentum reduces to : @xmath13 where the mechanical momentum @xmath14 with @xmath15 the position vector of the electron . in the velocity gauge ,",
    "the canonical momentum writes : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the potential vector and @xmath18 , the speed of light .",
    "we start from the tdse which governs the dynamics of atomic hydrogen exposed to an external oscillating field .",
    "we work in momentum space and use the velocity gauge within the dipole approximation . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the electric field is linearly polarized along the unit vector @xmath19 the direction of which coincides with the z - axis .",
    "note that any other type of polarization can be treated without additional difficulty . in these conditions ,",
    "the tdse is :",
    "+ @xmath20\\psi(\\vec p , t ) + \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath21 @xmath22 is the kernel of the coulomb potential .",
    "the main idea of the model is to replace this kernel by a sum of @xmath0 symmetric separable potentials supporting @xmath0 bound states of atomic hydrogen : @xmath23 before looking for the solution of eq .",
    "( 2 ) with the kernel replaced by the finite sum of separable potentials , it is convenient to define the following quantities involving the potential vector : @xmath24 ^ 2\\mathrm{d}\\xi,\\\\ b(t)&= & - \\frac1c \\int_0^t a(\\xi)\\mathrm{d}\\xi,\\\\ b'(t ) & = & \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\sqrt{\\frac{i}{i_0}}\\sin^2\\left[\\frac{\\pi t}{t}\\right]\\sin(\\omega t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eqs ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) and the fact that @xmath25 define the potential vector as a sine square pulse of frequency @xmath2 and peak intensity @xmath26 in w/@xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 w/@xmath27 is the atomic unit of intensity and the total duration of the pulse is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of optical cycles within the pulse . in all the results presented here ,",
    "we used a sine square pulse but any other pulse shape may be considered .",

    "3 ) , we first perform a contact transformation of the wave function @xmath31 to eliminate the @xmath32 term from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , @xmath33 and then define the following function : @xmath34 under these conditions , the solution of eq .

    "consequently , we have reduced the 4-dimentional tdse to a system of @xmath0 1-dimentional volterra integral equations .      depending on the constraints we want to impose ,",
    "there are two different methods to generate the separable potentials .",

    "the elements of the matrix @xmath59 are known and given by : @xmath62 eq . ( 14 ) has in fact a finite number of solutions for the elements of matrix @xmath55 in which we omit a global phase factor .",
    "it is therefore necessary to impose some prescription .",
    "we could , for instance , assume that any @xmath56-block of @xmath57 is triangular or symmetric .",
    "in fact we have shown that both prescriptions give results that are not significantly different .",
    "all the results presented here have been obtained by assuming that all the @xmath56-blocks of @xmath57 are triangular . + for the sake of illustration , let us first consider the case of one single separable potential supporting the ground state of atomic hydrogen . in this case",

    "we have : @xmath63 where , @xmath64 in momentum space , the action of this separable potential on the state vector @xmath65 is : @xmath66 by inverse fourier transform , we obtain the action of the same separable potential on the state vector @xmath67 in the configuration space : @xmath68 we therefore see that , in this case , the separable potential reduces to a nonlocal yukawa potential of short range in the configuration space .",

    "this is not the case since in the configuration space , the separable potentials have a short range .",
    "these wave functions associated to the continuum are calculated in section 2.5 .",

    "this function contains the free parameter @xmath80 .",
    "for a given value of this parameter , the expansion ( 23 ) is unique .",
    "if we perform the inverse fourier transform of function @xmath74 , we obtain the coulomb sturmian function in the configuration space up to a normalization factor . in this way",

    "the probability amplitude for the system to stay , at the end of the interaction , in one of the bound states of atomic hydrogen taken into account in the model can be calculated by projecting the final wave packet on the corresponding wave function : @xmath96 the total ionisation probabilty can be defined in two ways : ( i ) as one minus the amount of population staying in all the bound states after the interaction , or ( ii ) via the integration of the energy spectrum .",

    "( 23 ) , we do not know , _ a priori _ how many bound states are well described in the model .",
    "the only way of calculating the ionisation probability in that case , is to integrate the energy spectrum : @xmath101 where , @xmath102 @xmath103 represents the amplitude of probability for the electron to be in the continuum at the end of the interaction ( @xmath104 ) with a velocity @xmath105 .",

    "( 37 ) , the first term is a plane wave and the second term is a correction resulting from the short range separable potential @xmath110 .",
    "+      contrary to what is claimed in @xcite , the formulation of the model is not gauge invariant .",
    "this is true irrespective of the method used to generate the separable potentials unless , of course , all the terms of expansion ( 23 ) are taken into account in the model .",
    "+ the problem of the gauge invariance in the context of nonlocal potentials is rather subtle . following korolev @xcite , a nonlocal potential in the configuration space",
    "can be written as a local potential depending on @xmath15 and @xmath9 . to show it ,",

    "+ if we work then in configuration space , we see that our hamiltonian will contain two terms depending on the momentum : the kinetic energy operator and the potential operator .",
    "it means that if we consider the interaction of the electron with the electromagnetic field , it is necessary to perform the minimal substitution @xmath118 in both terms to obtain a fully gauge - invariant formulation .",
    "however , moving to the momentum space leads , in this case , to a much more complicated equation than eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the solution of which is no longer given by eq .",
    "in addition , the fact that the atomic potential is now depending on the external fields is often considered as non physical @xcite .",
    "this point has been stressed recently by rensink and antonsen @xcite .",
    "they claim that a model involving a nonlocal potential is intrinsically gauge dependent and show that in the case of the linear field response , the length gauge is preferable for nonlocal atomic binding potentials . in the present case however , we are interested in the nonlinear field response .",
    "we calculated the electron energy spectrum for frequencies slightly higher than the ionisation potential where the number of bound states playing a significant role is small .",
    "we performed the calculations ( i ) by using a fully gauge invariant formulation , ( ii ) by using our approach developed in section ( 2 ) in the velocity gauge and ( iii ) by solving numerically the tdse with the full coulomb potential .",
    "it turns out that our approach in the velocity gauge gives results that are in much better agreement with the tdse results obtained with the full coulomb potential than the results obtained by using the gauge invariant formulation of our model .",
    "+ the problem of the existence of a preferable gauge has been studied for a long time in the context of the sfa @xcite .",
    "various sfa calculations have been performed in the length and velocity gauge .",
    "the comparison of these results with those obtained with tdse has shown that the `` best '' gauge depends strongly on what we are calculating and on the field parameters .",
    "in other words , it does nt make a lot of sense to speak about a preferable gauge in that case . in order to solve this problem in the case of sfa , we developed recently a new approach .",
    "we showed that all sfa schemes may be grouped into a set of different families . within a family ,",
    "it is possible to define a length and a velocity gauge scheme that give identical results .",

    "it consists in defining the electron wave packet as the sum of the initial state wave function times a phase factor and a function which is the solution of an inhomogeneous tdse .",
    "it is the phase factor that characterizes a given family . in his attempts to derive a gauge invariant formulation of the sfa",

    "we clearly see the effect of the inter - cycle interference between 400 and 600 atomic units of time around @xmath148 a.u .. the most striking result however , is the fact that the electrons are emitted when the vector potential is at its maximum _",

    "note that this result seems compatible with the `` simple man s model '' based on the classical theory which describes the electrons once they are emitted and in which the electron momentum at the end of the pulse is determined by the value of the vector potential at the time of ionisation provided that these electrons are direct _",
    "i.e. _ do not come back to the residual ion .",
    "it is important to mention also that for the peak intensity considered here ( @xmath136 watt/@xmath27 ) , over - the - barrier ionisation instead of tunneling could be expected to be the dominant ionisation mechanism .",
    "we have checked that all the features we observe in this case are also present at much lower peak intensity .",
    "therefore , when only the ground state is taken into account in our model or , in other words , when the atomic binding potential has a short range like for a negative ion , it becomes clear that the dominant process of emission of electrons results from a laser assisted inelastic collision of these electrons with the residual ion and not from tunneling .",
    "the first order sfa predicts under the same conditions that tunneling is the dominant ionisation process leading preferentially to the emission of very slow electrons .",
    "since the first order sfa only describes the emission of direct electrons and not the re - scattered electrons , the differences with the predictions of the model could indicate that the dominant contribution to the ionisation process comes from the indirect electrons .",

    "+ let us now examine the behaviour of the electron probability density when , in our model , we take into account several bound states of atomic hydrogen , namely the 1s , 2p and 3d states and therefore extending the range of our potential . note that in this specific case , the choice of the corresponding separable potentials is unique .",
    "the laser parameters are the same as before and we consider the emission of electrons in a direction parallel to the polarization axis ( @xmath137 ) . beside the stripes associated to electrons emitted at the maximum of the vector potential ,",
    "new stripes appear , corresponding to low energy electrons emitted when the electric field is near its maximum .",
    "we have checked that these stripes are also present for lower peak intensities .",
    "it is important to note that the ionisation yield decreases systematically as soon as other states than the 1s state are included .",
    "this may be understood in terms of a polarization effect . for a model atom",
    "in which only the 1s state is included , only the continuum state contributes to the polarization of the electron cloud in the presence of the field , thereby leading to a rapid ionisation .",
    "when , in our model , we include excited bound states and in particular , p - states , they will contribute significantly to the polarization of the electronic cloud without necessarily leading to ionisation unless the field becomes very strong .",
    "in this contribution , we have studied in depth and extended an existing model describing the interaction of a one - active electron system with a strong laser field .",
    "the model is based on the expansion of the kernel of the binding potential in momentum space in a finite sum of @xmath0 separable potentials .",
    "this approach requires the solution of a system of @xmath0 one - dimensional volterra integral equations instead of a four - dimensional tdse . here , we focused on three important aspects namely the different ways of generating the separable potentials , the gauge invariance of the model and the link existing between this model and the usual sfa .",
    "+ the separable potentials may be generated by imposing that each of them supports one bound state of the binding potential . in the case where the binding potential is a pure coulomb potential ,",
    "the corresponding kernel can also be expanded in products of separable potentials expressed in terms of gegenbauer polynomials .",
    "these separable potentials depend on a free parameter . by moving to the configuration space",
    ", we have shown that this parameter determines the range of each of these separable potentials .",
    "+ in principle , the tdse associated with our model can be formulated in a fully gauge invariant way provided that the separable potentials depend on the external fields . however , the fact that the separable potentials are field dependent has been considered as unphysical . as a matter of fact , our original formulation which is gauge dependent , turned out to give results for the electron energy spectra in very good agreement with the tdse results obtained by treating the binding potential exactly in cases where the number of states playing an important role is relatively small .",
    "this agreement is not so good if we use the fully gauge invariant formulation instead .",
    "the question of a preferable gauge in this context has also been discussed in a way analogous to what we did recently in the case of the sfa .",
    "+ in the case where the model takes into account only one separable potential which supports the ground state of the atom , we have shown that the usual sfa can be obtained from the model in a well defined limit .",
    "+ we have applied our model to the calculation of the electron probability density in momentum space at a wave length of 800 nm . the study of such probability density as a function of both the time and the canonical momentum along or perpendicular to the polarization axis provides valuable information on the ionisation times and on the ionisation mechanism . in particular",
    ", we have shown that by contrast to the predictions of the usual sfa , our model indicates that for a short range potential the main ionisation mechanism does not involve tunneling . instead , ionisation results from a laser assisted inelastic collision with the residual ion thereby preventing the emission of very slow electrons .",
    "the ejection of slow electrons does occur once several excited states are taken into account in the model .",
    "+ this model opens the route to various applications .",
    "it is ideal to treat the interaction of the hydrogen negative ion considered as a one - active electron system , with an oscillating electric field in the long wave length limit .",
    "furthermore , this model can be generalized within the mean field approximation to the treatment of the interaction of complex molecules with attosecond pulses .",
