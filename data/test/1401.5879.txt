    "top - quality type iia diamond crystals suitable for advanced applications in x - ray crystal optics at synchrotrons and x - ray free - electron lasers ( xfels ) have recently become available due to refinements in the high - pressure high - temperature ( hpht ) crystal synthesis method @xcite .",
    "diamond crystal plates with ( 111 ) surface orientation are of primary importance for front - end diffracting x - ray optics due to a greater intrinsic energy bandwidth of the 111 bragg reflection and the resulting flux of the reflected x - rays compared with those of higher - order reflections . however , production of the ( 111 ) crystal plates with large defect - free regions is a more challenging task compared with production of plates of other orientations close to the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "this is due to ( @xmath4 ) the ( 001 ) diamond hpht growth sector has the best crystal quality and the lowest impurity concentration ; and ( @xmath5 ) the \\{111 } crystal faces are the most resistant to polishing since these planes have the highest atomic density .",
    "( 0.5,0.3)(0,0 ) ( 0.03,0.0 )    the primary application of diamond ( 111 ) crystal plates in x - ray optics are the high - heat - load double - crystal monochromators at synchrotron undulator beamlines ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a scheme of a double - crystal monochromator in bragg reflection geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcm ] .",
    "if the first crystal is made sufficiently thin , the beam transmitted through it can be used in a parallel experiment downstream , i.e. , beam multiplexing .",
    "utilization of x - ray monochromators with low absorption crystals for beam multiplexing was pioneered at the troika beamline at the esrf ( european synchrotron radiation facility , grenoble , france )  @xcite .",
    "this beam multiplexing approach gains even more importance for hard x - ray free - electron lasers , which recently redefined the frontiers of x - ray sciences @xcite . using a single straight electron trajectory of an xfel ,",
    "multi - user operations can not be achieved as is commonly accomplished at storage - ring - based synchrotron sources .",
    "however , multiplexing can be performed by means of x - ray optics , which enables simultaneous delivery of portions of the xfel beam to several experiments .",
    "this yields an increase in the total number of performed experiments and thus reduces the high xfel operating cost per experiment .",
    "highly developed crystal fabrication and processing methods for silicon ( si ) have led to a few attempts to use si crystals for beam - multiplexing xfel monochromators . greater x - ray absorption in si",
    "requires utilization of ultra - thin crystals ( thicknesses @xmath6  5 - 10  @xmath1 m ) to achieve sufficient transmittance of the xfel beam ( 30 - 80% ) over a photon energy of 4 - 10  kev .",
    "high - quality ultra - thin si crystals for xfel beam - multiplexing monochromators can be manufactured using state - of - the - art processing methods @xcite ; however , such ultra - thin crystals have been found unstable in the xfel beam  @xcite .",
    "similar levels of transmittance can be achieved with crystal thicknesses of 50 - 100  @xmath1 m in the case of diamond due to its lower x - ray absorption . the greater crystal thickness and young s modulus for diamond ensure a substantially greater stiffness of the sample .",
    "diamond crystals with such thicknesses are expected to be more stable in the xfel beam if an appropriate crystal mounting scheme is provided .    because of the small divergence ( @xmath7  1  @xmath1rad rms ) of the xfel beam its wavefront is particularly sensitive to imperfections of x - ray optics .",
    "disturbances of the wavefront introduced by the optics should be much less or at least comparable to the beam divergence , which is a challenging requirement , especially for diamond crystal optics prone to crystal defects .",
    "along with the presence of intrinsic defects , a mounting - induced crystal strain is another main factor that leads to deterioration of the crystal diffraction performance , which disturbs the radiation wavefront .",
    "the mounting solution previously developed by some of the co - authors for the diamond ( 001 ) self - seeding xfel monochromator @xcite was found to show limitations in heat transfer between the crystal plate and the graphite holder where the plate was loosely mounted @xcite .    in this work",
    "we report on the production of 100-@xmath1m - thick and 300-@xmath1m - thick type iia hpht diamond crystal plates with ( 111 ) orientation .",
    "each crystal plate has a region with low concentration of defects ( working region ) of about 5  @xmath2  2  mm@xmath3 sufficient for use in xfel optics .",
    "more importantly , we present a solution for strain minimization as a special mounting of such crystals on a rigid substrate .",
    "all parts of the optical assembly were fabricated out of diamond , which improved heat transfer and radiation hardness of the device .",
    "the mounting - induced strain was evaluated using double - crystal x - ray topography in rocking curve diffraction imaging mode .",
    "the mounting induced crystal distortion ( 1.5 @xmath1rad rms variation in the rocking curve peak position across the working region ) was substantially smaller than the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the rocking curve width ( 25 - 30 @xmath1rad ) and still comparable to the divergence of the xfel beam .",
    "two such assemblies were installed into the vacuum tank of the beam - multiplexing monochromator at the xpp instrument of the linac coherent light source and successfully tested @xcite .",
    "the monochromator was operated in bragg reflection geometry , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcm ] . the capability of splitting the xfel beam into a pink ( transmitted ) and a monochromatic ( reflected ) branch was demonstrated , which enables the use of the xfel beam in two experiments simultaneously .",

    "the temperature of crystallization was 1460 @xmath9c at a pressure of 5.5 gpa .",
    "after the crystallization process , diamond crystals were cut by a laser along the @xmath10 crystal plane with a @xmath0  2@xmath9 angular offset from the plane .",
    "the angular offset was introduced to facilitate mechanical polishing of the crystal plates .",
    "the plates were polished to a micro - roughness of @xmath6  10  nm ( rms ) .",
    "preliminary selection of crystal plates with low density of crystal defects was made using lang x - ray topography .",
    "for the final selection of diamond crystal plates , white - beam x - ray topography was performed at the mrcat 10bm ( bending magnet ) beamline  @xcite of the advanced photon source .",
    "white - beam x - ray topographs were obtained in laue ( transmission ) geometry on the diamond plates enclosed in kapton film holders .",
    "the source - to - sample distance was @xmath11  27  m , the effective source size at the beamline was @xmath12  @xmath1 m , and the distance from the sample to the observation plane was @xmath13  0.1  m. thus , the expected spatial resolution in the observation plane was @xmath14  1  @xmath1 m , which was comparable with the photographic resolution of the utilized x - ray film ( agfa structurix d3-sc ) .",
    "we note that the image resolution was somewhat reduced due to crystal instability caused by heat load of the x - rays during the shortest available exposure time ( @xmath6  2  s ) .",
    "multiple images were taken to mitigate this problem .",

    "a few defects of about 10  @xmath1 m in size are noticeable in the working regions of the crystals .",
    "these can be attributed to minor dislocations and micro - inclusions .",
    "the diagonal lines represent stacking faults that likely originate at the growth sector boundaries",
    ". nevertheless , the crystals are of remarkable quality in the 5  @xmath2  2  mm@xmath3 region , especially if compared to commercially available type iia diamond ( 111 ) crystals ( e.g. , the crystal studied earlier by some of the authors @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath6  @xmath17  @xmath1rad ( except bragg - backscattering cases @xmath18  90@xmath9 ) : @xmath19    since the relative energy bandwidth is small , a similarly small relative crystal strain @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the crystal lattice parameter ) can distort the shape of the intrinsic curves and reduce performance of the crystal as a monochromator .",
    "thin bragg crystals are particularly affected since relative deformations of the crystal are larger for a given applied stress ( force ) . a simple fact that a thin crystal has a fixed contact point with a holder ( achieved via bonding using glue , tape , or even grease )",
    "can be distinguished in bragg diffraction from a situation where the crystal has a nearly free boundary ( i.e. , motion of the crystal is constrained only by friction against a crystal holder ) .",
    "such a nearly free boundary condition is appropriate for certain applications ; however , in this case the crystal is very susceptible to vibrations .",
    "also , thermal transfer between the crystal and the holder could be limited due to reduced surface contact .",
    "these factors may severely deteriorate diffraction performance of the crystal under an intense incident x - ray beam .    in this work , an alternative approach to mounting a diffracting crystal is explored , which includes a gentle pressure ( a spring force ) applied to the crystal placed on a rigid substrate .",

    "the diamond plate has two small rectangular cuts on the sides such that the restrainers prevent lateral displacement of the plate on the substrate .",
    "the restrainers have grooves for insertion of 15-@xmath1m - thick cvd diamond stripes ( cvd springs ) that provide gentle force on the diamond plate , thus preventing its vertical displacement .",
    "the force acting on the diamond is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the bending angle of the cvd spring as shown in fig .",

    "thus , for a fixed angle @xmath23 ( in our design @xmath28 ) the force can be controlled by either variation of the length of the spring or variation of the spring stiffness .",
    "increasing the length of the spring was found to be insufficient in our experiments to reach very small forces to minimize mounting strain in diamond crystal plates with @xmath6  100-@xmath1 m thickness .",
    "an additional spring force reduction was achieved by changing the stiffness of the cvd springs . the best solution to substantially reduce the stiffness of the springs was to introduce periodic strain - relief cuts ( perforation ) in the spring as shown in fig .",
