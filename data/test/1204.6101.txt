    "white dwarf asteroseismology is a powerful astrophysical tool that fully exploits the comparison between the observed pulsation periods in white dwarfs and the periods computed for appropriate theoretical models .",
    "it allows us to infer details of the origin , internal structure and evolution of white dwarfs ( winget & kepler 2008 ; althaus et al .",
    "zz ceti ( or dav ) stars constitute the most numerous group of degenerate variable stars .",
    "they are otherwise normal da ( h - rich atmospheres ) white dwarfs that exhibit @xmath0(gravity)-mode pulsations .",
    "recently , our group has performed for the first time a detailed asteroseismological study on an ensemble of 44 bright zz ceti stars by employing fully evolutionary ( that is , non static ) da white dwarf models ( romero et al . 2012 , romero 2012 ) .",
    "our asteroseismological approach basically consists in the employment of a large suite of detailed stellar models characterized by very accurate and updated physical ingredients .",
    "these models were produced by computing the complete evolution of the progenitor stars .",
    "we have applied successfully this approach to the hot gw vir ( or dov ) stars in the past ( see crsico et al .",
    "2007a , 2007b , 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "since the final chemical stratification of white dwarfs is fixed in prior stages of their evolution , the evolutionary history of progenitor stars is of utmost importance in the context of white dwarf asteroseismology .    here , we present a complete set of pulsational results that can be useful to perform asteroseismological studies of zz ceti stars . these include the internal chemical profiles and the run of the brunt - visl and lamb frequencies , as well as a large set of adiabatic pulsation periods , time - averaged oscillation kinetic energies , and first order rotational splitting coefficients .",
    "all these quantities can be freely downloaded from our website .",
    "this database can be used in two ways : ( 1 ) carrying out period fits using directly the bank of periods we provide , corresponding to our set of equilibrium da white dwarf models , or alternatively , ( 2 ) by scaling our internal chemical profiles to the structure of other independent da white dwarf models , and then by performing period fits using the pulsation periods computed for such models .",
    "below , we summarily describe the input physics of our models and the pulsation computations , and then we present the format of our database .",
    "the state - of - the - art da white dwarfs evolutionary models employed have been computed with the lpcode evolutionary code .",
    "details of this code and the input physics that this code includes can be found in althaus et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , renedo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and references therein .",
    "below , we briefly enumerate the main physical ingredients :    * for the high - density regime characteristics of white dwarfs , we have used the equation of state ( eos ) of segretain et al .",
    "* for the low - density regime , we used an updated version of the eos of magni & mazzitelli ( 1979 ) . *",
    "radiative opacities are from the opal project ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) , including carbon- and oxygen - rich composition , supplemented at low temperatures with the molecular opacities of alexander & ferguson ( 1994 )",
    ". * conductive opacities are those of cassisi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . *",
    "neutrino emission rates are taken from itoh et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and haft et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . *",
    "the @xmath1c(@xmath2o reaction rate , of special relevance for the c - o stratification of the white dwarf , is that of angulo et al .",
    "* convection has been modeled with the formalism of the mixing - length theory as given by the ml2 parametrization ( tassoul et al .",
    "* treatment of the chemical profiles .",
    "we have considered the distinct physical processes that are responsible for changes in the chemical abundance distribution during white dwarf evolution : * * element diffusion : it strongly modifies the chemical composition profile throughout their outer layers .",
    "we have considered gravitational settling as well as thermal and chemical diffusion of @xmath3h , @xmath4he , @xmath5he , @xmath1c , @xmath6c , @xmath7n , and @xmath8o .",
    "the treatment of time - dependent diffusion is based on the multicomponent gas treatment presented in burgers ( 1969 ) .",
    "diffusion becomes operative once the wind limit is reached at high effective temperatures ( unglaub & bues 2000 ) . as shown in previous studies ,",
    "diffusion in the white dwarf envelope is a key ingredient as far as the mode - trapping properties of zz ceti stars is concerned . * * abundance changes resulting from residual nuclear burning ( mostly during the hot stages of white dwarf evolution ) have been taken into account .",
    "nuclear burning fixes the maximum value of @xmath9 that is expected in a da white dwarf . *",
    "* chemical re - homogenization of the inner carbon - oxygen profile induced by rayleigh - taylor instabilities has been considered following salaris et al .",
    "these instabilities arise because of the positive molecular weight gradients that remain above the flat chemical profile left by convection during core helium burning .",
    "we have employed the pulsation code described in crsico & althaus ( 2006 ) , which is coupled to the lpcode evolutionary code .",
    "the pulsation code is based on a general newton - raphson technique that solves the full fourth - order set of equations governing linear , adiabatic , nonradial stellar pulsations following the dimensionless formulation of dziembowski ( 1971 ) ( see unno et al .",
    "the pulsation code provides the dimensionless eigenfrequency @xmath10 ( @xmath11 being the radial order of the mode ) and eigenfunctions @xmath12 . from these basic quantities ,",
    "the code computes pulsation periods ( @xmath13 ) , time - averaged oscillation kinetic energies ( @xmath14 ) , rotation splitting coefficients ( @xmath15 , weight functions ( @xmath16 ) , and variational periods ( @xmath17 ) for each computed eigenmode ( see appendix a of crsico & althaus 2006 for the definition of these quantities ) . usually , the relative difference between @xmath17 and @xmath13 is lower than @xmath18 , which represents the typical uncertainties in our theoretical periods .",
    "the prescription we follow to assess the run of the brunt - visl frequency ( @xmath19 ) for a degenerate environment typical of the deep interior of a white dwarf is the so - called `` ledoux modified '' treatment ( tassoul et al .",
    "1990 ) , appropriately generalized to include the effects of having three nuclear species ( oxygen , carbon , and helium ) varying in abundance in the same place of the star ( a triple chemical interface ) .",
    "[ figure1 ] displays an example of the chemical profiles of our models with a fixed stellar mass and effective temperature and for different thicknesses of the h envelope ( upper panel ) , and the run of the brunt - visl and lamb ( for @xmath20 ) frequencies ( lower panel ) .",
    "details can be found in romero et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and romero ( 2012 ) .",
    "we present results for da white dwarf models with stellar masses , effective temperatures and h envelope thicknesses in the ranges @xmath21 , @xmath22 k , and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we have performed pulsation calculations on about ( @xmath24 da white dwarf models . in this account , we have considered the number of stellar mass values ( @xmath25 ) , the number of thicknesses of the h envelope for each sequence ( @xmath26 ) , and the number of models ( @xmath27 ) with effective temperature in the interval @xmath28 k , respectively . for each model , adiabatic pulsation @xmath0-modes with @xmath29 and @xmath30 and periods in the range @xmath31 s have been computed .",
    "this range of periods corresponds ( on average ) to @xmath32 for @xmath20 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "so , more than @xmath35 adiabatic pulsation periods have been computed .",
    "an example of our pulsation results is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , where we show the forward period spacing , the oscillation kinetic energy , and the first order rotational splitting coefficients for the same models analyzed in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "note the gradual changes experienced by these quantities as we vary the value of the h envelope thickness .            in table",
    "[ table1 ] we show the grid of evolutionary sequences included in our database .",
    "the values of the stellar mass of our set of da white dwarf models are shown in the upper row .",
    "the masses of h corresponding to the different envelope thicknesses for each stellar mass are shown in rows 2 to 9 .",
    "row 2 corresponds to the maximum value of the thickness of the h envelope for each stellar mass according to our evolutionary computations ( `` canonical envelopes '' ) .",
    "rows 3 to 9 correspond to h envelopes thinner than the canonical ones .",
