    "particle physics is at a crossroads . behind us is the standard model ( sm ) , the remarkably successful theory of all known elementary particles and their interactions .",
    "ahead of us is an equally remarkable array of possibilities for new phenomena at the weak scale .",
    "never before has an energy scale been so widely anticipated to yield profound insights , and never before have there been so many ideas about exactly what these insights could be . in this article , we review the current state of experimental searches for supersymmetry , the most widely studied extension of the sm",
    ".      there are at present many reasons to expect new physics at the weak scale @xmath0 .",
    "chief among these is the higgs boson , an essential component of the sm that has yet to be discovered . at the same time , there are also strong motivations for new phenomena beyond the higgs boson .",
    "these motivations include naturalness , dark matter , and unification .",
    "the physical mass of the sm higgs boson is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the bare mass parameter present in the lagrangian , and the quantum corrections are @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a dimensionless gauge or yukawa coupling , and @xmath5 is the energy scale at which the sm is no longer a valid description of nature .",
    "because @xmath6 is proportional to @xmath7 ( `` quadratically divergent '' ) , it is natural to expect the higgs mass to be pulled up to within an order of magnitude of @xmath5 by quantum corrections  @xcite . given that unitarity and precision constraints require @xmath8 to be at the weak scale  @xcite , this implies @xmath9 , and new physics should appear at the current energy frontier . of course",
    ", the higgs boson may not be a fundamental scalar , but in this case , too , its structure requires new physics at the weak scale  @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , naturalness is among the most robust motivations for new physics at an energy scale accessible to accelerator - based experiments .      in the last decade ,",
    "a wealth of cosmological observations have constrained the energy densities of baryons , non - baryonic dark matter , and dark energy , in units of the critical density , to be  @xcite @xmath10 the non - baryonic dark matter must be stable or very long - lived and dominantly cold or warm .",
    "none of the particles of the sm satisfies these conditions , and so cosmology requires new particles .",
    "perhaps the simplest production mechanism for dark matter is thermal freeze out  @xcite . in this scenario , a new particle is initially in thermal contact with the sm , but as the universe cools and expands , this particle loses thermal contact and its energy density approaches a constant . under very general assumptions ,",
    "this relic energy density satisfies @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dark matter s thermally - averaged annihilation cross section .",
    "it is a tantalizing fact that , when this cross section is typical of weak - scale particles , that is , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is near the observed value of @xmath16 given in eq .",
    "( [ omegas ] ) .",
    "if thermal freeze out is the mechanism by which dark matter is produced in the early universe , then , cosmological data therefore also point to the weak scale as the natural scale for new physics .",
    "the sm is consistent with the observed properties of all known elementary particles .",
    "it also elegantly explains why some phenomena , such as proton decay and large flavor - changing neutral currents , are not observed .",
    "the latter fact is highly non - trivial , as evidenced by the intellectual contortions required of model builders who try to extend the sm .    at the same time",
    ", the sm contains many free parameters with values constrained by experiment , but not explained .",
    "the number of free parameters may be reduced in unified theories , in which the symmetries of the sm are extended to larger symmetries .",
    "in particular , grand unified theories , in which the su(3 ) @xmath17 su(2 ) @xmath17 u(1 ) gauge structure is extended to larger groups , are significantly motivated by the fact that the sm particle content fits perfectly into multiplets of su(5 ) and larger groups  @xcite , potentially explaining the seemingly random assignment of quantum numbers , such as hypercharge .    one straightforward implication of the simplest ideas of grand unification is that the gauge couplings of the sm must unify when extrapolated to higher scales through renormalization group evolution .",
    "the gauge couplings do not unify at any scale given the particle content of the sm , but they do unify at the value @xmath18 at @xmath19 if the sm is minimally extended by supersymmetry ( susy ) _ and _ the supersymmetric particles are at the weak scale  @xcite .",
    "this unification is highly non - trivial , not only because the couplings are now so precisely measured , but also because @xmath20 is in the perturbative regime and @xmath21 is in the narrow range that is both high enough to suppress proton decay and low enough to avoid quantum gravitational effects .",
    "this unification is only logarithmically sensitive to the superpartner mass scale , and the degree of its success is somewhat model - dependent ; see , _",
    "e.g. _ , the review by raby in ref .  @xcite . in conjunction with the previous two motivations ,",
    "however , it provides still more evidence for new physics at the weak scale , and selects supersymmetry as a particularly motivated possibility .",
    "there are two main areas where new phenomena could appear in particle physics .",
    "deviations from sm predictions could show up in measurements performed with increasing precision .",
    "examples are the anomalies observed in the forward - backward asymmetry in the production of @xmath22 pairs in @xmath23 collisions at the @xmath24 peak ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , particularly section 7.3.5 ) , or in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( see , _ e.g. _ , the review by hcker and marciano in ref .",
    "even if such anomalies receive experimental confirmation at a sufficient significance level , their interpretation will however remain ambiguous , because it will involve virtual contributions to the relevant amplitudes of yet undiscovered , therefore most likely very massive , particles .",
    "the alternative approach is to try to observe directly the production of these new particles , which is among the goals of the experiments at colliders operating at the highest possible energies .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will soon occupy the energy frontier . when it comes into operation",
    ", @xmath25 collisions will take place at a center - of - mass energy of 10 tev , and of 14 tev later on .",
    "the instantaneous luminosity will be raised first to @xmath26 and progressively to @xmath27 . with the enormous data samples accumulated",
    ", the two general purpose experiments at the lhc , atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite , will be in a position to explore in great detail the physics at the tev scale . since this is an entirely new domain , and",
    "since there are strong reasons to expect new phenomena at that scale , as advocated in the preceding section of this review , it may well be that ground breaking discoveries are made at the lhc , even after a short period of operation , once the detectors are properly aligned , calibrated , and well understood .    until then ,",
    "the most constraining results on searches for new phenomena at high energy have been or are still being obtained at lep , hera , and the tevatron . providing a comprehensive account of such searches for supersymmetry is the purpose of this review .    the large @xmath23 collider ( lep ) at cern operated from 1989 to 2000 . in a first phase ( lep1 ) , the center - of - mass energy was set at or close to 91  gev , the peak of the @xmath24 boson resonance .",
    "four experiments , aleph  @xcite , delphi  @xcite , l3  @xcite , and opal  @xcite studied millions of @xmath24 decays that allowed them to perform stringent precision tests of the sm .",
    "from the end of 1995 on , the energy was progressively increased ( lep2 ) to reach 209  gev in the center of mass during the last year of operation .",
    "altogether , each of the experiments collected a total of @xmath28  fb@xmath29 of data , of which @xmath30  pb@xmath29 in 2000 at and above 204  gev , the data set most relevant for new particle searches .    at desy",
    ", the hera collider operation was terminated in june 2007 .",
    "there , @xmath31 collisions were collected by two experiments , h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite , at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath32  gev .",
    "this was an asymmetric collider , with @xmath33 and proton beam energies of 30 and 820  gev , respectively .",
    "an upgrade took place in 2001 ( hera2 ) , leading to higher luminosities than in the previous phase ( hera1 ) , and allowing operation with polarized @xmath33 beams .",
    "the data sets collected at hera1 and hera2 with electron or positron beams altogether correspond to an integrated luminosity of @xmath34  fb@xmath29 per experiment .    until the lhc comes into operation",
    ", the highest energy collisions are provided by the tevatron @xmath35 collider at fermilab . during its first phase of operation (",
    "run  i ) , the center - of - mass energy was set to 1.8  tev , and a data sample of @xmath36  pb@xmath29 was collected by each of the two experiments , cdf  @xcite and d  @xcite .",
    "the highlight of that period was the discovery of the top quark in 1995 .",
    "major upgrades of the accelerator complex and of the two detectors took place for the second phase ( run  ii ) , which began in 2001 . the center - of - mass energy was raised to 1.96  tev , and the instantaneous luminosity was progressively increased to regularly approach or exceed @xmath37 in 2008 .",
    "more than 5  fb@xmath29 of integrated luminosity had been delivered by the tevatron by the end of fiscal year ( fy ) 2008 , and it is expected that another @xmath38  fb@xmath29 of luminosity will be provided per additional year of operation . at the time of writing , running in fy 2009 is underway , running in fy 2010 is increasingly likely , and running in fy 2011 is kept as an option .",
    "all general purpose detectors at colliders share similar features .",
    "a cylindrical `` barrel '' structure parallel to the beam axis surrounds the interaction region , and is closed by `` end caps '' perpendicular to the beam .",
    "the first elements encountered beyond the beam pipe are charged - particle detectors , with those closest to the interaction point benefiting from the highest spatial precision .",
    "this tracking system is immersed in an axial magnetic field provided by a solenoidal magnet . beyond the tracking system ,",
    "electromagnetic calorimeters provide electron and photon identification and energy measurement .",
    "these are followed by hadron calorimeters for the measurement of jet energies .",
    "finally , track detectors are used to identify and measure the muons which have penetrated through the calorimeters and possibly additional absorber material .",
    "non - interacting particles , such as neutrinos , are detected by an apparent non - conservation of energy and momentum . in @xmath23 annihilation ,",
    "the missing energy and momentum can be directly inferred from a measurement of the final state particles , by comparison with the center - of - mass energy of the collision . in hadronic or @xmath39 collisions ,",
    "the partons participating in the hard process carry only a fraction of the beam energy , and the beam remnants associated with the spectator partons largely escape undetected in the beam pipe . as a consequence ,",
    "only conservation of the momentum in the direction transverse to the beams can be used , and the relevant quantity is the missing transverse energy , rather than the total missing energy .    the mass reach in @xmath40 collisions at the tevatron is expected to be substantially larger than at lep because of the higher center - of - mass energy . however , since the initial partons participating in the hard process carry fractions @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the beam energy , the effective center - of - mass energy is only @xmath43 . because of the rapidly falling parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) as a function of those energy fractions ,",
    "increasingly large integrated luminosities are needed to probe larger and larger @xmath44 values . at hera , furthermore , the center - of - mass energy in the @xmath45 collision can not be fully used for new particle production , except in some very specific instances .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath23 or @xmath46 annihilation , and to @xmath47 fusion . as a consequence ,",
    "the most constraining results on new particle searches typically come from lep and from the tevatron .    in the following , all limits quoted",
    "are given at a confidence level of 95% .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite is an extension of poincar symmetry , which encompasses the known spacetime symmetries of translations , rotations , and boosts . as with the poincar and internal symmetries , susy transforms particle states to other particle states .",
    "in contrast to these other symmetries , however , susy relates states of different spin , transforming fermions into bosons and vice versa .",
    "none of the known particles can be supersymmetric partners of other known particles . as a result , susy predicts many new particle states . if susy were exact , these particles would be degenerate with known particles .",
    "since this is experimentally excluded , if susy is a symmetry of nature , it must be broken .",
    "susy is the most studied extension of the sm because it directly addresses several of the motivations for new physics discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] .",
    "in supersymmetric theories , the quadratically divergent loop contributions to the higgs boson mass from sm particles are canceled by similar contributions from superpartners , ameliorating the gauge hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric theories also include excellent dark matter candidates , in the form of neutralinos  @xcite and gravitinos  @xcite , that may naturally have the desired relic density .",
    "finally , susy is strongly motivated by the hope for unifying forces , as it makes gauge coupling unification possible in simple grand unified theories ( guts )  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that _ all _ of these virtues are preserved only if the superpartner mass scale is around the weak scale .",
    "the existence of susy in nature , although not necessarily at the weak scale , is also motivated by string theory and the beautiful mathematical properties of susy that are beyond the scope of this review .    for these reasons",
    ", this review is devoted to searches for susy at colliders . in this section ,",
    "we present brief summaries of the supersymmetric spectrum , parameters , and unifying frameworks to establish our conventions and notation .",
    "more extensive phenomenological reviews of susy may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .      in this review ,",
    "we focus our attention on the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , the supersymmetric model with minimal field content .",
    "bosonic superpartners are given names with the prefix `` s , '' and fermionic superpartners are denoted by the suffix `` ino . ''",
    "squarks and sleptons are collectively known as `` sfermions , '' and the entire group of superpartner particles are often called `` sparticles . ''    the particle content of the mssm is in fact slightly more than a doubling of the sm particle content .",
    "this is because , in addition to introducing superpartners for all known particles , the mssm requires two electroweak higgs doublets .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , in the sm , mass terms are generated for up- and down - type particles by yukawa couplings to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , where @xmath49 is the sm higgs field . in susy ,",
    "yukawa couplings are generalized to terms in a superpotential , a function of superfields that contain both sm particles and their superpartners , which generates the sm yukawa couplings as well as all other terms related to these by susy .",
    "complex - conjugated fields are not allowed in the superpotential , however . as a result , two separate higgs fields , denoted @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are required to generate masses through the superpotential terms @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are the su(2 ) quark doublet , up - type quark singlet , down - type quark singlet , lepton doublet , and lepton singlet superfields , respectively , and the @xmath4 couplings are yukawa couplings .",
    "second , susy requires that the sm higgs field have fermion partners , the higgsinos .",
    "the introduction of these additional fermions charged under sm gauge groups ruins anomaly cancellation , making this theory mathematically untenable .",
    "the introduction of an additional higgs doublet , with its extra higgsinos , restores anomaly cancellation .",
    "the mssm higgs boson sector therefore consists of eight degrees of freedom . as in the sm ,",
    "three of these are eaten to make massive @xmath58 and @xmath24 bosons , but five remain , which form four physical particles : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the cp - even neutral higgs bosons , with @xmath60 lighter than @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the cp - odd neutral higgs boson , and @xmath63 is the charged higgs boson .    the remaining supersymmetric particle content of the mssm is straightforward to determine and consists of the following states : @xmath64 each sm chiral fermion has a ( complex ) scalar partner , denoted by the appropriate chirality subscript .",
    "the dimensionless couplings of all of these particles are fixed by susy to be identical to those of their sm partners .",
    "note , however , that , as described in the appropriate sections below , the states in each line of eq .",
    "( [ sparticles ] ) ( except for the last one ) may mix , and mass eigenstates are in general linear combinations of these gauge eigenstates .    finally , most analyses of susy include the supersymmetric partner of the graviton : @xmath65 although not technically required as a part of the mssm , when susy is promoted to a local symmetry , it necessarily includes gravity , and the resulting supergravity theories include both gravitons and gravitinos .",
    "the gravitino is therefore present if susy plays a role in unifying the sm with gravity , as in string theory .",
    "if susy were exact , the gravitino s properties would be determined precisely by the graviton s , and it would be massless and have gravitational couplings suppressed by the reduced planck mass @xmath66 .",
    "however , just as goldstone bosons appear when conventional symmetries are spontaneously broken , a fermion , the goldstino @xmath67 , appears when susy is broken .",
    "the gravitino then becomes massive by eating the goldstino . in terms of @xmath68 , the mass dimension-2 order parameter of susy breaking ,",
    "the gravitino mass becomes @xmath69 and , very roughly , its interactions in processes probing energy scale @xmath57 may be characterized by a dimensionless coupling @xmath70 light gravitinos couple more strongly . as we will see below , in well - motivated supersymmetric theories , these properties may take values in the range @xmath71 where we have assumed colliders probing @xmath72 .",
    "as noted above , if susy exists in nature , it must be broken .",
    "although many different lagrangian terms could be added to break susy , only some of these are allowed if susy is to stabilize the gauge hierarchy .",
    "these terms , known as `` soft '' susy - breaking terms , include most , but not all , lagrangian terms with mass dimension 3 and below  @xcite .",

    "\\label{soft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these lines are sfermion masses , gaugino masses , trilinear scalar couplings ( `` @xmath62-terms '' ) , and higgs boson couplings .",
    "in addition to the parameters above , there are two other key parameters : the @xmath74 parameter , which enters in the higgsino mass terms @xmath75 , and @xmath76 which parameterizes how the sm higgs vacuum expectation value is divided between the two neutral higgs scalars .    the interactions of eq .",

    "this implies that all interactions involve an even number of superpartners , and so the lightest superpartner is stable , and a potential dark matter candidate .",
    "@xmath77-parity violation generically violates both baryon and lepton number , leading to too - rapid proton decay , which is why , for most of this review , we limit ourselves to the @xmath77-parity conserving case .    even restricting ourselves to the @xmath77-parity - preserving terms of eq .",
    "( [ soft ] ) , however , we see that susy introduces many new parameters .",
    "note that the terms involving sfermions need not be flavor - diagonal , and so the sfermion masses and @xmath62-terms are in fact matrices of parameters in the most general case . at the same time , fully general flavor mixing terms violate low energy constraints on flavor - changing neutral currents .",
    "in addition , arbitrary complex parameters also violate bounds on cp - violation from , for example , @xmath81 and the electric dipole moments of the electron and neutron .",
    "these considerations motivate unifying frameworks , to which we now turn .      in collider searches , it is desirable to consider theories that are both viable and simple enough to be explored fully . for this reason ,",
    "it is common to work in simple model frameworks that reduce the number of independent susy parameters . in some cases",
    ", these model frameworks also motivate particular collider signatures that might otherwise appear highly unlikely or fine - tuned .    in the most common unifying frameworks",
    ", susy is assumed to be broken in some other sector .",
    "susy breaking is then mediated to the mssm through a mechanism that defines the framework .",
    "this sets susy - breaking parameters at some high energy scale .",
    "renormalization group evolution to the weak scale then determines the physical soft susy - breaking parameters and the physical spectrum of the mssm .",
    "a representative example of renormalization group evolution is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mssmrun ] . in this evolution from the high scale to the weak scale , gauge couplings increase masses and yukawa couplings decrease masses .",
    "this is central to understanding the sparticle spectrum of many models .",
    "in addition , it explains why @xmath82 becomes negative at the weak scale  it is the only particle to receive large negative contributions from yukawa couplings without compensating large positive contributions from the strong coupling .",
    "when @xmath50 becomes tachyonic , it breaks electroweak symmetry , and this feature , known as `` radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , '' is a virtue of many supersymmetric frameworks .",
    "note , however , that radiative electroweak symmetry breaking makes essential use of the large top quark mass , and so shifts the burden of understanding why electroweak symmetry is broken to the question of why the top quark is heavy .     to the weak scale in a representative msugra model . from ref .",

    "once collisions begin at the lhc and the detectors are sufficiently understood , it will not take more than @xmath28  fb@xmath29  to discover squarks and gluinos with masses less than @xmath38  tev  @xcite .",
    "a new era will then begin during which the whole susy spectrum will have to be deciphered , and the properties of the susy model established .",
    "many more fb@xmath29  will be needed for that purpose , and to unravel the spectrum of susy higgs bosons .",

    "<S> , weak - scale supersymmetry encompasses a wide range of experimental signals that are also found in many other frameworks . </S>",
    "<S> we recall the motivations for supersymmetry and review the various models and their distinctive features . </S>",
    "<S> we then comprehensively summarize searches for neutral and charged higgs bosons and standard model superpartners at the high energy frontier , considering both canonical and non - canonical supersymmetric models , and including results from lep , hera , and the tevatron . </S>"
