    "we call these groups of nine elements _ regions _ , and the completed grid a _ sudoku board_. a subset of a sudoku board that uniquely determines the rest of the board is a sudoku puzzle , as illustrated in figure 1 , taken from @xcite . note that this puzzle contains only eighteen starting clues , which is the conjectured minimum number of clues for a 180-degree rotationally symmetric sudoku puzzle",
    ".                    the current body of work on sudoku ranges from popular interest monographs such as wilson @xcite and appeals to the mathematical interest in sudoku and its variants for an undergraduate math audience as in taalman @xcite to a wide range of more theoretical papers .",

    "@xcite apply grbner basis techniques to sudoku , and newton and desalvo @xcite investigate the shannon entropy of collections of sudoku matrices .",
    "most relevant to our current research is a sophisticated piece of computation by felgenhauer and jarvis @xcite showing that there are 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 different sudoku boards and a related paper by russell and jarvis @xcite that showed that these boards split into 5,472,730,538 equivalence classes under the action of the standard sudoku symmetry group .    in this paper , we consider various symmetry groups for the more accessible variant of sudoku known as shidoku .",
    "shidoku board _ is a @xmath0 latin square whose regions ( rows , columns , and designated @xmath1 blocks ) each contain the integers one to four exactly once . in this smaller universe",
    "it is not too difficult to show that there are 288 different shidoku boards @xcite .",
    "there are a small number of generating symmetries for shidoku and while the full shidoku symmetry group is well known to be relatively large , we establish several different subgroups of minimal size which generate the same equivalence relation among shidoku boards as the full group of symmetries .",
    "we follow this with a discussion of burnside s lemma ( as used in @xcite ) where we demonstrate one practical application of such minimal symmetry groups .",
    "finally , we show how all minimal symmetry groups satisfying various conditions may be attained by considering equivalence classes of group actions on graphs .",
    "the russell and jarvis computation @xcite involved computer methods in part because of the large size of the sudoku symmetry group .",
    "our work is a first step in simplifying such a calculation by reducing to a smaller , but still complete sudoku symmetry group .",
    "a _ shidoku symmetry _ is a map from the set @xmath2 of shidoku boards to itself . we will call elements of @xmath3 that permute the values @xmath4 on the board _ relabeling symmetries _ , and elements of @xmath5 that permute the cells of the board while preserving the shidoku conditions on every possible board _",
    "position symmetries_. note that every element of @xmath3 defines a valid relabeling symmetry , but not every element of @xmath5 defines a valid position symmetry . for example , swapping the first and second rows of any shidoku board preserves the shidoku conditions , but swapping the second and third rows does not always preserve the shidoku conditions .",
    "every shidoku symmetry is a combination of the set @xmath3 of relabeling symmetries and the set @xmath6 of position symmetries described above .",
    "therefore the _ full shidoku symmetry group _ is the direct product @xmath7 .",
    "the action of this group partitions the set @xmath2 of shidoku boards into two orbits , and we call two shidoku boards are _ equivalent _ if they are in the same orbit under the action of the full shidoku symmetry group @xmath8 . the 288 shidoku boards split into two such equivalence classes , one with 96 boards which we refer to as _ type 1 _ boards , one of which is on the left in figure 2 , and one with 192 boards , called _ type 2 _ boards , one of which is given on the right in figure 2 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the position symmetry group @xmath6 is generated by the following symmetries , where a _ band _ is the combination of either the first and second or the third and fourth rows , and a _ pillar _ is an analogous combination of columns ( see @xcite ) : +    * swapping rows / columns within bands / pillars + * swapping bands / pillars + * rotation @xmath9 of the board by a quarter turn clockwise + * transpose @xmath10 of the board +    fortunately , we can obtain a much smaller set of generators for @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , we need only rotation , transpose , and one row swap : let @xmath11 to be the swap of the third and fourth rows of a shidoku board , then @xmath6 is generated by @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 .",
    "( for example , to swap the first and second columns we can apply @xmath12 , then @xmath11 , then @xmath9 .",
    ") there are relations among these three generators ; the easiest to see being the orders of the generators and a few other relations , such as @xmath13 .",
    "the full presentation of the position symmetry group is @xmath14    we will use the more compact notation @xmath15 .",
    "this is a non - abelian group of order 128 ( see @xcite ) , so the full shidoku symmetry group @xmath7 has order @xmath16 .",
    "note that we have now defined a group of relatively large order , @xmath17 , acting on a set of much smaller order , @xmath18 , to make two orbits , the largest of which is size @xmath19 .",
    "we will say that a group of shidoku symmetries is _ complete _ if its action partitions the set of shidoku boards into the same type 1 and type 2 orbits .",
    "the natural question to ask is whether we can find a complete group of shidoku symmetries with order smaller than @xmath20 ?",
    "the minimum possible order that such a group could have is the size @xmath19 of the largest orbit , so can we find a complete shidoku symmetry group with this minimum order ?",

    "the action of the full group @xmath7 on the set @xmath2 of shidoku boards can be represented with the graph in figure 3 , where each vertex is one of the @xmath21 shidoku boards and each edge corresponds to one of the generators @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath10 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",

    "replacing @xmath9 ( rotation by 90 degrees ) with @xmath48 ( rotation by 180 degrees ) results in the complete minimal symmetry group @xmath41 .",
    "the number of equivalence classes of sudoku boards can be calculated by applying burnside s lemma , which states that if a finite group acts on a set , then the number of orbits is the average size of the fixed point sets for the elements of the group . for shidoku",

    "since there are six ways to select @xmath129 and @xmath130 from the set @xmath131 with @xmath120 , and for each of these choices there is only one way to complete the first block with @xmath117 , there are six @xmath6-nest representatives .    the six @xmath6-nest representatives constructed above are shown in figure 17 and labeled @xmath129@xmath132 based on their lexicographical order .",
