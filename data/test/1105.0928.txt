    "during the last decades it has become clear that our galaxy ( hereafter , the mw ) is a barred system , as first suggested by @xcite .",
    "now we have good evidence from nir photometry @xcite , star counts @xcite , gas kinematics @xcite , microlensing @xcite and dynamical effects near the solar circle @xcite .",
    "several of these works refer to the boxy bulge which ends at a galactic radius of @xmath0  kpc , even though in some models for the observed data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it is clear that the mw bar extends further in the galactic plane .",
    "such a single _ boxy bulge and bar _ structure consisting of a boxy bulge and a planar bar continuation is a characteristic outcome of the secular evolution of barred galaxies @xcite , where the bar eventually buckles and forms a boxy - bulge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after the buckling event the bar resumes its evolution and continues to grow slowly through angular momentum exchange between bar , disk and dark matter halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* mv06 ) .",
    "the mw s _ boxy bulge and bar _ has its long axis in the first quadrant , at an angle @xmath1 with respect to the sun - galactic center line @xcite .",
    "but more recently star count observations extending to greater longitudes have led to surprising results ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b05,c07,c08,c09 ) , confirming an earlier analysis by @xcite : these observations found indications for a separate _ long bar _ with an orientation of @xmath2 , extending from longitude @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( @xmath5  kpc to @xmath6  kpc galactocentric radius ) , and therefore coexisting with the conventional galactic _ boxy bulge and bar _ over a range of radii .",
    "this interpretation , if correct , would dynamically be quite puzzling : two separate rotating bars should align with each other through dynamical coupling in at most a few rotation periods .    in this letter",
    "we show that a separate inferred _ long bar _ does not necessarily follow from the star count data , and we suggest a plausible model to explain these data with a single barred structure whose inner parts represent the boxy bulge .",
    "we also show some predictions for radial velocity distributions that could be used to test this model in the near future .",
    "the simulation used in this work is similar to that published in mv06 and has not been run to match the mw structure .",
    "the code used is ftm  4.4 ( updated version ) from @xcite .",
    "the total number of particles is @xmath7 , distributed initially in an exponential disk with @xmath8 , embedded in a live dark matter halo .",
    "after @xmath0  gyr the bar becomes very strong and buckles , thereby weakening .",
    "later the bar resumes its evolution and grows again , resulting in a prominent _ boxy bulge and bar _ structure .",
    "we consider the simulated galaxy at time @xmath9  gyr , after the boxy bulge has formed and the bar has regrown .",
    "the density distribution for this snapshot is shown in figure  [ fig : snapshot1]_a _ , oriented at an angle @xmath10 with respect to the line from the galactic center to the observer .",
    "the boxy bulge is apparent in figure  [ fig : snapshot1]_b_. the model is scaled so that the end of the planar bar appears just inside longitude @xmath11 as seen from the observer .",
    "the bar length is @xmath12  kpc , and the maximum ellipticity is @xmath13 .",
    "relative to the planar bar , the boxy bulge is @xmath14 larger in @xmath15 in the scaled model than in the mw , as measured by comparing the maxima in the asymmetry map with those from the cobe data @xcite . also both the boxy bulge and the disk",
    "are vertically more extended in the model .",
    "the sun is placed at @xmath16  kpc .    in the face - on view",
    "we can easily identify the _ curved , leading _ ends of the stellar bar . over a period of 1.2  gyr ,",
    "the model shows oscillations from leading through straight to trailing ends and back .",
    "the bar spends 40% of this time in the leading phases .",
    "similar morphology can be seen in other barred simulations in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* model m08 ) and also in some observed galaxies such as ngc  3124 @xcite and ngc  3450 @xcite .",
    "the oscillations between trailing and leading ends of the bar could be related to the oscillations seen in the bar growth in n - body simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may be due to non - linear coupling modes between the bar and spiral arms @xcite .",
    "this topic is beyond the scope of this paper . for comparison",
    "we show a snapshot at a later time in this simulation where the ends of the bar are straight and the spiral arms appear to emerge from them ( figure  [ fig : snapshot2 ] ) .",
    "we apply a similar technique as was used to identify two different barred structures in the mw from star count data ( b05,c07,c08,c09 ) .",
    "we view the projected model as an observer in the disk at @xmath16  kpc distance from the center would see it . to increase the particle resolution , we symmetrize the model vertically and divide the _ ( longitude , latitude)_-(@xmath17)-space into bins of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . then we count particles in each of the corresponding cones and bin these particles in distance modulus , with @xmath20 .",
    "the distance modulus is given by @xmath21)$ ] .",
    "in figure  [ fig : histograms ] we show histograms in @xmath22 for several lines - of - sight . to quantify the distribution of particles with @xmath22 and to assign a distance value to the maximum number counts , we fit a gaussian to the left - most peak , i.e.",
    ", the one nearest to the observer . in the histogram",
    "obtained when looking towards the ends of the bar in the galactic plane ( figure  [ fig : histograms]_a _ ) we can identify three main peaks , one corresponding to the bar , one to a spiral arm in the back , and one to the end of the disk .",
    "the @xmath22-value of the fitted maximum corresponds to the end of the bar , where the bar is flat .",
    "the second histogram for @xmath23 ( figure  [ fig : histograms]_b _ ) shows the distribution of stars in a field well above the plane where the boxy bulge dominates .",
    "the fitted maximum corresponds to a position on the thick line in figure  [ fig : snapshot1 ] at @xmath24 . in the first panel we can clearly identify the particles in the disk , but",
    "in the second showing the higher latitude field , disk particles are absent .",
    "we also show the histogram for @xmath25 ( figure  [ fig : histograms ] _ c _ ) , where we can see the increment in the number of particles with respect to those at @xmath26 , and the displacement of the maximum towards larger distance in comparison with @xmath27 . in the last panel",
    "we show one of the central lines - of - sight @xmath28 for the boxy bulge .    repeating the identification of maxima for all fields in @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ", we produce a similar plot as in c07 .",
    "the distance modulus for each maximum is converted to distance in kpc from the observer s position and plotted in figure  [ fig : posdiagram ] in galactocentric coordinates .",
    "we show such a plot both for the snapshot with leading bar ends ( figure  [ fig : posdiagram]_a _ , corresponding to figure  [ fig : snapshot1 ] ) , and for the snapshot with straight ends ( figure  [ fig : posdiagram]_b _ , corresponding to figure  [ fig : snapshot2 ] ) . in both models ,",
    "the points computed from star counts above the plane ( pink crosses ) follow the heavy line indicating the true orientation angle @xmath24 fixed by us for the model s _ boxy bulge and bar _ , except at the very center and at negative @xmath15 where the maxima are closer to the observer due to tangent point effects .    for lower latitudes ( black crosses ) ,",
    "the points move further back . in both models , for longitudes @xmath31 in the region of the boxy bulge , points in the plane now approximately follow an imaginary line with @xmath32 .",
    "this is due to a volume effect combined with the shallow disk density distribution : @xmath33 .",
    "there is an intermediate region with @xmath34 , where the boxy bulge becomes thinner and transits into the planar bar , and then there is a region , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 to @xmath37  kpc ) , where we can see just particles in the plane . in this region ,",
    "both models differ : the volume effect alone , as illustrated for the bar with the straight ends in figure  [ fig : posdiagram]_b _ , accounts for only half the shift from @xmath24 to @xmath32 . whereas for the snapshot with the leading bar ends ( figure  [ fig : posdiagram]_a _ ) the in - plane points now approximately follow the imaginary @xmath32 line right until the end of the bar is reached .",
    "if we were not aware of the original structure of the model , the results shown in figure  [ fig : posdiagram ] could easily be interpreted as evidence for a model with two structures , one thicker and shorter at @xmath38 and another thinner and longer at @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , the case discussed shows that a separate _ long bar _ is not necessarily implied by the observed star count distributions and that a single _ boxy bulge and bar _ structure is a valid and dynamically simpler interpretation of these data .",
    "several large radial velocity surveys of galactic bulge and disk stars are currently on - going or planned , and we thus provide some predictions for our model .",
    "we scale the average circular velocity curve of the model to the data of @xcite for radii 3 - 4.5 kpc , and then compute the radial velocities at different longitudes as seen from the sun ( assuming @xmath39=250 km / s ; * ? ? ?",
    "we show the mean velocity , dispersion , and particle number vs.  distance modulus in figure  [ fig : velhisto ] for two in - plane positions near the end of the planar bar .",
    "the non - circular motions in the barred models leave a clear signature at @xmath40 compared with the initial axisymmetric disk . in this range",
    "the bar s velocity profile is flat . for the leading - ends bar it has a break at @xmath41 and then increases towards an axisymmetric type of profile . for the straight - ends bar",
    "the break happens earlier @xmath42 and the radial velocities are slightly smaller .",
    "the difference between axisymmetric and bar case is @xmath43  km / s .",
    "the velocity dispersions of both bar models in the two fields are higher by @xmath44  km / s for all @xmath45 .",
    "also note the difference between the star counts with @xmath22 between the three models .",
    "velocities in the boxy bulge are outside the scope of this paper ; they have already been studied with a similar n - body simulation by @xcite and compared with results from the brava survey .",
    "we have analyzed star counts in the inner galaxy using an n - body model which arose from secular evolution of a disk galaxy , a natural mechanism for galaxies like ours .",
    "the bar and buckling instabilities in the stellar disk lead to a boxy bulge which extends to a longer in - plane bar .",
    "the bar couples with the spiral arms in the disk , giving rise alternately to leading , straight or trailing bar ends .    as seen from within the disk at 8 kpc from the center , the maxima of the line - of - sight distance distributions in the galactic plane occur at distances somewhat further than the maxima of the line - of - sight density distributions , due to the volume effect in the star counts . assuming a plausible orientation ( @xmath24 )",
    ", this explains part of the observational signature which was previously used to infer the existence of a second _ long bar_. if in addition we choose a model snapshot where the bar has leading ends , most of the _ long bar _ signature in the star count data can be reproduced . while not made specially to match the mw , this model thus illustrates that the traditional galactic bar ( the boxy bulge ) and the more recently inferred _ long bar _ can plausibly be explained by a single _ boxy bulge and bar _ structure .    to test this",
    "further we have determined the dependence of the mean radial velocity and velocity dispersion on distance modulus in galactic plane fields near the inferred end of the planar bar .",
    "these illustrate the differences between the barred model and an axisymmetric rotating disk , which can be compared with upcoming radial velocity survey data for the inner mw .",
    "future work should also address in more detail the spiral arm - bar interaction which gives rise to the curved ends of the bar , and aim at constructing a more detailed dynamical model allowing us to understand better the structure and evolution of the inner milky way .",
    "we thank ken freeman for helpful discussions about this work .",
    "imv thanks peter hammersley for discussions on the mw ."
