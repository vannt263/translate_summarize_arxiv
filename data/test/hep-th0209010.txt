    "the last four years more understanding has been gained of the interplay between instantons and monopoles in non - abelian gauge theories , based on the ability to construct exact caloron solutions , i.e. instantons at finite temperature for which @xmath3 approaches a constant at spatial infinity  @xcite . this last condition is best expressed by specifying the polyakov loop to approach a constant value at infinity , also called the holonomy .",
    "it is the finite action that demands the field strength to go to zero at infinity , and guarantees the polyakov loop to be independent of the direction in which we approach infinity .",
    "one can parametrize this polyakov loop in terms of its eigenvalues @xmath4 and a gauge rotation @xmath5 , such that = _",
    "x(_0^a_0(x , t)dt)=g^(2i(_1,_2, ",
    ",_n))g , which can be arranged such that @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "this is in the gauge where the gauge fields , assumed to be anti - hermitian matrices taking values in the algebra of @xmath1 , are periodic in the time direction @xmath9 . in our conventions the field strength is given by @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "we will find it convenient to construct the multi - caloron solutions from the adhm - nahm fourier construction  @xcite based on taking instantons in @xmath11 , which periodically repeat in the time direction ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite which uses directly the nahm transformation  @xcite as the starting point for the charge 1 construction ) . to allow for non - trivial holonomy ,",
    "the periodicity is only up to a constant gauge rotation ( which is the holonomy ) . in this so - called algebraic gauge ,",
    "all gauge field components vanish at spatial infinity , and we may approximately superpose these calorons by simply adding the gauge fields .",
    "when each gauge field is periodic up to the same constant gauge transformation , the sum satisfies the same property .",
    "it should be noted that we are not allowed to add gauge fields with different holonomy ; in an _ infinite _ volume the holonomy is fixed by the boundary condition .",
    "as to the topological charge , we recall that in the atiyah - drinfeld - hitchin - manin ( adhm ) construction  @xcite it is supported by gauge singularities ( the algebraic gauge is for this reason also called the singular gauge ) , as opposed to at infinity being a pure gauge with the gauge function having the appropriate winding number . to deal with the gauge singularity of one instanton , when adding the field of the others , one has to smoothly deform the gauge field of the latter to vanish near the gauge singularity .",
    "as long as the singularities are not too close , this can be done without a significant increase in the action . on the lattice",
    "this problem does not occur , when hiding singularities between the meshes of the lattice .",
    "4.1 cm    calorons , however , have an additional feature . when squeezed in the imaginary time direction ( the size @xmath12 becoming bigger than the period @xmath13 ) , they split in constituent monopoles with masses @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) . outside the cores of these monopoles",
    "the gauge field becomes abelian . ignoring the charged components ,",
    "which decay exponentially outside the cores of the constituent monopoles , the field is described in terms of self - dual dirac monopoles .",
    "the singularity of a dirac string can only be avoided by _ not _ neglecting the contributions coming from the charged components , even when far away from the constituents . for a single caloron we would not care , since the dirac string is not seen in gauge invariant quantities .",
    "it does , however , involve a rather subtle interplay between the charged and neutral components of the gauge field in the vicinity of the would - be dirac string  @xcite .",
    "it is this subtle interplay that is disturbed when we add gauge fields of various calorons together .",
    "unlike for the gauge singularity , the combined field will not diverge , but it shows a narrow and steep enhancement at the location of the would - be dirac string as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : string ] , where we added two @xmath16 calorons .",
    "also here one may shield the dirac strings from these tails .",
    "but one always pays the price that the dirac string no longer can be hidden , and carries energy .",
    "let us stress again that these are genuine gauge invariant non - singular features in the configuration , even though they are of course a consequence of our particular way of constructing a superposition .",
    "a visible would - be dirac string presents a formidable obstacle to considering the constituents as independent objects ; they remember to which caloron they belong .",
    "insisting the abelian field far from the constituents to be exactly additive under the approximate superposition leaves us little room for considering other possible superpositions , apart from carefully fine - tuning the charged components of the configuration . solving for the exact self - dual caloron solutions of higher charge we wish to show that a visible dirac string is an artifact of the particular procedure to construct approximate caloron solutions . for the exact charge @xmath0 caloron solutions we expect @xmath17 constituents and from the point of view of the parameter space",
    "these can be expected to be independent ( as long the constituents do not get too close together ) .    3.0 cm    in this paper we develop the formalism and give exact solutions for a class of axially symmetric solutions .",
    "for @xmath16 an example of such an exact solution with charge 2 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : wellsep ] .",
    "we compare the exact solution ( left ) , with the one obtained by adding two charge 1 calorons , showing the would - be dirac strings ( middle ) and with the exact abelian solution determined from ( self - dual ) dirac monopoles placed at the location of the constituents ( right ) .",
    "indeed , the would - be dirac strings are no longer visible for the exact non - abelian solution .",
    "this gives us good reasons to expect that moving away from the requirement of axial symmetry , the exact solutions will exhibit the constituent monopoles as independent objects .",
    "this is an important prerequisite for attempting to formulate the long distance features of qcd in terms of these monopoles .",
    "non - linearities will remain important when constituents overlap , like for instantons at zero - temperature , as will be illustrated through suitable examples .",
    "our results can also be used to extract information on multi - monopole solutions . in the charge 1 case",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that sending one of the constituents to infinity one is left with exact monopole solutions . perhaps somewhat surprisingly",
    ", it has been notoriously difficult to construct approximate superpositions of magnetic monopoles in such a way the interaction energy decreases with their separation . within our approach",
    "this is due to the difficulty ( particularly when sending some constituents to infinity ) in keeping dirac strings hidden .",
    "it would therefore still be important to find approximate superpositions that achieve this .",
    "nevertheless , it shows how subtle it is to consider abelian fields as embedded in non - abelian ones .",
    "there is much more to t hooft s abelian projection  @xcite than meets the eye at first glance .",
    "the rest of the paper will be organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we formulate the fourier analysis of the adhm data for calorons of higher charge .",
    "this allows us in sect .",
    "2.1 to relate to the nahm equations , providing the connection between the adhm and nahm data .",
    "the nahm equation for charge @xmath0 calorons  @xcite expresses self - duality of dual @xmath18 gauge fields on a circle , but with singularities . in sect .",
    "2.2 we introduce the `` master '' green s function in terms of which the gauge field ( sect .  2.3 ) and the action density ( sect .  2.4 ) can be explicitly computed , relying heavily on some beautiful results  @xcite derived in the context of the adhm construction .",
    "this can all be achieved without explicitly solving the nahm equation . in sect .  3 we will",
    ", however , solve it for some special cases with axial symmetry .",
    "there we also illustrate some interesting features that appear when constituents overlap , similar to what was observed at zero temperature  @xcite .    sect .  4",
    "is devoted to the far - field limit ( related to the high - temperature limit ) , where up to exponential corrections only the abelian component of the field survives .",
    "again , expressions can be derived without explicitly solving the nahm equation .",
    "we apply the formalism to the exact axially symmetric solutions in sect .  4.3.1 , where we prove that in the far - field region they are in a precise sense described by ( self - dual )",
    "dirac monopoles , which is conjectured to be the case for any exact solution .",
    "we end in sect .  5 with a discussion of lattice results that have been obtained by various groups , some open questions and suggestions for future studies .",
    "in constructing the higher charge caloron solutions similar steps are followed as for charge 1 .",
    "we distinguish two constructions , @xmath19 based on quaternions , and @xmath1 based on complex spinors . with @xmath20 , this implies that for @xmath16 two constructions are possible .",
    "for @xmath21 it was easily shown these are identical , but for @xmath22 this is more complicated due to the quadratic adhm constraint  @xcite which can not be solved in all generality . since the essential part of the construction that employs the impurity scattering technique is identical in both approaches , we will give a unified presentation .    the @xmath1 adhm formalism for charge @xmath0 instantons  @xcite",
    "employs a @xmath0 dimensional vector @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a two - component spinor in the @xmath25 representation of @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath26 can be seen as a @xmath27 complex matrix .",
    "in addition one has four complex hermitian @xmath28 matrices @xmath29 , combined into a @xmath30 complex matrix @xmath31 , using the unit quaternions @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are the pauli matrices . with some abuse of notation , we often write @xmath35 . together",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath36 constitute the @xmath37 dimensional matrix @xmath38 , to which is associated a complex @xmath39 dimensional normalized zero mode vector @xmath40 , ( x)= ( + b(x)),b(x)=b - x,^(x)v(x)=0,v^(x)v(x)=_n . here",
    "the quaternion @xmath41 denotes the position ( a @xmath28 unit matrix is implicit ) and @xmath40 can be solved explicitly in terms of the adhm data by v(x)=(-_n + u(x))^-,u(x)= ( b^-x^)^-1^,(x)=_n+u^(x)u(x ) , as @xmath42 is an @xmath43 positive hermitian matrix , its square root @xmath44 is well - defined .",
    "the gauge field is given by a_(x)=v^(x)_v(x)=^-(x)(u^(x ) _",
    "u(x))^-(x)+^(x)_^-(x ) .",
    "[ eq : aadhm ] the @xmath45 adhm formalism for charge @xmath0 instantons  @xcite employs also a @xmath0 dimensional vector @xmath23 , where now @xmath46 is a quaternion ( 4 real parameters ) .",
    "again , @xmath26 can be seen as an @xmath47 complex matrix ( but with @xmath48 real , as opposed to complex , parameters ) .",
    "now the four @xmath28 matrices @xmath29 are required to be real and symmetric , still to be combined into a @xmath30 complex matrix @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath49 dimensional matrix @xmath38 is constructed as before .",
    "it is immediately obvious that now @xmath42 is proportional to @xmath50 , simplifying the expression for the gauge field to a_(x)=v^(x)_v(x)=(u^(x)_u(x))/(x ) .",
    "for @xmath51 to be a self - dual connection , @xmath38 has to satisfy the quadratic adhm constraint , which states that @xmath52 ( considered as a @xmath28 complex quaternionic matrix ) has to commute with the quaternions , or equivalently ^(x)(x)=_0f^-1_x,[eq : adhmconstr ] defining @xmath53 as a hermitian ( resp .",
    "symmetric ) @xmath28 green s function .",
    "the ity follows by computing the curvature f_=2 ^ -(x)u^(x)_f_x u(x)^-(x ) , making essential use of the fact that @xmath53 commutes with the quaternions , and @xmath54}$ ] being  ( @xmath55}$ ] is ) .",
    "the quadratic constraint can be formulated as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , and one obtains |_b_b_+_a _",
    "2(_a^)= 0,[eq : radhmcon ] where @xmath58 is the spinorial trace . note that this implies that @xmath59 is traceless for @xmath60 .    to count the number of instanton parameters we observe that the transformation @xmath61 , @xmath62 , with @xmath63 ( resp .",
    "@xmath64 ) leaves the gauge field and the adhm constraint untouched . taking this symmetry into account ,",
    "one checks the dimension of the instanton moduli space to be @xmath65 dimensional .",
    "we have @xmath65 and @xmath66 real parameters from @xmath26 and @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath67 symmetry removes @xmath68 real parameters and finally the quadratic adhm constraint gives @xmath69 real equations . on the other hand , for the quaternionic construction",
    "there are @xmath48 and @xmath70 parameters from @xmath26 and @xmath29 , of which @xmath71 are removed by the @xmath72 symmetry , and the quadratic adhm constraint gives @xmath73 equations .",
    "global gauge transformations are realized by @xmath74 , with @xmath75 and are here included in the parameter count . for calorons with non - trivial holonomy the dimension of the gauge invariant parameter space",
    "is minimally reduced by @xmath76 ( maximal symmetry breaking ) and maximally by @xmath77 ( trivial holonomy ) .",
    "we note that for @xmath16 the quadratic adhm constraint and symmetry of the adhm data for high charge differ considerably . for the caloron we have to deal in a sense with infinite topological charge , but finite within each ( imaginary ) time interval of length @xmath13 .",
    "this infinity is resolved by fourier transformation , relating it to the nahm formalism  @xcite , but the difference between the @xmath67 and @xmath72 symmetries ( the infinity is moved to making these gauge symmetries local ) remains , as well as of course the nature of the nahm data ( the fourier transformation of the adhm data ) .",
    "henceforth we put @xmath78 , which can always be achieved by a rescaling .    like for charge one  @xcite the caloron with polyakov loop @xmath79 at infinity",
    "is built out of a periodic array of instantons , twisted by @xmath79 .",
    "this is implemented in the adhm formalism by requiring ( suppressing color and spinor indices , respectively quaternion indices ) u_pk+k+a(x+1)=u_pk+a(x)_^-1 [ eq : ucocyc ] with @xmath80 ( the fourier index ) , and @xmath81 ( associated to the non - abelian nature of the nahm data ) . using that @xmath82 ,",

    "this has been implemented in @xmath16 lattice monte carlo studies as well , where @xmath79 was set to the average value of the polyakov loop , appropriate for the temperature at which the simulations were performed  @xcite .",
    "cooling was applied to find calorons , including those at higher charge .",
    "apart from the configurations that in the continuum would be exactly self - dual , the lattice allows one to also consider configurations in which both self - dual and anti - selfdual lumps appear .",
