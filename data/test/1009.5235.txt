    "radio sources are divided into two distinct morphological groups of objects : fris and friis @xcite .",
    "there is a relatively sharp luminosity boundary between them at low frequency .",
    "the nature of the fr - division is still an open issue , as are the details of the evolutionary process in which younger and smaller gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) and compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources become large scale radio structures .",
    "it is unclear whether frii objects evolve to become fris , or whether a division has already occurred amongst css sources and some of these then become fris and some friis .",
    "a majority of css sources known to date have high radio luminosities and , if unbeamed , have frii structures .",
    "it seems reasonable to suspect that some of the csss with lower radio luminosity could be the progenitors of less luminous fri objects .",
    "the gps and css sources form a well - defined class of compact radio objects and are considered to be entirely contained within the host galaxy . during their evolution",
    "the radio jets start to cross the ism and try to leave the host galaxy .",
    "the interaction with the ism can be very strong in gps / css sources @xcite and it seems to be a crucial point in the evolution of radio sources .",
    "recently developed models @xcite show that all sources start out with a frii morphology .",
    "as the radio source expands the interaction with the dense environment of the host galaxy can disrupt jets and change their morphology to fris or hybrid objects @xcite .",
    "some sources with disrupted jets can fade away @xcite .",
    "detection of several candidates for dying compact sources supports this view @xcite .",
    "what s more , the activity of compact radio sources can be an episodic event @xcite , like in the case of large scale radio objects .    as recently suggested by @xcite",
    "there could be a connection between the existence of short - lived compact radio sources and the intermittent activity of the central engine caused by a radiation pressure instability within an accretion disc .",
    "according to the authors a radio source powered by a short - lived outburst of the central activity is not able to escape from the host galaxy unless the active phase lasts longer than @xmath2@xmath3  years .",
    "it is then likely that among the low luminosity compact ( llc ) sources we can find objects affected during their evolution either by a strong interaction with the ism , which changes their morphology and luminosity , or by the instability of the accretion disc .    in this paper",
    "we present the l - band and c - band merlin observations of 44 low luminosity css sources selected from the first survey .",
    "this is a new approach since the main criterion used for selection was not flux density but luminosity of the objects .",
    "the selection criteria caused that approximately one third of the css sources from the new sample have a value of radio luminosity lower than the luminosity boundary found for fr sources @xcite , which means that they are compact young sources with luminosities comparable to fris ( fig .",
    "[ sample_plot ] ) .",
    "the goal of this project is to study the properties of low luminosity compact ( llc ) objects and the evolution of the compact object population .",
    "our previous multifrequency observations of css sources have shown that some of the small - scale objects can be strong candidates for compact faders @xcite .",
    "this finding supports the idea that there exist a group of short - lived radio objects that has been largely neglected to date .",
    "using the final release of first , combined with the gb6 survey at 4.85ghz we looked for unresolved , isolated sources i.e. more compact than first beam ( 54 ) and surrounded by an empty field ( we adopted 1  as a radius of that field ) .",
    "we required that the redshifts of the objects identified with radio sources are known and we extracted them from ned and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "consequently , we were able to impose the low power criterion .",
    "the limit on flux density was chosen in order to produce a sample of manageable size , but also to exclude objects with flux densities too low to be detected in snapshot observations . eventually , the selection criteria were as follows :    * low luminosity criterion : @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "( for @xmath6=100@xmath7 , @xmath8=0.5 ; in this paper we use another cosmology ) ; * flux density criterion : 70mjy @xmath9 1jy ; * spectral index criterion : @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "description of the columns : ( 1 ) source name ; ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) source coordinates ( j2000 ) ; ( 4 ) redshift ; @xmath12 - photometric redshift taken form the literature or from the sdss ; @xmath13 - this is a new value from the sdss ; we adopt @xmath14 for sources with unknown redshift ; ( 5 ) total flux density at 1.4ghz extracted from first ; ( 6 ) log of the radio luminosity at 1.4ghz ; ( 7 ) total flux density at 4.85ghz extracted from gb6 ; ( 8) log of the radio luminosity at 4.85ghz ; ( 9 ) largest angular size ( las ) ; ( 10 ) largest linear size ( lls ) calculated based on the largest angular size measurements on resolved structure taken from the literature .",
    "data are taken from @xcite sample ( first part of the table ) and @xcite .",
    "there is a small overlap of this two samples that is why the overlaping sources are included only in a first part of the table ."
