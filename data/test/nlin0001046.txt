    "rapid progress in the design and manufacture of optical fiber systems is a result of worldwide demand for ultra - high bit - rate optical communications .",
    "this explains the growing interest of the soliton community in soliton - based optical fiber communication systems .",
    "this area of research was considerably advanced in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the most remarkable results include the application of the concept of the dispersion management to _ temporal optical solitons _ and soliton - based optical transmission systems , and the discovery of the so - called _ dispersion managed soliton_. high - speed optical communications require effective components such as high - performance broadband computer networks that can be developed by employing the concept of the bit - parallel - wavelength ( bpw ) pulse transmission that offers many of the advantages of both parallel fiber ribbon cable and conventional wavelength - division - multiplexing ( wdm ) systems  @xcite .",
    "expanding development in the study of the soliton fiber systems has been observed in parallel with impressive research on their spatial counterparts , optical self - trapped beams or _",
    "spatial optical solitons_. one of the key concepts in this field came from the theory of multi - frequency wave mixing and cascaded nonlinearities where a nonlinear phase shift is produced as a result of the parametric wave interaction  @xcite .",
    "in all such systems , the nonlinear interaction between the waves of two ( or more ) frequencies is the major physical effect that can support coupled - mode multi - frequency solitary waves .",
    "the examples of temporal and spatial solitons mentioned above have one common feature : they involve the study of solitary waves in multi - component nonlinear models .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to overview several different physical examples of multi - mode and/or multi - frequency solitary waves that occur for the pulse or beam propagation in nonlinear optical fibers and waveguides . for these purposes , we select three different cases : multi - wavelength solitary waves in bit - parallel - wavelength optical fiber links , multi - colour spatial solitons due to multistep cascading in optical waveguides with quadratic nonlinearities , and quasiperiodic solitons in the fibonacci superlattices .",
    "we believe these examples display both the diversity and richness of the multi - mode soliton systems , and they will allow further progress to be made in the study of nonlinear waves in multi - component nonintegrable physical models .",
    "because the phenomenon of the long - distance propagation of _ temporal optical solitons _ in optical fibers  @xcite is known to a much broader community of researchers in optics and nonlinear physics , first we emphasize _ the difference between temporal and spatial solitary waves_. indeed , for a long time stationary beam propagation in planar waveguides has been considered somewhat similar to the pulse propagation in fibers .",
    "this approach is based on the so - called _ spatio - temporal analogy _ in wave propagation , meaning that the propagation coordinate @xmath0 is treated as the evolution variable and the spatial beam profile along the transverse direction in waveguides , is similar to the temporal pulse profile in fibers .",
    "this analogy is based on a simple notion that both beam evolution and pulse propagation can be described by the cubic nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation .",
    "however , contrary to the widely accepted opinion , there is a crucial difference between temporal and spatial solitons . indeed , in the case of the nonstationary pulse propagation in fibers , the operation wavelength is usually selected near the zero point of the group - velocity dispersion .",
    "this means that the absolute value of the fiber dispersion is small enough to be compensated by a weak nonlinearity such as that produced by the ( very weak ) kerr effect in optical fibers which leads to a relative nonlinearity - induced change in the refractive index .",
    "therefore , nonlinearity in such systems is always weak and it should be well modeled by a cubic nls equation which is known to be integrable by means of the inverse - scattering technique . however , for very short ( e.g. , fs ) pulses the cubic nls equation describing the long - distance propagation of pulses should be corrected to include additional terms that would account for such effects as higher - order dispersion , raman scattering , etc .",
    "all such corrections can be taken into account with the help of the perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "thus , in fibers nonlinear effects are weak and they become important only when dispersion is small ( near the zero - dispersion point ) affecting the pulse propagation over large distances ( of order of hundreds of meters or even kilometers ) .",
    "the situation changes dramatically when we consider the propagation of multi - wavelength pulses with almost equal group velocities .",
    "the corresponding model is described by a nonintegrable and rather complicated system of coupled nls equations , which we briefly discuss below .    in contrary to the pulse propagation in optical fibers ,",
    "the physics underlying the stationary beam propagation in planar waveguides and bulk media is different . in this case",
    "an optical beam is generated by a continuous wave ( cw ) source and it is time independent .",
    "however , when the beam evolves with the propagation distance @xmath0 , it diffracts in the transverse spatial directions .",
    "then , a nonlinear change in the refractive index should compensate for the beam spreading caused by diffraction _ which is not a small effect_. that is why to observe spatial solitons as self - trapped optical beams , much larger nonlinearities are usually required , and very often such nonlinearities are not of the kerr type ( e.g. they saturate at higher intensities ) .",
    "this leads to the models of generalized nonlinearities with the properties of solitary waves different from those described by the integrable cubic nls equation .",
    "propagation distances involved in the phenomenon of the beam self - focusing and spatial soliton propagation are of the order of millimeters or centimeters .",
    "to achieve such large nonlinearities , one needs to use the optical materials with large nonlinearity - induced refractive index .",
    "one of the possible way to overcome this difficulty is to use the so - called _ cascaded nonlinearities _ of noncentrosymmetric optical materials where nonlinear effects are accumulated due to parametric wave interaction under the condition of the wave phase matching .",
    "such parametric wave - mixing effects generate novel classes of spatial optical solitons where resonant parametric coupling between the envelopes of two ( or more ) beams of different frequencies supports stable spatially localised waves even in a bulk medium ( see details in ref .",
    "it is this kind of multi - component solitary waves that we discuss below .",
    "a growing demand for high - speed computer communications requires an effective and inexpensive computer interconnection .",
    "one attractive alternative to the conventional wdm systems is bpw single - mode fiber optics links for very high bandwidth computer communications  @xcite .",
    "they differ from the wdm schemes in that no parallel to serial conversion is necessary , and parallel pulses are launched simultaneously on different wavelengths .",
    "when the pulses of different wavelengths are transmitted simultaneously , the cross - phase modulation can produce an interesting _ pulse shepherding effect _",
    "@xcite , when a strong ( `` shepherd '' ) pulse enables the manipulation and control of pulses co - propagating on different wavelengths in a multi - channel optical fiber link .    to describe the simultaneous transmission of @xmath1 different wavelengths in a nonlinear optical fiber , we follow the standard derivation  @xcite and obtain a system of @xmath1 coupled nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations @xmath2 ) : @xmath3 { \\displaystyle \\qquad      + \\chi_j \\left ( |a_j|^2 + 2 \\sum_{m \\neq j } |a_m|^2",

    "the solution b is close to an exact sech - type solution at @xmath58 ( described above ) for @xmath45 , whereas the solution a is close to that approximately described in the linear limit in the vicinity of a bifurcation point .",
    "importantly , for different values of the parameters @xmath59 , the uppermost bifurcation point for this branch ( open circle in fig . [",
    "fig : bpw1 ] ) is not predicted by a simple linear theory and , due to the nonlinear mode coupling , it gets shifted from the branch of the central - wavelength soliton ( straight line ) to a two - mode branch ( 0 + 1 + 2 ) ( thick solid curve ) .    as a result , if we start on the right end of the horizontal branch and follow the lowest branches of the total power @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bpw1 ] , we pass the following sequence of the soliton families and bifurcation points : @xmath61 . if the modal parameters are selected closer to each other , the first two links of _ the bifurcation cascade _ disappear ( i.e. the corresponding bifurcation points merge ) , and the four - mode soliton bifurcates directly from the central - wavelength pulse , as predicted by the linear theory .",
    "note however that the sequence and location of the bifurcation points is a function of the cross - section of the parameter space @xmath51 , and the results presented above correspond to the choice @xmath62 .    the qualitative picture of the cascading bifurcations preserves for other values of @xmath1 .",

    "most of the studies of cascading effects employ parametric wave mixing processes with a single phase - matching and , as a result , two - step cascading  @xcite .",
    "for example , the two - step cascading associated with type i second - harmonic generation ( shg ) includes the generation of the second harmonic ( @xmath67 ) followed by reconstruction of the fundamental wave through the down - conversion frequency mixing ( dfm ) process ( @xmath68 ) .",

    "then , to address this problem analytically , approximate solutions can be used , such as those found with the help of the variational method  @xcite .",
    "however , the different types of the variational ansatz used do not provide a very good approximation for the soliton profile at all @xmath114 .",
    "for our eigenvalue problem ( [ eq_eigen ] ) , the function @xmath148 defines parameters of the guided modes and , in order to obtain accurate results , it should be calculated as close as possible to the exact solutions found numerically . to resolve this difficulty , below we suggest a novel `` almost exact '' solution that _ would allow to solve analytically many of the problems involving quadratic solitons _",

    "first , we notice that from the exact solution at @xmath146 and the asymptotic result for large @xmath114 , @xmath151 , it follows that the sh component @xmath148 of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_2 ] ) remains almost self - similar for @xmath152 .",
    "thus , we look for the sh field in the form @xmath153 , where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are to be defined .",
    "the solution for @xmath156 should be consistent with this choice of the shape for sh , and it is defined by the first ( linear for @xmath126 ) equation of the system ( [ eq_2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can take @xmath126 in the form of the lowest guided mode , @xmath157 , that corresponds to an effective waveguide @xmath148 . by matching the asymptotics of these trial functions with those defined directly from eqs .",
    "( [ eq_2 ] ) at small and large @xmath158 , we obtain the following solution , @xmath159 @xmath160 here , the third relation allows us to find @xmath154 for arbitrary @xmath114 as a solution of a cubic equation , and then to find all other parameters as functions of @xmath114 . for mismatches in the interval @xmath161",
    ", the parameter values change monotonically in the regions : @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 .",
    "it is really amazing that the analytical solution  ( [ eq_s]),([eq_p ] ) provides _ an excellent approximation _ for the profiles of the two - wave parametric solitons found numerically , with the relative errors not exceeding 1%3% for stable solitons",
    "( e.g. when @xmath165 ) . as a matter of fact",

    "( [ eq_s ] ) and  ( [ eq_p ] ) as an _",

    "( [ eq_s ] ) and  ( [ eq_p ] ) , the fh component and the self - consistent effective waveguide ( created by the sh field ) have approximately the same stationary transverse profiles as for one - component solitons in a kerr - like medium with power - law nonlinear response  @xcite . for @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) and @xmath168 ( @xmath169 )",
    "our general expressions reduce to the known analytical solutions , and the fh profile is exactly the same as that for solitons in quadratic and cubic kerr media , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the strength of self - action for quadratic solitons depends on the normalized phase mismatch @xmath114 and , in general , the beam dynamics for parametric wave mixing can be very different from that observed in kerr - type media .",
    "now , the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq_eigen ] ) can be readily solved analytically .",

    "@xmath103 , the dependence has a simple form : @xmath182 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "because a two - wave soliton creates an induced waveguide parametrically coupled to its guided modes of the orthogonal polarization , the dynamics of the guided modes _ may differ drastically _ from that of conventional waveguides based on the kerr - type nonlinearities .",
    "figures   show two examples of the evolution of guided modes . in the first example",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig : wave_w](a - c ) ] , a weak fundamental mode is amplified via parametric interaction with a soliton waveguide , and the mode experiences a strong power exchange with the orthogonally polarized fh component through the sh field .",

    "the resulting effect can be interpreted as a power exchange between two guided modes of orthogonal polarizations in a waveguide created by the sh field . in the second example , the propagation is stable [ see fig .  [",

    "the dpm processes and the soliton waveguiding effects described above , we can suggest two general methods .",
    "the first method is based on the use of _ two commensurable periods _ of the quasi - phase - matched ( qpm ) periodic grating . indeed , to achieve dpm",
    ", we can employ the first - order qpm for one parametric process , and the third - order qpm , for the other parametric process .",
    "taking , as an example , the parameters for linbo@xmath193 and aa - s @xmath194 and bb - s @xmath195 processes @xcite , we find two points for dpm at about 0.89 @xmath196 m and 1.25 @xmath196 m .",
    "this means that a single qpm grating can provide simultaneous phase - matching for two parametric processes .",
    "for such a configuration , we obtain @xmath197 or , interchanging the polarization components , @xmath198 . the second method to achieve the conditions of dpm processes",
    "is based on the idea of _ quasi - periodic qpm grating _",
    "specifically , fibonacci optical superlattices provide an effective way to achieve phase - matching at _ several incommensurable periods _ allowing multi - frequency harmonic generation in a single structure .",
    "we describe the properties of such structures in the next section .",
    "for many years , solitary waves have been considered as _ coherent localized modes _ of nonlinear systems , with particle - like dynamics quite dissimilar to the irregular and stochastic behavior observed for chaotic systems  @xcite . however , about 20 years ago akira hasegawa , while developing a statistical description of the dynamics of an ensemble of plane waves in nonlinear strongly dispersive plasmas , suggested the concept of a localized envelope of random phase waves  @xcite . because of the relatively high powers required for generating self - localized random waves , this notion remained a theoretical curiosity until recently , when the possibility to generate spatial optical solitons by a partially incoherent source was discovered in a photorefractive medium  @xcite .",
    "the concept of incoherent solitons can be compared with a different problem : the propagation of a soliton through a spatially disordered medium . indeed , due to random scattering on defects , the phases of the individual components forming a soliton experience random fluctuations , and the soliton itself becomes _ partially incoherent _ in space and time . for a low - amplitude wave ( linear regime )",
    "spatial incoherence is known to lead to a fast decay . as a result",
    ", the transmission coefficient vanishes exponentially with the length of the system , the phenomenon known as anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "however , for large amplitudes ( nonlinear regime ) , when the nonlinearity length is much smaller than the anderson localization length , a soliton can propagate almost unchanged through a disordered medium as predicted theoretically in 1990 @xcite and recently verified experimentally  @xcite .    these two important physical concepts , spatial self - trapping of light generated by an incoherent source in a homogeneous medium , and suppression of anderson localization for large - amplitude waves in spatially disordered media , both result from the effect of strong nonlinearity .",
    "when the nonlinearity is sufficiently strong it acts as _ an effective phase - locking mechanism _ by producing a large frequency shift of the different random - phase components , and thereby introducing _ an effective order _ into an incoherent wave packet , thus enabling the formation of localized structures . in other words ,",
    "both phenomena correspond to the limit when the ratio of the nonlinearity length to the characteristic length of ( spatial or temporal ) fluctuations is small . in the opposite limit , when this ratio is large , the wave propagation is practically linear .    below we show that , at least for aperiodic inhomogeneous structures , solitary waves can exist in the intermediate regime in the form of _ quasiperiodic nonlinear localized modes_. as an example , we consider shg and nonlinear beam propagation in _ fibonacci optical superlattices _ , and demonstrate numerically the possibility of spatial self - trapping of quasiperiodic waves whose envelope amplitude varies quasiperiodically , while still maintaining a stable , well - defined spatially localized structure , _ a quasiperiodic envelope soliton_.      we consider the interaction of a fundamental wave with the frequency @xmath69 ( fh ) and its sh in a slab waveguide with quadratic ( or @xmath66 ) nonlinearity . assuming the @xmath66 susceptibility to be modulated and the nonlinearity to be of the same order as diffraction , we write the dynamical equations in the form @xmath199     { \\displaystyle i\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z } + \\frac{1}{4 }     \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2 } + d(z ) u^2 e^{i\\beta z } =   0 , }    \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath200 and @xmath201 are the slowly varying envelopes of the fh and sh , respectively .",

    "@xcite , who measured multi - colour shg with energy conversion efficiencies of @xmath210 .",
    "this quasiperiodic optical superlattice in litao@xmath193 can also be used for efficient direct third harmonic generation @xcite .",

    "this can be done analytically for periodic qpm gratings  @xcite . however , for the quasiperiodic gratings we have to resolve to numerical simulations .",

    "first , we study the small - amplitude limit when a weak fh is injected with a low amplitude .",

    "the sh is generated , but now the nonlinearity is so strong that it leads to self - focusing and mutual self - trapping of the two fields , resulting in a spatially localized two - component soliton , despite the continuous scattering of the quasiperiodic qpm grating .",
    "it is important to notice that the two - component localized beam created due to the self - trapping effect is quasiperiodic by itself . as a matter of fact , after an initial transient its amplitude oscillates in phase with the quasiperiodic qpm modulation @xmath208 .",

    "our numerical results show that the quasiperiodic envelope solitons can be generated for a broad range of the phase - mismatch @xmath238 .",
    "the amplitude and width of the solitons depend on the effective mismatch , which is the separation between @xmath238 and the nearest strong peak @xmath235 in the fibonacci qpm grating spectrum [ see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : transmission ] we show the transmission coefficients and the beam widths at the output of the crystal versus the intensity of the fh input beam , for a variety of @xmath238-values .",
    "these dependencies clearly illustrate the universality of the generation of localised modes for varying strength of nonlinearity , i.e. a quasiperiodic soliton is generated only for sufficiently high amplitudes .",
