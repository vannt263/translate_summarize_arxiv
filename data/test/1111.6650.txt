    "frequency - selective pulses have widespread utility in magnetic resonance and have motivated significant efforts towards their design . in many useful cases , the resulting methodologies can achieve the best approximation to the ideal rectangular profile for spin response as a function of frequency offset .",
    "however , in all of these approaches to pulse design , performance criteria that can be included in the design protocol are restricted either by analytical procedures of highly specific scope or by numerical methods that are limited by the efficiency of the optimizations employed . as a result",
    ", pulse response is typically optimized only for the nominal ideal rf pulse values .",
    "in addition , although the length of pulses required for narrowband applications can significantly reduce their effectiveness when relaxation times are comparable to the pulse length @xcite , the solution to the problem  selective pulses which are less sensitive to relaxation effects  can also be demanding for standard design methods @xcite .    to make these design challenges tractable ,",
    "the space of possible pulse shapes is often reduced by forcing the solution to be a member of a particular family of functional forms ( for example , finite fourier series ) .",
    "thus , potentially , there are important solutions that are missed .    over the past decade",
    ", we have shown optimal control theory to be an efficient and powerful method that can be applied to a wide range of challenging nmr pulse design problems without restricting the space of possible solutions @xcite .",
    "it is capable of designing broadband pulses @xcite and selective pulses @xcite that are simultaneously tolerant to rf inhomogeneity and relaxation effects , which we develop further in the present work .",
    "optimal control ( including similar , related optimization procedures ) was originally introduced into magnetic resonance for the design of band - selective pulses , primarily for imaging @xcite .",
    "it was quickly supplanted by the efficient shinnar - leroux ( slr ) algorithm @xcite , which establishes a correspondence between frequency - selective pulse design and digital filter design .",
    "there are fast , non - iterative algorithms for the ideal filter and , hence , the ideal pulse .",
    "unfortunately , the algorithm does not accommodate additional criteria , such as tolerance to rf inhomogeneity ( included in some of the earliest optimal control - related approaches @xcite ) or relaxation effects .",
    "in addition , the most applicable and widely used form of the algorithm derives pulses which produce a specific linear phase dispersion in the spectral response .",
    "pulses producing no phase dispersion , suitable for spectroscopy , are more problematic for the slr algorithm .",
    "we first provide an overview of well - known issues relevant to selective pulse design , since there is considerably less freedom in the choice of parameters compared to broadband pulses .",
    "for example , in designing broadband pulses , we have shown @xcite there is at best only a marginal relation between the maximum amplitude , @xmath2 , of a pulse and the achievable excitation or inversion bandwidth , as long as the pulse length , , is allowed to increase sufficiently . alternatively",
    ", increasing @xmath2  for a given  can improve performance for a given bandwidth or increase the bandwidth .",
    "there can also be innumerable broadband pulses that provide approximately equal performance for a given @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and bandwidth .",
    "selective pulses are far more constrained , with a well - known relation between the selective bandwidth and , and much tighter limits on the choice of @xmath2  for a given product of bandwidth and @xcite . we provide only a simple overview of the optimal control methodology , emphasizing the modifications necessary for the present work .",
    "the basic algorithm for optimizing pulse performance over a range of resonance offsets and rf inhomogeneity is described fully in @xcite .",
    "details related to incorporating relaxation @xcite and specific dispersion in the phase of the final magnetization@xcite , which we refer to as the phase slope , are provided in the associated references .",
    "values of the phase slope , @xmath4 , at each offset @xcite characterize the net phase dispersion that accumulates during a pulse of length @xmath3 .",
    "the phase slope is defined relative to the net precession of transverse magnetization that would be produced solely by chemical - shift evolution during the same time interval , @xmath3 . a pulse that produces focused magnetization of fixed phase for",
    "all spins in the offset range of interest would have constant @xmath5 ( i.e. , a self - refocused pulse ) .",
    "many selective pulses are symmetric , @xmath6 pulses .",
    "the symmetry of the resulting pulse provides an advantage in the development of various algorithms used in selective pulse design , such as slr , inverse scattering @xcite , polychromatic , and stereographic projection @xcite .",
    "in fact , the standard form of the slr algorithm @xcite can only generate linear phase of this value .",
    "sophisticated algorithms allowing for more general phase in selective pulses are described in the literature @xcite , but they are specific to this particular performance factor and can not include tolerance to variations in other experimentally important parameters .",
    "by contrast , including additional performance criteria , such as a general phase response , is straightforward for optimal control .",
    "initial magnetization @xmath7 is driven by the rf controls to a final magnetization @xmath8 that is defined for each resonance offset in the desired range . to excite transverse magnetization of linear phase slope @xmath4",
    ", we consider target states for each offset @xmath9 in the excitation bandwidth of the form @xcite @xmath10 \\label{f(r)}\\ ] ] choosing @xmath11 gives a linear phase slope , but any function can be considered to define a useful target phase , such as quadratic or higher order .",
    "selective excitation most simply requires changing the target to @xmath12 $ ] for offsets outside the desired bandwidth . in principle",
    ", this stopband includes an infinite range of frequencies that must therefore be truncated at some chosen value .",
    "we found as a practical matter that choosing the stopband to be @xmath13 times the passband width was sufficient to eliminate excitation at higher frequencies for the pulse parameters used here .",
    "this value can easily be adjusted upwards if necessary , or , alternatively , high - frequency components of the resulting pulse determined from fourier analysis can be deleted after verifying they have no significant effect on the passband excitation .",
    "in addition , since the ideal rectangular offset response can not be excited by a finite - length pulse , there must be a transition connecting the excitation frequencies to the nulled frequencies .",
    "this is typically defined in terms of design parameters for finite impulse response ( fir ) filters .",
    "an overview of the issues relevant to our optimal control implementation follows .      for design conditions employing ideal rf in the absence of relaxation , selective pulse performance",
    "is completely determined by the desired passband width @xmath14 , pulse length @xmath3 , transition width @xmath15 joining the passband and stopband , and residual signal fluctuation or ripple @xmath16 and @xmath17 about the ideal target amplitude for the passband and stopband , respectively .",
    "the passband frequency @xmath18 and stopband frequency @xmath19 are defined where the magnitude of the magnetization response becomes less than the associated fluctuations @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as illustrated in fig.1 ( adopted from ref .",
    "the frequency where the amplitude drops to one - half is approximately the average of these two frequencies .",
    "the full width of the filter is defined as twice this value , giving a bandwidth @xmath22 and a fractional transition width @xmath23 .",
    "more specifically ( and again emphasizing the design conditions stated at the beginning of the section ) , selective pulse performance is constrained by relations for optimal fir filters of the form @xmath24 in terms of an empirically derived function @xmath25 @xcite . for a given value of @xmath26 ,",
    "smaller ( larger ) @xmath16 gives larger ( smaller ) @xmath17 .",
    "alternatively , for fixed @xmath16 or fixed @xmath17 , values of @xmath27 increase as @xmath17 or @xmath16 , respectively , decrease .",
    "flexibility in selective pulse design is thus purchased at the cost of trade - offs among bandwidth , pulse length , transition width , and ripple amplitudes . choosing any four of the set determines the fifth .",
    "this relation appears to have been little used in the spectroscopic community .",
    "although the precise form of the function @xmath25 holds only for @xmath28 pulses , we have found it to be a useful qualitative indicator for more general @xmath4 .",
    "one important implication is that pulse performance for a given absolute transition width @xmath29 can be made independent of the passband width , @xmath14 .",
    "fixed results in the same performance in terms of residual signal ( ripple ) for different @xmath14 as long as the transition width @xmath30 is constant .",
    "this was observed empirically and noted in @xcite .",
    "we thus use eq.@xmath31[[tbw ] ] to inform our optimal control design .      the approximation to the ideal rectangular frequency response profile , as illustrated in fig.1 ,",
    "can be readily obtained using a variety of methods  among them , the parks - mcclellan ( pm ) algorithm for linear - phase fir digital filters @xcite . after calculating the pm polynomial",
    ", the standard slr algorithm effectively inverts the frequency response to produce a linear phase ( @xmath6 ) rf pulse .",
    "the equivalent optimal control approach would be to use the polynomial response function as the target response and efficiently modify the rf controls to achieve the allowed performance .",
    "however , as noted already , the target response derived using the pm algorithm applies only to @xmath28 , using the ideal rf amplitudes , in the absence of relaxation .",
    "more significantly , optimal control does not need to know the polynomial response .",
    "one can simply define the ideal passband / stopband frequency response , and the algorithm will find the response allowed by the particular choice of bandwidth , pulse length , and transition width .",
    "different functional forms can be defined for the response in the transition region to provide additional flexibility .",
    "the response at each frequency can also be given weights to fine - tune the final excitation profile .",
    "we now proceed with the design of more robust selective excitation pulses . in what follows ,",
    "we let the frequency response to the pulse ( ie , the target function ) be undefined in the transition region .",
    "the pulse has the flexibility to do anything it wants there .",
    "an important addition to the algorithm is an adjustable weight function which changes the weight for each particular offset depending on the deviation of intermediate results from the desired performance . during a given iteration ,",
    "if the deviation of magnetization from the target for a particular offset is larger than the allowed ripple amplitude , then the weight for this offset increases ; otherwise it decreases .",
    "this is an extension and generalization of the method introduced in @xcite .",
    "we present several examples illustrating the advantages of relaxation - compensated selective excitation by optimized pulses ( rc - sebop ) .",
    "as discussed , possible performance improvements include increased tolerance to rf inhomogeneity and compensation for relaxation effects .",
    "the algorithm for generating relaxation compensated broadband pulses ( rc - bebop ) has already been developed @xcite .",
    "it only needs inclusion of the modified target functions described in section [ phaseslope ] for application to selective pulses ( rc - sebop ) .",
    "the primary result of that work is that substantial signal gains are possible relative to expected losses from short , by finding trajectories for the transformed magnetization that minimize these losses , even if this requires a longer pulse length .",
    "relaxation losses are minimized by keeping spins near the z - axis and orienting them so that all offsets can be transformed to the transverse plane in a very short time at the end of the pulse .",
    "this solution not only mitigates the effects of transverse relaxation , but short becomes an advantage due to repolarization of @xmath32-magnetization during the relatively long time the spins are aligned close to the longitudinal axis .",
    "the net affect is that almost all the rf power is applied at the end of our relaxation compensated pulses @xcite .",
    "this is fortunately also consistent with a particular family of solutions for broadband @xmath33 ( refocused ) pulses @xcite .",
    "there are also solutions for refocused selective excitation pulses @xcite that employ significant rf power throughout the pulse and therefore do not lend themselves to relaxation compensation . on the other hand ,",
    "these pulses do an excellent job of minimizing the residual off - axis magnetization in both the passband and stopband .",
    "consistent with this result , we find empirically that minimizing relaxation losses for selective pulses competes with minimizing residual off - axis magnetization .",
    "the trajectories that reduce relaxation effects are not compatible with those that achieve good refocusing .",
    "we therefore consider a strategy that maximizes @xmath34-magnetization in the passband , minimizes it in the stopband , i.e. , the standard procedure , but removes any explicit restrictions on residual @xmath35-magnetization .",
    "this allows the optimal control algorithm to emphasize relaxation compensation and find solutions with considerably enhanced performance compared to those that give highest priority to minimizing the @xmath35-component .",
    "as we will show , this undesirable residual magnetization can be eliminated after the pulse without significantly affecting performance .",
    "in addition to causing signal losses , relaxation can also degrade the uniformity of the excitation profile @xcite .",
    "slurp pulses @xcite were developed specifically to obtain more uniform response over the selected bandwidth while accepting attenuation due to short , .",
    "slurp-1 pulses address the particular case = , and were derived for various values of the ratio /.",
    "for the demanding case = = = 1 ms , theoretical performance of slurp-1 is compared to rc - sebop in fig.@xmath31[slurp ] for rf miscalibrations of @xmath36 , 0% , and + 10% , displayed left to right . for the ideal rf shown in the middle panel ,",
    "rc - sebop provides a signal gain of 60% , uniformly preserving greater than 90%  of the @xmath34-magnetization over the optimized bandwidth of 4  khz , in spite of short @xmath37 equal to the pulse length .",
    "it is relatively insensitive to rf inhomogeneity of @xmath38 . in all cases , there is improved signal suppression from @xmath39 magnetization in the stopband , and a narrower transition width .",
    "analogous investigations have optimized relaxation - compensated pulses by applying simulated annealing to rf waveforms represented using finite fourier series ( @xmath40 frequency components or less ) and no compensation for rf inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "they achieve signals of @xmath41 for the case @xmath42 over a less selective bandwidth than obtained here",
    ". some of our performance gains may be due to a more efficient optimization procedure that does not restrict the solution space .",
    "however , we expect the largest gains are due to the flexibility of allowing residual @xmath35-magnetization , @xmath43 , which can be quite large , as shown in the bottom panel of fig.@xmath31[slurp ] .",
    "this is easily eliminated , as shown later , and allows a much more ideal , rectangular excitation profile than previously considered possible for short , @xcite , with minimal loss of signal . alternatively ,",
    "if we choose to minimize the residual @xmath43 during the optimization , this requires trajectories that sacrifice signal enhancement and selectivity of the passband , consistent with the other cited studies .",
    "a simple strategy for reducing relaxation effects is to reduce the pulse length , but according to eq.@xmath31[[tbw ] ] , achieving acceptable performance for a narrow excitation bandwidth then becomes more problematic .",
    "a given time - bandwidth product requires trade - offs in the sharpness of the excitation profile ( transition width ) and the signal variation ( ripple ) in both the passband and the stopband .",
    "still , one can optimize performance for a desired low value of the time - bandwidth product , as accomplished in the snob family of pulses @xcite . including relaxation compensation beyond what is accomplished by a short pulse length alone and including tolerance to rf inhomogeneity provide additional opportunities for improved performance .    for e - snob , = 1 ms , selective bandwidth @xmath44  khz , we designed a rc - sebop pulse incorporating relaxation times = = and tolerance to rf inhomogeneity of @xmath45 .",
    "pulse shapes are shown in fig.@xmath31[esnob ] along with theoretical performance .",
    "signal gains of a factor of 2 are obtained with the relaxation - compensated pulse , with a sharper excitation profile and improved suppression of @xmath39 magnetization in the stopband . to minimize relaxation losses",
    ", rc - sebop delivers most of its rf power at the end of the pulse . as in the previous example , these enhanced performance features are purchased at the cost of a larger residual @xmath43 compared to e - snob . in the next section ,",
    "we present methods for selecting only the desired @xmath39 magnetization while maintaining the performance advantages of rc - sebop .",
    "all the selective pulses considered so far , both traditional pulses and optimal control pulses , produce significant residual @xmath43 magnetization in the passband at non - ideal rf calibration .",
    "methods for removing this unwanted signal therefore have more general applicability .",
    "to destroy undesired @xmath43 after selective excitation in a single - acquistion experiment , a hard @xmath46 flip - back pulse can be applied to store @xmath39 along the @xmath32-axis . a gradient pulse",
    "is then employed to dephase the @xmath43 component , followed by a hard @xmath47 pulse for acquisition of the signal due to @xmath39 .",
    "this `` crusher '' sequence , implemented in fig.@xmath31[crusher]a as a more general phase - cycled sequence ( to be discussed below ) , was first tested for the case of unlimited - bandwidth hard pulses by applying the hard pulses on resonance .",
    "the transmitter frequency was shifted only for the rc - sebop pulse to measure its off - resonance performance .",
    "this sequence is insensitive to the actual @xmath1 of the sample , since there is minimal relaxation during the short hard pulses and no @xmath1 relaxation of magnetization stored along the @xmath32-axis during the gradient pulse .",
    "in addition , for typical samples with @xmath48 , there are minimal @xmath0 effects as a result of the sequence . however",
    ", for very short @xmath0 , repolarization of stopband magnetization during the gradient pulse can lead to slightly more @xmath39 magnetization in the stopband than expected from the theoretical selectivity profile of rc - bebop , previously illustrated in fig.@xmath31[esnob ] .    to eliminate extra stopband signal in cases where @xmath0 is too short for ideal performance of the original crusher sequence , it can be phase - cycled as shown in the figure .",
    "the two acquisitions add constructively in the passband .",
    "repolarization at stopband frequencies leads to @xmath49-magnetization after the first hard pulse in each cycle which is canceled by addition of the two acquisitions after the second hard pulse . as a general strategy",
    ", this sequence works very well for the case of ideal hard pulses with no bandwidth limitations .",
    "it therefore also works well over a bandwidth of @xmath50  khz for a 25  khz hard pulse , where the performance of the hard pulse is sufficiently ideal , and may be useful for applications that require only a relatively narrow range of stopband frequencies compared to the available rf amplitude of the hard pulse .",
    "more realistically , all pulses have to be applied at the same transmitter frequency to measure the performance of the sequence at larger resonance offsets",
    ". the effective field of the hard pulses will then have a significant @xmath32-component , and the @xmath35-magnetization will no longer remain untouched",
    ". however , the gradient still dephases the transverse magnetization remaining after the first hard pulse . to a first approximation ,",
    "there is only @xmath32-magnetization prior to the second hard pulse , and the phase cycle produces transverse components of opposite sign that cancel on addition .",
    "experimental off - resonance performance of rc - sebop and the phase - cycled crusher sequence is demonstrated in fig.@xmath31[expt1 ] for the residual hdo signal in a sample of 99.96% d@xmath51o , doped with cuso@xmath52 to relaxation times of @xmath53  ms and @xmath54  ms at 298  k.    signals representing offsets between @xmath55  khz to 15  khz were obtained in steps of 200  hz by offsetting the transmitter in this fashion for all applied pulses .",
    "the sequence was first implemented using 10@xmath56s  hard pulses , which resulted in stopband signal of @xmath57 relative to the centerband .",
    "it was then fine - tuned by increasing the hard - pulse length to 10.68@xmath56s  in the first cycle .",
    "the resulting selectivity profile is in very good agreement with the simulations for esnob and rc - bebop performance in fig.@xmath31[esnob ] .",
    "we obtain a signal of 0.83 on resonance using the nominal ideal rf values for rc - sebop compared to the theoretical value 0.89 .",
    "all values are relative to an ideal signal of 1 for the case of no relaxation .",
    "the small disagreement between experiment and simulation can be attributed to rf inhomogeneity / miscalibration in the flip - back pulse , which will leave some small fraction of the desired passband signal in the transverse plane to be destroyed by the gradient .    since relaxation compensation functions by keeping spins close to the @xmath32-axis as long as possible during the pulse , the performance of rc - sebop is not highly specific to particular , values .",
    "although optimized for = = 1  ms , the @xmath58  ms rc - sebop pulse of fig.@xmath31[esnob ] performs well for much shorter relaxation of @xmath59  @xmath56s  and @xmath60  @xmath56s , as shown in fig.@xmath31[expt2 ] .",
    "a signal of 0.73 is obtained on resonance using the nominal ideal rf values for the pulse and the phase - cycled crusher sequence compared to a theoretical value of 0.81 for on - resonance excitation by rc - sebop alone .",
    "the pulse could also be optimized for faster relaxation to improve performance further .",
    "if a single - acquisition sequence is preferred , the sequence of fig.@xmath31[crusher]b can be used to more completely eliminate stopband signal for the case of short @xmath0 .",
    "the first gradient is followed by a hard @xmath61 pulse .",
    "@xmath62 is flipped to @xmath63 where any additional magnetization repolarized during the first gradient pulse can relax to zero during a subsequent delay of the same length as the first .",
    "this extra delay can also be used for additional dephasing of unwanted transverse magnetization by a gradient pulse of opposite sign to the first gradient .",
    "the sequence ends with a hard 90@xmath64 pulse followed by signal acquisition .",
    "however , performance depends more sensitively on any rf inhomogeneity or miscalibration of the hard pulses , since there are now two opportunities to destroy leftover transverse magnetization due to imperfect rotation and storage along the @xmath32-axis .",
    "off - resonance effects of the hard pulses , which now include a 180  pulse , further degrade performance . for the experiment described in fig.@xmath31[expt2 ] ,",
    "a signal of 0.68 is obtained using the single - acquisition sequence of fig.@xmath31[crusher]b .",
    "the scheme is included as an option for narrow passband applications .",
    "in addition , one might want to explore possibilities using broadband , shaped 90  and 180  pulses .",
    "these could also be incorporated into a simpler sequence that eliminates the gradient in fig.@xmath31[crusher]a and cycles according to [ @xmath65 , @xmath35 , acq(@xmath66 ) ] .",
    "these topics are beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "pulses which provide robust and enhanced performance despite rf inhomogeneity / miscalibration and relaxation effects are highly desirable .",
    "the optimal control approach to designing refocused selective excitation pulses with these compensatory mechanisms has been presented .",
    "the examples considered the standard selectivity profile comprised of a passband , transition region , stopband , and variations ( ripple ) in signal uniformity , as illustrated in fig.@xmath31[ripple ] .",
    "constraints and trade - offs in the performance among these fundamental parameters were emphasized . in particular , we found relaxation compensation and null excitation of magnetization in the stopband to be competing goals .",
    "considerable improvements in selectivity and relaxation - compensation for short , were obtained by allowing residual unrefocused magnetization in both the passband and stopband .",
    "this residual magnetization can be readily eliminated without significantly diminishing performance using additional pulse elements .",
