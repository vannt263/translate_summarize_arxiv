    "hadronic collisions at high energies have been extensively studied at various hadron colliders reaffirming that qcd gives a good description of strong interactions . studies with very large momentum transfer , inclusive hadronic final states , heavy flavours and @xmath3-jet events are usually considered to be an essential physics at the lhc .",
    "+ results from previous experiments at the tevatron and at the cern @xmath4 collider have demonstrated that the hard scattering jet cross - section is so far well described by qcd .",
    "some tevatron results of jets up to 450 gev i.e. @xmath5 0.5@xcite show that the agreement between theory and data is at the level of 30% for cross - sections between @xmath1 = 20 gev to @xmath1 = 450 gev .",
    "some dependence on the chosen set of parton distribution functions ( pdf ) is also shown in these papers .",
    "the indications of some excess at large @xmath6 are currently attributed to the uncertainty on the gluon density at @xmath6 .",
    "+ within qcd , the only fundamental quantity that needs to be known is @xmath7 , the qcd coupling constant .",
    "so far there are no concrete ideas on how to improve the knowledge of @xmath7 at the lhc . nevertheless , it is obvious that the lhc experiments will allow accurate consistency checks with qcd predictions for the @xmath1 dependent jet cross sections .",
    "@xmath1 values reached at tevatron ( 450 gev ) can be increased by roughly a factor of ten well into the multi tev domain .",
    "the predictions for these dominant qcd jet cross - sections are also important as potential backgrounds in the search for new phenomena .",
    "even though the expectations summarized in this note are based on leading order qcd calculations only , we expect that they provide a useful guidance for future nlo calculations and more detailed studies about jet physics at the lhc .",
    "+ the structure of the proton at short distances is crucial to predict jet cross - sections and variations from the different types of partons ( quarks and gluons ) .",
    "the contributions from the different parton ",
    "parton collisions are investigated as a funtion of @xmath1 and jet rapidity .",
    "the complex dynamics of processes involving hadrons in the initial state needs to be investigated in detail in order to measure and interpret the physics at the highest possible jet @xmath1 , which corresponds to distance scales of @xmath8 cm ) much smaller than for any other lhc process . in order to study variations as a function of the center of mass energy ,",
    "some distributions are shown as a function of the scaling variable @xmath6 .",
    "finally we give also cross sections of quark final states in the various flavours .",
    "the results obtained show that a measurement of the b - flavoured jets should be possible up to an @xmath1 of a few tev .",
    "+ the results presented in the following need to be improved using next - to - leading - order calculations.some generators such as herwig @xcite with mc@xmath9nlo @xcite and powheg @xcite have included the nlo calculations .",
    "however , the detailed subprocess calculations in different @xmath1 intervals are still not posiible .",
    "furthermore possible systematics from jet fragmentation and the actual reconstruction of jets from the observable mesons and baryons , from hadronization schemes , from diffractive processes and the underlying event structure need also to be investigated during the coming years .",
    "this requires the precise information of parton densities , distribution functions and related uncertainties , particularly when the initial states are composed of hadrons .",
    "the use of high @xmath2 data which are sensitive to a variety of exotic phenomena will be limited by the presence of all these potential uncertainties .",
    "jet production dominates by far all hard processes ( high @xmath1 ) in hadronic collisions . the rapidity and the @xmath1 distributions also depend on the parton distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath10 .",
    "especially the relative contributions from the gluon ",
    "gluon , quark  gluon and quark(anti)quark scattering vary strongly as a function of both @xmath1 and rapidity .",
    "it is thus interesting to study the independent contributions for the different partonic components of the proton .",
    "we compute the relative contributions of different initial state partons to the hard qcd jet cross - sections .",

    "the remaining jets , between 1821% , are from quark ",
    "gluon collisions while only about 1% of these high @xmath2 jets come from gluon ",
    "gluon scattering .",
    "a comparison for the different center - of - mass energies shows that the fraction of quark  quark collisions increases with center of mass energy .",
    "previous results from jet studies at tevatron with @xmath2 = 20 - 450 gev , show that about 20 % uncertainty on high @xmath2 jet rates comes from gluon - induced processes .",

    "in order to make the expected approximate scaling more evident , it is better to study the cross section as a funtion of @xmath6 .",

    "it is also envisaged that the cross section measurements at very high @xmath1 jets have in principle the sensitivity to observe new physics like `` quark compositeness '' up to 3040 tev @xcite , assuming that the predictions from qcd calculations can be done with sufficient accuracy.this needs to be demonstrated with detailed studies .",

    "both figures demonstrate that the super high @xmath1 jets will be produced essentially only in the small rapidity region , corresponding to the central part of the detector .",
    "+ experiments at lep and tevatron @xcite@xcite@xcite have studied also the inclusive charm and bottom quark cross section by selecting samples using the known jet tagging methods . with the expected b - tagging projected capability of the tracking detectors at lhc and the possibility to measure inclusive muon production from charm and beauty decays , it might eventually be possible to measure these flavour dependent cross sections .",

    ", these fractions appear to be essentially @xmath1 independent up to about 1 - 2 tev .",
    "thus , combining the large cross sections and the expected b  tagging capabilities of the detectors , optimistically one might perhaps reach efficiencies of 50% for b  jets and 1% for backgrounds .",
    "thus , the potential b  signal to background ratio should not be too different from 1:1 .",
