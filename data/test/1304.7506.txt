    "a long time ago a rather unorthodox physics of crystals possessing three - dimensional ( 3d ) pseudo - relativistic quasiparticles @xcite , exhibiting an electronic dispersion relation @xmath5 , where the velocity @xmath3 is of the order of the fermi velocity in regular condensed matter systems , was invoked to describe properties of @xmath6 .",
    "the ultra - relativistic linear dispersion relation describes two conical bands ( of opposite orientation ) sharing the same cone tip .",
    "recently several proposals ogata , vishwanath , kane , kane , bernevig revived an interest in materials with such excitations nowadays called weyl semi - metals .",
    "the fermi `` surface '' of such materials , typically with dominant spin - orbit interactions , consists just of a finite number of disconnected points ( called weyl or dirac points , defined below ) rather than forming a continuous fermi surface like electrons in usual metals .",
    "the revived interest emerged of course after years of intense experimental and theoretical study of graphene , a 2d weyl quasiparticle material @xcite .",
    "suspended graphene is just such a `` semimetal '' system and exhibits a number of remarkable properties .",
    "for example , despite having zero density of states at the fermi level and ideally no impurities , it still has a nonzero dc conductivity@xcite .    while this band `` touching '' at a singular point",
    "was noticed in band structure calculations even before the seminal work of wallace on graphitewallace , the first explicit use of the dirac model in 3d was in the context of the two - band approximation model of bismuth@xcite . due to the strong spin - orbit interaction , the linear in @xmath7 terms in",
    "a low energy effective theory near the crystallographic point @xmath8 of the fcc brillouin zone , dominate over quadratic terms ( that dominate near the @xmath9 point , leading to a common `` effective mass '' description ) .",
    "the electronic excitations are described by an analog of the weyl equation of particle physics , which describes eight two - component chiral spinors @xmath10 ( two for each of the four @xmath8 points )    @xmath11    the sign describes the chirality of the mode .",
    "metallic bismuth is only approximately described by the ultrarelativistic `` massless '' dispersion relation since the quasiparticles of the opposite chirality are coupled and form four - component massive dirac bispinors . in @xmath6 therefore electrons are not weyl , but @xmath12 massive dirac electrons where , in addition , the fermi level is located away from the dirac point .",
    "a number of related suggestions for suitable realizations of weyl semimetals were recently put forward .",
    "kariyado and ogata@xcite calculated the band structure of cubic inverse perovskites like @xmath13 with significant spin - orbit coupling .",
    "they observed the appearance of six weyl points with a very small relativistic electron mass down to @xmath14 on the line connecting the @xmath9 - and the @xmath15 - points . in iridium - based pyrochlores such as @xmath16 ,",
    "there are @xmath17 weyl points located near the four @xmath8 points of the fcc lattice .",
    "as noted invishwanath these materials `` in particular provide a unique opportunity to study the interplay of coulomb interactions , spin - orbit coupling , and the band topology of solids '' . also , strong spin - orbit interactions can lead to a novel phase of matter , the topological insulator@xcite and various possibilities to create weyl fermions combined into coincident opposite chirality points or separated in the brillouin zone in @xmath18kane , @xmath19 ,  @xmath20@xcite .",
    "these proposals generated a great deal of experimental efforts@xcite .",
    "the system with 3d weyl points was proposed to appear in optical lattices@xcite following the discovery of `` artificial graphene''@xcite .    since the density of carriers in 3d weyl semimetals at zero temperature is zero ( as in suspended graphene in 2d ) , the coulomb interactions are unscreened and therefore are expected to be important to the understanding of the electrical and optical response of these materials .",
    "unsophisticatedly the dimensionless coupling,@xmath21is of order @xmath22 provided the dielectric constant @xmath23 is not large , since the analog of the light velocity , @xmath3 , is of the order typically of the fermi velocity .",
    "note that the same coulomb potential @xmath24 created by an electron influences many more electrons in 3d compared to 2d , so naively , in 3d its importance is expected to increase . while electric transport in noninteracting 3d weyl fermions was studied ( @xcite and references therein to earlier papers in the context of particle physics ) ,",
    "the contributions of potentially very important coulomb interactions ( coulomb scattering corrections to transport as an example ) have not been studied theoretically , except basic renormalization effects vishwanath12 .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation in graphene .",
    "the effect of the coulomb interactions in undoped graphene turned out to be highly nontrivial , even within perturbation theory , and have evoked a scientific controversy@xcite due to the problem of the `` ultraviolet regularization '' , and was just recently settled@xcite by noting that the ambiguities are associated with the treatment of the separation of scales related to the chiral anomaly@xcite .",
    "some aspects of the weyl semimetal physics are _ not _ dominated by the weyl points of the brillouin zone at which the spectrum is gapless . for example , the ac conductivity of undoped graphene ( the weak logarithmic renormalization of the electron velocity @xcite does not influence the result ) , is given in terms of its value in the noninteracting theory , @xmath25 , by    @xmath26    and is strictly dissipative ( real ) .",
    "this expression is independent of frequency ( provided corrections of order @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the hopping energy , are neglected ) .",
    "the value of the only numerical constant @xmath29 appearing here has been a matter of intense controversy .",
    "the first detailed calculation@xcite utilizing a sharp momentum cutoff regularization of the dirac model provided a value @xmath30 of order @xmath31 .",
    "the use of the sharp momentum cutoff was criticized by mishchenkomishchenko , who obtained an exceptionally small value of @xmath32 making a `` soft '' momentum cutoff regularization .",
    "he supported this choice by the consistency of the kubo and the kinetic equation calculations of conductivity with that of the polarization function .",
    "the consistency required a modification of the long - range interaction so that it becomes uv cutoff dependent .",
    "this apparently closed the issue .",
    "albeit such a small numerical value would have profound physical consequences even beyond the transport and dielectric properties .",
    "nevertheless the interaction strength @xmath29 was recalculated once again by vafek , juricic and herbut@xcite , who argued that the modification of the interaction requires simultaneously a pauli - villars regularization of massless fermions .",
    "they applied yet another regularization , making the space dimensionality fractional , @xmath33 that modified both the current operator and the interaction in such a way that they satisfy the ward identities and obtained @xmath34 .",
    "the dimensional regularization is questionable on physical grounds and in a comprehensive subsequent workmacdonald the authors reaffirmed the small value @xmath35 it seems that this value is the commonly accepted one .",
    "the tight binding calculation@xcite however demonstrated that @xmath36 is the correct one . to reveal the origin of the ambiguity exhibited by the various values of @xmath29 , the authors made use of a dynamical approach developed earlier@xcite ( to address the problem of separating the interband contributions from the intraband effects due to contactsziegler , lewkowicz11 ) directly in the dc case by `` switching on '' a uniform electric field in the tight binding model with coulomb interactions , and then considering the large - time limit .",
    "this approach ( known in field theory as the `` infinite hotel story '' ) is the best way to reveal physical effects of anomalies@xcite .",
    "one can directly separate the contributions from the neighborhood of dirac points and the `` anomalous '' contributions from the rest of the brillouin zone , so that one can decide what regularization of the effective weyl theory is the correct one . in this sense",
    "this is advantageous over the standard diagrammatic kubo formula calculation in continuummishchenko , herbut1,herbut2,macdonald that might encounter the so - called schwinger terms ( found in quantum electrodynamics , that is similar to the 3d weyl fermions ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the effect of coulomb interactions in 3d weyl fermion systems with emphasis on dynamical aspects of electric transport and compare / contrast it with the corresponding results in 2d weyl fermions . to achieve this goal",
    "we define in section ii a tight binding description of weyl fermions on a hypercubic lattice of any dimensionality similar to a variant of the hamiltonian lattice model in field theory@xcite already used in its lagrangian version to simulate graphene@xcite . in this model",
    "the electron s spin is strongly coupled to momentum and therefore the model is very reminiscent , in this respect , of the wolff model of bismuth or lattice realizations of topological insulators .",
    "the lattice `` regularization '' is necessary to address the ultraviolet divergencies at the intermediated stages of calculations , a problem mentioned above .",
    "the universality of this description of weyl fermions ( of various origins ) is supported by the fact that such a 2d model gives the same result for the interaction corrections as the tight binding model on the honeycomb lattice with zero spin - orbit coupling .    in section iii the correction to the self energy of a quasiparticle with momentum",
    "@xmath37 is considered .",
    "it is shown that the fermi velocity renormalization in 3d ( already noted in@xcite ) is logarithmic in the uv cutoff @xmath38 ( @xmath39 being the lattice spacing ) very much like in 2d@xcite:@xmath40 \\text{. }   \\label{renv}\\]]section iv is devoted to a general derivation and application of the dynamical approach to the electric response to the dc and ac electric field . in particular , we obtain the slow current decay in a dc field @xmath41 of the neutral , noninteracting 3d weyl plasma and show that the relaxation is powerwise , see fig.1 .",
    "the long time asymptotics is oscillating and depends on the microscopic details via cutoff @xmath39:@xmath42 \\text{. } \\label{cur_decay}\\]]here @xmath43 is the number of weyl fermions .",
    "this explains how the pseudo - ohmic dc conductivity vanishes in 3d .",
    "the relaxation dynamics therefore is qualitatively different from 2d , where it is insensitive to the cutoff @xcite .",
    "for the ac electric field similar slow convergence to the ac conductivity occurs , see fig .",
    "2 . even in the free weyl semimetal one gets , in addition to a finite real ( pseudo - dissipative ) partlinear in frequency@xcite , @xmath44an imaginary part , logarithmically divergent as function of the uv cutoff:@xmath45this is again different from graphene at zero doping and leads to important dielectric properties .",
    "relaxation to the asymptotic behavior is faster at higher frequencies .",
    "the leading interaction correction to the real and imaginary conductivities per weyl point are subject of section v , see fig.3 for comparison with a metal and a semiconductor .",

    "the imaginary part gets further logarithmically dependent on cutoff corrections,@xmath48 \\text { , }   \\label{imsig}\\]]despite an apparent `` renormalizability '' of the model to the two loop order at least .",
    "this is due to the fact that the complex conductivity is not simply related to basic green s functions like in the relativistic theory .",
    "the physical significance of the results including formulas including that for the complex dielectric constant , see fig.4 , are summarized in the concluding section vi .",
    "we speculate about obvious improvements like the random phase approximation , renormalization group and a possibility of stronger coupling effects like the exciton condensation .",
    "the noninteracting tight binding model is defined on the hypercubic lattice @xmath49 with lattice vectors @xmath50 of length @xmath39 by the hamiltonian :    @xmath51    here  @xmath52 are pauli matrices , operators @xmath53 create a two component spinor @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the hopping integral that in the presence of an external electromagnetic field , described by vector potential @xmath56 is @xmath57 , \\label{wilson}\\]]where the hopping energy @xmath58 is of order of the band width .",

    "it was demonstrated in the context of graphene@xcite that some aspects of the linear response physics , including the coulomb interactions corrections@xcite , are _ not _ dominated by the weyl points of the brillouin zone at which the effective low energy model is valid .",
    "for example , large contributions ( infinite , when the size of the brillouin zone is being considered infinite ) to the conductivity from the vicinity of the weyl points are cancelled by contributions from the region between them .",
    "another famous consequence of this scale nonseparation is the `` species doubling '' of lattice fermionssmit , which in the context of graphene means that there necessarily appears a pair of weyl points of opposite chirality .",
    "the uv regularization of the effective theory _ does matter _ and , if one were to use such a model , the only regularization known to date to be consistent with the tight binding is the space dimensional regularization developed in ref .",

    "this would allow to study the plasmons effects and even the strong coupling phenomena like the exciton condensation@xcite . beyond the linear response , phenomena like the nonlinear i - v curves due to the particle - hole ( schwinger ) pair creation and relaxation due to their recombination studied in the context of graphene@xcite also can be extended to 3d in a straightforward fashion .",
