    "the physics of the liquid state has been the subject of intense research activity .",
    "novel approaches and novel apparatus have made possible the study of liquids under extreme thermodynamic conditions and in wide windows of space and time .",
    "interesting and unexpected new phenomena have emerged as a result of a combined effort involving experiments , theory and simulations@xcite .",
    "one of these is the possibility of a liquid - liquid ( ll ) transition in one - component systems  in addition to the usual liquid - gas transition . several liquids @xcite and several models @xcite have been studied in detail , and it appears that the class of materials where a ll transition can be observed is larger than the class of tetrahedral liquids that were originally considered @xcite possible candidates for a ll transition .",
    "water is one of the liquids that might possess a ll transition .",
    "indeed , the first conjecture of a ll transition was based on a numerical study of the st2 potential @xcite , a model designed to mimic the behavior of liquid water . in the case of st2 ,",
    "the two coexisting phases differ in their local structure . the low density phase is formed by an open tetrahedrally - coordinated network of hydrogen bonds , while the high density phase has a more distorted network of hydrogen bonds .",
    "recent theoretical work has shown that the interplay between local energy , entropy , and volume which may generate a ll transition can in principle be realized by spherically - symmetric potentials @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the @xmath0 equation of state ( eos ) is key to test for phase coexistence ( gas - liquid , liquid - crystal and ll ) , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 denote the pressure , density , and temperature .",
    "the numerical calculation of @xmath4 requires the study of the model for a variety of state points .",
    "the coexistence between two phases , in the appropriate temperature window , appears as a region of density values where @xmath1 is constant . in small - size numerical simulations",
    "is sometimes hard to observe phase transitions directly in one simulation box , in part because the free energy associated with creating an interface often stabilizes metastable phases@xcite . in these cases",
    "@xmath0 does not show any flat region @xcite .",
    "a different approach for studying in one single numerical simulation an entire isotherm has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and later exploited in the experimental study of colloidal systems and in the study of crystallization profiles ref .",
    "this approach simulates a semi - infinite tube in the presence of a very strong gravitational field and measures the density profile in equilibrium .",
    "a simple inversion of the density profile allows the model eos to be constructed .",
    "this idea has also been applied in the experimental study of the eos of colloidal particles , by inversion of the measured sedimentation equilibrium profile .    here",
    "we apply the sedimentation profile method to st2 water .",
    "we find that an interface separating two liquid states appears at low temperature , corresponding to the coexistence of two metastable liquid states of water within one simulation box , providing evidence for the presence of an ll transition .",
    "we study @xmath5 rigid molecules of mass @xmath6 interacting through the st2 water potential , a rigid , non - polarizable , 5-site potential @xcite that is able to reproduce qualitatively the thermodynamic anomalies of liquid water .",
    "`` st2 water '' is characterized , on cooling , by isobaric density maxima , increasing compressibility , increasing constant @xmath1 specific heat , and evidence for a ll transition in the deeply supercooled regime ( which is difficult to probe experimentally due to spontaneous crystallization @xcite ) .    to implement the sedimentation profile method ,",
    "we use a column - shaped simulation box , semi - infinite along the @xmath7 axis and with periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath8 and @xmath9 axes .",
    "the top of the box is left open , while the bottom is assumed to be a repulsive soft - sphere surface , generating a short - range force proportional to @xmath10 acting on the molecule center of mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig_column ] ) .",
    "the box width in the @xmath8-axis and @xmath9-axis directions is 3  nm , corresponding to a bottom surface area of @xmath11  nm@xmath12 .",
    "a strong gravitational field @xmath13 is applied downward , in the @xmath7-axis direction , where @xmath14  kg / m@xmath12 is the earth s gravitational field .",
    "the value of the field controls the range of @xmath1-values accessed in the simulations .",
    "the pressure at the bottom of the column is @xmath15mpa .",
    "we perform the simulations using a multi - processor code on sgi origin 2000 , ibm  sp , and ibm regatta supercomputers .",
    "we choose a 1  fs time step and study different temperatures from @xmath16  k down to @xmath17  k. for t=@xmath18  k , we simulate four different systems to better estimate error and reproducibility of the results .",
    "a long ( @xmath19 ) equilibration time precedes the actual calculation of the equilibrium density profile . to analyze equilibration we monitored the running average of the @xmath7-position of the center of mass .",
    "production runs lasted at least 200  ps for the higher temperatures up to several ns per box when @xmath17  k.    we define a mass density field @xmath20 by averaging the density over bins with height @xmath21  nm to calculate the pressure field @xmath22 from @xmath23 a parametric plot of @xmath22 vs. @xmath20 provides the eos .",
    "figure  [ fig : height ] shows the equilibrium density profile along the @xmath7-axis for three different temperatures .",
    "each symbol represents one bin , where the height of each bin @xmath21  nm . for @xmath16",
    "k we see only one break in the density profile : the topmost points in the plots correspond to the gas - liquid interface . above these points is a much less dense gas not shown on this density scale . for @xmath24",
    "k , there appears an inflection . for @xmath17",
    "k , we see a clear break in the density , associated with the interface between two different liquid states .    figure  [ fig : eos ] shows the corresponding @xmath25 relations at the same three temperatures .",
    "we also show @xmath25 as evaluated previously using standard md for cubic boxes with periodic boundary conditions for systems with @xmath26 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath27 ( ref.@xcite ) . in refs",
    "@xcite and @xcite @xmath1 was calculated with the standard virial relation@xcite .",
    "consistent with the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : height ] , we see a region of coexistence between two different phases at @xmath28 , in agreement with the estimated location of the ll transition in ref .  @xcite .",
    "note that when using the sedimentation equilibration method , we see no unphysical loops in the equation of state , unlike cubic box simulations where the boundary conditions may artificially stabilize metastable states .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    to confirm that the two coexisting phases are both liquids , we calculate the mean square displacement ( msd ) for different height values , both below and above the interface .",
    "we follow the evolution of each molecule for an average mean squared displacement smaller that @xmath29 , so that each height value can be unambiguously assigned to an average density value .",
    "figure  [ fig : diff ] shows that both phases are sufficiently diffusive .",
    "the low density phase has smaller diffusivity , in agreement with previous simulations of the density dependence of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "we studied the eos of `` st2 water '' with the sedimentation profile method , and presented evidence that the eos at @xmath28 shows a clear phase coexistence , between two phases which are both liquids .",
    "the observed ll coexistence in the st2 potential phase diagram is consistent with estimate of the `` critical point '' being located around @xmath30  k , @xmath31  mpa , and @xmath32  g/@xmath33 .",
    "note that for most simple water models , the temperature and pressure scales are shifted relative to real values , thus they must be shifted to place them within an experimental context@xcite .",
    "the critical point estimated experimentally is around @xmath34  k and @xmath35  mpa with @xmath32  g/@xmath33@xcite .",
