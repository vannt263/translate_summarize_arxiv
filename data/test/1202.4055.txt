    "although the cuprate superconductors have been studied for a quarter century , the exact form of the interplay of antiferromagnetic(af ) and d - wave pairing(dsc ) order at low hole doping is not known reliably .",

    "we analyse the role of af and dsc interlayer coupling in multilayer cuprates and their effect on the coexistence on af and dsc order .    the observation by kitaoka , mukuda and collaborators @xcite of substantial zero magnetic field shifts on a unique cu - site in the innermost layers led them to claim uniform af order in underdoped layers with @xmath14 .",
    "the multilayer cuprates are doped by acceptors in the insulating blocks between the multilayer blocks , but their random potential will be weakened in the inner layers due to screening by the more highly doped metallic outer layers .",
    "thus these multilayer cuprates offer the best possibility to reliably determine af and dsc ordering at low doping in a clean single layer . in this paper",
    "we illustrate the potential of multilayer systems by considering the case of 4-layer cuprates for which experimental results exist in a wide density range .",
    "variational monte carlo calculations for an ideal single layer strong coupling t - j model find a substantial coexistence region of spatially uniform af and dsc order up to a critical hole density @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "theoretical support for dsc order at low doping in a single layer also comes from exact diagonalization studies on clusters of the t - j model containing up to 32-sites doped with 2 holes @xcite . when extrapolated to an infinite layer , these point to a robust d - wave cooperon ( bound hole pair ) resonance at low doping .",
    "the virtual exchange of cooperons will act as a pairing mechanism for doped holes in near nodal states at low hole densities , in the presence of strong af local ( and probably long range ) order @xcite .",
    "the two order parameters to be determined are the sublattice magnetization of af order and the pairing amplitude of dsc ordering .",
    "the former is directly measured by the zero field shift on cu - sites in nmr experiments . @xcite in multilayer samples the josephson couplings between the dsc order in neighboring layers lead to the josephson plasma resonances which appear in infrared spectra with the electric field oriented along the c - axis @xcite .",
    "the energies of these resonances are proportional to the product of the dsc order parameters .",
    "the combination of these two measurements on the same samples can , in principle , be used to determine the values and the dependence of both af and dsc order parameters on the hole density . to obtain information on the interplay of af and dsc order in a single layer ,",

    "rmft calculations@xcite generally agree well with more accurate variational monte - carlo calculations @xcite in the case of a single layer .    to treat multilayer materials we require the values of the interlayer couplings .",

    "though the dielectric constant required to fit the hole density changes from 87 to 247 as the total hole density decreases from 0.46 to 0.264 , the physics in each layer should not change very much as analyzed above . in table 1",

    "the former values are considerably larger than the latter , indicating an over estimation of the afm order in the rmft theory .",

    "for example , if we scale the value of the estimated hole density so that the optimal density with the highest tc for a single layer is @xmath107 rather @xmath108 quoted in mukuda et al.@xcite , this leads to an increase in the input values for the hole density in the rmft calculations by a factor of 1.25",
    ". then the calculated values of the af moment shown in tab 1 , are smaller , although still too big , and in better agreement with experiment .",
    "turning to the dsc ordering , as mentioned earlier the pairing amplitudes enter into the josephson plasma frequencies observed in the infrared spectra with the electric field oriented along the c - axis . in multilayer cuprates , there are two kinds of josephson plasma frequencies which correspond to inter - multilayer and intra - multilayer josephson couplings respectively . in this paper , we are only interested the latter , i.e. the josephson plasma frequencies related to the josephson coupling between two adjacent cuo@xmath7 layers in same unit cell .",

    "the rmft calculations / citestripe - rvb and also the results of single vmc calculations / citevmc , give a more extended region of coexistence of the two order parameters than that observed in single and bilayer cuprates .",
    "the extended coexistence region in the 4- layer cuprates agrees with the conclusion of the nmr experiments in the inner layers . in our analysis",
    "the extended region comes not from strong interlayer magnetic and josephson coupling , but from the extended coexistence region already present in single layers in the rmft approximation .",
    "this analysis suggests that the difference in the density range of coexisting order in multilayer cuprates compared to experiments on single and bilayer cuprates , is due to the better screening of the external potential modulation in the inner layers of multilayer cuprates , when compared to single and bilayer cuprates .",
    "the latter are adjacent to the random acceptors , while the metallic outer layers screen the random potential at the inner layers . in principle",
    "the combination of zero field nmr and infrared josephson plasma frequencies allows one to determine both af and dsc order parameters .",
    "however , in order to go further and directly compare measured and calculated order parameters a better determination of the interlayer josephson coupling constant and its variation with the hole densities in the individual layers , is required . to this end",
    "a series of measurements of the josephson plasma frequencies and the af moments by zero field nmr at different hole densities on the same multilayer material would be helpful .",
