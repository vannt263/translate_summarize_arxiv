    "in high energy physics experiments , photomultipliers are popular devices used as a light - to - charge transducer .",
    "short - term instability ( rate effect ) of photomultiplier s gain has been a well - known phenomenon  @xcite , which poses one of the major problems to realize good detector performance . for photomultipliers used in our trigger counter  @xcite , stability was one of the major concerns . roughly speaking ,",
    "gain stability within @xmath0 was required up to the counting rate of a few mhz .",
    "more detailed accounts will be given in  4.2 .    in order to investigate photomultiplier s gain change ,",
    "a stable pulsed light source and/or an output light monitor system were needed .",
    "considering pulse rate involved and handiness , the only light source available was led .",
    "however , led light outputs might vary substantially at a repetition rate of a mhz region .",
    "this motivated us to develop a light monitor system , which was suitable to a pulsed light source lit at the repetition rate of mhz or higher . needed accuracy for our particular application was a few % .",
    "we employed a photon counting method for this purpose .",
    "we describe the results of studies on the led light source and its monitor system in the following sections .",
    "this report is organized as follows : in  2 the principle of the photon counting method is described . the experimental setup and the results of test measurements are shown in  3 and  4 , respectively .",
    "the section 5 summarizes our studies .",
    "fig.[fig - principle ] shows a schematic diagram which illustrates our method .",
    "a photomultiplier under test , placed in front of a pulsed led , receives most of the light output .",
    "we sample a very small portion of the lights and inject it to a monitor photon detector .",
    "let @xmath1 denotes the sampling fraction of photons ; it mainly depends on geometrical factors such as the distance between the light source and detector , and , if exist , an aperture and attenuation filters between them .",
    "we regard this fraction to be practically constant during the course of a measurement .",
    "the expected number of photons per pulse detected by the monitor detector is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 represents the average number of photons per pulse emitted by led , and @xmath4 the monitor s detection efficiency .",
    "the probability distribution for @xmath5 is given by the poisson distribution . in this method",
    "we adjust @xmath6 , the average number of photons per pulse , to be much less than unity",
    ". this can be done at will by changing , for example , aperture size or attenuation filters .",
    "since the probability to detect one or more photons per pulse is given by @xmath7 @xmath8 can be represented by @xmath9 we can monitor @xmath10 by measuring @xmath11 , and thus the average led light output assuming @xmath12 to be constant . here",
    "an important feature required for the monitor photon detector is capability of discriminating the single photon signal from background noise . in our actual setup",
    "we used a photomultiplier as a monitor detector .",
    "as described in the following section in detail , we could distinguish clearly a single photoelectron peak from a pedestal@xcite .",
    "we measured the counts in which outputs from the monitor photomultiplier exceeded some prescribed level set between the pedestal and single photoelectron peak .",
    "then @xmath11 was given by the counts divided by the total number of pulses which triggered the led light source .",
    "the principal advantages of the method are the followings :    ( i ) : :    as long as the single photon signal can be discriminated from    background noise , small gain variation of a monitor photon detector    itself has almost no effect on @xmath11 and thus    @xmath10 .",
    "this is the most important feature    in this method .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath10 is    much bigger than one and the monitor photon detector measures the    light output every pulse , it is not possible to distinguish the change    in the led output itself from the gain variation in the monitor    detector .",
    "( ii ) : :    if the peak corresponding to the single photon can be observed , the    gain change may be monitored by measuring its peak position .",
    "this    feature is helpful to demonstrate reliability in the monitor detector .",
    "( iii ) : :    the monitor detector must be able to discriminate the single photon    from background noise , as mentioned above .",
    "however , it is not    necessary to resolve single photon from two ( or more ) photons since    the measured quantity is @xmath11 .",
    "this lessens    requirement for the monitor detector .",
    "( iv ) : :    the actual counting rate for the monitor detector can be set low by    adjusting @xmath10 to be much less than unity .",
    "we note that monitor detectors are usually more stable at lower    counting rates for a fixed gain .",
    "disadvantages of the method , on the other hand , are that it monitors not instantaneous but average light outputs , and that it takes rather long time to obtain enough statistical accuracy . for example",
    ", when an led is lit at 10 khz and @xmath10 is @xmath13 , then it takes 100 sec to obtain @xmath14 counts , the number of counts needed to reach the statistical accuracy of @xmath15 .",
    "it is expected that main source of the systematic errors for the method stems from various backgrounds to the monitor photon detector .",
    "it turns out that thermal noises and after - pulses are the two major backgrounds when a photomultiplier is used as a monitor photon detector .",
    "we thus studied these backgrounds carefully ( see below for the detail ) .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig - setup ] , the system consisted of a light source , a quartz fiber for photon sampling , a monitor photon detector , and a trigger and read - out electronic system .",
    "a photomultiplier subject to rate effect studies was placed in front of the light source .",
    "a brief description of each component is given below .",
    "we used a ` blue ' led  @xcite as a light source . for the present application ,",
    "it was found advantageous to use blue in two respects .",
    "first , the tail of its light output was substantially shorter(@xmath1620 nsec ) than that of a ` green ' led ( @xmath1650 nsec )  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the emission spectrum of the blue led resembled more to that of the scintillator we used ; a desirable property for the photomultiplier gain test .",
    "[ fig - circuit ] shows the led driver circuit .",
    "the circuit provided a constant charge to the led stored in the capacitor @xmath17 .",
    "the discharge was triggered by a differential switch , which in turn initiated by an external nim pulse .",
    "after the discharge , the capacitor @xmath17 was recharged by an external power supply with the charge - up time constant @xmath18 of 0.1 @xmath19sec .",
    "a variable frequency nim clock generator was used to produce a master pulse .",
    "its output was fed to the led driver and to a scaler .",
    "output signals from the monitor photon detector , a photomultiplier for the present case , were discriminated and fed into a coincidence circuit .",
    "we set the discriminator threshold level at about 1/4 of the single photoelectron peak .",
    "the coincidence signal of the discriminator output and the master clock produced a 60-nsec - long gate to a charge sensitive adc , which integrated the raw signal from the monitor photon detector .",
    "the gate signal was also counted by another scaler .",
    "data from the adc and scalers were read by a computer via a camac system .",
    "as stated , we used a photomultiplier as a monitor photon detector .",
    "selection of an actual photomultiplier was made by considering ( i ) single - photoelectron resolution , ( ii ) thermal noise rate , and ( iii ) after - pulse rate .",
    "we tested the following types of photomultipliers ; hamamatsu r329 , r1332 , r2165 and r3234  @xcite .",
    "it was found that backgrounds due to the after - pulse depended strongly upon photomultiplier types , and that , for some of them , they were the source of the most serious systematic errors .",
    "we finally chose r3234 from those listed above with an emphasis on this point .",
    "[ [ single - photoelectron - resolution ] ] single - photoelectron resolution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    fig.[fig - single ] shows the pulse height spectrum obtained with the photomultiplier actually used ; the left peak ( scaled off ) corresponds to a pedestal and the right to the single photoelectron .",
    "we defined a signal count as an event above a software cut placed at the bottom of the valley on this spectrum .",
    "the actual cut position was 0.4 in units of the single photoelectron , i.e. the adc counts between the pedestal and single photoelectron peak .",
    "it was confirmed that variation of the cut position within a reasonable range from the nominal value resulted a negligible change in the final results  @xcite .",
    "[ [ thermal - noise ] ] thermal noise + + + + + + + + + + + + +    thermal ( random ) noises may contribute to a systematic error .",
    "we measured the noise rate and found it to be @xmath16 400 hz at 15 @xmath20 .",
    "the background count per pulse is then @xmath16400 hz@xmath2160 nsec ( adc gate width ) @xmath22 .",
    "this should be compared with an average signal rate of @xmath10 .",
    "the background is thus severe at small @xmath10 ; however , it is possible to adjust @xmath1 so that @xmath10 is much larger than the noise contribution . in our actual measurements ( see  4.2 for an example ) , the lowest value for @xmath10 was chosen to be 0.006 .",
    "thus the error due to this noise is negligible ( @xmath23 )  @xcite .",
    "[ [ after - pulse ] ] after - pulse + + + + + + + + + + +    an after - pulse is a spurious pulse induced in a photomultiplier by previous pulses  @xcite .",
    "it is induced by positive ion hits on a photocathode which is produced by collisions between electrons and residual gas molecules in the tube .",
    "since original electron currents are initiated by input light , the after - pulse has time and rate correlation with the input light .",
    "let s denote by @xmath24 the average number of after - pulses per input light which emits single photoelectron .",
    "then , in the worst case , namely when the after - pulse happens to have a complete time correlation with the following signal pulse , @xmath10 would increase to @xmath25 .",
    "thus the only way to reduce this error is to choose a photomultiplier with small @xmath24 .    in order to find an appropriate photomultiplier , we measured this quantity @xmath24 .",
    "the measurement was done with the same setup shown in fig.[fig - setup ] with one minor change ; the delay generator started the gate pulse about 200 nsec after the led light pulse .",
    "the gate width determined the time interval to look for the after - pulses .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig - afr3234 ] for the photomultiplier we selected ( r3234 ) , together with another type of 2-inch photomultiplier ( r2165 ) for comparison . in the figures , the abscissa represents the integration period ( the gate width ) while the ordinate represents the after - pulse probability @xmath24 .",
    "as can be seen , the integrated counts saturate around the gate width of 10 @xmath19sec . from the results above and similar measurements for the other types of photomultipliers listed above",
    ", we concluded that the integration time of 128 @xmath19sec was long enough to detect practically all the after - pulses .",
    "the selected photomultiplier r3234 has particularly small value ( @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "we thus expect the error due to this background is also negligible .",
    "it is difficult to determine the absolute accuracy of this method experimentally since there is no ` ideal ' light source to calibrate with .",
    "nevertheless we wanted to obtain a crude ` estimate ' of its accuracy , and thus compared it with one other method .    in place of a test photomultiplier , we set an r329 photomultiplier operated in a diode mode .",
    "this was accomplished by keeping the cathode at -300 v while all the other dynodes grounded .",
    "the average cathode current was measured by an amplifier and a current monitor .",
    "since there was no electron multiplication involved , the output current was expected to be proportional to the input light even at high rate . at low rate ,",
    "however , the output was dominated by electronic noise , and the measurement became less accurate .",
    "actually we measured the output current produced by the led light pulse at the repetition rate between 0.7 mhz and 5 mhz  @xcite .",
    "the measured values of the current from r329 were converted to the charge per pulse and then normalized to that at 0.7 mhz .",
    "the resultant quantities , namely the normalized led light outputs per pulse as a function of pulse rate , are displayed in fig.[fig - cathode ] , together with the corresponding quantities obtained with the photon counting method .",
    "as seen , they agree fairly well with each other up to 5 mhz . the maximum deviation is found to be about @xmath27 .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy is not clear at present  @xcite .          in this subsection , we show an example of the gain stability measurement performed with this system .",
    "the photomultipliers under test were used in the trigger counter in our experiment  @xcite .",
    "their short - term stability was one of the major concerns because of the following reasons .",
    "the trigger counter was composed of a set of plastic scintillator slabs and was installed in an intense neutral @xmath28 beam .",
    "scintillation lights from the counter were read by photomultipliers attached at the both ends of the scintillators .",
    "we chose hamamatsu r1398@xcite , a photomultiplier with a bialkali photocathode which had a spectral response well matched with an emission spectrum of the scintillator , and a linear focused dynode chain which provided a fast rise time and a good pulse linearity .",
    "these properties , together with its cathode diameter ( 1 - 1/8@xmath29 ) , were well suited to our application .",
    "we used an ac - coupled preamplifier and base - line restorer as a part of the read - out circuit .",
    "the preamplifier ( with @xmath16 30 db gain ) helped to reduce photomultiplier s average anode current while the base - line restorer compensated base - line shifts at high counting rate .",
    "if the photomultiplier gains were to be set high to compensate possible gain drop at high counting rate , hit rates would increase by background particles such as neutrons and gammas in the beam . for our experiment ( @xmath30 rare decay )",
    ", these background hits should be avoided as much as possible to reduce trigger rates and to ensure high reconstruction efficiency in off - line analysis .",
    "in addition a large pulse would tend to cause a longer dead time for a preamplifier due to saturation , making the counter inefficient . as a consequence",
    "the photomultiplier gain should be kept as low as practical while maintaining @xmath31 efficiency for the minimum ionizing particles .",
    "this demanded good gain stability ( say relative gain change within @xmath32 ) at the expected highest counting rate ( i.e. , @xmath33 mhz for each photomultiplier ) .",
    "fig.[fig - r1398 ] shows the result for the r1398 type photomultiplier .",
    "it shows the r1398 output divided by @xmath10 as a function of the led pulse rate ; the ratio is then rescaled to 1 at 86 khz . in the measurement ,",
    "the led light intensity on r1398 was adjusted to give approximately 100 photoelectrons per pulse independent of the pulse rate , which was approximately equal to the average scintillator light output produced by minimum ionizing particles passing through our trigger counter .",
    "we accomplished this by pulsing 7 identical leds in turn , thus keeping the effective pulse rate for any individual led less than 1 mhz  @xcite .",
    "the maximum deviation of the normalized r1398 output from the unity is found to be about 3% in the rage from 86 khz to 5 mhz .",
    "thus we concluded the photomultiplier , combined with the base used , met our requirements .",
    "we note that the two of the photomultipliers , r3234 ( the monitor photon detector ) and r1398 , ` see ' quite different photons ; the former sees mostly single photons with relatively low rates while the latter sees much more intense photons with a rate up to 5 mhz .",
    "thus an accidental cancellation of systematic errors is expected to be uncommon .",
    "the result in turn gives good confidence to the monitoring method .",
    "in order to study photomultiplier s gain stability at high counting rate , we constructed an led pulsed light source and its output monitor system . for the monitor system , we employed a photon counting method .",
    "it samples a small portion of light output and measures single photon rates with a monitor photon detector .",
    "it thus monitors the relative light output from the source .",
    "it is virtually insensitive to the gain change of a monitor photon detector because , as long as the discrimination between the signal from background noise is clear , the rate of the single photon count remains constant .    in our actual setup ,",
    "we used a photomultiplier as a monitor photon detector .",
    "thermal ( random ) noises and after - pulses were found to be the two main backgrounds .",
    "we could make the errors due to these backgrounds sufficiently small ( @xmath34 ) by selecting a suitable photomultiplier and a operating condition .",
    "we tentatively assign @xmath35 as an absolute accuracy in this method .",
    "this accuracy was estimated by the method described in  4.1 .",
    "our direct application of this system was to investigate the gain stability of the photomultiplier ( r1398 ) used in our trigger counter .",
    "as shown in  4.2 , it was proved that the photomultiplier and base system could satisfy our requirements . at the same time",
    ", it is found that the photon counting method offers a simple way to monitor outputs from a pulsed light source .",
    "together with an led light source , it provides a handy way to investigate photomultiplier s gain stability at high counting rates .",
