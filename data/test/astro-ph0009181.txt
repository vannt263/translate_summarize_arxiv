    "during the last decade , a wealth of information was obtained on the close environment and , in particular , on the host galaxies of quasars , using both hubble space telescope ( hst , e.g. disney et al .",
    "1995 ; bahcall et al . 1997 ; boyce et al . 1998 ; mclure et al . 1999 ) and ground - based 4-m class telescopes ( e.g. mcleod & rieke 1994 , 1995 ; taylor et al .",
    "1996 ; kotilainen , falomo & scarpa 1998 ; kotilainen & falomo 2000 ; percival et al . 2000 ) .",
    "significant improvements in spatial resolution and instrumental efficiency have allowed the characterization of the properties ( mainly luminosity and scale - length ) of quasar hosts and , at least at low redshift ( z @xmath3 0.5 ) , to investigate in detail their morphology . at low redshift ( and to a lesser extent at intermediate redshift , 0.5 @xmath3 z @xmath3 1 ) ,",
    "it is now well established that the galaxies hosting these powerful agn are predominantly ellipticals or early - type spirals .",
    "radio - loud quasars ( rlq ) are almost exclusively found in galaxies dominated by the bulge ( spheroidal ) component .",
    "these luminous ellipticals exceed by @xmath223 mag the typical galaxy luminosity ( m@xmath5 25 ; mobasher , sharples & ellis 1993 ) , and are close to the brightest cluster galaxies ( m@xmath6 26 ; thuan & puschell 1989 ) . for radio - quiet quasars ( rqq ) ,",
    "the situation is less clear , with both types of hosts found .",
    "our present knowledge of quasar host galaxies is essentially limited to z @xmath3 1 ( see references above ) .",
    "this has enabled only a preliminary insight into the cosmological ( z  dependent ) quasar  host galaxy connection .",
    "this evolution should become much clearer in the redshift interval 1 @xmath3 z @xmath3 2 , since z@xmath22 is close to the epoch of the most vigorous nuclear activity when the host galaxies are still young .",
    "the observed reasonable similarity of the cosmic quasar evolution with the rate of galaxy formation ( e.g. franceshini et al 1999 ) may represent the overall effect of a fundamental link between massive galaxies and their nuclei , that has driven their formation history .",
    "deep high spatial resolution hst images of distant galaxies ( e.g. abraham et al .",
    "1996 ; koo et al .",
    "1996 ; le fevre et al .",
    "2000 ) have begun to trace the galaxy formation , while very little is still known about the evolution of distant quasar hosts .",
    "this is due to the very rapid increase with redshift in the difficulty of detecting quasar hosts , because of the ( 1+z)@xmath7 cosmological dimming of the surface brightness .",
    "consequently , only a few optical or near - infrared ( nir ) studies of rlq hosts at z @xmath8 1 have been conducted so far , either using conventional techniques ( e.g. lehnert et al .",
    "1992 , 1999 ; aretxaga et al . 1998 ) or , more recently , with adaptive optics ( e.g. hutchings et al .",
    "1999 ) , and suggest for rlqs extremely luminous hosts with very high star formation rates ( @xmath9 2000 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 ) that have no counterparts in the local universe ( e.g. tresse & maddox 1998 : treyer et al 1998 ) or in high redshift field galaxies ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "1996 ; lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 ) . on the other hand , similar studies of rqqs at z@xmath22.5 ( lowenthal et al .",
    "1995 ) were unable to resolve the hosts , suggesting they are at least 1 mag fainter than the rlq hosts , and indicating that the two types of quasars have distinct types of hosts , rather than being different only in their level of radio emission .",
    "the study of high redshift quasar host galaxies and their immediate environment is difficult , because of the often overwhelming brightness of the nucleus with respect to the host that becomes progressively fainter at a few arcsec from the nucleus .",
    "the two main requirements are , therefore , good spatial resolution ( narrow point spread function : psf ) and large collecting area of the telescope for the detection of faint diffuse features ( e.g. the host galaxy and close companions ) .",
    "we present here the results of a pilot study of nir imaging of three rlqs ( pks 0000 - 177 , pks 0348 - 120 and pks 0402 - 362 ) at z @xmath21.5 extracted from a list of quasars with redshift 1.0 @xmath3 z @xmath3 2.0 , -25.5 @xmath12 -28 and 60@xmath13 @xmath14 -8@xmath13 and with sufficiently bright stars within the field of view of the quasar for the characterization of the psf .",
    "hubble constant h@xmath15 = 50 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 and deceleration parameter q@xmath15 = 0 are used throughout this paper .",
    "nir @xmath0-band ( 1.65 @xmath1 m ) images of the quasars were obtained at the european southern observatory ( eso ) in paranal , chile , using the isaac camera ( cuby 2000 ) mounted on the first 8 m unit telescope ( ut1 ) of the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "the sw arm of isaac is equipped with a 1024 x 1024 px hawaii rockwell array , with pixel scale 0147 px@xmath11 , giving a field of view 150 x 150 arcsec ( corresponding to @xmath2 1.8 mpc at z = 1.5 ) .",
    "the observations were performed in service mode during the nights of 20 and 21 october 1999 .",
    "each quasar was observed for a total integration time of 1 hour using a jitter procedure and individual exposures of 2 minutes per frame .",
    "the jittered observations were controlled by an automatic template ( see cuby 2000 ) , which produced a set of frames slightly offset in telescope position from the starting point .",
    "the observed positions were randomly generated within a box of 10 x 10 arcsec centered on the first pointing .",
    "the seeing was very good during the observations , resulting in stellar fwhm of 050 , 041 and 038 in the fields of pks 0000 - 177 , pks 0348 - 120 and pks 0402 - 362 , respectively .",
    "each frame was flat - fielded and sky - subtracted and the final image was produced for each quasar by co - adding these frames .",
    "data reduction was performed by the eso pipeline for jitter imaging data ( devillard 2000 ) .",
    "the normalized flat field was obtained by subtracting on and off images of the illuminated dome , after interpolating over bad pixels .",
    "sky subtraction was done by median averaging sky frames from 10 frames nearest in time .",
    "the reduced frames were aligned to sub - pixel accuracy using a fast object detection algorithm , and co - added after removing any spurious pixel values .",
    "photometric calibration was performed against standard stars observed during the same night .",
    "the estimated internal photometric accuracy is @xmath40.03 mag .    in order to determine the amount of extended emission around the quasars",
    ", one needs to perform a detailed study of the psf .",
    "the relatively large field of view of isaac ( @xmath2 25 ) and the constraint on the selection of the quasars to have at least one sufficiently bright field star , allowed us to perform a reliable characterization of the psf . for each field , we analyzed the shape of many stellar profiles and constructed a composite psf , whose brightness profile extends down to @xmath16 = 24.5 mag arcsec@xmath17 .",
    "this warrants a reliable comparison between the luminosity profile of the quasars and of the stars without requiring extrapolation of the psf .",
    "the shape of the psf profile was found to be stable across the field of the images .    for each quasar",
    ", we have derived the azimuthally averaged fluxes excluding all regions around the quasars contaminated by companion objects .",
    "this procedure yielded for each quasar the radial luminosity profile out to a radius where the signal became indistinguishable from the background noise . for our observations",
    ", this level corresponds to @xmath1(h ) @xmath224 mag arcsec@xmath17 , typically reached at @xmath22@xmath18 distance from the nucleus .",
    "straightforward comparison of this profile with the scaled psf gives us a first indication of the amount of the extended emission .",
    "detailed modeling of the luminosity profile was then carried out using an iterative least - squares fit to the observed profile , assuming a combination of a point source ( psf ) and an elliptical galaxy described by de vaucouleurs law , convolved with the proper psf .",
    "we also attempted a fit using a pure exponential disk model for the host galaxy .",
    "note that the small extent of the hosts and the dominance of the nuclear emission made it impossible to discriminate between the two models .",
    "consistently with the properties of lower redshift rlqs , we have assumed the elliptical model for the determination of the host galaxy luminosities .",
    "if a disk model is assumed , the luminosities become @xmath20.2  0.3 mag fainter .",
    "this difference does not affect the main conclusions of this study .",
    "the basic properties and the derived parameters of the quasars are given in table 1 , where column ( 1 ) gives the name of the quasar , column ( 2 ) the redshift , columns ( 3 )  ( 4 ) the @xmath0-band apparent magnitude of the nucleus and the host , columns ( 5 ) ",
    "( 6 ) the @xmath0-band absolute magnitude of the nucleus and the host , and column ( 7 ) the scale - length of the host .",
    "absolute magnitudes have been k - corrected ( at this @xmath19 k - coor is @xmath3 0.2 mag in h ) ) using the optical - nir evolutionary synthesis model for elliptical galaxies ( poggianti 1997 ) .",
    "in fig . 1 , we show the final images of the three quasars together with their psf - subtracted images . the psf scaling factor was adjusted in order to prevent strong negative values in the few central pixels of the residual image .",
    "although this method tends to over - subtract the point source , it gives us a model - independent way to analyze the surrounding nebulosity .",
    "after the subtraction of the scaled psf , two out of the three quasars images exhibit clearly extended emission and suggest the presence of knotty structure . for one quasar ( pks 0402 - 362 ) , only marginal extended emission is detected .",
    "detailed results for individual quasars are reported below .",
    "the uncertainty on the host galaxy luminosity depends mainly on the relative emission and size of the nebulosity compared with that from the nucleus . in order to estimate the error on the host magnitude we fitted the profiles with variable values of host and derived the level at which the fit was unacceptable ( @xmath20 3 ) .",
    "based on this procedure , we estimate the uncertainty of the host galaxy magnitudes to be @xmath2 0.3 mag ( @xmath20.5 mag for pks 0402 - 362 ) , while the uncertainty on the scale - length may be as high as 50% .",
    "this quasar is located at @xmath24@xmath18 nw from an m@xmath21 @xmath214.5 mag star which , although well separated from the quasar , has been subtracted from the final image to avoid confusion . in our @xmath0-band image ( fig .",
    "1a ) , pks 0000 - 177 at z = 1.465 appears round and compact with a companion object at @xmath22@xmath18 sw . after removing this companion",
    ", we note faint `` arc - like '' structures to the ne and sw at @xmath215 from the nucleus , which , however , are not well visible in the image reproduction ( see fig 1a ) .",
    "after subtraction of a scaled psf ( fig .",
    "1b ) , extended emission is clearly detected .",
    "this nebulosity exhibits also a faint knot at @xmath2 06 e of the nucleus .",
    "this knot may be related to the double radio structure at 5 ghz , separated by @xmath207 along e - w direction ( aldcroft et al .",
    "1993 ) . after masking this companion we derived the brightness profile ( fig .",
    "2a ) that exhibits a significant excess over the scaled psf , starting at @xmath21@xmath18 ( 12 kpc ) radius from the nucleus .",
    "modeling of this profile shows that the extended emission corresponds to a host galaxy with m@xmath21 = 27.4 and r(e ) @xmath2 3.5 kpc .",
    "a companion galaxy ( m@xmath21 = 20.3 ) is visible at 18 distance sw of the quasar .",
    "if it is at the redshift of the quasar , its projected distance is @xmath221 kpc and its absolute magnitude is m@xmath21 = 25.8 .",
    "pks 0348 - 120 is a flat spectrum radio quasar at z = 1.520 ( wright et al .",
    "nir photometry by wright et al .",
    ", j = 17.7 and k = 16.1 , is consistent with our h = 17.1 .",
    "the @xmath0-band image of the quasar ( fig .",
    "1c ) is clearly extended and elongated approximately along ne - sw direction .",
    "a resolved companion galaxy ( g1 ) with m@xmath21 = 20.5 lies at 22 ne from the quasar . the projected distance of this galaxy ,",
    "if at the redshift of the quasar , is 27 kpc .",
    "another , fainter galaxy ( g2 ) with m@xmath21 = 21.1 is situated at 32 ( 39 kpc ) sw , while a much fainter extended emission ( g3 ; m@xmath21 = 22.2 ) is visible at 39 ( 43 kpc ) w of the quasar .",
    "modeling of the radial brightness profile ( fig .",
    "2b ) confirms that this quasar is well resolved and its host galaxy is very luminous ( m@xmath21 = 27.6 ) and compact ( r(e ) = 4.9 kpc ) .",
    "the profile is not smooth , suggesting the presence of substructure in the host .",
    "straightforward subtraction of a scaled psf ( fig .",
    "1d ) reveals a knot at 07 ( 8.6 kpc ) from the nucleus along the direction of g1 .",
    "this feature is better emphasized in the deconvolved image of the quasar ( see inset in fig .",
    "1c ) using a lucy - richardson algorithm implemented in iraf ( lucy 1991 ) with 15 iterations . with the present data ,",
    "it is not possible to clarify the nature of this circumnuclear emission knot .",
    "most likely , it is another small companion galaxy projected onto the envelope of the quasar host , but higher spatial resolution images ( either from space or from ground with adaptive optic ) will be necessary to reveal its morphological details .",
    "although pks 0402 - 362 is at about the same redshift ( z = 1.417 ) as the other quasars in this study , its nucleus is @xmath22 mag brighter .",
    "our photometry ( h = 15.1@xmath40.1 ) is comparable with h = 14.9@xmath40.2 measured by peterson et al .",
    "( 1976 ) . the @xmath0-band image of this quasar is shown in fig .",
    "the nuclear luminosity is very high , m(h ) = 30.6 , and it out - shines the light from the host galaxy .",
    "after subtraction of the scaled psf ( fig .",
    "1f ) , no significant extended emission is detected .",
    "using azimuthally averaged radial brightness profile , we substantially improved the signal - to - noise and found a small excess of light over the psf starting from 1@xmath18 distance from the nucleus ( fig . 2c ) .",
    "modeling of this profile , assuming it is due to an elliptical galaxy , yields a host luminosity of m(h ) = 27.7 and scale - length r(e ) @xmath2 4 kpc . comparison of various stellar profiles in the field indicates that this light excess is real .",
    "however , since it is small , we consider this only a marginal host detection .",
    "the uncertainty of the host galaxy luminosity is @xmath20.5 mag .",
    "we detect a companion galaxy with m@xmath21 = 19.5 at 28 sw from the quasar .",
    "assuming it is at the same redshift as the quasar , its projected distance is 34 kpc , and it appears to be very luminous ( m@xmath21 = -26.6 ; only 1 mag fainter than the quasar host ) .",
    "note , however , that the optical spectrum of the quasar exhibits a weak absorption system tentatively identified as mgii 2800   at z = 0.797 ( surdej & swings 1981 ) which , if associated with the companion galaxy , would lead to a reduced m(h ) = -24.5 .",
    "we have presented deep , high spatial resolution ( fwhm @xmath3 05 ) nir images of three high redshift rlqs . in all three cases ,",
    "we are able to resolve the quasar , although for pks 0402 - 362 only marginally .",
    "the detected extended emission is most naturally interpreted as due to starlight from the galaxies hosting the quasars .",
    "the derived nir host luminosities ( m@xmath6 27.5 ) are very bright and correspond to galaxies @xmath8 2 mag brighter than m@xmath22 ( m@xmath21 = 25 ; mobasher et al .",
    "the nuclei are @xmath21.5 mag ( @xmath23 mag for pks 0402 - 362 ) more luminous than their host galaxies .",
    "the scale - length of the hosts ranges from 3 to 5 kpc and appear to be smaller than those observed in low ( z @xmath3 0.5 ) and intermediate ( 0.5 @xmath3 z @xmath3 1 ) redshift quasar hosts ( e.g. mcleod & rieke 1994 ; taylor et al .",
    "1996 ; mclure et al .",
    "1999 ; kotilainen et al .",
    "1998 ; kotilainen & falomo 2000 ) , which typically have scale - lengths @xmath210 kpc .",
    "this is similar behavior to what is found in early - type galaxies in the hdf - n ( e.g. fasano et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the luminosities of the host galaxies of our three rlqs are very similar to those of high redshift 6c radio galaxies ( rg ) studied by eales et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in their hubble diagram ,",
    "rgs at z @xmath21.5 have @xmath23-band magnitude @xmath218.5 , while we find @xmath3 m@xmath24(host ) @xmath8 @xmath218.3 ( assuming h ",
    "k = 0.2 ) .",
    "the similarity with high @xmath19 rgs is also supported by the knotty structure observed in the hosts of two of the quasars and in the density of the immediate environment ( cf e.g. best longair and rttgering 1997 ) .",
    "assuming a standard passive stellar evolution of the host galaxies , we expect that in the @xmath0-band luminous ellipticals at z @xmath21.5 should be @xmath21.4 mag brighter than ellipticals at the present epoch ( poggianti 1997 ) .",
    "the hosts of these quasars therefore would correspond to still very luminous ( m@xmath21 @xmath2 26 ) early - type galaxies at z = 0 .",
    "similarly high luminosities have been found for rlq hosts at redshifts z @xmath3 0.5 ( e.g. mcleod & rieke 1994 ; taylor et al .",
    "1996 ; mclure et al . 1999 ) and at 0.5@xmath251 ( m(h ) @xmath227 ; kotilainen falomo & scarpa 1998 ; kotilainen & falomo 2000 ) .",
    "these results underline a passive evolutionary scenario for rlq and rg hosts that appears significantly different from that of rqq hosts .",
    "in fact a recent study of rqqs at z @xmath21.8 and z @xmath22.7 , performed with hst and nicmos in the @xmath0-band , was able to resolve 4 out of 5 rqqs ( ridgway et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the deduced host luminosities appear 1 - 2 mag fainter than those found in our rlq hosts and in the 6c rgs ( eales et al .",
    "1997 ) , and are similar to m*. this suggests that the systematic difference of host luminosity between rlqs and rqqs , already noted at low redshift ( e.g. bahcall et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) , is even more significant at higher redshift , possibly indicating a different formation and/or evolutionary history of the two types of agn depending on whether or not they can develop radio emission .",
    "models of galaxy formation and evolution based on hierarchical clustering ( e.g. kauffmann & hhnelt 2000 ) predict progressively less luminous host galaxies for quasars at high redshift .",
    "this seems to be in agreement with the observations of high @xmath19 rqq hosts ( ridgway et al . 2000 ; hutchings 1995 ) , which may still be undergoing major mergers to evolve into the low redshift giant ellipticals , or do not significantly evolve to become low @xmath19 m * galaxies .",
    "this contrasts with our results on high @xmath19 rlqs and with previous indications that rlq hosts at @xmath19 = 2 - 3 are extremely luminous ( lehnert et al .",
    "1992 ) and have no counterpart in the local universe . on the other hand , similarly to our results , ridgway et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that the hosts of rqqs are compact ( scale - length @xmath2 4 kpc ) and show high frequency of close companions .",
    "the combined comparison of the host galaxy properties of rlqs in the redshift interval 0.1 @xmath3 z @xmath3 1.5 thus suggests a scenario where luminous agn live in very luminous massive galaxies whose star formation rate and evolution appear indistinguishable from those expected for a ( normal ) non - active elliptical galaxy .",
    "the large - scale environments of the three quasars observed do not appear particularly rich in galaxies with respect to the background .",
    "there is no evidence of a rich cluster of galaxies around any of the quasars .",
    "however , in all three cases we have detected a companion galaxy of m@xmath21 @xmath2 20@xmath41 at a distance from the quasar @xmath3 3@xmath18 ( 40 kpc ) .",
    "based on the counts of 46 resolved objects detected in the images we derive an average density of galaxies with 19@xmath26 23 ( corresponding to m@xmath22 - 2 @xmath27 m@xmath22 + 1 at z @xmath21.5 ) , in the 1 mpc projected area around the quasar , of 11 galaxies arcmin@xmath17 . we thus expect to find a chance projection of @xmath20.3 companions in the three fields within 3@xmath18 from the quasar .",
    "the poissonian probability of finding 3 such companions is p = 0.003 .",
    "this indicates that the observed companions are likely related to the quasars .",
    "close companion galaxies around quasars have been noted since the first systematic imaging studies of quasars ( e.g. hutchings & neff 1990 ; hutchings 1995 ; bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ; hutchings et al . 1999 ) and spectroscopic investigations have shown that , at least in the case of the closest companions , they are often galaxies at the same redshift of the quasars ( e.g. heckman et al . 1984 ; ellingson et al . 1994 ; canalizo & stockton 1997 ) . for example , in the hst study of 20 nearby quasars , bahcall et al . (",
    "1997 ) found a high frequency of close ( @xmath3 25 kpc ) companions .",
    "their intrinsic luminosities ( assuming the redshift of the quasar ) ranges from m@xmath28 @xmath2 18.5 to m@xmath28 @xmath2 22.5 .",
    "if the companions observed around the three quasars in this study are at the redshift of the quasars , their luminosities are quite high ( m@xmath21 @xmath2 24.5  26.5 ) .",
    "this is similar to the results at low redshift ( bahcall et al . ) if a modest amount ( @xmath21.3 mag ) of galaxy evolution is taken into account and a typical ( v  h @xmath2 3.5 ) galaxy color is used .",
    "somewhat less luminous companion galaxies seem to occur around bl lac objects ( falomo et al 2000 ) but a larger statistic is needed to draw a sound conclusion on this point .    * acknowledgments . * + this work was partly supported by the italian ministry for university and research ( murst ) under grant cofin98 - 02 - 32 and cofin 98 - 02 - 15 .",
