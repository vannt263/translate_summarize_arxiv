    "intensive investigations by many experimentalists and theorists have already revealed main metallic and superconducting properties of this group of materials .    from band calculations@xcite , it is agreed on that the 3d electrons of fe atoms are the main contributors to the conduction bands crossing the fermi surface ( fs ) . besides the degree of degeneracy",

    "regarding the pairing symmetry , there are already many experiments : ( 1 ) knight shift below @xmath3 shows a clear drop indicating a spin singlet pairing @xcite ; ( 2 ) tunneling spectroscopy @xcite showed the zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) - signature of a sign changing gap , but the interpretation of the shape of density of states ( dos ) @xmath6 is diverse ; ( 3 ) nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath2 @xcite unanimously showed no coherent peak and @xmath7 dependence below @xmath3 , hence strongly suggesting a d - wave type gap ; and ( 4 ) specific - heat coefficient @xmath8 below @xmath3 ( ref .",

    "all these experiments appear to be consistent with a d - wave type gap .",
    "however , recent penetration depth measurements with prfeaso , sm(of)feas and nd(of)feas ( ref.@xcite ) strongly suggest a fully opened gap at low temperatures indicating a s - wave type pairing symmetry .    regarding the paring glues , the phonon interaction appears unlikely mainly because the electron - phonon coupling is estimated to be very weak ( @xmath10)@xcite . on the other hand , this series of materials , without doping , commonly has a spin density wave ( sdw ) transition at around @xmath11 k. when the superconductivity appears with doping , the sdw correlation is expected to remain , albeit the long range order disappears",
    "recent neutron - scattering experiments with la(of)feas and ce(of)feas ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) directly measured the antiferromagnetic ( afm)-type correlation of the fe d - electron spin moment .",
    "the overall phase diagram with doping for ce(of)feas reveals a close correlation with an antiferromagnetism and superconductivity , suggesting the important role of magnetic fluctuations as a pairing glue .",
    "it also shows that the generic phase diagram of these compounds shares the universal features with the high-@xmath3 cuprates , pu-115 superconductor @xcite , and various heavy fermion superconductors ; namely , the sc occurs in the neighborhood of the magnetic long range order when this magnetic order is suppressed . in particular",
    ", the magnetic order is an afm type .",
    "this universal phase diagram is very tantalizing because it appears to cover a wide class of unconventional sc materials with a range of @xmath3 from a few mk to 100 k and suggests that the afm fluctuation is a common thread and its characteristic energy roughly scales with the sc @xmath3 @xcite .    for the fe - based sc materials ,",
    "several theoretical models were already proposed and most of them started with the orbital basis of the fe 3d - electrons including hubbard @xmath12 interaction(s ) and hund coupling(s ) @xmath13 @xcite . some of these studies @xcite found that the @xmath0s - wave gap as a dominant instability .",
    "a d - wave gap also often appears as a second instability @xcite . in this paper , we took a phenomenological approach to investigate possible pairing states in the fe - pnitide superconductors .",
    "the non - interacting part of hamiltonian is constructed by choosing a minimal set of topologically distinct two bands and the interaction part of hamiltonian is assumed from the experimental input @xcite , simulating a short range afm correlation . by solving the coupled bcs gap equations , we found the two sc gap solutions : a sign - changing s - wave gap and a double d - wave gap .",
    "for the both sc states , we carried out the calculations of the sc properties such as the dos , temperature dependencies of the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath2 , knight shift , and penetration depth .",

    ", we observe that several band structure calculations @xcite of the fe - pnictide compounds reached the consensus that the fs of the doped compounds consists of two hole pockets and two electron pockets . to keep the essential physics , but avoiding unnecessary complexity , we choose only two topologically distinct bands : one hole band around @xmath4 point ( 0,0 ) and one electron band around @xmath5 point ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the main phenomenological assumption of our model is the interacting part of hamiltonian .",
    "this pairing interaction @xmath17 is chosen to simulate a short range afm spin fluctuations peaking at the ordering wave vector @xmath18 .",
    "this assumption is directly motivated by the experimental observations of the afm correlation in the fe - pnictide compounds by the neutron - scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "the elastic neutron - scattering experiments for la(f@xmath19o@xmath20)feas and ce(f@xmath19o@xmath20)feas by dai and co - workers @xcite showed the long - range afm order of the fe3d - electron spins for the doping range of @xmath21 .",
    "when this long - range afm order disappears beyond the doping around x=0.05 , sc appears up to the doping range x @xmath22 0.2 ( this is only the limit of the measured data ) .",
    "this overall phase diagram appears to be generic for the fe - pnictides , and clearly shows that the afm correlation is the dominant magnetic correlation in this group of materials .",
    "more importantly , this afm correlation is expected to continue to exist in the doping range where the sc phase occurs albeit becoming a short - rang one .",
    "this speculation is supported by more recent inelastic neutron - scattering experiment in the doped ( bak)fe@xmath23as@xmath23 compound ( @xmath3=38k ) by christianson et al .",
    "@xcite in this experiment , a clear magnetic - resonance peak is observed at the expected position of the afm correlation , i.e. , at ( @xmath24 ) momentum . with this series of experiments",
    "it is clear that the afm correlation is the dominant magnetic correlation in the fe - pnictides among other competing magnetic correlations such as weak ferromagnetism @xcite , checkerboard afm @xcite , and afm stripe phase @xcite , which were theoretically proposed .",
    "finally , the coupling matrix element is assumed to be a constant for simplicity .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the electron creation operators on the hole and the electron bands , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 are the dispersions of the hole band and electron bands , respectively , defined as @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in this paper , we choose the band parameters as ( 0.30,0.24,-0.6 ) for hole band and ( 1.14,0.74,1.70 ) for electron band with the notation ( @xmath31 ) @xcite .",
    "the pairing interaction @xmath32 is phenomenologically defined below .",
    "it is all repulsive in momentum space and it represents a short range afm spin fluctuations as explained above .    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the two- dimensional momenta on the two dimensional bz and the parameter",
    "@xmath36 controls the magnetic correlation length as @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the unit - cell distance ) .",
    "this interaction mediates the strongest repulsion when two momenta @xmath34 and @xmath35 are spanned by the ordering wave vector @xmath39 .",
    "this condition is better fulfilled when the two momenta @xmath34 and @xmath35 reside each other on different bands in the model band structure ( see fig.1 ) . as a result ,",
    "the sign - changing s - wave gap can form on each band as already suggested by several papers @xcite . however , this opposite sign gap on the hole and electron bands is not limited with the @xmath0s - wave state ( [ fig.1 ( a ) ] .",
    "another possibility , which conforms to the lattice symmetry , is that each band develops a d - wave gap but with @xmath40 phase shift between two bands [ fig.1 ( b ) ] .",
    "we call this type of gap as double d - wave gap .",
    "we need to mention that our model did not include the screened coulomb interaction ( neither did the other theoretical investigations @xcite ) , which certainly exists in the fe - pnitide superconductors as well as in all metals in general .",
    "the screened coulomb interaction is traditionally treated as `` coulomb pseudo potential '' @xmath41 in the conventional phonon- driven sc . however , the reliable estimate for its strength is practically impossible because even a small difference in @xmath41 would cause a large change in @xmath3 . in the fe - pnictides ,",
    "if we are to determine @xmath3 theoretically , a quantitative estimate of @xmath41 is necessary .",
    "we did not include it in our model interaction , first , because we do not know how to reliably estimate it in these compounds and , second , because the primary purpose of the present paper is not the prediction of the precise @xmath3 .",
    "still we could investigate its generic effects on the different pairing symmetries such as @xmath0 s - wave and double d - wave gaps ; for example , how large value of @xmath41 is necessary to kill the @xmath0 s - wave pairing for a given strength of the afm interaction .",
    "we think that this kind of analysis will dilute the focus of the present paper and therefore should be a separate investigation .",
    "we briefly remark , however , on the general effects of the screened coulomb interaction .",
    "the screened coulomb interaction becomes a short - range interaction in real space and therefore weakly momentum dependent in momentum space .",
    "this type of interaction is almost harmless for the d - wave type pairing but extremely detrimental for the s - wave type pairing .",
    "the pairing solutions in this paper should be considered with this point in mind .",
    "now we solve the hamiltonian eq.(1 ) using the bcs approximation and the two band electrons need two sc order parameters ( ops )    @xmath42    after decoupling the interaction terms of eq.(1 ) using the above ops , the self - consistent mean field conditions lead to the following two coupled gap equations .",

    "also no restriction on the functional forms of the gaps @xmath59 was imposed except the general symmetry depicted in fig.1 , so that the @xmath50-dependence of the gap functions @xmath60 will follow the characteristics of the bands and pairing interaction .",
    "as explained in sec .",
    "ii , the main pairing process with the afm spin - fluctuation mediated interaction @xmath55 is the interband pair hopping between the hole and the electron bands , in which a pair of electrons @xmath61 on the hole band scatters to a pair of electrons @xmath62 on the electron band and vice versa .",
    "this process is particularly dominant when the size of the fs of each band is much smaller than the size of @xmath39 vector . considering only this interband pair process [ keeping only @xmath63 and @xmath64 terms in eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) ] , we observe the fact that the pair potential @xmath65 for the hole band electrons is provided by the pairs of electrons in the electron band and vice versa .",
    "the physical consequence of it is that the relative sizes of the gaps and doss on each band are reversed ; namely , if @xmath66 , then @xmath67 holds in general .",
    "this relation holds both for the @xmath0s - wave and for the double d - wave gap solutions and affects all superconducting properties such as tunneling dos , knight shift , @xmath2 , and penetration depth .    for all numerical calculations in this paper ,",
    "we choose the parameters @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 ( average interaction @xmath72 ) .",
    "our choice of band parameters produces @xmath73 and @xmath74 so that @xmath75 .",
    "we think that these numbers represent the fe - based sc materials but should not be taken too seriously ; in particular the pairing strength @xmath71 is chosen freely for demonstration .",
    "this solution for the fe - based sc is already proposed by several authors @xcite here we demonstrate that this solution is indeed realized with a simple phenomenological interaction , which mimics an afm spin fluctuations , on the minimal two band model representing the fe - based sc compounds .    as we described above , the reversed relation between the magnitude of the doss and the size of gaps holds more rigorously for the s - wave case and we suggest an approximate relation @xmath76 ( see the appendix for more detailed discussions ) .",
    "this relation is a generic feature of the model .",
    "therefore , given a substantial difference of dos between the hole and electron bands ( several band calculations @xcite indicate that this is true for the fe - based sc materials ) , at least two distinctively different sizes of the sc gaps should be observed in various experiments @xcite . in particular , because the band with a larger dos would dominate the physical properties but actually holds a smaller gap , this feature will modify various sc properties of the fe - based sc in unorthodox manner , such as @xmath77 value , temperature dependencies of various sc properties below @xmath3 , and the responses to impurities .",

    "[ fig2],width=302 ]    in fig.2 , the solution of the @xmath0s - wave gap and the corresponding dos are shown . as mentioned , @xmath83 for our bands .",
    "accordingly the size of gaps of the hole band and the electron band is reversed as @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the strongly momentum dependent pairing interaction and the realistic bands naturally induce an anisotropic modulation of the s - wave gaps with @xmath86 symmetry ; the modulation is stronger for the larger gap on the smaller dos band ( electron band around @xmath5 point ) .",
    "compared to the case of the double d - wave solution , the average size of the @xmath0s - wave gap is larger by a factor of @xmath87 with the same pairing potential . therefore",
    ", unless some other interactions are added , the ground state of our model is the @xmath0s - wave sc state .",
    "this conclusion is already obtained by other authors @xcite with different models and approaches .",
    "the separate and total doss plotted in fig.2(b ) show the main features of the @xmath0s - wave gap : two peak structure , the large dos with a small gap and the small dos with a large gap .",
    "the overall shape of the total dos is not very much revealing compared to the current tunneling dos measurements @xcite .",
    "however , it is too early to make a decisive conclusion with our calculations without including andreev scattering .",
    "also the zbcp , the hallmark of a d - wave gap and observed in experiments with the fe - based superconductors @xcite , can equally be obtained with the @xmath0s - wave gap state .",
    "we consider nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath2 for the @xmath0s - wave gap .",
    "several groups @xcite have reported that @xmath2 shows no coherence peak and the @xmath88 power law below @xmath3 , strongly suggesting an unconventional gap with lines of node such as a d - wave gap .",
    "s - wave gap is known to have a constructive coherent factors for @xmath2 to induce the coherence peak over a temperature range below @xmath3 .",

    "the overall features of @xmath2 are the ones of the typical d - wave sc state : no coherence peak near @xmath3 and @xmath135 below @xmath3 , and consistent with the current nmr experiments @xcite . at very low temperatures ,",
    "t - linear behavior starts to appear due to a small damping for the numerical calculations ( @xmath136 ) . for comparison",
    ", we also show @xmath134 ( open green circles ) with @xmath137 = 1.0 , a smaller gap-@xmath3 ratio ; it exhibits a substantial convex part below @xmath3 and then starts displaying the universal @xmath88 behavior before entering the impurity dominating region .    in fig.8",
    ", we show the result of the uniform spin susceptibility which is measured as knight shift .",
    "fig.8(a ) shows the results with @xmath125 .",
    "the hole band contribution is dominant as in @xmath2 and the electron band contribution show the steeper drop just below @xmath3 because of the larger gap-@xmath3 ratio @xmath138 .",
    "the overall behavior of the total @xmath139 below @xmath3 shows a typical d - wave behavior such as @xmath9-linear at low temperatures .",
    "fig.8(b ) shows the results with @xmath140 .",
    "a smaller gap-@xmath3 ratio makes the knight shift convex as in the @xmath0s - wave case and observed by matano et al.@xcite for pr(fo)feas .",
    "this result demonstrates that this convex behavior of knight shift is irrelevant to the gap symmetry but a generic feature of the two - gap ( or multigap ) sc .",
    "but it reveals that the gap-@xmath3 ratio @xmath141 is much smaller than the standard bcs value , where @xmath142 refers to the gap of the band with largest dos .",
    "now we calculate the penetration depth . as we discussed in sec.ii , most of experiments , up to now , report a flat temperature dependence of @xmath143 at low - temperature region and suggest a fully gapped sc state @xcite .",
    "a naive double d - wave gap state has no chance to explain this flat behavior at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , we consider a non - local effect of the electromagnetic response of the double d - wave gap superconductor as a possible cause to modify the typical temperature dependence . in order to include the effect of the non - local electrodynamics",
    ", we use the fully @xmath144dependent kernel @xmath145 [ eq.(10 ) ] and put it into the integral formula for @xmath146 with the specular boundary condition ,    @xmath147    where @xmath148 are the normalized kernels as @xmath149 and @xmath150 is a dimensionless momentum .",
    "the results with a diffusive boundary condition are qualitatively the same ; therefore , they will not be discussed . for the non - local parameter @xmath117",
    ", we think it to be much smaller than 1 for the fe - based superconductors , but here we take it as a free parameter and see how large value is needed to fit experimental data .",
    "fig.9 and fig.10 show the normalized total superfluidity density @xmath151 and separate contributions from the hole and electron bands for the double d - wave gap state .",
    "fig.9 used @xmath152=1.75 and fig.10 used @xmath153=1.0 . in each figure , panel ( a ) is a local limit ( @xmath154 ) and the panel ( b ) is a non - local limit ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "the local cases display the typical d - wave behavior at low temperatures , i.e. , the linear decrease in @xmath9 from @xmath156 .",
    "the extreme non - local cases ( @xmath157 ) introduce a substantial round - off ( @xmath158 ) region at low temperatures , which is , however , not an exponentially flat behavior as the recent experiments claim .",
    "further , even a rough fitting requires an unreasonably large non - local parameter @xmath117 .     of double d - wave gap and its separate contributions from the hole and electron bands with @xmath159 .",
    "( a ) @xmath160 and ( b ) @xmath117 = 0.5 .",

    "( a ) @xmath160 ; ( b ) @xmath117 = 0.5 .",
    "[ fig10],width=302 ]    in summary , the double d - wave gap state can provide consistent descriptions for tunneling dos , @xmath2 , and knight shift .",
    "however , there is an intrinsic difficulty to explain the flat behavior of the penetration depth at low temperatures .",
    "also , in our model with an afm mediated pairing interaction only , the double d - wave gap solution is energetically less favored than the @xmath0s - wave gap solution .",
    "we demonstrated that a minimal model with a phenomenological pairing interaction of the afm spin fluctuations can allow both the @xmath0s - wave gap and the double d - wave gap solutions with the realistic bands of the fe - based sc compounds . with the same parameters ,",
    "the @xmath0s - wave gap solution is energetically more favorable by a factor of @xmath225 times , so that it has a better chance to be realized in the fe - based sc compounds .    in both cases",
    ", we found that the approximate relation @xmath76 holds because it is a generic feature of the two gap sc when an interband pair scattering is the dominant pairing interaction .",
    "this relation appears for all sc properties in subtle way , which modifies the value of @xmath162 and other sc properties in unorthodox way . numerically solving the coupled gap equations for the two bands",
    ", we found the detailed structure of the gap functions @xmath163 , which showed an anisotropy ( @xmath22 20 @xmath164 ) of the @xmath0s - wave gaps .",
    "we also calculated the key sc properties , for both gap states , such as tunneling dos , @xmath2 , knight shift , and penetration depth and discussed them in comparison with experiments .",
    "when we calculated these quantities , we paid a special attention to the interband coherence factor which is a unique feature of multigap sc .",
    "this interband coherence factor particularly produced an important modification to the @xmath2 relaxation rate of the @xmath0s - wave gap state .",
    "the @xmath0s - wave gap state provides the most consistent descriptions for the penetration depth experiments : the flat low- temperature behavior.@xcite besides the low - temperature behavior , the high - temperature ( 0.3 @xmath165 ) behavior  due to a large difference of the gap sizes @xmath166 and @xmath167 and their corresponding dos @xmath168  can be either concave or convex .",
    "however , @xmath2 experiments can only be fitted for a limited temperature range , even with a fine tuning of @xmath124 ratio and impurities .",
    "the @xmath0s - wave gap state is not inconsistent with the knight shift and the tunneling dos data , but overall does not provide any decisive merit in comparison with the double d - wave gap .    the double d - wave gap state , although it is energetically less favorable in our model unless additional interactions are added , provides the best fit to the @xmath2 experiments .",
    "however , it has a difficulty to explain the penetration depth experiments for the low temperature flat behavior .",
    "it requires an unreasonably large non - local effect to fit the low temperature part ; it is still not exponentially flat but only @xmath158 .",
    "if this low temperature part of @xmath146 is , indeed , confirmed to be exponentially flat , the double d - wave gap state should be ruled out .",
    "tunneling dos and knight shift can be fit with the double d - wave gap state as much as with the @xmath0s - wave gap state",
    ".    in conclusion , quantitative calculations , carried out in this paper , with the two most promising sc gap states can serve as guidelines for sorting out the possible pairing states of the fe - based sc in comparison with the current and future experiments .",
    "for that , very low temperature measurements and systematic studies with the amount of impurities will provide decisive information to determine the correct gap symmetry .",
    "_ note added  _ recently , we have known that similar studies of @xmath2 for the @xmath0s - wave state were carried out by two groups @xcite where only the interband scattering process was analyzed and by another recent paper @xcite where both the interband and intraband processes were considered as in our paper .",
    "this work was supported by the kosef through the grants no .",
    "krf-2007 - 070-c00044 , and no .",
    "krf-2007 - 521-c00081 .",
    "the bottom baseline is @xmath171 and the top baseline is @xmath170 .",
    "[ fig1],width=340 ]    in the main text , we claimed the approximate relation @xmath172 as a generic feature of the two- band model with a dominant interband interaction .",
    "this kind of relation will have direct and important implications to the experimental observations .",
    "however it is pointed out by mazin @xcite that this is not a rigorous identity in general . in this appendix",
    ", we clarify the degree of the validity of this relation .",
    "in general , these equations do not yield a simple algebraic relation between @xmath184 and @xmath170 , but we can obtain the simple relations for the limiting cases .",
    "first , for the extreme weak coupling limit , ie .",
    ", when @xmath185 , the two logarithmic terms become asymptotically equal as @xmath186 , and we obtain the same relation as the @xmath178 case eq.(a.5 ) . on the other hand , for strong - coupling limit ,",
    ", when @xmath187 ( which is certainly an unphysical limit ) , @xmath188/\\delta_{h , e } ) \\approx \\omega_{afm}/\\delta_{h , e}$ ] and we obtain the relation ,      having found the results of the two limiting cases , we can guess that the gap ratio @xmath184 should be in between these two limiting ratios .",
    "for example , we can attempt an expansion with @xmath190}$ ] starting from the weak coupling limit @xcite , and we obtain , in the first order of @xmath191 ,      where @xmath193 is a dimensionless coupling constant . for practical use , we numerically solve eqs .",
    "( a.1 ) and eq.(a.2 ) and plot the ratio @xmath194 as a function of @xmath195 in fig.a.1 .",
    "the ratio @xmath184 becomes a universal curve when it is normalized by the distance between @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "the result indeed shows that when @xmath198 , it is in between two limiting ratios , @xmath196 and @xmath197 as we expected from the above analysis .    in reality ,",
    "there exist two complications .",
    "first , the intraband couplings @xmath199 and @xmath200 need to be included . a little analysis of eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) as well as of numerical results reveals that this effect always enhances the gap ratio toward the limit @xmath197 .",
    "another complication arises from the fact that there are more than two bands in real materials @xcite . applying the results of the above analysis",
    ", we can suggest the following approximate relations .",
    "first , we classify the bands of the real materials into two groups : the hole bands around @xmath4 point and the electron bands around @xmath5 point , respectively . then in the strong - coupling limit ,              g. f. chen , z. li , d. wu , g. li , w.z .",
