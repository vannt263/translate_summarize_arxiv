    "the study of critical phenomena occurring in adsorbed overlayers is a topic that has attracted increasing attention @xcite .",
    "in fact , the understanding of the behavior of atoms and molecules absorbed on different surfaces is essential for many branches of science ( chemistry , physics , biology , etc ) . within this wide context ,",
    "surface phenomena occurring under non - equilibrium conditions are far from being understood .",
    "therefore , they have become the center of great attention @xcite . in particular ,",
    "irreversible catalytic reactions exhibit a very rich and complex behavior that includes oscillations , bifurcations , chaos metastability , irreversible phase transitions ( ipt s ) , etc . @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to perform an extensive numerical study of the first - order ipt characteristic of a model for the @xmath1 reaction early proposed by yaldran and khan ( yk ) @xcite .",
    "ipt s in reactive systems take place between an active regime with sustained outcome of the reaction product from the catalytic surface and an absorbing ( or poisoned ) state where the catalyst becomes fully covered by one or more types of reactants . since the systems can not escape from the absorbing state the transitions are irreversible @xcite .",
    "the study of ipt s has gained increasing attention in the field of nonequilibrium statistical physics since the pioneering work of ziff , gulari and barshad ( zgb ) that introduced a simple lattice model for the catalytic oxidation of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting are first - order ipt s that can be characterized by an abrupt change in the density of reactants and in the rate of production due to a tiny change in the ( external ) control parameter , which is usually the pressure .",
    "in fact , evidence of such kind of transition has been reported in catalyzed reactions @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of hysteretic effects around a first - order transition point has also been observed @xcite .",
    "very recently , we have performed a detailed study of the first - order ipt of the zgb model presenting conclusive evidence of hysteretic effects @xcite . as anticipated above",
    ", the aim of this work is to characterize the first order ipt of the yk model @xcite for the @xmath0 reactions by means of monte carlo simulations with particular emphasis on the occurrence of hysteretic effects and by performing useful comparisons with our previous study of the zgb model @xcite .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the yk model and three different simulation methods used in the work , namely the standard ensemble , the constant coverage ensemble and the epidemic approach . in section",
    "iii we present and discuss the obtained results , while our conclusions are stated in section iv .",
    "yaldran and khan @xcite have proposed a lattice gas model for the catalytic reaction of @xmath0 based on the langmuir - hinshelwood mechanism . the reaction steps are as follows :    @xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6    where @xmath7 represents an unoccupied site on the catalyst surface , @xmath8 represents a nearest neighbor ( nn ) pair of such sites , @xmath9 indicates a molecule in the gas phase and @xmath10 indicates an species adsorbed on the catalyst .",
    "the reactions given by equations ( [ reco ] ) and ( [ ren ] ) are assumed to be instantaneous ( infinity reaction rate limit ) while the limiting steps are the adsorption events given by equations ( [ noad ] ) and ( [ coad ] ) .",
    "the yk model is similar to the zgb model for the @xmath11 reaction , except that the @xmath12 is replaced by @xmath13 , and nn @xmath14 atoms , as well as nn @xmath15 pairs , react . for further details on the yk model",
    "see @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations are performed on the hexagonal ( triangular ) lattice of side l , assuming periodic boundary conditions . in the standard ensemble",
    "the procedure is as follow : let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be the relative impingement rates for @xmath13 and @xmath2 , respectively , which are taken to be proportional to their partial pressures in the gas phase",
    ". taking @xmath18 , such normalization implies that the yk model has a single parameter that is usually taken to be @xmath17 . @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath13 adsorption events are selected at random with probabilities @xmath17 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "subsequently , an empty site of the lattice is also selected at random .",
    "if the selected species is @xmath2 , the adsorption on the empty site occurs according to equation ( [ coad ] ) .",
    "if the selected molecule is @xmath13 , a nn site of the previously selected one is also chosen at random , and if such site is empty the adsorption event takes place according to equation ( [ noad ] ) .",
    "of course , if the nn chosen site is occupied the adsorption trial is rejected .",
    "after each successful adsorption event all nn sites of the adsorbed species are checked at random for the occurrence of the reaction events described by equations ( [ reco ] ) and ( [ ren ] ) .",
    "the monte carlo time step ( mcs ) involves @xmath20 adsorption attempts , so that every site of the lattice is selected once , on average .",
    "simulations are started with empty lattices .",
    "the first @xmath21 mcs are disregarded to allow the system to reach the stationary regime and subsequently , averages are taken over @xmath22 x @xmath21 mcs . during the simulations ,",
    "the coverages with @xmath2 , @xmath23 and @xmath14 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ) as well as the rate of production of @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , respectively ) are measured .",
    "the phase diagram of the yk model is similar to that of the zgb model @xcite , in the sense that both second- and first- order ipt s are observed .",
    "however , in contrast to the zgb model where the absorbing ( poisoned ) states are unique , in the case of the yk such states are mixtures of @xmath31 and @xmath32 as follows from the observation of the left and right sides of the phase diagram , respectively ( figure 1(a ) ) .",
    "the ipt observed close to @xmath33 is continuous and therefore of second - order ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "our estimation of @xmath34 is in agreement with previous calculations , namely @xmath35 ( reference @xcite ) and @xmath36 ( reference@xcite ) .",
    "more interesting , an abrupt first - order ipt is also observed close to @xmath37 ( figure 1(a ) and ( b ) ) , in agreement with previous simulations ( references @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noticed that a reactive window for the yk model is observed on the hexagonal lattice ( see figure 1 ) while such window is absent on the square lattice @xcite , pointing out the relevance of the coordination number on the reactivity .",
    "= 2.5 in = 1.57 in    = 2.5 in = 1.57 in      the constant coverage ensemble ( cc ) was early introduced by ziff and brosilow @xcite to study the first - order ipt of the zgb model .",
    "the first step of the cc ensemble is to obtain a stationary configuration using the standard ensemble .",
    "then the system is actually switched to the cc ensemble , where the density @xmath24 is now kept as constant as possible .",
    "for this purpose , if @xmath24 is below the established value , @xmath2 is adsorbed on a randomly selected site .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath24 is greater than the desired value , @xmath13 adsorption attempts on randomly selected sites are performed .",
    "now the effective @xmath2-pressure ( @xmath38 ) is given by the ratio of @xmath2-adsorption attempts to the total number of adsorption attempts .",
    "it is worth mentioning that using the cc method as proposed by ziff and brosilow @xcite , the actual coverage with @xmath2 is not strictly constant but it is affected by fluctuations of the order of @xmath39 . very recently",
    "@xcite , a true constant coverage ensemble , where the number of particles remains strictly constant , has been proposed and used to study the conserved contact process .",
    "this new method seems to be very useful for the study of single particle systems , such as the contact process , branching annihilating walkers , etc . ,",
    "although their implementation for complex multiparticle systems , such as the yk model , does not appear to be straightforward .    in simulations , @xmath38 is averaged over @xmath40 time steps .",
    "subsequently , @xmath24 is increased stepwise and measurements of @xmath38 are performed after some waiting time @xmath41 to allow the relaxation of the system . in this way",
    "the growing branch ( gb ) of the cc loop can be obtained .",
    "then , after reaching a large value of @xmath24 ( @xmath42 in this work in order to prevent the system from reaching an absorbing state as shown in figure 1 ) , @xmath24 is decreased stepwise . using this procedure",
    "the decreasing branch ( db ) of the cc loop can be recorded .",
    "it should be noticed that in the cc ensemble @xmath24 assumes the role of the control parameter .",
    "further details on the cc method can be found in references @xcite .",
    "another powerful approach to the study of ipt s is to perform the so - called epidemic analysis ( ea ) @xcite . in ea",
    "the simulations start from a configuration very close to the absorbing state and subsequently the time evolution of the system is followed using the standard ensemble ( se ) . in order to generate the initial configuration",
    ", a natural absorbing state has to be achieved first using the se and following the dynamics of the system .",
    "this procedure assures the development of the characteristic correlations among the reactants . taking the obtained absorbing state , a small patch of empty sites",
    "is created close to the center of the sample .",
    "subsequently , during the time evolution of the system the average number of empty sites ( @xmath43 ) and the survival probability @xmath44 of the active state are recorded .",
    "each single ea stops when the system is trapped in the absorbing state so that @xmath45 . in order to obtain reliable results ,",
    "the quantities of interest have to be averaged over a large number of independent ea ( @xmath46@xmath47x@xmath48 runs in the present work ) .    performing ea close the second - order ipt the",
    "scaling ansatz @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is an exponent , has been proposed to hold at criticality @xcite .",
    "this observation is in agreement with well established ideas developed by studying equilibrium ( reversible ) phase transition : scale invariance reflects the existence of a divergency in the correlation length .",
    "however , close to first - order transition it is also well known that correlations are short ranged , preventing the observation of scale invariance .",
    "recently monetti and albano @xcite have proposed that , at coexistence , @xmath43 should decrease according to a short - time power law followed by a long - time exponential decay , so that : @xmath51 \\label{anz}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 sets a characteristic crossover time scale and @xmath53 is an effective exponent .",
    "it should be noticed that equation ( [ anz ] ) holds for the zgb model at coexistence @xcite .",
    "in order to study hysteretic effects cc simulations using lattices of different sizes and various values of @xmath41 have been performed .",
    "since the measurement in time ( @xmath40 ) has to be reduced in order to observe hysteretic effects , results are averaged over several ( @xmath54 ) different loops , depending on the lattice size , in order to obtain acceptable statistics .",
    "figure 2 shows a plot of @xmath24 vs. @xmath38 as obtained using @xmath55 , @xmath56 mcs , and @xmath57 mcs .",
    "for this small lattice size the relaxation time is quite short , so that hysteretic effects are absent .",
    "this result is in agreement with similar measurements performed applying the cc ensemble to the zgb model @xcite .",
    "note that a narrow vertical region close to the center of the loop for ( @xmath58 ) can also be observed in figure 2 . on the other hand , the @xmath59-dependent upper spinodal point ( @xmath60 )",
    "can also clearly be observed as shown in figure 2 . on increasing the lattice size ( @xmath61 , in figure 3 ) ,",
    "the onset of hysteretic effects can be observed for @xmath62 mcs ( figure 3(a ) ) , while such effects become almost negligible if the waiting time is increased ( figure 3(b ) for @xmath63 mcs ) .",
    "furthermore , as in the case of figure 2 , a vertical region located at the center of the loop and slightly above @xmath58 can be observed in figure 3(a ) .",
    "also notice that such region becomes well defined when @xmath41 is increased ( figure 3(b ) ) .",
    "= 3.0 in    on increasing the lattice the hysteretic effects can be observed even taking larger values of @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath64 ( figure 4(a ) ) and @xmath65 ( figure 4(b ) ) , hysteresis is still observed for @xmath66 mcs and @xmath67 mcs respectively .",
    "= 3.5 in    it should be noticed that the loop becomes narrow when the lattice size is increased , as follows from the comparison of figures ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . comparing these figures",
    "it also becomes evident that while the location of @xmath68 is shifted systematically toward lower values when @xmath59 is increased , the location of the vertical region ( close to the center of the loops ) remains almost fixed very close to @xmath69 ( see figure 4(b ) ) .",
    "the evaluation of a cc loop for @xmath70 requires huge cpu resources , so we have restricted ourselves to the case @xmath71 mcs and @xmath72 mcs , since considerably larger values of @xmath40 became prohibitive . in this case ( figure 5 ) hysteretic effects are quite evident and also , the growing and decreasing branches of the loops are almost vertical . however , the vertical region at the center of the loop , previously observed using smaller lattices , is no longer found .",
    "= 3.5 in    = 1.8 in    in order to gain insight into the behavior of the system close to coexistence it is useful to analyze snapshot configurations , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "snapshots are obtained for some relevant points as indicated in figure 4(a ) . just at the upper spinodal point",
    "( figure 6(a ) ) one observes that the active phase remains homogeneous but the nucleation of few @xmath2-clusters has already started .",
    "the biggest one ( close to the lower right hand side in figure 6(a ) ) is compact ( except for the presence of few @xmath14-atoms embedded into the bulk of the @xmath2-cluster ) and has reached the critical nucleation size . at the upper spinodal point one has @xmath73 .",
    "on increasing the @xmath2 coverage this critical nucleus grows up into a solid and compact @xmath2 cluster surrounded by the ( homogeneous ) active phase , as shown in figure 6(b ) .",
    "the coverage with @xmath2 has increased up to @xmath74 , the compact @xmath2 cluster does not percolate and its interface is essentially convex . further increasing @xmath24 causes the @xmath2 cluster to percolate along one direction of the sample , figure 6(c ) .",
    "the hysteresis loop also changes for the growing branch ( as in figure 6(b ) ) to the central region with @xmath75 in figure 6(c ) .",
    "the percolating cluster is quite stable and has an interface essentially flat with a length of the order of @xmath76 .",
    "an additional growth of @xmath2 coverage causes the @xmath2 cluster to percolate along both directions of the lattice ( figure 6(d ) ) . here",
    "the interface of the cluster is essentially concave and the active phase is surrounded by the massive cluster .",
    "since the coverage with @xmath2 is the same ( @xmath75 ) in both figures 6(c ) and 6(d ) , the presence of hysteretic effects has to be related to the curvature of the interface of the @xmath2 cluster .",
    "subsequently , on decreasing @xmath24 one observes the formation of a @xmath2 cluster that percolates along only one direction of the sample ( figure 6(e ) )",
    ". such kind of clusters are observed along the vertical region and are characterized by an almost flat interface with an infinite effective curvature radius .",
    "notice that despite the fact that the @xmath2 coverage is the same in both figures 6(b ) and 6(e ) ( @xmath74 ) , the curvature of the interface of the @xmath2 cluster is quite different and hysteretic effects are observed ( see figure 4(a ) ) .",
    "= 2.0 in = 2.0 in    = 2.0 in = 2.0 in    = 2.0 in    summing up , the sequence of snapshots shown in figure 6 , as well as additional figures not shown here for the sake of space , allows us to infer the following behavior of the interface of the @xmath2 cluster along the hysteresis loop : between the spinodal point and the growing branch the curvature radius of the interface is positive and finite . along the vertical region",
    "the radius of curvature is infinite , while within the decreasing branch the radius of curvature is negative and finite .",
    "almost horizontal regions observed in the loops correspond to regions where the curvature radius crosses over between two different behaviors .    in order to quantitatively",
    "analyze the behavior of @xmath17 corresponding to the different branches and the vertical region , it is assumed that the growing ( decreasing ) branch starts at the point where both curves merge ( split out ) .",
    "figure 7 shows the dependence of the location of the growing branch and the decreasing branch ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively ) on the inverse of the lattice size .",
    "the @xmath79dependence of @xmath17 at the vertical region ( @xmath80 ) has also been included for the sake of comparison .",
    "= 3.0 in    as already discussed the location of all relevant points , namely @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 depend on the curvature radius ( @xmath84 ) of interface of the massive @xmath2 cluster .",
    "such dependence can be written as follows : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the location of the point under consideration after proper extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit and @xmath87 is an @xmath84-dependent function . for the vertical region one has @xmath88 and @xmath80 is almost independent of @xmath59 , so @xmath89 , as shown in figure 7 .",
    "in contrast , for the db and the gb , @xmath84 is finite and of the order of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "so , one has @xmath92 while @xmath93 .",
    "all these arguments can be confirmed by the results shown in figure 7 and the extrapolated points are :    @xmath94    @xmath95    @xmath96    respectively . also , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are obtained .",
    "the observed behavior allows us to identify @xmath99 as the coexistence point @xmath100 in excellent agreement with the value @xmath101 reported by brosilow and ziff ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result is in contrast with measurements performed with the zgb model .",
    "in fact , for the zgb systems the vertical region is not observed while the locations of the growing and decreasing branches are almost independent of the lattice size @xcite .",
    "consequently , the cc ensemble does not provide a method suitable for the location of the coexistence point that has to be estimated using the spontaneous creation method @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the difference observed between the models may be due to the different behavior of the interface of the massive @xmath2 cluster .",
    "so , we are planning to perform extensive simulations on this subject to clarify this open question .",
    "= 3.0 in    pointing our attention to the upper spinodal point , it is found that its location depends on the lattice size , so @xmath102 can be determined from the loop , as shown in figures ( 2 - 4 ) .",
    "it is expected that this dependence of @xmath102 is due to local fluctuations of the @xmath2 coverage that take place during the nucleation of the critical cluster . in order to check this conjecture , the probability distribution of the _ local _",
    "@xmath2 coverage @xmath103 in small patches of side @xmath104 was measured for lattices of different sizes .",
    "it should be noticed that , in order to perform these measurements , the cc algorithm that keeps the _ global _ coverage of @xmath2 almost constant has been used . setting @xmath105 , i.e. a value slightly smaller than the coverage at the upper spinodal point ,",
    "the probability distributions shown in figure 8 have been obtained . for a rather small lattice ( @xmath106 in figure 8)",
    "@xmath107 is almost symmetric around the maximum @xmath108 .",
    "however , on increasing the lattice size the peak is shifted toward lower @xmath24 values and the distribution function is clearly asymmetric .",
    "while the left - hand side remains practically independent of finite size effects ( say for @xmath109 lu ) , an increasingly long tail emerges on the right hand side of the distribution ( for a detailed view see the inset of figure 8) .",
    "the existence of these non - vanishing tails implies that fluctuations of the _ local _",
    "@xmath2 coverage up to relatively large values are present in larger samples .",
    "such excursions of the coverage induce the nucleation of critical @xmath2 clusters in larger lattices for smaller adsorption probabilities of @xmath2 , consequently @xmath102 must decrease upon increasing @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , figure 9 , which shows a plot of @xmath102 versus @xmath110 , confirms this trend . as a first approximation",
    "the data can be fitted by a straight line that gives @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore our estimate for the coverage is @xmath112 .",
    "these results point out that in the thermodynamic limit the spinodal point is very close to coexistence , i.e. @xmath113 . for the sake of comparison it is worth mentioning that for the zgb model one has @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "= 3.0 in      in order to perform epidemic studies it is necessary to account for the fact that the poisoned ( absorbing ) state above coexistence is non - unique , since it is due to a mixture of @xmath2 and @xmath14 atoms with coverage @xmath115 and @xmath116 , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "so , the starting configuration has to be obtained running the actual dynamics of the system slightly above coexistence until natural absorbing states suitable for the studies are generated .",
    "extensive epidemic simulations ( @xmath117x@xmath48 different runs ) have been performed for the following values of @xmath17 : @xmath118 , @xmath60 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "a value close to coexistence but slightly inside the active region , namely @xmath121 , has also been used .",
    "the obtained results can be observed in figure 10 , which shows log - log plots of @xmath43 versus @xmath122 .",
    "it becomes evident that the method is quite sensitive to tiny changes of @xmath17 .",
    "the obtained curves are fitted by equation ( [ anz ] ) , as shown in figure 10 for @xmath118 .",
    "the best fits are obtained for the parameters listed in table i.    = 3.0 in    it is concluded that close to coexistence one has @xmath123 with a characteristic time @xmath124 mcs except for @xmath125 with @xmath126 mcs , a result that may reflect the fact that this point actually lies within the active region of the phase diagram .",
    "in fact , in the active region larger @xmath52 values are expected , as judged by the results shown in figure 10 .    of course",
    ", one may obtain better fits using different scaling ansatz than that in equation ( [ anz ] ) .",
    "our main finding , however , is that the occurrence of a power - law scaling behavior close to coexistence can unambiguously be ruled out .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with recent numerical data obtained with the zgb model @xcite .",
    "all these observations are also in agreement with the experience gained studying first - order reversible phase transitions where it is well established that correlations are short ranged , preventing the emergency of scale invariance .",
    "let us now point our attention to the run performed taking @xmath121 ( figure 10 ) .",
    "a rapid decrease in @xmath43 up to @xmath127 mcs due to the low survivability of the initial empty patch is observed .",
    "however , for @xmath128 mcs only few epidemics survive ( actually around @xmath129 epidemics over @xmath48 ) and the average number of empty sites increases according to @xmath130 , indicating the homogeneous propagation of the epidemic . for @xmath131 mcs",

    "* results obtained fitting the data corresponding to different values of @xmath17 , shown in figure 10 , using equation ( 5 ) .",
    "in summary , after an extensive monte carlo simulation study of the first - order irreversible phase transition of the yk model for the catalized @xmath1 reaction we concluded that : i ) hysteretic effects are found around the coexistence using the constant - coverage ensemble .",
    "the hysteresis loop basically exhibits three characteristic regions : a growing branch ( gb ) , a vertical region ( vr ) and a decreasing branch ( db ) . within each region",
    "the massive @xmath2 cluster corresponding to the inactive phase has a well defined convex ( gb ) , concave ( db ) and flat ( vr ) curvature . we are planning to study the dynamics of such interface in order to clarify the interplay between hysteresis and interfacial properties such as effective surface tension , roughness , curvature , etc .",
